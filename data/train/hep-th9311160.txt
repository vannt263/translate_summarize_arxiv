    "the density matrix of one - mode gaussian nonclassical light may be related to the problem of minimization of the heisenberg uncertainty relation @xcite and the shcrdinger uncertainty relation @xcite,@xcite.thus for the squeezed light @xcite , @xcite the product of quadrature dispersions is equal to the lowest limit of the heisenberg inequality.in ref .",
    "@xcite the correlated state of light has been found to minimize the schrdinger inequality.the squeezed nonclassical light differs from the coherent state light @xcite in particular by the properties of photon distribution function.thus for coherent light it is usual poisson distribution which is smooth function with one maximum near the mean of photon number .",
    "it is shown in refs.@xcite,@xcite that the photon distribution function of the squeezed light for some values of squeezing parameters has strongly oscillating behaviour.in ref .",
    "@xcite the oscillatory character of photon distribution was demonstrated for the correlated light.squeezed and correlated states as well as coherent states are the partial cases of the gaussian light whose density matrix in wigner representation is described by generic gaussian function determined by five real parameters which are two photon quadrature means @xmath0 , @xmath1 and three elements of quadrature dispersion matrix @xmath2,@xmath3,@xmath4.the distribution function for such generic gaussian density matrix has been expressed in terms of hermite polynomials of two variables in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .    in this work",
    "we address the question how the thermal noise influences the photon distribution function oscillations for squeezed and correlated light .",
    "the aim of this work is to show explicitly that photon distribution oscillations are decreasing when the temperature increases both for the squeezed light and for the correlated light.we study the dependence of these oscillations decreasing on the quadrature squeezing and correlation coefficient .",
    "also we discuss how the oscillations of photon distribution function for squeezed and correlated light deform the planck distribution formula .",
    "we study the photon distribution oscillations using the analytical expressions found in refs.@xcite,@xcite .",
    "as it was shown in @xcite the density matrix of the generic gaussian state of one mode oscillator corresponding to the temperature @xmath5 is described by the formula = k _ k= 2 , where _ = 2 . for the state ( 2 ) we have planck distribution formula |n = .",
    "the operator @xmath6 determines the generic linear canonical transformation of quadratures of the form kak = ua+va+ , where the complex numbers @xmath7,@xmath8 and @xmath9 are the parameters of this transformation satisfying the condition    operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this transformation , which belongs to the group @xmath12 , is determined by these parameters that label the state ( 1 ) . as it was shown in ref.@xcite",
    "the five real parameters @xmath13 determining generic gaussian state of one mode field oscillator are related to the temperature and canonical transformation parameters by the relations @xmath14 where e=|n + .",
    "the parameters of canonical transformation are expressed in terms of the squeezing parameter @xmath15 and correlation parameter @xmath16 by @xmath17 where = _ v - . in terms of the temperature and of the canonical transformation parameters the photon distribution function has been obtained in ref.@xcite where it was expressed through the hermite polynomials of two variables with the equal indices.since these parameters are related to the quadrature means and dispersion matrix by the formulae written above the expression of the photon distribution function can be given in the form obtained in @xcite p_n = p_0 , where the probability to have no photon is given by the formula p_0=(d+t+ ) ^- , the complex parameter @xmath18 is given by the relation = 2 ^ -(<q>+i < p > ) , and the symmetric matrix @xmath19 determining hermite polynomial has the matrix elements expressed in terms of the quadrature dispersion matrix as follows @xmath20 arguments of the hermite polynomials are of the form y_1=y_2^*=(t-2d-)^-1[(t-1)<z^*>+ ( _ pp-_qq+2i_pq)<z > ] . in above formulae the trace @xmath21 of the quadrature dispersion matrix and its determinant @xmath22",
    "are used t=_pp+_qq and d=_pp_qq-_pq^2 . for the pure states the parameter @xmath22 is equal to 1/4 .",
    "the obtained expression for photon distribution function is convinient for the numerical analysis since there exists the relation of the hermite polynomial of two variables in terms of the usual hermite polynomial and using this formula the following photon distribution function for the squeezed and correlated light subject to thermal noise has been written down in @xcite p_n= p_0n!_k=0^n()^n/2 ( - ) ^k(n - k)!^-2k!^-1 |h_n - k()|^2 . here",
    "the matrix elements of the matrix @xmath19 are given by the formulae ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) and the components @xmath23 and @xmath24 are given by formula ( 19 ) . if one calculates the mean value of photon number @xmath25 corresponding to this distribution the deformed planck distribution formula",
    "may be obtained @xcite .",
    "the correction to usual planck distribution depends on the squeezing parameter @xmath15 and the shift parameter @xmath18.this correction does not depend on the quadrature correlation coefficient .",
    "so we have @xmath26 but the width of the photon distribution depends on the correlation of the quadrature components @xcite .",
    "thus the presence of the oscillations of the photon distribution function for squeezed and correlated light is related to the deformation of planck distribution formula .",
    "the correlation coefficient @xmath27 of the photon quadratures may be related to the squeezing parameter @xmath15 and the phase @xmath16 according to the formula @xmath28 the modulus of the correlation coefficient is always less than 1 . for the squeezed states the condition of minimisation of heisenberg uncertainty relation @xcite for photon quadratures",
    "is fulfilled @xmath29 for the correlated states @xcite the condition of minimisation of schrdinger uncertainty relation @xcite @xmath30 is realized , i.e .",
    "@xmath31 for @xmath32 the schrdinger uncertainty relation becomes the heisenberg inequality .",
    "thus we have extra physical parameter @xmath27 which is the photon quadrature correlation coefficient .",
    "using the general formula ( 22 ) we will analyse the behaviour of photon distribution function at different values of the parameters @xmath33 . for the case of zero quadrature correlation and zero temperature",
    "the photon distribution function demonstrates the oscillatory behaviour for the large squeezing .",
    "we present in fig.1 the plot of photon distribution function for very low ( almost zero ) temperature @xmath34 ( solid curve ) , and for larger temperature @xmath35 ( dashed curve ) , for both cases we have zero quadrature correlation coefficient @xmath32 and the shift parameter @xmath36   ( the squeezing parameter @xmath15 is taken to be @xmath37 ) .",
    "the plot demonstrates the oscillations of photon distribution function found in ref.@xcite .    if one takes into account the possible correlation of the photon quadrature components , assuming the correlation coefficient to be nonzero , the oscillations of the photon distribution function are available too .",
    "this result has been obtained in ref.@xcite    in fig.2 the plot of photon distribution function is given for @xmath38 , @xmath37 , @xmath36   while @xmath39 ( solid ) , @xmath40 ( dashed ) .",
    "we see that the oscillations of the photon distribution function for the squeezed light are sensitive to the presence of the quadrature correlation since the shape of the curve changes when the parameter @xmath27 changes , in fact it oscillates more rapidly than the previous one .",
    "fig.3 shows the photon distribution for the case @xmath41 ,   @xmath37 , @xmath36 .",
    "one can see the essential difference of the plot from the previous one .",
    "it shows physical relevance of the correlation between photon quadrature components .",
    "fig . 4 and 5 present the 3 - dimensional plots of photon distribution function for the squeezed and correlated light with the parameters @xmath42 in fig.4 , and @xmath43 in fig.5 , as a function of temperature ( abscissa ) and photon number ( ordinate ) .",
    "we see that all the amplitudes of the oscillations of photon distribution for squeezed and correlated light decrease when the temperature increases . for high temperatures",
    "the oscillations tend to disappear .",
    "one could obtain an estimation of the temperature dependence of the photon distribution function ( 14 ) for high temperature if the expansion of the density matrix into power series is used .",
    "then for fixed photon number @xmath44 and @xmath45 we have approximate expression @xmath46,\\ ] ] which is valid for not very large @xmath44 .",
    "thus the probability to have @xmath44 - photons at high temperatures decreases proportionally to @xmath47 . in the graphs of type presented in fig.4",
    "this behaviuor maight be seen if one takes the plot which may be obtained in the intersection of the plane crossing the photon number axis in @xmath48 parallel to the temperature and @xmath49 axis . at high temperatures",
    "the decreasing of the photon probability corresponds just to this law if the temperature is so large that corrections term in ( 28 ) is much less than 1 .",
    "also the correction to this general behaviour are decreasing with the temperature .",
    "as we have shown for both kinds of one - mode gaussian classical light , namely , for the squeezed light and for the correlated light the thermal noise supresses the oscillations of photon distribution function .",
    "the presence of oscillations of the photon distribution function for squeezed and correlated light produces the deformation of the planck distribution formula and the correction to the planck distribution is dependent on the squeezing parameter.generalization of the obtained results for two - mode and polymode squeezed and correlated light may be done on the base of the expressions for the photon distribution function of the generic gaussian light in terms of multivariable hermite polynomials found in ref.@xcite .",
