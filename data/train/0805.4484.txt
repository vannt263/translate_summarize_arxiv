    "ultra - cold atom experiments display amazing versatility and promise to improve our understanding of many particle physics .",
    "there is now hope for direct experimental realization of many models which were constructed as effective models of condensed matter systems , such as the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "however , the extent of the ultra - cold atom experiments are not limited to previously discussed models , novel systems such as dipolar @xcite and spinor gases @xcite are created as well . through the interplay of these experiments and theories aimed at explaining or stimulating them , a better understanding of quantum many particle physics emerges .",
    "one of the problems that has been discussed extensively in the condensed matter literature , but never experimentally realized is the effect of a periodic potential under high magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "when the magnetic flux through the unit cell of the periodic potential is of the order of one flux quantum , the energy spectrum displays complex magnetic fine structure within the bloch bands .",
    "conventional condensed matter systems with lattice constants in the order of nanometers require thousands of tesla magnetic fields to be able to see these effects , which is very far from being experimentally feasible .",
    "recently a number of authors have argued that this model can be realized in a cold atom set - up within current experimental capability @xcite .",
    "as the atoms are neutral the magnetic field is expected to be created either by rotating the optical lattice , or by optically induced potentials .",
    "a weak rotating optical lattice has already been realized in vortex pinning experiments @xcite , and there is ongoing work about creating effective magnetic fields via light induced coupling @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of these systems promise interesting phenomena such as lattice quantum hall effects @xcite or the observation of topological conductance quantization @xcite .",
    "most of the recent theory , as well as the previous investigations in the condensed matter literature are focused on the lowest ( _ s_- ) band of the lattice . an important reason for this focus is that the magnetic fine structure of this lowest band is very well described by the peierls substitution @xcite . the resulting band structure for the split _ s_-band is easily obtained from a difference equation and is a self - similar fractal , known as the hofstadter butterfly @xcite .",
    "the original tight - binding hamiltonian is modified only by the addition of phases to hopping amplitudes and serves as a starting point for the investigation of many - body physics in this system .    an exciting development in cold atom physics",
    "has been the realization that higher bands in an optical lattice are also experimentally accessible @xcite .",
    "the physics of the first excited band , the _",
    "p_-band , contains surprises such as bose condensation at non - zero momentum @xcite , or orbitally ordered mott insulators @xcite . for a system of fermions _",
    "p_-band physics can be accessed trivially by filling the _ s_-band completely ; surprisingly the relaxation time for bosons in the _",
    "p_-band is long enough to allow experimental access to pure _ p_-band physics .",
    "a natural question to ask about the _",
    "p_-band physics is how the particles in the _",
    "p_-band respond to the effective magnetic field created by rotation .",
    "experimentally , if a strong rotating optical lattice is realized , the _ p_-band should be as accessible as the _ s_-band .",
    "one can imagine the already rich physics of the _",
    "p_-band @xcite to be strongly affected by the magnetic field , as both the orbital order within each lattice site and the hopping between different lattice sites will be modified . beyond the single particle physics ,",
    "it is not clear how the various many particle phases , such as orbitally ordered mott insulators , will be affected by rotation .",
    "the theoretical investigation of such effects requires a consistent method of incorporating the phases generated by the magnetic field into the lattice hamiltonian . for the _ s_-band , peierls substitution , in which one builds an effective hamiltonian by replacing @xmath0 with @xmath1 in the energy band function gives a satisfactory description of the one particle physics @xcite . starting from this effective hamiltonian",
    "interaction effects can be investigated .",
    "the accuracy of peierls substitution for the _ s_-band has been checked by numerical solutions of the schrdinger equation @xcite . however , as for degenerate bands ( of which the _ p_-band is the simplest example ) the conjecture was that  wherever the unperturbed bloch bands touch or overlap , it is not possible to obtain the magnetic sub - structure by semiclassical methods , even approximately , by means of a universal rule for the whole brillouin zone \" @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we generalize the peierls substitution procedure to the _ p_-band , and obtain an effective hamiltonian for the _ p_-band of the rotating optical lattice .",
    "we show that after an appropriate diagonalization in @xmath0 space , which assumes temporarily that only the on - site energies are affected by the degeneracy lifting field , peierls substitution is still a good option to obtain the detailed magnetic fine structure .",
    "we check the spectrum obtained from the effective hamiltonian with an accurate numerical solution of the two - dimensional schrdinger equation and obtain excellent agreement .",
    "this method should in principle be applicable to other degenerate bands and it provides us with a means to examine inter - particle interactions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we introduce the hamiltonian for a rotating optical lattice , and discuss the tight binding limit .",
    "section iii contains a discussion of the peierls substitution scheme , the resulting magnetic fine structure , and its comparison with direct numerical solutions . in section iv , we give the effective hamiltonian including interactions and conclude in section v.",
    "we start with the hamiltonian for a particle in the rotating frame of a two - dimensional square lattice @xmath2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",

    "what follows , we use photon recoil energy @xmath12 as the energy unit .",
    "this hamiltonian can be rearranged as    @xmath13 \\\\ & + &      \\frac{1}{2}m(\\omega_{\\bot}^2-\\omega^2)r^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we neglect the last term assuming that @xmath7 is very close to @xmath6 , so essentially we deal with a particle under an effective magnetic field @xmath14 in a lattice potential .",
    "we assume that @xmath8 is deep enough for a tight - binding description to apply to the system and furthermore concentrate on the dynamics of the particles in the first excited ( @xmath15- ) band of the lattice .",
    "our approach is to first cast this hamiltonian into a second quantized form which includes the anisotropic hopping between nearest neighbor sites , the on - site zero point energies , and also the shift caused by rotation .",
    "not only do we expect the hopping between lattice sites to be affected , as it was for the _ s_-band , but also the on - site energies to be modified .",
    "however , since the hopping and on - site hamiltonians do not commute , a common transformation that accounts for both modifications can not be found .    to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we temporarily assume that the hopping amplitudes are not affected by the effective magnetic field and the only change is in the on - site energies .",
    "our expectation is that in this way we will obtain two non - degenerate bands to which we can apply peierls substitution .",
    "this procedure is rather _ ad hoc _ the validity of which is later checked through a comparison with the first - principles results presented previously @xcite and reproduced here partially .",
    "we proceed with considering the following _ p_-band tight - binding hamiltonian ( the energy spectrum of which is measured relative to the center of the tight - binding _",
