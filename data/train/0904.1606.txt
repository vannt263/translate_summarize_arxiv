    "furthermore , given the very similar cn-16 frank - kasper polyhedron for r ions , as well as the less than 2% difference of lattice constants for the whole rt@xmath0zn@xmath1 families , the study of the cef effect on these local moment members will also help in the understanding of the varied heavy fermion states of ybt@xmath0zn@xmath1 , which were thought to be due to the competition between temperature scales associated with the cef splitting and the kondo effect.@xcite    in this paper , we present the results of magnetization , heat capacity and resistivity measurements on rfe@xmath0zn@xmath1 and rco@xmath0zn@xmath1 ( r = y , nd , sm , gd - lu ) compounds . compared with the weakly correlated behaviors for yco@xmath0zn@xmath1 and luco@xmath0zn@xmath1 , yfe@xmath0zn@xmath1 and lufe@xmath0zn@xmath1 , manifest clear , nffl behaviors associated with the spin fluctuation of the itinerant electrons . for the rfe@xmath0zn@xmath1 compounds ( r = gd - tm ) , the well - defined , local moment members all manifest enhanced fm ordering with @xmath4 values that roughly scale with the de gennes factor .",
    "their anomalous , temperature dependent susceptibility and resistivity can be explained as the result of local moments embedded in a nffl host . in contrast , for the rco@xmath0zn@xmath1 series , only gd and tb members manifest afm ordering above 2  k , and the magnetic properties for r = dy - tm clearly manifest features associated with single ion cef effects on the r ions in the cubic symmetry coordination . for the r",

    "the variation of the lattice constant manifests the well - known , lanthanide contraction for r = gd - lu with no evident deviation for r = yb .",
    "however , the relatively larger lattice constants for yfe@xmath0zn@xmath1 and yco@xmath0zn@xmath1 indicate that , with this large cn , the effective ionic radii of y@xmath3 is between tb@xmath3 and dy@xmath3 rather than between dy@xmath3 and ho@xmath3 .",

    "another interesting phenomena in nearly fm materials is the so - called itinerant electron metamagnetism ( iem ) , which is an applied magnetic field induced , first order , phase transition between a paramagnetic state and spin polarized state @xcite .",
    "experimentally , iem has been observed for yco@xmath0 and luco@xmath0 around 70 t. @xcite within the framework of landau theory , the maximum in temperature dependent susceptibility is thought to be related to iem.@xcite the magnetic part of the free energy @xmath175 can be writen as the function of the magnetic moment @xmath176 : @xmath177 where @xmath178 , @xmath179 and @xmath180 are the landau expansion coefficients .",

    "y(lu)fe@xmath0zn@xmath1 and tibe@xmath0 may represent the examples of nffls different from yco@xmath0 and luco@xmath0 .",

    "this behavior is different from that seen in the rco@xmath0 ( r = gd - tm ) system : the magnetic phase transitions of r = dy - tm members for rco@xmath0 are 1st order whereas r = gd and tb members have 2nd order transitions@xcite .",
    "this difference is not difficult to explain in landau theory : unlike y(lu)co@xmath0 , the host of y(lu)fe@xmath0zn@xmath1 lack of ability to show iem and therefore can not be induced to show metamagnetic transition by any molecular field associated with the @xmath2 local moments .",
    "rfe@xmath0zn@xmath1 and rco@xmath0zn@xmath1 ( r = gd - lu , y ) demonstrate diverse magnetic properties .",
    "the conspicuous differences between these two related series are mainly associated with the conduction electron polarizability of the host ( non - magnetic ) compounds . yfe@xmath0zn@xmath1 and lufe@xmath0zn@xmath1 manifest similar , nearly ferromagnetic properties . when the @xmath2 local moments are embedded in this highly polarizable medium , the rfe@xmath0zn@xmath1 ( r = gd - tm ) series shows highly enhanced fm ordering temperatures .",

    "tbco@xmath0zn@xmath1 show low temperature afm ordering , and the magnetic properties for rco@xmath0zn@xmath1 ( r = dy - tm ) are more strongly influenced by the cef splitting of the r ions ( the dominant energy scale ) .",

    "figure [ figappentb ] shows the magnetization ( at h = 1000 oe ) and zero applied field resistivity for three batches of tbfe@xmath0zn@xmath1 , which were synthesized from different initial molar ratio of starting elements , tb : fe : zn = 2:3:95 , 2:4:94 and 2:5:93 . the ferromagnetic ordering temperatures , determined as @xmath188  k , @xmath189  k and @xmath190  k by resistivity measurements for the three samples , increase as the initial concentration of fe in the solution increases .",
    "we also found similar features for r = gd and er , but the variation of their @xmath4 values are less than in the tb case ( fig .",

    "comparative , single crystal x - ray diffraction measurements performed on the samples , albeit inconclusive , indicated that the crystallographic difference were perhaps due to subtle variations of occupancy of the fe site.@xcite the main difficulty associated with the x - ray diffraction measurement was completely resolving the mixed site occupancies for zn and fe which have similar atomic number values . recently ,",

    "all these crystallographic measurements indicate the sensitivity of the magnetic properties to the small disorder for rfe@xmath0zn@xmath1 in this family which has local moments submerged in a highly polarizable conduction electron matrix .      as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1poly ] , the distance between the rare earth ion and the zn nns , as well as nnns , is close to 3   ; whereas the distance with the next next nearest neighbors ( nnnn , 6 zn in @xmath192 site ) is larger than 5   . due to this isolated , cage - like coordinate of rare earth ions , the effect of ions other than this cn-16 frank - kasper polyhedron can be neglected in the calculation of the cef coefficients , based on the point charge model .    appreciably , the ligands of the rare earth ions in the c-15 laves compounds ( rni@xmath0 ) form a same polyhedron , whose cef coefficients have been calculated by b. bleaney @xcite , based on the point charge model .",
    "therefore , one can directly cite the results :        where @xmath195 and @xmath196 are the charge of the nn and nnn ions ( @xmath197 for zn@xmath198 ) , @xmath199 and @xmath200 is the distance between the r ion and the two sets of ions , @xmath201 and @xmath202 are the mean fourth and sixth powers of the electronic radius for the @xmath2-electrons , and @xmath63 and @xmath66 are the steven multiplicative factors . extracting the values of @xmath201 and @xmath202 from ref.@xcite , @xmath63 and @xmath66 values from ref.@xcite , and @xmath199 and @xmath200 values from the results of single crystal x - ray diffraction@xcite , one can calculate the @xmath203 and @xmath204 values ( shown in table [ table3 ] ) ."
