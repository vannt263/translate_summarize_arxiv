    "recently , observations of compact stars have provided new data of high accuracy which put strong constraints on the high - density behaviour of the equation of state of strongly interacting matter otherwise not accessible in terrestrial laboratories . in particular , the high masses of @xmath2 and @xmath3 obtained in very recent measurements on the millisecond pulsars psr b1516 + 02b and psr j1748 - 2021b , repectively @xcite , together with the large radius of @xmath1 km for the isolated neutron star rx j1856.5 - 3754 ( shorthand : rx j1856 ) @xcite point to a stiff equation of state at high densities .",
    "measurements of high masses are also reported for compact stars in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) as , e.g. , @xmath4 for the compact object in 4u 1636 - 536 @xcite . for another lmxb , exo 0748 - 676 ,",
    "constraints for the mass @xmath5 _ and _ the radius @xmath6 km have been derived @xcite .",
    "the status of these data is , however , unclear since the observation of a gravitational redshift @xmath7 in the x - ray burst spectra @xcite could not be confirmed thereafter despite numerous attempts @xcite .",
    "measurements of rotation periods below @xmath8 ms as discussed for xte j1739 - 285 @xcite , on the other hand , would disfavor too large objects corresponding to a stiff eos and would thus leave only a tiny window of very massive stars in the mass - radius plane @xcite for a theory of compact star matter to fulfill all above mentioned constraints .",
    "[ ht ]    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     as a unified description of quark - hadron matter , naturally including a description of the phase transition , is not available yet , although steps in this direction have been suggested within nonrelativistic @xcite and relativistic @xcite models .",
    "we apply here the so - called two - phase description , being aware of its limitations .",
    "the nuclear matter phase is described within the dbhf approach and the transition to the quark matter phase given above is obtained by a maxwell construction . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ f : p - n ] it can be seen that the necessary softening of the high density eos in accordance with the flow constraint is obtained for a vector coupling of @xmath9 whereas an appropriate deconfinement density is obtained for a strong diquark coupling in the range @xmath10 .",
    "the resulting phase transition is weakly first order with an almost negligible density jump . applying this hybrid eos with so defined free parameters under compact star conditions a sequence of hybrid star configurations",
    "is obtained which fulfills all modern constraints , see the left panel of fig .",
    "2 . in that figure",
    "we also indicate by a red dot the minimal mass @xmath11 for which the central density reaches a value allowing the fast direct urca ( du ) cooling process in dbhf neutron star matter to occur , leading to problems with cooling phenomenology @xcite .",
    "note that for a strong diquark coupling @xmath12 , the critical density for quark deconfinement is low enough to prevent the hadronic direct urca ( du ) cooling problem by an early onset of quark matter .",
    "for the given hybrid eos , there is a long sequence of stable hybrid stars with two - flavor superconducting ( 2sc ) quark matter , before the occurrence of the strange quark flavor and the simultaneous onset of the color - flavor - locking ( cfl ) phase which renders the star gravitationally unstable @xcite . comparing the hybrid star sequences with the purely hadronic dbhf ones",
    "one can conclude that the former masquerade themselves as neutron stars @xcite by having very similar mechanical properties .",
    "besides for mass - radius relationships , the masquerade effect can be discussed also for the moment of inertia @xcite , which is becoming accessible to measurements in relativistic binary systems like the double pulsar j07373039 , see @xcite .",
    "[ ht ]    in these proceedings we add a new aspect to this masquerade discussion : the energy release in the neutrino untrapping transition of a cooling protoneutron star ( pns ) .",
    "the process is pictured such that the pns formed in a supernova collapse is hot enough ( @xmath13 mev ) to trap neutrinos since their mean free path is shorter than the size of the star . in this era the fast neutrino cooling can not proceed from the volume but only from the surface . until the neutrino opacity temperature ( @xmath14 mev )",
    "is reached , the neutrinos take part in the @xmath15-equilibration processes and a finite lepton fraction is established .",
    "we will assume @xmath16 corresponding to a neutrino chemical potential @xmath17 mev in the pns core .",
    "for a discussion of hot hybrid pns , see @xcite . in the untrapping transition at @xmath18 , the neutrinos",
    "decouple from the @xmath15-equilibrium so that @xmath19 and the equilibrium configuration gets readjusted with a new gravitational mass while naturally , the baryon number is conserved in this process . from fig .",
    "[ f : untrap ] one can estimate the mass defect ( energy release ) due to neutrino untrapping to @xmath20 , almost independent of the mass of the configuration and even of its structure : neutron stars and hybrid stars result in the same energy release !",
    "this is another aspect of the masquerade effect .",
    "note that the neutrino untrapped configurations fulfill the extended @xmath21 constraint @xcite , given by the rectangle in the right panel of fig.[f : untrap ] .",
    "this constraint is derived from the lighter companion ( star b ) in the double pulsar j07373039 ( b ) @xcite .",
    "to unmask the neutron star interior and to disentangle a quark matter core from a hadronic one , might therefore require observables based on transport properties , strongly modified from normal due to the color superconductivity .",
    "it has been suggested to base tests of the structure of matter at high densities on analyses of the cooling behavior @xcite or the stability of fastly rotating stars against r - modes @xcite .",
    "it has turned out that for these phenomena the fine tuning of color superconductivity in quark matter is an essential ingredient .",
    "the result of these studies suggests that on the one hand unpaired quark matter results in too fast cooling ( same holds for pure two - flavor color superconductivity ( 2sc ) due to one unpaired ( blue ) color ) and on the other , complete pairing with large gaps ( cfl phase , @xmath22 mev ) would result in too slow cooling @xcite , r - mode instability @xcite and gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "viable alternatives for quark matter thus have to be color superconducting , with all quark modes paired , but a few modes ( at least one ) should have a small gap of @xmath23 mev , desirable with a decreasing density dependence , as suggested for the 2sc+x phase @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there is no microscopic model supporting the 2sc+x pairing pattern yet . a suitable candidate , however , could be the recently suggested single flavor pairing in the isotropic spin-1 color superconductivity phase ( iso - csl ) @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the neutrino emissivity and bulk viscosity of the iso - csl phase fulfills constraints from cooling and r - mode stability @xcite .",
    "in this contribution it is shown that modern quantum field theoretical approaches to quark matter including color superconductivity and a vector meanfield allow a microscopic description of hybrid stars which fulfill the new , strong constraints for high masses , large radii , sufficiently fast cooling evolution and absence of r - mode instabilities .",
    "the deconfinement transition in the resulting stiff hybrid equation of state is weakly first order so that signals of it have to be expected due to specific changes in transport properties governing the rotational and cooling evolution caused by the color superconductivity of quark matter .",
    "this conclusion holds analogously for the investigation of quark deconfinement in future generations of nucleus - nucleus collision experiments at low temperatures and high baryon densities , such as cbm @ fair .",
    "the extrapolation of the hybrid eos constrained here from compact star physics results in almost crossover behavior at the deconfinement transition @xcite , so that promising observable effects for its diagnostics shall be based on ( precursor ) effects of color superconductivity .",
