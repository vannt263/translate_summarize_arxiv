    "in recent years , large area spectroscopic surveys of both passive galaxies such as the luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) population , as well as emission line galaxies ( elgs ) , have been successfully used to place accurate constraints on cosmological models ( e.g. @xcite ) . at the same time , deeper , smaller area spectroscopic surveys such as deep2 and vvds as well as multi - wavelength photometric surveys such as combo-17 @xcite , cfhtls @xcite and cosmos @xcite , have enabled detailed studies of galaxy formation and evolution and constraints on the global properties such as the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , ages , stellar masses and star formation histories ( sfhs ) of galaxies out to z@xmath02 .",
    "the advent of very large area photometric surveys at multiple wavelengths now offers us the possibility of constraining the global properties of the large spectroscopic samples that have been assembled for cosmology . although the large area surveys are by their nature very shallow , they contain huge numbers of galaxies at z@xmath11 , therefore enabling a statistically robust census of galaxy properties at these redshifts .",
    "star - forming galaxies at the main epoch of galaxy formation at z@xmath013 have been selected in many different ways .",
    "the most luminous starbursts at these epochs are often selected at long wavelengths such as the far infrared and submillimeter ( e.g. @xcite ) while more modest star - forming galaxies have been targeted using optical colour - cuts such as the lyman break selection ( e.g. @xcite ) , the bm / bx method @xcite and the b@xmath12k technique @xcite .",
    "the availability of uv data from the _ galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) _ has also allowed comprehensive studies of uv - luminous galaxies both in the local universe @xcite and at higher redshifts @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study the physical properties of a population of uv - luminous emission line galaxies selected from within the wigglez dark energy survey @xcite .",
    "although primarily designed as a cosmology survey targeting blue emission line galaxies at intermediate redshifts of z@xmath00.7 , the dataset contains @xmath0215,000 spectroscopically confirmed highly star - forming galaxies that form a very large statistical sample that can also be exploited for galaxy evolution studies ( e.g. @xcite , jurek et al . in preparation ) .",
    "in particular , the redshift range of the wigglez survey coupled with the uv selection means this sample is particularly useful for bridging the gap between analogously selected local galaxies and uv - luminous galaxies at z@xmath131 .",
    "while the large sample size makes targeted multi - wavelength follow - up of the majority of wigglez galaxies unfeasible , one can use existing multi - wavelength photometric datasets to better characterise this population .",
    "identifying synergies between existing multi - wavelength photometric surveys and large redshift surveys like wigglez , is important for several reasons .",
    "firstly , spectroscopic samples such as the wigglez sample serve as important calibration sets for large photometric surveys . as an example , the ongoing dark energy survey ( des ) will detect 300 million galaxies out to z@xmath02 and will overlap the all - sky near infrared ( nir ) vista hemisphere survey ( vhs ) .",
    "the combination of optical and nir data will allow photometric redshifts and sed fit parameters to be constrained for a very large number of galaxies out to z@xmath02 @xcite .",
    "colour selected spectroscopic samples like wigglez may be used as _ training sets _ but will by their nature be incomplete in certain regions of parameter space sampled by flux - limited photometric surveys such as des and vhs . quantifying this incompleteness in terms of the physical properties of the galaxies - i.e. understanding the types of galaxies that constitute currently available spectroscopic samples ,",
    "is a useful exercise in order to better calibrate redshifts from photometric surveys .",
    "next generation spectroscopic surveys like big boss @xcite , 4most @xcite and despec @xcite , will in turn use the photometric surveys as the basis for target selection .",
    "once again , understanding the physical properties of existing spectroscopically confirmed galaxies within these surveys , will help to design colour selection algorithms for new populations in the future .",
    "in this work , we characterise the stellar masses and star formation histories of a large sample of @xmath040,000 galaxies at 0.3@xmath141.0 , corresponding to a single field in the wigglez survey , and focus in particular on the subset of @xmath012,000 of these galaxies that are also matched to the nir ukidss large area survey ( ulas ) .",
    "the advantage of long - wavelength data in the infrared is that it is less sensitive to the dust extinction in galaxies than the uv and optical .",
    "this , combined with the fact that older , more massive stars are brighter in the infrared , means that the infrared data is expected to give a more unbiased estimate of the total stellar mass in galaxies than the uv / optical @xcite .",
    "recent studies have however claimed that the nir actually leads to poorer stellar mass estimates for a sample of intermediate redshift galaxies from the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) survey @xcite .",
    "this worsening in the stellar mass estimates is attributed to uncertainties in the stellar population synthesis models at these wavelengths and/or uncertainties in calibrating the photometry between the optical and nir surveys .",
    "the role of nir photometry in constraining the stellar masses of galaxies therefore still remains open to debate .",
    "the stellar mass estimates themselves are useful for cosmology given that the clustering strengths of galaxy samples split by stellar mass are expected to be different - ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our aim in the current work is therefore also to test the robustness of stellar mass estimates from sed fitting codes , to various assumptions made during the fitting process .",
    "the wigglez galaxies are selected to be extremely blue galaxies @xcite , and as such , represent a sample where sed fitting is likely to be the most problematic . by testing sed fitting codes on this sample",
    ", we can be reasonably confident that the codes can be applied to older , redder and more massive galaxies , which are likely to have less complex star formation histories .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume a flat @xmath15cdm cosmology with @xmath16=0.7 .",
    "all magnitudes are on the ab system where the ukidss photometry has been converted to the ab system using the conversions in @xcite : y=+0.633 , j=+0.937 , h=+1.376 and k=+1.897 .",
    "the vega to ab conversions in the wise bands are assumed to be w1=+2.683 , w2=+3.319 , w3=+5.242 and w4=+6.404 @xcite .",
    "we begin by describing the spectroscopic and photometric catalogues that are used in this work .",
    "spectroscopic data for the uv luminous emission line galaxies is taken from the wigglez dark energy survey @xcite .",
    "the survey has assembled reliable redshifts for 219,682 galaxies in seven different fields .",
    "the spectroscopic targets are selected using ultraviolet data from the _ galex _ satellite @xcite and optical data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) in the north @xcite and the canada france hawaii telescope red sequence cluster survey in the south @xcite .",
    "a series of magnitude and colour cuts are applied to the data to preferentially select star - forming galaxies with bright emission lines which are then targetted using the aaomega spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope @xcite .",
    "full details of the spectroscopic target selection can be found in @xcite but results in a complicated selection function over the total survey area .",
    "this selection function is computed in @xcite where the different sources of incompleteness are fully detailed .",
    "we note in particular that the complicated colour selection of wigglez targets means the sample is incomplete in some regions of redshift , stellar mass and star formation rate parameter space .",
    "-band magnitude versus @xmath17 colour for all wigglez galaxies in the 15hr field at 0.3@xmath141.0 , compared to star - forming galaxies from the deep2 survey and luminous red galaxies from the boss survey , both at similar redshifts to wigglez .",
    "the contours represent the density of points computed using a kernel density estimator over a grid traversing the parameter space covered by the samples .",
    "the wigglez galaxies are brighter than the deep2 sample but slightly bluer than these deep2 galaxies which represent normal star - forming galaxies at these redshifts.,width=321,height=226 ]    in this paper , we work with the wigglez data in the 15hr field only with 209@xmath1ra@xmath1231 and @xmath183.2@xmath1dec@xmath17.2 in order to ensure overlap with currently available infrared datasets from ukidss and _ wise_. this field contains 46,144 galaxies in total down to a flux limit of nuv@xmath122.8 .",
    "all photometric catalogues from the wigglez survey contain the de - reddened galaxy magnitudes and this sample only contains sources with redshift quality between 3 and 5 which corresponds to reliable redshift estimates .",
    "we select only galaxies at 0.3@xmath1z@xmath11.0 for this study which constitutes the bulk of the wigglez population . at higher redshifts ,",
    "the quality of the redshift estimate becomes increasingly unreliable and many of the @xmath19 sources with reliable redshift measurements are agn .",
    "although these agn may contain emission related to star formation , the sed fitting codes used in this work do not allow us to disentangle the contributions of the two .",
    "we are primarily interested in the star - formation dominated wigglez galaxies in this work and so we restrict our redshift range to a regime where the agn make up an insignificant proportion of the population .",
    "our final sample of wigglez galaxies therefore totals 39,701 sources at 0.3@xmath1z@xmath11.0 .",
    "the wigglez magnitudes used throughout this paper correspond to the de - reddened model magnitudes from sdss and _ galex_. the wigglez galaxies are typically @xmath05@xmath3 detections in the _ galex _ nuv band and @xmath210@xmath3 detections in the sdss @xmath20-band .    in order to better illustrate the types of galaxies selected using the wigglez colour cuts , in figure [ fig : select ] we show the observed colour - magnitude distribution of the wigglez galaxies .",
    "this is compared to @xmath019,000 galaxies from the deep2 survey data release 4 @xcite over the same redshift range .",
    "these deep2 galaxies represent typical star - forming galaxies at these redshifts .",
    "we also compare the distribution to @xmath0180,000 luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) over the same redshift range selected from within the sdss boss survey @xcite .",
    "as expected , the wigglez galaxies are considerably bluer and fainter than the lrgs that make up the red sequence at these redshifts . however , despite the brighter flux limit of wigglez compared to deep2 , at a fixed @xmath20-band magnitude , the wigglez selection targets sources that are also bluer than the typical _ blue cloud _ galaxies that make up the deep2 sample . in other words ,",
    "the wigglez selection is isolating the most extreme end of the blue galaxy population at any given luminosity .",
    "the ukidss large area survey @xcite is the current largest nir survey and has obtained imaging over @xmath03200 deg@xmath21 of the northern sky in the @xmath22,@xmath23,@xmath24 and @xmath25 bands .",
    "the survey is being carried out using the wide field camera ( wfcam ) on the 3.8 m uk infrared telescope ( ukirt ) .",
    "ukidss , which began in 2005 , is the successor to the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) and is the nir counterpart to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "we use data release 9 of the ukidss las ( ulasdr9 ) in this work , which reaches nominal 5@xmath3 depths of @xmath22=20.8 , @xmath23=20.5 , @xmath24=20.2 and @xmath25=20.1 . throughout this work ,",
    "we use the petrosian magnitudes in the ukidss catalogues as the ukidss catalogues do not include model magnitudes .",
    "these petrosian magnitudes serve as a reasonable estimate of the total nir flux of the galaxy .",
    "differences between the sdss petrosian magnitudes and sdss model magnitudes of galaxies are of the order of 15 per cent @xcite .",
    "we match the wigglez galaxies in the 15hr field to ukidss using a matching radius of 2@xmath26 .",
    "the median separation between the wigglez and ukidss sources is @xmath00.3@xmath26 .",
    "11,919 of the original 39,701 galaxies are detected at @xmath25@xmath3 in at least one of the ukidss bands corresponding to 30 per cent of the wigglez sample .",
    "the redshift distribution for this ukidss detected sub - sample is very similar to that of the entire population at 0.3@xmath141.0 with a peak at z@xmath00.7 .",
    "the ukidss sub - sample is compared to those wigglez galaxies not matched to a nir source in figure [ fig : select2 ] .",
    "we find , as expected that the fraction of very blue galaxies detected in the nir is very low and increases as we go to redder colours .",
    "the ukidss detected galaxies are also brighter than those that are undetected .",
    "the median @xmath20-band magnitude of the ukidss detected galaxies is 21.0 versus 21.8 for the galaxies undetected in ukidss .",
    "the median @xmath17 colour is also 0.2 magnitudes redder for the ukidss detected galaxies .",
    "the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( _ wise _ ; @xcite ) has conducted an all - sky survey in four passbands - 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22@xmath4 m with 5@xmath3 depths of @xmath219.1 , @xmath218.8 , @xmath216.4 and @xmath214.5 . by its nature , _ wise _ contains many different populations of astrophysical sources including planetary debris disks , populations of cool low - mass stars and ultraluminous infrared galaxies and active galactic nuclei .",
    "although it is very shallow at 12 and 22@xmath4 m , the 3.4 and 4.6@xmath4 m depths are reasonably well - matched to the ukidss - las so it is interesting to ask what fraction of very blue star - forming galaxies such as the wigglez sample , are detected at these wavelengths in a relatively shallow all - sky ir survey .",
    "we match our sample of 39,701 wigglez galaxies at 0.3@xmath1z@xmath11.0 to the wise all - sky release using a matching radius of 4@xmath26 .",
    "the angular resolution at 3.4 and 4.6@xmath4 m is @xmath06@xmath26 . we select only those galaxies that are detected at s / n@xmath25 at 3.4@xmath4 m and s / n@xmath23 at 4.6@xmath4 m and have _ wise _ colours of [ 3.4@xmath274.6@xmath28<$]0.8 , consistent with these galaxies not having a significant agn component @xcite . at",
    "the _ wise _ wavelengths , the presence of an agn can significantly affect the galaxy colours and the sed fitting codes used in this work do not allow us to fit for this agn component .",
    "the median separation between the _ wise _ and wigglez sources is @xmath00.5@xmath26 and as expected , larger than that between the ukidss and wigglez sources .",
    "note that using a smaller matching radius of 2@xmath26 rather than 4@xmath26 , decreases the number of galaxies by only @xmath010% and does not affect any of our results .",
    "we use the _ wise _ magnitudes obtained from profile fitting as detailed in @xcite , which mitigates the effects of source confusion and source blending which can be significant at the typical fluxes of our sample . at the redshifts of the wigglez sample",
    ", we note that most of the galaxies appear unresolved in the _ wise _ images .",
    "more than 90% of the _ wise _ matches are also in ukidss",
    ". visual inspection of those that are not shows them to mostly be blended sources where two nearby sources that are resolved separately in the ukidss images , are blended together in _",
    "wise_. the remaining _ wise _ only identifications correspond to small patches of sky with no ukidss coverage .",
    "we therefore only restrict our _ wise _ sample to those sources that are also present in ukidss .",
    "the _ _ wise__+ukidss sub - sample contains 6117 galaxies at 0.3@xmath29 .",
    "their colour - magnitude distribution can also be seen in figure [ fig : select2 ] .",
    "the _ wise _ sample is brighter and slightly redder than the ukidss sample and corresponds to the brightest and reddest end of the wigglez population .",
    "the median @xmath20-band magnitude for the _ wise _ detected galaxies is 20.7 and these galaxies are 0.05 magnitudes redder on average than the ukidss detected galaxies .",
    "once again we find very little dependence of the matched fraction on the source redshift with the _ wise _ sample also peaking at z@xmath00.7 ."
