    "the main motivation for this work is a conjecture formulated by c. ward henson in the 1970s concerning geometric structure of non - separably categorical elementary classes of banach spaces .",
    "recently , after some partial progress had been made on henson s question , the second author suggested a formulation of the conjecture , which seemed within reach . in this paper , we prove a more general result .",
    "our techniques suggest the beginning of geometric structure theory for a larger class of _ stable _ elementary classes of banach spaces .",
    "we remind the reader that a class @xmath1 of banach spaces is called _ elementary _ if it is closed `` nicely '' under the ultra - product construction .",
    "more precisely , @xmath1 is elementary if it is closed under isometries , ultra - products and ultra - roots .",
    "it is widely understood that analyzing ultra - products and ultra - powers of a banach space can be very helpful ( and often essential ) for understanding its local structure .",
    "this suggests that it is natural to consider a banach space _ together with all its ultra - powers _  that is , even if one is only interested in a specific space , it can be instructive to look at the elementary class that it generates .",
    "hence elementary classes of banach spaces are interesting objects .",
    "equivalently , a class of banach spaces is elementary if it can be axiomatized in an appropriate logic .",
    "one can work with either henson s logic of positive bounded formulae @xcite or continuous first order logic @xcite .",
    "many `` natural '' classes of banach spaces are elementary , for example :    * fix @xmath2 .",
    "then the class of all banach spaces isometric to @xmath3 for some measure @xmath4 is elementary . *",
    "the class of all banach spaces whose dual is isometric to @xmath5 for some measure @xmath4 is elementary . *",
    "the class of all banach spaces isometric to @xmath6 for some compact hausdorff space @xmath1 is elementary . in this case",
    "the precise axiomatization is not known ( but it has been shown that this class is closed under ultra - products and ultra - roots ) .    an elementary class of banach spaces @xmath1 is called _ categorical _ in a cardinal @xmath7 if there is a unique @xmath8 of density character @xmath7 up to isometry .",
    "a class @xmath1 is called _ uncountably categorical _ , or _",
    "non - separably categorical _ , if it is categorical in some uncountable @xmath7 .",
    "the most basic example is the class of all banach spaces isometric to a hilbert space .",
    "there are other known examples , but in all of them the behavior of the class is `` controlled '' in a very strong sense by an underlined hilbert space .",
    "it is also surprisingly hard to find such examples , as well as to prove categoricity .",
    "the following has been shown recently by henson and raynaud :    [ exm : finitedim ] let @xmath9 any finite - dimensional banach space , and let @xmath10 be the class of all banach spaces which are isometric to the direct sum of an infinite dimensional hilbert space with @xmath9 . then @xmath10 is elementary and categorical in all infinite density characters .",
    "c. ward henson conjectured the following    ( henson ) let @xmath1 be an uncountably categorical elementary class of banach spaces . then    * @xmath1 is categorical in all uncountable cardinalities . *",
    "any @xmath11 of uncountable density character is `` very close '' to ( and `` determined by '' ) an underlined hilbert space .",
    "the first part of the conjecture is simply an analogue of a well - known o s conjecture in classical logic .",
    "it was established independently by the authors @xcite , and by ita ben yaacov @xcite .",
    "both proofs resembled classical proofs of analogous results in the first order context . in this paper",
    "we prove a version of the more interesting ( the second ) part of henson s conjecture .",
    "our main theorem is    [ main_theorem ] let @xmath1 be an uncountably categorical elementary class of banach spaces .",
    "then there is a separable @xmath12 and a minimal wide type @xmath13 over @xmath14 , such that    * any morley sequence in @xmath13 is isometric to the standard basis of a hilbert space . *",
    "any non - separable @xmath11 is prime over a morley sequence in @xmath13 ( which is a basis of a spreading model of @xmath14 ) .",
    "we explain all the necessary terms that appear in the statement later .",
    "in fact , our results are somewhat more general : we prove the theorem above for any elementary class of banach spaces expanded with continuous extra - structure ( we explain the different contexts we work in in section 2 ) .",
    "the following corollary , which is more accessible to the general audience , can be stated .",
    "[ main_theorem_ga ] let @xmath1 be an uncountably categorical elementary class of banach spaces .",
    "then any non - separable @xmath11 is prime over a sequence isometric to the standard basis of a hilbert space ( which is a spreading model of a fixed separable @xmath14 in @xmath1 ) .",
    "it should be remarked that theorem [ main_theorem_ga ] is significantly easier than theorem [ main_theorem ] : an attentive reader should be able to deduce it directly from dvoretzky - milman theorem ( fact [ dvoretzky ] ) and compactness ( the `` spreading model '' part requires techniques of basic stability , but is still straightforward ) .",
    "one of the main features of theorem [ main_theorem ] is that it gives a definable geometric object ( a wide type ) that generates the basis for the hilbert space that underlines any non - separable ( in fact , any `` large enough '' ) member of @xmath1 .",
    "one may ask whether stronger definability requirements hold : for example , whether the hilbert space itself may be assumed to be type - definable .",
    "this seems to be a hard and interesting question .",
    "let us explain some of the basic notions that appear in the statements above .",
    "a model @xmath11 is called _ prime _ over a set @xmath15 if whenever @xmath15 embeds into @xmath16 via @xmath17 , there is an embedding of @xmath18 into @xmath19 that extends @xmath20 .",
    "a model @xmath12 is called _ prime _ if it is prime over the empty set .",
    "note that all the embedding in this case are _",
    "we remind the reader that a sequence @xmath21 is called a _ spreading model _ of a banach space @xmath18 @xcite if it is 1-subsymmetric ( quantifier - free indiscernible ) , and there is a sequence @xmath22 in @xmath18 which is asymptotically isometric to @xmath21 : there exists a null sequence of positive reals @xmath23 such that whenever @xmath24 , we have    @xmath25    for every @xmath26 and @xmath27 $ ] .    clearly , since is 1-subsymmetric , the sum @xmath28 can be replaced with @xmath29 for every @xmath30 .",
    "equivalently , in model theoretic terms , a sequence @xmath21 is called a spreading model of @xmath18 if it is a quantifier free `` co - heir '' sequence over @xmath18 : that is , it is quantifier free indiscernible , and @xmath31 is finitely satisfiable in @xmath18 ( here `` @xmath32 '' stand for the quantifier free type in the pure language of normed spaces ) .",
    "so theorem [ main_theorem ] shows that every non - separable @xmath11 is essentially prime over a hilbert space , which is nicely based on a `` small '' separable `` base '' space . in example",
    "[ exm : finitedim ] the base space is the direct sum of @xmath9 with a separable hilbert space",
    ".    theorem [ main_theorem ] is proven in section [ conclusions ] , theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "although it was not clear to us until the proofs were basically finalized , a posteriori it has become transparent that this formulation of henson s conjecture , and the techniques developed on the way to its proof , provide in a sense a true analogue of geometric characterizations of uncountably categorical elementary classes in classical model theory , continuing the work of baldwin , lachlan , zilber and others ( which we discuss in the next subsection ) in the context of banach spaces .",
    "we believe that this paper lays the foundations for the developing of geometric stability in this setting .",
    "hence it is our hope that the results here are not of isolated interest , but rather a beginning of a new chapter in model theoretic study of banach spaces .",
    "henson s conjecture is strongly related to well - known results on classical uncountably categorical elementary classes . in 1962",
    "morley @xcite proved the conjecture of o which stated that a countable first order theory @xmath33 which is categorical in some uncountable power , is categorical in any uncountable power .",
    "basic examples of such theories are the theory of algebraically closed fields of a fixed characteristic , and the theory of vector spaces over a fixed field .",
    "morley s proof showed that an uncountably categorical theory @xmath33 admits a _ notion of independence _ and that any model of @xmath33 is both saturated ( `` rich '' ) and prime ( `` small '' ) over a basis with respect to this notion .",
    "less than ten years later baldwin and lachlan @xcite gave a different , more geometric proof of morley s theorem .",
    "they showed that every model of an uncountably categorical theory @xmath33 is determined by a `` strongly minimal '' definable set , on which the independence notion is of a very special kind : it is determined by algebraic closure .",
    "their proof also gave information about countable models of uncountably categorical theories .",
    "the results of baldwin and lachlan led to further research .",
    "specifically , zilber studied geometric structure of strongly minimal sets and showed that in many cases they are either `` field - like '' or `` group - like '' ( and in the `` field - like '' case one can interpret an algebraically closed field in the model ) .",
    "one reference for zilber s work is @xcite . a posteriori it turns out that henson s conjecture called for a similar analysis for banach spaces ( `` interpreting '' a hilbert space inside the model ) , but no appropriate tools were available until very recently . for example , no analogue of a strongly minimal set was known . in this article",
    ", we introduce new geometric objects , which we call _ wide types_. our thesis is that _ minimal wide types _ are the correct analogue of strongly minimal sets in this setting .",
    "another important notion that we are going to make use of is _",
    "stability_. in his proof , morley introduced the notion of _ @xmath34-stability_. he proved that an uncountably categorical theory is @xmath34-stable , and that @xmath34-stability implies several good properties , such as existence of prime models over any set ( we shall explain the notion of a prime model later ) and a `` nice '' notion of independence .",
    "later shelah defined the more general notion of _ stability _ and showed that any stable theory admits a similar notion of independence .",
    "stability was first introduced to functional analysis by krivine and maurey , who proved in @xcite that any stable banach spaces contains an almost isometric copy of @xmath35 for some @xmath36 .",
    "it was further investigated by iovino in @xcite and other works , and , more recently , by ben yaacov and the authors ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we have already pointed out that the first part of henson s conjecture states that the analogue of morley s theorem holds for classes of banach spaces .",
    "this was proven independently by the authors @xcite and ita ben yaacov @xcite .",
    "the two proofs are quite different , but none of them gives much geometric information . in some sense , both correspond to morley s original proof , and do not provide `` baldwin - lachlan analysis '' .",
    "we will use several results from @xcite in this article .",
    "in particular , we will use the fact that uncountable categoricity implies a topological version of @xmath34-stability , which has property similar to those of classical @xmath34-stability .",
    "consequently , uncountably categorical classes of banach spaces are stable",
    ".    we would also like to mention the classical theorem of macintyre @xcite : any @xmath34-stable field is algebraically closed . in a sense , this is a `` dual '' result to morley theorem : it shows that `` algebraic '' structure follows from model - theoretic properties .",
    "the second part of henson s conjecture has a similar flavor .",
    "we thank ward henson for numerous conversations that motivated and advanced this work .",
    "we also thank udi hrushovski for many helpful comments .",
    "in this section we describe the framework in which we are going to work . a reader who is familiar with continuous logic",
    "can easily skip to the last subsection ( subsection [ context ] ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite or @xcite for the definition of an ultra - product of banach spaces , and , more general , normed structures .    in subsection [ basic case ]",
    "we describe the very basic framework of quantifier free formulas in the pure language of banach spaces , which is enough for proving theorem [ main_theorem ] .",
    "the presentation in subsection [ basic case ] should be accessible to any mathematician , and very familiar to a functional analyst .",
    "for example , quantifier free types in this basic frameworks are precisely what krivine and maurey defined as `` types '' in @xcite .",

    "of course , this only makes sense if @xmath53 determines the value of @xmath54 .",
    "* we say that @xmath48 _ realizes _ a partial type @xmath51 if @xmath63 for every formula @xmath41 ( whose value is determined by @xmath53 ) .    the following version of compactness theorem can be found in e.g. @xcite .",
    "let @xmath45 be a banach space , @xmath51 a partial type in @xmath45 over @xmath15 .",
    "then there exists an ultra - power @xmath64 of @xmath45 and @xmath65 such that @xmath66 realizes @xmath53 .",
    "we call a banach space _ qf - saturated _ if for every @xmath15 of cardinality less than the density character of @xmath45 and every @xmath67 , @xmath36 is realized in @xmath45 .",
    "given an elementary class of banach spaces , we will assume the following :    _ there exists a banach space @xmath68 , which is qf - saturated , and whose cardinality is much bigger than all other cardinals discussed in this paper , and all @xmath69 , which are of interest to us , are subspaces of @xmath68_.    such @xmath68 is called the _ monster model _ of @xmath1 .",
    "there are slight set - theoretic assumptions which are involved in the existence of monster models , but we will not be concerned with these issues here .",
    "in fact , in the cases that we are interested in in this paper ( e.g. if @xmath1 is uncountably categorical , or just stable ) , no such assumptions are necessary .      in this subsection",
    "we give a very quick overview of continuous logic in the special case of normed structures .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite or @xcite for details .    just like in classical logic , a continuous _ signature _ consists of constant symbols , function symbols and predicate symbols .",
    "there is a special predicate symbol for the norm , @xmath70 .",
    "each function symbol and predicate symbol is equipped with its arity @xmath71 and its modulus of uniform continuity , which is a continuous function @xmath72 from @xmath73 to @xmath73 with @xmath74 .",
    "we will always assume that the signature contains the signature of a vector space over @xmath75 ; that is , it contains a constant symbol @xmath76 , a 2-ary function for vector addition , and for every @xmath77 , a 1-ary function @xmath78 for multiplication by @xmath79 .    a continuous _ pre - structure _",
    "@xmath45 for a given signature is a semi - normed space , in which all the constant symbols are interpreted as elements , function symbols - as functions on the structure , predicate symbols - as functions from the structure to @xmath80 .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath81 is a predicate symbol of arity @xmath82 , then its interpretation @xmath83 is a function @xmath84 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath20 is a function symbol of arity @xmath82 , then its interpretation @xmath85 is a function @xmath86 .",
    "moreover , we demand that the predicate @xmath70 is interpreted as a semi - norm on @xmath45 and all the predicates and functions are uniformly continuous with respect to @xmath70 , respecting their continuous moduli .",
    "this ensures that the predicates and functions are continuous uniformly over all structures . roughly speaking ,",
    "this is what is needed in order to make ultraproducts work .",
    "a _ structure _ is a pre - structure in which @xmath70 is a complete norm .",
    "one notion which is important to understand in order to read the paper in full generality is that of a _ formula_.",
    "the algebra of formulas is obtained as follows .",
    "an _ atomic _",
    "formula is an expression of the form @xmath87 where @xmath81 is a predicate symbol or arity @xmath82 , and every @xmath88 is a _ term _ , which is a `` generalized '' function symbol ( an expression that can be obtained by composing existing function symbols and applying them to variables and constants ) .",
    "for example , quantifier free formulas discussed in subsection [ basic case ] , which are expressions of the form @xmath89 , @xmath37 ( where @xmath90 is a constant ) or , more generally , @xmath91 ( where @xmath92 , @xmath93 are variables ) are atomic formulas . note that @xmath94 means @xmath95 , so we omit the formal function symbol and use the familiar notation .",
    "now the algebra of formulas is the closure of the collection of atomic formulas under `` connectives '' - bounded continuous function from @xmath96 ( for some @xmath97 ) , `` quantifiers '' @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( where @xmath38 is a variable ) and uniform limits .",
    "note that due to uniform limits we obtain formulas of the form @xmath100 where @xmath42 , and due to connectives we can for example speak of a formula @xmath101 or @xmath102 , where @xmath42 .",
    "using quantifiers , we get formulas of the form @xmath103 the collection of all formulas ( for a given signature ) is also called a _",
    "language_.    a ( closed ) _ condition _ is an expression of the form @xmath104 $ ] , where @xmath54 is a formula and @xmath105 is a closed subset of @xmath80",
    ". we will only work with conditions where @xmath105 is a closed interval , often a point ( most of the time @xmath106 ) .",
    "a variable in a formula @xmath54 is called _ bounded _ if it is in a scope of a quantifier , and it is called _ free _ if it is not bounded . given a formula @xmath54 with free variables",
    "@xmath107 , we often write @xmath108 in order to emphasize the free variables . it is easy to see that a formula @xmath109 and a structure @xmath45 , defines a function @xmath110 . in fact",
    ", @xmath111 is uniformly continuous , and , moreover , uniformly so in all structures ( one can calculate the uniform continuity modulus of @xmath54 , given the moduli of all function and predicate symbols in the signature ) .",
    "so given a formula @xmath109 , a structure @xmath45 , and @xmath112 , one can calculate @xmath113 . hence given a condition @xmath114 $ ] , a structure @xmath45 , and @xmath115",
    ", it makes to ask whether the condition is _ true _ in @xmath45 ( denoted by @xmath116 $ ] ) .",
    "if @xmath117 $ ] , we also say that @xmath45 is a _ model _ of ( for ) this condition .",
    "a _ theory _ is a collection of conditions with no free variables , which has a model .",
    "we normally assume that a theory @xmath33 is closed under entailment , that is , if a condition @xmath118 $ ] follows from @xmath33 ( which means that it is true in all models of @xmath33 ) , then @xmath118 \\in t$ ] .",
    "compactness theorem ( see @xcite ) states that a collection of conditions has a model if and only if every finite subset of it does .",
    "a theory is called _ complete _ if for every condition @xmath118 $ ] either it is in @xmath33 or for some closed @xmath119 disjoint to @xmath105 we have @xmath120\\in t$ ] .",
    "equivalently , @xmath33 is complete if it `` forces '' a value for every formula @xmath54 with no free variables , that is ,",
    "@xmath121 \\in t$ ] for some @xmath42 .",
    "we will denote that value by @xmath122 .",
    "note that every theory can be extended to a complete theory ( in fact , every model @xmath45 of @xmath33 determines a complete theory ) .",
    "we will normally assume that we have a fixed complete theory in the background , and all structures are models of @xmath33 ; we will therefore often simply call them `` models '' . given a model @xmath45 , and a subset @xmath15 of @xmath45",
    ", we will often expand the language by adding constant symbols for all elements of @xmath15 . call this language @xmath123 .",
    "then @xmath45 naturally becomes an @xmath123-structure ; we will call @xmath123-formulas `` formulas over @xmath15 '' .",
    "the next definition is of central importance .",
    "@xmath51 in a model @xmath45 over a set @xmath15 is a collection of conditions of the form @xmath124 $ ] ( where @xmath54 is a formula over @xmath15 , @xmath125 ) , which is finitely approximately satisfiable in @xmath45 .",
    "the latter means that for every finite subset @xmath126 of @xmath51 and for every @xmath127 there exists @xmath128 such that @xmath129 $ ] for every condition @xmath124 $ ] in @xmath126 .",

    "note that in general @xmath38 in the definition of the type does not need to be a singleton ( so neither does @xmath90 , that is , maybe @xmath133 for some @xmath97 ) , although in this paper it we will normally work with formulas and types in one variable .",
    "we say that a type @xmath51 _ determines _ a value of a formula @xmath41 if @xmath49 \\in \\pi$ ] for some @xmath42 .",
    "complete _ type over @xmath15 is a type over @xmath15 which determines a value for every formula over @xmath15 ( with the right number of variables ) .",

    "note the correspondence between complete theories and complete types ( a complete type can be viewed as a complete theory in a certain language ) .",
    "we denote the space of all complete type over a set @xmath15 in @xmath134 variables by @xmath135 .",
    "this is a compact hausdorff topological space , but we will not be concerned with this fact here .",
    "let @xmath136 .",
    "note that the space of types is relative to a certain model which contains @xmath15 ; but as we ll see in a bit , we will be working in one big model of the theory @xmath33 ( the `` monster '' model ) , and all types will be computed in that structure .    given a model @xmath45 , a set @xmath15 and a tuple @xmath133 , we denote by @xmath137 the collection of all closed conditions over @xmath15 that @xmath90 satisfies .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath138 , and we call it the type of @xmath90 over @xmath15 ( again , we forget to mention @xmath45 ) .",
    "conversely , every complete type over a set @xmath15 is the type of some @xmath90 over @xmath15 ( possibly @xmath90 is in some ultrapower of @xmath45 ; soon this wo nt matter because in the `` monster '' model we will have realizations for all types over `` small '' sets ) .    given a cardinal @xmath7 , a model @xmath45",
    "is called @xmath7-saturated if every type over a subset of @xmath45 of cardinality less than @xmath7 is realized in @xmath45 .",
    "a model is called _ saturated _ if it is @xmath139-saturated .",
    "there is a mild set - theoretic assumption that goes into the existence of saturated model , and it can be avoided if one works with a slightly weaker notion than saturation ( which has the same properties that we care about ) , but we will not go into the details here . as a matter of fact , in the cases that we will be interested in in this paper ( e.g. @xmath33 uncountably categorical , or just stable ) , saturated model provably exist . given a ( complete ) theory @xmath33 , we will assume the following :    _ there exists a saturated model @xmath68 of cardinality @xmath140 for some big enough cardinal @xmath140 , that is , much bigger than all cardinals mentioned in this paper ( except @xmath140 itself , of course ) .",
