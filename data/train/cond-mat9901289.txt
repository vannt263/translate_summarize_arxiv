    "the most fundamental problem in solid - state physics is to understand why elements ( and most compounds ) crystallize in ordered periodic structures , for this forms the basis of all of solid - state physics .",
    "while it is well known that the driving principle behind this ordering is a lowering of the ground - state energy of the material , and there has been significant progress with _ ab initio _ methods to predict the ground - state properties of these ordered phases in real materials , there still are no exactly solvable models for crystal formation that describe the statistical - mechanical mechanism behind the ordering of the electrons and ions on a periodic lattice .",
    "furthermore , it is not understood what the physical mechanisms are that are necessary for creating a crystallized state .",
    "this crystallization problem is ubiquitous ; it also describes the statistical mechanics behind binary - alloy formation or phase separation since the two problems can be mapped onto each other ( as described below ) , and it may also describe the physics behind charge - stripe formation in the cuprates .",
    "it may sound surprising that no solvable statistical - mechanical model for crystallization exists , since a statistical - mechanical model for magnetic order has been known ever since onsager solved the two - dimensional ising model@xcite .",
    "onsager s solution produced a paradigm for understanding phase transitions in many different physical systems and provided a textbook example of much of the theory behind modern critical phenomena .",
    "in fact , lee and yang@xcite modified the ising model to consider the magnetic order in an external magnetic field , and mapped the problem onto a lattice gas , where the up spins denoted sites occupied by ions , and the down spins denoted empty sites .",
    "onsager s method of solution does not extend to the case of a finite magnetic field , so no exact results are known for the lattice gas , except in the case where the number of ions equals one half the number of lattice sites , which corresponds to the zero - field case .",
    "these models of crystallization neglect the electronic degrees of freedom of the valence electrons , and hence are not directly applicable to real materials such as metals and alloys .",
    "it turns out that the ising model , and many other models for magnetism , simplify when they are examined in high dimensions .",
    "in fact , the ising model is solved by a static mean field theory in four and higher dimensions .",
    "a similar situation is expected for electronic problems , except they remain nontrivial even in the infinite - dimensional limit@xcite .",
    "metzner and vollhardt showed that the electronic problem requires a dynamical mean - field theory for its solution in infinite dimensions .",
    "furthermore , a wide range of evidence indicates that this dynamical mean - field theory provides a quantitative approximation to the solutions of correlated electron problems in three dimensions ( at least if one is not too close to a critical point ) .",
    "in fact , it is precisely the nonuniversal properties ( such as a transition temperature ) that the dynamical mean - field theory determines accurately , and it s solution provides a wealth of information on the qualitative behavior of the model studied .",
    "we employ the dynamical mean - field theory here to produce an exact solution of the crystallization problem which includes the electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the simplest model that can describe crystallization and include electronic degrees of freedom is the spinless falicov - kimball model@xcite which consists of two kinds of particles : localized ions and itinerant ( spinless ) electrons .",
    "the localized ions ( @xmath0 or 1 ) occupy sites on a lattice in real space with an energy @xmath1 , and the electrons can hop ( with a hopping integral @xmath2 $ ] ) between neighboring lattice sites . in addition , there is a screened coulomb interaction @xmath3 between electrons and ions that occupy the same lattice site . since the electrons do not interact with each other , the `` spin '' degree of freedom is unimportant , and is neglected .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath4 with @xmath5 @xmath6 the creation ( annihilation ) operator for electrons at site @xmath7 , and @xmath8 denoting the ion occupancy at site @xmath7 .",
    "we use @xmath9 as the energy scale .",
    "the falicov - kimball model can be viewed as a simplified approximation to a real material in a variety of ways .",
    "if the material has a single valence electron , and only one electronic band lies near the fermi level , then the crystallization problem would correspond to the case where the electron and ion concentrations ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) are the same ( which is called the neutral case ) , since one electron is donated by each ion .",
    "if , instead , there are many bands near the fermi level , then one can map the combined bands into a single `` effective '' band which will have an electron filling determined by the average filling of the electrons in the most important band . in this case , each ion may donate only a fraction of an electron to the crystal , because the rest of the electron goes into other hybridized bands that lie close to the fermi level .",
    "hence , one may find it useful to also consider nonneutral cases for the crystallization problem , where the electron and ion concentrations are not equal .",
    "this model can also be mapped onto the binary alloy problem , where a site occupied by an ion is mapped to a site occupied by an @xmath12 ion and a site unoccupied by an ion is mapped to a site occupied by a @xmath13 ion , and the screened coulomb interaction is mapped to the difference in the site energies for electrons on an @xmath12 ion versus on a @xmath13 ion .",
    "as it stands , the falicov - kimball model does nt appear to be a many - body problem at all , since the ions are localized and do not move , which implies that the quantum - mechanical problem for the electrons can be solved by diagonalizing a single - particle problem of an electron moving in the potential determined by the given configuration of the ions @xmath14 .",
    "the many - body problem aspects enter by taking an annealed average over all possible ion configurations with the chosen ion concentration .",
    "this produces long - range interactions between the ions , that can cause them to order or phase separate at low temperatures .",
    "much is already known about the physics of the falicov - kimball model ( as reviewed by gruber and macris@xcite ) . in the neutral case where each particle concentration equals 1/2 ,",
    "lieb and kennedy @xcite and brandt and schmidt @xcite proved that the system always orders in an alternating `` chessboard '' phase at a finite transition temperature in all dimensions greater than 1 .",
    "this ordered phase can be interpreted as the transition from a high - temperature homogeneous ( liquid / gas ) phase to a low - temperature ordered ( solid ) phase .",
    "the appearance of a low - temperature ordered phase follows as a consequence of the pauli exclusion principle , since lieb and kennedy also showed that if the itinerant particles were bosons instead of electrons , they would clump together and not form a periodically ordered ground state .",
    "the falicov - kimball model is expected to be in the same universality class as the ising model , but , because of the electronic degrees of freedom , one needs to solve the full statistical model to determine the `` effective magnetic exchange parameters '' between different lattice sites .",
    "the parameters can be extracted in a systematic expansion if the electronic kinetic energy ( the hopping term ) is taken as a perturbation,@xcite but such an analysis is only valid in the strong - coupling regime , and rapidly becomes problematic .",
    "_ it is precisely this complication that has frustrated attempts at finding an exact solution to the crystallization problem when electronic degrees of freedom are introduced .",
    "_    the one - dimensional limit of the falicov - kimball model has also been extensively studied .",
    "here there are no finite - temperature phase transitions , but the system can have phase transitions in the ground state .",
    "the first attempt at studying the one - dimensional falicov - kimball model proceeded along the lines of _ ab initio _ band - structure calculations for real materials  a small number of candidate ion configurations were chosen for the ground state , and a restricted phase diagram was determined for all structures within the subset @xcite .",
    "the numerical solutions produced two conjectures : the first was a result for the case where @xmath15 , which stated that if the screened coulomb interaction @xmath3 was large enough , then the system would segregate into an empty lattice ( with no ions and all the electrons ) , and a full lattice ( with all the ions and no electrons ) .",
    "the second was a generalization of the peierls instability , which says that in the small @xmath3 limit the system will order in such a fashion that the ions produce a band structure that has a maximal gap at the fermi level .",
    "this first conjecture ( the segregation principle ) was later proven to be true by lemberger @xcite while the second conjecture was shown to be false if the electron concentration was sufficiently far from half - filling . in that case",
    ", the system would phase separate between the empty lattice , and an optimally chosen ion structure that had the fermi level lying in the gap @xcite .",
    "the other limit that has been extensively studied is the large - dimensional limit where brandt and mielsch @xcite provided the solution of the transition temperature as a function of @xmath3 for the half - filled symmetric case .",
    "their solution involves solving a coupled set of transcendental equations which display first and second - order phase transitions .",
    "freericks @xcite later showed that the model ( on a hypercubic lattice ) also displayed incommensurate order and segregation .",
    "there are two kinds of lattices that are usually investigated in the large coordination - number limit : the hypercubic lattice , which is the generalization of the cubic lattice to large dimensions ; and the bethe lattice , which is a thermodynamic limit of the cayley tree when the number of nearest neighbors becomes large .",
    "the noninteracting band structure for the hypercubic lattice produces a density of states that is a gaussian [ @xmath16 $ ] , while on the bethe lattice the density of states is wigner s semicircle @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "the hypercubic density of states has an infinite bandwidth , but most of the weight lies within a range of @xmath18 about the origin .",
    "the bethe lattice density of states has the same behavior as a three - dimensional system at the band edge ( square - root behavior ) but has no van hove singularities in the interior of the band . because both density of states are nontrivial",
    ", the many - body problem maintains much of it s rich behavior that arises from the competition between kinetic - energy effects and interaction - energy effects .",
    "in particular , the falicov - kimball model continues to have phase transitions in the large coordination number limit , but the transitions have mean - field theory exponents .    in this contribution",
    ", we examine what happens in the case when the coulomb interaction becomes infinite @xmath19 ( the attractive case is equivalent to this case through a particle - hole transformation of the electrons , which carries @xmath20 . in this case , the electrons avoid the sites of the lattice occupied by the ions , so the electron concentration varies from zero up to @xmath21 .",
    "we investigated the non - unit - density cases , where the electron concentration was restricted to @xmath22 . in section",
    "ii the formalism and results for calculations on the bethe lattice are presented . in section iii , results for the hypercubic lattice are given and in section iv we present our conclusions .",
    "in the thermodynamic limit , the local lattice green s function is defined to be @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the fermionic matsubara frequency , @xmath25 is the inverse temperature , @xmath26 is the electron chemical potential , and @xmath27 denotes @xmath28-ordering .",
    "the angle brackets in eq .",
    "( [ eq : greendef ] ) denote the sum over ionic configurations .",
    "the local green s function is determined by mapping onto an atomic problem in a time - dependent field , with the following action @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the ion number for the atomic site and @xmath31 is the mean - field or effective - medium green s function , which is determined self - consistently ( as described below ) . the atomic green s function , with the action in eq .",

    "the self - consistency relation is that the self - energy @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : greenlocal ] ) must coincide with the self - energy of the atomic problem , i.  e. @xmath37 equations ( [ eq : greenatomic ] ) , ( [ eq : greenlocal ] ) , and ( [ eq : sigmadyson ] ) constitute the mean - field theory for homogeneous phases . in the limit",
    "@xmath38 eq .  ( [ eq : sigmadyson ] ) is an exact equation for the lattice problem .",

    "these equations are complicated to solve analytically but a simplification occurs for @xmath39 in the limit @xmath19 .",

    "we were able to explicitly show that phase separation precluded incommensurate ( or commensurate ) charge - density - wave order for the hypercubic lattice .",

    "it is possible that the phenomena described here incorporates the relevant physics of the charge - stripe phases in the cuprate materials : that the stripes occurred because of the strong propensity towards phase separation in the strongly correlated limit .",
    "the analogy would stem from considering the down spin electrons of the hubbard model to be frozen in a particular configuration , and then examine how the mobile up spin electrons react to the down spins .",
    "the quantum fluctuations of the hubbard model are replaced by the thermal fluctuations of the falicov - kimball model , and it can be viewed as a simplifying approximation to the charge dynamics of the strongly correlated hubbard model , but not incorporating the spin dynamics . in this case , as postulated by emery and kivelson,@xcite the stripes would form from a balance between the desire for the system to phase separate , and the long - range coulomb interaction , which would prevent the electrons from completely separating from the ions .",
    "there is evidence for alternative points of view , however .",
    "white and collaborators@xcite have shown that the hubbard model on a ladder displays charge - stripe order even without the long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "this order arises from the correlation of the spins and the holes and a desire to reduce the frustration induced by the hole motion . in their picture",
    ", the stripe ordering arises completely from a model that includes no long - range forces .",
    "nevertheless , it is our belief that the phase separation exhibited here will be an important element of a complete description of the charge - stripe order in the cuprates and nickelates , because it must occur if @xmath3 becomes large enough .",
