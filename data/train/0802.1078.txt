    "the supercurrent through a quantum dot has been measured through dots realized in carbon nanotubes @xcite and in inas nanowires.@xcite recently , transport measurements on a single self - assembled inas quantum dot coupled to al superconducting electrodes have been reported.@xcite    from a theoretical point of view , quantum dots coupled to superconducting leads are of great interest , since a very rich physics is expected from the combination of superconducting correlations , electron - electron interaction and non - equilibrium in the dot .",
    "subgap transport through a normal - dot - superconductor system is sustained by andreev reflection.@xcite the josephson coupling between two superconductors through a quantum dot has been addressed in the limit of a non - interacting quantum dot in ref .  .",
    "in the opposite limit of a large charging energy , the electrons forming a cooper pair tunnel one by one via virtual dot states,@xcite which establishes a josephson current carried by higher - order tunneling processes .",
    "other aspects of the problem , such as the kondo regime @xcite or multiple andreev reflection @xcite have also been addressed .",
    "the dependence of the charge in the quantum dot on the gate voltage and on the superconducting phase difference has been investigated in ref .  .",
    "moreover , numerical approaches based on the non - crossing approximation , @xcite the numerical renormalization group @xcite and monte carlo @xcite have been employed to study transport through this type of systems .",
    "the authors of ref .   compare different approximation schemes , such as mean field and second - order perturbation in the coulomb interaction .",
    "the proximity effect in double - dot systems has been also investigated in different regimes .",

    "the non - equilibrium josephson and andreev currents through a dot coupled to one normal and two superconducting leads have been studied in the weak - proximity limit , considering only first - order processes in the tunnel coupling with the superconductors . in this regime , finite josephson and andreev currents can flow only if the dot is driven out of equilibrium .",
    "the idea of using non - equilibrium to control the behavior of a josephson junction has been proposed@xcite and experimentally tested@xcite some years ago .    in the present work , we develop a real - time transport theory for an interacting quantum dot connected to both superconducting and normal leads .",
    "the theory can be conveniently formulated by means of a diagrammatic language and it is suitable for dealing with superconducting correlations , strong coulomb interaction and non - equilibrium due to arbitrary bias voltages on the same footing .",
    "we demonstrate the use of our formalism for two examples .",
    "first , we study the equilibrium josephson current between two superconductors due to cotunneling through the quantum dot and analyze the formation of a @xmath0-state for increasing on - site coulomb repulsion on the dot .",
    "second , we consider a transistor geometry with one normal and two superconducting leads with large superconducting gaps .",
    "we calculate the non - equilibrium josephson and andreev current to all orders in the coupling strength with the superconductors , where the quantum dot is driven out of equilibrium by applying a bias voltage to the normal lead .",
    "this geometry is suitable for performing a spectroscopy of the andreev bound states in the interacting quantum dot .",
    "we consider a single - level quantum dot tunnel coupled to both normal and superconducting leads .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath1 the different ( superconducting or normal ) leads are labeled by the index @xmath2 .",
    "the quantum dot is described by the hamiltonian of the single - level anderson model , @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator for an electron in the dot , @xmath6 denotes the energy of the single - particle level , @xmath7 is the number operator for spin @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the energy cost for double occupation .",
    "the leads electrons are described by the annihilation and creation operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "in addition to the kinetic - energy term @xmath12 in the hamiltonian , there may be a bcs pair - interaction part @xmath13 to account for superconductivity .",
    "on the one hand , we want to treat the interaction on a mean - field level . on the other hand",
    ", we want to keep track of the total number of electrons , which will be important for situations with finite bias voltage between different superconductors .",
    "this can be achieved by representing the lead electrons in terms of bogoliubov quasiparticle operators @xmath14 and cooper - pair annihilation ( creation ) operators  @xcite @xmath15 via the bogoliubov transform @xmath16 with coefficients @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the electrochemical potential of lead @xmath2 and @xmath19 the phase of the order parameter @xmath20 . as a result",
    ", the mean - field hamiltonian for lead @xmath2 reads @xmath21 plus an irrelevant constant . here , @xmath22 is the quasiparticle energy , and @xmath23 is the total number of electrons , which equals the number of bogoliubov quasiparticles plus twice the number of cooper pairs . in the case",
    "that @xmath2 refers to a normal lead , the order parameter vanishes , @xmath24 .",
    "the coupling between the dot and the leads is taken into account by the tunneling hamiltonians @xmath25 where for the sake of simplicity the tunnel matrix elements @xmath26 are considered to be spin and wavevector independent .",
    "the tunnel - coupling strengths are defined as @xmath27 , which we assume to be energy independent .",
    "the main idea of the diagrammatic real - time technique is to integrate out all the ( noninteracting ) fermionic degrees of freedom in the leads to arrive at an effective description for the reduced system , that is characterized by the state of the quantum dot and the number of cooper pairs in the superconducting leads .",
    "the hilbert space of the single - level quantum dot is four dimensional : the dot can be empty , singly occupied with a spin - up or spin - down electron , or doubly occupied .",
    "these are denoted by @xmath28 , and have energies @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the condensates in the superconducting leads are characterized by the number of cooper pairs @xmath32 , relative to some arbitrarily chosen reference , where @xmath33 is the vector of cooper - pair numbers @xmath34 for each superconducting lead @xmath2 . the energy contribution from the cooper - pair condensates",
    "is given by @xmath35 .",
    "if all superconducting leads are kept at the same chemical potential then this energy contribution simply provides a trivial additive constant . for finite bias voltage between at least two superconducting",
    "leads , however , the total energy depends on how the cooper pairs are distributed among the superconducting leads .",
    "we start with the full density matrix of the total system , including the quantum dot , the fermionic degrees of freedom of the leads , and the cooper - pair condensates .",
    "since the fermionic degrees of freedom in the leads act as reservoirs , we can trace them out to obtain the reduced density matrix @xmath36 with matrix elements @xmath37 .",
    "here , the label @xmath38 with energy @xmath39 includes both the quantum - dot state @xmath40 and the number of cooper pairs , @xmath33 , in the leads . for the diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix we also use the notation @xmath41 .",
    "the dynamics of the reduced density matrix is governed by the kinetic or generalized master equation , @xmath42 where the kernels @xmath43 describe transitions due to tunneling .",
    "the current in lead @xmath2 can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the sum of all kernels that describe transitions in which in total @xmath47 electrons are removed from lead @xmath2 .",
    "both the generalized master equation and the expression for the current can be further simplified when all voltages and coupling strengths are kept time independent .",
    "the kernels do , then , only depend on the time difference @xmath48 , and to determine the dc component of the current and all density matrix elements we only need the time integrals of the kernels , which we refer to as generalized rates @xmath49 and generalized current rates @xmath50 .",
    "the indices @xmath51 contain more information than needed for our purpose .",
    "this is related to the fact that only the change and not the absolute value of the number of cooper pairs in each superconducting lead matters , i.e. the value of the generalized rate @xmath52 does not change when we perform the simultaneous shift @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 for a given vector of additional cooper - pair numbers @xmath57 . after defining @xmath58 and similarly for the generalized current rates , we obtain for the stationary current in lead @xmath2 @xmath59 where the matrix elements @xmath60 are determined from @xmath61 together with the normalization condition @xmath62 .",
    "note that , in eqs .",
    "( [ current_n ] ) and ( [ master_n ] ) , due to conservation of the total number of electrons , only those cooper - pair - number vectors @xmath33 appear for which @xmath63 equals twice the number of dot electrons in state @xmath64 minus that in state @xmath65 ( and the same holds true for @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 ) .",
    "the generalized master equations for @xmath69 with all other vectors @xmath33 , not satisfying the condition stated above , decouple and are , therefore , irrelevant .",
    "for illustration , let us consider the matrix element @xmath70 in a system with two superconducting leads ; for example , with @xmath71 or @xmath72 it contributes , while with @xmath73 it is irrelevant .    in the special case that all superconducting leads are at the same chemical potential @xmath74",
    ", the situation simplifies further . due to the fact that in eq .",
    "( [ master_n ] ) the energy contribution @xmath75 is the same for all @xmath33 that are compatible with @xmath65 and @xmath64 , the generalized master equation eq .",
    "( [ master_n ] ) remains unchanged under the shift @xmath76 and @xmath77 with @xmath78 . as a consequence ,",
    "the generalized rates @xmath79 and @xmath80 as well as the solution for @xmath81 become independent of the cooper - pair numbers , i.e. , we can simply drop the arguments @xmath82 , @xmath33 and @xmath66 .",
    "it is this limit that we are going to analyze in the results section of this paper .",
    "we generalize the real - time diagrammatic approach to transport through interacting quantum dots of ref .   to the case of superconducting",
    "our goal is to give a diagrammatic prescription to compute the generalized rates @xmath83 and @xmath84 . for this",
    ", we analyze the time evolution of the reduced density matrix that we obtain by integrating out the fermionic degrees of freedom in the leads .",
    "we assume at some initial time @xmath85 ( with @xmath86 ) the total system to be in a product state of the leads fermionic degrees of freedom ( taken at equilibrium ) and the degrees of freedom of the reduced system .",
    "the time evolution of the reduced density matrix from time @xmath85 to time @xmath87 can , then , be described by @xmath88 . the propagator @xmath89 can be computed by means of a perturbation expansion in the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath90 .",
    "how this is done has been explained elsewhere@xcite and here we will limit ourselves to sketch briefly the derivation , thereby pointing out the new ingredients due to superconductivity .",
    "the propagator ( starting from and ending at a product state of the leads fermions and the reduced system ) is written in interaction representation with respect to @xmath91 as    @xmath92       |\\xi_1 ' ( t')\\rangle\\right\\},\\ ] ]    being @xmath93 the keldysh contour going from @xmath94 to @xmath87 and then backwards to @xmath94 , @xmath95 the time - ordering operator on the keldysh contour , @xmath96 the tunnel hamiltonian in interaction representation , and @xmath97 the trace over the fermionic part of the lead degrees of freedom .",
    "next , we expand the exponential function in a power series of @xmath91 . finally , we perform the trace over the fermionic lead degrees of freedom by means of wick s theorem .",
    "this is possible because the hamiltonians of the leads are quadratic in the lead fermionic operators ( this applies also to the superconductors in the mean - field description adopted here ) .    for normal leads ,",
    "only contractions between electron creation and annihilation operators are non zero .",
    "they are graphically depicted as tunneling lines ( _ normal lines _ ) with an arrow going from the vertex @xmath98 to the vertex @xmath99 .",
    "we define the direction of the line such that an electron is removed from the dot at the vertex where the line starts and added to the dot at the vertex where the line ends .",
    "for the superconducting leads two different types of lines appear .",
    "there are again _ normal lines _",
    ", connecting a vertex @xmath98 with the @xmath99 .",
    "in addition , there are _ anomalous lines _ , connecting either @xmath98 with @xmath100 , or @xmath101 with @xmath102 . due to the convention for the arrow direction introduced above ,",
    "the anomalous lines carry two arrows that point towards each other ( _ outgoing anomalous line _ ) if two annihilation operators of dot electrons are involved , and away from each other ( _ incoming anomalous line _ ) for two creation operators of dot electrons .",
    "to evaluate the contractions , it is convenient to perform the bogoliubov transform for the lead electron operators . since the bogoliubov transform involves the operators @xmath15 , the number of cooper pairs in lead @xmath2 may be changed at the tunnel vertices . for each normal and each anomalous superconducting line , there are two possibilities . the vertices being connected by normal lines",
    "either involve no operator @xmath15 or one @xmath103 and one @xmath104 . for outgoing ( incoming ) anomalous lines ,",
    "either one of the two vertices carries the operator @xmath104 ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "the normal lines describe quasiparticle tunneling . whereas , the anomalous lines describe andreev tunneling : for an incoming ( outgoing ) anomalous line a cooper pair breaks ( forms ) in the lead and its constituents enter ( leave ) the dot at the two vertices .",
    "now we can describe the different contributions to the propagator by means of a graphical representation on the keldysh contour .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ prop ] , where both normal and anomalous lines are present .",
    "the propagator obeys the dyson equation    @xmath105    where @xmath106 is the free propagator and we identify @xmath107 with the irreducible part of the propagator , i.e. with the sum of irreducible diagrams going from @xmath108 to @xmath87 contributing to the propagator @xmath109 , where a diagram is irreducible if any vertical line through the diagrams cuts at least one tunneling line .",
    "the order in @xmath110 of an irreducible diagram is given by the number of tunneling lines present in the diagram .",
    "examples of first- and second - order diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ prop ] .    from now on we concentrate on stationary situations and , hence , we will consider the generalized rates .",
    "these are given by the laplace transform of @xmath111 computed at @xmath112 , i.e @xmath113_{z=0^{+}}$ ] .",
    "furthermore , we only keep the information of cooper - pair - number differences , i.e. , we formulate the rules for @xmath114 .",
    "the last step does not only reduce the number of matrix elements to be considered .",
    "another virtue is the possibility to combine different contributions .",
    "as mentioned above , for a given superconducting line there are always two possibilities to assign operators @xmath15 to the two vertices . depending on the topology of the reduced diagram",
    ", the corresponding terms may contribute to _ different _ generalized rates @xmath52 ( that differ from each other by the number of cooper pairs ) but they always contribute to the _ same _ @xmath115 .",
    "it turns out that , since the tunneling strengths @xmath116 are independent of energy , the analytic expressions of the two contributions always combine nicely , which leads to a rather compact formulation of the diagrammatic rules presented below .",
    "as defined above , the arrows of a tunneling line indicate whether an electron enters or leaves the dot at a given tunnel vertex .",
    "furthermore , we want to define an overall direction of each tunneling in order to define the sign of the energy carried by the bogoliubov quasiparticles . for normal lines , we will always choose the direction set by the single arrow .",
    "for anomalous lines ( that carry two opposite arrows ) , we pick the direction arbitrarily , and assign the creation or annihilation of a cooper pair to the vertex at which the line direction is opposite to the arrow .    in order to construct a systematic perturbation expansion in the tunnel coupling , both the generalized rates and the probabilities are expanded in orders of @xmath110 , i.e @xmath117 and @xmath118 , where the superscript indicates the order in @xmath110 .     of the propagator for the reduced density matrix , for the exemplary case of one superconductor with chemical potential @xmath74 .",
    "the upper and the lower line of the keldysh contour represents the forward and the backward propagation , respectively . from left to the right we can identify a first - order diagram with a normal line , a first - order diagram with an anomalous line , a second - order diagram with a normal and an anomalous lines . below the diagrammatic representation of the propagator , we show our arbitrary choice for the directions of the anomalous lines and the corresponding energy differences to be used in rule 2 , which are given by @xmath119 ; @xmath120 ; @xmath121 ; @xmath122 ; @xmath123 . ]      the rules for evaluating the generalized rates @xmath115 are :    1 .",

    "the tunneling lines can be normal or anomalous .",
    "for each anomalous line choose the direction ( forward or backward with respect to the keldysh contour ) arbitrarily .",
    "2 .   for each vertical cut between two vertices assign a factor @xmath125 with @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the difference between the left - going and the right - going energies , including the energy of the dot states , @xmath128 , the tunneling lines , @xmath124 , and the energy difference of cooper - pair condensates , @xmath129 .",
    "the latter is increased ( decreased ) at each vertex of an outgoing ( incoming ) anomalous line at which the arrow is opposite to the arbitrarily chosen line direction .",

    "+ 5 .   for each diagram , integrate over all energies @xmath124 .",
    "sum over all diagrams .",
    "the generalized current rates @xmath141 are evaluated in the following way :    1 .",
    "multiply the value of the corresponding generalized rate @xmath142 with a factor given by adding up the following numbers for each tunneling line that is associated with lead @xmath2 : + a ) for normal lines : @xmath143 if the line is going from the lower to the upper , @xmath138 if it is going from the upper to the lower propagator , and @xmath144 otherwise ; + b ) for anomalous lines : @xmath143 for incoming lines within the upper and outgoing lines within the lower propagator , @xmath138 for for outgoing lines within the upper and incoming lines within the lower propagator , and @xmath144 otherwise .",
    "the diagrammatic rules are formulated generally enough to account for any choice of chemical potentials of the leads , i.e. , we allow for any bias voltages between any pair of leads .",
    "a variety of interesting phenomena , however , shows up already when all superconducting leads are kept at the same chemical potential ( set to 0 per definition ) , and a nonequilibrium situation is generated only by applying voltages between the normal leads and the superconductors .",
    "it is this limit that we are going to analyze in the rest of the paper . in this case",
    ", the diagrammatic language simplifies further .",
    "as already indicated above , we simply can drop all information associated with the cooper - pair numbers in our diagrammatic rules .",
    "if all superconducting leads are kept at the same chemical potential , which we put to @xmath144 per definition , we can use the simplified diagram , where the information about the cooper pairs is ignored .",
    "such a procedure is identical to having dropped the cooper - pair states from the very beginning in the hamiltonian , i.e. , using the bogoliubov transform without employing the operators @xmath15 . for this case , the charge current in lead @xmath2 has been related to the local green s functions of the quantum dot  @xcite by using the approach of ref .  . here , we report the formula of ref .   which is useful for what comes in the following .",
