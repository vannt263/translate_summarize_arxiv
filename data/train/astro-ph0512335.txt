    "direct detections of very faint exoplanets and brown dwarfs near bright stars are essential to understand substellar formation and evolution around stars .",
    "this endeavor is now one of the major goals for next generation 10-m telescope instruments and future 30- to 100-m telescopes .",
    "the task is dauntingly difficult .",
    "the exoplanet or brown dwarf image is usually much fainter than the background from the brilliant stellar point spread function ( psf ) image . besides the poisson noise ,",
    "ground - based telescopes suffer from atmospheric turbulence that produces random short - lived speckles that mask faint companions .",
    "if these two limitations were the only ones , a simple solution would be to integrate longer to average these random noises and gain as the square root of the integration time . but observations have shown that , for integrations longer than a few minutes , the psf noise converges to a quasi - static noise pattern , thus preventing a gain with increasing integration time @xcite . to achieve better detection limits ,",
    "it is thus necessary to subtract the quasi - static noise using a reference psf .",
    "both ground- and space - based imaging are plagued with this stellar psf calibration problem caused by imperfect optics and slowly evolving optical alignments . for ground - based imaging , subtraction of a reference psf obtained from a star close to the target",
    "achieves a factor @xmath4 of psf noise attenuation , leaving residuals that are also quasi - static and thus severely limiting detection of fainter companions @xcite . for space telescopes that have a better psf stability , like hst ,",
    "a partial solution was found by subtracting two stellar images acquired during the same orbit with a different roll angle .",
    "this technique , called `` roll deconvolution '' , successfully subtracts the stellar image by a factor 50 @xcite but is also ultimately limited by psf evolution .",
    "a similar technique , called angular differential imaging ( adi ) , can be used on ground - based altitude / azimuth telescopes to subtract a significant fraction of the stellar quasi - static noise and can potentially achieve detection limits that improve as the square root of the integration time .    in this paper ,",
    "the adi technique is described and its performance is analyzed using a simple analytical model and data from the gemini altair adaptive optics system and the niri near infrared camera . the psf stability with altair / niri is studied and its impact on adi performances is discussed .",
    "detection limits for three stars of our ongoing young nearby star survey are then shown . a comparison between adi and normal imaging is also presented .",
    "finally , the possibility of using adi with other high - contrast imaging techniques is discussed .",
    "adi is a psf calibration technique that can , in principle , suppress the psf quasi - static structure by a large factor @xcite .",
    "it consists of the acquisition of a sequence of images with an altitude / azimuth telescope and the instrument rotator turned off ( at the cassegrain focus ) or adjusted ( nasmyth ) to keep the instrument and telescope optics aligned .",
    "this setup improves the stability of the quasi - static psf structure throughout the sequence while it causes a slow rotation of the field of view ( fov ) with respect to the instrument .",
    "note that only the fov , not the psf , rotates with time .",
    "since the fov rotates during an exposure , companion psfs are smeared azimuthally .",
    "this effect increases linearly with angular separation and slightly decreases companions peak intensity .",
    "short exposures and the use of an optimized aperture photometry box can minimize this effect . for each image , after data reduction and image registration of the whole sequence , a reference psf obtained from other images of the same sequence is subtracted to remove the quasi - static structure . given enough fov rotation during the sequence , this subtraction preserves the signal from any eventual companion .",
    "all the image differences are then rotated to align the fov and are median combined .",
    "this technique offers a number of advantages over more classical ground - based observations since the target observations themselves are used to construct a reference psf .",
    "this means that the reference psf has the same spectrum and brightness as the target and that no time is lost to acquire reference observations of a different target .",
    "ghost images from optical reflections and the sky flux are also removed by the subtraction .",
    "the detector flat field errors are averaged since the fov is integrated with different pixels as it rotates on the detector .",
    "the adi technique is a generalization of the `` roll deconvolution '' technique used with hst since several images , each at a different field angle , are acquired and combined .",
    "a technique similar to adi has been developed independently by @xcite to search for circumstellar disks .",
    "for each reduced and registered image of an adi sequence , a reference psf has to be built from the images of the same sequence .",
    "the way that this reference psf is built is of great importance since it directly affects the noise attenuation performance .",
    "we have used two methods to construct the reference psf .",
    "the first method is simply to take the median of all the images of the sequence .",
    "if enough field rotation has occurred during the sequence so that an eventual point source has moved by at least twice its full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , then this point source will be largely rejected by the median which will leave only the average psf .",
    "the minimum radial separation at which this occurs is noted @xmath5 . since",
    "the median is taken over a large number of images , the pixel - to - pixel noise ( i.e. psf , flat field , dark and sky poisson noises and detector readout noise ) of the reference image is much less than that of any individual image .",
    "thus this first method minimizes the noise in regions where the residuals are limited by pixel - to - pixel noise .",
    "however , since a sequence typically lasts more than an hour , the reference psf only has modest quasi - static speckle correlation with the individual images of the sequence .",
    "the second method is to take the median of only a few images as close in time as possible but for which the displacement due to field rotation between the images is , at a given separation , at least 1.5 psf fwhm .",
    "this displacement ensures that the flux inside the psf core of an eventual point source is not significantly reduced by the subtraction .",
    "the time @xmath6 required for such field rotation is function of the separation angle from the target , the target azimuth @xmath7 and zenith distance @xmath8 and the telescope latitude @xmath9 .",
    "the rotation rate @xmath10 ( degree / minute ) of the fov is obtained from the time derivative of the parallactic angle and is given @xcite by    @xmath11    figure 1 is provided as a reference to determine the time interval for observations from the summit of the mauna kea .",
    "this second technique provides better quasi - static speckle noise attenuation since the reference psf is built using images acquired at short time intervals .",
    "however , the pixel - to - pixel noise of the reference image may not be negligible compared to that of an individual image .    the first method is optimized for regions where the residuals are limited by pixel - to - pixel noise while the second is optimized for regions where the residuals are still limited by speckle noise .",
    "the combination of both techniques into a single reduction algorithm will be discussed in section  [ adialgo ] .",
    "the adi technique attenuates the psf noise in two steps : ( i ) by subtraction of a reference image to remove correlated speckles and ( ii ) by the combination of all residual images after fov alignment to average the residual noise .",
    "the noise attenuation @xmath12 is defined as the ratio of the local noise @xmath13 in an image over the noise @xmath14 of the residual image .",
    "the noise attenuation obtained by the subtraction of the reference psf , @xmath15_{\\rm{s}}(\\theta , \\tau , t_{\\rm{exp}})$ ] , is a function of the angular separation , @xmath16 , the time interval @xmath17 between the image and its reference and the individual image exposure time @xmath18 ( including overheads ) .",
    "strong quasi - static speckle correlation between successive images leads to strong attenuation and thus better detection limits for a given total integration time .",
    "a good and stable seeing is thus expected to deliver better adi quasi - static speckle attenuation . for a perfect case when",
    "all static and quasi - static speckles have been removed by adi , detection limits are ultimately limited by short - lived atmospheric speckles that have a correlation timescale of a few tens of ms , shorter than the time interval required to obtain sufficient fov rotation to build the adi reference psf .",
    "the additional noise attenuation resulting from the combination of @xmath19 de - rotated residual images is function of the correlation of those images .",
    "this attenuation is given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the effective number of uncorrelated residual images ; if all residuals are uncorrelated , then @xmath22 .",
    "equivalently , for an image sequence of total time @xmath23 , one has to wait for a time    @xmath24    before two de - rotated residual images are decorrelated .",
    "thus the total noise attenuation @xmath12 will be    @xmath25_{\\rm{s } } ( \\theta , \\tau , t_{\\rm{exp } } ) \\rm{.}\\label{eq0}\\ ] ]    for simplicity , let us consider a dominant speckle noise having a correlation timescale @xmath26 .",
    "the adi noise attenuation resulting from the combination of all difference images is function of @xmath26 .",
    "its behavior can be defined for two limiting regimes : a ) when either @xmath26 is much longer than @xmath17 or shorter than @xmath18 and b ) @xmath26 is longer than @xmath18 but shorter than @xmath17 .    in the first regime ,",
    "the residuals of consecutive image differences are decorrelated , either because the correlated structure of the psf which lasts for long times ( @xmath27 ) has been removed , leaving only poisson noise ( @xmath28 ) , or because the psf structure was already uncorrelated between consecutive images in the first place ( @xmath29 ) . in this case",
    ", the speckle attenuation increases with the square root of the total number of image differences .",
    "the decorrelation timescale is simply    @xmath30    in the second regime , since @xmath26 is longer than @xmath18 but shorter than @xmath17 , the residuals of consecutive differences are partially correlated and do not average - out as efficiently .",
    "assuming that only the noise having a spatial scale @xmath2 psf fwhm limits point source detection , the time needed to decorrelate this noise is the shortest time between @xmath31 , the time for a one fwhm fov rotation , and @xmath26 .",
    "the decorrelation timescale is thus    @xmath32    we note that if @xmath17 is several minutes and if individual adi differences are dominated by random short - lived speckles , then the noise attenuation can follow eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] for several images but ultimately converges to eq .  [ eq2 ] when sufficient averaging of short - lived speckles has occurred .",
    "it is important to known that reducing @xmath18 to increase the number of images for a given image sequence of length @xmath33 would not result in better detection limits .",
    "for the first regime , shorter @xmath18 would mean a smaller companion s / n per image ; the final s / n would thus be the same ( neglecting losses due to overheads ) .",
    "for the second regime , a shorter @xmath18 would yeild quasi - static speckles correlated over more consecutive images , also resulting in the same performance .",
    "we emphasize that adi guarantees a gain in detection with increasing observing time for both regimes . in the worst case ,",
    "the speckle attenuation efficiency is limited by field rotation .",
    "this is an enormous advantage over classical observation in which the quasi - static aberrations prevent significant gain after a relatively short observing time .",
    "an equation similar to eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] also applies to classical observations , but in this case there is no @xmath31 since the field is not rotating .",
    "speckle attenuation is then governed by @xmath26 , which can be very large , reducing drastically the efficiency of the observations .",
    "section  [ adivscla ] presents a comparison of adi and classical observations .",
    "the adi technique was first used at the gemini north telescope using the altair adaptive optic system @xcite and the near - infrared camera niri @xcite in queue mode .",
    "observations and detailed results obtained for three stars of our nearby young star survey , vega , hd18803 and hd97334b are presented .",
    "data for two other stars , hip18859 and hd1405 will also be discussed for comparison since they have been acquired with a different technique .",
    "the exposure time was fixed to 30s , a time short enough to minimize psf saturation and the off - axis psf smearing due to the fov rotation during the exposure and long enough to get a good observing efficiency and to be limited by the sky background rather than by the read noise at wide separations .    for vega , hd18803 and hd97334b , the imaging sequence consisted in the acquisition of a series of saturated images in the off methane @xmath34  @xmath35 m 6.5% bandwidth filter with the cassegrain rotator turned off .",
    "this filter was chosen to minimize the brightness ratio of the star to that of methanated exoplanets or brown dwarfs .",
    "unsaturated short exposures were acquired before and/or after the saturated sequence to calibrate detection limits .    for vega , data were obtained on 2004 august 26 and 2004 september 1 ( program gn-2004a - q-11 ) . in total ,",
    "225 and 177 30s exposures were respectively acquired on the 26th and september 1st .",
    "because of vega s brightness , short exposure psfs of a nearby reference star were acquired for photometric calibration . seeing conditions were excellent on the 26th and average on the 1st . images were saturated inside a @xmath366@xmath1 diameter . for hd18803 , 90 30s exposures were obtained on 2004 december 24 ( program gn-2004b - q4 ) and , for hd97334b , 90 30s exposures were acquired on 2005 april 18 ( program gn-2005a - q16 ) . for hd18803 and hd97334b ,",
    "seeing conditions were average to good and psfs were saturated inside diameters of 0.7@xmath1 .",

    "strehl ratios were obtained by analyzing unsaturated data acquired before and after each sequence and by comparing the psf peak intensity with that of a simulated unaberrated psf having the same pixel sampling , bandpass and integrated flux .",
    "it can be deduced from table  [ tabobs ] that since @xmath5 is less than the saturated radius for all three targets , adi can be applied at all separations to detect point sources .    as part of altair science verification we have obtained a sequence of observations of the star hip18859 on 2003 november 18 ( program gn-2003b - sv-102 ) . during this sequence ,",
    "the filter was switched from the broadband @xmath37 filter to a narrow band filter every fourth exposure to acquire unsaturated images .",
    "this data set will be discussed in section  [ psfevol ] .",
    "observations of the star hd1405 were obtained on 2004 august 23 ( program gn-2004b - q-14 ) with the instrument rotator operating to keep the fov orientation fixed throughout the sequence . in total , 38 30s exposures were obtained .",
    "these observations will be used in section  [ adivscla ] for a comparison between adi and classical observations .",
    "the data reduction consists of flat field normalization , bad pixel correction using a median over surrounding pixels , and distortion correction using software provided by the gemini staff ( trujillo , private communication ) and modified to use the idl _ interpolate _ function with cubic interpolation .",
    "images were then copied into larger blank images to ensure that no fov was lost when shifting and rotating images .",
    "the center of the psf of the first image of the sequence was then registered to the image center by minimizing the diffraction spikes residuals after subtraction of a 180-degree rotation of the image .",
    "the rest of the images were then registered by cross - correlation of the diffraction spikes with the first image .",
    "an azimuthally symmetric intensity profile was finally subtracted from each image to remove the smooth seeing halo .      as discussed in section  [ optpess ] ,",
    "two methods can be used to subtract the quasi - static psf structure : subtracting the median of all images or subtracting a reference psf obtained from a few images acquired as close in time as possible .",
    "these two methods can be combined into a single algorithm that optimizes speckle subtraction and minimizes pixel - to - pixel noise .",
    "first , the median of all the images is subtracted from each individual image . for a sequence    @xmath38    of @xmath19 reduced and registered images ( see section  [ reduc ] ) , where @xmath39 is the mean time of exposure @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the fov orientation at time @xmath39 , the first reference subtraction is simply    @xmath42    an optimized reference psf ( second method )",
    "is then obtained for each image by median combining 4 images ( two acquired before and two after ) that show at least a 1.5 fwhm ( one fwhm in the off methane 6.5% filter is equal to @xmath43  pixels ) fov orientation difference .",
    "this choice insures that the average @xmath17 of the reference psf is @xmath00 and that the linear time - evolution of quasi - static speckles having @xmath44 is removed . for the construction of this reference psf",
    ", the image is broken into many annuli to accommodate for the dependence of @xmath6 on the separation .",
    "the intensity of the reference psf is then scaled appropriately inside each annulus to minimize the noise after subtraction .",
    "the scaling factor converges to zero if the annulus is dominated by pixel - to - pixel noise or to unity if it is dominated by correlated speckles .",
    "the optimized reference psf is then subtracted .",
    "this step can be summarized by the following equation for each annulus    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is a normalizing factor to minimize the noise inside the annulus and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the number of images required to get at least a 1.5 fhwm fov orientation difference between @xmath49 and the images acquired respectively before and after @xmath49 .",
    "differences are then rotated to align the fov to that of the first image .",
    "finally , a median is taken over all differences .",

    "the psf noise evolution timescale can be studied through the evolution of the noise attenuation @xmath15 $ ] for the difference of two images as a function of the time interval , @xmath17 .",
    "the noise attenuation is the ratio of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which are the measured rms noises in an annulus of width equal to one psf fwhm in the original and in the difference images respectively . for this analysis ,",
    "all images have first been unsharp masked using an @xmath51 fwhm box to remove low - frequency noise and then median filtered with a @xmath52 fwhm box to remove hot / bad pixels .",
    "this step is necessary to prevent biasing the noise estimate @xmath13 of single images and leaves only speckles that have a spatial scale of the order of one fwhm .",
    "images were subtracted two by two with increasing time interval .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the noise attenuation for vega , hd18803 and hd97334b for angular separations of 2 , 4 , 6 and 8@xmath1 .",
    "all noise attenuation curves show stronger noise attenuation for shorter time intervals . for hd18803 and hd97334b , the noise attenuation reaches @xmath53 inside 4@xmath1 for @xmath542 minutes . at larger separation ,",
    "the residuals are limited by pixel - to - pixel noise . for separations",
    "less than 4@xmath1 , the noise attenuation drops by a factor 2 after approximately 60 minutes . for vega",
    ", the noise attenuation reaches @xmath55 at all separations for @xmath56 minutes and drops by a factor 2 after approximately 15 to 20 minutes .",
    "the stronger noise attenuation achieved on vega and hd97334b for short time intervals could be explained by better seeing that stabilizes the structure and enables a better subtraction .",
    "additionally , since @xmath6 is less than 10 minutes at 1@xmath1 within @xmath57h from the meridian for all targets having a declination @xmath58 to @xmath59 at mauna kea ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , adi can be used with little loss of speckle attenuation ( @xmath030% ) on most of the available sky for separations greater than @xmath60 .",
    "analysis of the hip18859 data set that included a frequent filter change to acquire unsaturated images shows that a drop by a factor of 2 in speckle attenuation occurs following each filter change .",
    "this evolution of the psf structure is probably due to the filter wheel not returning to its exact position after each change .",
    "this suggests that the best observing procedure is to prevent any alteration of the optical setup during an observing sequence to maximize the psf noise stability .",
    "fig  [ fig3 ] shows for all adi targets the average noise attenuations @xmath61_{\\rm{s}}$ ] achieved for one image difference and the noise attenuation @xmath61 $ ] obtained after median combining all the image differences .",
    "again , an @xmath62 fwhm unsharp mask and a @xmath63 fwhm median filter were applied to each image to produce this figure .",
    "each adi difference attenuates by a factor 2 - 10 the quasi - static speckle noise .",
    "note that these attenuations are better than what is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] since here the optimized reference psf is the result of a median of 4 images , 2 acquired before and 2 after .",
    "random speckles are averaged and the linear speckle evolution with time of speckles having at least @xmath64 is removed .",
    "similarly to what was observed in fig  [ fig2 ] , better seeing conditions ( hd97334b compared to hd18803 ) seem to be related to better speckle noise attenuation .",
    "a total noise attenuation of @xmath65 between 0.8 and 10@xmath1 was obtained for hd18803 and hd97334b , while this attenuation reached 100 for vega ( august 26th data ) .",
    "the higher attenuation for vega comes partly from the larger number of images ( 225 _ vs _ 90 ) and partly from better seeing conditions which provided a better attenuation from single image subtractions .",
    "hd97334b and hd18803",
    "noise attenuations are shown to improve at all separations down to the detector saturation limit and clearly below it if we extrapolate the performances shown at 0.8@xmath1 .    the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is generated by dividing the ratio of the noise attenuation of the combined adi difference @xmath61 $ ] over the noise of a single adi differences @xmath61_{\\rm{s}}$ ] by the expected noise attenuation @xmath66 if the noise was decorrelated . from eq .",
    "[ eq0 ]    @xmath67    because the pixels affected by the secondary mirror support diffraction spikes are masked from the images , the effective number of images combined is reduced at some separations . the bottom panel of fig .",

    "all three targets achieve more than 70% of the @xmath66 attenuation expected if residuals are decorrelated . at smaller separations",
    "the attenuation is lower , revealing a correlated noise in successive adi differences that lowers the number of independent images ( see eq .  [ eq2 ] ) .",

    "[ fig3 ] and eq .",
    "[ eqr ] can be used to estimate the residual speckle decorrelation time that is currently limiting adi performances .",
    "[ fig4 ] upper panel shows the estimated decorrelation timescale as a function of angular separation .",
    "typical decorrelation times are of the order 1 - 3 minutes and are generally smaller at larger angular separations . normalizing these curves by the time @xmath68 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] bottom panel ) , it can be deduced that , for separations less than 3@xmath1 , since @xmath69 is less than @xmath31 , adi differences are limited by residual speckles having @xmath70 .",
    "these residual speckles evolve faster than the time needed to obtain an adi reference psf and can not be subtracted by adi . for hd97334b and hd18803 , for separations greater than 3@xmath1 , adi is limited by the fov rotation or the noise is decorrelated ( limited by @xmath18 ) . for vega ,",
    "the decorrelation time increases until @xmath71 and then decreases . the fact that @xmath69 is significantly greater than @xmath31 when @xmath72 suggests that vega adi differences , at those separations , are limited by correlated noises that are bigger than one fwhm .",
    "this noise thus requires more than a fwhm fov rotation to be decorrelated .",
    "the upper limit at @xmath73 fwhm is expected since a minimal fov rotation of 1.5 fwhm ( @xmath6 ) has been chosen to build the adi optimized reference psf .",

    "finally , detection limits were corrected for the altair estimated anisoplanatism following the strehl @xmath75 equation found in the gemini web page    @xmath76    where @xmath16 is expressed in arcsec .",
    "the detection limit obtained with the adi technique on vega at separations greater than @xmath365@xmath1 is two orders of magnitude deeper than the palomar @xmath37-band image @xcite and approximately a factor of ten deeper than the keck @xmath77-band image of @xcite .",

    "adi is a general high - contrast imaging technique that can be applied to any existing or upcoming large altitude / azimuth telescope .",
    "it is also flexible enough to be combined with a number of other high - contrast imaging techniques .",
    "adi at small separations ( @xmath80  1@xmath1 ) requires long time intervals and thus may suffers from psf variations .",
    "these variations come from variable seeing and slowly evolving quasi - static aberrations from the telescope and instrument optics .",
    "unsaturated data inside 0.8@xmath1 are required to estimate performances .",
    "extrapolation from our observations predicts that noise attenuation will be limited by speckles evolving faster than @xmath31 required for a 1 fwhm fov rotation .",
    "speckle noise attenuation of the order of a factor 10 should be feasible for one - hour sequences .",
    "the use of a multi - wavelength instrument @xcite or an ifu @xcite to acquire simultaneous images at multiple wavelengths across the methane absorption bandhead at 1.6  @xmath81 m through the simultaneous spectral differential imaging ( ssdi ) technique @xcite could provide good short - lived and common - path speckle attenuations and increase detection limits .",
    "it has been shown that ssdi instruments are ultimately limited by non - common path aberrations , which are expected to be stable over long periods of time as they come almost entirely from the instrument itself @xcite .",
    "hence , the adi technique nicely complements ssdi since it can be used to subtract the residuals caused by the non - common path aberrations .",
    "future high - contrast instrumentation for 8 - 10 m class or larger telescopes based on high - order adaptive optics ( ao ) systems @xcite will most likely improve the stability of the psf .",
    "thus , if combined to such instruments , adi could prove even more successful .",
    "these new ao systems will also provide the high strehl ratios required to bring coronagraphy at the forefront of high - constrast imaging .",
    "however , even a very good coronagraph can not totally suppress the light from uncorrected quasi - static wavefront errors and some level of quasi - static speckle noise will inevitably be present in coronagraphic observations .",
    "adi would be a nice addition to coronagraphy as it could attenuate those residual speckles .",
    "ideally , all the techniques mentioned above , adi , ssdi , high - order ao and coronagraphy , could be used together to form an extremely powerful tool to detect exoplanets and brown dwarfs around stars .",
    "the adi observing technique was described and its performance using altair / niri at gemini was presented .",
    "it was shown that faint companions can be detected with better s / n when compared to classical observing techniques for a wide range of declinations .",
    "the adi technique produces a reference psf from the same target imaging sequence , removing the need to move to a nearby star for psf calibration or to acquire sky exposures ( for @xmath37-band imaging ) .",
    "since the reference psf is built using images acquired minutes apart , the reference psf shows a good quasi - static speckle correlation .",
    "the stability of the psf plays a crucial role in adi as it not only determines the speckle attenuation from the reference image subtraction but it also determines the regime in which the noise is attenuated with increasing observing time .",
    "it was reported that at gemini with altair / niri using 30s exposures , the psf evolves on timescales of @xmath82 minutes and the attenuation by subtraction of a reference image reaches @xmath83 for short time intervals , achieving better speckle attenuation with better seeing conditions .",
    "the observations of hip18859 , for which a filter change during the sequence reduced significantly the speckle attenuation , underscore the importance of maintaining the optical setup fixed during the sequence .",
    "it was shown that the gain in s / n with increasing total observing time for separation greater than 2@xmath1 reaches more than 70% of the optimal case , indicating that the noise is mostly decorrelated between residual images for these separations .",
    "typical residual speckle decorrelation time is of the order of a few minutes .",
    "the speckle noise residuals decorrelate faster for object having faster fov rotation . in all cases ,",
    "adi guarantees a larger gain with longer observation sequences . to our knowledge , this is the first time that such behavior is clearly demonstrated for an acquisition and reduction technique designed for speckle attenuation . the wall raised by quasi - static speckles that prevents a gain with longer integration time for standard observing techniques @xcite",
    "can thus be removed by adi .",
    "comparison with a classical imaging technique shows that adi achieves 30 times better speckle attenuation in 30 minutes integration time .",
    "the noise attenuation obtained on vega was 100 , reaching a contrast of @xmath3620 magnitudes at 8@xmath1 separation ( 63  au ) .",
    "observations of the young stars hd18803 and hd97334b yielded detection limits in difference of magnitude of 11.1 - 11.9 at 0.8@xmath84 , similar to the sdi camera at vlt ( @xmath85 of @xmath011 at 0.8@xmath1 ) , which is an optimized speckle suppression instrument . when combined to substellar models and estimated age for these stars ,",
    "these observations show that adi is well suited to search for jovian companions having a mass greater than 1 - 2 m@xmath3 50 - 300  au away from nearby young stars .",
    "finally , adi could easily and advantageously be combined with ssdi , high - order ao and coronagraphy to improve the detection limits of exoplanets and brown dwarfs at all separations .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",
    "authors would like to thank ren racine for his comments on the manuscript , franois rigaut and the gemini observing staff for introducing a neutral density filter inside altair that made vega observations possible and michael fitzgerald , paul kalas , james graham , mike liu , rmi soummer and tienne artigau for discussions about data reduction techniques and/or speckle statistic .",
    "the authors wish to recognize and acknowledge the very significant cultural role and reverence that the summit of mauna kea has always had within the indigenous hawaiian community .",
    "we are most fortunate to have the opportunity to conduct observations from this mountain .",
