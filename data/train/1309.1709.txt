    "neutrino oscillation experiments have firmly established the existence of neutrino masses and lepton mixing , implying that new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) is required to account for these observations ( for reviews , see e.g. refs .",
    "one of the most appealing theoretical frameworks to understand the smallness of neutrino masses is the seesaw mechanism . in this context",
    ", the tree - level exchanges of new heavy states generate an effective dimension - five weinberg operator , which then leads to an effective neutrino mass matrix at low energies .",
    "a simple possibility consists of the addition of singlet right - handed neutrinos ( type i seesaw ) . alternatively , color - singlet @xmath4-triplet scalars ( type ii ) or @xmath4-triplet fermions ( type iii ) can be introduced .",
    "as is well known , theories that contain fermions with chiral couplings to the gauge fields suffer from anomalies , i.e. the breaking of gauge symmetries of the classical theory at one - loop level . to make such theories consistent ,",
    "anomalies should be exactly canceled . in the sm",
    ", this cancellation occurs between quarks and leptons within each generation  @xcite .",
    "adding new chiral fermions requires us to arrange the chiral sectors of the new theory so as to cancel the arising gauge anomalies .",
    "one attractive possibility is to realize the anomaly cancellation through the modification of the gauge symmetry .",
    "extra @xmath5 symmetries naturally arise in a wide variety of grand unified and string theories .",
    "one of the interesting features of such theories is their richer phenomenology , when compared with the sm ( for reviews , see e.g. refs .",
    "in particular , the spontaneous breaking of additional gauge symmetries leads to new massive neutral gauge bosons which , if kinematically accessible , could be detectable at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "clearly , the experimental signatures of these theories crucially depend on whether or not the sm particles have nontrivial @xmath0 charges . assuming that the sm fermions are charged under the new gauge group , and that the new gauge boson @xmath6 has a mass around the tev scale , one expects some effects on the lhc phenomenology .    in the context of neutrino seesaw models ,",
    "the implications of anomaly - free constraints based on the gauge structure @xmath7 have been widely studied in the literature  @xcite . in particular , assuming family universal charges , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that type i and type iii seesaw mechanisms can not be simultaneously realized , unless the @xmath0 symmetry is a replica of the standard hypercharge or new fermionic fields are added to the theory . on the other hand , when combined type i / ii or type iii / ii seesaw models are considered , it is always possible to assign nontrivial anomaly - free charges to the fields .",
    "models based on gauge symmetries that are linear combinations of the baryon number @xmath2 and the individual lepton flavor numbers @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) have also been extensively discussed  @xcite . from the phenomenological viewpoint",
    "many aspects of the latter symmetries are similar to those of the @xmath10 symmetry , with @xmath11 being the lepton number .",
    "nevertheless , the flavor information encoded in the new gauge symmetry can lead to definite predictions on the neutrino mass spectrum and mixing .    in this paper",
    ", we consider abelian extensions of the sm based on an extra @xmath0 gauge symmetry , with @xmath12 being an arbitrary linear combination of the baryon number @xmath2 and the individual lepton numbers @xmath8 .",
    "our aim is to perform a systematic study , thus complementing previous works in several aspects . in particular",
    ", we classify all the anomaly - free @xmath0 gauge symmetries that lead to predictive two - zero textures in the effective neutrino mass matrix , obtained via type i , type iii or mixed type i / iii seesaw mechanisms , with a minimal extra matter content .",
    "some of these symmetries have been recently identified in ref .",
    "@xcite in a type i seesaw framework .",
    "we extend the analysis and obtain new solutions not previously found in the literature .",
    "furthermore , we study in detail the phenomenological implications of such symmetries on neutrino oscillation analysis through matter effects .",
    "finally , we also discuss the possibility of discriminating at collider experiments the flavor structure of the neutrino mass matrix and its corresponding gauge symmetry , by studying the decays of the @xmath6 boson into leptons and third - generation quarks .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : anomalyfree ] , by requiring cancellation of gauge anomalies , we study the allowed charge assignments under the new gauge symmetry , when two or three right - handed neutrino singlets or fermion triplets are added to the sm particle content . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pheno ] we then discuss the phenomenological constraints on these theories , requiring consistency with current neutrino oscillation data . in particular , by extending the sm with a minimal extra fermion and scalar content , we study how the new gauge symmetry can constrain the flavor structure of the effective neutrino mass matrix , obtained through a type i or type iii seesaw mechanism .",
    "the possibility of distinguishing different charge assignments ( gauge symmetries ) and seesaw realizations at collider experiments is also briefly addressed .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "we consider a renormalizable theory containing the sm particles plus a minimal extra fermionic and scalar content , so that light neutrinos acquire seesaw masses .",
    "we include singlet right - handed neutrinos @xmath13 and color - singlet @xmath4-triplet fermions @xmath14 to implement type - i and type - iii seesaw mechanisms , respectively .",
    "besides the sm higgs doublet @xmath15 that gives masses to quarks and leptons , a complex scalar singlet field @xmath16 is introduced in order to give majorana masses to @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that each fermion field @xmath17 has a charge @xmath18 under the new @xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "we work in a basis of left- and right - handed fermions : @xmath19 . for quarks ,",
    "a family universal charge assignment is assumed , while leptons are allowed to have nonuniversal @xmath1 charges .",
    "to render the theory free of the @xmath0 anomalies , the following set of constraints must then be satisfied :      where @xmath21 is the number of generations , @xmath22 is the number of right - handed neutrinos and @xmath23 is the number of @xmath4-triplet fermions .",
    "( @xmath24 ) . aside from this constraint",
    ", the number of right - handed neutrinos ( fermion triplets ) is arbitrary .",
    "if both seesaws are simultaneously allowed , cases with @xmath25 and @xmath26 , or @xmath27 and @xmath28 , are viable as well . ] the equations for @xmath29 arise from the requirement of the cancellation of the axial - vector anomalies  @xcite , while the equation for @xmath30 results from the cancellation of the mixed gravitational - gauge anomaly  @xcite .",
    "we remark that , since the @xmath0 gauge symmetry does not constrain the values of the yukawa couplings , any ordering of the charged leptons in the flavor basis is allowed .",
    "therefore , any permutation transformation acting on the above patterns is permitted , provided that it leaves @xmath31 diagonal . in particular , we find the following permutation sets : @xmath32 starting from any pattern belonging to a particular set",
    ", one can obtain any other pattern in the same set by permutations .",
    "we look for all possible type i and/or type iii seesaw realizations of two - zero textures of the neutrino mass matrix @xmath33 compatible with the experimental data , i.e. that lead to a pattern @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "we restrict our analysis to scenarios with @xmath41 . clearly , in our minimal theoretical framework , with only one higgs doublet and one singlet scalar , not all the solutions found can be implemented in a theory free of anomalies under the gauge group @xmath0 , with @xmath42 . in particular , requiring charged leptons to be diagonal ( @xmath43 ) imposes strong constraints on the patterns of the dirac - yukawa mass matrices .",
    "indeed , only matrices @xmath44 and @xmath45 with one nonzero element per column are permitted . in this appendix , nevertheless , we present the complete set of solutions , regardless of their realization or not as anomaly - free theories , since from the model building viewpoint these solutions may be of interest in the context of extended theories or in the presence of discrete symmetries .    in table",
    "[ table3 ] , we present all viable type i ( type iii ) seesaw realizations of two - zero textures of the effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath33 when @xmath46 and the dirac - neutrino yukawa mass matrix @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) is diagonal , i.e. @xmath47 . all cases belong to the permutation set @xmath48 .",
    "table  [ table4 ] shows the viable type i ( type iii ) seesaw realizations of two - zero textures of @xmath33 when @xmath46 and assuming that @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) belongs to a permutation set @xmath49 . only matrices @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) and @xmath33 contained in @xmath48 are allowed , sharing always the same pattern , i.e. exhibiting",
    " parallel \" structures .",
    "one may wonder whether neutrino mass matrices of type @xmath40 , belonging to the permutation set @xmath50 , can be obtained . as it turns out",
    ", this requires matrices @xmath51 ( and @xmath52 ) with two and four zeros , for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . in table",
    "[ table5 ] we present all viable type i ( type iii ) seesaw realizations that lead to the two - zero pattern @xmath40 in the effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath33 . the cases with @xmath55 and @xmath46 are considered . as can be seen from the table , with only two right - handed singlet ( fermion triplet ) neutrinos ,",
    "there are only two possible constructions , both leading to a massless neutrino ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "in fact , these are the only solutions that yield a pattern consistent with neutrino oscillation data ; no textures of type @xmath57 or @xmath58 are found . for @xmath46 ,",
    "besides the @xmath40-pattern , there exist several combinations of matrices @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( not displayed in the table ) , that lead to the viable patterns @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "however , no texture of type @xmath61 , belonging to the permutation set @xmath62 , can be obtained .",
    "the latter can be realized in the context of mixed seesaw schemes . in table",
    "[ table6 ] , several patterns leading to neutrino mass matrices of type @xmath61 through a mixed seesaw with two right - handed neutrinos and two fermion triplets ( @xmath63 ) are shown .",
    "the solutions correspond to cases where the dirac - yukawa mass matrices @xmath51 contain the maximum of allowed vanishing matrix elements , i.e. four zeros .",
    "we remark that in the mixed cases with @xmath64 and @xmath65 there are viable patterns as well , but since they only generate neutrino mass matrices of type @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath40 , we do not present them in table  [ table6 ] .",
