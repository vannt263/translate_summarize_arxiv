    "the idea of the seesaw mechanism for the neutrino mass @xcite @xcite was extended to quark masses sometime ago @xcite-@xcite . at that time",
    ", the top quark mass was not known and it was not expected to be as heavy as the electroweak symmetry breaking scale . therefore all charged fermions were assumed to be lighter than @xmath10 .",
    "the motivation for the construction of the model was to give an explanation for the smallness of the masses of the charged fermions ( quarks and charged leptons ) as compared to the electroweak breaking scale . however , now we know that the top quark is as heavy as o(@xmath10 ) and that has to be taken into account .",
    "koide and fusaoka ( kf ) @xcite and t. morozumi , t. satou , m. n. rebelo and m. tanimoto @xcite studied the top quark mass problem in a seesaw model . based on this successful approach , we can discuss implications of the seesaw model focusing on the experimental data such as flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) and @xmath8 violation . in this paper , we present in detail the formalism and make a systematic phenomenological analysis of the implications of the model . a brief introduction to the dirac seesaw scheme",
    "is given in section 2 , in which the incorporation of the top quark is outlined . in section 3",
    "we show how the mass hierarchy and the flavor mixing are introduced .",
    "section 4 is devoted to estimating tree level fcnc . in section 5 ,",
    "the flavor mixing in the charged currents is studied and the parameterization of the generalized cabbibo kobayashi maskawa ( ckm ) matrix is specified .",
    "@xcite @xcite in section 6 , the @xmath11 mixing and the @xmath8 violating parameter @xmath1 are studied and the constraint on the parameters of the present model is obtained . in section 7 , the rare k meson decays @xmath12 are studied in the present model .",
    "the effect of the scalar interaction on the resulting pion energy spectrum is given .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 8 .",
    "let us first summarize the ideas of the seesaw model for quark masses .",
    "the gauge group of the standard model ( sm ) is extended to @xmath13 , so that the usual yukawa mass terms for the charged fermions are not allowed , since now the right handed charged fermions belong to an @xmath14 doublet .",
    "that is : + _ su(2)_r ( |_l d_r ) 0 .",
    "[ eq:1 ] the @xmath14 gauge boson must be much heavier than the @xmath15 gauge boson because we do not see any deviation from the v - a structure of the charged currents , thus the symmetry has to be broken at a sufficiently high energy scale .",
    "the representation of the higgs breaking @xmath14 is chosen in such a way that no renormalizable mass term for the standard - like fermions is allowed .",
    "therefore , for example , the higgs bi - doublet @xmath16 under @xmath17 is excluded .",
    "a single higgs doublet , @xmath18 , is used for breaking @xmath14 . with this higgs field ,",
    "the possible mass term for the standard - like quarks is the dimension 5 operator , |_l _ l _ r^_r , [ eq:2 ] where @xmath19 is some new physics scale .",
    "the scale must be larger than @xmath20 ( vev of @xmath21 ) .",
    "quarks and charged leptons acquire their masses , which are much smaller than the electroweak breaking scale , @xmath22 ( i.e. , vev of @xmath23 ) , through the dimension 5 operator : m_f= _ l _ r _ new , [ eq:3 ] where @xmath24 now we can think of what is the fundamental theory behind this dimension 5 operator . the interaction can be reproduced if we introduce new heavy isosinglet quarks ( and charged leptons ) and integrate them out .",
    "these isosinglet quarks can have bare mass terms , and the new physics scale , @xmath25 , is identified with that mass .",
    "such a renormalizable theory is given , in the quark sector , by the following lagrangian terms : = -y_l|_l_l u_r- y_r|_r_r u_l + ( h.c.)- m_u |u u. [ eq:4 ] using this lagrangian , we may compute the feynman diagram in which the heavy singlet quark is exchanged , obtaining for the dimension 5 operator : = y_l y_r^ m_u . [ eq:5 ] however this formula leads to the suppression of the quark masses by a factor of @xmath14 _ breaking scale divided by singlet quark mass _ compared to the electroweak breaking scale , hence it can not be applied to the top quark . in order to prevent the seesaw mechanism to act for the top quark we assume that the corresponding singlet quark has a bare mass much smaller than the @xmath14 breaking scale .",
    "in this case , ignoring flavor mixing for the moment , the top quark only acquires mass through a dimension 4 yukawa coupling , instead of the mechanism of exchange of a heavy singlet quark . to illustrate ,",
    "let us consider the extreme limit in which the bare mass is set to zero in eq.([eq:4 ] ) , so that we have @xmath26 these are dimension 4 operators and the singlet quark can not be integrated out because the bare mass term is absent .",
    "the diagonalization is performed through maximal mixing for the right - handed sector , as follows : @xmath27 ( the superscript @xmath28 denoting the mass states ) , leading to : m_t = |y_l| _ l , m_t= |y_r| _ r , [ eq:8 ] and @xmath29 is of the order of the experimental value .",
    "if we retain the bare mass term , i.e. , @xmath30 , the mass formulae are given by @xmath31",
    "we will now extend our analysis to the case where flavor mixing is present and the number of generations is three , based on the following lagrangian : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are real parameters .",

    "the upper bound on @xmath68 is obtained in this case .",
    "the upper curve corresponds to the case ( 1 ) , i.e. , @xmath323 .",
    "since @xmath300 is larger than one which would be obtained by the sm fit , the negative contribution is needed .",
    "this is achieved by taking @xmath324 larger . to maintain this effect while taking @xmath68 larger",
    ", @xmath325 must increase .",
    "we use the following experimental inputs to determine the allowed range of @xmath326 : @xmath327 , @xmath328 , @xmath329 and @xmath330 @xcite@xcite .",
    "we also use @xmath274 .",
    "the above constraints are shown in @xmath326 plane .",
    "( see fig.9 . ) in order to find the @xmath242 dependence of our result , we also show the allowed region by taking @xmath331 with @xmath301 and @xmath332 in fig.8 .",
    "we can also discuss the @xmath211 exchange effect on @xmath333 mixing .",
    "the contribution to @xmath334 is given as @xmath335 where @xmath336 and @xmath337 in the sm , the top quark intermediate state dominates the @xmath338 mixing .",
    "the @xmath211 exchange contribution is also dominated by the top flavor intermediate state , however , this contribution is suppressed by @xmath282 , that is of order @xmath339 compared with the sm contribution .",
    "thus , for @xmath338 mixing , the @xmath228 effect is negligible .",
    "experiments in the @xmath340 meson system have entered a new period with the observation of the rare process @xmath341 , and the dedicated search for @xmath342 .",
    "recently , the signature of the decay @xmath343 has been observed by e787 collaboration @xcite and the reported branching ratio is @xmath344 , which is consistent with the value predicted by the sm .",
    "additional ( and improved ) data are expected in the near future . in view of this situation ,",
    "a detailed study of the rare @xmath340 meson decays is necessary .",
    "the decay @xmath345 is one of the most promising processes , since it is a @xmath8 violating mode in the sm .",
    "this mode is theoretically clean to extract the ckm parameter @xmath300 @xcite .",
    "we investigate rare @xmath340 meson decays in the present model introducing right handed neutrinos .",
    "however , in the model , the neutrino masses are zero in the tree level and lepton flavor is well conserved ( see analyses within other models @xcite ) .",
    "scalar and tensor operators appear due to the lr box diagrams , in which both the left and right handed gauge bosons , @xmath346 and @xmath347 , are exchanged .",
    "the scalar operators have an enhancement factor @xmath5 in the matrix element @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the scalar operator may make a large contribution to the rare @xmath340 meson decays , @xmath348 and @xmath349 .",
    "an important point is that the @xmath8 property of the scalar interaction is different from the v - a interaction @xmath350 in the sm .",
    "the decay @xmath345 through the scalar operator is not a @xmath8 violating one , so we have a non - zero branching ratio @xmath351 even in the @xmath8 conserved limit ( @xmath352 ) .",
    "thus , it is important to estimate the size of the effect of the scalar operator on the pion energy spectrum .",
    "the rare @xmath353 decays are loop - induced fcnc processes in the sm , that , being dominated by short - distance physics , are theoretically very clean modes @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements involved in these decays are related to the experimentally well known decay @xmath354 using isospin symmetry , and corrections to this relation have been studied @xcite .",
    "we start our analysis of such decays with the following effective lagrangian , which is produced from the lr box diagram in addition to the sm contributions : @xmath355,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath356 .",
    "the first term is the sm contribution @xcite , and from the second to the fifth are the new contributions arising in this model .",
    "the scalar and tensor operators generally appear from box diagrams when one considers a model which contains the right - handed charged gauge boson @xmath347 . as a concrete analysis , in section 7.3 , we investigate the pion energy spectrum for lr symmetric scenario , @xmath357 and @xmath358 , which correspond to the limit @xmath359 with @xmath360 .",
    "there are also penguin diagram contributions to the process we are interested in .",
    "however , only the box diagrams produce the scalar operator @xmath361 in the effective lagrangian , thus , we do not consider the contributions from penguin diagrams in this paper .",
    "first we show the decay amplitudes for the neutral k meson states @xmath7 and @xmath362 .",
    "are : @xmath363    the @xmath8 conserved limit corresponds to @xmath364 , with all coefficients @xmath365 and @xmath366 real . in this limit ,",
    "the decay amplitude @xmath367 through the v - a interaction is zero , while @xmath368 is nonzero , and the decays through the scalar operators @xmath369 remain non - zero generally . in the lr symmetric parameterization ,",
    "@xmath225 decay through the scalar operators is the @xmath8 violating mode , while @xmath8 is conserved for @xmath224 decay .",
    "thus decays of neutral @xmath340 meson in the lr symmetric parameterization are summarized as follows : @xmath370    experimentally we do not observe the neutrinos , and the pion energy spectrum is obtained by summing these contributions which have different @xmath8 properties with each other .",
    "the @xmath7 decay through the v - a operator is suppressed due to @xmath8 symmetry , but decays through the scalar operators are @xmath8 conserving ones , furthermore their matrix elements are enhanced , @xmath371 ( where @xmath372 ) , as we can see from the equation of motion in the next subsection .",
    "thus , the contribution of the scalar interaction to the decay amplitude @xmath373 is sizable and dominates in the @xmath8 conserving limit .",
    "the decay amplitude for the charged @xmath340 meson , @xmath374 , is obtained in the same way : @xmath375 where @xmath376 .      in this section",
    ", we explain our estimations of the matrix elements and show explicit forms of the coefficient functions in the lr model .",
    "the matrix elements in the sm , @xmath377 , can be related to the matrix elements of the experimentally well known leading decay @xmath378 using isospin symmetry .",
    "so the form factors @xmath379 and @xmath380 are written in terms of @xmath381 .",
    "the matrix element of the scalar operator @xmath382 is also related to these by the equation of motion : @xmath383 where @xmath384 are the form factors of the corresponding matrix element @xmath385 .",
    "we estimate the matrix element of the tensor operator using the njl model .",
    "first we note that the matrix element of the operator is the second order of the typical momentum . therefore in the sense of the chiral perturbation",
    ", it is enough to estimate the form factor @xmath386 at zero momentum transfer , which is defined by @xmath387 .",
    "the su(3 ) breaking effect may be also neglected .",
    "calculating the feynman diagram shown in fig.10 , the form factor is given by @xmath388 where @xmath389 is a constituent quark mass and @xmath390 is the pion decay constant .",
    "as a rough order estimate , we assume @xmath391 mev , @xmath392 mev . then we obtain , @xmath393 . substituting the value in the pion energy spectrum , we can see that it is safely neglected .",
    "now we show the explicit form of the coefficient functions @xmath394 and @xmath395 in the model .",
    "we calculate box diagrams , in which the left handed @xmath346 boson and the right handed gauge boson @xmath268 are exchanged , as seen in fig.7 .",
    "there are corresponding charged higgs diagrams due to the gauge invariance .",
    "the internal upper fermion lines correspond to the ordinary and the singlet quarks , the lower ones correspond to the sm and the singlet leptons .",
    "the coefficients in the effective lagrangian are : @xmath396 where @xmath397 is the mixing angle between a singlet left / right handed quark and the corresponding doublet quark as defined in eq.([qqmix ] ) , and @xmath398 are @xmath153 ckm matrix elements .",
    "in addition to the parameters @xmath399 and @xmath83 of eq.([parameter ] ) , new dimensionless parameters @xmath400 are defined by : @xmath401 where @xmath402 are mass eigenvalues of the ordinary leptons @xmath403 , @xmath404 and @xmath405 , while @xmath406 are the corresponding additional heavy lepton masses .    the function @xmath407 is defined by replacing @xmath408 with @xmath409 in eq.([ftilde ] ) :    @xmath410    the other coefficients , @xmath411 and @xmath412 , can be obtained by interchanging the indices @xmath413 and @xmath414 . in the limit",
    "when @xmath415 , @xmath416 and @xmath417 .",
    "thus , we simply write them as @xmath418 or @xmath419 and take the coefficients as lr symmetric .",
    "the coefficients @xmath418 ( @xmath420 ) for electron and muon are negligibly small due to the smallness of @xmath421 and @xmath422 , and only @xmath423 contributes to the process significantly .",
    "the coefficient function @xmath423 evaluated with @xmath424 gev is : @xmath425 where @xmath426 , @xmath427 and @xmath428 in the wolfenstein parameterization .",
    "the coefficient for the up quark is negligible . for the top quark",
    ", the coefficient function is enhanced by its heavy mass , but suppressed by the ckm factor @xmath429 , as compared to @xmath430 from the charm quark .",
    "thus , the contribution from the top quark in the model is small in the case of lr symmetric case .",
    "it is important that all the coefficients of the lr model are suppressed by the factor @xmath83 , so the v - a interaction of the sm dominates as @xmath431 becomes large .",
    "we present the pion energy spectrum obtained using the coefficients of eq.([scalarcoe ] ) and eq.([tensorcoe ] ) . in the process @xmath345 ,",
    "the contributions from scalar interactions are controlled by @xmath83 and the enhancement factor @xmath432 in the matrix element @xmath433 . for sm ,",
    "the decay amplitude of @xmath345 is proportional to @xmath300 , thus the contributions of scalar interactions relative to that of sm for the pion energy spectrum is @xmath434 . in the process @xmath3 , contributions from the scalar and tensor interactions are tiny compared to the sm one .",

    "the process @xmath443 is a more sensitive probe of the scalar interactions , as discussed in the previous section .",

    "the contribution from the tensor operator is suppressed by the kinematical factor @xmath449 in the low pion energy region , @xmath450 , whereas at large pion energies , @xmath451 , it is suppressed by the factor @xmath452 . furthermore , decay through the tensors is @xmath8 violating and has no enhancement factor . hence , the contribution from the tensor operator is negligible compared to the scalar operator and the sm contributions .",
    "the form factors are related to those of the experimentally well known decay mode @xmath453 . in fig.12",
    "we show the pion energy spectrum , @xmath454 , multiplied by a factor @xmath455 .    to see the dependence of the branching ratio on @xmath300 , we plotted three curves , which correspond to the cases @xmath456 .",
    "the solid lines are the pion energy spectra in the lr model , the doted lines are the corresponding sm prediction , where we have taken @xmath457 and @xmath458 .",
    "the lr contribution is large in the low energy region @xmath459 , while in the high energy region the sm contribution dominates . in fig.13",
    ", we study the dependence of the pion energy spectrum on @xmath68 . notice that as the coefficient functions of the effective lagrangian are proportional to @xmath83 , @xmath460 is proportional to @xmath461 .",
    "the effect is negligible for @xmath462 and the energy spectrum reduces to the prediction of the sm .    the effect of the new physics can be seen in the pion energy spectrum of the @xmath463 decay for @xmath464 . on the other hand ,",
    "the analyses of @xmath210 mixing have given a constraint of @xmath465 , which may discourage the search for new physics in this decay mode .",
    "however , it is important to comment on the constraint @xmath466 .",
    "this bound has been obtained from the box diagram of the @xmath211 intermediate state .",
    "we assumed , as is usual , that the short distance effect dominates @xmath210 mixing .",
    "however , if long distance physics dominates the mixing , the constraint of @xmath465 is no longer valid .",
    "we present the formalism and systematic analyses of the seesaw model for quark masses . a framework allowing the top quark mass to be of the order of the electroweak symmetry breaking scale is explained .",
    "the derivation of the quark mass formulae is presented in detail with flavour mixing included .",
    "there , it is shown that expanding simply by the inverse power of the singlet quark mass matrix fails and we propose an alternative expansion to overcome the problem .",
    "furthermore , we find that a quark basis in which the singlet and doublet mixing yukawa coupling is a triangular matrix is appropriate for finding the mass base .",
    "starting in such a basis , by neglecting the flavor off - diagonal yukawa couplings , we can reproduce the quark mass formulae which are obtained as the solutions of the eigenvalue equation . also , we give the theoretical formulae for the tree level fcnc .",
    "the tree level fcnc in the model are naturally suppressed as ( _ quark masses_)@xmath108 _ divided by an _",
    "@xmath109 _ breaking scale_@xmath110 .",
    "the effect on rare @xmath340 and @xmath467 decays is far below both the present experimental bound and the prediction of the standard model . as for fcnc beyond the tree level ,",
    "the one loop effect involving the right - handed gauge boson exchange is discussed for @xmath468 mixing and for @xmath469 .",
    "@xmath226 and @xmath1 give constraints on the parameters of the model @xmath50 and @xmath68 .",
    "we reanalyse the beall , bander and soni bound for @xmath68 in the present model and show the lower bound of @xmath68 is about @xmath470 .",
    "the constraint of @xmath1 is interesting and we show the allowed region in ( @xmath471 ) .",
    "if the allowed region of ( @xmath320 ) is tightened by the data of the b factory and/or by the improvement of the lattice computation of the hadronic matrix element , the allowed region will be much more specified than the present one .",
    "alternatively the effect of the new physics can be seen the @xmath463 decay in the case of @xmath472 .",
    "there is a scalar operator in the effective lagrangian , which come from lr box diagrams . for the decay @xmath473",
    ", there is a significant contribution from the scalar operator , especially in the low energy region of the pion energy spectrum , which , for the values @xmath474 and @xmath475 , amounts to an enhancement of about @xmath476 to the total branching ratio .",
    "thus , measuring the decay @xmath473 precisely may be important to probe the effect from new physics",
