    "nano - technology requires an accurate control of the interacting components , both in terms of detection and preparation .",
    "this is a major motivation for the considerable attention that was devoted recently to sub - wavelength localization of single particles .",
    "several remarkable schemes were proposed to achieve this goal  @xcite . of related interest",
    "is the problem of localizing and distinguishing two nearby particles",
    ". optical resolution of two molecules at the nanometer scale and manipulation of their degree of entanglement was experimentally demonstrated in  @xcite , and the collective interaction between pairs of oriented nanostructures was considered in  @xcite .",
    "also the measurement of the relative position of two atoms assisted by spontaneous emission  @xcite or the measurements of interparticle separations on a scale smaller than the emission wavelength  @xcite were investigated in detail .",
    "somewhat related , considerable effort is devoted to quantum lithography  @xcite .",
    "the above localization schemes , however , have in common that they apply to the localization of a single particle or to the measurement of relative position of two individual particles . in many cases of interest , however , an ensemble of particles is concentrated to a small region in space such that the ensemble properties become relevant , while the properties of the individual ensemble constituents can not be resolved or are rapidly fluctuating in time .    therefore , here we describe a scheme capable of localizing an ensemble of two - level atoms which are bunched together in a volume much smaller than an emission wavelength .",
    "possible realizations include small clusters , few - atom impurities , or atoms trapped , e.g. , in optical lattices .",
    "the localization relies on the coherent interaction with a standing - wave electromagnetic field .",
    "since the interatomic distances are small , the atoms interact collectively via the environmental vacuum modes .",
    "one consequence of this is the appearance of superfluorescence , i.e. , the scattered light intensity scales with the number of atoms @xmath0 squared ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "we find that the fluorescence light emitted collectively by the ensemble is a function of the ensemble position in the standing wave .",
    "in particular , for suitable standing wave parameters and for ensemble positions around the nodes of the standing wave field , the emitted fluorescence intensity sharply drops to a minimum over a narrow spatial region .",
    "the narrow width of the dip in the spatial intensity profile is a direct consequence of the collectivity .",
    "since this collective fluorescence intensity profile is our main observable , we discuss the profile in detail in terms of the available free parameters , and show that the profile can be tailored to suit a given localization setup . based on these results ,",
    "we then propose two schemes which exploit this spatial fluorescence intensity profile to localize an ensemble of atoms .",
    "first , we assume the sample to be fixed within the standing wave field . in this case",
    ", the spatial fluorescence intensity profile can be scanned along the standing wave axis by changing the relative phase of the laser fields forming the standing wave .",
    "a continuous measurement of the intensity of the scattered light throughout this scan reveals the position of the sample on a sub - wavelength scale .",
    "we further show that this setup also enables one to measure the distance between two samples , the number of atoms in a sample , or the linear dimension of the sample .",
    "second , we consider an atom cluster flying through the standing wave field . here",
    "a scanning is not possible due to the short interaction time of ensemble and standing wave field .",
    "rather , the absolute intensity of the scattered light can be used to recover the crossing position of the ensemble .",

    "the minimum width of the intensity dip is close to the position where symmetric state combinations can be expected , whereas no structure can be found towards asymmetric collective states .",
    "a direct identification of the position of the detuning with minimum dip width is difficult , however , since the collective - state basis of a multi - particle sample includes many symmetric collective states . in the example of fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] , in a very small range around the node @xmath81 the dip at @xmath115 is narrowest , but its width increases faster in moving away from the node than it does for slightly lower values of @xmath116 .",

    "[ fig-2 ] , which , however , is not of interest for our current localization scheme .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig-4 ] , we show the dependence of the collective intensity on the number of particles in the sample .",
    "this is different from the previous results , since by changing the number of atoms , both the scaled rabi frequency @xmath118 and the scaled detuning @xmath119 are changed at the same time .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig-4 ] that for a given standing wave intensity and a given detuning , varying the number of atoms in the ensemble changes the width of the intensity dip at the nodes .",
    "this can be understood by noting that a change of the number of atoms effectively shifts the position of the symmetric state resonance . since the laser field frequencies are kept fixed in fig .",
    "[ fig-4 ] , this corresponds to moving along the @xmath116 axis in figs .",
    "[ fig-2 ] and [ fig-3 ] . therefore",
    ", different widths of the intensity dip can be observed . the maximum intensity changes with @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig-4 ] , since in this figure the unscaled rabi frequency @xmath120 is kept fixed .",
    "it should be noted that the parameters in fig .",
    "[ fig-4 ] are such that for any shown number of atoms , the scaled rabi frequency @xmath118 dominates the dynamics .",

    "the figure depicts a possible experimental implementation of our scheme .",
    "an atom ensemble ( green dot ) is assumed fixed inside the standing wave field .",
    "a detector measures the scattered fluorescence light , while the phase of the standing wave field is varied .",
    "the black curve symbolizes the fluorescence intensity profile as , e.g. , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] . if the intensity dip does not coincide with the ensemble position , then a high intensity of fluorescence is detected .",
    "but if the dip sweeps across the ensemble position , then the measured intensity drops to a minimum over a narrow spatial range , thus providing a sub - wavelength localization.,width=226 ]      after the discussion of the collective fluorescence intensity as our main observable , we now turn to the application of this observable to the localization of a collection of atoms . as the first setup",
    ", we consider a collection of atoms which is fixed inside the standing wave field at an unknown position . in order to detect the position of the sample ,",
    "the total collective fluorescence intensity is continuously monitored , which may already provide a coarse position measurement .",
    "then the relative phase of the two counter - propagating fields forming the standing wave is changed , such that the nodal structure of the field shifts along the standing wave propagation axis . throughout this shift ,",
    "the detected intensity is modulated in time with the collective fluorescence intensity profile , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig - sweep ] .",
    "if the intensity profile is located such that its dip does not coincide with the actual position of the sample , then the intensity is near its maximum value , see fig .",
    "[ fig - sweep](a ) .",
    "but if the two positions coincide , then the intensity vanishes , see fig .",
    "[ fig - sweep](b ) . obviously , for this scheme it is desirable to have the intensity dip as narrow as possible in order to achieve a localization well below the usual diffraction limit .",
    "according to our results of sec .",
    "[ sec - int ] , this can be achieved by using a strong standing wave field and by tuning it close to the symmetric collective state resonance .",
    "for instance , the solid curve in fig .  [ fig-1 ] has a width of about @xmath122 , corresponding to @xmath123 .",
    "note , however , that the obtained accuracy is also limited by the spatial size of the ensemble , if the dip width is smaller than the linear dimension of the sample .",

    "( a ) shows the schematic setup . an ensemble indicated by the green dot passes through a standing wave field .",
    "the intensity of the scattered fluorescence light is measured .",
    "( b ) via the fluorescence intensity profile , the measured intensity can be related to the sub - wavelength particle position . the higher the slope of the intensity profile , the better is the accuracy of the localization .",
    "in this figure , the horizontal bars indicate two measurement outcomes with a certain uncertainty .",
    "the vertical bars show the corresponding potential positions .",
    "the black curve is a fluorescence intensity profile as , e.g. , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-1].,width=226 ]    the present scheme can also be used to measure the distance between the center of masses of two ensembles by relating the required phase shifts between two positions with vanishing intensity to the measured intensity profile . further , since the width of the intensity dip depends on the number of atoms in the ensemble if all other parameters remain fixed [ see fig .",
    "[ fig-4 ] ] , this scheme can also be used to obtain the number of atoms in the ensemble located in the standing wave field by measuring the width of the intensity dip via the sweep of the standing wave phase .",
    "finally , the spatial dimension of the sample can be measured from the width of the intensity dip if the other parameters are known .",
    "it should be noted that , in contrast to the precision position detection , these measurements relying on the determination of the width of the intensity dip are relative measurements in the sense that they do not require a reference to obtain the absolute standing wave phase",
    ". only the change of the phase is relevant , and thus also knowledge of the actual position of the sample within the standing wave field is not required for these relative measurements .",
    "the maximum attenuation of the fluorescence intensity depends on the width of the collection relative to the width of the dip in the intensity profile .",
    "if the profile dip is narrower than the sample , then the dip only affects part of the sample .",
    "still , this will result in a sudden reduction of the fluorescence intensity , which is sufficient to determine the onset of the overlap of intensity dip and atom sample .",
    "also , a continuous scan of the standing wave phase results in repeated intensity dips over time which can be used to suppress statistical errors in the measurement .      in this section",
    ", we discuss a different experimental setup .",
    "we now assume that a collection of atoms ( atomic cluster ) flies through a standing wave field at an unknown position on the standing wave field axis .",
    "the aim is to gain as much information on the position as possible by measuring the collective resonance fluorescence . obviously , the scanning - dip scheme described in sec .",
    "[ sec - sweep ] is not suitable for this kind of setup , since the change of the standing wave phase is too slow as compared to the interaction time of field and atom ensemble . in the present scheme",
    ", we only have to require that the time of flight @xmath124 through the standing wave field is much larger than the time @xmath125 needed to evolve into the steady state .",
    "for example , for a thermal beam with velocity @xmath126  m / s and a standing wave field width of @xmath127  mm , the flight time is about @xmath128  s. the steady - state time @xmath125 is of the order @xmath129 . for @xmath130",
    "mhz and @xmath131 , one obtains @xmath132  s and thus @xmath133 . note that the preparation of atom clusters has been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we now make use of the fact that position information can be gained from the absolute value of the scattered light intensity during the flight of the ensemble through the field . the schematic setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - single](a ) . the measured intensity allows to fix a horizontal section in a collective fluorescence intensity plot versus ensemble position as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - single](b ) .",
    "ideally , this section provides a set of few discrete points where the intensity profile crosses the measured intensity .",
    "these points correspond to the potential positions of the ensemble . from the two examples in fig .",
    "[ fig - single](b ) it is clear that the localization for a given intensity measurement with a measurement uncertainty becomes better with increasing slope of the intensity profile . a high slope , however , leads to a pronounced plateau with almost constant intensity in between the dips .",
    "this means that , in case of a narrow dip , for large parts of the single wavelength width only a rather inaccurate localization is possible .",
    "therefore , in contrast to the sweep scheme in sec .",
    "[ sec - sweep ] , in this setup a wide intensity dip is desirable in order to achieve sub - wavelength localization for all possible positions .",
    "the reason is that for a wide intensity dip , wide plateaus in the intensity profile are avoided .",
    "a wide intensity dip can be achieved , for example , by working with weaker standing wave fields or far away from the symmetric collective state resonance .",
    "we have described a scheme to localize small atomic samples with sub - wavelength accuracy .",
    "the scheme relies on measuring the super - fluorescence radiation scattered in a standing wave field .",
    "we have demonstrated that external parameters such as the strength of the applied lasers or the detuning from the atomic resonance are convenient tools to tailor the localization region for a given experimental setup . based on these results ,",
    "two possible experimental situations have been considered .",
    "first , for fixed samples , a scanning - dip spectroscopy was proposed . here , the standing wave field phase is changed in order to scan the fluorescence intensity profile along the cavity axis in order to reveal the actual position of the sample .",
    "this setup also allows for a number of relative measurements , for example , of distance between two collections , of the number of atoms in a sample , or of the linear dimension of the sample .",
    "second , for samples passing through the standing wave field only once , a single - pass scheme was discussed , which relates the maximum intensity measured to the passing position of the sample .",

    "<S> the localization relies on the interaction of the ensemble with a standing wave laser field . </S>",
    "<S> the light scattered in the interaction of standing wave field and atom ensemble depends on the position of the ensemble relative to the standing wave nodes . </S>",
    "<S> this relation can be described by a fluorescence intensity profile , which depends on the standing wave field parameters , the ensemble properties , and which is modified due to collective effects in the ensemble of nearby particles . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the intensity profile can be tailored to suit different localization setups . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we apply these results to two localization schemes . </S>",
    "<S> first , we show how to localize an ensemble fixed at a certain position in the standing wave field . </S>",
    "<S> second , we discuss localization of an ensemble passing through the standing wave field . </S>"
