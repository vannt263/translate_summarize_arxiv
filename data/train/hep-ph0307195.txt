    "the analysis of the unitarity triangle ( ut ) and cp violation represents one of the most stringent tests of the standard model ( sm ) and , for this reason , also an interesting window on new physics ( np ) . the input of this analysis is a large number of both experimental and theoretical parameters , the most relevant of which are listed in table [ tab : inputs ] .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to    the angle @xmath0 can be also extracted , in principle , from the measurements of two - body charmless hadronic b decays .",
    "a lot of theoretical investigations have been recently made for these decay channels .",
    "in particular , important progress has been made with the calculation of the amplitudes in the heavy quark limit using the factorization approach  @xcite , though there is still some controversy on the importance of non - leading corrections  @xcite .    from the experimental point of view",
    "an impressive effort has been made to measure as many branching fractions and cp asymmetries as possible ( for a collection of results see @xcite ) .",
    "it would be very interesting in the near future to compare the determination of the angle @xmath0 from the ut analysis and from two - body decays measurements . in the future , at the lhc / btev experiments , @xmath0 will be cleanly measured in the tree - level @xmath1 decays .",
    "the plot in figure [ fig : pull_gamma ] shows the compatibility of the indirect determination of @xmath0 with a future determination of the same angle obtained from b decays .",
    "it can be noted that even in case the angle @xmath0 can be measured with a precision of 10@xmath2 from b decays , the predicted 3@xmath3 region is still rather large , corresponding to the interval [ 25 - 100]@xmath2 . if all the theoretical errors are divided by a factor of two , as indicated by the darker curve , the predicted 3@xmath3 region will be consistently reduced .",
    "although the ckm mechanism is extremely successful , leading in particular to the precise prediction of the value of sin2@xmath4 , it is nevertheless worth to investigate whether the analysis of the ut still allows some room for np effects .",
    "this is the issue we would like to address in this section .",
    "the physical processes entering the analysis and the related physical observables determined from the experiments , are listed in table  [ tab : schema ] . barring the possibility of significant np effects in the determination of the ratio @xmath5 from tree - level processes",
    ", we have explored the possible contributions to @xmath6 mixing ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 mixing .",
    "np contributions introduce in general a large number of new parameters : flavour changing couplings , short distance coefficients and matrix elements of new local operators . the specific list and",
    "the actual values of these parameters depend on the details of the np model . nevertheless ,",
    "each of the mixing process listed in table  [ tab : schema ] , being described by a single amplitude , can be effectively parameterized in a completely general way in terms of only two new parameters , which we choose to quantify the difference of the amplitude in absolute value and phase with respect to the sm one  @xcite .",
    "thus , for instance , in the case of @xmath6 mixings we define @xmath9 where @xmath10 includes only the sm box diagrams , while @xmath11 includes also the np contributions . by definition , in the absence of np effects , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the experimental quantities determined from the @xmath6 mixings and listed in table  [ tab : schema ] are related to their sm counterparts and the np parameters by the following relations : @xmath14 and @xmath15 as far as the @xmath8 mixing is concerned , we find it convenient to introduce a single parameter which relates the imaginary part of the amplitude to the sm one @xmath16 } { { \\rm im}[\\langle k^0|h_{eff}^{sm}|\\bar{k}^0\\rangle]}\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : ceps}\\ ] ] this definition implies in fact a simple relation for @xmath17 , @xmath18 thus , all np effects which may enter the present analysis of the ut are parameterized in terms of four real coefficients , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    due to",
    "the limited available number of constraints , we now make the hypothesis that np effects can appear ( at least to a large extent ) only in one of the three mixing amplitudes .",
    "this is the only restrictive assumption we make in this analysis . clearly , this hypothesis is not valid in several specific models , as for instance in the minimal flavour violating susy models  @xcite in which np effects simultaneously appear in all the mixing amplitudes but with coefficients which are related one to the other .",
    "the result from the fit is : @xmath23~ \\rm{at}~95\\% ~c.l .",
    "\\label{eq : cepsk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the value is compatible with unity but the distribution is rather broad .",
    "thus , in this respect , large np contributions to @xmath8 mixing are still allowed .",
    "we note , however , that the experimental constraint coming from @xmath17 can only determine the product @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the large width of the distribution of @xmath22 simply reflects the uncertainty existing on the hadronic parameter @xmath25 .",
    "we also find that , in this scenario , the distributions of the other ut parameters ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , sin2@xmath4 , @xmath28 ) are not really different from those obtained using the sm parameterization ( @xmath29 ) .        the value of @xmath30 peaks at 1 .",
    "however , it is not limited from above due to the fact the @xmath32 is not yet determined . also in this case ,",
    "the distributions of the other ut parameters are not really different from those obtained using the sm parameterization ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "finally we explore the possibility of np contributions in @xmath34 mixing .",
    "figure [ fig : cd ] shows the distributions of @xmath35 and @xmath20 . is determined from the measurement of @xmath36 up to a discrete ambiguity , @xmath37 . in figure",
    "[ fig : cd ] only one of the two determinations ( the one containing @xmath38 ) is shown for clarity . ]",
    "we see that two solutions are possible in this case .",
    "the first one peaks around the sm solution , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the second one represents instead the possibility of a really distinct np contribution .",
    "the presence of two solutions corresponds to the fact that , as shown in figure [ fig : cd2 ] , the constraint from @xmath17 intercepts the circle defined by @xmath41 in two regions .",
    "the region on the quadrant with positive value of @xmath42 corresponds to the sm solution .",
    "the presence of these two solutions is also visible in several distributions of the ut parameters shown in figure [ fig:1d_angle_cd ] .",
    "as can be seen from these plots , in order to discriminate between the two solutions , an independent determination of either @xmath26 , as obtained for instance from the study of the ratio @xmath43 of radiative @xmath44 decays , or @xmath0 would be necessary . the np solution has been also recently discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we want to conclude this discussion with a comment concerning the  naturalness \" of this  np solution \" .",
    "first , we observe that np , though possible , is certainly not required in order to explain the results of the ut analysis . in addition , suppose that the np solution in @xmath34 mixing is indeed the correct one .",
    "then it is somewhat surprising to find that in the sm , i.e. in the ",
    "wrong \" theory of @xmath34 mixing , the predicted values of @xmath45 and sin2@xmath4 actually select in the ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) plane just one of the two regions which are also allowed by the other constraints , namely @xmath46 and @xmath17 . in this sense",
    ", the consistency of this np solution would be accidental .",
