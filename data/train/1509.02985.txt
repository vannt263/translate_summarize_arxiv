    "electromagnetic ( em ) waves in the 0.310  thz frequency range are thought to have great potential in research and industry  @xcite ; thus , compact , solid - state , and continuous wave ( cw ) terahertz sources have been developed in the field of semiconductors and lasers  @xcite .",
    "presently , quantum cascade lasers , which emit radiation at frequencies greater than 1.45  thz and must be cooled to 37  k  @xcite , are of particular interest .",
    "room - temperature terahertz sources based on resonant tunneling diodes can generate frequencies up to 1.31  thz  @xcite but emission power greater than 1  mw is presently not possible .",
    "intense , continuous , and broadly - tunable terahertz generation from high transition temperature ( high-@xmath2 ) superconductor bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( bi-2212 ) has attracted the attention of experimenters and theoreticians  @xcite .",
    "dc voltage @xmath3 applied to the stack of intrinsic josephson junctions ( ijjs )  @xcite in single crystal bi-2212 leads to ac current and concomitant terahertz emission at the josephson frequency  @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the elementary charge , planck s constant , and the number of active ijjs , respectively .    to generate intense terahertz waves ,",
    "several tens of micron - sized mesa structures are milled out of bi-2212 . according to the electromagnetism for the microstrip antenna  @xcite",
    ", the transverse magnetic ( tm ) mode is excited at the resonance frequency : in the case of a rectangular mesa , @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the speed of light in vacuum , the dielectric constant , and the width and length of the mesa , respectively .",
    "the emitted far - field waves are polarized with their e - field parallel to the plane that contains the wave vector of the standing em wave in the mesa cavity .",

    "( 2 ) correspond to the number of line nodes of the tm ( @xmath13 ) mode standing wave . in most cases using long rectangular mesas ,",
    "the tm ( @xmath14 ) mode with formation of the standing wave along the width of the mesa at @xmath15 has been observed  @xcite .",
    "the similar collective resonance - like behavior along the length was found in laser microscopy  @xcite , which , however , is not direct evidence for the cavity resonance . to our knowledge , there still remains a lack of consensus on the issue on the cavity resonance condition .",
    "moreover , broadly tunable emissions obscure the role of the internal cavity resonance  @xcite . to correctly identify the excited modes",
    ", the emitted integral wave has to be collected using lenses or mirrors with small f number because the far - field emission patterns are affected by the excited mode  @xcite .",
    "a complete study of the cavity resonance will help to better understand the mechanisms of coherent emission from the ijj stack , which will make possible to control the polarization of the emitted wave and may facilitate the design of cw terahertz sources for coherent communication applications . in this study , we show that various cavity modes with different ( @xmath13 ) can be excited using an identical stack of ijjs by changing the bias condition .",

    "the bolometric signal was calibrated separately using a sub - millimeter power meter . for the lock - in detection ,",
    "the emitted em waves were optically chopped at 80  hz . to collect the emitted integral waves , we used hemispherical silicon and plastic lenses and an off - axis parabolic mirror , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the collimation effect owing to the silicon lens is described in detail in the appendix a. note that the estimated solid angle of the detection window of 0.6  sr is more than 20 times larger than that in previous experiments ; therefore , we can directly measure the total emission power from the sample . at the focal point of the parabolic mirror",

    "three bias points at 0.92 , 1.11 , and 1.26  v correspond to the emission peaks at tm ( @xmath28 ) , ( @xmath29 ) , and ( @xmath30 ) , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath25 for the rightmost peak of tm ( @xmath31 ) can not be obtained properly because the bias point around 1.35  v is less stable to the bias scan .",
    "the dashed line represents the josephson relation @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is obtained from the least squares fit to the experimental data .",
    "this @xmath7-value is consistent with the value of 850 that is separately obtained from the height of the stack .",
    "according to the josephson relation , the bias voltage can be directly converted into the emission frequency .",
    "for instance , the application of 1.00 v voltage to the @xmath34 ijj stack corresponds to a frequency of 0.568  thz .",
    "hence , the plot of the emission power versus @xmath24 can be assumed to be equivalent to the resonance spectrum .",
    "this assumption is supported by the fact that the observed @xmath25 corresponds exactly to @xmath35 within instrumental error ( see fig .",
    "most importantly , because we make appropriate use of the collecting lenses , the behavior of the bolometer signal is commensurate with the emitted integral power although we neglect the light loss owing to the fresnel reflections at the lens surfaces .",

    "we observe that the emission power has local maximum at each @xmath43 and its peak height varies depending on ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the slight difference between calculated @xmath43 and observed peaks of emission power arises from the typical 510% difference in the top and bottom lengths of the actual stack due to the trapezoidal cross section .",

    "this observed behavior is consistent with the simulation results , which is discussed later .",
    "note that the tm ( @xmath14 ) mode can not be identified in fig .  4 , since the resonance voltage of @xmath44  v falls short of the applicable voltage range .     for @xmath33 .",

    "an effective @xmath46-value can be estimated from @xmath47 ; for example , @xmath48 at @xmath49  k. the observed low-@xmath46 cavity resonance suggests that the broadening effect of the emission is independent of the angle of the sidewall inclination in the mesa but is caused by the impedance mismatching .",
    "moreover , a mixing experiment showed a 23  mhz spectral linewidth at the minimum  @xcite . with careful consideration of the minimum resolution limit of 0.75  ghz of the ft - ir spectrometer  @xcite , a @xmath46-value in the order of 10@xmath5010@xmath51",

    "the temperature distribution in the emitting stack is inhomogeneous due to the enormous local heating  @xcite .",
    "this would lead to a shorten length of the internal cavity  @xcite . nevertheless , the overall peak structure in fig .",
    "4 is insensitive to @xmath21 , which implies that the effective cavity condition including @xmath11 , @xmath20 , and @xmath53 is nearly independent of @xmath21 in the measurement range .",
    "we use the commercial simulator sonnet  @xcite to analyze the experimental result in terms of the cavity condition . by using the method of moments with sonnet",

    "the current density at the patch surface can also be calculated by substituting the em field into maxwell s equations .",

    "the patch is surrounded by electrical grounding 5 @xmath17 m apart from the edges , which is consistent with the actual situation ( see the image in the inset of fig .",
    "the em feeding point with an area of @xmath59@xmath555  @xmath56m@xmath57 is set near the center of the patch .",
