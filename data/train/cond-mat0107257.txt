    "due to the presence of strong electron correlations , simple explanations of spectral features within an independent - particle model may fail . here",
    "we try to clarify what physical quantity is really measured and what ingredients are needed for a theoretical approach to find a satisfactory agreement with the experimental data . we are concerned with the theory of four basic types of electron spectroscopy ( see fig .  [",

    "the spin- , angle- and energy - resolved ( ultraviolet ) valence - band photoemission ( pes ) more or less directly measures the occupied part of the band structure .",
    "present theories of pes are mostly based on the so - called one - step model of photoemission @xcite which treats the initial excitation step , the transport of the photoelectron to the surface and the scattering at the surface barrier as a single quantum - mechanically coherent process .",
    "the one - step model is essentially based on the independent - particle approximation .",
    "the valence electrons move independently in an effective potential as obtained from band - structure calculations within the local - density approximation ( lda ) of density - functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "there are recent attempts @xcite for a reformulation of the one - step model to include a non - local , complex and energy - dependent self - energy which accounts for electron correlations .",
    "the one - step model also applies to inverse photoemission spectroscopy .",
    "ipe is complementary to pes and yields information on the unoccupied bands above the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "for example , ipe can be used to determine the dispersions of the rydberg - like series of surface states in the @xmath0 image potential in front of the surface @xcite .",
    "the theory of cvv auger - electron spectroscopy ( aes ) is more complicated compared to pes / ipe since there are two valence electrons participating in the transition . due to core state involved additionally , aes is highly element specific .",
    "this feature is frequently exploited for surface characterization .",
    "contrary to @xmath1 resolved ( inverse ) photoemission , the auger transition is more or less localized in real space .",
    "high - resolution aes may thus yield valuable information on the local valence density of states ( dos ) . in the most simple theoretical approach suggested by lander in 1953 @xcite , the auger spectrum is given by the self - convolution of the occupied part of the dos .",

    "its comparatively simple experimental setup and its surface sensitivity qualifies aps to study surface magnetism , for example . for a ferromagnetic material ,",
    "the spin dependence of the ap signal obtained by using a polarized electron beam gives an estimate of the surface magnetization as has been demonstrated for the transition metals fe and ni @xcite .",
    "common to all four spectroscopies are a number of fundamental concepts and approximation schemes used in the theoretical description .",
    "therefore , it should be possible to develop the basic theory of pes , ipe , aes and aps within a unified framework .",
    "this is discussed in the following section [ sec : specs ] . as a result of this basic theory of electron spectroscopies it found that in each case the intensity is essentially given in terms of a characteristic green function .",
    "the actual evaluation of the green function is more specific and depends on the respective spectroscopy , on the material and the physical question to be investigated . in section [ sec : ferro ] we will therefore pick up an example and give a more detailed discussion of aps for band ferro - magnets .    a notable quality of aps is its direct sensitivity to electron correlations : in the ap transition , two valence electrons are added to the system at a certain lattice site .",
    "these final - state electrons mutually experience the strong intra - atomic coulomb interaction @xmath5 . as a consequence",
    "the two - particle ( ap ) excitation spectrum is expected to show up a pronounced spectral - weight transfer or even a satellite with a characteristic energy of the order of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this is an important difference between the one- ( pes , ipe ) and the two - particle spectroscopies ( aes , aps ) . to demonstrate this sensitivity to correlations in aps we consider the spin- and temperature - dependent ap spectra of ferromagnetic nickel as a prototype of a strongly correlated and band - ferromagnetic material in section [ sec : ni ]",

    "the calculated data are shifted by 852.3  ev such that onset of the un - broadened spectrum for @xmath138 coincides with the maximum of @xmath133 emission in the experiment ( dotted line ) .",
    "[ fig : aps ] and also a more detailed inspection show that the secondary peak at @xmath143  ev is not affected by correlations at all .",
    "this is consistent with observed temperature independence of the peak and with the fact that the dos has mainly @xmath8-@xmath154 character at the discontinuity deriving from the @xmath144 critical point .",
    "the maximum of the secondary peak is therefore used as a reference to normalize the measured spectra for each temperature .",
    "what are the signatures of electron correlations ?",
    "the indirect correlations manifest themselves as a renormalization of the one - particle dos . here",
    ", they are responsible in first place for the correct temperature dependence of the intensity asymmetry of the main peak in the ap spectrum .",
    "details are discussed in refs .",
    "the the direct interaction between the two additional final - state electrons and thus the direct correlations are much more important for aps . to estimate this effect , fig .",
    "[ fig : aps ] ( right ) also displays the results of the self - convolution model for comparison ( still including matrix elements as well as the fully interacting one - particle dos ) .",
    "looking at the results of the ladder approximation , the overall agreement with the measurements is rather satisfying . except for the lowest temperature the intensity , the spin splitting and the spin asymmetry of the main peak",
    "are well reproduced and , consistent with the experiment , a negligibly small intensity asymmetry and spin splitting is predicted for the secondary peak .",
    "however , switching off the direct correlations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aps ] , right ) , results in a strong overestimation of the main peak structure .",
    "a plausible qualitative explanation of this pronounced correlation effect can given within the cini - sawatzky theory : for low hole density the main effect of the direct correlations is known to transfer spectral weight to lower energies inaccessible to aps .",
    "this weight shows up again in the ( complementary ) auger spectrum ( recall that aps and aes are described by the same green function ) .",
    "hypothetically , for @xmath164 all weight would be taken by a satellite split off at the lower boundary of the auger spectrum @xcite .",
    "a considerable weight transfer is in fact seen in aes @xcite .    .",

    "their importance for a quantitative understanding of spin - resolved aps can be demonstrated by setting @xmath165 for @xmath166 or @xmath167 , respectively , ( see below ) and comparing with the results of the full theory .",
    "their energy dependence ( via the energy dependence of @xmath168 ) is weak over a few ev at energies of the order of kev and can not explain the difference between ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : tme ] .",
    "the main difference is rather a consequence of the fact that the radial @xmath137 core wave function has a stronger overlap with the ( more localized ) @xmath82 as compared to the ( more de - localized ) @xmath169 radial wave functions .",
    "this implies a suppression of the @xmath8-@xmath154 contributions to the orbital sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : int ] ) . the features above @xmath170  ev",
    "originate from additional discontinuities of the @xmath8-@xmath154-like dos ( as for the peak at @xmath143  ev ) .",
    "for @xmath171 the spin asymmetry of the spectrum is mainly due to the spin dependence of the green function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : int ] ) . if the calculation of the matrix elements ( [ eq : tme ] ) starts from the _ spin - polarized _",
    "l(s)da potential , an additional spin asymmetry is observed resulting from the spin dependence of the states in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tme ] ) .",
    "this , however , is small and has practically no influence on the results .    on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ fig : tme ] shows a strong suppression of the intensity asymmetry at high energies when taking matrix elements into account .",
    "this effect is controlled by the symmetry of the matrix @xmath172 . in the antisymmetric case ,",
    "@xmath173 ( @xmath174 ) , there is a maximum spin asymmetry ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tme ] ) while , even for a ferromagnet , there is no spin asymmetry at all for the symmetric case , as discussed in section [ sec : ferro ] .",
    "the results of the full calculation along eq .",
    "( [ eq : tme ] ) are neither fully symmetric nor antisymmetric with respect to @xmath175 , @xmath176 .",
    "it has been shown that the basic theory of different electron spectroscopies , pes , ipe , aes and aps , can be developed within a unified framework . starting from fermi s golden rule and employing the sudden approximation ,",
    "the intensity can be expressed in terms of a one- or two - particle green function including electron - photon or coulomb matrix elements , respectively . citing aps from the typical band ferromagnet ni as an example",
    ", it could be demonstrated that a quantitative agreement with spin - resolved and temperature - dependent measured spectra can be achieved when the basic spectroscopic formula is taken seriously and is evaluated by modern techniques of solid - state theory .",
    "in particular , it has been demonstrated that there are pronounced ( direct ) correlation effects in the ap line shape of ni . while @xmath8-@xmath154 derived features at higher energies appear to be sensitive to the geometrical structure only , the main peak is strongly affected by the direct interaction between the two additional final - state electrons .",
    "consistent with the cini - sawatzky model and consistent with the well - known ni auger spectrum , there is a considerable spectral - weight transfer to energies below the threshold . for co and fe one can even expect stronger effects of @xmath92-@xmath92 correlations on the ap line shape since the @xmath92-hole density is larger than in ni .",
    "simple self - convolution models neglecting the direct correlations must be questioned seriously .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that a mere computation of the ( two - particle ) green function is insufficient to describe spin - resolved aps .",
    "the spin asymmetry of the ap signal is found to be mainly determined by the orbital - dependent transition - matrix elements and their transformation behavior under exchange of the orbital quantum numbers .",
    "considering the temperature dependence of the spectra and the magnetic order resulting from strong ( indirect ) correlations in addition , one can state that the ap line shape of a typical ferromagnetic @xmath82 transition metal is determined by a rather complex interplay of different factors .",
    "despite the fact that a reasonable understanding of aps from ni has been achieved , there is much work to be done in the future : an open question concerns the importance of core - hole effects in aps , for example . for the present case",
    "there has been no need to consider scattering at the core - hole potential in the final state .",
    "this may likely be different for systems with a smaller @xmath82 occupancy .",
    "furthermore , one must recognize that even the determination of the valence - band green function is a central problem of many - body theory .",
    "recently much progress has been achieved to deal with single - band models @xcite ; for a quantitative interpretation of electron spectra from transition metals , however , one needs a theory that realistically includes orbital degeneracy and @xmath177-@xmath92 hybridization from the very beginning .",
    "compared to perturbation theory or lowest - order re - summation of diagrams , as employed here , improvements are conceivable and necessary albeit not easily performed .",
