    "understanding the macroscopic state of a system of interacting bosons at zero temperature is of interest to the solution of a number of problems in condensed matter physics@xcite .",
    "the theory of superconductivity is built on cooper pairs which can be treated as bosons .",
    "mapping of flux - lines in type - ii superconductors to a two - dimensional ( 2d ) bosonic system has led to a deeper understanding of the i - v characteristics of cuprate superconductors@xcite .",
    "more recently , the realization of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in dilute atomic alkali gases has provided an experimental means to systematically explore various types of macroscopic quantum states and transitions between them , enriching our knowledge about equilibrium and dynamic properties of strongly correlated quantum systems@xcite .",
    "previously , it has been established that repulsive bosons in restricted geometries ( such as those confined by an optical lattice ) may undergo a zero - temperature quantum phase transition from a superfluid state to a mott insulator state as the strength of the interaction is increased@xcite .",
    "the superfluid state is characterized by its well - known off - diagonal long - range order and a finite phase rigidity , whereas the mott insulator state is characterized by zero compressibility and gapped particle excitations .",
    "transition between the two gives over to intervening states ( e.g. , bose glass or mott glass ) when disorder , either in the form of random on - site potential or random hopping coefficients are introduced@xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on a different type of disorder , i.e. , random phase frustration on the ground state properties of a 2d interacting bosonic system",
    ". such a situation has been realized experimentally in positionally disordered josephson junction arrays , where the frustration can be tuned by varying the strength of a transverse magnetic field@xcite . at sufficiently strong disorder",
    ", it has been suggested that the superfluid state changes into a new state of matter , the `` phase glass '' phase@xcite .",
    "although the existence of such a state is not much disputed , its precise physical properties have not been well established@xcite .    the classical limit of the above problem can be described by a 2d xy model with random phase shifts@xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of the classical model has been worked out by nattermann _ et al._@xcite using renormalization group methods",
    ". when the frustration is weak , only a small number of localized and tightly bound vortex - antivortex pairs are present in the classical ground state , so that long - ranged phase order is preserved at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "however , as the frustration exceeds a certain critical value , the ground state becomes unstable against free vortex excitations due to a large distance instability@xcite .",
    "consequently , vortices and antivortices proliferate and destroy the ordered state at all temperatures .",
    "the gauge glass model represents an extreme case where the random frustration attains its maximum strength@xcite . despite extensive studies by a number of groups@xcite , the low temperature properties of the 2d model are still controversial . at the heart of the discussion",
    "is whether a certain form of glass rigidity survives despite the presence of a finite density of free vortices in the system .",
    "numerical simulations of the gauge glass model have yielded contradictory conclusions with regard to a finite temperature glass transition . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have carried out an explicit analysis of vortex configurations in the ground and low - lying excited states of a corresponding coulomb gas model , where the random frustration is represented by a set of randomly oriented dipoles which interact with the vortices@xcite .",
    "the main conclusion of the analysis is that , unlike the case of an ising spin glass , the ground state of the 2d coulomb gas in the random dipolar field is quite unique .",
    "the low - lying excited vortex states can be described in terms of a dilute gas of localized vortex - antivortex pairs super - imposed on a complex and critical but otherwise innocent ground state vortex configuration . due to the disorder , the density of states of these pairs is finite at zero excitation energy . consequently , these pairs are able to participate in dielectric screening under thermal equilibrium conditions .",
    "renormalization group arguments show that the ground state of the gauge glass is a critical state with a phase rigidity that decays algebraically with distance .",
    "thermal excitations of low energy vortex - antivortex pairs at temperature @xmath3 lead to a finite correlation length @xmath4 which diverges as @xmath3 tends to zero .",
    "these predictions are confirmed by direct monte carlo simulations of the gauge glass model .",
    "since the power - law decay of phase rigidity with distance @xmath5 requires dielectric screening by excited vortex - antivortex pairs of size comparable to @xmath5 and the corresponding vortex movement at smaller scales , it is legitimate to ask if such a complex relaxation process can be realized in dynamic simulations and experiments .",
    "the slow dynamics for the creation and annhilation of distant vortex - antivortex pairs may indeed give rise to an apparent phase rigidity bigger than its equilibrium value .",
    "it is plausible that this type of glassy behavior is responsible for the previously reported finite temperature transition@xcite , though one needs to work out the relevant energy and time scales for a detailed verification of this scenario .",
    "quantum fluctuations of the phase lower the core energy of vortices and antivortices and facilitate their delocalization through quantum tunneling . sufficiently strong fluctuations of this type destroy long - ranged phase ordering as in the pure case , giving rise to the mott insulator state . in the following",
    "we present detailed numerical results to show that , when the fluctuations are weak , the ground state of the system retains phase rigidity both in space and in time as in the classical case .",
    "this phase glass phase is characterized by a finite edwards - anderson order parameter , a finite compressibility , but a vanishing superfluid density or helicity modulus .",
    "we also carry out a scaling analysis of the transition to the mott insulator state .",
    "our results for various critical exponents are significantly different from those of the pure case , suggesting that the phase glass to the mott insulator transition belongs to a different universality class than the three - dimensional ( 3d ) xy model@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "since the algorithm allows the system to explore configurations over a broad range of values of the classical action ( [ path_h1 ] ) in a single simulation , it has a better chance to generate statistically independent samples for the calculation of thermal averages , which may become a problem for conventional monte carlo methods in the glass phase .",
