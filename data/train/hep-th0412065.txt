    "in this paper we consider the model of spinning particle @xcite which is based on the kerr rotating black hole solution and has a reach spinor , twistor and stringy structures .",
    "the inspired by strings and twistors methods have led to the strong progress in computation of some scattering amplitudes @xcite . in",
    "the recent paper @xcite witten suggested a ` twistor - string ' which may be an element of the structure of fundamental particles . we show that a version of the ` twistor - string ' is presented in the kerr spinning particle .",
    "* twistors * may be considered as the lightlike world - lines @xcite .",
    "the lightlike momentum @xmath2 may be represented in the spinor form @xmath3 twistor is a generalization of the spinor which is necessary for description of the null word - lines carrying an angular momentum , @xmath4 with @xmath5 .",
    "it contains two extra spinor components @xmath6 .",
    "the set @xmath7 , or the equivalent set @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a projective spinor , may also be considered as twistors .    * black hole which is neither ` black ' nor ` hole ' * - this joke by p. townsend has direct relation to the kerr spinning particle .",
    "the ratio angular momentum / mass , @xmath10 , for spinning particles is very high and the black - hole horizons disappear revealing the naked singular ring which is the branch line of the kerr space on the physical and ` mirror ' sheets .",
    "the strings and twistors going through the kerr ring pass into a ` mirror ' world and look as semi - infinite . in @xcite a model of spinning particle was suggested , where the quantum electromagnetic excitations of the kerr ring generate the spin and mass . it was recognized that the kerr ring is a closed string with traveling waves @xcite , and excitations of the kerr ring lead to the appearance of the extra _ axial _ stringy system consisting of two semi - infinite singular strings of opposite chiralities @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ kout ] .",
    "= 2.1 in    these excitations generate the chiral traveling waves along the axial semistrings , and the dirac spinor @xmath11 describes in the weyl basis an interplay of two axial traveling waves of opposite chiralities @xcite .",
    "this axial stringy system plays important role in the formation of the third stringy structure , the _ complex _ twistor - string .",
    "* basic properties of the kerr spinning particle : *    * anomalous gyromagnetic ratio @xmath0 as that of the dirac electron , * twistorial and stringy structures , * mass and spin of the particle appear from electromagnetic excitations of the kerr ring ( traveling waves ) - the wheeler s ` geon ' , * compton region is structured by the kerr circular string .",
    "* dirac equation describes traveling waves on two axial semistrings .",
    "a few properties may also have relation to foundations of quantum theory :    - wave function has a physical carrier - the axial stringy system .",
    "- axial string may control the motion of particle due to a topological coupling to circular string , which reproduce the old de broglie conjecture .",
    "- the quantum property - absence of radiation by oscillations - is exhibited here at the classical level due to the twofoldedness of the kerr space : the loss of energy on the ` physical ' sheet of space is compensated by ingoing radiation from the ` mirror ' sheet .    besides , there are the relations to the skirme and chiral bag models : the kerr congruence is a twisting generalization of the ` hedgehog ' ansatz .",
    "in the * kerr - schild formalism * @xcite metric has the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the metric of minkowski space , @xmath14 and @xmath15 is a vortex of the null field which is tangent to the kerr s congruence of twistors @xmath16 which is determined by the * kerr theorem*@xcite .",
    "congruence of twistors , a geodesic family of null rays , covers the kerr space twice ( see figures in @xcite . ) two axial semistrings @xmath17 and @xmath18 are created by two twistors corresponding to @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the complex kerr string appears naturally in the newman - initiated _ complex representation _ of the kerr geometry @xcite which is generated by a complex world - line @xmath21 the complex time @xmath22 forms a stringy world - sheet @xcite .",
    "the real fields on the real space - time @xmath23 are determined via a complex retarded - time construction , where the vectors @xmath24 have to satisfy the complex light - cone constraints @xmath25 .",
    "this allows one to select two families of twistors : left ( holomorphic ) @xmath26 and right ( antiholomorphic ) @xmath27    in the kerr case @xmath28 and the complex retarded - time equation @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the kerr complex radial distance and @xmath31 is an angular direction of twistor ) shows that on the real space @xmath32 therefore , the light - cone constrains select a strip on @xmath33 plane , @xmath34 $ ] , and the complex world - sheet acquires the boundary , forming _ an open string _",
    "@xmath35      this string is similar to the well known @xmath36 string @xcite . in @xmath37",
    "it has only the chiral left modes @xmath38 , while the complex conjugate string has only right ones , @xmath39 by imbedding this string into the real space - time , the left and right structures are identified by orientifolding the world - sheet @xcite .",
    "the resulting string describes a massive particle and has a broken n=2 supersymmetry .",
    "its target space is equivalent to ` diagonal ' of @xmath1 .",
