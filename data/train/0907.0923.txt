    "nuclear density - functional - theory ( dft ) , with the most prominent representatives being skyrme - hartree - fock ( shf ) , the gogny forces , and the relativistic mean - field model , achieved a high level of quality in the description of ground state and dynamics of atomic nuclei @xcite .",
    "most applications for nuclear dynamics up to now have been concerned with electrical excitation modes ( natural parity ) .",
    "the description works generally well , except for some persistent problems with the isovector giant resonance ( gr ) in light nuclei @xcite .",
    "much less work has been done yet for magnetic excitations ( unnatural parity ) . at the same time , magnetic modes are sensitive to a different class of force parameters , namely those related to spin .",
    "an exploration of magnetic resonances , like spin - flip m1 , could essentially improve the spin - orbit interaction . magnetic modes could clarify the role of still vague tensor interaction @xcite . also , the spin - flip m1 resonance is a counterpart of the spin - isospin gamow - teller resonance which is of great current interest in connection with astrophysical problems @xcite .",
    "investigation of the m1 resonance could be useful in this connection as well .",
    "there are many studies of the spin - flip m1 mode within simple models beyond the dft , see e.g. reviews @xcite . at the same time ,",
    "as far as we know , a dft treatment is limited to a few publications using shf @xcite and even that is not carried through fully consistently . the work @xcite uses a hybrid model with partial inclusion of shf in the landau - migdal formulation @xcite .",
    "the other study @xcite uses the early skyrme forces and omits the crucial spin density . these studies , being a useful first step , are not satisfactory for nowadays demands .",
    "the present study aims at a fully self - consistent description of the spin - flip m1 mode in the framework of shf .",
    "previous investigations for gamow - teller @xcite and spin - flip m1 modes @xcite hint that spin - density response could be decisive to get a sizeable collective shift .",
    "so all the skyrme terms with spin density ( usually omitted in calculations for electric modes ) have to be implemented and scrutinized . furthermore , because of the obvious importance of spin - orbit splitting , the responses delivered by spin - orbit and tensor interactions have to be inspected as well .",
    "since the quality of the description may depend on the particular skyrme parameterization as well as on nuclear shape and mass region , a variety of parameterizations should be checked for light and heavy , spherical and deformed nuclei .",
    "note that the m1 mode in heavy open - shell nuclei ( rare - earth and actinides ) exhibits a pronounced double - peak structure @xcite while closed - shell nuclei ( @xmath0ca , @xmath2pb , ... ) show only one peak @xcite .",
    "all these demands are met in the present study which , to the best of our knowledge , is the first systematic and self - consistent shf exploration of spin - flip m1 .",
    "we will consider the resonance in the doubly - magic nuclei @xmath0ca and @xmath2pb and axially deformed nuclei @xmath1gd and @xmath3u .",
    "a representative set of eight shf parameterizations is used : skt6 @xcite , sko @xcite , sko @xcite , sg2 @xcite , skm * @xcite , sly6 @xcite , ski4 @xcite , and sv - bas @xcite .",
    "they exhibit a variety of effective masses ( from @xmath4=1 in skt6 down to 0.65 in ski4 ) and other nuclear matter characteristics .",
    "some of the forces ( sly6 ) were found favorable in the description of e1(t=1 ) gr @xcite .",
    "others were used in studies of gamow - teller strength ( sg2 , sko ) @xcite or peculiarities of spin - orbit splitting ( ski4 ) @xcite .",
    "the forces skt6 , sg2 and sko involve the tensor spin - orbit term . the parameterization sv - bas represents one of the latest upgrades in shf .",
    "the calculations are performed within the self - consistent separable random - phase - approximation ( srpa ) approach based on factorized skyrme residual interaction @xcite .",
    "the self - consistent factorization considerably reduces the computational expense of rpa while maintaining a high accuracy .",
    "this allows to perform systematic studies in both spherical and deformed ( heavy and super - heavy ) nuclei @xcite .",
    "the residual interaction includes all contributions arising from the shf functional as well as the coulomb ( direct and exchange ) and pairing ( at bcs level ) terms @xcite ) .",
    "the skyrme energy density to be exploited reads @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the force parameters .",
    "this functional involves time - even ( nucleon @xmath10 , kinetic - energy @xmath11 , spin - orbit @xmath12 ) and time - odd ( current @xmath13 , spin @xmath14 , vector kinetic - energy @xmath15 ) densities where @xmath16 denotes protons and neutrons .",
    "densities without index , like @xmath17 , denote total densities .",
    "the contributions with @xmath6 ( i=0,1,2,3,4 ) and @xmath7 ( i=0,1,2,3 ) are the standard terms responsible for ground state properties and electric excitations of even - even nuclei @xcite . in the standard shf",
    ", the isovector spin - orbit interaction is linked to the isoscalar one by @xmath18 .",
    "the tensor spin - orbit terms @xmath19 are often skipped . in ( [ eq : skyrme_funct ] ) they can be switched by the parameter @xmath20 .",
    "the spin terms with @xmath21 become relevant only for odd nuclei and magnetic modes in even - even nuclei .",
    "though @xmath21 may be uniquely determined as functions of @xmath22 @xcite , their values were not yet well tested by nuclear data . moreover , following a strict dft , they can be considered as free parameters .",
    "just these spin terms may be of a paramount importance for the spin - slip m1 .",
    "hence all them are taken into account in srpa .",
    "in addition to second functional derivatives entering the srpa residual interaction for electric modes , @xmath23 the present treatment also involves the terms with @xmath24 srpa generators include spin and orbital input operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 with @xmath27 being 1 or @xmath28",
    ". in deformed nuclei , to take into account the coupling between spin and quadrupole @xmath29 states , the quadrupole generator @xmath30 is also added .",
    "the convergence of the results with including more generators was checked .",
    "see details in @xcite .",
    "the shf calculations employ a coordinate - space grid with the mesh size 0.7 fm . for deformed nuclei ,",
    "cylindrical coordinates are used and the equilibrium quadrupole deformation is found by minimization of the total energy @xcite .",
    "the single - particle spectrum involves all levels from the bottom of the mean field well up to + 20 mev . in the heaviest nucleus under consideration , @xmath31 , this results in @xmath3217000 two - quasiparticle ( 2qp ) @xmath29 pairs with the excitation energies up to 50 - 70 mev .",
    "note that for electric e1(t=1 ) and e2(t=0 ) excitations such single - particle space provides a satisfying exhaustion of the energy - weighted sum rules @xcite .",
    "the spectral distribution of the spin - flip m1 mode with @xmath29 is presented as the strength function @xmath33 where @xmath34 $ ] is a lorentz weight with the averaging parameter @xmath35=1 mev .",
    "such averaging width is found optimal for the comparison with experiment and simulation of broadening effects beyond srpa ( escape widths , coupling with complex configurations ) .",
    "further , @xmath36 is the ground state , @xmath37 runs over the rpa @xmath29 states with energies @xmath38 and wave functions @xmath39 .",
    "the operator of spin - flip m1 transition reads in standard notation as @xmath40 $ ] with spin g - factors @xmath41 and @xmath42 quenched by @xmath43=0.68 and @xmath44=0.64 .",
    "as we are interested in the spin - flip m1 , the orbital response is omitted , i.e. we put @xmath45 .",
    "note that in the experimental data @xcite used for the comparison , the orbital contribution is strongly suppressed .",
    "the strength function ( [ eq : strength_function ] ) is computed directly , i.e. without calculation of rpa states @xmath37 , which additionally reduces the computation effort @xcite .",
    "more details of srpa formalism are given in the appendices a , b , and c.",
    "in fig . 1 the collective shifts of the main resonance peak in @xmath0ca , @xmath2pb , @xmath1gd , and @xmath3u , obtained with different skyrme parameterizations , are shown .",
    "the shifts are defined as @xmath46 , i.e. as a difference in the energies of srpa and unperturbed two - quasiparticle m1 peaks .",
    "the 2qp strength is calculated by using ( [ eq : strength_function ] ) without the residual interaction .",
    "in addition to the total shift , the contributions from different spin - density dependent terms as well as from the tensor force ( for skt6 , sg2 and sko ) are shown .",
    "it is seen that the total collective shifts are generally modest and vary from 1 - 2 mev in @xmath0ca to 0.5 - 2 mev in @xmath2pb and 0.5 - 1.5 mev in @xmath1gd and @xmath3u .",
    "the low value emerges from contributions pulling in different directions .",
    "this holds for the separate shifts from @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( not disentangled here ) .",
    "the @xmath49-term gives a negative shift in contrast to the positive one from @xmath50 .",
    "anyway the contribution from @xmath50 usually dominates thus giving the total upshift in accordance with isovector character of the resonance .",
    "all the forces give generally similar results .",
    "note a sizable contribution of the tensor interaction for skt6 and sg2 .",
    "for sko this contribution is negligible , except for @xmath0ca where it is so strong that gives a negative total @xmath51 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the non - spin contributions ( with @xmath52 ) alone do not provide any collective shift and leave the m1 strength unperturbed .",
    "the whole shift is produced by the spin - dependent terms @xmath53 .",
    "the calculations give a reasonable summed b(m1 ) strength . in the interval 0 - 45",
    "mev the unperturbed strength is 3.2 and 18.4 - 18.6 @xmath54 in @xmath0ca and @xmath2pb .",
    "the residual interaction changes these values and we have 2.5 - 4.8 @xmath54 in @xmath0ca and 14.8 - 17.3 @xmath54 in @xmath2pb as compared with experimental values @xmath32 5.3 @xmath54 @xcite and @xmath32 17.9 @xmath54 @xcite , respectively . note a strong collective effect in @xmath0ca .",
    "it is well known that proton and neutron spin - orbit splittings @xmath55 represent another crucial ingredient in description of spin - flip m1 mode @xcite .",
    "usually @xmath56 which leads in rare - earth and actinide nuclei to a two - peak structure of the resonance with dominant proton ( neutron ) origin of the lower ( upper ) peak .",
    "this is demonstrated for @xmath3u in fig .",
    "2a ) where the proton and neutron components of the m1 mode , obtained with @xmath43=0.68 , @xmath44=0 and @xmath43=0 , @xmath44=0.64 , respectively , are shown . panels b)-d ) exhibit proton and neutron splittings @xmath55 for different skyrme forces .",
    "the splittings are evaluated from centroids of the proton and neutron peaks of the unperturbed m1 strength .",
    "the results strongly depend on the parameterization . in most of the cases",
    "we have @xmath56 with @xmath571 - 2 mev but ski4 , sko and sko give very close splittings with even @xmath58 for ski4 and sko .",
    "the latter is related with a low value of @xmath59 and nonzero value of @xmath60 in ski4 .",
    "note that the experimental proton - neutron splitting in m1 gross structure is @xmath61 mev in @xmath1gd and @xmath3u @xcite and zero in @xmath2pb @xcite .    in fig .",
    "3 the srpa m1 strength function ( [ eq : strength_function ] ) in spherical doubly - magic nuclei @xmath0ca and @xmath2pb is presented . in @xmath0ca ,",
    "the resonance is produced only by neutron spin - flip transition @xmath62 yielding the one - peak structure .",
    "this feature is correctly reproduced by all the parameterizations .",
    "however , most of them underestimate the resonance energy ( with worst sko case because of the strong and possibly wrong tensor contribution ) and only the forces sly6 , ski4 , and skm * ( with maximal @xmath63 ) give the m1 energy close to experiment .",
    "the success of these forces is obviously determined by a suitable neutron spin - orbit splitting .",
    "however , the same figure shows that in @xmath2pb the forces sly6 , ski4 , and skm * considerably overestimate the m1 energy while the best result is achieved by sko .",
    "note that only sko , sko and ski4 , all having a small @xmath64 , give a one - peak resonance structure in accordance with experiment @xcite .",
    "this is because only for these parameterizations the interaction energy ( @xmath65 collective shift ) is larger than @xmath64 and so a significant mixture of proton and neutron components with forming of a one - peak resonance becomes possible .",
    "the other forces have too large @xmath64 and produce the two - peak structure .",
    "this demonstrates the great importance of the interplay between the residual interaction and relative proton and neutron spin - orbit splitting @xmath64 for the description of spin - flip m1",
    ".    figs . 4 and 5 present srpa results for deformed @xmath1gd and @xmath3u . here",
    ", in contrast to @xmath2pb , the experiment yields a double - peak structure and so the one - peak picture from sko , sko , and ski4 fails .",
    "the description is generally quite poor , with exception of sv - bas in @xmath1gd and sg2 in @xmath3u .",
    "thus we see that any skyrme parameterization fails to describe simultaneously the one - peak structure in closed - shell nuclei and two - peak structure in open - shell nuclei .",
    "the reason is yet unclear .",
    "however , the relative spin - orbit splitting @xmath64 is evidently one of the key factor and it is important to find a way to control it .",

    "6 explores the influence of the spin - orbit contributions by systematic variation of tensor spin - orbit ( panel a ) and isovector spin - orbit terms ( panel b ) .",
    "variation of the tensor spin - orbit strength shifts significantly both @xmath70 and @xmath71 while leaving the relative order unchanged .",
    "but the variation of the isovector spin - orbit strength @xmath60 has a strong effect on the relative positions .",
    "so by simultaneous monitoring tensor and isovector spin - orbit interactions one may control better the spin - orbit splittings .",
    "besides the strong effect on single - particle energies , these interactions also affect the collective shifts ( see fig .",
    "altogether they represent very promising tool for further improvement of the description of spin - flip m1 modes .",
    "we have studied the ability of skyrme forces to describe the spin - flip m1 resonance using rpa with self - consistent factorized residual interaction .",
    "the results show that the terms with spin and spin - orbit densities are responsible for a sizable collective shift of the resonance peak .",
    "the spin - orbit splitting of the underlying two - quasiparticle states is of crucial importance for the final pattern of the spectrum ( single - peak versus double - peak structure ) .",
    "the residual interaction tends to mix of proton and neutron spin - orbit partners and so works towards a one - peak structure , as in @xmath2pb .",
    "however , a large difference between neutron and proton spin - orbit splitting inhibits this mixing and produces two distinct proton and neutron peaks , as seen experimentally in rare - earth and actinide nuclei .",
    "none of eight skyrme parameterizations used in the present study is able to describe simultaneously the one - peak and two - peak structures in closed - shell and open - shell nuclei . in most of the cases ,",
    "the resonance energies are badly reproduced as well .",
    "a first exploration indicates that fine - tuning of tensor and isovector spin - orbit interactions could improve the description , as they affect both the spin - orbit splittings and collective shifts .",
    "work in this direction is in progress",
    ". a corresponding improvement of the skyrme parameterizations would be important not only for description of spin - flip m1 resonance ( which is a challenge itself ) but also for better treatment of the spin - orbit interaction in nuclei .",
