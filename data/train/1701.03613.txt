    "figure [ fig : schemedssc ] shows a simplified scheme of the connection . the led driver triggered by the cc sends one light pulse every bunch train , emulating the time structure of xfel.eu .    the led driver is composed of three stages : an lvds to ttl signal stage ( fin1002 ) and a ttl amplifier composed by multiple buffer ( ac541 ) and a fast mosfet ( fdg8850nz ) that can drive .",

    "we observe lower ( down to the baseline ) signals on the detector when the light pulse is not fully inside ( and eventually falls outside ) the detector integration window .",
    "the exact synchronization between the led and the detector has been determined by identifying the point in time when the intensity of the signal on the detector is maximal . by repeating this test , as expected , the light pulse is observed always in a single and fixed memory cell , and with a stable content .",

    "the first part corresponds to low collected charge and has a higher slope , corresponding to the higher gain needed to achieve single photon sensitivity also at very low photon energies . in the second part , the slope of the curve is lower , corresponding to lower gain at higher signals , needed to extend the dynamic range .    by systematically changing the light intensity",
