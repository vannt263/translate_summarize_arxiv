    "are usually associated with the first excited landau level , where the nature of the effective interaction is believed to facilitate the pairing between cfs.@xcite the paradigm of such paired states is the so - called `` pfaffian '' state introduced by moore and read,@xcite @xmath15 \\phi_{2}(\\ { z \\})$ ] , which explains the fqhe observed at @xmath16.@xcite in addition to the charge part @xmath17 , which fixes the filling factor , we have also a pairing in the _ neutral _ sector described by the object @xmath18@xcite in contrast to the laughlin and jain states with anyonic excitations satisfying abelian statistics , the moore - read state represents the simplest paired state of spin - polarized electrons which supports excitations with non - abelian statistics@xcite of interest in topologically protected quantum computation.@xcite    if the spin of the electrons is not necessarily frozen out by the magnetic field , the electrons could find it more favorable to reorganize themselves into one of the competing abelian phases called multicomponent halperin states.@xcite in these states the hall quantization is a result of internal degrees of freedom of the electrons ( provided by the spin or layer index ) . at half filling",

    "we restrict the discussion to the coulomb bilayer system , which is a generic two - component system where the `` spin '' @xmath28 denotes the two layers in which the electrons are localized .",
    "in such a system , it is commonly speculated that the antisymmetrization mechanism is provided by the tunneling term @xmath29 which combines the single - particle wave functions into symmetric ( even ) and antisymmetric ( odd ) superpositions , @xmath30 .",

    "recent experiments@xcite found even denominator fractions in wide quantum wells in the lll .",
    "the results obtained within the present bilayer model may be relevant also in the study of wide quantum wells insofar as the latter can , with moderate approximations , effectively be described by a bilayer hamiltonian , where the tunneling term mimics the effective confinement gap between the lowest and the first excited electronic sublevel.@xcite    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "remember that the associated bcs wave function in the even channel reads @xmath60 .",
    "one notices then that an increase of the chemical potential @xmath61 controlled by the large value of the tunneling parameter @xmath32 is equivalent to a reduction of the order parameter @xmath62",

    "we also use @xmath99 , the expectation value of the @xmath100 operator in the ground state , to monitor the two - component to one - component transition , whereas @xmath101 remains zero throughout , which is due to the weaker interlayer as compared to the intralayer interaction . starting from the long - range hamiltonian ( fig .",

    ", it is not surprising that the large - tunneling limit of the short - range hamiltonian is the compressible cfl : @xmath112 in this case reduces to the repulsive hard core @xmath113 pseudopotential which has a tendency to produce the jain cf state .",
    "this is also apparent in the fact that the ground states for large tunneling are obtained in the angular momentum sectors that agree with the predictions for the excitations of the cfl yielding overlap of @xmath114 with the excited cf sea ground state .",
    "therefore , the results for the short - range hamiltonian are suggestive that we may have a direct 331-cfl transition in the thermodynamic limit because the transition point seems to be shifting towards smaller tunnelings as we increase @xmath7 .",
    "notice , however , that in contrast to the incompressible 331 and pfaffian states , which occur at a shift @xmath115 , the cfl has a shift @xmath116 . on the sphere , the two incompressible states",

    "this problem is circumvented in ed on the torus presented hereafter in sec .",
    "[ sec_torus ] . in the coulomb case ,",
    "on the other hand , we observe a curious saturation of the ground state overlap with the pfaffian .",
    "we attribute this feature to the effect of the long range coulomb potential on a finite system .",
    "one notices that by adding an asymptotic tail to the  intra \" component of the short - range pseudopotentials @xmath117 ( @xmath118 nonzero for @xmath119 ) , one progressively increases the critical value of @xmath32 for the abrupt drop of the overlaps as @xmath120 ( pure coulomb ) .",

    "results for the coulomb interaction in the large @xmath32 limit ( fig . [ fig_sphere ] ) are similar to those obtained in ref . where single - layer zhang - das sarma interaction was used .",

    "the difference between the two interactions is obvious in the torus geometry ( sec.[sec_torus ] ) .",
    "the new result of the present paper is that we find the pfaffian signature even in the region without full polarization ( @xmath124 ) , as we elaborate in sec.[sec_discussion ] .",
    "another way to compactify an infinite plane is to impose periodic boundary conditions on a unit cell @xmath125.@xcite this also produces a finite set of @xmath126 single - particle states which are periodic functions under the transformation of coordinates @xmath127 ( we assume that there are no additional phases generated by such a transformation ) .",
    "because of the presence of magnetic field , the many - body hamiltonian reduces in the invariant subspace of the magnetic translation group@xcite and the eigenstates are labeled by the pseudomomentum @xmath128 , restricted to the brillouin zone @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the greatest common divisor of @xmath131 .",
    "contrary to the sphere , trial states on the torus are uniquely specified by their filling factor and thus we can directly address transitions between the 331 state , the pfaffian and the cfl .",
    "moreover , states in this geometry are distinguished by their ground - state degeneracy .",
    "if the filling factor is @xmath132 ( @xmath133 having no common divisor ) , there is a generic degeneracy of @xmath134 which comes from the center of mass motion@xcite having no physical importance , so we implicitly assume it in what follows .",
    "apart from this , there can be additional degeneracies occuring due to special point symmetry of the brillouin zone ( trivial ) or those that arise from the multicomponent@xcite or the non - abelian nature of the state.@xcite for the 331 state we expect a quadruplet of states ( up to the center of mass degeneracy ) one of which belongs to the @xmath135 sector of the hilbert space and the remaining three are located at the corners of the brillouin zone , @xmath136 .",
    "in contrast to the 331 state , the moore - read pfaffian has only a threefold degeneracy@xcite @xmath136 , whereas compressible states in general do not possess clearly defined degeneracies ( they may appear to have accidental degeneracies which are functions of the aspect ratio of the torus @xmath137 , particle number and any other parameter ) .",

    "previous results lend support to the scenario of an intermediate critical phase in a long - range coulomb system , which has a small gap ( fig .",
    "[ fig_criticalphase_torus ] ) but possesses large overlap with the moore - read pfaffian ( fig .",
    "[ fig_criticalphase_sphere ] ) .",
    "we would like to stress that all of our conclusions are based on the idealized bilayer hamiltonian ( [ main_hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "as such , it is not clear at present to what extent they apply to the experiments@xcite where the electron density - profile differs significantly from an ideal bilayer . with respect to theoretical studies ,",
    "stronger indication of topological degeneracy is likely to be found in a model that assumes non - zero thickness of each layer,@xcite but that would lead also to a substantial decrease of the gap.@xcite",
    "in sec . [ sec_numerics ] we found that in a system with a fixed number of particles and the tunneling commonly expressed as @xmath168 , there is only circumstantial evidence for the clear pfaffian phase in finite systems that can be studied by ed .",
    "this evidence appears most striking when coulomb overlaps in the spherical geometry are considered ( fig .",
    "[ fig_sphere ] ) .",
    "however , these overlaps must be interpreted with caution : on the sphere we can indeed only study the competition between pfaffian and an _ excited _ cfl state ( containing a quasiparticle ) because the ground - state candidates occur at different values for the shift @xmath94 as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec_sphere ] . as we have explained there , the latter state is indeed favored by short - range interactions",
    ". moreover , even when the ground state is described by the pfaffian state , the energy spectrum is not that of a typical incompressible state with a gap to all excitations . therefore , an explanation for the large coulomb overlap with the pfaffian may be the shift which artifically favors it over the cfl phase .",
    "this interpretation agrees with the results in the torus geometry , which treats both phases on the same footing and which suggests that the cfl is the likely outcome of tunneling on the 331 state .",
    "we can give two general arguments for this .",
    "first , strong tunneling has a tendency to polarize the spin in the @xmath106-direction , and one therefore crosses over to an effective one - component system that in the lll favors the formation of a compressible cfl phase .",
    "second , we have shown in the bcs approach for the charge - neutral sector ( sec .",
    "[ sec_tunneling ] ) that tunneling does not only lower the chemical potential @xmath169 in the odd channel but also _ increases _ that in the even channel , @xmath61 .",
    "we argued that this leads to the insufficiency of the bcs model description , which then describes a local maximum and the system crosses over to a cfl .",
    "it is clear that , in addition to tunneling , one also must find a way to prevent the effective even - channel chemical potential from becoming too large if the weakly - paired phase is to be established in the system . in this section",
    ", we propose a way to implement this requirement formally via generalized tunneling constraint . on the level of the bcs model used in sec . [ sec_tunneling ]",
    ", this constraint leads to a stable weak - pairing phase in the even channel . in the following subsection",
    "a we describe a formal implementation of the constraint in a system of bcs paired fermions .",
    "on the basis of this model , we propose , in subsection b a system in contact with a reservoir with which it can exchange particles so that , with the tunneling term included , a stable pfaffian phase can be reached .",
    "cauchy determinant pairing describes @xmath40-wave pairing of @xmath20 and @xmath21 particles , and in order to recover the spinless pfaffian pairing , we need to  identify \" @xmath20 with @xmath21 . within a functional formalism , that amounts to adding a term of the form    @xmath170\\ ] ]    to the langragian density via grassmannian lagrange multiplier @xmath171 .",
    "we will assume instead that we can alternatively express this via the constraint @xmath172[\\psi_{\\uparrow}({\\bf r } ) - \\psi_{\\downarrow}({\\bf r})],\\ ] ] in terms of the bosonic multiplier @xmath173 . by construction",
    "this constraint affects only the odd channel . within the mean - field approximation of a spatially constant multiplier @xmath174",
    ", one may identify @xmath175 , i.e. the effect of the multiplier is the same as the tunneling term in sec .",
    "[ sec_tunneling ] , except for an overall decrease of the chemical potential , @xmath176 , which eventually yields a @xmath177-independent chemical potential in the even channel , @xmath178 , as mentioned above .",
    "integration over the lagrange multiplier projects to @xmath179 , where @xmath180/\\sqrt{2}$ ] is again the odd spin superpostion written in terms of the fermion fields @xmath181 , i.e. it leaves us with no density in the odd channel .",
    "the bcs hamiltonian including the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) has the same form as ( [ ham ] ) except that now @xmath182 , as a consequence of the above - mentioned shift in the chemical potential .",
    "we can diagonalize it by a bogoliubov transformation , @xmath183 the equation @xmath184 = e \\alpha_{{{\\bf k}}}$ ] then defines the bogoliubov - de gennes equations and the hamiltonian is transformed into the canonical form @xmath185 where the eigenvalues @xmath186 and @xmath187 are given by @xmath188 respectively .",
    "the eigenvectors corresponding to @xmath189 and @xmath190 are , respectively , @xmath191 to find the stationary point for the action defined by the diagonalized bcs hamiltonian at zero temperature , it is useful to continue @xmath177 from the real axis to the complex plane @xmath192 ( see ref . for details ) .",
    "the part @xmath193 , through its dependence on @xmath177 ,    @xmath194    determines the stationary point : @xmath195 introducing the notation @xmath196 for the analytically continued chemical potential in the odd channel , we continue as @xmath197 which gives us the stationary point @xmath198 or , equivalently , @xmath199 and we have strong coupling in the odd channel . for our choice @xmath200 ,",
    "we thus obtain weak coupling in the even channel that has a pfaffian description@xcite in @xmath201 ( even ) variables [ see the expression for @xmath202 ( [ alphas ] ) ] . unlike the situation in sec . [ sec_tunneling ] , with the same assumption that @xmath203 does not renormalize strongly with tunneling",
    ", the chemical potential of the even channel stays the same and the even channel can thus be weakly paired .",
    "the previous discussion was on the simplified model of the 331 physics in terms of neutral fermions with an additional constraint that leads to the pfaffian , but seems artificial and hard to implement in an experimental setting .",
    "nevertheless it suggests a possible way to achieve the stable pfaffian phase . with respect to ordinary tunneling",
    "the generalized constraint can be modeled by strong tunneling and an additional term in the effective description , @xmath204 , where @xmath7 is the total number of particles and @xmath177 tunneling strength as before.@xcite the chemical potential ( of the whole system ) depends on the tunneling and changes as @xmath205 .",
    "then we have the following physical picture in mind : as we take @xmath206 this decrease of the chemical potential with tunneling will imply the decrease of the density of the system . on the other hand , from the solution of the bcs system with the generalized constraint , we see that the effective chemical potential of the even channel stays the same - equal to @xmath42 , eq .",
    "( [ eigenvalues ] ) .",
    "this means also that the number of particles in the even channel stays the same , so the effects of the tunneling and the additional term cancels , but the polarization @xmath55 increases with tunneling .",
    "thus we effectively maintain the same effective parameter @xmath42 with tunneling , its value will not increase , and we will be able to achieve the stable pfaffian phase . to be more specific and quantitative about the role of fluctuating density in achieving the pfaffian , we discuss in the remainder of this section the necessary dependence of density on tunneling .",
    "we will recover the demand for the decreasing density for the case of strong tunneling .",
    "our bcs hamiltonian , which is also the thermodynamic potential @xmath207 at zero temperature , is specific for the fact that the independent thermodynamic variable , along with volume and temperature , is the chemical potential @xmath208 , given by @xmath209 .",
    "therefore , as we change @xmath177 ( the parameter of the hamiltonian ) , we also induce a change in the chemical potential @xmath210 and this implies @xmath211 for the particular system .",
    "the effective chemical potential , on the other hand , is in this case @xmath212 as before , this relation shows how the chemical potential renormalizes as a parameter @xmath177 of the bcs hamiltonian is varied .",
    "we keep the volume constant and measure @xmath7 with @xmath213 in the usual ansatz : @xmath214 and eq .",
    "( [ condition_eq ] ) becomes @xmath215 differentiating and converting the sum in @xmath193 into an integral over @xmath216 , we obtain the partial differential equation , @xmath217 from which we can extract the limiting case @xmath218 when @xmath219 with the constant factor @xmath220 , i.e. for large tunneling we should decrease the density of the system to stay at small @xmath221 and to stabilize the pfaffian .",
    "we expect this limit to be pertinent to the experiments such as ref . where the compressible state starts to show signs of incompressibility upon density imbalance . enforcing the condition ( [ bla2 ] )",
    "is then expected to lead to strengthening of the paired pfaffian state , as summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig_diagram2 ] where the dashed line represents schematically a phase trajectory of the system that evolves under the generalized tunneling constraint ( in the large @xmath32 limit ) .",
    "( [ bla2 ] ) shows , in this case the density of the system needs to be decreased simultaneously with the increase of tunneling @xmath32 .",
    "this can be achieved conventionally via the application of a gate voltage to the evaporated top / bottom gates as e.g. in refs . or by growing _ in situ _ a @xmath222-gaas layer that can serve as a gate .",
    "@xcite    the main reason why we find it desirable to have an open system in the experiment is our inability to specify the parameters of the simplified , effective read - green model and pin - point the optimal density for which the pfaffian state would be strong . with a better knowledge of the microscopic details of the system , one may as well fix a particular density ( which we expect to be small ) for a given , not too large , tunneling strength where the pfaffian will be stable .",
    "however , an open system would allow a systematic study over a range of tunneling strengths in which the pfaffian would show a characteristic strengthening that would distinguish it from any other incompressible candidates .    .",
    "note that , as in fig .",
    "[ fig_diagram ] , @xmath42 denotes the effective chemical potential equal to the chemical potential of the even channel in the strong tunneling limit . ]",
    "therefore , in principle , by changing the density of the system we can achieve a stable pfaffian phase .",
    "we would like to compare the present discussion which is based on the simplified model of neutral fermions ( mean field in nature with the simplifying assumption @xmath223 i.e. independent of tunneling ) with exact diagonalization in the lll in the previous section .",
    "the arguments presented here call for an open system with adjustable density which demands also the adjustment of the magnetic field @xmath224 to achieve the stable pfaffian phase .",
    "although doing so will preserve the filling factor , in general changing the total density may enhance the role of ll mixing and thus invalidate the lll assumption in the exact diagonalizations .",
    "it will also lead to the renormalization of the parameters of the bcs effective model not taken into account in sec . [ sec_tunneling ] .",
    "indeed , when lowering the total chemical potential via the generalized constraint , the density is also decreased . on the other hand",
    "the ratio between interaction strength @xmath225 and cyclotron frequency @xmath226 is proportional to @xmath227 , from which we see that the lll projection is invalidated if the density is significantly reduced .",
    "therefore to reach and establish the pfaffian phase it is likely that ll mixing has to be taken into account .",
    "this has been discussed in the recent literature @xcite as a way to stabilize the pfaffian phase . here",
    "we seek the pfaffian in a two - component setting when a parameter of the system @xmath177 is varied , which makes the inclusion of higher lls harder .",
    "if we remain in the lll , changing of the density amounts to simple rescaling of spectra @xmath228 with @xmath229 ) , which can not induce any signficant effect such as the change in the nature of ( quasi)degeneracy of ground states on the torus . even if the evidence for a pfaffian phase is rather weak for the system sizes studied here , one may hope that the increase of these sizes will improve the case for such a state in the lll as the odd channel may assume the role of the first excited landau level before a complete polarization .",
    "we investigated the possibility of creating the moore - read pfaffian out of the paired two - component 331 state via tunneling .",
    "exact diagonalization , performed under the constraint of lll projection and fixed total number of particles , could not detect a stable pfaffian phase , but a critical one between 331 and cfl phases . while the short - range interaction is likely to favor a direct transition from the 331 to the cfl phase",
    ", long - range coulomb interactions leave the possibility for a pfaffian - like phase if the parameters of the system are tuned in a special way .",
    "based on the connection between our numerical results and the effective bcs hamiltonian theory of paired states , we argue that one way to stabilize the pfaffian state is to change the density ( number of particles ) of the system while increasing the tunneling .",
    "our analysis was restricted to the coulomb bilayer system and the tunneling term of the form @xmath168 , which is small in magnitude and generally difficult to control .",
    "similar considerations apply to the quantum well systems@xcite where @xmath230 stand for the two lowest electronic subbands and @xmath32 acts like a zeeman energy . in these systems ,",
    "the analogue of the tunneling term used in our paper can be deployed to create asymmetric charge distribution in the wide quantum well.@xcite the interplay of these two kinds of terms , tunneling and zeeman , will be addressed in future work .",
