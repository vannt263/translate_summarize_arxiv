    "a common approach to gain some understanding of the vacuum structure of yang - mills theory and qcd is to consider effective theories restricting the path integral to a small subset of gauge field configurations , which are supposed to be of physical importance .",
    "well known examples are ensembles of singular gauge instantons ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , which are able to explain many phenomena on a qualitative level , in particular chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "confinement , however , is absent in these ensembles , although there has been some speculation that very large instantons have the ability to cure this problem ( @xcite quoted in @xcite ) .",
    "more recently related models for yang - mills theory have been proposed , which exhibit clear signs of confinement .",
    "there are ensembles of regular gauge instantons and merons @xcite , there is the pseudoparticle approach @xcite , there are models of calorons with non - trivial holonomy @xcite and there is an ensemble of dyons @xcite .",
    "the successes of these models regarding confinement have either been attributed to the long range nature of their building blocks or to maximally non - trivial holonomy",
    ".    however , a satisfactory model for yang - mills theory should not only exhibit a linearly rising fundamental potential , but also also casimir scaling for higher representations as well as @xmath0-ality dependence . in particular the adjoint potential should exhibit string breaking , when the corresponding charges are separated beyond a certain distance . for a review regarding the confinement problem in yang - mills theory",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to demonstrate that the pseudoparticle approach applied to su(2 ) yang - mills theory correctly reproduces the potential between two static charges for various representations .",
    "particular emphasis is put on string breaking in the adjoint representation .",
    "when computing the fundamental representation potential , wilson loops are appropriate observables . in agreement with common expectation",
    "the resulting potential is linearly rising both in lattice calculations ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) and in the pseudoparticle approach ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to that , the adjoint potential is expected to saturate at large separations , due to screening by gluons . however , various lattice studies @xcite have shown that the computation of this potential fails , when using wilson loops only .",
    "one also obtains a linearly rising potential , because of the poor overlap between `` string trial states '' forming the wilson loops and the ground state , which is essentially a `` two gluelump state '' for large separations ( an exception to that is a rather recent study considering 3d yang - mills theory , where wilson loops of extremely large temporal separation have been computed @xcite ) . a possible way to overcome this problem is to consider whole sets of trial states including both string states ( large ground state overlap for small separations ) and two gluelump states ( large ground state overlap for large separations ) .",
    "the adjoint potential can then be computed from the corresponding correlation matrices via standard variational techniques .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_001 ] , we briefly summarize the basic principle of the pseudoparticle approach , which is discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "then we compute `` pure wilson loop static potentials '' for charges in various representations ( section  [ sec_002 ] ) .",
    "we determine the fundamental string tension to set the scale , and we demonstrate casimir scaling for higher representations . in section  [ sec_003 ]",
    "we discuss gluelump creation operators and their quantum numbers .",
    "we also present numerical results for a couple of gluelump masses and give estimates regarding the string breaking distance . in section  [ sec_004 ]",
    "we compute the adjoint potential using both string - like and two - gluelump - like trial states .",
    "as expected , it is linearly rising at intermediate separations , but saturates at large separations .",
    "moreover , we perform a mixing analysis showing clear evidence for string breaking . both the string breaking distance and the shape of the potential and its first two excitations are in qualitative agreement with lattice results .",
    "finally we give a summary and a brief outlook ( section  [ sec_005 ] ) .",
    "in the following we briefly review the pseudoparticle approach and its application to su(2 ) yang - mills theory . for a more detailed presentation",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the pseudoparticle approach is to restrict the yang - mills path integral to those gauge field configurations , which can be obtained by a linear superposition of a small number of localized building blocks ( pseudoparticles ) . a suitable choice , which is able to reproduce many essential features of su(2 ) yang - mills theory , particularly a linearly rising fundamental potential , is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the pseudoparticle size , + @xmath3 and + @xmath4 .",
    "the gauge field configurations entering the path integral are of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the randomly chosen , but fixed position of the @xmath7-th pseudoparticle , @xmath8 its amplitude and @xmath9 its color orientation .",
    "ensemble averages of observables @xmath10 are defined by an integration over pseudoparticle degrees of freedom namely amplitudes and color orientations : @xmath11 e^{-s[a ] } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] each gauge field configuration is weighted by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the standard yang - mills action @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the coupling constant .",
    "such finite dimensional integrals can be computed by applying standard monte carlo techniques .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that around @xmath16 pseudoparticles ( [ eqn_001 ] ) to ( [ eqn_003 ] ) are sufficient to reproduce many essential features of su(2 ) yang - mills theory .",
    "in particular the potential between static charges in the fundamental representation is linear for large separations .",
    "moreover , like in lattice gauge theory the scale can be set by choosing the coupling constant appropriately .",
    "although the spacetime volume has been varied by a factor of @xmath17 with the total number of pseudoparticles kept constant , the dimensionless ratios @xmath18 and @xmath19 are essentially independent of the coupling constant and their numerical values are in qualitative agreement with lattice results ( @xmath20 : string tension ; @xmath21 : topological susceptibility ; @xmath22 : deconfinement temperature ) .",
    "although we use instanton - like building blocks ( [ eqn_001 ] ) and ( [ eqn_002 ] ) , we would like to stress that the pseudoparticle approach is not a semiclassical model .",
    "the intention is rather to approximate physically relevant gauge field configurations with a small number of degrees of freedom . in general",
    "these configurations are not close to solutions of the classical yang - mills equations of motion .",
    "as has been discussed extensively in @xcite , the successful qualitative modeling of yang - mills physics seems mainly be related to the long range nature of the building blocks ( [ eqn_001 ] ) to ( [ eqn_003 ] ) and to the transversality of ( [ eqn_001 ] ) and ( [ eqn_002 ] ) .      unlike in previous applications of the pseudoparticle approach @xcite",
    "we consider a 4d hypercubic spacetime region ( volume : @xmath23 ) with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this allows to fully exploit translational invariance and to adopt certain smearing techniques from lattice gauge theory ( cf .",
    "appendix  [ sec_007 ] and [ sec_008 ] ) .",
    "periodic versions of the pseudoparticles ( [ eqn_001 ] ) to ( [ eqn_003 ] ) are obtained by applying a blending technique introduced in @xcite applied to all four spacetime directions ( width of the blending region : @xmath24 ) .",
    "we use @xmath25 pseudoparticles ( [ eqn_001 ] ) to ( [ eqn_003 ] ) with @xmath26 .",
    "this amounts to a pseudoparticle size , which is of the same order of magnitude as their average nearest neighbor distance .",
