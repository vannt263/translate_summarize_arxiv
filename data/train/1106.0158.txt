    "accumulation of impurities in the core of fusion devices would have detrimental effect on fusion reactivity due to increased radiation losses and plasma dilution .",
    "significant effort has therefore been spent during recent years to identify plasma conditions in which accumulation can be avoided .",
    "one of the most promising methods for obtaining flat or hollow impurity density profiles is to use radio frequency heating .",
    "this has been shown to work well in various experiments @xcite but the physical mechanism by which the change of the direction of the impurity convective velocity occurs has not yet been clearly identified in spite of the various efforts that have been made @xcite . in particular",
    "the reason for the flat impurity density profiles in ion cyclotron resonance heated ( icrh ) discharges in jet has been debated for many years @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite it was shown that a poloidal asymmetry could lead to a significant reduction of the impurity zero - flux density gradient ( also called the peaking factor ) , and even a sign change in the impurity flux , if the asymmetry is sufficiently large .",
    "this suggests a possible explanation for the avoidance of accumulation of high-@xmath0 impurities with icrh .    in this paper a numerical investigation of the effect of poloidal asymmetry on impurity transport is presented . in particular ,",
    "the dependence of the impurity density peaking factor on charge number , inverse ion- and electron temperature scale lengths and inverse electron density scale length is analyzed .",
    "also , the role of parallel ion compressibility is studied .",
    "the results are benchmarked to gyro @xcite in the poloidally symmetric case .",
    "it is found that inboard accumulation gives rise to negative peaking factors ( outward impurity convection and hollow impurity profile ) , both in ion temperature gradient ( itg ) and trapped electron ( te ) mode driven turbulence .",
    "the sign and magnitude of the peaking factor will be shown to be sensitive not only to the asymmetry strength but also to the temperature gradient , and it is more pronounced in the low temperature gradient region characteristic for the plasma core .",
    "the peaking factor is expected to be negative for moderate to high impurity charge numbers ( above @xmath1 ) for jet - like experimental parameters @xcite . in te mode",
    "dominated cases up - down asymmetry can also give rise to negative peaking factors if the electron temperature gradient is sufficiently large .",
    "as noted in previous work @xcite , in the poloidally symmetric case , that parallel compressibility has a significant effect on the peaking factor . as we will see in this paper this effect is even more pronounced for asymmetric impurity densities , and will lead to negative peaking factors for lower asymmetry strengths than without taking into account parallel compressibility .",

    "poloidal impurity asymmetries in tokamaks can arise due to various reasons : e.g. difference in impurity source location , toroidal rotation or neoclassical effects .",
    "there is a wealth of experimental evidence for poloidal asymmetries @xcite . in the plasma core in - out",
    "asymmetries can arise due to the presence of radio frequency ( rf ) heating ( henceforth `` in - out '' and `` out - in '' asymmetries will refer to the situations when the maximum of the poloidally varying impurity density is at the inboard and outboard sides of the plasma , respectively ) . a detailed physical explanation of why icrh favors inboard accumulation , together with the description of the experimental results , is given in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the underlying principle is that the asymmetry is a result of the increase of the hydrogen - minority density on the outboard side .",
    "these particles tend to be trapped on the outside of the torus and the turning points of their orbits drift towards the resonance layer due to the heating .",
    "the poloidal asymmetry in the hydrogen - minority density gives rise to an electric field that pushes the other ion species to the inboard side . in the case of highly - charged impurities ,",
    "this effect is amplified by their higher charge @xmath0 .",
    "the rf - induced accumulation of minority ions on the outboard side leads to a corresponding impurity accumulation on the inboard side by the following mechanism .",
    "if the plasma consists of electrons , bulk ions , impurity ions and rf - heated minority ions then it can be expected that all species except the minority ions are boltzmann distributed ( the dynamics of the minority ions is strongly affected by the heating ) .",
    "if a particle species @xmath2 is boltzmann distributed , the poloidal variation of the density is @xmath3 , where the tilde denotes the variation on the flux surface , @xmath4 is the charge and @xmath5 is the temperature of the species .",
    "quasineutrality requires that @xmath6 where the subscript zero indicates the density where the potential @xmath7 vanishes .",
    "if @xmath7 is normalized so that @xmath8 , the poloidal variation of the impurity density becomes @xmath9 since the poloidal variation in the impurity density has the opposite sign to that of the minority ions , the accumulation of the latter on the outboard side gives rise to an electric field that pushes the other ion species to the inboard side .",
    "simulations of the hydrogen ion distribution function in the presence of rf heating with the monte carlo code fido @xcite show that a considerable out - in asymmetry in the hydrogen ion density can be expected , which is sufficient to account for the observed in - out asymmetry in the impurity density .    in the tokamak edge , where the plasma is sufficiently collisional , also steep radial pressure or temperature gradients",
    "can give rise to an in - out asymmetry .",
    "these effects have been observed in e.g. alcator c - mod @xcite , and it has been shown that the observations are in qualitative agreement with neoclassical theory @xcite .",
    "the sign and magnitude of these asymmetries depend sensitively and nonlinearly on magnetic geometry , fraction of impurities in the plasma and rotation .",
    "neoclassical theory also predicts an up - down asymmetry , which is caused by the ion - impurity friction .",
    "since impurity transport is usually dominated by drift - wave turbulence , in this work we focus on the effect of the impurity poloidal asymmetry on impurity transport driven by microinstabilities .",
    "we assume that the processes that cause the asymmetry are not affected significantly by the fact that the cross - field transport is dominated by fluctuations . for simplicity",

    "conditions in which the convective impurity flux is directed outward are particularly interesting . in order to find such conditions many experiments",

    "one way to expel the impurities from the plasma core is to maintain sawtooth crashes in a controlled way by applying central icrh  @xcite .",
    "it is observed that this method will indeed remove the impurities from the plasma core .",
    "however , it was shown that even though sawtooth crashes hamper the accumulation of the impurities their contribution is less relevant compared to the effect of the icrh itself  @xcite .",
    "another technique which has been successful in removing the impurities from the plasma core and is routinely used in tokamak experiments such as in the asdex - u tokamak is the application of a very localized central ecrh  @xcite .",
    "simulations with both linear and non - linear gyrokinetic models have shown that under these conditions the electron temperature gradient is strongly peaked and therefore , modes propagating in the electron diamagnetic drift direction are the dominant instability responsible for the turbulence driven transport @xcite .",
    "the interaction between the related electrostatic potential fluctuations and the parallel dynamics of the impurities leads to an outward convection of impurities .",
    "these results are in agreement with experimental observation in asdex - u for the very central region ( @xmath113 )  @xcite . in other tokamak experiments for example at jet the application of the central rf heating has also been explored with success . in these experiments",
    "it has been observed that the dominant instabilities are not te - modes but rather modes directed in the ion diamagnetic drift direction , itg - modes , which theoretically should result in an inward impurity flux .",
    "it has been debated that in the very central region of plasmas at jet the transport is mostly driven by neoclassical effects and by applying a strong central heating as the temperature gradient peaks the neoclassical temperature screening effects become dominant and result in an outward directed impurity flux . under some plasma conditions these effects may be the reason for the observed behavior @xcite however , usually the observed transport is an order of magnitude larger than the neoclassical predictions implying that the impurity transport is turbulence driven @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we assume that the impurity density is in the form of @xmath114 where the poloidal dependence is represented by @xmath42^n$ ] , and discuss the impact of such a dependence on the impurity peaking factor in the core of tokamak plasmas .",
    "various mechanisms may give rise to a poloidal asymmetry of impurity density : difference in impurity source location , toroidal rotation or neoclassical effects . among these",
    "is an in - out poloidal asymmetry observed in plasmas where rf heating is applied .",
    "the mechanism responsible for this behavior was explained through rf - induced accumulation of minority ions on the outboard side of the torus giving rise to a corresponding impurity accumulation on the inboard side as was discussed in sec .  2 .",
    "the strength of the impurity accumulation depends on the impurity charge ( higher for heavier impurities ) and the plasma parameters such as temperature gradient",
    ". however , the exact form of these dependences is not yet known and further analysis is needed in this area .    we have found that an in - out poloidal asymmetry of the impurity density ( @xmath115 ) can lead to an outward impurity flux ( negative peaking factor ) in both itg and te mode dominated cases , and this effect becomes stronger as the asymmetry strength ( @xmath80 ) increases . in this case",
    "the peaking factor is strongly charge dependent and it becomes more negative for heavier impurities . in te mode dominated case",
    "an up - down asymmetry can also generate a negative peaking factor .",
    "this can be a contributing reason for the observed flat impurity density profiles in plasmas with ecrh , and up - down asymmetries have indeed been observed in ec heated plasmas @xcite , although the physical mechanism for these asymmetries is not entirely understood .",
    "the reason for the sign change of the impurity peaking factor in the presence of a poloidal asymmetry is attributed to the interaction between the poloidal variation of the related electrostatic potential and the poloidal dependence of the impurity density . if parallel compressibility effects are taken into account the imaginary part of the electrostatic potential is the determining factor in the sign change of the impurity peaking factor . in summary",
    ", our results suggest that poloidal asymmetries can significantly alter the turbulence driven impurity transport and therefore , have to be taken into account .",
    "these asymmetries may have a significant role in determining the impurity accumulation properties in plasmas with radio frequency heating .",
    "therefore , there is a strong need for development of new tools in order to detect poloidal asymmetries and determine the effect of rf heating in their generation and the dependence of the asymmetry function to various plasma parameters .",
