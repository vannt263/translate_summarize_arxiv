    "<S> it s instructive to compare the lpm effect in oriented crystal for radiation and pair creation processes . </S>",
    "<S> the manifestation of the lpm effect is essentially different because of existence of threshold in pair creation process . </S>",

    "<S> below @xmath143 influence of field of axis is weak and the relative contribution of the lpm effect attains 5.5 % for t=100 k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is no threshold in radiation process and @xmath146 becomes larger than @xmath147 at much lower energy @xmath20 and starting from this energy the influence of field of axis suppresses strongly the lpm effect . </S>",
    "<S> so the energy interval in which the lpm effect could appear is much narrower than for pair creation and its relative contribution is less than 1 % in w , axis @xmath56 . since value of @xmath20 depends weakly on @xmath148 ( eq.([10 ] ) ) , @xmath149 ( eqs.([5 ] ) , ( [ 6 ] ) ) and @xmath150 ( eq.([9 ] ) ) the relative contribution of the lpm effect @xmath142 for light elements significantly smaller . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the above analysis shows that influence of multiple scattering on basic electromagnetic processes in oriented crystal ( radiation and pair creation ) is very limited especially for radiation process .    * </S>",
