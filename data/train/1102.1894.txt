    "recent systematic x - ray studies of agn ( active galactic nuclei ) with _ asca _ , _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ have established that at least half of all active galaxies host photo - ionised `` warm '' absorbers ( e.g. reynolds & fabian 1995 ; blustin et al . 2005 ) and that they may in fact be ubiquitous in agn , becoming observable only in certain lines of sight ( krongold et al .",
    "2008 ; although one other interpretation is that @xmath150 per cent of agn do not have warm absorbers ) .",
    "when observed at high spectral resolution ( such as with the transmission gratings on - board _ chandra _ ) , these absorbers are known to produce numerous narrow absorption features ranging from various elements such as oxygen , silicon , neon , carbon , nitrogen , sulphur , magnesium and iron ( e.g. kaspi et al .",
    "2002 ; crenshaw , kraemer & george 2003 ; mckernan , yaqoob & reynolds 2007 ) .",
    "the associated lines are often blueshifted , thus implying outflowing winds ( ranging in velocity from several hundred to several thousand kms@xmath0 ; blustin et al .",
    "2005 ) and arise from a wide range of column densities and levels of ionisation . through the study of blueshifted absorption lines of k - shell fe , recent observations of higher luminosity agn have also suggested the presence of highly ionised ( `` hot '' ) absorbers originating in high - velocity disc winds ( @xmath5 ) with around a dozen cases to date ( e.g. pg 1211 + 143 , pounds et al . 2003 ; pds 456 , reeves , obrien & ward 2003 ) although there are a set of lower luminosity sources that still exhibit deep absorption lines at fek but require high column densities and have outflow velocities on the order of a few thousand kms@xmath0 ( e.g. mrk 776 , miller et al . 2007 ;",
    "ngc 3516 , turner et al . 2005",
    "; ngc 1365 , risaliti et al . 2005 ; ngc 3783 , reeves et al .",
    "recently , tombesi et al . (",
    "2010 ) found evidence for blueshifted features in 17 objects within their sample of 42 radio - quiet agn observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _ , detecting 22 absorption lines at rest - frame energies > 7.1kev .",
    "this implies that high velocity outflows may be a common feature in radio - quiet agn .",
    "such ultra - fast outflows indicate that the gas must be located very close to the nucleus of the agn and so deep studies of these objects are vital to establish a greater understanding of the outflow kinematics and locations relative to the central continuum source which in turn can help to ultimately unravel the inner structure of agn .",
    "+ one possible interpretation regarding accretion disc outflows is that they are perhaps produced as a result of radiation pressure a few @xmath6 from the event horizon ( proga , stone & kallman 2000 ) .",
    "the high luminosities of these systems are the result of radiatively efficient accretion onto a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) and such outflows could be a consequence of near - eddington accretion ( king & pounds 2003 ) .",
    "an alternative interpretation of many outflows is that they could be magnetohydrodynamically ( mhd ) driven as has been suggested for such objects as gro j1655 - 40 ( miller et al .",
    "2008 ) and ngc 4151 ( kraemer et al . 2005 ; crenshaw & kraemer 2007 ) .",
    "the derived outflow rates can in some cases be comparable to the mass accretion rate ( several solar masses per year ) of the agn and so in terms of kinetic power , the outflow can be responsible for a significant proportion of the bolometric luminosity . as a result",
    ", outflows are considered to be an important phenomenon in agn and are believed to play a key role in feedback processes between the black hole and the host galaxy ( king 2003 , 2010 ) , ultimately leading to the observed @xmath7@xmath8 relation for galaxies ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) . + ngc 4051 is a nearby ( @xmath9 ; verheijen & sancisi 2001 ) narrow - line type 1 seyfert galaxy at a distance of 15.2mpc ( russel 2004 ) obtained from the tully - fisher relation for nearby galaxies ( tully & fisher 1977 ) .",
    "it has a black hole mass of @xmath10m@xmath11 determined via optical reverberation mapping ( denney et al .",
    "2009 ) and is well known for its extreme x - ray variability both on short and long time - scales with the x - ray spectrum hardening as the source flux becomes lower ( lamer et al .",
    "2003 ) , as seen in many other type 1 seyfert galaxies ( e.g. ngc 5506 , lamer , uttley & mchardy 2000 ; mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , vaughan & edelson 2001 ) .",
    "+ the warm absorber in ngc 4051 was studied by collinge et al .",
    "( 2001 ) with a simultaneous _ chandra _ hetg ( high energy transmission grating ) and _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) imaging spectrograph observation where they discovered two separate x - ray absorption systems corresponding to outflow velocities of @xmath12 and @xmath13kms@xmath0 .",
    "nine separate absorption systems were detected in the hst uv spectrum with one of the zones possibly corresponding to the lower velocity zone detected in the x - ray band .",
    "a further rgs ( reflection grating spectrometer ) observation with _ xmm - newton _ was analysed by ogle et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who claimed the presence of a relativistically broadened oviii ly@xmath14 emission line ( ew @xmath15ev ) at @xmath1655ev and suggested that this emission along with its associated radiative recombination continuum ( rrc ) could be responsible for the weak soft excess . however , they found no evidence of the high velocity outflow detected by collinge et al .",
    "the rgs data from 2001 and 2002 were also analysed by pounds et al .",
    "( 2004a ) and nucita et al .",
    "they note that the 2002 observation caught the source during an extended period of low flux ( @xmath16erg@xmath17s@xmath0 ) .",
    "pounds et al .",
    "( 2004a ) concluded that the hard x - ray spectral shape observed during this period of low flux was due to an increase in opacity of a substantial column of gas in the line - of - sight causing the spectrum to become dominated by a quasi - constant cold reflection component .",
    "+ a more recent study by krongold et al .",
    "( 2007 ) showed the presence of two distinct ionisation components for the absorber through a 100ks _ xmm - newton _ exposure . by measuring the electron densities through the absorber variability , they inferred that the absorbing components must be compact with the high and low ionisation zones existing at distances of 0.51l - d ( light - days ) and < 3.5l - d from the central engine respectively , well within the dusty torus and strongly suggestive of an accretion disc origin for the warm absorber wind .",
    "they calculated that the implied mass outflow rate of the warm absorber wind corresponds to approximately 25 per cent of the mass accretion rate of the source .",
    "they also detected several narrow emission lines in the rgs spectrum from cvi , nvi , ovii , oviii , neix and fexvii . +",
    "a further study of the warm absorber was also undertaken by steenbrugge et al .",
    "( 2009 ) through high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy using the _ chandra _ letg ( low energy transmission grating ) .",
    "they discovered that this object contains an outflowing wind consisting of four separate absorbing components ranging in ionisation parameter , log@xmath18 , from 0.07 to 3.19 .",
    "they found that the absorbing zone with log@xmath19 requires a high outflow velocity of @xmath20kms@xmath0 and from a study of the variability of the warm absorber , they inferred that three of the four absorbing zones appear to be located in the range of 0.021pc from the black hole .",
    "+ ngc 4051 was observed in 2005 with _",
    "suzaku _ when it was found to have fallen into an extended period of historically low flux ( terashima et al .",
    "a strong excess of emission was seen at energies > 10kev suggesting that the primary power - law continuum had largely disappeared and that the bulk of the observed emission was reflection - dominated ( e.g. guainazzi et al .",
    "1998 ; pounds et al .",
    "however , terashima et al . (",
    "2009 ) were able to describe the data using a partial covering model whereby the reflection - dominated emission and the intrinsic power - law emission are independently absorbed by gas covering some significant fraction of @xmath21sr .",
    "in this scenario , changes in the covering fraction of the partially - covered power - law component can account for the changes in the spectral shape at low energies whereas changes in the normalisation of the power - law component overlaid on a nearly constant hard component can account for the variability at energies > 3.5kev .",
    "this interpretation of the long - term spectral variability being caused by the primary x - ray continuum disappearing from view leaving behind a constant , hard , reflection - dominated component was supported by the results of miller et al .",
    "( 2010 ) through principal components analysis ( pca ) of the 2005 and 2008 _ suzaku _ data .",
    "miller et al . ( 2010 ) also suggested that the low - flux states are caused by variable partial covering obscuring the central engine which also explains the constancy of the narrow fek@xmath14 emission line flux .",
    "+ finally , the presence of an additional absorption feature at @xmath17.1kev was reported by pounds et al .",
    "( 2004a ) indicating that a highly ionised , high velocity outflow could be apparent in this source .",
    "further observations with _",
    "suzaku _ and _ xmm - newton _ have confirmed the presence of this feature along with an additional absorption line at @xmath16.8kev ( terashima et al .",
    "2009 ; pounds & vaughan 2010 , submitted ) .",
    "if the two absorption lines are associated with k - shell transitions from fexxv and fexxvi then their blueshift would imply that the material is outflowing with a velocity of @xmath22 .",
    "+ here we report on a @xmath1300ks _ chandra _ hetg ( high energy transmission grating ) observation of ngc 4051 where we aim to study the soft x - ray warm absorber in detail ( sections 4 and 5 ) .",
    "we also report on a contemporaneous 350ks _ suzaku _ observation where we study the fek band including the blueshifted fek absorption lines as the signature of the highest ionisation component of the outflowing wind .",
    "we then proceed to analyse the entire broad - band _ suzaku _ spectrum from 0.550.0kev .",
    "finally , with a combined analysis of the 2005 archival _ suzaku _ data ( exposure time @xmath1 120ks ) when the source was found to be in an extended period of low flux , we also aim to study the origin of the long - term x - ray variability of this agn ( section 6 ) .",
    "ngc 4051 was observed with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory ( weisskopf et al . 2000 ) on twelve different occasions dating from 2008 nov 6 to 2008 nov 30 with a total exposure time of @xmath1300ks .",
    "a log of the separate observations and their corresponding exposures is shown in table 1 .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "observations were performed with the high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ; markert et al .",
    "1994 ; canizares et al . 2005 ) in the focal plane of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; garmire et al . 2003 ) which consists of two separate gratings : the medium energy grating ( meg ; 0.48.0kev ) and the high energy grating ( heg ; 0.710.0kev ) .",
    "hetg data were reduced using version 4.1 of both the chandra interactive analysis of observations software package ( ciao ; fruscione et al .",
    "2006 ) and corresponding calibration database ( caldb ) .",
    "first order meg and heg spectra were extracted for the source and background for each individual observation .",
    "spectral redistribution matrix ( rmf ) files were created using the mkgrmf script for each first order grating arm ( -1 and + 1 ) for the meg and heg .",
    "telescope effective area files were also created using the fullgarf script incorporating the ciao tool mkgarf .",
    "events files were extracted from the negative and positive first order grating arms of the meg and heg allowing light curves and spectra to be extracted .",
    "the first order spectra were then combined for each individual exposure using combined response files ( with appropriate weighting ) for the meg and heg .",
    "the background was not subtracted however as it has a negligible effect in the energy ranges of interest here .",
    "the total count rates in the first - order energy spectra ( 0.510.0kev ) are @xmath23 and @xmath24cts@xmath0 for the meg and heg respectively ( or @xmath25 and @xmath26cts@xmath0 for the respective 0.55.0 and 1.08.0kev energy bands for the meg and heg which we adopt here ) .",
    "these count rates correspond to fluxes of @xmath27 and @xmath28erg@xmath17s@xmath0 ( see table 2 ) and luminosities of @xmath29 and @xmath30ergs@xmath0 for the respective 0.55.0 and 1.08.0kev energy bands for the meg and heg .",

    "the three front - illuminated xis chips ( xis 0,2,3 ; hereafter xis  fi ) were used in the spectral analysis of the 2005 data due to their greater sensitivity at fek . however , as the use of xis 2 was discontinued after a charge leak was discovered in 2006 , the spectral analysis from the 2008 data refers only to xis 0 and 3 .",
