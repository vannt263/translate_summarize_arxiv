    "the dynamic behavior of fluids in the bulk is characterized by transport properties such as the diffusion coefficient . in simple liquids",
    "they are governed by the molecular interactions which can be effectively treated as pair potentials .",
    "in complex fluids , such as water , the dynamics of the systems is governed by network - forming interactions .",
    "the potentials involved are in general highly anisotropic and the transport properties tend to exhibit unusual behaviors .    under confinement",
    "even normal liquids have an unusual behavior , very different from the physical properties observed in bulk .",

    "bulk water is anomalous in many of its characteristics .",
    "the maximum in water s density is a well - known anomaly but there are many others .",
    "the self - diffusion coefficient at fixed temperature for a normal liquid decreases under compression , while in liquid water it increases with the increase of pressure . in bulk water",
    "this is due to the hydrogen bonds that are created and destroyed making particles to move from one neighbor to another neighbor .",
    "notwithstanding its molecular simplicity water is quite hard to be modeled .",
    "the reason behind this difficulty is the presence of the hydrogen bonds , a non symmetric charge distribution and polarizability of the molecule that are density and temperature dependents .",
    "consequently , there are more than twenty - five ( bulk ) water models for computational simulation  empirical potentials  in which each of them give a different dipole moment , dielectric and self - diffusion constants , average configurational energy , density maximum , and expansion coefficient .",
    "more specifically , the maximum of density is found experimentally to be at @xmath1 @xmath2c ( for pressure @xmath3 atm ) while such models give values ranging from -45 @xmath2c ( spc model ) up to 25 @xmath2c ( pol5/tz model ) .",
    "the tip5p water model was built to match the 4 @xmath2c experimental result , but it fails in many other aspects.@xcite despite these limitations , these models have been used to understand the transport properties and phase transitions of confined water  @xcite .",
    "the results give a qualitative comparison with experiments without providing a complete understanding of the origin of the anomalies.@xcite the majority of the molecular water models are conceived focusing on accurately describe the hydrogen bonds and charge distributions since many of the water uncommon properties are believed to come from its highly directional interactions .",
    "examples are solvation and properties which depend on polarization .",
    "on the other hand , the literature have many examples in which systems with absence of anisotropic interactions still may present some of the water features  @xcite .",
    "some of its anomalous behavior may come from purely volumetric effects , which particularly is our focus in this work .    for confined systems , where water molecules interact in nanoscale distances",
    ", first principles simulations would be the appropriated tool for numerical comparison with experimental data .",
    "this procedure , however , has limitations . even for confined water systems , in which the sizes involved are much smaller than that ones found in bulk cases , thousands of atoms are necessary for attacking typical problems along with millions of simulation steps .",
    "in this sense , turns out that in the majority of cases _ ab initio _ techniques become impracticable for dealing with such computational demanding systems .    given the limitations of the full water models and the computational costs of the _ ab initio _",
    "simulations , classical effective empirical potentials became the simplest framework to understand the physics behind the anomalies of bulk water . from the desire of constructing a simple two - body potential capable of describing the anomalous behavior of bulk water , a number of models",
    "have been developed  @xcite . despite their simplicity",
    ", such models had successfully reproduced the thermodynamic , dynamic , and structural anomalous behavior present in bulk liquid water .",
    "they also predict the existence of a second critical point hypothesized by poole and collaborators  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that some of the unusual properties observed in water can be quite universal and possibly present in other systems .    in the case of confined water",
    "a number of attempts have been made to understand its thermodynamic and dynamic properties . for the confinement media ,",
    "nanotubes have been widely used for mimicking water confined into live organisms and as building blocks for technological applications , as desalination of water  @xcite .",
    "also , nanotubes can be used for drug delivery since they resemble biological ion channels  @xcite .",
    "in addition , confinement in nanopores and nanotubes have been used also to avoid spontaneous water crystallization below the melting point in an attempt to observe its hypothetical second critical point  @xcite .",
    "simulations employing some of the discussed molecular models for water , namely spc / e , tip4p - ew and st2 , confined in nanoscale channels exhibit two complementary effects : the melting temperature of the fluid at the center of the channel decreases and water crystallizes at the channel surface  @xcite .",
    "in addition to these thermodynamic properties , the mobility properties of confined water also exhibit an unusual behavior .",
    "experiments show an enhancement of the mobility orders of magnitude higher than what is predicted by the flow theories  @xcite .",
    "simulations  @xcite show an increase in the enhancement rate below a certain threshold radius .",
    "similarly the self - diffusion coefficient , @xmath4 , obtained through molecular dynamic simulations for atomistic models , below a certain radius increases with with decreasing radius  @xcite .    besides the thermodynamic and dynamic unusual properties of confined water",
    ", the structure also presents an interesting behavior .",
    "the water structure inside larger nanotubes exhibits a layered structure , while in narrow nanotubes a single file is observed .",
    "the layered water molecules can be found in a spiral - like chain ,  @xcite in a hexagonal structure for ( 6,6 ) carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) ,  @xcite a octagonal water - shell structure for a ( 9,9 ) cnt or a octagonal water - shell structure with a central water chain for a ( 10,10 ) cnt ,  @xcite and others different structures  @xcite .",
    "the presence of layering effects is also controversial .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations results by wang _",

    "@xcite do not show any obvious ordered water structure for ( 9,9 ) or ( 10,10 ) cnts , unlike the works of koles _ et al _  @xcite .",
    "this difference in findings can be caused by the influence of the water model used and corresponding lennard - jones parameters  @xcite .",
    "the molecular structure of water confined in nanotubes and the diffusion can be very different depending on the chosen water model to perform the simulations  @xcite .",
    "this difference arises as a consequence of the fact that the water models used in classical all - atoms md simulations , like spc / e , tip3p , tip4p , etc , are parametrized for bulk simulations , and for reproduce only few aspects of real water .",
    "so this models may show errors to describe the correct water behavior under strongly confinement , like inside nanotubes .",
    "the behavior of the diffusion coefficient with the nanotube radius is still under debate .",
    "some simulations show a monotonical decrease of @xmath4 with decreasing nanotube radius  @xcite while other simulations indicate the presence of a minimum  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the length of the nanotube and the length of the simulation would be responsible for the different results  @xcite and that friction should play also a relevant role  @xcite .",
    "our core - softened model introduced to study bulk system does not have any directionality and therefore it is not water .",
    "however , it does exhibit the density , the diffusion and the response functions anomalies observed in water .",
    "this suggests that some of the anomalous properties that are attributed directionality of water can be found in spherical symmetry systems .",
    "likewise , here we propose that also the minimum in the diffusion coefficient as the nanotube radius is decreased observed for water can be also found in spherical symmetric systems .    in order to check our hypothesis , we model a water - like fluid into a nanotube using a core - softened potential .",
    "we test if this model is capable to capture the increase in the diffusion coefficient when the channel radius decreases .",
    "next , we verify if the layering and the structure formed inside the channel , observed in some classical models for confined liquid water , has an universal feature or if it is just a consequence of the specific confining surface and model details .",
