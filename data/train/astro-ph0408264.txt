    "one of the main characteristics of an extragalactic radio source is the shape of the broad band spectrum , which provides a considerable amount of physical information about the object .",
    "the extragalactic radio sources are often separated into different samples on the basis of the shape of the spectra ( e.g. flat , inverted , steep , gigahertz peaked spectrum sources ) .",
    "this shows the importance of the multifrequency broad band spectra surveys of compact extragalactic objects among long term flux variability monitoring programs ( e.g. aller et al .",
    "@xcite , mitchell et al .",
    "@xcite , stevens et al .",
    "@xcite , etc . ) and vlbi imaging surveys ( e.g. kellermann et al .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "most of the earlier multifrequency spectra results were obtained by combining measurements carried out quasi - simultaneously ( over a period of one or more months ) at radio and shorter wavelengths , using several telescopes on some samples of tens of objects , selected by various criteria .",
    "for example , we refer to the measurements of 19  active extragalactic sources from 20  cm to 1400   by landau et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "valtaoja et al .",
    "( @xcite ) investigated quiescent spectra for a sample of 27  radio sources observed at centimeter and millimeter wavelengths .",
    "gear et al .",
    "( @xcite ) compared quasi - simultaneous 5375  ghz spectra of 22  bl  lacertae objects with 24  radio - loud , violently variable quasars .",
    "khr et al .",
    "( @xcite ) compiled radio measurements at more than two frequencies for 494  sources from the combined nrao  mpi 5  ghz strong source surveys and the parkes 2.7  ghz surveys .",
    "herbig & readhead  ( @xcite ) composed non - simultaneous radio data from 10  mhz to 100  ghz on a complete sample of 256  objects .",
    "we also refer to papers , cited in the odea  ( @xcite ) survey of compact steep - spectrum and gigahertz peaked - spectrum sources , as well as a number of other works .",
    "some earlier ratan600 results on broad band spectra observations were presented for samples from 8.7  ghz zelenchuk sky survey by amirkhanyan et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and 87 gb survey by mingaliev & khabrakhmanov  ( @xcite ) , for strong compact extragalactic objects by kovalev et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and weak radio sources from the ratan600  cold \" deep sky survey by bursov  ( @xcite ) .    a broad band spectrum of a compact extragalactic radio source is usually considered to be the sum of spectra of several compact and extended components in a source structure .",
    "the components are located at various distances from the central nucleus of the object , and are likely to have resulted from activity within the nucleus .",
    "the nucleus may be a black hole , which converts an accreted ambient gas to ejected relativistic particles along magnetic fields .",
    "some of the components can be variable in time .",
    "the variability can misrepresent the true shape of a spectrum if measurements at all or especially high frequencies are not simultaneous .    in this work we present observational results of more than five hundred sources at six frequencies from 1 to 22  ghz using a single radio telescope .",
    "flux densities at all frequencies are measured practically instantaneously   over a period of a few minutes .",
    "this is the shortest time scale of broad band six frequency measurements for the largest sample of sources so far , which has been used for a spectra survey of compact extragalactic radio sources .",
    "these observations are part of a long - term program of instantaneous spectra monitoring of compact extragalactic objects ( kovalev  @xcite ) , which have milliarcsecond components and are studied by vlbi networks .",
    "they also give a ground spectra support for the vsop survey and a pre - launch spectra study of the objects for the radioastron project .",
    "the goal of the long - term program is a mass study of the spectra and their variability for many hundreds of compact extragalactic radio sources .",
    "it is also among our intentions to find a relationship between instantaneous multifrequency spectra and the vlbi radio structure .",
    "we have selected about 700  sources from the preston et al .",
    "( @xcite ) vlbi survey .",
    "these sources have a correlated flux density @xmath2  jy at the wavelength of 13  cm , and are located north of declination @xmath0",
    ". the northern sector of ratan600 restricts this declination range from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "measurements of the sources located north of declination @xmath3 were made in 1998 with the southern sector of ratan600 and will be published at a later date .    the list of 551 sources for northern sector observations is presented in table  [ list_table ] .",
    "the columns of this table are as follows : ( 1 ) the iau name , ( 2 ) possible other name , ( 3 ) the optical identification ( oi ) and ( 4 ) the redshift . the oi and redshifts",
    "are taken from veron  cetty & veron ( @xcite ) or , if not found there , are taken from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "the abbreviations used are  q \" for quasars ,  bl \" for bl  lacertae objects ,  g \" for galaxies ,  rs \" for radio sources . in the latter case we do not have oi .",
    "an extended version of this table is available in electronic form at the cds .",
    "this also includes b1950 coordinates taken from preston et al .",

    "we performed continuous six frequency 122 ghz spectra observations of compact extragalactic sources from 1st to 22nd december , 1997 .",
    "we used the 600  meter ring radio telescope ratan600 ( korolkov & parijskij  @xcite , parijskij  @xcite ) at the russian academy of sciences special astrophysical observatory , located in karachaevo - cherkessia republic ( russia ) near nizhny arkhyz and zelenchukskaya at the north caucasus .",
    "the northern sector of the antenna ( a part of the main ring reflector ) was used together with the secondary mirror of cabin no .  1",
    ". six broad band receivers are located at this movable cabin .",
    "the cabin moves along 150  meter long rails in order to be placed in the focus of the antenna system at different elevations .",
    "the main ( meridional ) transit method of observation was employed .",
    "accuracy and reliability of these spectra measurements were essentially higher than earlier experiments conducted at the ratan600 due to the following improvements made to the receivers , antenna control system and the procedure of observations ."
