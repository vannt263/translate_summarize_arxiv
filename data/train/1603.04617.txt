    "over the last several decades the study of interplay of noise and nonlinearity has become a major subject of research in various multidisciplinary areas@xcite .",
    "these studies include the noise induced directed transport , stochastic resonance , noise induced stability of unstable states , noise induced phase transition , noise induced ordering etc . in most of the above mentioned cases the presence of noise is very much essential . in the literature ,",
    "the noise induced directed transport in periodic extended structures in the absence of overall net bias has been extensively studied .",
    "two basic ingredients are required for the posilibity of such directed transport , namely , the system should be driven out of equilibrium and there should be some asymmetry ( either temporal or spatial ) along with nonlinearity in the system .",
    "the systems consisting of brownian particles and operating with the minimal conditions for such directed transport are known as brownian ratchets / brownian motors @xcite .",
    "there is increasing interest from physicists , biologists and engineers on the study of so called ratchets or brownian motors @xcite .",
    "based on the various ways of introducing the asymmetry or nonlinearity in the systems , there are various kinds of brownian ratchet models like flashing ratchets , rocking ratchets , time - asymmetric ratchets and inhomogeneous ratchets@xcite .    the main motivation in the study of performance characteristics of brownian ratchet is the notion of efficiency of energy transduction from the thermal fluctuations @xcite . with the help of stochastic energetic formalism @xcite proposed by sekimoto , efficiency can be defined in a wide class of ratchet models @xcite .",
    "different kinds of efficiency ( thermodynamic , stoke s and generalized ) for ratchet models have been studied in detail both analytically and numerically . since the brownian ratchet operates out of equilibrium , there is always an unavoidable heat transfer to the medium / environment , which makes it to be less efficient .",
    "it has been noticed that brownian motors based on the principle of flashing ratchet models result in low efficiency . on the other hand , brownian motors based on the adiabatically changing potentials , e.g. , rocked ratchet models exhibit high value in efficiency @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we are mainly interested in the case of spatial asymmetric rocked ratchet models .    in all kinds of ratchet models ,",
    "it is to be emphasized that the brownian particle moves in a periodic potential system and hence it ends up with the same potential energy even after crossing over to the adjacent potential minimum .",
    "hence there is no extra energy stored in the particle which can be used for a given purpose . in order to extract work / energy out of it s motion ,",
    "it is necessary to apply an external load force against which the particle moves and stores energy in the form of potential energy @xcite . in this context the efficiency of the ratchet can be defined as the output work against the load force per input energy given to the system .",
    "this definition of efficiency is called as thermodynamic efficiency and it s value is zero when there is no applied load in the ratchet @xcite .",
    "the ratchets are not designed to lift the load all the time . alternatively , there are various ways of defining the efficiency in the ratchet based on the purpose of the work given to the ratchet . in this work ,",
    "we are mainly interested in the notion of stoke s efficiency , which is defined as the ratio of the rate of work done against the mean viscous drag and the rate of input energy given to the ratchet @xcite .",
    "the brownian ratchets operate at microscopic length scale . for the systems operating at this length scale , the energy exchanged ( i.e. , in the form of mechanical energy , chemical energy etc . ) between the system and it s environment is of the order of thermal energy ( few @xmath2 , @xmath3 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath4 being the temperature ) . thermal fluctuations play a predominant role , thereby exhibiting distinctly different behavior from that of macro systems @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we are mainly interested in the study of fluctuating properties of stoke s efficiency in case of a spatial and temporal asymmetric rocked ratchet model .",
    "recently the enhancement of stoke s efficiency by noise was studied in a microscale domain @xcite . in this study , we are mainly interested on the stochastic properties of stoke s efficiency and it s probability distribution from adiabtic to nonadiabatic limit . we show that in most of the parameter space , fluctuations dominate the mean values .",
    "as we increase the frequency of the drive the mean stoke s efficiency and the average current decreases .     and the external time asymmetric driving force @xmath5 as a function of @xmath6 . , width=288,height=240 ]",
    "we consider the dynamics of an overdamped brownian particle in a periodic spatial asymmetric ratchet potential @xmath7 in the presence of an external time asymmetric driving force @xmath5 .",
    "the motion is governed by the overdamped langevin equation @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the instantaneous position of the particle and @xmath10 being the friction coefficient .",

    "we study the unidirectional current as well as the stoke s efficiency in the adiabatic as well as nonadiabatic regimes .",
    "we show that in general the current decreases as we shift from adiabatic to nonadiabatic regime .",
    "for the first time we have also studied the nature of the stochastic stoke s efficiency , @xmath1 and it s fluctuations .",
    "we show that in general average stoke s efficiency , @xmath36 is not a good physical variable because fluctuations dominate the mean values .",

    "when the noise strength is very low , i.e. , in the deterministic limit there exists potential barriers for the motion of the brownian particle in both forward as well as backward directions .",
    "the potential barrier in the forward direction disappears only when the driving force in the forward direction is larger than the force exerted by the barrier towards the right of the potential , i.e. , when @xmath53 .",
    "similarly the barrier in the backward direction disappears only when @xmath54",
    ". hence there are critical forces , @xmath55 and @xmath56 beyond which the barrier disappears in both forward as well as backward direction .",
    "it implies that a finite current exists in the ratchet only when the amplitude of driving , @xmath57 is in between @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "when barrier disappears in the backward direction , there is a finite current in the backward direction resulting a negative contribution in the net current , @xmath28 in the ratchet . in the deterministic limit ,",

    "also we observe that the average current , @xmath28 and average stoke s efficiency @xmath36 show peaking behaviour with temperature , @xmath4 .",
    "the stoke s efficiency @xmath36 follows the same behaviour of average current @xmath28 .",
    "however , from fig.7(a ) and 7(b ) , we notice that there exists a finite current and finite stoke s efficiency even at zero temperature .",
    "this is because of the absence of potential barrier in the forward direction even at zero temperature . in this fixed parameter regime , the crictical value of @xmath57 , @xmath85 and hence @xmath86 .",

    "the average current , @xmath28 ( fig.8(a ) ) and average stoke s efficiency , @xmath36 ( fig.8(b ) ) increase with increase in spatial asymmetry , @xmath90 .",

    "this results in a finite positive contribution to the net current in the ratchet and hence to the average stoke s efficiency , @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , in this given parameter regime , for a spatial asymmetry ratchet potential , the magnitude of average current is quite larger than that in case of a symmetric ratchet potential and hence the spatial asymmetry in the ratchet helps in enhancing the stoke s efficiency .",
    "however , the relative fluctuations , @xmath77 ( fig .",
    "8(c ) ) shows a decreasing behaviour with increase in spatial asymmetry , @xmath90 , and become less than @xmath22 for larger spatial asymmetry in the potential .",

    "this is because with increase in frequency of drive , the forcing amplitude varies so fast that , the particle is not able to take the advantage of force in either of the direction and the movement of the particle towards the nearest neighbouring potential minima is suppressed .",
    "this decreases the net current as well as the average stoke s efficiency .",
    "for very high frequency of driving , the forcing amplitude varies so fast that the particle does nt feel the influence of forcing .",
    "the particle as if stays at one position only and hence the net current , @xmath28 and the average stoke s efficiency approaches to zero .",
