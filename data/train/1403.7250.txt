    "the eigenvalues of @xmath5 are isolated poles of @xmath53 scattered in the complex plane . for @xmath56",
    "the eigenvalues coalesce and define a nonholomorphic region . like the symmetric case @xcite",
    ", an infinitesimal @xmath57 is needed to allow for analytic continuation to the nonholomorphic region .",
    "our goal is to calculate @xmath53 which is still complicated due to the non - gaussian probability associated to the distribution of the matrix elements of @xmath5 . to simplify the problem we use a trick of linearization , as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which unfolds the problem as linear in @xmath3 and @xmath1 and consequently simplifies the binary correlation method @xcite in a straightforward manner .",
    "we emphasize that our results are valid in the same limit as has been addressed in ref .",

    "however , for @xmath92 , we shall also use @xmath93 in what follows , we ignore @xmath94 terms in the ensemble averaging while keeping only the leading order terms .",

    "both densities are symmetric along both axes .",

    "to summarize the work , we begin with a few important remarks . in physics , nonsymmetric random matrices have been of importance from different perspectives @xcite . for the correlation matrices , however , these are important in order to understand time evolution of a multivariate complex system or to understand mutual behaviour of two different statistical systems .",
    "usually , wishart s approach is used in dressing the noise from an empirical correlation matrix where the spectral analysis plays a crucial role .",
    "theory incorporating linear correlations , however , provides a better way of understanding effects of the actual correlations in the spectral statistics .",
    "the importance is evident from refs .",
    "@xcite . from the theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "there remain many problems like obtaining the finite-@xmath6 results where some methods developed for the correlated wishart ensembles @xcite seem potentially useful .    in this paper",
    "we have focused mainly on the domain of the bulk of complex eigenvalues under the influence of actual correlations .",
    "we have derived analytic result for the contour enclosing the bulk of the eigenvalues for a general @xmath13 for which the full correlation matrix @xmath25 is positive definite .",
    "one important finding here is the ellipse which explains the boundary of eigenvalues for a system dominated by autocorrelations of equal strength . beside that we have shown that the contour depends on the non - normality of the correlation matrix . in this paper , the results are illustrated using tridiagonal @xmath13 matrices , which are special but allows us to obtain analytical results , which may well be used in applications .",
    "also we have remarked that effects of the non - normality can also be observed in the singular values of @xmath13 , mostly for small or large eigenvalues .",
    "as far as applications are concerned , perhaps the closest example is in the quantitative finance where study of the correlations between stock prices with their volume data @xcite could be good starting point .",
    "however , the main emphasis has so far been the bi - variate time series @xcite .",
    "we believe that our results can be used for the multi - stock data analysis which may shed more light on the non - trivial behavior of the financial market .",
    "finally , we believe that our results may not be confined to the multivariate analysis as can be deduced from the historical developments and applications of rmt @xcite .",
