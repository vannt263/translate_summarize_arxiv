    "oxide epitaxy has made tremendous advances in the past 15 years . using techniques such as pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) and molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) ,",
    "oxide epitaxy has evolved from merely depositing material with the right crystal structure onto a substrate to growing the material in a layer - by - layer fashion .",
    "the latter allows interventions during the growth and therefore enables the creation of artificial materials .",
    "the progress in epitaxy is due not only to improvements in the growth systems and growth monitoring , but also to a better understanding of the ways materials influence each other during heteroepitaxy .",
    "research has shown that perovskite oxide epitaxial layers are influenced by the boundary conditions applied by the epitaxy process .",
    "properties are modified due to the presence of such phenomena as strain , polar discontinuities , and octahedral connectivity mismatch .",
    "this sensitivity offers the unique opportunity to engineer the materials structure . in this way",
    ", advanced epitaxy has become a research tool for understanding materials , because it allows different structural parameters to be disentangled .",
    "some examples of the possibilities of advanced epitaxy are : tricolor superlattices @xcite , compositional interface engineering @xcite , modulation doping @xcite , oxygen octahedra rotation engineering @xcite , interface dipole engineering @xcite , transfer of electron - phonon coupling @xcite , and defect mitigation @xcite .",
    "la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2  is interesting because it is a ferromagnetic metal with 100 % spin polarization @xcite .",
    "it is therefore relevant to a variety of devices such as magnetic tunnel juctions @xcite , diodes @xcite , transistors @xcite , and ferroelectric tunnel junctions @xcite .",
    "all of these applications require control of the properties of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2  at the interface .",
    "the half - metallic state in la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2  arises from a complex balance between competing interactions .",
    "the double exchange interaction favors conductivity whereas the superexchange interaction favors an insulating state .",
    "furthermore , the material is susceptible to jahn - teller distortions that also favor electron localization .",
    "all these factors depend on the local crystal environment of the mn ions . at interfaces the balance between the competing interactions",
    "is modified and an electrical and magnetic dead - layer is present @xcite .    here we present a study of different interface engineering schemes for la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2  interfaces with a focus on the la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2srtio@xmath2  interface .",
    "the goal is to systematically investigate different mechanisms thought to be responsible for the dead - layer behavior . in the following sections we discuss the polar discontinuity problem , the effect of disorder , and the oxygen octahedra rotations .",
    "srtio@xmath2  substrates were prepared using a standard bhf etching procedure @xcite .",
    "the la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2  thin films were grown with pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) ( tsst system ) .",
    "the substrate temperature during growth was 750 - 800 @xmath3c in an oxygen environment of 0.27 mbar .",
    "the laser beam was produced by a 248-nm - wavelength krf excimer laser ( lpxpro@xmath4 from coherent , inc . ) with a typical pulse duration of 20 - 30 ns . with a 4 by 15",
    "mm rectangular mask the most homogeneous part of the laser beam was selected .",
    "a sharp image of the mask was created on the stoichiometric target ( praxair electronics ) with a lens , resulting in a spotsize of 2.3 mm@xmath5 ( 0.9 by 2.5 mm ) .",
    "the beam energy was controlled with a variable attenuator or with the laser voltage , yielding a fluence at the target of 2 j / cm@xmath5 .",
    "the repetition rate was 1 hz and the substrate was placed at 5 cm distance directly opposite to the target . before deposition , the target was pre - ablated for 2 minutes at 5 hz to remove any possible surface contamination .",
    "after deposition , the pld chamber was flooded with pure oxygen ( typically 100 mbar ) and the samples were cooled down by switching of the heater power . typically , the cooldown required 2 hours . for the pld growth of srtio@xmath2  and srmno@xmath2 ,",
    "identical settings were used as for the la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2  growth . for the latio@xmath2 growth , and the growth of the srtio@xmath2  layer on top of the latio@xmath2 ,",
    "the deposition pressure was lowered to 3@xmath7 mbar , in order to prevent the formation of la@xmath8ti@xmath8o@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "some of the thicker la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2  films were grown with a repetition rate of 5 hz and an oxygen pressure of 0.16 mbar .",
    "the magnetization of the samples was measured with a vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) ( physical properties measurement system ( ppms ) by quantum design ) . in order to determine the saturation magnetization and curie temperature unambiguously ,",
    "magnetic hysteresis loops were obtained at all temperatures as discussed in detail in the supplementary information of @xcite .",
    "the resistivity of the samples was measured in the van der pauw configuration @xcite ( ppms by quantum design ) . in order to obtain ohmic contacts between the aluminium bonding wires and the la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2  layer ,",
    "gold contacts were deposited on the corners of the sample with the use of a shadow mask .",
    "the electric field gating experiments were performed with a backgate geometry , using the 0.5 mm substrate as a gate dielectric . in order to ensure a uniform electric field , the back of the substrate",

    ". the side spots are doubled , which is due to the additional periodicity at the surface from the regularly spaced terrace steps .",
    "figure  [ rheedini ] , top right , shows the rheed image of the la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2  film after the deposition of 5 unit cell layers .",
    "clear two dimensional spots are visible , but also 2d streaks are present .",
    "the latter are attributed to the scattering of the rheed beam off the unit cell high steps at the surface .",
    "similar rheed images were observed after the completion of films with thicknesses up to 40 nm .",
    "the main graph in fig .  [ rheedini ] shows the intensity of the specular reflection as measured during the initial growth of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 .",
    "the intensity shows oscillations which correspond to the growth of the individual unit cell layers . within the oscillations ,",
    "recovery of the intensity after the sudden decrease during the laser burst is observed , as shown more clearly in the inset of the graph .",
    "the oscillation amplitude decreases with the amount of material deposited during the first part of the growth .",
    "this decrease of the intensity is due to the difference in reflectivity of the srtio@xmath2  surface and the la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2  surface , due to the increased scattering from the heavy la ions in the lattice .",
    "finally , the full width at the half maximum ( fwhm ) of the intensity of the specular spot , measured along the ( 10 ) direction , is presented as well . during the growth ,",
    "the rheed spots are periodically more streaky , because more stepedge scattering is present at half unit cell layer coverage compared to full unit cell layer coverage .",
    "therefore , the fwhm oscillates as well .",
    "the fwhm depends only on the shape of the intensity distribution and not on the total intensity and it is therefore a better indicator of the surface morphology than the main intensity of the reflection . as can be seen in the figure , the fwhm during the growth is almost equal to the fwhm of the substrate reflection indicating a smooth surface morphology . from these measurements",
    "it is concluded that the initial stage of the la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2  growth proceeds in the ideal 2d layer - by - layer growth mode .    during the growth of the film , an increase of the rheed oscillation maximum intensity",
    "was observed , as presented in fig .",
    "[ rheed25 ] .",
    "the oscillation intensity maximum typically peaked around 20 to 25 unit cell layers .",
    "the maximum in intensity was not observed during growth on an @xmath13-site terminated substrate surface , so it might indicate a termination conversion .",
    "after this peak the oscillation intensity maximum decreased rapidly and the oscillation amplitude became comparable to the intensity variations in the laser pulse recovery cycles .",
    "it is concluded that the la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2  growth mode during the latter part of the growth is close to the steady state growth mode which is characterized by a relatively constant step density , which is large compared to the step density of the initial substrate surface .        in order to check the hypothesis about a termination conversion during growth , three samples with",
    "respectively a 20 , 26 and 30 unit - cell - thick la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2  layer were measured with angle - dependent time - of - flight mass spectroscopy .",
    "the relative intensity of the mn ions with respect to sr and la is shown in fig .",
    "the strong angular dependence in the mn / la ratio of the 20 unit - cell - thick sample is consistent with a dominant mno@xmath8 crystal termination . with increasing film thickness",
    "the angular dependence is reduced indicating a reduction of the mno@xmath8 termination .",
    "the data is more consistent with a mixed termination for the thicker films than with a complete surface termination conversion .",
    "the mn / sr ratio has a similar angular dependence , although the magnitude of the signal is reduced .",
    "the lower mn / sr ratio compared to mn / la is also seen in experiments using controlled @xmath13o and @xmath14o@xmath8 terminated la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2  films @xcite . in conclusion , the surface termination changes around 26 unit cells towards mixed termination , in agreement with the deductions from the growth analysis .",
