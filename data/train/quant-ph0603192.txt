    "optical coherence properties of rare - earth - ion - doped ( re - ion - doped ) inorganic crystals have been thoroughly investigated for photon - echo based optical data storage and data processing over several decades @xcite .",
    "these materials have interesting low - temperature properties such as small homogeneous linewidths ( i. e. long coherence times ) and large inhomogeneous broadening ( i. e. large frequency bandwidths ) .",
    "coherent optical control of re - ions doped into solids has gained further interest in recent years as a result of original proposals in the fast developing fields of quantum communication and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "in particular , re - ions in crystals are promising for the realization of a reversible transfer of quantum states between photons and atoms / ions .",
    "such a quantum memory represents a basic building block for the so - called quantum repeater @xcite , allowing the extension of quantum communication schemes such as quantum cryptography @xcite to very long distances .",
    "+ an interesting new approach to a memory for quantum as well as for classical light in solid state materials is based on controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening ( crib ) of a narrow , spectrally isolated absorption line @xcite .",
    "one of the major challenges in implementing this protocol is the need for an optically thick atomic medium , with long optical coherence times .",
    "the exact requirements for an efficient crib based quantum memory are still subject to research , but it seems reasonable to assume that optical depths of a few hundred ( @xmath3 100 ) , and coherence times longer than a microsecond will be necessary @xcite .",
    "+ however , large optical depths and long coherence times are difficult to obtain simultaneously . although coherence times longer than a few ms have been observed @xcite , these demonstrations normally rely on weakly doped crystals in order to reduce re ion - ion interactions .",
    "typical absorption coefficients in weakly doped bulk crystals are of the order of 1 - 10 @xmath4 . because interaction lengths are normally limited to a few millimeters , by focusing requirements , the corresponding small optical depths will limit the efficiency of crib - based quantum state storage @xcite .",
    "+ in this article we investigate the coherence properties of an er@xmath1-doped silicate fiber at low temperatures , specifically with respect to the requirements for crib .",
    "this system is promising for the realization of crib , as arbitrarily large optical depths can be achieved with low doping concentration through long interaction lengths .",
    "also , the @xmath5 transition in erbium corresponds to a wavelength of 1532 nm ( between the two lowest crystal - field levels ) , thus allowing future interfacing of optical quantum memories with the standard telecommunication fiber networks .",
    "+ at low temperature , the magnitude and temperature dependence of the homogeneous linewidth differs significantly between re - ions in amorphous disordered materials and in crystalline hosts .",
    "the optical decoherence times are much shorter and quasi - linearly dependent on the temperature",
    ". these properties of amorphous systems , for example glasses , are due to coupling between the re - ion impurity and a broad distribution of low - frequency tunneling modes ( two - level systems or tls ) , which are normally not present in crystals .",
    "although much research has been done to better understand the low - temperature properties of re - ion - doped glasses @xcite , there are still open questions concerning the exact temperature dependence of the homogeneous linewidth and its origin . in recent photon - echo experiments in a er@xmath1-doped silicate fiber @xcite , a new magnetic - field - dependent optical dephasing process was observed .",
    "it was proposed that the field - dependent dephasing is caused by coupling of the large electronic spin of erbium to tls modes of magnetic character .",
    "magnetic tls modes have also been considered in the field of glassy low - temperature physics , including dielectric echo experiments @xcite .",
    "we investigated a single - mode er@xmath1-doped silicate glass fiber ( er 407 from ino , canada ) , co - doped as follows : er 0.07 at % , al 2.65 at % , ge 3.62 at % .",
    "the length of the fiber was 70 cm , corresponding to an optical depth of @xmath6 = 0.9 at 1532 nm and 4 k. for measurements between temperatures of 10 k and 2.6 k the fiber was rolled around a copper cylinder ( diameter = 4 cm ) and fixed with adhesive tape to ensure a good thermal contact .",
    "the cylinder was fixed to the cold finger of a pulse tube cooler ( vericold technologies ) .",
    "the er@xmath1-doped fiber was fusion spliced to standard single - mode fibers , which were in good thermal contact with the cold finger . for measurements at temperatures",
    "lower than 2.6 k an identical fiber was installed in a similar setup in a home - built @xmath7he/@xmath8he dilution refrigerator where it was cooled to temperatures down to 60 mk .",
    "a superconducting magnet inside this refrigerator enabled us to apply magnetic fields of up to 2 tesla .",
    "+ to measure the homogeneous linewidth @xmath9 , or the corresponding decoherence time ( lifetime ) @xmath10 , over a wide range of temperatures and external magnetic fields , we performed both spectral hole burning and photon echo measurements @xcite .",
    "the spectral hole burning technique directly yields the homogeneous linewidth , however , it is limited by laser frequency fluctuations during the measurement ( in our case typically 0.5 - 1 mhz ) .",
    "two - pulse photon echoes are generally more robust against laser frequency fluctuations , if the fluctuations are small compared to the frequency bandwidths of the optical pulses .",
    "the two - pulse photon echo technique is therefore the preferred approach for measuring homogeneous linewidths below 1 mhz ( corresponding to more than a 318 ns decoherence time ) .",
    "however , decoherence times below approximately 100 ns are difficult to measure , as the requisite short pulses having sufficiently high peak intensities are difficult to obtain .",
    "in addition to these technical issues , spectral hole burning and two - pulse photon echo experiments often yield different decoherence times , as spectral diffusion @xcite leads to an apparent time - dependent homogeneous linewidth .",
    "spectral diffusion has a larger impact on the linewidth obtained by spectral hole burning , as such experiments are performed on a longer time scale than two - pulse photon echoes .",
    "the lifetime obtained by two - pulse photon echo experiments is often referred to as the intrinsic lifetime . to study decoherence over a wide range of times ,",
    "the three - pulse photon echo technique can be used @xcite .",
    "the experiments that we describe in this article employed all three of these techniques .      to measure the homogeneous linewidth @xmath11 of a transition in an ensemble of inhomogeneously broadened absorbers ,",
    "a laser having a frequency bandwidth small compared to the homogeneous linewidth is used to selectively excite ions , thereby creating a spectral hole in the absorption .",
    "its width can be measured by scanning the laser frequency across its initial value and measuring the transmitted light intensity .",
    "note that the @xmath12 is typically much weaker than the _",
    "excitation pulse_. + the output from an external - cavity diode cw laser ( toptica dl 100 ) was gated by two standard fiber - optic intensity modulators ( avanex sd 20 and im10 ) in order to vary the laser intensity between excitation and measurement .",
    "the first modulator created the two pulses , whereas the second modulator suppressed the laser light between two consecutive excitation / measurement sequences . a stanford delay generator ( dg 535 ) triggered the sequence with a frequency of 10 hz , the duration of the excitation pulse being typically 200 @xmath0s and the measurement time being typically 1 ms ( short compared to the radiative lifetime of @xmath1310 ms ) .",
    "the light was then coupled into the er@xmath1-doped fiber inside the refrigerator , and a fiber - coupled photodiode ( newfocus , mod .",
    "2011v ) detected the signal at the output of the refrigerator .",
    "note that the whole setup relied on telecommunication fiber - technology .      in a two - pulse photon echo ( 2pe ) experiment , a first pulse , ideally a @xmath14 pulse ,",
    "excites the atoms into a coherent superposition of the ground and excited state , forming an atomic coherence . with time",
    ", inhomogeneous broadening leads to rapid inhomogeneous dephasing .",
    "application of a second pulse after a time @xmath15 , ideally a @xmath16-pulse , reverses the inhomogeneous dephasing , thereby forming a photon echo a time @xmath15 after the second pulse .",
    "the homogeneous dephasing , which can not be reversed by the second pulse , leads to an exponential decay of the 2pe peak intensity as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "a three - pulse photon echo ( 3pe ) can be seen as an extension of a 2pe , where the second pulse is divided into two @xmath14-pulses , separated by a variable delay @xmath17 . in a 3pe",
    "the first pulse creates an atomic coherence , but the second pulse transfers the coherence into a frequency - dependent population grating in the ground and excited states .",
    "the third pulse scatters off the grating , forming an echo a time @xmath15 after the third pulse . in absence of spectral diffusion @xcite",
    ", the grating decays with the radiative lifetime @xmath18 , approximately 10 ms in the case of er@xmath1 doped silicate fibers .",
    "+ to perform 2pe ( or 3pe ) experiments , we used a setup similar to the one employed in the shb experiments .",
    "two ( or three ) short pulses were created by the optical intensity modulators ( ims ) .",
    "the two ims were synchronized and acted in series in order to have a good peak - to - background intensity ratio .",
    "the excitation pulses had durations of t@xmath19=13 ns and t@xmath20=20 ns , with a repetition frequency of 10 hz .",
    "the pulses were then amplified by an optical amplifier ( variable gain edfa , trillium photonics , fam c1725-a ) . in order to avoid excessive heating of the refrigerator due to amplified spontaneous emission from the amplifier , emitted between consecutive photon echo excitation sequences",

    "the resulting peak powers were in the range of 100 - 200 mw at the refrigerator input .",
    "owing to a good extinction of the background light ( @xmath21 33 db ) , the temperature could be stabilized at 150 mk and above .",

    "the associated decay time @xmath34 is directly connected to the lifetime through the relation @xmath35 . in all our 2pe measurements , however , we observed strong sinusoidal modulations during the first 100 - 200 ns of the decay curve ( see inset of fig .",

    "these modulations can be explained by coherent excitations of several transitions in the atoms , as has been observed previously @xcite .",

    "+ in order to investigate the role of spectral diffusion , we performed 3pe measurements . the effect of spectral diffusion on the 3pe process is to reduce the modulation depth in the population grating by `` smearing '' it out in frequency space , thus reducing the efficiency of the echo formation . in fig .",
    "[ 3pulse ] the 3pe peak intensity is plotted as a function of the delay time @xmath17 between the second and the third pulse , while the distance between the first two pulses was kept constant at @xmath15=50 ns .",

    "as the excited state lifetime is around 10 ms , much longer than the observed fast decay , this measurement clearly indicates that spectral diffusion plays an important role on a microsecond timescale .",
    "after 200 @xmath43 , however , the spectral diffusion reaches a maximum ( corresponding to a time - independent homogeneous linewidth ) , and the 3pe peak intensity relaxes with a time constant of around 7 ms , approximately equal to the excited state lifetime of around 10 ms .",
    "a similar behavior has been observed previously by broer et al.@xcite in 3pe experiments with a nd@xmath1-doped silica fiber .",
    "the temperature dependence of the homogeneous linewidth measured by shb at temperatures above 2 k with zero magnetic field , and above 0.5 k and 1.3 tesla follows a power - law of @xmath44 and of @xmath45 , respectively ( see fig . [",

    "flipping of a tls through phonon interaction leads to a change in the optical transition frequency of the neighboring re - ions , resulting in an optical dephasing . assuming the standard approximations in existing models to be correct @xcite the temperature dependence for an electric dipole - dipole interaction between the tls and the re - ion should be of the form @xmath46 .",

    "the differences can be explained by a different glass composition , by the use of a different re - ion , as has been suggested by @xcite , or by the use of 2pe measurements as compared to our shb measurements .",
    "+ the aforementioned model predicts a decrease of linewidth down to arbitrarily small values when decreasing the temperature .",
    "in contrast to this , our measurements without applied magnetic field clearly showed the existence of a temperature independent linewidth below 2k ( see fig .",
    "[ allt ] ) .",
    "surprisingly , application of a magnetic field allowed us to reduce the linewidths by 8 - 10 mhz .",
    "the relative narrowing is particularly pronounced at temperatures below 2k , but was also observed at a temperature of 4k .",
    "although a similar , however less pronounced effect is known to exist in re crystals @xcite , this behavior has only very recently been observed in a glass by macfarlane _",
    "the field - dependent narrowing can not be explained by standard models of coupling of the re - ion to tls modes .",
    "furthermore , as has been pointed out in @xcite this effect is not likely to originate from magnetic dipole - dipole interaction between er@xmath1 ions , as is typical in er@xmath1-doped inorganic crystals @xcite , since the contribution from spin - spin interactions is only of the order of 100 khz at similar er@xmath1 concentrations .",
    "instead proposed that the large electronic spin of er@xmath1 ions couples to tls modes having a magnetic character . to describe the magnetic - field dependent dephasing",
    "the authors used a phenomenological thermal activation law @xmath50 where @xmath22 is the magnetic field , @xmath51 the bohr magneton , @xmath52 an effective @xmath53 factor of the spin system and @xmath54 the magnetic field independent tls part defined above . fitting this expression to the homogeneous linewidths in fig .",
    "[ allt]b , we obtained @xmath55 ( at 500 mk ) , similar to the value of @xmath52=3.2 given in @xcite .",
    "the general features of the magnetic field dependent linewidth ( fig .",
    "[ allt]b ) correspond well to the fitted curve .",
    "however , due to difficult - to - resolve , partly overlapping spectral holes at intermediate fields , we estimate the error in @xmath52 to be around 50@xmath23 . +",
    "our results confirm the recent observation of a strongly field - dependent , optical dephasing mechanism in re - ion - doped glasses and can support the hypothesis of magnetic tls modes .",
    "note that the magnetic character of tls modes has also been proposed to explain unusual magnetic field dependent dielectric properties of glasses as observed through dielectric polarization echoes @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to point out the possibility that clustering effects in er@xmath1 doped glasses @xcite might also contribute to the magnetic - field dependent dephasing .",
    "clustering leads to increased local er@xmath1 ion concentrations and thereby to enhanced spin - spin interactions as compared to crystals with similar mean ion concentration .",
    "erbium clustering is generally reduced by codoping with aluminium @xcite . yet",
    ", the only naturally abundant isotope of aluminium has a strong nuclear spin and is known to cause strong dephasing in re - ion - doped inorganic crystals @xcite .",
    "it would thus be interesting to study the optical dephasing in fibers having different erbium concentration , as well as different concentrations of co - dopants such as germanium , aluminium and lanthanum .",
    "+ the homogeneous lifetimes ( or linewidths ) that we measured via 2pe experiments at 0.6 t and above did not show a magnetic - field dependence , suggesting that a saturation limit was reached for the temperatures studied ( 150 mk , 300 mk and 500 mk ) .",
    "this is consistent with the shb measurements as a function of magnetic field ( see fib . [",
    "it should be noted , that extrapolating our 2pe results to temperatures between 1.5 and 4k yields homogeneous linewidths of the same order of magnitude as observed by macfarlane et al.@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ allt]a ) . yet , in order to compare the coherence properties of erbium in the two fibers having slightly different glass composition , measurements at the same temperature would be required .",
    "+ an interesting feature of our investigations is the large difference in homogeneous linewidths measured by 2pe as compared to the shb - technique . due to the resolution",
    "limit imposed by laser frequency fluctuations , this is best exemplified at 500 mk and 1.3 t , where the 2pe and shb measurements yielded 0.4@xmath56 and 1.6@xmath57 mhz , respectively .",
    "note that the second value is corrected for laser frequency fluctuations . as mentioned",

    "this value is in surprisingly close agreement with the linewidth of 1.6@xmath69 mhz that we measured by shb , supporting the previous conclusion that spectral diffusion can explain the difference between the shb and 2pe results .",
    "+ we conclude this discussion by comparing our results with other measurements carried out in er@xmath1-doped as well as in other re - ion - doped glasses .",
    "shb measurements on various re - ions in different host materials have generally resulted in larger homogeneous linewidths as compared to what is presented in this article ( see fig .",

    "furthermore , the coherence time is sufficiently long to transfer the optical coherences , after absorption of a photonic quantum state , into superpositions of different ground states with increased coherence times , thereby increasing the storage time .",
    "the application of a magnetic field also leads to a separation of the superhyperfine levels as required for the preparation of a single , homogeneously broadened , absorption line on a non - absorbing background with sufficiently large frequency bandwidth . in order to increase the bandwidth beyond the limit set by the er@xmath1-@xmath2al superhyperfine structure",

    "<S> we studied optical coherence properties of the 1.53 @xmath0 m telecommunication transition in an er@xmath1-doped silicate optical fiber through spectral holeburning and photon echoes . </S>",
    "<S> we find decoherence times of up to 3.8 @xmath0s at a magnetic field of 2.2 tesla and a temperature of 150 mk . </S>",
    "<S> a strong magnetic - field dependent optical dephasing was observed and is believed to arise from an interaction between the electronic er@xmath1 spin and the magnetic moment of tunneling modes in the glass . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we observed fine - structure in the erbium holeburning spectrum originating from superhyperfine interaction with @xmath2al host nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that er@xmath1-doped silicate fibers are promising material candidates for quantum state storage . </S>"
