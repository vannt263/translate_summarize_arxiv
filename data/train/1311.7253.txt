    "after nearly two decades intense study of the anomalous properties of high - tc superconductors ( hts ) , many important questions still remain open . among others , the nonmagnetic impurities effect on the cuprates has always attracted much attention @xcite .",
    "as we know , in the conventional s - wave superconductors , nonmagnetic impurities have little effect on the superfluid density and the transition temperature , which can be understood well from anderson theorem@xcite .",
    "however , for hts , it is found that such impurities can cause a strong pair - breaking effect@xcite , implying that hts have the unconventional , most likely d - wave pairing symmetry@xcite .",
    "so understanding of the effects of the nonmagnetic impurities on these materials provide us important information to understand the pairing mechanism in hts .",
    "experimentally , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) is an ideal technique for the study of such effects at the atomic scale@xcite . with the help of the high quality of the surface properties of the samples and the improvement of the experimental techniques , a great deal of reliable data",
    "have been obtained by different stm groups .",
    "it is found that away from the nonmagnetic impurity , the tunneling spectra show the typical asymmetric superconducting coherence peaks , and around the nonmagnetic impurity , strong intra - gap density of states peaks are induced at energies close to the fermi level , and at the same time the superconducting coherence peaks are strongly suppressed .    theoretically , it has been widely accepted that the essential physics of cuprates can be effectively described by the two - dimensional hubbard model or its equivalent t - j model in the large u limit .",
    "based on these models , especially the t - j - like models , a good deal of work has been carried out to study the nonmagnetic impurity effect on the cuprates@xcite . but as we know that in the t - j - like models , the virtual double occupancy is completely neglected , and this maybe leads not to describe the real detailed physics in these materials . in this case , laughlin proposed a new idea  gossamer superconductor \" to describe the physics of the hts @xcite . in the gossamer superconductor , even for the half filling , it may be a superconductor because of the double occupancy .",
    "stimulated by the laughlin s idea , anderson and ong@xcite proposed a new wave function to quantitatively explain the observed asymmetric tunneling conductivity in the stm within the gutzwiller - resonating valence bond theory @xcite .",
    "they believed that the asymmetries are predicted not to exist within the fermi liquid theory , and one needs to explain the stm results within the gutzwiller projected mean - field - theory .",
    "following above ideas , in this paper , we study the nonmagnetic impurity effect in the cuprate superconductor within the two - dimensional t - t-j - u model using the gutzwiller - projected mean - field - theory ( mft ) and the bogoliubov - de gennes theory@xcite .",
    "the order parameter ( op ) are determined self - consistently and the ldos is calculated numerically .",
    "we reproduced the main experimental results within our present theory .",
    "in the large u limit without electron double occupancy ( edo ) , far away from the local nonmagnetic impurity the ldos shows asymmetric superconducting coherence peaks . while around the nonmagnetic impurity , a zero - energy resonance peak in the ldos indeed appears when pushing the impurity potential into the unitary limit , and meanwhile the superconducting coherence peaks are strongly suppressed .",
    "we also find that with increasing the edo d which is directly modulated by coulomb repulsion u , the op gradually decreases and the resulting superconducting coherence peaks move to lower energies , while it is interesting to see the above zero - energy resonance peak begins to evolve into a double - peaked structure since a critical value @xmath0 .",
    "these novel feathers of asymmetric or splitting of the resonance state near fermi energy are qualitatively agreement with the stm experiments@xcite , and reveal the essential role played by the electron correlation in cuprate superconductors .",
    "we start from the t - t-j - u model on a square lattice @xcite , @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9(@xmath10 ) is the electron creation(annihilation ) operator , @xmath11 is spin operator with @xmath12 as the pauli matrices , @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the chemical potential , and @xmath4 is the on - site coulomb potential , which is introduced to partially impose the no - double - occupancy constraint for the strongly correlated system . in the limit u@xmath15 , the model is reduced to the t - j model .",
    "the scattering potential from the single - site impurity is modeled by @xmath16 with i the index for the impurity site .    to study the hamiltonian ( 1 ) with the gutzwiller variational approach , we take the trial wave function @xmath17 as @xmath18 is the bcs mean - field solution , and @xmath19 is the gutzwiller projection operator which is defined as @xmath20,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath21 is a variational parameter which takes the value between 0 and 1 .",
    "the choice @xmath22 corresponds to the situation with no doubly occupied sites(@xmath23 ) , while @xmath24 corresponds to the uncorrelated state(@xmath25 ) . with the help of the trial wave function and the gutzwiller approximation @xcite",
    ", we can get a gutzwiller renormalized hamiltonian@xcite , @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the renormalized factors in the gutzwiller approximation , @xmath29^{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath30^{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the electron number @xmath31 , and the double occupancy number @xmath32 at the site i. then using the mean - field approximation , we obtain a bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation , @xmath33 with @xmath34 in the above equations , we have introduced the electron pairing op and the bond op , @xmath35 which can be determined self - consistently as , @xmath36\\nonumber\\\\ n_{i}&=&\\sum_{n}|u_i^n|^2f(e_n)+\\sum_{n}|v_i^n|^2[1-f(e_n)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the fermi - dirac distribution function . in the numerical calculation , we construct a superlattice with the square lattice @xmath39 as a unit supercell . as detailed in ref . 7 , this method can provide the required energy resolution for the possible resonant states . throughout this paper , we take the size of the unit supercell @xmath40 , the number of supercell @xmath41 .",
    "then we can solve numerically the bdg equation and carry out an iteration until the selfconsistent equations are satisfied .",
    "hereafter , we set @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 for the band structure corresponding to the doping @xmath45 .",
    "the impurity potential @xmath46 is in the unitary limit .",
    "for the parameter @xmath47 in the large u limit . ]",
    "we firstly review the local electronic structure near a nonmagnetic impurity in the limit u@xmath15 , the model now is reduced to the t - t-j model and no edo is constraint . in fig . 1",
    ", we plot the obtained op .",
    "the spatial variation of the d - wave op defined as @xcite @xmath48,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is shown that because of the presence of the nonmagnetic impurity , the op is suppressed at the impurity site and recovers its bulk value over 2 - 3 lattice spacings .",
    "next we calculate the ldos as , @xmath49\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prefactor 2 comes from the spin summation , and @xmath50 is the derivation of the fermi distribution function @xmath51 . the ldos @xmath52(e ) is proportional to the local differential tunneling conductance which can be measured in a scanning tunneling microscope / spectroscopy experiment , so we can compare our calculated ldos with the stm results directly .     near the impurity site in the large u limit at @xmath53 . ]    the ldos spectra for different scattering potentials around the impurity site are plotted in fig .",
    "2 . for the site which locates far away from the impurity in fig . 2a",
    ", ldos displays the typical `` v''-shaped curve which has recovered the bulk dos , by exhibiting a gaplike feature at the gap edges .",
    "and especially we find that under the present gutzwiller - projector mfa , the ldos shows the particle - hole asymmetry which have been observed by the stm measurement . at impurity site ( not shown here ) , a single resonance state only appears at small scattering strengthen and is invisible with increasing @xmath54 due to the stronger impurity scattering . on the nearest - neighbor site of the impurity ( n.n ) as seen in fig .",
    "2b , it is shown that the superconducting coherence peaks are strongly suppressed , and quasiparticle resonance states at intragap energies are generated by a single nonmagnetic impurity .",
    "the details features are that for a moderately strong impurity @xmath55 , the asymmetric resonance states behave to be a double - peaked structure with the @xmath56 peak having the dominant spectral weight over the @xmath57 peak .",
    "while increasing the impurity strength pushes the resonance peaks toward the fermi level , so that in the unitary limit @xmath47 , the resonance state occurs right on the fermi energy , and only a single zero - energy resonance peak appears in the ldos near the impurity .",
    "it is also shown that the effect of the impurity is completely localized . to see clearly this point , we plot the spatial variation of the ldos at @xmath58 in the unitary limit in fig . 3 where we can see that the impurity - induced resonance state is indeed localized around the impurity .",
    "all the present results are consistent with the experimental data@xcite and previous theoretical calculations@xcite .     in the unitary limit . ]     at @xmath59 and @xmath47 .",
    "( b ) the d - wave op as a function of d. insert : the edo d as a function of u from ref . 29 . ]    . ]",
    "we now turn to investigate the effect of the coulomb repulsion u on the quasiparticle resonance states in the impurity scattering unitary limit .",
    "the average double occupation number d modulated by u has been studied by one of the authors@xcite , where they found that d decreased linearly with increasing coulomb repulsion u shown as an insert in fig .",
    "thus we can directly investigate the effect of the edo d on the ldos .",
    "the spatial variation of d - wave op with various @xmath60 at @xmath59 is self - consistently calculated in fig .",
    "4a , which indicates that with increasing edo @xmath60 ( decreasing coulomb repulsion u ) , the magnitude of order parameter gradually decreases seen in fig .",
    "4b . as a result , in fig .",
    "5 the corresponding position of the superconducting coherent peaks in ldos move to the lower energies with increasing d , while a single zero - energy impurity resonance peak always survives for small value of d , and begins to evolve into a double - peaked structure with negative energy peak having the dominant spectral weight over the positive energy peak since a critical double occupancy @xmath61 . these novel feathers of asymmetric or splitting of the resonance state in the impurity scattering unitary limit near fermi energy are qualitatively agreement with the stm experiments@xcite . since the d is modulated by the u , in the large u limit , the no double occupation ( @xmath60=0 ) constraint is satisfied for the strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "as u decreases , the electron double occupation is permitted and the electron correlation becomes weaker , the evolution of quasiparticle resonance states shown above qualitatively describes the effect of the electron correlation interactions on the stm . with the variation of the electron onsite coulomb interaction , the resonance states induced by the impurity",
    "would display different features , which in turn reflects the role played by electron correlation in various cuprate superconductors . in order to avoid the misunderstanding ,",
    "we stress here again that the evolution of double - peaked resonance into a single one as shown in fig .",
    "2 just depends on the impurity potential strength @xmath54 .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the ldos around a nonmagnetic impurity in the cuprate superconductors within the gutzwiller approximation and bogoliubov - de gennes theory .",
    "we reproduced the main related experimental results , that is , the asymmetric feature of the ldos , and impurity induced resonance states which are approximately localized around the impurity .",
    "in addition , considering the effect of the coulomb repulsion , we increase the edo d which is modulated by u , and find that the op gradually decreases and the resulting superconducting coherence peaks move to lower energies , while a unitary impurity induced single zero - energy resonance peak always survives for small value of d , and begins to evolve into a double - peaked structure since a critical double occupancy @xmath0 .",
