    "when a static uniform magnetic field is applied perpendicular to their most conducting plane , certain bechgaard salts undergo , at low temperatures , a transition from a metallic state to a cascade of field induced spin density wave ( fisdw ) semi - conducting states ; the latter exhibit a quantized hall effect@xcite .",
    "it is not fully recognized yet that this electron hole condensate is an original state of matter , which is neither a conventional density wave condensate nor a conventional quantum hall electronic liquid .",
    "the widely used phenomenological name of the phenomenon ( `` field induced spin density waves '' ) may be in part responsible for this oversight .",
    "this led one to propose the more correct name of `` ultra quantum crystal '' ( hereafter uqc)@xcite .",
    "indeed , in that system long range magnetic order ( quantum crystal ) sets in only because the unpaired carriers may form a few landau bands ( ultra quantum limit ) , while those landau bands may organize and stay completely filled as the field varies only because magnetic order sets in .",
    "the integer quantum hall effect observed in the bechgaard salts arises _ because of _ electron - electron interactions , in a three - dimensional material .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the integer quantum hall effect in the two - dimensional electron gas@xcite .",
    "a clear sign of the unconventional nature of the electron - hole condensate in the uqc is that its condensation energy per particle is much smaller than the orbital energy .",
    "this precludes a perturbation treatment of the orbital magnetism in the theoretical description of the condensed phase .",
    "collective modes of the uqc are the clearest evidence for the specificity of the electron - hole condensate@xcite .",
    "their spectrum exhibits an original structure in reciprocal space , with a series of local minima at multiples of @xmath1 , the magnetic wavevector , which recall the local minimum of the magneto - roton ( hereafter mr ) mode at the inverse magnetic length in the fractional quantum hall effect.@xcite .",
    "the mr modes result both from the orbital motion of electrons , and from the condensation of a density wave order parameter .",
    "one might navely think of them as some sort of kohn anomaly .",
    "however , kohn anomalies , in quasi 1d conductors , are phonon local minima in the normal phase , at the wave vector @xmath2 .",
    "they become soft at the metal - cdw transition .",
    "the magneto - roton modes of the uqc never become soft .",
    "they appear at quantized values of the wave vector parallel component @xmath3 , @xmath4 , or , as we shall see for the uqc phases called ribault phases , and which are characterized by a negative quantum hall number , at @xmath5 , with @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath1 is from three to two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath8 , depending on the magnetic field intensity : it does not relate to the fermi surface , but to the quantum hall effect .",
    "it is equal to the change of wave vector from sub - phase to sub - phase and not to the subphase density wave wavevector .",
    "it is a historical fact that , probably because of the advent of high temperature superconductivity , the experimental and theoretical effort about the uqc has slowed down considerably since 1986 . in particular",
    "no experimental study has been published to test the theory of mr modes in the uqc , most of which dates back to 1987 .",
    "practically no theoretical progress either has been recorded since the first papers in 1987@xcite and 1988@xcite .",
    "another plausible reason for the lack of experimental effort about the uqc collective modes is the lack of theoretical understanding , until recently , of the quantum hall sign inversion phenomenon , the so called ribault anomaly .",
    "the latter was discovered early on@xcite , and was thought by some to be incompatible with the theory of the `` usual '' monotonic quantum hall effect and uqc cascade phase diagram .    as will be discussed further on ,",
    "the ribault anomaly is now believed to be understandable within the same theoretical scheme , the `` quantum nesting model''(qnm ) , that allows to understand a good deal of the uqc phenomenology@xcite . as a result",
    ", the other theoretical predictions of the qnm should be taken seriously and allowed to be tested experimentally in a detailed fashion .",
    "this paper aims at bridging a gap between the theoretical state of affairs on the uqc collective modes , and the need for detailed quantitative predictions which could , and should , be compared to experiments .",
    "for instance , estimates of mr energies relative to the single particle gap , predictions about evolution of collective mode energies with magnetic field , estimates of mr effective mass anisotropy , were non existent until now .",
    "we consider also phases with _ negative _ quantum hall numbers , called `` ribault phases '' , which have a qualitatively different spectrum from sub - phases with _ positive _ ( majority sign ) qhe@xcite . in the negative sign qhe phase",
    ", mr have different ( larger ) _ wave vectors _ , different ( larger ) _ energies _ , and different _ field dependences _ when compared to the mr modes of the majority sign phases .",
    "phases neighbouring the ribault phases , either in parameter space or in energy were predicted to have mr spectra intermediate between those of the normal phases and those of ribault phases .",
    "for the first time detailed numerical estimates of the mr modes ( within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) ) in the ribault phases , and the neighbouring phases are given , based on model parameter values which describe well the bechgaard salts .",
    "in addition , with the particular set of parameters studied here , a new feature , previously unnoticed , emerges : a third mr mode , with lower energy ( in most parts of the phase diagram ) and almost no field dependence is predicted and computed .",
    "furthermore , this study also reveals a large sensitivity of the sign reversal phenomenon to the strength of electron - electron interactions .    in order to compute the collective mode energies of the ordered phases , a first step deals with the computation of the metal - uqc instability line",
    "this has yielded an interesting by - product : we have found that the qnm describes , on some occasions , a rentrance of the metallic phase at fixed temperature , as a function of magnetic field @xmath9 , which is a well established experimental fact@xcite .",
    "this rentrance was thought until now to be out of reach of the qnm .",
    "our paper is organised as follows : section ii summarizes known results on the physics of bechgaard salts under magnetic field . in section",
    "iii we describe the results about the metal - uqc instability line ; we emphasize the sensitivity of the phase diagram to the electron - electron interaction strength , in particular as regards the sign inversion phenomenon .",
    "we also discuss the re - entrant behaviour mentionned above .",
    "a summary of fisdw collective mode theory is given in section iv .",
    "new results on collective modes are described in section v which is divided in two parts : one describes the mr spectrum for the usual monotonic sequence of quantum hall phases , and shows how , as the field intensity is stepped up , uqc phases lose their field independent mr modes , and go over at high fields to a low energy excitation spectrum similar to that of a perfectly nested spin density wave .",
    "the second part of section v gives the corresponding results for `` ribault phases '' ( phases with quantum hall effect sign inversion ) .",
    "we show there that the spectrum of mr modes exhibits qualitatively different features as compared to the monotonic sequence case .",
    "the same subsection also discusses the features of the mr spectrum in phases neighbouring the ribault phase in parameter space .",
    "a summary of the results and a discussion of their meaning is given in the conclusion .",
    "here we recall in more details some aspects of the physics of bechgaard salts , and of their behaviour under magnetic field .",
    "organic conductors of the bechgaard salts family , @xmath10 where @xmath11 = tetramethylselenafulvalene are quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) systems .",
    "the typical hierarchy of their transfer integrals is : @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 . in three members of this family ( @xmath15 ) ,",
    "the metallic phase is destroyed by a moderate magnetic field @xmath9 applied along the @xmath16 direction , perpendicular to the most conducting planes ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "a cascade of magnetic phases , separated by first order transitions appears as the field intensity is stepped up : within each sub - phase , a fisdw is stabilized with a peculiar electronic structure , characterized by a small number of exactly filled landau levels ( bands in fact ) @xcite .",
    "the landau bands are separated by a hierarchy of gaps @xmath18 which oscillate with the magnetic field .",
    "the phase labelled by @xmath19 is characterized by the largest gap @xmath20 at the the fermi level .",
    "a sum rule @xmath21 , connects all the gaps to the order parameter @xmath22 .",
    "each uqc sub - phase exhibits a quantized hall conductivity , which is the first example of a quantum hall effect in a 3d system .",
    "the cascade of quantized phases results from an interplay between the nesting properties of the fermi surface ( fs ) , and the quantization of electronic orbits in the field : the wave vector of the sdw varies with field so that unpaired carriers in a subphase are always organized in completed filled landau bands . as a result",
    "the number of carriers in each subphase is quantized , and so is the hall conductivity : @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the condensation of the uqc phases results from the peculiar electronic structure of open fermi surface metal under magnetic field : because of lorentz force , the electronic motion becomes periodic and confined along the high conductivity direction of the chains ( * a * direction)@xcite .",
    "the periodic orbital motion of the electrons in real space is characterized by a wave vector @xmath24 , @xmath25 being the interchain distance .",
    "the orbital wavelength @xmath26 is such that the flux threading the space between two organic chains over a length @xmath26 is one flux quantum @xmath27 . as a result ,",
    "the static bare susceptibility of the normal phase , @xmath28 can be expressed as a sum over weighted strictly 1d bare susceptibilities which diverge at quantized values of the longitudinal component of the wave vector @xmath29@xcite .",
    "the largest divergence signals the appearance of a sdw phase with quantized vector @xmath30 .",
    "it is important to realize that the periodic electronic motion along the @xmath31 direction is manifest in a particular choice of gauge , the landau gauge , when @xmath32 . with this choice , under the peierls - onsager substitution",
    ", the transverse electronic dispersion relation ( which is periodic in @xmath33 ) , @xmath34 , becomes @xmath35 , i. e. a periodic one - electron potential along @xmath31 . with a different choice of gauge ,",
    "say @xmath36 , the single electron schrdinger equation is completely different , and no periodic potential appears along @xmath31 , although the electronic spectrum is unchanged .",
    "this gauge dependent formulation is familiar for problems of orbital magnetism . in any particular choice of gauge , the potential vector breaks translational symmetry in a particular way , and single electron wave functions are gauge dependent .",
    "energy spectra and macroscopic response functions are gauge independent .    the quantized nesting model ( qnm ) @xcite describes most of the features of the phase diagram in a magnetic field .",
    "it has been shown recently to explain the experimental observation of the hall plateaux sign reversal when the field varies@xcite .",
    "most plateaux exhibit the same sign .",
    "( by convention we will refer to these plateaux as positive ones ) .",
    "the sign reversal has been discovered by ribault in @xmath37 under certain conditions of cooling rate@xcite .",
    "negative plateaux have been reproduced and also found in @xmath38 where their existence depends crucially on pressure @xcite .",
    "recently , balicas et al @xcite have shown that there exists a range of pressure for which , in the @xmath39 salt , the sequence of observed plateaux when the field decreases can be identified with the quantum numbers @xmath40 .",
    "a more ancient experiment has shown a sequence of phases @xmath41@xcite .",
    "hereafter , we will refer to the uqc phase with negative hall number as `` ribault phases '' .",
    "zanchi and montambaux@xcite have shown that the negative plateaux can be understood within the qnm assuming the dispersion relation in the normal phase to be :    @xmath42    @xmath43is a periodic function which describes a warped fs . with @xmath44 , eq.([model ] ) can not lead to sign reversals , as @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "small values of @xmath46k , and @xmath47k , however , are sufficient to account for the experimental results of balicas et al .",
    "( a slightly different explanation for the negative hall effect phases has been put forward recently , based on the consideration of umklapp terms @xcite and a non - zero @xmath48 term .",
    "we will not consider the umklapp terms in this work . )    in eq.([model ] ) , the only parameters which are not determined yet by experiments are @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "those parameters certainly exist as a correction to the linearized form of the dispersion relation along @xmath31 , and they have to be small compared to @xmath51 .",
    "the normal metal - fisdw instability line @xmath52 is given by : @xmath53 @xmath54 is the electronic interaction constant . eq.([ki ] ) exhibits the structure of @xmath55 as the sum of one dimensional terms @xmath56 shifted by the magnetic field wave vector @xmath24 .",

    "eq.([ki ] ) allows to compute the metal - uqc instability line .",
    "we show here that it is not sufficient , to determine the sequence of uqc phases , to examine the maxima of @xmath62 as a function of @xmath63 at different fixed temperatures .",
    "this remark is especially meaningful in the description of the sign inversion phenomenon : depending on the value of @xmath64 in ( [ ki ] ) different sequences of uqc phases emerge .",
    "define @xmath65 as the fisdw ordering temperature in infinite field . in the latter case @xmath66 and @xmath67 . from eq.([ki ] ) , we have @xmath68 .",

    "the upper limit of this family is the actual ( continuous non analytic ) transition line from the normal metal to the uqc ; this line coincides piecewise with the transition lines labelled by the successive integers describing the quantum hall conductivity@xcite .",
    "it is clear from inspection of eq.([tc ] ) that _ @xmath88 does not scale with @xmath65 _ , since the ratio @xmath89 on the left hand side of eq.([tc ] ) depends on @xmath65 through the argument of the logarithms on the right hand side .",
    "the variation of the ratio @xmath89 with @xmath65 is complicated , with no clear tendency emerging at first sight because the coefficients @xmath90 have an oscillating behaviour as a function of their arguments @xmath91 .",

    "detailed experimental determination of the instability line has revealed that @xmath116 may change sign as a function of @xmath9@xcite .",
    "this means that the metallic phase , at a fixed temperature exhibits a re - entrant behaviour as a function of field .",
    "this feature was thought to be outside the reach of the qnm in its usual formulation for the monotonic quantum hall number sequence because , until now the theoretical derivations of the transition lines within the qnm with @xmath44 have not reproduced this feature .",
    "we have first found this behaviour in the numerical simulations with non zero values for @xmath49 and @xmath50 , as shown in fig.([fig:3a ] ) .",
    "we have then studied this phenomenon as a function of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the outcome of this study is that re - entrance appears already within the model with @xmath44 , within the framework of the monotonic sequence of hall numbers , as shown on fig.([fig:3a ] ) and fig.([fig:3b ] ) .",
    "it appears to depend also on the value of @xmath65 .",
    "= 8.6 cm    = 8.6 cm",
    "our conclusion about this aspect of the phase diagram is that there is nothing mysterious about the re - entrant behaviour , which is well within reach of the simplest qnm ; it is a simple consequence of the general shape of the @xmath117 curves as function of field : each in turn goes through a maximum then decreases with field .",
    "if for a given @xmath19 the maximum as a function of field is also the absolute maximum for all @xmath19 values and for the same field , re - entrant behaviour follows .",
    "we now turn to the collective modes of the uqc which depend directly on the network of real and virtual transition lines defined in the last section . using this network for the monotonic quantum hall sequence , ( @xmath44 ) , lederer and poilblanc showed that the uqc collective modes exhibit , aside from the usual goldstone modes linear in wave vector , at least one magneto - roton ( hereafter mr ) mode within the single particle gap , located at @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and some optimum @xmath120@xcite . only the mode at @xmath121",
    "was actually proved to exist . together with the usual goldstone modes , it is the signature of the novel nature of the electron - hole condensate in uqc : a spin density wave driven by orbital quantization and an integer quantum hall system driven by electronic interactions .",
    "the mr mode is both a consequence of quasi 1d electronic periodic orbital motion , gauge invariance , and the long range crystalline order of the field induced phase@xcite .",
    "the physical mechanism behind the mr minimum may be described as follows : the goldstone boson at wave vector @xmath122 , in a usual sdw phase , is an overdamped mode , because @xmath123 , which is much larger than the single particle gap , at any value @xmath124@xcite . however",
    ", a fluctuation mode , in phase @xmath19 , at a wave vector @xmath125 can scatter against the self consistent periodic orbital potential ( responsible for the gaps at @xmath126 in the single particle dispersion relation ) and shift its parallel momentum by @xmath127 , so as to propagate as a virtual mode with @xmath128 , i. e. a zero energy mode ! however , it is not really a zero energy mode , as it would if the periodic orbital potential was a bona fide electrostatic potential , with bona - fide bragg reflections .",
    "in fact this virtual shift in wave vector allows the mode at @xmath122 to propagate in a medium which is not exactly like phase @xmath19 for @xmath128 , but which is a mixture of unstable ( excited ) phases @xmath129 .",
    "as we shall see , the closer the free energies of phases @xmath129 to that of phase @xmath19 , the lower the mr energy within the single particle gap .    on the other hand ,",
    "once the quantum hall sign inversion phenomenon is explained within the qnm , at the cost of refining the description of the electronic dispersion relation , the collective mode theory derived for the monotonic uqc sequence applies directly to the `` ribault phase '' , the phase with inverted quantum hall sign@xcite .",
    "this has a surprising consequence : exploiting the topology of the phase diagram in the presence of hall effect sign changes , one shows that the mr spectrum for the ribault phase @xmath130 should be qualitatively different from the usual spectrum in the monotonic sequence case , so that the ribault phases are physically distinct from the majority sign uqc phases , and not just the same objects with negative carriers sign . for the particular sequence observed by balicas et al.@xcite ,",
    "i.e. 1 , 2 , -2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , the differences in the -2 phase as opposed to the usual uqc subphase are the following :    * there are no mr modes with energy minimum at @xmath121 or at @xmath131 * there are at two mr modes with energy minimum at @xmath132 and @xmath133 * these mr modes have substantially higher energies than their usual counterparts . in particular , within the rpa , their energies are larger than half the single particle gap * both energy minima have a much larger field dependence than their normal counterparts * those field dependences have opposite signs : the mode at @xmath132 is a decreasing function of the magnetic field , while the mode at @xmath133 is an increasing function of the magnetic field    likewise , the mr spectrum of uqc phase @xmath19 ( @xmath134 ) neighbouring the ribault phase @xmath135 are `` contaminated '' by their neighbour , with one usual mr mode at @xmath121 and one mode at larger wave vector @xmath136 , with large magnetic field dependence .",
    "this behaviour will be understood qualitatively from the equation for the mode energies in the following subsections ; as for the modes within the ribault phase , it is due to the dissymetry between virtual phase energies for phases @xmath137 since @xmath138 and @xmath139 have opposite signs .",

    "it is then straightforward to show from eq.([tm ] ) that @xmath201 . in most other cases , a numerical solution of eq.([tm ] ) proves necessary .",
    "the following section presents the results of our detailed numerical analysis .",
    "we now exploit the results of the last section .",
    "first we derived , at @xmath202 , the mr mode spectrum in a generic case : a phase well within a monotonic sequence of uqc phases .",
    "we picked phase @xmath203 .",
    "then we study the differences which arise at high field , for the last two phases of the monotonic sequence : @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "the parameters we took for the numerical estimates are relevant to the bechgaard salts , and have been used previously in the literature@xcite : @xmath12 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 , @xmath96 .",
    "( those parameters may change with pressure , notably @xmath93 ) .",
    "the results are shown on fig.([fig : mr2 ] ) .",
    "we find two modes , at @xmath3 or @xmath4 which vary little with @xmath9 , and a _ third mode _ , rather close to the upper edge of the gap , at * @xmath208*. this mode is yet another example of `` contamination '' by the ribault phase @xmath209 discussed in the next subsection @xcite .",
    "it has a monotonic @xmath9 negative variation , and drowns into the single particle continuum for @xmath210 t .",
    "= 8.6 cm    we have looked for mr mode with @xmath211 , in phase @xmath113 , which might arise from contamination of the near - by ribault phase @xmath212 , and found it did not exist in the absence of additional terms in eq.([model ] ) , but this mode will certainly become alive under pressure@xcite .    the rpa evaluation yields a mr minimum @xmath213 , located at @xmath214 for @xmath215 . by varying @xmath76 around @xmath216 at fixed @xmath217 , we can compute the transverse mr mode dispersion .",
    "we find a _ very large _ mass anisotropy @xmath218 , with @xmath219 .",
    "the fact that @xmath220 makes this mr mode a good candidate for the kind of specific heat anomalies discussed in ref(@xcite ) . the mass anisotropy is larger for the mode @xmath221 , we find @xmath222 @xmath223.see fig.([fig : mr3 ] ) .",
    "the mr energy @xmath224 is discontinuous at the transition from @xmath19 to @xmath141 .",
    "this contributes a ( small ) term , which corrects the mean field estimate to the transition latent heat . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath225 goes continuously at the transition to @xmath226 into @xmath227 ( i. e. a _ distinct _ mr with the _ same _ energy ) .",
    "the computed mr dispersion relation is shown on fig.([fig : mr3 ] ) .",
    "= 8.6 cm      the situation changes for @xmath228 t , the critical value for the transition from uqc phases @xmath229 to @xmath230 .",
    "the reason for this change is apparent from the @xmath231 curve in fig.([fig : mr1 ] ) : in phase 1 , the mode at @xmath3 continues to mix two virtual phases with free energies close to the the free energy of phase 1 , i.e. phases 0 and 2 .",
    "but the mode at @xmath221 mixes two virtual phases with widely different free energies : phase 0 ( with free energy close to that of phase 1 ) and phase -1 which has a very low ( virtual ) ordering temperature @xmath232 .",
    "similarly , in phase @xmath205 , both modes at @xmath233 and @xmath4 mix a low energy phase ( resp . @xmath204 and @xmath234 ) with high energy ones ( resp . @xmath235 and @xmath209 ) . as the free energy difference between phase @xmath205 and phase @xmath236 increases rapidly as the field increases",

    "the high energy mode , with @xmath221 increases its energy monotonically with field , at a rate @xmath237 , then merges into the single particle continuum for @xmath238 t. then only one mr at @xmath3 survives , at lower energy , and with a non monotonic field dependence . in fact",
    "the rate of variation of @xmath239 is also large , @xmath240 for @xmath241 t. for @xmath242 t , @xmath243 .    at the transition from @xmath204 to @xmath205 , at @xmath244 t",
    ", two mr modes appear discontinuously .",
    "the mr at @xmath3 is @xmath245 higher in energy in phase @xmath246 , and that at @xmath221 is close to the single particle continuum , at @xmath247 .",
    "in fact this latter mode is also connected to the `` contamination '' of the ribault phase at @xmath209 , since it connects @xmath248 and @xmath249 as described by eq.([tc])@xcite .",
    "both mr energies increase rapidly with @xmath9 , at a rate @xmath250 for the low energy mode , @xmath251 for the high energy one .",
    "= 8.6 cm     the last surviving mr dissolves into the single particle continuum for @xmath252 t. for larger @xmath9 the only collective modes left are the usual goldstone modes at @xmath253 .",
    "then the only specific features of the uqc left are small single particle energy gaps , at most an order of magnitude smaller than the fs gap , at large energies @xmath254 , etc ..",
    "= 8.6 cm     the low energy physics of the @xmath205 phase for @xmath252 t is thus identically that of an insulating sdw phase with perfect nesting fs .",
    "the actual field values for which the mr mode drowns in the continuum in phase @xmath205 can not be taken too seriously , since for that range of field values , the approximation @xmath255 breaks down completely .",
    "however , the behaviour found above holds qualitatively since the approximation becomes good again at higher fields .    in this section , besides proving that within the rpa , more than one mr mode is usually alive in the single particle gap , at @xmath3 or @xmath4 ( possibly @xmath256 , or @xmath257 etc . due to the vicinity of ribault phases , as we shall see in the next section ) and computing their energies as a function of field , we have derived for the first time numerical estimates of the very large effective mass anisotropy of the mr .",
    "we have described how , as the magnetic field increases , uqc phases at small quantum numbers progressively lose their mr and , above a threshhold field , retrieve a low energy excitation spectrum of a conventional sdw with perfect nesting . in the following ,",
    "we examine how the situation changes in the case of the ribault phase .",
    "we now turn to the quantum hall sign inversion phenomenon . specifically , we are interested in the following quantum hall number sequence : ...",
    "6,5,4,-2,2,1 , which corresponds to the uqc cascade shown on fig.([fig:1a])(notice that no phase @xmath226 is thermodynamically stable in fig.([fig:1a ] ) ) . investigating the mr spectrum of phase @xmath209 , we now have , from eq.([rot2 ] ) , the following possibilities :    * both @xmath138 and @xmath139 are @xmath258",
    ". then @xmath259 are so small that no mr mode can exist within the single particle gap .",
    "this preclude mr modes to exist for @xmath197 or @xmath260 . * or @xmath261 .",
    "then one of the virtual transition lines , say @xmath262 may be close to @xmath263 , but the other one is very close to zero .",
    "then a mr mode may exist around @xmath264 , with relative energy @xmath265 .    as a consequence , the mr spectrum in the ribault phase @xmath209 exhibits the following qualitative features @xcite",
    ": there are no modes at @xmath121 , or @xmath4 but two higher energy modes exist at @xmath132 and @xmath266 ; they have large magnetic field dependences of opposite sign ; the two modes cross roughly in the center of phase @xmath130 in the phase diagram .",
    "in addition , we find a third , almost field independent mr at @xmath133 which was not described in ref.(@xcite ) . in this latter work ,",
    "hall sign inversion was studied among a complete sequence of integers , as opposed to the sequence where one , or more than one , integer is missing , such as the sequence discussed here : @xmath267 . in the latter case",
    "the mode @xmath133 is due to the existence of a virtual phase at @xmath268 the free energy of which is only slightly above that of phase @xmath130 : the two corresponding lines are practically parallel within the whole @xmath209 phase , while the `` associate '' phase at @xmath269 has very large free energy .",
    "i. e. very small values of @xmath270 .",
    "this is another case of contamination from a nearly stable phase . as discussed above ,",
    "the corresponding mr mode is then field independent , and its value relative to the single particle gap of phase @xmath130 is close to @xmath271 . see fig.([fig : ri3a ] ) .",
    "= 8.6 cm    another feature apparent in fig.([fig : ri3a ] ) is the qualitatively different behaviour of modes at @xmath1 and @xmath272 ( resp @xmath273 ) as a function of magnetic field in phase @xmath234 ( resp @xmath203 ) .",
    "the reason for this difference in behaviour is that the mode at @xmath1 couples two virtual phases with low free energies ( e.g. phases 1 and 3 for the mode at @xmath1 in phase 2 ) ; the latter vary with opposite sign as a function of magnetic field . on the other hand the mode at @xmath272 in phase 2 couples two phases with very different free energies : low energy phase -2 and high energy phase 6 . then according to eq.([tm ] )",
    ", the low free energy virtual phase dictates its field dependence to the mr mode .",
    "it is obvious that even richer mr spectra are expected when the fisdw phase diagram has more sign reversals .",
    "the closer those sign reversed phases in parameter space , the more complex the mr spectrum : this is because there are more virtual uqc phases with free energies close to that of the stable one .",
    "see for example the network of virtual transition lines within phase @xmath212 in fig.([-4 ] ) .",
    "= 8.6 cm    this network of virtual transition lines gives rise to the mr spectrum shown in fig.([ri3b ] ) .",
    "in view of the renewed confidence in the quantum nesting model as a valid description of the field induced spin density wave phenomenon in bechgaard salts , we have developped the theoretical consequences of the model as regards the collective modes of the uqc .      *",
    "we give detailed numerical predictions regarding the collective mode spectrum when the phase diagram has no fisdw with negative quantum hall number ( monotonic quantum hall sequence ) . in that case",
    "we have proved numerically the existence , within the rpa , of a second mr mode with @xmath221 within the single particle energy gap , in the generic case .",
    "both low energy modes at @xmath1 and @xmath4 are almost field independent in the whole domain of stability of a given phase .",
    "in addition , a strongly field dependent mode at larger parallel wave vector may propagate within the single particle gap because of `` contamination '' from a virtual phase with negative quantum hall number , when the latter is almost stable .",
    "the mass anisotropy of the mr modes are computed for the first time .",
    "the parallel to in - plane transverse mass ratio is of order @xmath274 .",
    "+ then we have studied the mr spectrum of phases with quantum numbers 1 and 0 , i.e. phases at large field ( typically @xmath275 ) .",
    "we show that the two low energy modes become field dependent , their energies increase with field and , in the case of the @xmath205 phase , they merge in the single particle excitation continuum . above a threshold field which we have computed",
    ", the low energy physics of the fisdw is that of a perfectly nested sdw phase .",
    "* we have turned to the case of the uqc phase cascade with quantum hall sign inversion .",
    "this unique phenomenon of the quantum hall effect physics , observed only in the bechgaard salts , leads to a different structure in the collective mode mr spectra of the sign reversed phases .",
    "there are no modes with @xmath3 or @xmath4 ; there are modes centered at larger wave vectors , with larger energies , and with different field dependences ; in the case of cascades with various sign reversals , there might be four , or more , modes in the single particle gap with wave vectors an order of magnitude larger than in the monotonic cascade case .",
    "+ in the course of this latter study , which involves two poorly known small parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 which correct the normal metal electronic dispersion relation , we have shown that the cascade phase diagram , besides depending sensitively on @xmath49 and @xmath50@xcite depends also sensitively on the electron - electron interaction parameter @xmath65 : a change of this parameter by a factor 3 may suppress altogether the sign inversion phenomenon .",
    "the metal / uqc instability line does not scale with @xmath65 .",
    "+ we have also found that the model contains the ( experimentally observed ) possibility of metallic re - entrance at fixed temperature as a function of field ; this may happen also when @xmath44 .",
    "our results are obtained within the rpa , in the `` very weak '' coupling limit ( @xmath276 ) . in bechgaard salts ,",
    "this ratio is of order .4 below 6 t , and increases with field . between 8 t and 20 t",
    ", it is actually larger than 1 , then it decreases and becomes small at very large fields .",
    "thus , significant corrections may be expected , in a weak coupling rpa , ( i. e. @xmath277 ) to all estimates derived here , in particular between 8 t and 20 t. we have found that the lowest mr energy minima of the positive uqc phases could be sometimes below @xmath20 .",
    "those values might be significantly lowered by self - trapping effects , which are outside the scope of linear response theory .",
    "however the presence of mr with @xmath278 does not seem to be garanteed for all @xmath19 .",
    "the effective masses should increase due to mr - mr scattering processes , etc .. the importance of those effects will be gauged by comparing experimental values to the estimates given here .",
    "the latter should be a useful guideline to determine the mr parameters .",
    "we have provided a number of new quantitative and qualitative predictions on the spectrum of fisdw collective modes , derived from the qnm model which should help experimentalists in the detection of these original fluctuation modes of an original electron - hole condensate .    for recent reviews ,",
