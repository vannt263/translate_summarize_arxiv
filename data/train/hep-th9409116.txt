    "physical systems in actual situation are so complicated that even in a simplified form there usually need some approximation techniques , such as perturbation of the coupling constant or the self - consistent manner of hartree - fock . in path",
    "integral the most promising one seems to be a semiclassical ( wkb ) approximation .",
    "however there are some systems in which the wkb approximation gives the exact result : a harmonic oscillator is the well - known example ( and may be the only case if we are in a usual quantum mechanical circumstance , that is , on a flat and non - compact manifold ) ; since the hamiltonian is quadratic in momenta and coordinates , yielding a gaussian form in the path integral .",
    "if generalization is made to quantum mechanics on a non - trivial manifold such as @xmath0 spin system@xcite@xcite@xcite or @xmath7 system , a new possibility may occur @xcite : this new possibility of exactness of the wkb approximation is discussed in connection with the theorem of duistermaat - heckman(d - h ) @xcite and is extended to grassmannian manifold @xcite .",
    "so far the discussion has been concentrated mainly on the geometrical view point @xcite .",
    "however there are a number of unsatisfactory points and mysteries : the ingredient for obtaining path integral formulae is ( apart from @xcite,@xcite , and @xcite ) so called ( generalized ) coherent states . they have employed naive calculus , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is some generalized coherent states and the elements @xmath10 and @xmath11 are assumed to @xmath12 with @xmath13 ; which , however , can not be justified because @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the integration variables in the path integral . thus obtained  quantum \" action in the path integral formula has already been in a semiclassical state .",
    "the reason why this kind of rough estimation could have been accepted is that the resultant action is beautifully geometric . in this sense , it is still unsatisfactory for us that ad hoc adoption of geometrical actions in path integral even if those would give us a correct result .",
    "another issue in our mind is that we should be so careful in performing wkb approximation : first point is so called overspecification problem .",
    "it is often said that the wkb approximation is not allowed in the case of kernel under the ( canonical ) coherent state representation ; @xmath14 @xmath15 giving @xmath16 } \\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\mathop{\\hphantom{\\lim _ { n \\rightarrow \\infty } \\prod_{j=1}^{n-1 } } } \\left(\\hbox{with } { z_0=z_i , \\ z_n = z_f}\\right ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have successively inserted the resolution of unity ( [ intrc ] ) into the product in third expression of the first line .",
    "the wkb - approximation is performed by putting @xmath17 , where @xmath18 s satisfy the classical _ continuum _ equations of motion , @xmath19 ; since @xmath18 s are not the integration variables so that the continuum limit can be taken safely .",
    "however there are _ two _ boundary conditions ; @xmath20 despite the fact that the equations of motion are first order differential equations @xcite . ) , wkb approximation is nothing but a saddle point approximation for @xmath21 integration variables . for this case",
    "we have a set of @xmath22 equations @xmath23 they should be solved with conditions @xmath24 for the first equation and @xmath25 for the second one respectively .",
    "thus we see there is no such problem if we work with the discrete time formulation of path integral . ] for the trace formula , @xmath26 the boundary condition becomes a periodic one ; @xmath27(pbc ) , which has of course no problem .",
    "case is unchanged for the generalized coherent state representation ; however , seems a little bit drastic in @xmath0 of nielsen - rohrlich formula @xcite,@xcite,@xcite : the boundary condition is @xmath28 but the equation of motion reads @xmath29 they are never compatible .",
    "( see the discussion . )",
    "the second point that we would like to mention is subtlety of the use of continuum path integral under the coherent representation : as an example , take the harmonic oscillator , @xmath30 , in ( [ intre ] ) and go to the naive continuum limit , giving @xmath31 where the determinant has been defined as , @xmath32 , with @xmath33 coming from a periodic eigenfunction ; @xmath34 , and use has been made of the @xmath35-function regularization .",
    "the correct answer is @xmath36 of course .",
    "this discrepancy when being in the continuum expression is always left in other cases such as @xmath0 and might be in the chern - simons field theory as a need for the coxeter number @xcite(see the discussion ) .",
    "motivated by these , we shall in this paper study the exactness of the wkb approximation under the path integral formula in the case of @xmath0 and @xmath37 with the aid of generalized coherent states . to avoid the above questionable issues , we shall concentrate only on formulae like ( [ intre ] ) . in section 2",
    ", we shall introduce the path integral expression for the character formulae of @xmath0 and @xmath37 and study their structure . the following section 3 deals with the exactness of the wkb approximation .",
    "the final section will be devoted to discussions and in the appendix , geometrical properties of generalized coherent states and the relationship to the canonical coherent states will be presented , which will be useful for an analysis of @xmath7 as well as grassmannian manifold .",

    "<S> using the generalized coherent states we argue that the path integral formulae for @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( in the discrete series ) are wkb exact , if the starting point is expressed as the trace of @xmath2 with @xmath3 being given by a linear combination of generators . in our case , wkb approximation is achieved by taking a large `` spin '' limit : @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the result is obtained directly by knowing that the each coefficient vanishes under the @xmath5(@xmath6 ) expansion and is examined by another method to be legitimated . </S>",
    "<S> we also point out that the discretized form of path integral is indispensable , in other words , the continuum path integral expression leads us to a wrong result . </S>",
    "<S> therefore a great care must be taken when some geometrical action would be adopted , even if it is so beautiful , as the starting ingredient of path integral . </S>"
