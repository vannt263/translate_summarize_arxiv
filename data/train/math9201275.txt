    "the purpose of this article is to analyse complex singularities in temperature of the free energy @xmath1 in the ising model on diamond  like hierarchical lattices . according to the traditional point of view",
    "a phase transition manifests itself as a singularity of @xmath1 as a function of thermodynamic parameters ( like temperature and external magnetic field ) . from this point of view",
    "the theory of phase transitions should describe the domain of analyticity of @xmath1 and the type of its singularities at points of phase transition ( see [ 1 ] , where diverse approaches to the first of these problems are discussed ) .",
    "since @xmath1 is real analytic outside of points of phase transition , it can be continued into complex space with respect to the thermodynamic parameters .",
    "description of its complex singularities is of great interest for the theory of phase transitions because it determines analytic properties of the thermodynamic function .",
    "the celebrated lee  yang theory ( see [ 2 ] ) gives a realisation of this approach describing the singularities of the analytic continuation of the free energy in the ferromagnetic ising model with respect to the external magnetic field .",
    "it proves that the zeroes of the grand partition function in the ferromagnetic ising model lie on the imaginary axis , and hence complex singularities of the free energy lie on the imaginary axis as well .",
    "an important problem stated in [ 2 ] is to study the limit distribution of zeros of the grand partition function , since the free energy can be expressed as a logarithmic potential over this distribution .",
    "the problem of description of complex singularities of the analytic continuation of thermodynamic functions in temperature is also very interesting from different points of view .",
    "many properties of asymptotic behavior of thermodynamic functions in vicinity of a critical point were investigated through the kadanoff  wilson  fisher renormalisation group theory ( see e.g. [ 3,4 ] ) .",
    "it gives a local form of real critical singularities of thermodynamic functions which has a nice universal scaling structure .",
    "a problem is how are these singularities continued to complex space and what is their global structure in complex space ?",
    "unfortunately no general theory like the lee ",
    "yang theory exists which describes for general models global complex singularities of thermodynamic functions in complex temperature plane .",
    "however some exact results were obtained for the two dimensional ising model .",
    "the main tool here is the famous onsager solution .",
    "it turns out that in isotropic two dimensional ising model the zeroes of the partition function lie asymptotically on two circles @xmath2 ( it was conjectured by fisher [ 5 ] and proved in [ 6 ] ) .",
    "later it was shown ( see [ 7,8 ] and references there ) that in anisotropic two dimensional ising models on diverse lattices the zeroes of the partition function fill some planar regions in the complex temperature plane and in some cases the density of the limit distribution of zeroes can be found explicitly .    in the present paper",
    "we consider another exactly solvable model , namely the ising model on diamond - like hierarchical lattices ( see [ 9 - 11 ] ) . in this case the migdal ",
    "kadanoff renormalization transformation turns out to be to a rational map @xmath0 on the riemann sphere which can be found explicitly .",
    "the following nice observation was made in papers [ 12 , 13 ] : the set of complex points of phase transition coincides with the julia set of this map . in this paper",
    "we study the analytical properties of the free energy f near the singular points .",
    "we believe that clear understanding of analytical properties of thermodynamical functions in the complex plane has much to do with physical nature of the model .",
    "the hierarchical sequence of the diamond - like lattices depends on one natural parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the lattice @xmath4 is just two `` outer '' sites related by a bond . in order to obtain @xmath5",
    "we insert in between the outer sites @xmath6 inner sites related by bonds with outer ones ( see fig . 0 for @xmath7 ) . then in order to obtain @xmath8 we replace each bond in @xmath9 by the lattice @xmath5 , @xmath10 .",
    "figure 0    we will refer to papers [ 11 - 15 ] for the description of the ising model on these lattices and the calculation of the thermodynamical functions .",
    "the starting point for us is the following explicit formula for the free energy :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the  dimension \" of the lattice , @xmath14 is the interaction constant , @xmath15 is temperature , and the sequence @xmath16 , is given by the following recurrent equation    @xmath17    where @xmath18 with the initial data @xmath19    equations ( 1.2)-(1.4 ) mean from the physical point of view that the map @xmath20 gives the rescaling of temperature under the migdal - kadanoff renorm - group transformation ( see [ 9 - 15 ] ) . note that the points @xmath21 and @xmath22 are superstable fixed points of the map @xmath23 ( low- and high - temperature fixed points of the renorm - group ) and for @xmath24 there exists the unique unstable fixed point @xmath25 on [ 0,1 ] .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath26 is equal to @xmath27 .",
    "formulas ( 1.1)-(1.4 ) make sense for complex values of @xmath15 as well .",
    "so , we can consider the analytical continuation of free energy @xmath28 from the positive axis @xmath29 into the complex plane .",
    "it is not hard to see that the singularities of @xmath30 lie on the julia set @xmath31 [ 12 , 13 ] ( for the definition of the latter , see one of the surveys [ 7 - 10 ] ) .",
    "let us consider now the immediate attracting basins @xmath32 and @xmath33 of points 0 and 1 .",
    "one can show that @xmath34 is the union of preimages of these domains , and @xmath32 is a jordan domain in @xmath31 ( see  2).in this paper we study the boundary properties of @xmath30 in the domain @xmath32 . to this end",
    "let us consider the riemann map @xmath35 of @xmath32 onto the unit disk .",
    "the hyperbolic geodesics in @xmath32 are just the @xmath36- images of the radii in @xmath37 .",
    "denote by @xmath38 the geodesic ending at @xmath39 .",
    "let us consider also the harmonic measure @xmath40 on @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the lebesgue measure on the circle @xmath44 . for @xmath45 denote by @xmath46 the length of @xmath47 from @xmath48 to @xmath49 ( perhaps , @xmath50 ) .",
    "in the present paper we prove :    \\(i ) the derivative @xmath51 of free energy is continuous up to the boundary of @xmath32 .",
    "\\(ii ) for @xmath52 the second derivative is discontinuous in @xmath53 , and has the following asymptotics on @xmath40-almost all geodesics :",
    "@xmath54    this means that for almost all geodesics the specific heat critical exponent in the region of low temperatures is universal and equal to @xmath55 .",
    "now let us dwell in more detail on the content of the paper .    in  2",
    "we describe the dynamical properties of the endomorphism @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we show using the douady - hubbard straightening theorem that @xmath32 is a jordan domain .    in  3",
    "we show that @xmath56 is continuous in @xmath57 and that @xmath41 is the natural boundary of analyticity of @xmath1 . the proof is based upon some amusing observations concerning @xmath0 ( its relation to the koebe function and a tchebyshev polynomial ) .",
    "in  4 we discuss some technical background : the bowen - ruelle - sinai thermodynamical formalism and the construction of the natural extension ( the inverse limit ) of @xmath0 .",
    "these are the main tools ( together with the ergodic theorem ) for the accurate computation of the critical exponent .    in  5",
    "we discuss the functional equation for @xmath58 and related spectral properties of the weighted substitution operator in the disk - algebra .",
    " 6 is the central section of the paper : here we give the computation of the critical exponent , provided @xmath58 is not continuous up to the boundary of @xmath32 .    in  7",
    "we prove that @xmath58 really satisfies this property , which completes the proof of the main result .    in the last",
    " 8 we discuss some related problems .    * acknowledgement .",
    "* we are grateful to j. milnor for looking through the text and making useful remarks , to m. fisher and the referee for critical comments yielding the improvement of the exposition , to j. milnor and g. tusnagy for making nice computer pictures , and to nefim fund of hungarian academy of sciences for the support of the visit of one of the authors ( p.m.b . ) to budapest .",
    "we refer to the surveys [ 16 - 19 ] for the general view of the dynamics of complex rational maps .",

    "the power functions and tchebyshev polynomials play a particular role in the iteration theory .",
