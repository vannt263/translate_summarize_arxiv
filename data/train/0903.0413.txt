    "in the standard flat , gaussian , adiabatic , and scale - invariant @xmath2cdmparadigm @xmath3 % of the matter density of the universe is in the form of dark matter ( dm ) @xcite .",
    "the properties of dark matter are largely unconstrained , although a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) with a mass @xmath4 gev  1 tev has many attractive features , including that it leads to a relic density of dark matter that is remarkably close to the measured value @xcite .",
    "no interaction of dark matter either with itself or with standard model ( sm ) particles other than gravity has ever been observed .",
    "however , at the present day we can not exclude that the dark sector is brimming with a rich phenomenology at weak - interaction scales or lower .",
    "one exciting possibility is that dark matter self - annihilates at a level observable in the galactic halo today . detecting this self - annihilation seems unlikely considering the standard self - annihilation cross section ; @xmath5 @xmath6 s@xmath7 for consistency with the observed relic density .",
    "however , there are various mechanisms to boost the annihilation signal to a value larger by a few orders of magnitude , e.g. , clumpiness of the dark halo or a combination of coannihilations and sommerfeld enhancement @xcite .",
    "the possibility of detecting the dm  annihilation signal has attracted much attention recently because of the anomalous excesses of high energy electrons and positrons reported by two different experimental groups : the payload for antimatter exploration and light - nuclei astrophysics ( pamela ) satellite , which saw a sharp upturn in the positron fraction @xmath8 from 10 to 100 gev @xcite , and the advanced thin ionization calorimeter ( atic ) group , which reported an excess over the expected background in the combined number of electrons and positrons at energies 500 to 800 gev @xcite .",
    "the pamela result on the positron fraction confirms earlier results @xcite and can be explained by dm  annihilation @xcite .",
    "there is still a good chance that these anomalies can be obviated by conventional astrophysical effects , e.g. , pulsars .",
    "nevertheless , a plethora of models has been proposed in the last few months explaining the pamela and atic results in terms of dm  annihilation into electron - positron pairs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , a description that also naturally accounts for other experimental anomalies , such as the `` wmap haze '' @xcite , egret observations of an excess of high - energy gamma - rays in the galactic center @xcite , and recent hess measurements of the flux of very high - energy electrons @xcite .",
    "model building is complicated by the fact that pamela did not observe a similar excess in the ratio of anti - protons to protons @xcite , which means that the coupling of the dmparticles to quarks must somehow be suppressed .",
    "the largest obstacle to modeling the pamela / atic signal with dmannihilation is the very large boost factor ( @xmath9 to @xmath0 ) with respect to the fiducial @xmath10 @xmath6 s@xmath7 required to produce an observable annihilation flux .",
    "the boost factor from the clumpiness of the dark matter halo is expected to be small , typically of the order 1 to 10 .",
    "therefore , a different mechanism must be responsible for the large boosts necessary .",
    "one such mechanism that has received much attention lately is the sommerfeld enhancement @xcite .",
    "the sommerfeld enhancement is a generic effect present whenever there is an attractive force acting between the dark matter particles , e.g. , a yukawa interaction or a gauge interaction through vector bosons @xcite .",
    "the main effect of this attractive force is to enhance the annihilation cross section @xmath11 with a factor proportional to @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) ; this is known as `` @xmath14 '' enhancement .",
    "there are regions in the parameter space made up of the dark matter mass @xmath15 , the force carrier mass @xmath16 , and the force `` fine - structure constant '' @xmath17 coupling@xmath18/@xmath19 in which the enhancement is near a resonance , where it approximately behaves as @xmath20 . however , the enhancement saturates at a certain @xmath21 because of the finite range of the attractive force  large ( @xmath22 to @xmath23 ) attractive forces with infinite range lead to a burst of dm  annihilation in the first dm  halos formed at @xmath24 @xmath25 100  200 which would lead to observable effects incompatible with measurements of the diffuse extragalactic gamma - ray background today and the cosmic microwave background @xcite",
    ". since the typical velocities of dark matter particles in the galactic halo today are of the order of the velocity dispersion of the halo , which is non - relativistic ( @xmath26 ) , the cross section of dark matter particles annihilating in the halo could be significantly enhanced by this sommerfeld effect .    both observations @xcite as well as numerical simulations",
    "@xcite have firmly established that dark matter halos in cdm  are not smooth structures , but that they are filled with a large amount of substructure .",
    "these substructures are both in the form of subhalos , self - bound objects orbiting in the galactic halo , and in the form of streams , relics of tidally disrupted subhalos .",
    "since these substructures are overdense regions in the halo , the dark matter annihilation cross section will be correspondingly higher : annihilation cross sections scale as the density squared .",
    "the effects of these kinds of substructure boosts have been studied extensively during the last decade",
    ". however , these subhalos are not only denser than the galactic halo in which they orbit , they are also kinematically colder than the galactic halo , with velocity dispersions that are typically two orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "this means that the sommerfeld enhancement in these subhalos can be many orders of magnitude larger than the sommerfeld enhancement acting in the galactic halo taken as a whole .",
    "in addition to this larger boost caused by the small velocity dispersion in the subhalos , these subhalos themselves are filled with an abundance of substructure which is approximately self - similar to that of the main halo .",
    "each of these even smaller substructure has a larger density than the subhalo in which they are orbiting ( quantified by the well established concentration - mass relationships for cdmhalos @xcite ) as well as a smaller velocity dispersion .",
    "this opens up the possibility that the dark matter annihilation signal in these already cold subhalos can be boosted even further by contribution of their substructure .    in this paper",
    "we quantify the magnitude of this new substructure boost and discuss its implications for the detection of dark matter annihilation from subhalos in the galactic halos .",
    "as we will show , the total combined boost from sommerfeld enhancement and substructure can reach very large values ( 10@xmath27 to 10@xmath28 ) , and these boosts are only weakly dependent on the assumptions that we have to make about the abundance of substructure and the dm  density profile .",
    "we use these total boosts together with published dm  density profiles of some of the dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies of the milky way to predict the total flux of gamma - rays from dm  annihilation that would be detectable by the fermi gamma - ray space telescope ( _ fermi _ ) and find that in most of the models that posit the sommerfeld enhancement the dm  annihilation signal from the dwarf spheroidals shines above the diffuse extragalactic gamma - ray background , which is the only background signal at the high galactic latitudes of these satellite galaxies . finally , we also consider the prospects for detecting smaller subhalos of the galaxy by computing annihilation fluxes of subhalos in the via lactea  ii simulation . whether these subhalos will be detectable in the near future depends on the exact details of the sommerfeld enhancement .",
    "the simplest example of the sommerfeld effect that contains all of the generic features described in the introduction is that from an attractive yukawa type force mediated by a spin-0 boson @xmath29 between the dm  particles , and we adopt that description here .",
    "the sommerfeld effect is a non - perturbative effect in the sense that in the language of quantum field theory it comes about from feynman diagrams in which the force carrier is exchanged many times before the annihilation actually happens , giving rise to so called `` ladder diagrams '' .",
    "however , we can study the sommerfeld effect in simple , non - relativistic quantum mechanics ( see the appendix in ref .",
    "we are instructed to solve the radial schrdinger equation ( in natural units ) @xmath30 subject to the boundary condition @xmath31 as @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 are the mass of the dark matter and the force carrier , respectively .",
    "using the substitution @xmath35 this becomes @xmath36 with boundary condition @xmath37 the sommerfeld enhancement @xmath38  is then given by @xmath39 equation  ( [ eq : sommdiff2 ] ) shows that the sommerfeld enhancement is only a function of two variables , which can be chosen as @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the qualitative features of equation  ( [ eq : sommdiff2 ] ) have been widely discussed and , therefore , we will merely mention them here without proof ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "when the kinetic energy of the collision is much larger than the product of the force carrier mass and the coupling , then the yukawa interaction can be approximated as an attractive coulomb interaction , for which an analytical solution in terms of hypergeometric functions exists .",
    "the sommerfeld enhancement is simply given by @xmath42 from this we see why the sommerfeld enhancement is often referred to as a `` @xmath14 '' enhancement for small velocities @xmath43 . in the limit of a vanishing interaction ( @xmath44 ) the sommerfeld enhancement disappears as @xmath45 . the @xmath14 behavior , which diverges for small @xmath21 and leads to an overproduction of high - energy photons in the early universe @xcite , saturates as a consequence of the finite range of the yukawa interaction at a velocity @xmath46 and settles on a value @xmath47 .",
    "however , at some parameter combinations the yukawa potential has bound states , at which there are large boosts to the annihilation cross section which go approximately as @xmath48 .",
    "these resonance regions , however , are cut - off at small @xmath21 by the finite lifetime of the bound state .",
    "we expect these three different behaviors ( @xmath14 , saturation at low @xmath49 , and resonance effects from the existence of bound states ) to be generic among different models of the sommerfeld enhancement ( see also the discussion in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    .",
    "because of the scaling properties of equation([eq : sommdiff2 ] ) the behavior of the sommerfeld enhancement as a function of @xmath50 can actually be read off along diagonals in the plane.,title=\"fig : \" ] + .",
    "because of the scaling properties of equation([eq : sommdiff2 ] ) the behavior of the sommerfeld enhancement as a function of @xmath50 can actually be read off along diagonals in the plane.,title=\"fig : \" ]    equation  ( [ eq : sommdiff2 ] ) can also be numerically integrated efficiently , by integrating the solution @xmath51 inwards from a radius satisfying @xmath52 in the coulomb regime ( @xmath53 ) this means that the initial value for the integration should be such that @xmath54 ; otherwise we should start at @xmath55 .",
    "figure [ fig : sommb34 ] shows the sommerfeld enhancement in the parameter plane made of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "all of the qualitative features we discussed above are present : in the coulomb regime ( lower part of the two panels ) we see that the enhancement scales as @xmath56 , saturating at @xmath58 when @xmath56 becomes small ; the fact that the upper left corner of both panels is approximately the same shows that the sommerfeld enhancement saturates at @xmath46 ; the sharp diagonal lines in the upper right of both panels show the resonance region , in which the enhancement is sharply peaked .",
    "because of the scaling properties of equation  ( [ eq : sommdiff2 ] ) , shifting @xmath59 is equivalent to shifting both @xmath60 and @xmath61 by the same amount . therefore , the @xmath21 behavior of the enhancement can also be read off from these figures along diagonals .",
    "inspection of the resonance diagonals in the second panel of figure [ fig : sommb34 ] shows that the enhancement grows as @xmath20 in these regions .",
    "of course , when considering the sommerfeld enhancement of a halo of a certain velocity dispersion @xmath62 we need to average the sommerfeld enhancement over the distribution of relative velocities of that halo .",
    "we will approximate the one - particle velocity distribution of the halo as a single truncated maxwell - boltzmann distribution with velocity dispersion @xmath62 @xmath63 this approximation of a single maxwell - boltzmann distribution for the velocity distribution means that we assume that the halo has a constant velocity dispersion over the halo , i.e. , that the halo is isothermal .",
    "this is not necessarily the case  indeed , it is not if we believe that the density profiles of dm  halos are well fit by einasto or nfw  profiles  but it is not a bad assumption for intermediate distances from the halo s center , i.e. , between the innermost and outermost parts of the halo @xcite .",
    "a more detailed treatment of the sommerfeld enhancement in subhalos should take the non - uniform velocity dispersion in subhalos into account .",
    "note that in the pure @xmath14 regime the averaging will tend to sustain the @xmath14 behavior up to a factor @xmath64 , as we have that @xmath65 since the truncation does not significantly influence the result of these integrals .",
    "similarly , in the resonance region the @xmath66 behavior is conserved by the averaging .",
    "when the enhancement has leveled off the averaging has no effect .",
    "+    in figure [ fig : sommavg ] we show this averaged sommerfeld enhancement for four different decades of velocity dispersion .",
    "the overall behavior of the sommerfeld enhancement seen in figure [ fig : sommb34 ] is indeed conserved well by the averaging : this has to do with the fact that the most probable relative velocity in a maxwell - boltzmann relative velocity distribution is the velocity dispersion .",
    "the sommerfeld enhancement attains very large values for subhalos with very small velocity dispersions , mostly , but not exclusively , in the resonance regions .",
    "this means that the smallest subhalos that exist in cdm  will get large boosts to their dmannihilation from sommerfeld enhancement .",
    "the photon flux from dm  annihilation from a solid angle @xmath67 along a given line - of - sight ( los ) is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69  is the threshold energy of the detector , @xmath70 denotes ( possibly ) different final states of the dm  annihilation , @xmath71 is the spectrum of the annihilation to that state , @xmath72 is the annihilation cross section to state @xmath70 ( without the sommerfeld enhancement ) , @xmath73 is the sommerfeld enhancement which we have factored out of the cross section , and @xmath74 is the dm  density along the line - of - sight .",
    "we emphasize that this framework also allows us to consider different final annihilation products , such as the electrons and positrons observed by pamela / atic .",
    "we will focus our analysis on the `` structure quantity '' @xmath75(@xmath76 ) , which we define here as @xmath77 this structure quantity does not only depend on the mass and internal properties of the dm  halos in which we are interested , it depends on the particle physics parameters as well .",
    "we will keep all of the other factors in equation  ( [ eq : flux ] ) fixed .",
    "however , in order to derive actual numbers for the photon flux from dm  annihilation , we briefly describe the other quantities appearing in equation([eq : flux ] ) .      for the annihilation cross section",
    "prior to any sommerfeld enhancement we will adopt the fiducial value @xmath78",
    "@xmath6 s@xmath7 , and we choose a fiducial mass for the dm  particle of @xmath15  = 700 gev .",
    "the energy spectrum of the dm  annihilation depends on the model used to describe the dm  and its interactions ; it is outside of the scope of this paper to provide a detailed treatment of this for different dm  models .",
    "therefore , we will adopt an annihilation spectrum for dm  annihilation into photons appropriate for the newer models that were proposed to explain the pamela / atic results .",
    "specifically , we use a gamma ray spectrum from a cascade annihilation model . in these models the dm  annihilates into a new light degree of freedom which then in turn decays into leptons and photons . the injection spectrum per dm  annihilation",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath79 in which @xmath80 is the electromagnetic coupling constant and @xmath81 is the mass of the leptons created in the process @xmath82 .",
    "integrating this spectrum using an energy range appropriate for _ fermi _",
    "we find that @xmath83 we find a similar number if we integrate the spectrum from one cascade step .",
    "it is interesting to note that these photon spectra have fewer photons in them , about an order of magnitude less , than the annihilation spectra from neutralino annihilation which are often used @xcite .",
    "of course , since the energy spectrum contributes a multiplicative factor to the dmannihilation flux , the effect of different annihilation spectra can be incorporated by simply multiplying our results with the appropriate factor .",
    "since the photon flux from dm  annihilations depends on the density squared of the dm the exact form of the inner density profile has important ramifications for the detectability of dmannihilation .",
    "the density profile of dark matter halos has been discussed extensively in the last few years . while the shape of the outer density profile seems to have converged in the various numerical simulations of dm  halos and",
    "a consensus has been reached , the detailed shape of the inner density profile is still a matter of debate . the main point of contention is whether the density profile is cusped near the center of the dm  halo , and if so , how steep this cusp is , or whether the density asymptotes to a constant value at the center .",
    "since this discussion has a non - negligible impact on the prospects for dm  annihilation detection , we will briefly discuss the various plausible density profiles .",
    "the inner structure of dm  halos is one of the key predictions of the cdm  paradigm , and over a decade ago it was shown that the spherically averaged density profiles of dm  halos are well described by a universal profile , the so - called nfw  profile @xcite , depending only on the virial mass of the halo and its concentration .",
    "moreover , the concentration was shown to depend systematically on the halo mass @xcite .",
    "this profile was found to provide a good fit to many numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while there seems to be a consensus between different numerical simulations on the shape of the outer density profile , no agreement was reached on the inner density structure of the dm  halos found in the simulations .",
    "the nfw  profile has an inner slope of -1 , other studies , however , found evidence for steeper inner slopes @xcite , shallower inner slopes @xcite , or did nt find any convergence toward a power - law behavior @xcite .",
    "even the universality of the density profile has been brought into question @xcite .",
    "more recently , high - resolution numerical simulations have essentially ruled out the steepest cusps , such as moore s profile , which has an inner cusp a with logarithmic slope of -1.5 , however steeper inner cusps than the original nfw  profile are still observed in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "other recent simulations find inner slopes that are shallower than an nfw  profile @xcite .",
    "it also has become apparent in recent years that the inner density profile of dm  halos might not be described by a power - law divergence , but that , on the contrary , the logarithmic slope becomes ever shallower , leading to a cored density profile @xcite .",
    "therefore , density profiles such as the einasto profile have been shown to provide an excellent fit to the numerical simulations with the highest resolution yet @xcite .",
    "the implications of the exact form of the inner density profile have been widely discussed before in the context of various dmannihilation models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "roughly speaking , the annihilation flux is smaller for inner density profiles which are cored , and larger for inner density profiles which show a cuspy behavior .",
    "the steeper the slope of the inner cusp , the larger the dm  annihilation flux ( for obvious reasons ) .",
    "since the core vs.  cusp debate is still undecided we will consider dm  distribution models of both types .",
    "the cuspy dm  profile we will use is a generalized nfw  profile ( gnfw ) : @xmath84 in which @xmath85  is a characteristic density and @xmath86  a characteristic ( scale-)radius .",
    "the original nfw  profile is recovered for @xmath87 = 1 @xcite , which we will use as the fiducial model in what follows .",
    "varying the value of the inner logarithmic slope @xmath87 will allow us to describe the effect of steeper and shallower inner slopes than the nfw  model .",
    "note that this functional form does _ not _ include the exact form of moore s profile ; this need not concern us since inner cusps as steep as moore s profile are excluded by the latest numerical simulations .",
    "the contribution of the dm  density profile on the structure quantity @xmath75  can be simply evaluated in the context of any density model . as in ref .",
    "@xcite we assume that the distance to the subhalo @xmath88  is much larger than the scale - radius of the dmhalo . for an nfw  profile 90% of",
    "the flux originates from the region within one scale - radius , and we will , conservatively , only take contributions to the dm  annihilation flux coming from this region for all of the different profiles .",
    "therefore , we find that @xmath89 the normalization of this relationship depends on the logarithmic slope of the inner cusp and is given by @xmath90 the normalization for the nfw  profile is @xmath91 and it depends strongly on the value of the logarithmic slope of the inner density profile , as can be seen in figure [ fig : normgammanfw ] .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : normgammanfw ] shows the fraction of the dmannihilation flux coming from region within one scale - radius of the halo . for reasonable values of the inner slope",
    "this fraction is in the range 80 to 95% .",

    ", we can relate the parameters @xmath100 of the gnfw  profile to the parameters @xmath101 of the einasto model by calculating the radius at which the logarithmic slope of the density versus radius profile equals -2 .",
    "thus , we find that @xmath102    note that the dm  annihilation flux from the einasto profile , although it seems larger from figs .",

    "the density can then be expressed in terms of the concentration by using the definition of the virial mass given in equation  ( [ eq : virialmass ] ) .",
    "another pair of parameters that one can use to characterize the dmdensity profile is the maximum circular velocity @xmath118  and the radius at which this maximum occurs , @xmath119 .",
    "these parameters are especially well - suited when dealing with numerical simulations , since they can be readily read off from the raw simulation data .",
    "the circular velocity is given by @xmath120 in which @xmath121 and @xmath122 is defined in equation([eq : hypergeometric ] ) in the case of a gnfw  profile and is given by @xmath123 $ ] in the case of an einasto profile .",

    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] here we have introduced the subhalo mass function @xmath131 , which gives the abundance of subhalos of mass @xmath132 .    before proceeding we should specify the upper and lower limits of the integral appearing in equation  ( [ eq : boost ] ) .",
    "the integration over ever smaller substructures is cut - off at the size of the smallest subhalos .",
    "the mass scale at which this cut - off occurs is the thermal free - streaming scale , a dm  model - dependent quantity , which in many dm  models lies in the range 10@xmath133 to 10@xmath134 @xmath135@xcite .",
    "the upper limit to this integral is some fraction @xmath136 of the halo mass @xmath76 , since the abundance of substructure does not continue up to this mass scale . in the following",
    "we will set @xmath136 equal to 0.1 .    in order to calculate the total boost from substructure to the annihilation cross section , we will write all of the quantities appearing in equation  ( [ eq : boost ] ) as a function of the mass @xmath132 .",
    "for instance , from numerical simulations , the subhalo mass function is well constrained to follow a power - law type behavior : @xmath137 the value of the exponent @xmath138 is still under debate .",
    "the two highest resolution @xmath139-body simulations yet , the aquarius  and via lacteaprojects , both find values for @xmath138 that put roughly equal amounts of mass per subhalo mass decade . while the via lactea  simulation seems to prefer a value @xmath140 @xcite , which would lead to a logarithmically diverging total mass in substructures if the subhalo abundance were not cut off at the thermal free - streaming limit of the dark matter , the aquarius  project prefers a value @xmath141 @xcite . as the aquarius  project has made detailed convergence studies that support their claim for a value of @xmath138 that is shallower than -1 , we will adopt the value @xmath141 as our fiducial value , although even shallower slopes have also been observed @xcite .",
    "the same slope has also been observed in other simulations @xcite .    with the exponent",
    "@xmath138 fixed , we turn to the normalization of the relation given in equation  ( [ eq : massfraction ] ) . again , different high - resolution numerical simulations give different answers to this question as it relates to the abundance of subhalos of galactic subhalos .",
    "the problem of the normalization is complicated by the fact that numerical simulations have only recently begun to be able to resolve substructure in subhalos in a galaxy - size halo .",
    "while the simulations generally agree that the resolved substructure abundance of subhalos in the host halo adds up to @xmath142% of the total mass of the halo @xcite , the question of whether the substructure abundance in subhalos is just a scaled - down version of the substructure abundance in the host halo remains unresolved .",
    "one would not expect the abundance to be self - similar , since , while substructure in both the main host halo and subhalos gets diminished by tidal disruptions , substructure in the subhalos does not get replenished by the infall of halos from the field , as is the case for the host halo .",
    "nevertheless , many numerical simulations do find approximately self - similar substructure abundances @xcite .",
    "recently , the aquarius  simulation has concluded from its simulation that the substructure abundance is not self - similar , although the deviation from the self - similar relation is small @xcite .",

    ". however , the concentration of subhalos is generally larger than the concentration of field halos of the same mass as a result of tidal mass - loss @xcite .",

    "therefore , we need to relate the velocity dispersion of a dm  subhalo to its mass .",
    "it is important to note that all we really need is an approximate relationship between the velocity dispersion and the halo mass which fits well the range of galactic size halos to a scale not much smaller than the mass scale of the smallest dwarf spheroidals known today , since in most cases the sommerfeld enhancement will saturate at velocity dispersions of the order of the velocity dispersion of the dwarf spheroidals .",

    "alternatively , we could use the circular velocity at the virial radius as a measure of the velocity dispersion . in the case of an nfw  profile",

    "we define the total boost for a given subhalo mass as ( see equation ) @xmath158 in which @xmath159 is the sommerfeld enhancement for a halo of mass @xmath76 and @xmath160 is the substructure boost for a halo of that mass , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : boost ] ) . this total boost for subhalos of mass @xmath76 = @xmath161",
    "@xmath135  and @xmath76 = @xmath162 @xmath135  calculated by following the procedure outlined in the previous subsection is shown in figure [ fig : subboost ] ( _ top panels _ ) .",
    "it is immediately obvious that the total boost factors can get very large in certain regions of the parameter space spanned by @xmath16/@xmath15and @xmath56 : boosts vary between @xmath163 to @xmath1 .",
    "these masses correspond to the typical masses of the classical and newly - discovered dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) and as such their velocity dispersions are of the order @xmath164 .",
    "the pattern of resonance regions and non - resonance regions that appears for the pure sommerfeld enhancement ( as shown in figure [ fig : sommavg ] ) is also apparent in these plots of the total boosts , however , it is noteworthy that the resonances seems to be more highly peaked than they were in the pure sommerfeld enhancement case , and that the boost the lower half of the parameter space , i.e. , for smaller values of @xmath16/@xmath15 , are higher than one would expect from the pure sommerfeld enhancement combined with a boost factor from pure density enhancements .",
    "this is confirmed by looking at the `` reduced boost '' defined as @xmath165 in which @xmath166 is the boost we would find if we turned off the sommerfeld enhancement in the calculation of the total boost , i.e. , the boost we would get if we set @xmath167 equal to one in equation([eq : boost ] ) .",
    "this @xmath168 corresponds to the boost factor that has been used before to estimate the total boost from density enhancements in dsphs  and it is generally @xmath169(10 ) .",
    "this reduced boost therefore divides out the contribution of the sommerfeld enhancement of the top - level subhalo and the boost from the overdensities in lower - level halos , and it would be equal to one if there were no extra boost coming from the fact that the substructures are kinematically colder than the main subhalo .",
    "as we can see in figure [ fig : subboost ] ( _ bottom panels _ ) , in various parts of the yukawa coupling parameter space this reduced boost is equal to one such that there is no extra boosts caused by the lower velocity dispersion in the substructures .",
    "this is mainly the case for large values of the parameter @xmath16/@xmath15 , since the sommerfeld enhancement , in the 1/@xmath49 regime , levels off around @xmath170 , and since the top - level subhalo has a velocity dispersion of @xmath171 this means that the sommerfeld enhancement has mostly saturated at these large values of @xmath16/@xmath15 , even in regions of parameter space in which @xmath56 is small .",
    "indeed , in the 1/@xmath49 regime the sommerfeld enhancement is @xmath172 @xmath173 @xmath174 for @xmath175 , such that the sommerfeld enhancement has fully saturated over the whole @xmath56 range for large values of @xmath16/@xmath15  ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "however , the sommerfeld enhancement has not saturated in all regions of parameter space at this mass scale , and for smaller values of @xmath16/@xmath15and especially in resonance regions , the reduced boost can reach high values , signaling a large extra boost caused by the kinematically coldness of the substructure . for small values of @xmath16/@xmath15",
    "we see that we can get boosts that are an order of magnitude to two orders of magnitude larger than what we would expect from naively combining the sommerfeld enhancement from the velocity dispersion of the subhalo with the boost from density enhancements alone .",
    "this can be easily understood as being a consequence of the fact that the sommerfeld enhancement has not saturated yet at the mass scale of the top - level subhalo , such that it can be boosted up to it saturation point by the contribution from the kinematically colder substructure .",
    "the largest values of the reduced boost are found in the resonance regions . in these regions",
    "the sommerfeld enhancement both grows faster with decreasing relative velocity as well as saturates at a much larger value of the enhancement .",
    "both of these effects conspire to give very large extra boosts .",
    "the resonance regions are clearly distinguishable in this plot of the reduced boost as 45@xmath177 lines .",
    "because the resonance regions are so narrow the apparent extra boosts in different resonances seems to vary greatly , but this is mostly caused by the finite resolution of this figure .",
    "extra boosts up to @xmath178 are obtained in these resonances , and these extra boosts increase along the resonances when decreasing @xmath56 , again caused by the higher saturation level for smaller @xmath57 values .",
    "the total boost factors obtained by assuming an nfw  dark matter density profile do not depend much on the inner slope of the density profile .",
    "this is mainly because the calculation of the boost only considers _ relative _ luminosities , for which the difference in normalization of the @xmath179 relation for different inner slopes is irrelevant , and because the mass of the subhalo is only weakly affected by the value of the inner slope ",
    "the function @xmath111 is only a weak function of the inner slope .",
    "this is confirmed by calculating the total boost for a @xmath180 @xmath135subhalo for a subhalo with a very shallow inner cusp as well as for a subhalo with a very steep inner slope .",
    "these are shown in figure [ fig : subboostprofiles ] ( _ top panels _ ) , and , from comparing this with the total boost shown in figure [ fig : subboost ] , it is clear that the inner slope does not affect the total boost caused by substructure , neither the overall magnitude of the effect nor the structure in the ( @xmath16/@xmath15,@xmath56 ) plane . the main difference in dm  annihilation flux between the different dark matter density profiles",
    "is therefore given by the normalization of the @xmath181 relation , shown in figure [ fig : normgammanfw ] .",
    "if the dm  density profiles of halos is better described by an einasto profile then the substructure boost is affected more strongly by the shape parameter @xmath56 which basically describes how cored the dm  density profile is .",
    "changing @xmath56  has a greater impact on changing the overall dm  density profile and therefore also plays a larger role in the relation between the characteristic density , the concentration , and the mass of the subhalo .",
    "the total boosts for a @xmath76 = @xmath161 @xmath135  subhalo is shown in figure [ fig : subboostprofiles ] ( _ bottom panels _ ) for two different values of the shape parameter @xmath56 which span the range found in numerical simulations ( for values of @xmath56greater than 0.2 the behavior basically saturates at that of @xmath56  = 0.2 ) . for @xmath56",

    "that @xmath56  is larger the substructure boost reaches slightly larger values than for the gnfwdensity profile .",
    "thus , as was the case for the gnfw  profile , the impact of the different normalization of the @xmath182 for different values of @xmath56  will play a leading role in the difference between the different profile shapes .

    "[ fig : subboostslope ] ( _ top panels _ ) we show the effect of both a shallower as well as a steeper subhalo mass function .",
    "the value of @xmath183 corresponds to the shallow slope found in ref .",
    "we see that the effect of such a shallow slope is to seriously reduce the substructure boost , which is simply a consequence of the fact that for a shallower slope less substructure is found in smaller and more concentrated clumps .",
    "a steeper slope such as @xmath140 , as was found in the recent via lacteasimulation @xcite leads to a substructure boost which is about an order of magnitude larger than for the fiducial @xmath184 value .",
    "the effect of the thermal free - streaming scale of dm  on the substructure boost is shown in figure [ fig : subboostslope ] ( _ bottom panels _ ) .",
    "this effect is relatively large since the free - streaming scale sets the scale of the smallest and most concentrated dm  halos and raising or lowering this scale therefore changes an important part of the contribution to the substructure boost .",
    "for very large values of the free - streaming scale such as @xmath185 @xmath135 , the substructure boost becomes about an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "when the free - streaming scale becomes very small , much of the substructure is in very small , cold clumps , such that the total boost becomes about an order of magnitude larger .",
    "besides detection of dm  annihilation from the galactic center or the diffuse component from the galactic halo , there idea exists that the best candidates for dm  annihilation detection might be the dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies ( dsphs ) of our galaxy , since the dwarf galaxies are believed to be the most dark matter dominated structures in the universe , and the dm  annihilation signal coming from them would be much easier to distinguish from background sources than , e.g. , would be the case for dm  annihilation photons coming from the galactic center . that dsphs  make good candidates for dmannihilation detection has been much discussed before , especially for the `` classical '' , or pre - sdss , dsphs@xcite .",

    "the dm  annihilation signal from these low - surface brightness galaxies is complicated by the dearth of kinematical tracers of the dm  distribution and their contamination with background stars @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , detailed studies have constrained the dm  density and velocity dispersion profiles of some of these dsphs@xcite .",

    "we use the velocity dispersions determined for these galaxies in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to calculate the substructure boost to the dm  annihilation cross section we need the mass of the dsphs .",
    "many definitions of the mass of the galaxy could be used here , among the more appropriate ones is the mass contained inside the tidal radius , i.e. , the radius inside of which material in the dsph  is safe from being tidally stripped by the galaxy .",
    "however , since we are considering the dm  annihilation flux coming from within the radius @xmath94  we will use the mass contained within this radius to calculate the substructure boost .",
    "this is more appropriate since ( 1 ) it can be calculated straightforwardly from the dm  density profile of the dsph  and ( 2 ) the mass contained within @xmath94  is really the more relevant mass to calculate the substructure boost , since we are only interested in contributions to the dm  annihilation flux coming from within the radius @xmath94 .    because of the similarities between some of the dm  density profiles of the dsphs  in table [ tab : dsphs ] we do not show the predicted annihilation fluxes for all of the dsphs  in figure [ fig : dsph ] , instead focusing on a representative sample of them . inspection of table [ tab : dsphs ] shows that annihilation flux of the dsphs  not shown here will be similar to that of the ones shown in figure [ fig : dsph ] .    at this point",
    "we can also make a connection to another quantity that is often used to describe the astrophysical contribution to the dmannihilation signal , @xmath187 .",
    "this quantity is generally defined as @xmath188 and is therefore equal to the line - of - sight integral over the density squared averaged over solid angle .",
    "we can define a slight variant of this which takes into account the sommerfeld enhancement @xmath189 in which @xmath38  is the sommerfeld enhancement averaged over the distribution of relative velocities .",
    "if we work this out for the dwarf spheroidals , using the expression from equation([eq : lumrhosrsnfw ] ) for the line - of - sight integral averaged over the solid angle spanned by the scale radius @xmath86  we find that this @xmath190  is approximately equal to the total boost @xmath191 , with a pre - factor @xmath169(1 ) . therefore in the case of the dsphs  studied here the @xmath190  can be approximately read off from the top panels of figure [ fig : subboost ] .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig : dsph ] that the dm  annihilation flux predicted to be coming from the dsphs  is very large in a large class of models .",

    "in conclusion we can say that in a scenario in which there is sommerfeld enhancement there is much more hope to detect dark subhalos than in more conventional scenarios , but that the details of the prediction depend strongly on the underlying particle physics .",
    "the recently proposed sommerfeld enhancement to the dm  annihilation cross section forces us to reconsider statements made in the past about the expected signal of dm  annihilation from cold substructures in the halo of the galaxy .",
    "since the sommerfeld enhancement depends critically on the velocity dispersion of the substructure in question , as well as on the details of the particle physics model used to describe the attractive ( or , possibly , repulsive ) force that gives rise to the sommerfeld enhancement , the contributions from the specific particle physics model and the details of the dmdistribution in the substructure can no longer be as cleanly separated as they have been before .",
    "this means that in a scenario in which there is a significant sommerfeld enhancement , previous claims of `` particle physics independent '' conclusions about the dm  annihilation signal from substructure ( e.g. , @xcite ) need to be reconsidered in this new framework .",
    "this complicates the analysis but it opens up new possibilities for detecting dm  annihilation and learning about the properties of the dark sector . as we showed above , the combination of the sommerfeld enhancement and the substructure that is believed to exist down to small scales leads to very large boost factors because of the combined effect of the higher densities of small subhalos as well as the fact that they are kinematically colder than the larger halos .",
    "this leads to predictions for the dmannihilation gamma - ray flux that are much larger than was previously believed . as we showed in sec .",
    "[ sec : dsphs ] , in models in which there is a significant sommerfeld enhancement at the level of the galactic halo and its subhalos , the dm  annihilation signal from the dwarf spheroidals outshines the extragalactic background flux and the predicted gamma - ray fluxes are so large that they should be detectable by _",
    "fermi_. given a detailed knowledge of the density structure and velocity dispersion profile of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies , much can then be learned if we are able to detect the dm  annihilation signal coming from these dsphs , by considering the relative signal and using the results of sec .",
    "[ sec : dsphs ] , or by using the detailed velocity dispersion profile of the dsphs  @xcite .",
    "we have focused on the consequences of the sommerfeld enhancement for dm  subhalos in a @xmath2cdm  cosmology , using the latest results from high - resolution numerical @xmath139-body simulations to inform our assumptions about the abundance and properties of the substructure . under these assumptions we were able to show that there are very large boosts to the dm  annihilation cross section from the combined effect of substructure boosts and sommerfeld enhancement in large parts of the parameter space consisting of the parameters of the attractive yukawa type force between the dm  particles which is responsible for the sommerfeld enhancement .",
    "these regions of parameter space are in no way unrealistic .",
    "indeed , in one of the most straightforward interpretations of the atic / pamela results , the sharp cut - off around 1 tev seen in the atic spectrum is interpreted as being a consequence of the fact that the dark matter mass is about 700 gev .",
    "the absence of an excess in anti - protons similar to the excess in positrons seen by pamela can be explained by positing that the dark matter particles annihilate to an intermediate boson @xmath29 , which is lighter than a proton ( or even , lighter than the effective quark mass @xmath217 ) in order to kinematically forbid the annihilation into protons @xcite .",
    "this naturally leads to a @xmath16/@xmath15@xmath218 @xmath23 .",
    "the coupling constant of the new force in the dark sector is also generally @xmath219 @xcite .",
    "thus , from figure [ fig : subboost ] , we expect there to be a rather large boost to the dm  annihilation cross section in these models .",
    "this leads to particularly large dm  annihilation signals predicted for the dsphs  ( see figure [ fig : dsph ] ) .",
    "we have not discussed the substructure boost to the dm  annihilation signal from unresolved substructure , such as very small subhalos and dm  tidal debris from disrupted subhalos , in the galactic halo .",
    "this is , however , interesting in the light of the sommerfeld enhancement , since it might lead to a different prediction about the relative magnitudes of the annihilation signal coming from the resolved galactic halo and unresolved halo , as well from the resolved substructures in the galactic halos .",
    "it is already clear that in the generic 1/@xmath49 sommerfeld enhancement the main halo , with its typical velocity dispersion of @xmath220 km s@xmath7 , will receive a much smaller enhancement than the dsphs , with their typical velocity dispersions of 10 km s@xmath7 .",
    "this , however , ignores the effects of saturation and resonances , which might be important in the specific particle physics model adopted for the sommerfeld enhancement . additionally ,",
    "while the velocity dispersion of the galactic halo might be of the order of 100 km s@xmath7 , the actual velocity dispersion relevant to the sommerfeld enhancement might be much smaller for halo dm  particles .",
    "if a large fraction of the dmin the galactic halo is part of a cold stream  and various numerical simulations predict that large parts of the halo , if not all of the halo , are made up of such cold streams with typical velocity dispersions of the order of 1 km s@xmath7 @xcite  then , in addition to any boost caused by density enhancements in the stream @xcite , the boost from the sommerfeld enhancement could also play a large role , as the relevant relative velocity of dm  particles is set by the velocity dispersion of particles in the stream , and not by the velocity dispersion of the streams in the halo , which is what the 100 km s@xmath7 galactic halo velocity dispersion corresponds to in these scenarios .",
    "thus , the expected dmannihilation signal from the main halo could be much larger than that naively expected for a halo with a velocity dispersion of 100 km s@xmath7 ."
