    "masjuan , arriola and broniowski ( referred to later as mab for brevity ) report a new analysis of the slopes of trajectories @xcite @xcite .",
    "they adopt a @xmath4 criterion which increases the errors assigned to resonance masses by up to a factor 20 .",
    "they take @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are masses and widths of fitted resonances .",
    "their rationale is that the extrapolation to poles off the real @xmath8-axis may be inaccurate by one half - width .",
    "the essential point of disagreement with mab is whether this assumption is justified or not .",
    "my point is that large uncertainties in the extrapolation to the pole arise only when a strong @xmath9-wave threshold opens in the immediate vicinity of the resonance .",
    "an example is @xmath10 which decays strongly to the @xmath11 s - wave , opening precisely at 1565 mev . in this case",
    ", there is a large dispersive contribution to the real part of the amplitude , as discussed below in section iii .",
    "clearly one should be alert to such thresholds",
    ". however , most high mass resonances have many open channels and such effects are small . after eliminating the special cases , there is no support for the assumption of eq .",
    "( 1 ) as the general case .    to illustrate the effect of the increased errors , it is sufficient to quote one example .",
    "the particle data group ( pdg ) quotes a mass for the @xmath12 as @xmath13 mev @xcite . for @xmath14",
    "the pdg uses two measurements with masses @xmath15 and @xmath16 mev . from these two states ,",
    "mab find a slope of @xmath17 gev@xmath1 .",
    "this implies an error in the mass difference of 203 mev .",
    "this is entirely inconsistent with crystal barrel assessment of errors for the analytic continuation to the pole .",
    "further disagreements arise from several sources . there",
    "do exist some missing states , and that must be realised in drawing trajectories .",
    "another point is that it is well known that @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xmath20 ground states are anomalously low in mass compared with a straight trajectory through @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xmath23 radial states .",
    "there are indications that this is also true for @xmath24 states .",
    "a third point is that there is almost certainly a @xmath25 glueball in the mass range 1370 to 1800 mev , but no present agreement on its identification .",
    "it will certainly mix with @xmath3 states , and this mixing makes the masses of @xmath26 components uncertain .",
    "a primary problem is that mab do not distinguish clearly between @xmath20 and @xmath27 states .",
    "conventional wisdom is that @xmath28-state light mesons appear at masses 12001300 mev , @xmath29 states at 16001700 mev and f states near 2000 mev .",
    "however , they assign the third @xmath20 @xmath30 state a mass of @xmath31 mev , i.e. @xmath32 mev above the @xmath33 and @xmath34 . the result is a slope for the @xmath20 @xmath30 trajectory @xmath35 times larger than other trajectories .",
    "they also replace the best determinations of trajectories for @xmath36 , @xmath37 mesons ( where there are 10 sets of data ) by poorer determinations of @xmath38 @xmath37 mesons , where there are no polarisation data to separate @xmath39 and @xmath40 mesons , hence much larger errors for masses .",
    "they also replace the crystal barrel determination of the mass of the @xmath41 by including a possibly biased mass determination from data on @xmath42 .",
    "that is not a good idea , since mixing with the @xmath43 amplitude can confuse the situation .    in order to present the discrepancies with the slopes of trajectories assigned by crystal barrel ( cb )",
    ", the slopes of all trajectories are redetermined here from final cb data sets and tabulated for comparison with the slopes of mab .",
    "the table of results makes the differences immediately apparent .",
    "the crystal barrel has produced extensive data on formation of high mass mesons in the process @xmath44 , where @xmath45 stands for a resonance and there are 18 channels of all - neutral final states available . ref .",
    "@xcite reviews the data and technical details .",
    "the detector covers @xmath46 of the solid angle with caesium iodide crystals which measure all - neutral final states .",
    "quantum numbers fall into four non - interfering families @xmath36 or 1 , @xmath47 or -1 .    for @xmath36 , @xmath47 , there are data on 6 channels : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "there are also differential cross sections and polarisation data for @xmath54 from the ps172 @xcite and an earlier experiment at the cern ps @xcite .",
    "these are vital for two reasons .",
    "first , they separate @xmath39 and @xmath40 states .",
    "secondly , polarisation is phase sensitive and reduces errors on fitted masses and widths substantially .",
    "the improvement in mass determination from polarisation data can be up to a factor 4 because of its phase sensitivity .    in the @xmath55 data",
    "there are prominent @xmath56 and @xmath57 signals , easily identified from their strong angular dependence .",
    "they are determined accurately in mass and width from data at 9 beam momenta from 600 to 1940 mev / c .",
    "these states serve as interferometers for all lower spin triplet partial waves .",
    "there is also a lucky break , that two singlet states also appear prominently : an @xmath58 in @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the @xmath50 data in the channel @xmath61 .",
    "a complete set of @xmath24 states appears in two towers of resonances centred near 2000 and 2270 mev . for @xmath38 , @xmath62 ,",
    "an almost complete set of states also appears , but with poor identification of @xmath20 states . for @xmath38 , @xmath47 , there are actually two solutions , with one of them close to the @xmath36 , @xmath63 solution , as one would expect for light quarks with small mass differences . for @xmath36 , @xmath62 ,",
    "statistics are low for @xmath64 and the @xmath65 data have the problem that the broad @xmath66 interferes all over the dalitz plot .    the @xmath67 states lie systematically @xmath68 mev above the @xmath28 states , because high @xmath69 states need to overcome a centrifugal barrier in order to resonate .",
    "the @xmath29 states lie roughly midway ; @xmath9 and @xmath70 states continue the sequence .    the @xmath71 is widely accepted as the @xmath43 partner of @xmath72 .",
    "production of @xmath71 in the crystal barrel experiment is extremely weak .",
    "it is detected at the 12@xmath73 level in @xmath74 in flight @xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that @xmath75 annihilation is dominantly to @xmath24 final states - hardly a surprise .",
    "this conclusion is supported and quantified by a combined analysis of data on @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath52 and @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "amplitudes for decay to @xmath52 and @xmath78 depend on the well known composition of @xmath79 and @xmath80 in terms of singlet and octet states and the pseudoscalar mixing angle .",
    "the observed state @xmath45 is expressed as a linear composition @xmath81 .",
    "the result is that @xmath82 , i.e. a maximum of @xmath83 in amplitude , for all observed states with the exception of @xmath84 ( which is taken as a glueball candidate , but could possibly be due to unexpectedly strong mixing between closely spaced @xmath24 and @xmath43 states ) .",
    "the allocation mab make between @xmath24 and @xmath43 states is in conflict with the fact that cb states are dominantly @xmath24 .",
    "the partial wave analysis of cb data is documented in section 4 of ref .",
    "this describes systematic checks which have been made on the identification of resonances , particularly their stability as the number of fitted resonances was changed .",
    "the following sections illustrate the result and discuss individual resonances and their argand diagrams . for @xmath36 , @xmath47 ,",
    "all states have statistical significance @xmath85 standard deviations except for the @xmath86 , which is @xmath87 but observed clearly in four sets of data .",
    "two states , @xmath88 and @xmath89 have rather large errors for masses .",
    "regge trajectories are discussed in section 9 . for channels @xmath90 and @xmath64 , polarisations of @xmath30 are determined by the angular dependence of decays to @xmath91 and are very revealing .",
    "the interpretation of this polarisation is important and discussed in sections 7.1 and 8 .",
    "there is one non - standard piece of nomenclature .",
    "these polarisations are described as vector polarisation @xmath92 .",
    "strictly , the standard nomenclature is that this should be called @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is tensor polarisation .",
    "one should be aware in advance that states may deviate from straight trajectories because of dispersive effects on resonance masses .",
    "the strict form for the denominator of a breit - wigner amplitude is @xmath95 to make the principal value integral converge better , it is typical to make a subtraction on the resonance , although in principle this can be done at any mass ; @xmath96 is the @xmath8 value at threshold for each channel .",
    "the @xmath97 are coupling constants to every decay channel , and @xmath98 are the phase space for each final state , including centrifugal barriers and possible form factors . near the thresholds of important decay channels , a change in the imaginary part of the amplitude is accompanied by a corresponding real part so as to obey analyticity . at sharp thresholds , the imaginary part of the phase space rises linearly from threshold , and produces a cusp in the real part of the amplitude .",
    "this acts as an attractor @xcite .",
    "the @xmath99 and @xmath100 are attracted to the @xmath101 s - wave threshold .",
    "likewise the @xmath10 is attracted to the sharp threshold for the @xmath11 final state ; this attraction is augmented by a broader threshold in the @xmath102 channel , which has 3 times more events from the su(2 ) relation with @xmath11 .",
    "the pdg mass is taken from the @xmath103 channel , but the @xmath104 and @xmath105 channels are respectively a factor of 8.5 and a factor of 25 stronger than @xmath103 when integrated over the available mass range , see fig .",
    "5(b ) of baker et al @xcite . in that paper ,",
    "a dispersion relation was evaluated for the effect of both these channels ; the pole position was determined to be @xmath106 mev .",
    "this is lower than the @xmath107 of the pdg , but this is because of physics which is understood .",
    "-11.5 mm , @xmath37 observed in crystal barrel data in flight , plotted against radial excitation number @xmath108 ; masses are marked in mev . the average slope is adopted for all cases , so as to display discrepancies .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=453 ] -8 mm    for cb data in flight above the @xmath75 threshold , there is a conspicuous @xmath109 signal fitted as an @xmath36 , @xmath37 @xmath110 resonance at 2267 mev and clearly associated with the s - wave threshold effect , see figs .",
    "17 and 18 of ref .",
    "for @xmath38 , @xmath37 , there are signs of similar activity near the @xmath111 threshold , but this channel can not be reconstructed accurately enough in the very difficult final state @xmath112 .",
    "s - wave structure could arise at thresholds for @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , but is blurred out by convolution of the large widths of @xmath117 and @xmath118 with the @xmath119 .",
    "it would lead to structure distributed over @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , but in the absence of polarisation data can not be sorted out at present . for p - wave thresholds , the imaginary part of the amplitude increases as the cube of the momentum , and leads to negligible effects .",
    "the @xmath75 and @xmath123 total cross sections follow a @xmath124 variation , where @xmath125 is the relativistic velocity of the incident @xmath126 .",
    "the result is a strong cusp at the @xmath75 threshold in both @xmath127 and @xmath20 partial waves .",
    "this @xmath124 dependence is included into the partial wave analysis for these waves .",
    "this cusp will perturb masses of resonances near the threshold .",
    "data from novosibirsk on @xmath128 final states have a rapid mass variation close to the @xmath75 threshold @xcite .",
    "returning to the question of observed slopes of trajectories , each set of quantum numbers will be examined one by one , fitting the expected states to observed masses and errors , but paying particular attention to cases where states are missing or strongly displaced by dispersive effects .",
    "having done this , a grand average is taken of all slopes . as a guide , fig .",
    "1 shows the updated analysis of @xmath36 , @xmath37 states .",
    "table 1 lists slopes for all families of light mesons in gev@xmath1 .",
    "general comments are as follows .",
    "first , @xmath36 , @xmath37 states are best determined , because of the available polarisation data , which are very precise . for triplet states ,",
    "decays are possible for orbital angular momentum @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the ratio of coupling constants @xmath131 is tabulated in ref .",
    "@xcite , but not tabulated by the particle data group ; it is the basic guide to whether states have @xmath129 or @xmath132 .",
    "why should @xmath40 @xmath24 states decay preferentially to @xmath75 @xmath40 ?",
    "a feature of cb data is that @xmath67 states decay strongly to channels with high angular momentum .",
    "the origin of this is clearly a good overlap between wave functions of initial and final states .",
    "llanes - estrada et al .",
    "point out a formal analogy with the frank - condon principle of molecular physics consistent with this interpretation @xcite .",
    "it is immediately clear from the errors in the table that the @xmath4 weighting used by mab increases some errors by large amounts . from the agreement in many cases between cb and mab ,",
    "it is also clear that remaining discrepancies should be inspected closely .",
    "it is easiest to compare with results from mab in their section 3 , taking them in the reverse order to the publication , i.e. k to a. a clear picture of disagreements then arises step by step .",
    "the @xmath133 and @xmath134 states are considered in mab sec .",
    "3k . the cb approach is to fit @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath88 using their errors .",
    "the first two have small errors , with the result that the fit misses the weak @xmath88 by just over one standard deviation .",
    "neither @xmath137 nor @xmath138 is fitted well by the cb approach or that of mab . in the cb fit",
    ", a state is expected at 1660 mev , close to its isospin partner @xmath139 .",
    "the @xmath138 is naturally assigned as the @xmath43 analogue of @xmath135 ; the mass difference is close to that between @xmath72 and @xmath71 .",
    "longacre proposes that @xmath137 is a molecule where an @xmath140 pion circles a @xmath101 core @xcite . for @xmath134 ,",
    "the mab slope has an error a factor 9 larger than the cb value .",
    "sections j and i agree well on slopes between cb and mab for @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 states .    for @xmath134 ,",
    "it is clear from the slope of mab that they use a mass well above the cb determination of the mass of @xmath41 , @xmath145 mev ; it seems likely that it is replaced by the value @xmath146 mev from @xmath42 data .",
    "this is dangerous , since it may introduce mixing with @xmath43 . if one takes the weighted mean of the two masses quoted by the pdg @xcite for @xmath41 , namely @xmath147 mev , the slope is @xmath148 .",

    "@xcite agree between cb and mab for @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 states .",
    "section 3h considers @xmath30 states .",
    "mab and cb agree on the @xmath150 trajectory within errors .",
    "but mab put the @xmath151 on a trajectory with an @xmath152 observed in @xmath153 .",
    "this could be an @xmath43 state or could be due to an upward shift of the @xmath154 because of @xmath43 background .",
    "the consequence is that mab ignore the well known @xmath155 as a standard @xmath27 state .",
    "the scheme listed in the pdg meson summary tables takes the @xmath156 as a @xmath20 state and @xmath155 as @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath119 states run parallel , with @xmath157 as a @xmath20 state and the well established @xmath158 as @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath159 fits in as @xmath20 and @xmath160 as @xmath27 ; the @xmath161 states lie higher than @xmath24 states by a similar mass difference to that between @xmath72 and @xmath71 ( which is well established as @xmath43 ) . fitting the @xmath162 together with @xmath155",
    "gives a slope of @xmath163 , close to other cb slopes .",
    "fitting the remaining @xmath164 trajectory with states at 782,1425 and 2205 mev , but with two missing states gives a slope of @xmath165 .",
    "the fit to the second state however gives it a mass of 1329 mev .",
    "many authors have noticed this point .",
    "it could well be due to the fact that the ground state is abnormally low in mass , just as the @xmath21 and @xmath166 lie significantly below a straight line through @xmath167 , 3 and 4 radial excitations .",
    "section 3 g of ref .",
    "@xcite considers @xmath168 states . here",
    "physics remarks are required .",
    "one of the fundamentals of particle physics is chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "this was first proposed by gell - mann and l ' evy in 1960 @xcite .",
    "it became well known to theorists that the attracive @xmath169 interaction requires exchange of two correlated pions with a broad peak at 450650 mev , denoted by the @xmath170 .",
    "bicudo and ribiero provided a detailed account of how this arises @xcite .",
    "the mechanism today accounts for the low mass @xmath66 , @xmath171 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "it is now well understood @xcite how a crossover arises between these exceptional states and regular @xmath3 states near 1 gev .",
    "the surviving mixing above 1 gev is likely to push the @xmath172 @xmath173 states up in mass .",
    "this can explain the anomalously high masses of @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "a further complication for @xmath168 is the likely existence of a glueball in the mass range 15001800 mev , still obscure .",
    "a further point is that there is evidence @xcite that the @xmath176 claimed by gams has been confused with the @xmath177 candidate for the radial excitation of @xmath174 ; the @xmath177 is consistent with the bes ii @xmath173 peak observed at 1812 mev in @xmath178 decays@xcite .",
    "so , in summary , @xmath168 states are complex .",
    "conclusions about the @xmath168 slope are therefore ambiguous . using only the @xmath179 mass of @xmath174 and",
    "the mass of @xmath180 , the slope is @xmath181 gev@xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath174 decays dominantly to @xmath182 ; this introduces large dispersive effects on the mass . crystal barrel data at rest on @xmath183",
    "contain 600,000 precisely measured events and interference effects between the three @xmath103 components determine phase variations very precisely .",
    "the mass fitted to the @xmath179 channel is @xmath184 mev .",
    "however rapidly increasing phase space for its dominant @xmath102 decay channel moves the peak in @xmath182 data up by @xmath185 mev .",
    "pole positions on different sheets are given in table 4 of @xcite for @xmath174 and @xmath186 and are quite revealing .",
    "this strong threshold shifts the pole of @xmath174 by at most 17 mev from the peak in @xmath179 ; the fitted @xmath187 full - width is 325 mev .",
    "so in this extreme case , the shift in pole position is @xmath188 of the half - width . for the @xmath186 ,",
    "the shift in pole position is 8 mev from the nominal mass compared with a half - width of @xmath189 mev .",
    "these shifts are a factor at least 6 less than mab assume .",
    "mab construct two trajectories for what they take to be @xmath24 states and @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath24 trajectory starts with @xmath100 and finishes with @xmath190 . however , there is almost universal agreement today that @xmath100 and @xmath99 are not @xmath3 states but have dominant 4-quark composition @xcite .",
    "the @xmath100 decays dominantly to @xmath101 , not @xmath179 .",
    "bes ii quote a @xmath191 branching ratio @xmath192 @xcite ; this is one of the very few experiments which has data on both @xmath101 and @xmath179 .",
    "a further important source of information is the decay of @xmath193 .",
    "there is a conspicuous @xmath194 in the data and a further peak at @xmath190 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that they both have substantial @xmath43 components .",
    "so the mab @xmath24 trajectory looks unlikely .    on their @xmath43 trajectory ,",
    "mab start with @xmath174 and finish with @xmath180 .",
    "the @xmath174 is observed dominantly in decays to @xmath182 , largely @xmath102 .",
    "it has a branching ratio to @xmath101 of @xmath195 in cb data , so it does not look like an @xmath196 state . the last member of this trajectory is @xmath180 .",
    "this has been observed in crystal barrel data in decays to @xmath179 and @xmath52 @xcite with a flavour angle of @xmath197 , so it is certainly not a dominantly @xmath43 state .    section e of mab discusses @xmath198 , @xmath117 and @xmath199 states .",
    "this is again a complex story .",
    "they use the mass of @xmath99 , which is unwise in view of its association with chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the @xmath175 is well determined @xcite , but the signal for @xmath200 is very weak .",
    "an additional @xmath198 is to be expected somewhere between these two , but there are no data adequate to detect it ; finding spin 0 states is difficult . assuming this state has been missed , the slope from @xmath175 and @xmath200 is @xmath201 gev@xmath1 , but is probably affected by chiral symmetry breaking and is not used in the overall cb average for the slope .",
    "mab make the opposite assumption that this is the first radial excitation of @xmath175 and hence find a slope of @xmath202 .",
    "moving on to @xmath117 states , mab consider as an upper trajectory ( @xmath40 ) @xmath203 and @xmath204 and arrive at a similar slope to cb .",
    "for the @xmath39 trajectory , they take @xmath205 , @xmath107 and @xmath206 .",
    "this is to be compared with the well established @xmath118 trajectory @xmath72 , @xmath10 , @xmath207 , @xmath208 .",
    "they miss an @xmath117 state to be identified with the @xmath209 of anisovich et al .",
    "they find a slope @xmath210 compared with the cb determination @xmath211 .",
    "there is agreement between cb and mab for the @xmath199 slope .",
    "however , one comment is needed on the pdg determination of the mass .",
    "it is determined largely by the data of uman et al .",
    "@xcite . if one looks at their fig . 6 , the difference in @xmath4 between @xmath117 and @xmath199 is small . they do not consider the possibility that both @xmath117 and @xmath199 are present ; that would not be at all surprising .",
    "therefore the cb determination of the mass is preferred here .",
    "consider next @xmath118 states .",
    "the problem here is that mab do not discriminate between the @xmath39 states and @xmath40 , which are well separated in cb data .",
    "mab launch into four alternative scenarios , all of which have problems .    their @xmath212 trajectory is made from @xmath213 , @xmath214 and @xmath215 . the @xmath215 is not seen in cb data .",

    "the mass quoted by etkin et al .",
    "@xcite is the k - matrix mass , and can differ from the t - matrix mass ; the k - matrix formalism assumes that all decay channels are known , but that is unlikely .",
    "the obvious interpretation of the @xmath215 is the @xmath43 partner of @xmath207 , i.e. a @xmath39 state .",
    "etkin et al .",
    "also report an @xmath218 in the @xmath219 s - wave and @xmath220 in the @xmath219 d - wave .",

    "the mab @xmath222 trajectory uses @xmath223 .",
    "that entry in pdg tables has a straightforward interpretation . the @xmath224 channel ( and therefore @xmath102 ) couples strongly to @xmath10 .",
    "when analysing data on dalitz plots , it is necessary to continue the flatt ' e formula for @xmath10 below the @xmath11 threshold , rather than just cutting it off .",
    "this is the way in which crystal barrel analyses dalitz plots .",
    "the result is a cusp in the @xmath179 channel at 1430 mev , see fig .",
    "7 of adomeit et al .",
    "it is likely that the data listed by the pdg under @xmath225 were due to this phenomenon .",
    "the mab @xmath226 trajectory uses @xmath71 , which is a well known @xmath43 state and is obviously invalid .",

    "the rapidly rising @xmath11 phase space shifts the peak in @xmath11 up to 1640 mev @xcite .",
    "the second is based on the questionable @xmath176 and @xmath231 , which is a very narrow peak , 23 mev wide , claimed in bes ii data .",
    "if such a narrow state contributes to non - strange @xmath3 states , it is a mystery why it is not observed very conspicuously in cb data .",
    "their final trajectory is made of @xmath232 and @xmath220 , which are observed in @xmath219 and @xmath101 and finds a slope of @xmath233 gev@xmath1 ; they are obvious candidates for @xmath43 states .",
    "section 3d of mab @xcite concerns @xmath234 and @xmath235 trajectories .",
    "these agree with cb . the @xmath236 is usually considered as a hybrid candidate ; it has little effect on the fitted slope .",
    "section c discusses @xmath237 and @xmath238 states .",
    "their slope for the latter is close to the cb value but with much larger error from their @xmath4 criterion .",
    "the physics situation concerning @xmath237 states is a mess , for physics reasons .",
    "the @xmath157 couples weakly to @xmath187 and there are large dispersive effects in the @xmath182 channel , which have not yet been taken into account .",
    "the natural interpretation of it is the @xmath20 radial excitation of @xmath239 , but the large slope may arise simply from the fact that the ground state is abnormally low , like the @xmath21 and @xmath166 .",
    "the @xmath240 of babar has a larger error in mass : @xmath241 mev and is marginally consistent with @xmath242 , which actually has a mass of @xmath243 mev .",
    "the @xmath244 can be identified with a recent novosibirsk observation of a @xmath245 peak almost exactly at the @xmath75 threshold @xcite .",
    "this is likely to be a @xmath20 state captured by the very strong @xmath75 s - wave , but could be a non - resonant cusp .",
    "cb data list ratios @xmath246 of coupling constants to orbital angular momentum @xmath247 and @xmath130 .",

    "the @xmath253 in cb data has @xmath254 which is ambiguous .",
    "however , the @xmath255 make a natural sequence of @xmath27 , @xmath20 , @xmath27 . if this solution to the puzzle is accepted , the slope of the cb @xmath20 trajectory is @xmath256 , with a rather poor fit to the mass of @xmath242 . in view of the problems with @xmath242 ,",
    "this is not included in the grand average .",
    "the trajectory of @xmath257 , @xmath248 and @xmath253 gives a slope of @xmath258 ; mab quote @xmath259 .",
    "section 3b of mab @xcite discusses @xmath79 and @xmath260 states .",
    "the @xmath261 is believed to be a goldstone boson and should not be included in the assessement of @xmath3 states .",
    "the @xmath262 and @xmath263 were claimed by dm2 , but later identified in mark iii data @xcite as having @xmath264 , though they sit on a large non - interfering @xmath265 background ; [ @xmath266 and @xmath265 do not interfere in @xmath21 radiative decays after summing over relevant spin states of the @xmath21 ] .",
    "they are also identified in e760 data @xcite in the @xmath52 channel , where @xmath268 is forbidden by bose statistics . the remaining trajectory",
    ", @xmath269 and @xmath60 gives a cb slope of @xmath270 ; mab quote @xmath271 .    for @xmath260 states",
    ", the averaged slope agrees with the global average within errors but the @xmath4 of the fit to the @xmath272 in the middle is high .",
    "there is a likely explanation .",
    "there is an extra state @xmath273 which is naturally explained as a hybrid partner to @xmath274 predicted near this mass . by the usual level repulsion , this pushes the @xmath275 down and the @xmath272 up , though the overall effect on the average slope is small .    section 3a of mab @xcite discusses the @xmath276 trajectory .",
    "the @xmath277 has a large error in mass of @xmath278 mev .",
    "the @xmath279 completes the trajectory .",
    "there is an obvious problem that the @xmath280 has a large width ; the pdg quotes it as 250660 mev .",
    "a recent babar estimate is @xmath281 mev .",
    "the cb slope is @xmath282 gev@xmath1 ; mab find @xmath283 gev@xmath1 .    finally , mab discard all slope determinations which have only two points .",
    "this removes all the determinations from @xmath40 , @xmath284 and @xmath285 states which are amongst the best .",
    "as one sees from table 1 and fig .",
    "1 , these determinations have slopes consistent with other cb values .",
    "mab also assign @xmath203 and @xmath204 the radial quantum numbers @xmath167 and 3 , while the nearby @xmath228 and @xmath286 obviously have @xmath287 and 4 .    in summary ,",
    "the mab classification of slopes unfortunately contains a number of problems , and there is no significant case for the large slopes they claim for some cases .",
    "values of cb and mab differ significantly only where there are clear problems in their selection of states in the fit .",
    "the weighted mean of cb slopes is revised slightly . on close inspection ,",
    "the @xmath4 contributions from @xmath288 results are high by a factor 4 .",
    "warnings about the problem in this case have already been given .",
    "likewise contributions to @xmath4 from @xmath198 are high by a factor 5 . again the text has pointed out problems for these states . finally , @xmath289 contributions from @xmath117 @xmath39 states are high by a factor 4 .",
    "this is no surprise , since there are no polarisation data to provide clear identifications of these states .",
    "mab remark that anisovich , anisovich and sarantsev ( aas ) proposed a scheme in the year 2000 where the lowest @xmath25 states were taken as @xmath99 and @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "since then , there have been many studies of the effects of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "it is now widely believed that the @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are meson - meson states , and that there is a crossover to @xmath3 states near 1 gev , where chiral symmetry breaking decreases rapidly .",
    "summarising , the mean slope without any corrections is @xmath290 . reducing the weights of the three troublesome cases to 1 modifies this to the final value @xmath291 , compared with the old value of @xmath2 gev@xmath1 .",
    "there is no clear case for the large error assessment of mab .",
    "in fact , states with large widths already enlarge the errors for masses appropriately .",
    "a comment on the mab approach is that they adopt their assumption that meson masses can move by @xmath292 from theoretical predictions ; those are that for large-@xmath293 the strong coupling constant scales as @xmath294 with the result that meson masses change by @xmath292 when evolved from @xmath295 to @xmath296 , see the references 16 - 18 given in their paper .",
    "the conclusion from the present analysis is that the @xmath293 world is different from @xmath297 .",
    "the pdg lists cb data under ` other light mesons , further states ' on the grounds that they need confirmation . perhaps , but @xmath36 , @xmath37 does contains a complete spectrum of expected states . for other isospin and @xmath298 values",
    ", it is desirable to improve the data base .",
    "that can not be done in production experiments , because the exchanged meson is not usually known , i.e. no polarisation information is available .",
    "the @xmath119 and @xmath30 states can be improved at vepp 2 in novosibirsk by using transversely polarised electrons .",
    "two measurements are readily made of asymmetries normal to the plane of polarisation and in the plane of polarisation .",
    "electron polarisation of @xmath299 is already achieved and two detectors cmd and smd are available and running .",
    "the presence of @xmath27 states is then revealed by distinctive azimuthal angular dependence in the polarisation and can measure whether these are pure @xmath27 states or linear combinations with @xmath20 , and if so how big the contributions are .",
    "longitudinal polarisation does not help much because it depends only on the difference of intensities of the two helicities available .    in order to trace the missing states above 1910 mev ,",
    "polarisation measurements are needed for @xmath38 @xmath37 ( @xmath300 , @xmath301 and @xmath302 ) , @xmath38 , @xmath62 ( @xmath303 and @xmath304 ) , and @xmath36 , @xmath305 ( @xmath64 and @xmath306 ) .",
    "polarisation data also introduce interference between singlet and triplet states , hence determining the singlet states much better .",
    "data are required down to @xmath126 momenta of @xmath307 mev / c , the lowest momentum reached in the ps172 experiment @xcite .",
    "the panda experiment can not do this measurement because their lowest available beam momentum will be 1.5 gev / c .",
