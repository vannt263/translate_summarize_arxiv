    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "the current chapter outlines the general idea and the setting of the strategy as well as the motivation behind the underlying research .",
    "chapter 2 describes the direct intuitive scheme for the optimization of the key parameters of the strategy from historical data , quotes the results of the strategy s returns and poses questions for the further analysis .",
    "chapter 3 highlights the main analytical point of this work - explicit formula for the distribution of the running maximum of the ou process stopped at maximum drawdown , and discusses how it relates to the strategy and which characteristics of the strategy s returns can be derived from the running maximum distribution .",
    "chapter 4 overviews the parameters estimation methods for ou process and refers to the results of the estimation on the basis of the historical data that we use for testing the strategy s efficiency .",
    "chapter 5 summarizes the correspondence between the actual results and analytical estimates , and provides the outlook on the further optimization .",
    "* general idea of the strategy *    as mentioned , the proposed methodology relies on the assumption that processes reflecting the dynamics of currency exchange rates are in a certain sense similar to the class of ou processes and exhibit the mean reverting property .    in other words ,",
    "as such process deviates from its current mean , a certain `` force '' tends to revert it back to its mean value .",
    "this property can be exploited in the context of forex markets dynamics : due to occasional sparks of increased volatility usually caused by economic factors , the exchange rate may burst out creating a potential force that tends to drive the process back to its mean trend level . opening a long or short position , contrary to the direction of the outburst ,",
    "may allow to take advantage of this driving force .",
    "observations of the weekly eur / usd dynamics confirm that the profile indicating the configuration `` outburst followed by a movement in the opposite direction '' ( in technical terms usually interpreted as correction or consolidation ) is frequently observed and agrees with the above described intuition .    the strategy that relies on the above observation",
    "can loosely be outlined as follows :    * at the start of each week of trading , set up an exchange rate level that can serve as `` zero - level '' ( usually , weekend rate or the opening of the week rate ) and pre - set the triggers for position opening ( described next ) . * the position will open if the rate rises above a predetermined level u ( short position opening ) or drops below the level d ( long position opening ) , where u and d are measured from the \" zero - level. the position opens automatically depending on which of the levels , @xmath0 or @xmath1 , is hit first . * as soon as the position is opened , the trailing stop ( ts ) and the profit call ( cp ) levels are affiliated with the position so that it will close automatically as soon as either of these stops work out ( or it will close at the weekly trading closure if none of them is hit ) .",
    "to summarize , the above strategy is simply designed to take advantage of the correction that often follows the initial outburst , usually near the start of the trading week  and therefore use the driving force that reverts the process back to its long - term mean , in favour of the trader .    of course , it is possible that the initial price movement that triggers the opening of the position is actually a reflection of the trend rather than an `` outburst '' , so that the opened position would in fact be held against the trend and would therefore be a potential loss .",
    "however , long history of observations on eur / usd trading pair show that configurations with drawdown / drawup following the outburst up / down are observed within almost each of the trading weeks , while the pure - trend configuration is a relatively rare situation .",
    "the above argument is nevertheless purely intuitive and we will , of course , need a more solid probabilistic and statistical reasoning to justify the potential profitability of the strategy .",
    "we address the probability context of the model in the following chapters , where we will consider the analytical representation of the distribution of the return of the strategy as well as the estimation of parameters of the underlying process , under the hypothesis that this process is of an ou type .    taking another look at the idea of the strategy and its implementation",
    ", we note that the key problem in this context is the task of optimizing the parameters u , d , ts , cp .",
    "we will be looking for such a set ( u , d , ts , cp ) that would produce the maximum aggregated profit for the strategy .",
    "before proceeding to analytical study in the following chapters , we start with a straightforward scheme of the strategy implementation , as the practical results are likely to highlight the strategy s potential and indicate the points of the further analysis .    at first instance",
    ", we estimate the parameters in a simplistic way , via the `` ad hoc '' rule : assuming that the historical data that is constantly revealed , can be used for optimization of the parameters @xmath2 directly by maximizing the `` what if '' returns of the strategy over the past years , the scheme can roughly be described as :    * at the start of year @xmath3 , use the available data up to and including year @xmath4 to estimate the set @xmath2 of parameters such that the aggregate return over the past period ( say , over year @xmath4 only if no earlier data is available ) would be largest possible . * implementing the strategy during the year @xmath3 , use the set @xmath2 of parameters estimated at the previous step .",
    "* by the start of year @xmath5 , use the actual result of the strategy s return over the year @xmath3 , and in addition use the data of the year @xmath3 that is now available along with previous history , to simulate possible returns with other choices of parameters and therefore to perform the `` what if '' analysis and obtain the updated estimate of the set @xmath2 of parameters such that the aggregate return over the year @xmath3 would be largest possible ( or , alternatively , the aggregate return over year @xmath4 * and * year @xmath3 together would have been largest ) . * at the start of each following year @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , repeat the above updating scheme , using different selective data sets ( using data of previous year , @xmath8 , only , or using two or more years of history that has been revealed by the year @xmath6 ) .    in relation to this scheme ,",
    "note that the parameters updating can , of course , be performed on a more frequent than yearly basis .    at first instance of the strategy implementation",
    ", the optimization of the parameters set was performed approximately ( without using automated optimization techniques which would be appropriate is this case but would also appear computationally expensive considering the set of @xmath9 , possibly cross - dependent , parameters ) .",
    "this approximate scheme allowed to draft first conclusions about preferable ways of parameters updating .",
    "figure 1 indicates the histogram of the weekly returns as a result of the implementation of the strategy with parameters optimization of the basis of @xmath10 recent year data only , using the historical data of eur / usd over @xmath11 years from @xmath12 to the middle of @xmath13 .     to the mid of @xmath13 ( around @xmath14 weeks ) ) [ f1],width=264 ]    we quote the results of different scheme s implementation in table 1 below , which is structured as follows : the lines with the year number followed by `` e '' , such as @xmath12e etc , indicate the results of _ estimation _ , so that the corresponding year s data were used to optimize the parameters to obtain the largest possible value of the mean weekly returns @xmath15 .",
    "the lines with the year number followed by `` * a * '' , on the other hand , indicate the `` actual '' results , so that if the parameters estimated from previous years were used during the current year , it would result in the _ actual _ mean weekly returns value as indicated .",
    "note that weekly mean , @xmath15 , is expressed in euros .",
    "it is calculated under the assumption that each single position is @xmath16 euro with leverage @xmath17 , and the commission for holding the asset overnight is @xmath18 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     table 3 . relative number of actual profit calls vs. theoretical values    again , the pc estimate that comes from the scheme of parameters updating that uses all the history available by the corresponding week , is much closer to the observed relative number of the actual profit calls , with respective variances ( of the corresponding poisson binomial r.v.s ) also in good agreement .",
    "we acknowledge and appreciate the collaboration with the research and development team of quantum brains capital who provided feedback that allowed for useful and motivating discussions ."
