    "in recent years , analogies have taken on a major role in physics and mathematics @xcite .",
    "they provide the new ways of looking at problems that permit cross - fertilization of ideas among different branches of science .",
    "analogy methods have practical worth from two point of views : first , they provide new light on perplexing theoretical questions @xcite .",
    "second , some of them are interesting for experimental set - up @xcite .",
    "+ in this contribution we use the method developed in @xcite , in a multilayer stack to show how we can set up an experimental model for special relativity and rindler space as a special case of general relativity .",
    "+ in the present section we review some of the relevant results achieved in @xcite . as it is well known , @xmath0 group is locally isomorphic ( or a 2 to 1 homomorphic ) to lorentz group , @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , the transfer matrix , used in the classical optics for description of the interaction of light and matter , can be considered as an element of @xmath2 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite , authors gave a geometrical interpretation for the transfer matrix of an absorbing system .",
    "in fact , they considered an isolated absorbing film embedded between two identical ambient @xmath3 and substrate @xmath4 media .",
    "a monochromatic , linear polarized plane wave falls from the ambient , as well as a plane wave of the same frequency and polarization falls from the substrate .",
    "if the amplitudes of the field are characterized by a column vector , @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is denoted backward ( forward)-travelling plane wave , and the amplitudes of the ambient and substrate are related by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the transfer matrix and is defined as , @xmath10 and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the transmission and reflection coefficients , respectively . + by defining the coherency matrix @xcite as @xmath13 for both @xmath3 and @xmath4 , it is easy to show that , @xmath14 it is useful to identify the variables @xmath15 , @xmath16 as the coordinates of a @xmath17-dimensional minkowski space , in which @xmath18 ( the identity ) and @xmath19 s are the standard pauli matrices .",
    "the conjugation ( [ 0.4 ] ) induces a transformation on the variables @xmath20 of the form @xmath21 where , @xmath22 it is easy to see that the transformation @xmath23 is a lorentz transformation @xcite which is generated by @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "thus it is a @xmath26 homomorphism map between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "+ we use the model which is developed in @xcite , and consider a monochromatic , linearly polarized plane electromagnetic wave incident on a non - absorption multilayer thin film . in this model basis",
    "coordinates are defined by the components of the electromagnetic wave , i.e. , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "+ the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we review the transfer matrix method for description of the multilayer films . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we introduce spinor map between @xmath31 and @xmath28 , and we draw analogy between an em field which passes through a multilayer film and transformation of coordinates under the lorentzian group . in addition",
    ", two special cases , a multilayer , that is , quarter - wave films and a multilayer with very low thickness films , are studied in detail . in section [ s4 ] , by using the multilayer films , we suggest an experimental set - up for investigation of two kinematical properties , that is , time delay and length contraction as some of predictions of the special relativity . in section [ s5 ]",
    "we introduce an analogy between the rindler space , as a curved space , and a suitable multilayer film .",
    "finally , a summary and conclusion remarks are given in section [ s6 ] .",
    "we consider an electromagnetic radiation falling onto a structure consisting of a thin film with uniform thickness @xmath32 and index of refraction @xmath33 .",
    "this isolated ( homogeneous and isotropic ) film , is embedded between two media , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with indexes of refraction , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "we consider a monochromatic , linearly polarized plane falling wave which is injected into the thin film from the above with amplitude @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the field after passing the end layer is characterized by @xmath38 and @xmath39 , as it is shown in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we use transfer matrix method which is a method used in optics to analyse the propagation of electromagnetic through a stratified ( layered ) medium @xcite . + the transfer - matrix method is based on the fact that , according to maxwell s equations , there are simple continuity conditions for tangential component of electric field and normal component of magnetic field across boundaries .    in addition , this method can be developed to the multilayer films . @xcite . for a stack with @xmath40 layers ,",
    "the transfer - matrix can be defined as a product of matrices given by @xmath41 where the transfer - matrix of the @xmath42 layer , @xmath43 , is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47-polarization and @xmath48-polarization is characterized by @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the angle @xmath51 is related to the angle of incidence @xmath52 by snell s law , that is , @xmath53",
    "in this section , we use the spinor map , from @xmath31 , onto the lorentz group , @xmath1 .",
    "we define a coherence matrix @xcite as follows : @xmath54 for both @xmath3 and @xmath4 , so that @xmath55 and @xmath56 are related acording to the eq .",
    "( [ 0.4 ] ) .",
    "we explicitly define the coordinates @xmath15 , by using equation ( [ 0.5 ] ) , @xmath57 it is worth to note that these coordinates behave as a light - like interval : @xmath58 therefore , the conjugation relation ( [ 0.4 ] ) induces a transformation on the variables @xmath20 in the form of equation ( [ 2.5 ] ) .",
    "+ however , we can decompose the transfer matrix of a thin film , according to equations ( [ 1.3 ] ) and ( [ 12.1 ] ) with @xmath59 , as @xmath60 thus , under the homomorphism ( [ 2.6 ] ) , @xmath61 generates a boost of velocity @xmath62 ( in natural units , where @xmath63 ) , while @xmath64 induces a pure spatial rotation . + to gain physical insights ,",
    "we write explicitly the equation ( [ 2.6 ] ) for @xmath65 and @xmath66 . under the homomorphism ( [ 2.6 ] ) , @xmath67 generates the following matrix @xmath68 which is a rotation in the plane @xmath69 of angle twice the phase of the transmission coefficient .",
    "+ furthermore , diagonal matrix @xmath61 , under the homomorphism ( [ 2.6 ] ) , generates a boost in the plane @xmath70 @xcite , @xmath71 where rapidity @xmath72 is obtained from the relations @xmath73 and velocity @xmath74 is defined by @xmath75 in figure ( [ fig3 ] ) , we have plotted the variation of @xmath74 with respect to the @xmath76 for different values of the index of refraction , @xmath33 , when the electromagnetic field have @xmath47- , and @xmath48-polarization .",
    "it is seen that for every values of the index of refraction , @xmath77 has maximum or minimum in @xmath78 .",
    "in addition , for a fixed @xmath79 , the @xmath74 is increased by increasing the refraction index , for both @xmath47- , and @xmath80-polarization .",
    "however , for the large values of the refraction index , @xmath81 , for both polarization , the result is the same , as shown in figure ( [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "finally , by using equations ( [ 2.7 ] ) , ( [ 2.8 ] ) and ( [ 2.9 ] ) we obtain @xmath82 as @xmath83 where @xmath84 . also , with some calculations , we can rewrite equation ( [ 2.10.1 ] ) , in the following form @xcite .",
    "@xmath85 in addition , by using einstein rule for the composition of velocities @xcite , @xmath86 we can write @xmath82 as a rotation and a boost , @xmath87 where @xmath88,{\\nonumber}\\\\ \\beta_{3}^{\\prime}&=&-\\frac{\\beta } { 1-\\beta^{2}\\cos(2\\omega t ) }   \\big ( \\cos(2\\omega t)+\\frac{\\beta^{2}\\sin^{2}(2\\omega t ) } { 1+\\sqrt{1-\\beta^{2}}}\\big).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in figures ( [ fig5 ] ) and ( [ fig6 ] ) , we have plotted the variations of @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 with respect to @xmath32 for @xmath92 and @xmath93 , for @xmath94-polarization and @xmath48-polarization , respectively .",
    "as it is seen , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and latexmath:[$    we now turn to the multi - layer stack with @xmath40 films . by employing the method which is used to obtain equation ( [ 2.100.2 ] ) , and by using equation ( [ 2.200 ] )",
    ", we can write @xmath98 as @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 with @xmath102 and @xmath103,\\\\ \\beta_{3}^{(i)}&=&-\\frac{\\beta^{(i ) } } { 1-(\\beta^{(i)})^{2}\\cos(2\\omega^{(i ) } t^{(i ) } ) } \\big ( \\cos(2\\omega^{(i ) } t^{(i)})+\\frac{(\\beta^{(i)})^{2}\\sin^{2}(2\\omega^{(i ) } t^{(i)})}{1+\\sqrt{1-(\\beta^{(i)})^{2}}}\\big).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] also , by using einstein addition rule ( [ 3.2 ] ) , we can rewrite equation ( [ 3.3 ] ) as @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are given by applying the rule ( [ 3.2 ] ) consecutively .",
    "+      in this section , we consider a multilayer with quarter - wave films @xcite , that is @xmath107 and assume that @xmath108 , so that @xmath109 and @xmath110 . as an example , for a stack consists of two layers , matrix @xmath111 , is given by , @xmath112 which under the homomorphism ( [ 2.6 ] ) , generates a boost as @xcite , @xmath113 where velocity @xmath114 is given by @xmath115 and rapidity @xmath116 is obtained from the relations @xmath117 in general , for a stack consists of @xmath118 quarter - wave layers , in which the thickness of @xmath119 layer is @xmath120 , after some simple calculation , we can achieve @xmath121 as , @xmath122 where velocity @xmath123 is calculated by the rule ( [ 3.2 ] ) . as an example for @xmath124",
    ", we have @xmath125      in this section we study a multilayer , with @xmath40 layers , in such a way that @xmath126 s are near to the unit , @xmath127 .",
    "thus , by using equation ( [ 2.11 ] ) and keeping only first - order term of @xmath126 , we obtain @xmath128 and therefore the lorentzian transformations are replaced by the galilean transformations .",
    "thus , by these assumption , we can rewrite the equation ( [ 3.7 ] ) as the following relation : @xmath129 where @xmath130,{\\nonumber}\\\\   \\mathcal{b}_{3}^{(\\mathcal{m})}&=&\\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\beta^{(i)}\\cos[2(\\omega^ { ( i)}+\\omega^{(i ) } ) t^{(i)}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in addition , when we assume @xmath32 is very thin , from equation ( [ 2.10.1 ] ) , by keeping only first - order terms in @xmath32 , the rotation @xmath131 appears as a pure boost , @xmath132 , which is followed by another pure boost in another direction , @xmath133 , so that the result is like a thomas precession .",
    "that is , we can write @xcite , @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 is the acceleration along the second axis , @xmath137 .",
    "we can now propose some specific experiments bases on the properties discussed in the preceding sections .",
    "the basic experimental set - up consists essentially of a monochromatic plane wave , linear polarized ( @xmath94 or @xmath48 ) with the specific values of @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "+ we use a stack consists of @xmath140 quarter - wave layers . according to the equation ( [ 20.9 ] ) , the coordinates @xmath141 and @xmath142 under the action of transformation matrix remain invariant .",
    "therefore , it is possible to consider @xmath143 as a boost which belongs to @xmath144 : @xmath145 to show how the experimental set - up works , let us suppose that the electromagnetic fields , @xmath146 and @xmath147 , fall onto the multi - layer . from equation ( [ 2.4 ] ) we have @xmath148 and @xmath149 these equations clearly show that there are many possible experimental methods to choose the input fields in such a way that two different points in a reference frame may be appear in the other frame as either with the same temporal or same spatial coordinate .",
    "+ we consider two experimental set - ups with different inputs @xmath150 and @xmath151 and corresponding to outputs @xmath152 and @xmath153 , where @xmath154 .",
    "thus , it is easy to show that @xmath155 when @xmath156 and @xmath157 when @xmath158 by using equation ( [ 5.4 ] ) , the first set - up can be used to demonstrate the length contraction , @xmath159 in order to put forward the phenomenon of the time dilation , let us consider another experimental set - up in which @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 satisfy the equation ( [ 5.5 ] ) .",
    "therefore , measurement of @xmath164 may be regarded as a time interval measurement .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath165 in summary , we have proposed a series of specific experiments by using a multilayer , which contains two films and the thickness of their films are given by @xmath166 , that clearly demonstrate the most important predictions of the lorentz kinematics .",
    "maxwell s equations in general coordinates are written as @xcite @xmath167 and @xmath168 e_{k , j}=\\dfrac{\\partial ( \\sqrt{g}{\\hspace{0.04 cm}}g^{ij}b_{j})}{\\partial t},\\hspace{.5 cm }   \\left [ ijk \\right ] h_{k , j}=\\frac{1}{c^{2}}\\dfrac{\\partial ( \\sqrt{g}{\\hspace{0.04 cm}}g^{ij}e_{j})}{\\partial t}+\\mu_{0}\\sqrt{g}{\\hspace{0.04 cm}}j^{i},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where permutation symbol , @xmath169 $ ] , is defined by @xmath170=\\bigg\\lbrace \\begin{array}{ccc } + 1 , & \\text{if}\\ ijk \\hspace{.1 cm } $ is an even permutation of $ 123,\\\\ -1 , & \\text{if}\\ ijk \\hspace{.1cm}$ is an odd permutation of $ 123,\\\\   0 , & $ otherwise$.   \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the einstein summation convention is used .",
    "as it is well known in optics , the maxwell s equations in empty - curved space can be replaced by maxwell s equations in the flat space which is filled by dielectric media with the following parameters @xcite , @xmath171 therefore , we can see a correspondence between geometry and matter , as in the general relativity .",
    "thus , in this case , the index of refraction is obtained by @xcite @xmath172 now , if we consider the metric , @xmath173 by using equations ( [ 2.24 ] ) and ( [ 2.267 ] ) , the index of refraction is given by @xmath174^{-1 } $ ] .",
    "+ on the other hand , the principle of equivalence make the gravitational field connect to the acceleration .",
    "therefore , to study gravitational effects , we can generalize concept of lorentz transformations so as to include observers who are moving with a constant acceleration with respect to an inertial frame .",
    "this metric is called rindler metric and described as @xcite , @xmath175 it is easy to see that the metrics ( [ 2.22 ] ) and ( [ 2.25 ] ) are conformal . accordingly , by using the equation ( [ 2.267 ] ) , we obtain the refractive index of the analogue media with the rindler space as the following relation : @xmath176 thus , for analogue rindler space we assume a multilayer , for which the refractive index of the @xmath119 layer is characterized by , @xmath177 however , up to the first order approximation in @xmath178 and by using equation ( [ 4.5 ] ) , for @xmath94- and @xmath80-polarization , when @xmath179 , we can rewrite equation ( [ 4.1 ] ) as , @xmath180 where @xmath181 and @xmath182 also , we can consider a stack consists of the quarter - wavelength layers , i.e. , @xmath183 . therefore , by using the equation ( [ 2.26 ] ) , the thickness of @xmath119 layer is @xmath184 after some calculation , we can obtain thickness of the @xmath185 layer as , @xmath186 and the index of refraction of this layer is obtained by @xmath187 we can now construct an analogy between the rindler space and a multilayer with @xmath118 quarter - wavelength layers , in which the thickness of @xmath42 layer is given by equation ( [ 4.101 ] ) and its refraction index is given by equation ( [ 4.102 ] ) .",
    "accordingly we obtain , @xmath188 in refs .",
    "@xcite , electrodynamics in the rindler space had been studied by using a phenomenological approach .",
    "accordingly , the component of the electric field , near the horizon , @xmath189 , reads as follow : @xmath190 where @xmath191 is the modified bessel function of order @xmath192 .",
    "+ figure ( [ fig18 ] ) displays a comparison between the output values of the electric fields are given by equation ( [ multilyer ] ) and equation ( [ rin ] ) , i.e. , @xmath193 in terms of @xmath194 and for different values of @xmath195 . as it is seen , by increasing @xmath196 ( increasing the number of layers ) , @xmath197 approaches to zero .",
    "in addition , @xmath197 is decreased more rapidly by decreasing the @xmath195 .",
    "this paper is an example of analogue models of einstein relativity .",
    "firstly , we have used a geometrical tool to analyze a multilayer film in a concise way that is closely related to the special relativity .",
    "then , this method was made an analogy between multilayer stack and curved space in the general relativity .",
    "in fact , in the first step , we have seen how the transfer matrix can be interpreted as multiplication of a boost , a rotation and another boost . + in addition , in this case , we have suggested an experimental set - up which tests the most important predictions of the lorentz kinematics , i.e. , time delay and length contraction .",
    "however , by using this isomorphism , apart from a relativistic presentation of the topic , which has interest in its own , we suggested an experimental set - up which is , in theoretical view , so simple and understandable , and , in practical level , was so easy to accomplish , in contrast to the similar experimental set - up @xcite .",
    "+ finally , we have employed analogue method in replacing maxwell s equations in empty - curved space to maxwell s equations in the flat space where the later is filled by a media .",
    "then , we have applied this method to the rindler frame , which by using principle of equivalence , is locally equivalent to gravitational fields .",
    "this means that this method makes an analogy between accelerated frame in general relativity and a suitable multilayer films , with specific values of the refractive indexes and thickness of the films .",
