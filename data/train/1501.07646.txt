    "the fractional fourier transform is becoming increasingly more important due to an ever - growing list of applications in signal processing , optics and quantum mechanics and in other areas of science @xcite . in order to define this object",
    "one needs first to diagonalize the fourier transform operator @xmath0 , and that is where hermite functions @xmath1 become indispensable .",
    "it is well - known that hermite functions are the eigenfunctions of the fourier transform operator @xmath2 and that they form a complete orthonormal basis of @xmath3 . in other words ,",
    "the orthogonal basis of hermite functions diagonalizes the fourier transform operator @xmath0 and this allows us to define the fractional power @xmath4  the fractional fourier transform .",
    "of course , there are infinitely many ways to choose an eigenbasis of the fourier transform , each of them would lead to a different version of the fractional fourier transform .",
    "what makes hermite functions",
    "so special among all other eigenfunctions is that they are analytically tractable and they have many useful properties .",
    "this analytical tractability and mehler s formula @xcite ( which gives an explicit expression for the integral kernel of the fractional fourier transform ) have sealed the standing of hermite functions as the canonical set of the eigenfunctions for fourier transform .",
    ".dimensions of the eigenspaces @xmath5 of the discrete fourier transform @xmath6 , corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath7 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     compared to the continuous fourier transform , the situation with the eigenvectors of the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) is much more complex .",
    "let us first introduce several necessary definitions and notations .",
    "the ( centered ) discrete fourier transform @xmath6 is a linear map that sends a vector @xmath8 into a vector @xmath9 according to the rule @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the set of integers @xmath12 everywhere in this paper we will follow the convention that all vectors will be denoted by bold lower case letters and the elements of a vector will be labeled by the set @xmath11 .",
    "before we begin discussing the eigenvectors of the dft , let us say a few words about its eigenvalues .",
    "the eigenvalues of both continuous and discrete fourier transform are given by @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "in the continuous case each eigenspace is infinite dimensional , whereas the multiplicities of eigenvalues in the discrete case are presented in the table [ tab_multiplicities ] .",
    "this result was obtained in 1921 by schur , however it can be easily derived from a much earlier result of gauss on the law of quadratic reciprocity , which is essentially a statement about the trace of the matrix corresponding to the linear transformation @xmath6 .",
    "the formula for the multiplicities of eigenvalues was rediscovered by mcclellan and parks @xcite in 1972 , and since then there have appeared many other proofs ( see @xcite for a very simple proof based on the vandermonde determinant formula ) .",
    "returning to our discussion of eigenvectors of the dft , it seems that the first example of an eigenbasis was constructed by mcclellan and parks @xcite as a by - product of their proof of the results in table [ tab_multiplicities ] .",
    "other constructions of eigenvectors of the dft include a number - theoretic construction @xcite and a representation theory approach @xcite .",
    "mehta @xcite has constructed an eigenbasis based on theta functions .",
    "one important approach for finding orthogonal eigenvectors of the dft is based on certain symmetric tridiagonal ( or almost tridiagonal ) matrices which commute with the dft .",
    "the eigenvectors of these matrices give an orthogonal eigenbasis of the dft .",
    "such matrices were first discovered by dickinson and steiglitz @xcite and by grunbaum @xcite ( see also @xcite for more recent developments ) .",
    "the above discussion clearly shows that there is an abundance of different sets of eigenvectors of the dft .",
    "how can we choose  the best \" among them ?",
    "first we need to define what we mean by  the best \" .",
    "an ideal set of eigenvectors of the discrete fourier transform @xmath6 should satisfy the following three requirements : the eigenvectors should be orthogonal , they should converge to the corresponding hermite functions as @xmath15 and they should have at least some degree of analytical tractability ( so that we are able to compute them ) . judging by these standards , most of the above candidates can be disqualified . for example , the eigenbasis of mcclellan and parks is explicit but not orthogonal and it does not approximate hermite functions ; the eigenbasis of mehta @xcite does approximate hermite functions but it is not orthogonal ; the eigenbasis constructed in @xcite is orthogonal , but it requires @xmath16 to be a certain prime number and it does not seem to approximate hermite functions .",
    "in fact , the only sets of eigenvectors that do satisfy the above requirements come from the commuting symmetric matrix approach of dickinson and steiglitz @xcite and grunbaum @xcite , though in both cases the eigenvectors are not given explicitly and to find them one needs to diagonalize a tridiagonal symmetric matrix .    not much is known about _",
    "explicit _ hermite - type eigenvectors of the dft .",
    "in fact , it seems that the only result in this direction comes from the recent paper by kong @xcite , who gives two examples of such eigenvectors .",
    "more precisely , when @xmath17 the vector @xmath18 with @xmath19 is an eigenvector of @xmath6 , and the same is true when @xmath20 for the vector @xmath21 with @xmath22 numerical evidence given in @xcite suggests that these two vectors approximate the first two hermite functions .",
    "what is also interesting about these two eigenvectors is that they are unique in a certain sense .",
    "it follows from the proof of the main result in @xcite ( though it is not explicitly stated there ) that the only eigenvector of the dft of the dimension @xmath17 which has zero elements @xmath23 for @xmath24 is the vector @xmath25 defined in .    in this paper",
    "we provide the first known example of an explicit orthogonal eigenbasis of the dft for which the individual eigenvectors seem to approximate the corresponding hermite functions .",
    "first of all , we construct a basis of @xmath26 which consists of even and odd vectors similar to kong s vectors @xmath25 and @xmath27 given above . these vectors behave nicely under the dft and we prove that they are unique in a certain sense .",
    "the proof of these results uses the methods of kong @xcite combined with the @xmath28-binomial theorem . from this basis of @xmath26",
    "we construct an eigenbasis of the dft following the same procedure as mcclellan and parks @xcite . as a corollary of this construction",
    ", we obtain a new proof of the result on the multiplicities of the eigenvalues of the dft presented in table [ tab_multiplicities ] .",
    "finally , we apply the gramm - schmidt orthogonalization procedure to the basis of each eigenspace of the dft .",
    "this gives us an orthonormal basis of @xmath26 , consisting of the eigenvectors of the discrete fourier transform @xmath6 .",
    "we prove that the first eight eigenvectors converge to the corresponding hermite functions as @xmath15 and we conjecture that this convergence holds true for all eigenvectors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section_results ]",
    "we present our results for the case @xmath29 .",
    "the proofs of these results are collected in section [ section_proofs ] and in the appendix we give the corresponding formulas for all remaining cases @xmath30 .",
    "we begin by stating some definitions and notations that will be used throughout this paper .",

    "we denote by @xmath36 and @xmath37 the floor and the ceiling function . from now on we will drop the subscript @xmath16 in the notation of the discrete fourier transform and will write simply @xmath0 instead of @xmath6  there should be no confusion as the continuous fourier transform will not be used anymore .",

    "( _ odd _ ) if @xmath39 ( respectively @xmath40 ) for all @xmath41 such that @xmath42 .",
    "an equivalent definition can be given as follows : when @xmath43 the even ( odd ) vectors satisfy the condition @xmath44 ( respectively , @xmath45 ) for @xmath46 .",
    "when @xmath47 the even vectors satisfy @xmath44 for @xmath48 ( note that there is no restriction on @xmath49 ) and the the odd vectors satisfy @xmath50 for @xmath48 and @xmath51 .",
    "the following two properties are well known and will be used extensively later : if @xmath18 is an even vector and @xmath52 is an odd vector , then    * @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) is a real even ( respectively , real odd ) vector ; * @xmath55 and @xmath56 ;    the following object will appear frequently in this paper : the sequence @xmath57 is defined by @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "this sequence satisfies @xmath60 property follows at once from the definition while property can be derived by writing the polynomial @xmath61 as a product of @xmath62 linear factors and then taking the limit as @xmath63 .",
    "we denote by @xmath64 _ the support _ of a vector @xmath65 , which is the set of all indices @xmath66 such that @xmath67 .",
