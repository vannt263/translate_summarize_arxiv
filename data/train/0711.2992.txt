    "in this article we shall be concerned with the einstein - gauss - bonnet theory of gravity , whose action is given by the einstein - hilbert term plus the einstein cosmological constant term @xmath7 , and both supplemented with the gauss - bonnet term , quadratic in the curvature .",
    "the action of the theory reads , @xmath8 etc .",
    "have been employed for five - dimensional tensor indices .",
    "@xmath9 is the five - dimensional riemann tensor . ]",
    "@xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 represents the coupling constant of the quadratic term .",
    "the quadratic term is often called the gauss - bonnet term because it is the dimensional extension of the gauss - bonnet topological invariant in four dimensions .    in five dimensions",
    ", the action ( [ the_action ] ) contains all of the non - zero terms of the lovelock series .",
    "it is thus the most general metric torsion - free theory of gravity which leads to conserved equations of motion which are second order in derivatives @xcite .",
    "the perturbation theory about the maximally symmetric vacuum is free of ghosts @xcite which suggests that it could appear as a higher order correction to einstein s theory in the effective action coming from some more fundamental quantum theory .",
    "in fact , the gauss - bonnet term naturally arises as a higher order correction to gravity within string theory . although the fourth - order derivative corrections are known to appear as the next - to - leading - order correction in the type ii strings@xcite , the quadratic corrections are present in both the heterotic and bosonic string theory @xcite . in those cases ,",
    "the coupling of the gauss - bonnet term is given by @xmath13 multiplied by a function of the dilaton , and so corresponding to powers of the string coupling .",
    "the five - dimensional gauss - bonnet term also arises in the calabi - yau compactification of m - theory , where the coupling of the second - order corrections turns out to be given in terms of the khler moduli of the six - dimensional compact manifold @xcite .",
    "the presence of the gauss - bonnet term introduces some exotic features not found in general relativity .",
    "one such feature is related to the problem of causality ; this was treated in ref .",
    "@xcite in the hamiltonian formalism ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for an alternative treatment of the cauchy problem ) .",
    "because of the non - linearity of the theory , the canonical momenta are not linear in the extrinsic curvature ; and there exist quite generically points in the phase space where the hamiltonian turns out to be multiple - valued . in such a situation , there is a breakdown in the deterministic evolution of the metric from the initial data .",
    "this can also be seen explicitly using the junction conditions @xcite .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that there exist vacuum solutions where the extrinsic curvature can jump spontaneously at some spacelike hypersurface in a way that is not predicted by the initial data .",
    "this breakdown in predictability is induced by the presence of terms in the junction conditions which , unlike the israel conditions valid for einstein s theory , contain non - linear contributions coming from the gauss - bonnet term .    on the other hand , the timelike version of such a jump in the extrinsic curvature is also of great interest .",
    "this is realized by the existence of a kind of gravitational solitons in the theory , which resemble a kink solution .",
    "these solitons correspond to spacetimes that contain timelike hypersurfaces where the metric is @xmath0 continuous but where the extrinsic curvature jumps .",
    "although the riemann curvature tensor contains delta - function singularities on the hypersurface , these spacetimes can still be vacuum solutions because of a nontrivial cancelation coming from additional terms in the junction conditions .",
    "some explicit examples have appeared in the literature @xcite , and a spherically symmetric realization of such solutions were studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of pure gauss - bonnet gravitational theory . here , the systematical analysis made in ref .",
    "@xcite will be extended to the more phenomenologically important case where einstein - hilbert term and cosmological constant are included in the gravitational action",
    ". we will show that vacuum shell solutions are indeed found in einstein - gauss - bonnet theory described by the action ( [ the_action ] ) .",
    "so then we will consider the junction conditions for spherical thin shells in einstein - gauss - bonnet theory in the case that the induced stress tensor on the shell vanishes .",
    "then , we will show that geometries associated with two different spherically symmetric spaces can be joined without resorting to the introduction of matter fields as a source .",
    "depending on the orientation of the two spaces , different global structures may arise .",
    "for instance , for one choice of orientation we get vacuum wormholes in five - dimensions .",
    "these wormholes are gravitational solitons that connect two regions with different masses which can be asymptotically either flat , anti de sitter ( ads ) or de sitter ( ds ) depending on the sign of the effective cosmological constant in each region .",
    "other choices of orientation are possible , such as spherical bubbles , inside of which the value of the effective cosmological drastically changes .",
    "all the cases we will study in detail are such that the singular hypersurfaces where the jump in extrinsic curvature is located correspond to a sphere .",
    "we will call themvacuum shells \" .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "we begin section 2 by presenting some preliminary material that will be used in the rest of the paper .",
    "first , we review basic aspects of the spherically symmetric solution of einstein - gauss - bonnet theory : the well known boulware - deser metric @xcite . secondly , we review the junction conditions for this theory .",
    "we discuss both the cases where the junction hypersurface is of timelike and spacelike signature , we describe the different orientations allowed . at the end of the second section we derive the equation that contains all the information about the junction of two spherically symmetric vacuum solutions in the five - dimensional einstein - gauss - bonnet theory . in section 3",
    "we focus our attention on the static case corresponding to the timelike time - independent junctions ; also we study the instantaneous case corresponding to the spacelike analogue .",
    "we explore the space of parameters of the theory for which solutions describing wormhole - like and bubble - like geometries exist .",
    "we see that such vacuum shells can also contain interior regions where naked singularities arise . in section 4",
    "we survey the catalogue of these curious geometries , and we discuss the qualitative aspects of static solutions , emphasizing the most relevant properties . in section 5 we analyze the dynamical solutions .",
    "this includes a discussion of the ( in)stability of the static solutions under perturbations that preserve the symmetry .",
    "also some general results about the behavior of time - dependent solutions are given in propositions [ no minimum ] and [ repulsion ] .",
    "in section 6 we give an exhaustive parametrization of the space of constant radius solutions .",
    "section 7 is devoted to a discussion of the @xmath0 class metrics and the topology of the solutions .",
    "we also discuss there the uniqueness and staticity of the spherically symmetric solutions , concerning the global validity of the birkhoff - type theorems in lovelock gravity . section 8",
    "contains the conclusions .    with respect to the style of presentation",
    ", we have chosen to organize our results in a series of remarks , propositions and theorems in order to highlight key facts , but descriptions such as ` theorem ' should not be taken in the most strict mathematical sense .",
    "first , we will present some introductory material and notation and conventions .",
    "the spherically symmetric solutions of einstein - gauss - bonnet gravitational theory will be reviewed .",
    "then we will discuss the junction conditions in this theory .",
    "then we will show how these junction conditions permit to join two spherically symmetric spaces without resorting to the introduction of matter source .",
    "let us consider the einstein - gauss - bonnet theory .",
    "the field equations associated with the action ( [ the_action ] ) coupled to some matter action take the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the stress tensor , @xmath16 is the einstein tensor and @xmath17 and where the antisymmetrized kronecker delta is defined as @xmath18}$ ] .",
    "we are mainly interested in the static spherically symmetric solution ( without matter ) to einstein - gauss - bonnet theory in five dimensions . in this case , of space - times fibered over ( constant radius ) 3-spheres , the solutions correspond to the analogues of the schwarzschild geometry , and its form was found by d. boulware and s. deser in ref . @xcite .",
    "more generally , the solutions that correspond to fiber bundles over 3-surfaces of constant negative ( or vanishing ) curvature were subsequently studied in ref .",
    "@xcite ( and also ref .",
    "@xcite in a special class of lovelock theories in arbitrary dimension @xcite ) .",
    "let us discuss these solutions here .",
    "first , let us write the ansatz for the metric as follows @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the metric of the constant curvature three - manifold ( of normalized curvature @xmath21 , @xmath22 or @xmath23 )",
    ". from @xmath24 ( the other field equations are equivalent to it ) one obtains @xmath25 this is integrated for @xmath26 to give @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "the case @xmath29 corresponds to the `` exotic branch '' of the boulware - deser metrics which for @xmath30 and @xmath31 gives a `` microscopic '' anti - de sitter or de sitter metric , with @xmath32 .",
    "it is usually argued that this exotic branch turns out to be an unstable vacuum of the theory , containing ghost excitations @xcite . unlike the case",
    "@xmath33 , this branch does not have a well defined @xmath34 limit . as in the case of schwarzschild solution , @xmath35 here is a constant of integration , and is also associated with the mass of the solution .",
    "in fact , when there is an asymptotic region at the infinity of the coordinate @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath37 , the total energy w.r.t .",
    "each constant curvature background is calculated to be @xmath38 so that , in general , we will call @xmath35 the mass parameter or simply the mass of the metric in each branch @xmath39 , by being the total energy w.r.t . the @xmath31 spacetime in _ that branch",
    "_ , can not be directly compared . ] .",
    "the general features of the black holes ( [ ansatz])-([bd_metric ] ) , such as horizons structure , singularities , etc , were studied systematically in ref .",
    "@xcite ; for further details see the appendix .",
    "unlike general relativity , the einstein - gauss - bonnet theory admits massive solutions with no horizon but with a naked singularity at the origin . from ( [ bd_metric ] )",
    "we see that this always happens for the exotic branch @xmath29 , and might also happen for the branch @xmath40 , provided @xmath41 .",
    "a related feature occurs for electrically charged solutions @xcite . among other interesting properties",
    ", it can be seen that charged black holes in einstein - gauss - bonnet theory have a single horizon if the mass reaches a certain critical value .",
    "another substantial difference between the schwarzschild solution and the boulware - deser solution concerns thermodynamics . unlike black holes in general relativity ,",
    "the einstein - gauss - bonnet black holes turn out to be eternal .",
    "the thermal evaporation process leads to eternal remnants due to a change of the sign in the specific heat for sufficiently small black holes .",
    "this and the other unusual phenomena discussed above are ultimately due to the ultraviolet corrections introduced by the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "the discussion about a spherically symmetric solution of a given theory of gravity immediately raises the obvious question about its uniqueness . regarding this",
    ", there is a subtlety that deserves to be pointed out .",
    "the uniqueness of the boulware - deser solution , discussed previously in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see @xcite for a uniqueness result in axi - dilaton gravity with gauss - bonnet term ) , is only valid under certain assumptions .",
    "this was formalized in a theorem proven by r. zegers @xcite , and which also holds for generic lovelock theory in any dimension .",
    "let us state the result as applies for einstein - gauss - bonnet theory in five dimensions :    any solution with spherical ( or planar or hyperbolic ) symmetry in the second - order einstein - gauss - bonnet theory of gravity has to be locally static and given by the boulware - deser solution provided two key conditions are satisfied : i ) the coefficients of the lovelock expansion are generic enough , which means that the exceptional combination @xmath42 is excluded ; ii ) the solution is @xmath43 smooth .    condition _",
    "i ) _ is certainly a necessary assumption .",
    "indeed , the non - uniqueness in the case of @xmath42 , corresponding to the ( a)ds - invariant chern - simons theory , is a well - known result and was explicitly shown in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will see that condition _",
    "ii ) _ is also necessary . in fact , the vacuum shell solutions we will present are @xmath0 spacetimes which are only piecewise of the boulware - deser form .    in order to analyze @xmath0 solutions , we will need to use the junction conditions in the theory , which will now be discussed .",
    "the next ingredient in our discussion is the junction conditions in einstein - gauss - bonnet theory .",
    "these are the analogues of the israel conditions  @xcite in general relativity , and were worked out in refs .  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the junction conditions will be employed to join two different spherically symmetric spaces .",
    "we will organize the discussion as follows : first , we will discuss the timelike junction condition ; namely , the case where the surgery is performed on a timelike hypersurface , which we shall call a timelike shell . after studying this",
    "we will briefly discuss its spacelike analogue .",
    "let @xmath44 be a timelike hypersurface separating two bulk regions of spacetime , region @xmath45 and region @xmath46 (  left \" and  right \" ) .",
    "conveniently , we introduce the coordinates ( @xmath47 ) and ( @xmath48 ) and the metrics @xmath49 @xmath50 in the respective regions .",
    "we shall be interested in the case where the bulk regions are empty of matter so @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the boulware - deser metric functions given by equation ( [ bd_metric ] ) . in general , the mass parameter @xmath53 will be different from @xmath54 .",
    "moreover , we will also consider the possibility of having @xmath55 different from @xmath56 , so that the two different branches of the boulware - deser solution can be considered to the two spaces to be joined .",
    "it is convenient to parameterize the shell s motion in the @xmath57 plane using the proper time @xmath58 on @xmath44 . in region",
    "@xmath59 we have @xmath60 , @xmath61 and in region @xmath46 we have @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "the induced metric on @xmath44 induced from region @xmath45 is the same as that induced from region @xmath46 , and is given by@xmath64 this guarantees the existence of a coordinate system where the metric is continuous ( @xmath0 ) .    here",
    ", @xmath65 will be chosen to be the line element of a 3-manifold with ( intrinsic ) curvature @xmath66 i.e. it is a unit sphere , a hyperboloid or flat space respectively .",
    "although our interest will be mainly focused on the spherical shell similar features to those we will discuss hold also for the cases @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the hypersurface @xmath44 is the shell s world - volume , i.e. the four - dimensional history of the shell in spacetime .",
    "the intrinsic geometry is well defined on @xmath44 and given by ( [ 4-geometry ] ) . however , since the metric is only @xmath0 and not necessarily differentiable , the geometry of the embedding of @xmath44 into @xmath69 is independent of the embedding of @xmath44 into @xmath46 . the geometric information about the embedding is quantified by the extrinsic curvature as well as the orientation of @xmath44 with respect to each bulk region .    to be precise ,",
    "let us consider the following conventions for a timelike shell outside of any event horizon :    * the hypersurface @xmath44 has a single unit normal vector @xmath70 which points from left to right .",
    "* the orientation factor @xmath71 of each bulk region is defined as follows : @xmath72 if the radial coordinate @xmath36 points from left to right , while @xmath73 if the radial coordinate @xmath36 points from right to left .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ wormhole1 ] . notice that the wormhole depicted on the left of that figure is not the only possibility for @xmath74 .",
    "while this geometry roughly speaking corresponds to joining two `` exterior regions '' of a spherical solution , it is also feasible to construct a space by joining two `` interior regions '' , instead .",
    "this corresponds to the case @xmath74 as well .",
    "[ the definition ] the orientation defined by @xmath75 will be called the standard orientation . a shell with standard orientation",

    "this formula for the normal vector extends the definition of the orientation factors to the situation where the shell is inside the horizon when @xmath36 is a timelike coordinate .",
    "we can introduce the basis @xmath87 intrinsic to @xmath44 .",
    "the extrinsic curvature is then defined as @xmath88 . in terms of a coordinate basis we have @xmath89 and the extrinsic curvature takes the explicit form @xmath90 and in our case the components read @xmath91 we denote the extrinsic curvature with respect to the embedding into @xmath45 and @xmath46 by @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively . at a singular shell @xmath94 , i.e. the extrinsic curvature jumps from one side to the other .",
    "this is a covariant way of expressing the fact that the metric is not @xmath95 ( i.e. there does not exist any coordinate system where the metric is @xmath95 ) . in general relativity",
    "this amounts to saying that ( non - null ) vacuum shells do not exist since israel conditions can not be satisfied without the introduction of a induced stress tensor on the spherical shell .",
    "things are different in the case of the gravity theory defined by action ( [ the_action ] ) .",
    "this is because the gauss - bonnet term induces additional terms in the junction conditions , which supplements the israel equation . in section [ junction_section ]",
    "we will show how both contributions can be combined to yield vacuum spherically symmetric thin shells .",
    "first we briefly discuss spacelike shells .",
    "solutions of a different sort are those constructed by joining two spaces through a spacelike juncture .",
    "let us suppose now that @xmath44 is now a spacelike hypersurface .",
    "the motion of the shell in the @xmath57 plane is parameterized by @xmath96 , where it is necessary to remember that @xmath58 is now a spacelike coordinate on @xmath44 .",
    "the induced metric on @xmath44 is then given by @xmath97 the components of the normal vector with respect to the basis @xmath82 of @xmath45 and the basis @xmath84 of @xmath46 are respectively : @xmath98 this defines the orientation factors in the case of a spacelike shell .",
    "the components of the extrinsic curvature are : @xmath99      the einstein - gauss - bonnet field equations are well - defined distributionally at @xmath44 due to the property of quasi - linearity in second derivatives ( see e.g. refs  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , one can define a distributional stress tensor @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the intrinsic stress tensor induced on the shell and @xmath102 denotes a dirac delta function with support on the shell world - volume @xmath44 .    integrating the field equations from left to right in an infinitesimally thin region across @xmath44",
    "one obtains the junction condition .",
    "this relates the discontinuous change of spacetime geometry across @xmath44 with the stress tensor @xmath103 . for the einstein - gauss - bonnet theory",
    "the general formulas can be found in the refs .",
    "@xmath104 where the symmetric tensor @xmath105 is given by @xmath106 above , the sign @xmath107 depends on the signature of the junction hypersurface : it is minus for the timelike case and plus for the spacelike case .",
    "in this expression , lower case roman letters from the beginning of the alphabet @xmath108 , @xmath109 etc . represent four - dimensional tensor indices on the tangent space of the world - volume of the shell .",
    "the symbol @xmath110 refers to the extrinsic curvature , while the symbol @xmath111 appearing here corresponds to the four - dimensional intrinsic curvature ( see the appendix for details ) .    once applied to the spherically symmetric ( or @xmath68 , @xmath23 ) case the tensor @xmath112 turns out to be diagonal with components @xmath113 the precise form of @xmath114",
    "will not be needed but is given in the appendix for completeness .",
    "the above formula was written in a way that is valid for both timelike and spacelike shells , where we have defined @xmath115 also , let us be reminded of the fact that @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( with @xmath118 ) are the orientation factors in each region , which are independent one from each other . above , the subscripts @xmath119 , @xmath120 signify the quantity evaluated on @xmath44 induced by regions @xmath59 and @xmath46 respectively ( e.g. @xmath121 is a function of @xmath116 and @xmath122 ) , i.e. the metric function evaluated at the shell . in an abuse of notation we shall just write @xmath123 instead of @xmath124 . ] .",
    "one may verify that the following equation is satisfied @xmath125 which expresses the conservation of @xmath103 .",
    "the reason why one obtains exact conservation , i.e. no energy flow to the bulk , is that the normal - tangential components of the energy tensor in the bulk is the same in both sides of the junction hypersurface  @xcite .",
    "the main point here is that , unlike the israel conditions in einstein gravity , non - trivial solutions to ( [ explicit junction ij ] ) are possible even when @xmath126 .",
    "that is , the extrinsic curvature can be discontinuous across @xmath44 with no matter on the shell to serve as a source .",
    "the discontinuity is then self - supported gravitationally and this is due to non - trivial cancelations between the terms of the junction conditions .",
    "similar configurations are impossible in einstein gravity . from now on we consider the vacuum case @xmath127    in the next section we will treat the static shell in detail .",
    "an exhaustive study of the space of solutions describing both static and dynamical shells is left until sections 5 and 6 .",
    "let us now first briefly introduce the basic features of the general solution for a dynamical shell .",
    "equation ( [ q conservation ] ) tells us that when @xmath128 , the components of the junction condition are not independent ; namely @xmath129 therefore , for time - dependent solutions it suffices to impose only the first condition .",
    "this can be factorized as follows , @xmath130    equation ( [ explicit general junction ] ) contains all the information about the spherically symmetric junctions in empty space , which we generically call vacuum shells .",
    "certainly , there exist several cases to be explored .",
    "first of all , there are the parameters @xmath131 and @xmath132 , which characterize each of the two boulware - deser metrics to be joined .",
    "on the other hand , there are two possible orientations for each one of the spaces , and this is given by the sign of the respective @xmath133 .",
    "the solutions to ( [ explicit general junction ] ) include both wormhole - like and bubble - like geometries , depending on whether the orientation is @xmath134 or @xmath135 respectively .",
    "furthermore , there is the sign of @xmath136 , what tells us whether the signature of the junction hypersurface is timelike ( @xmath137 ) or spacelike ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "so , this permits a very interesting catalogue of geometries which we survey in section [ surveying static vacuum solutions ] and further explore in subsequent sections .",
    "the vanishing of the first factor in ( [ explicit general junction ] ) would imply that the metric is smooth across @xmath44 . rejecting this as the trivial solution",
    ", we demand that the second factor vanishes . from the second factor , squaring appropriately , we obtain @xmath139 along with two inequalities discussed below . the system ,",
    "because of the symmetry , has reduced to an essentially one - dimensional problem , given by the ordinary differential equation ( [ solved - explicit ] ) .",
    "it is seemingly equivalent to the problem of a particle moving in a potential @xmath140 .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth pointing out that , unlike the equation for a single particle , here we find that the energy @xmath141 is unavoidably fixed to zero instead of arising as a constant of motion .",
    "an important difference arises in the case where there is a minimum of @xmath140 precisely at @xmath142 .",
    "the constraint @xmath143 , provided the fact that the minimum of @xmath140 is precisely at zero energy , would lead to the conclusion that the shell can not move but it would be stacked at the bottom of the potential . actually , this is the case if no external system acts as a perturbation .",
    "one such perturbation can be thought of as being an incoming particle which , after perturbing the shell , scatters back to infinity spending an energy @xmath144 through the process .",
    "this would provide energy for the vacuum shell to move .",
    "one can also think about a slight change in the parameters of the solution yielding a shifting @xmath145 , see  @xcite .",
    "now , let us notice that since we have squared the junction condition , we must substitute ( [ solved - explicit ] ) back into ( [ explicit general junction ] ) to check the consistency .",
    "when doing so , the solutions of equation ( [ solved - explicit ] ) are solutions of the junction condition if and only if the following restrictions are obeyed @xmath146 and @xmath147    furthermore , we also have an inequality which is not an extra condition but rather follows as a consequence of equation ( [ solved - explicit ] ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath148 is positive in ( [ solved - explicit ] ) implies that @xmath149 for both timelike and spacelike .",
    "this inequality provides further information about the space of solutions of ( [ solved - explicit ] ) .",

    "the moduli space of these solutions is plotted in figure [ spacelikeregions_fig ] .",
    "they exist for @xmath177 .",
    "now , we will consider the case of static spherically symmetric shells with @xmath178 .",
    "this is an interesting special case .",
    "the analysis simplifies considerably and , besides , there are some qualitative differences between this and the case @xmath173 . in this case , the equations reduce to @xmath179 we see from the second equation that @xmath180 must be @xmath181 , i.e. static wormholes do not exist for @xmath178 .",
    "then , the solution is either @xmath182 or @xmath183 where @xmath184 the consistency of the solution requires @xmath185 so that @xmath186 and @xmath187 correspond to minus branch and exotic plus branch metrics respectively .",
    "there are solutions for all positive values of @xmath186 ( the plus branch mass parameter is also positive but in that case the bulk spacetime asymptotically takes the form of a negative mass ads - schwarzschild solution )",
    ". when the throat radius is small compared to the scale set by the gauss - bonnet coupling constant , @xmath188 , the masses are also small compared to @xmath189 , namely @xmath190 . on the other hand , for large radius @xmath191 , the masses are large , @xmath192 , @xmath193 .",
    "figure [ zerolmasspics ] shows a plot of the masses as a function of @xmath189 and also an implicit plot of @xmath194 as a function of @xmath186 .",
    "in the previous section we have shown the existence of static vacuum shells in the spherically symmetric case and found some basic qualitative features , as well as a formula for the mass parameters in each region .",
    "a more exhaustive treatment of the static shells will be left for section [ moduli_section ] . before going any",
    "further let us summarize the catalogue of vacuum solutions that arise through the geometric surgery we described above .",
    "the first cases of interest are those corresponding to the standard orientation @xmath195 .",
    "the vacuum shells with the standard orientation are always @xmath196 branch .",
    "so region @xmath45 has a different effective cosmological constant to region @xmath46 , as can be seen from the expansion of the metric for large @xmath36 .",
    "for example , when the bare cosmological constant @xmath178 we have on one side of the shell the effective cosmological constant @xmath197 and on the other @xmath198 . in the region with @xmath199 the graviton",
    "is expected to have ghost instability . in this sense",
    "the shell is like the false vacuum bubbles studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , but for a false vacuum which is of purely gravitational origin .    .",
    "a vacuum shell with the standard orientation always connects two regions with different branch signs @xmath132 ( and generically with different mass parameters @xmath35 ) .",
    "each region has a different effective cosmological constant.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    these kind of solutions might lead to curious implications .",
    "for instance , let us consider the following construction : suppose we have a",
    " well behaved \" minus branch ( @xmath200 ) solution with positive mass @xmath54 ; where by `` well behaved '' we mean a solution in which the singularity is hidden behind an event horizon and for which we get a suitable gr limit for small @xmath12 .",
    "now , let us cut out the black hole at some radius @xmath201 and then replace it with the interior of a plus branch ( @xmath202 ) solution , i.e. a naked singularity . by doing this we would be constructing a vacuum solution",
    "whose geometry , from the point of view of an external observer , would coincide with that of a black hole but , instead , would not possess a horizon .",
    "a particle in free fall would not find a horizon but rather a naked singularity as soon as it passes through the @xmath0 junction hypersurface located at @xmath203 .",
    "the solutions with @xmath178 and @xmath204 are a clear example of this .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ zerolmasspics ] there are solutions for all positive @xmath186 ; so that we can indeed cut out the event horizon and replace it with a naked singularity !    also , for @xmath173 `` false vacuum bubble '' solutions gluing a positive mass boulware - deser branch with a naked singularity do exist .",
    "this is seen by looking at the moduli space described in figure [ wormholeandplain_fig ] .",
    "one might expect that such cosmic - censorship - spoiling shells be unstable and in section [ dynamical general section ] we will confirm that they are unstable with respect to small perturbations .",
    "so far , we have discussed different kinds of geometries constructed by a cut and paste procedure of two spaces that were initially provided with the boulware - deser metric on them .",
    "the strategy was to make use of the junction conditions holding in einstein - gauss - bonnet theory and , in particular , we have shown that solutions with non - trivial topology , which have no analogues in einstein gravity , do arise through this method .",
    "a remarkable example is the existence of vacuum wormhole - like geometries , corresponding to the case @xmath74 .",
    "these `` wormholes '' can be thought of as belonging to two different classes : the first class describes actual wormholes , presenting two different asymptotic regions which are connected through a throat located at radius @xmath205 ; the radius of the throat being larger than the radius where the event horizons ( or naked singularities ) would be .",
    "the two asymptotic regions are @xmath206 and @xmath207 as measured by the radial coordinate in the respective sides of the junction .",
    "this type of geometry is an example of a vacuum spherically symmetric wormhole solution in lovelock theory and its existence is a remarkable fact on its own . on the other hand",
    ", a second class of wormhole - like geometry with no asymptotic regions also exists . this second class is obtained also by considering the orientation @xmath208 , this time cutting away the exterior region of both geometries and gluing the two interior regions together .",
    "we shall discuss this later ; first let us discuss the static wormhole solutions with two asymptotic regions ( actual wormholes ) .",
    "let us begin by emphasizing that such static wormhole solutions only exist if at least one of the two bulk regions corresponds to @xmath209 .",
    "that is , at least one of the two boulware - deser metrics has to correspond to what we have called the exotic branch .",
    "this could have deep implications in what regards semiclassical stability @xcite .",
    "it is also remarkable that for these static wormholes to exist it is necessary that @xmath162 .",
    "furthermore , the existence of two asymptotic regions demands @xmath163 ( for values @xmath210 there are only solutions withclosed universe \" geometry to be discussed below ) .",
    "moreover , since the static wormholes only exist if at least one of the branches corresponds to @xmath154 , then at least one of the regions connected through the throat possesses a negative effective cosmological constant .     for the case of the orientation",
    "this solution presents two disconnected asymptotically de - sitter regions.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=90.0% ] +    another interesting feature concerns the stability under radial perturbations .",
    "this is seen in fig [ v  ] .",
    "in particular , it can be shown that stable static wormholes only exist for the case @xmath212 ; namely , the case where both boulware - deser metrics correspond to the exotic branch .",
    "nevertheless , no stable wormholes exist for the case @xmath213 , and thus , concisely , the static symmetric wormholes are unstable under perturbations that preserve the spherical symmetry .",
    "an interesting possibility is that of having wormhole solutions whose boulware - deser metrics would correspond to negative mass parameters .",
    "for instance , one can construct a static wormhole with one side being of the `` good branch '' @xmath200 and having a negative mass @xmath214 . in that case , from the point of view of a naive external observer , the vacuum solution would seem to correspond to a naked singularity .",
    "however , now we know that the inclusion of non - trivial junctures makes it possible to replace such a singularity by an exterior region on the other side of a non - smooth wormhole throat .",
    "this has a deep implication in what concerns the `` cosmic censorship principle '' since for the appropriate values of the coupling constants , and unlike what usually happens in pure gravitational theories , the spherically symmetric vacuum solutions presenting naked singularity can not be unambiguously classified ( and consequently systematically excluded ) in terms of the mass parameter .",
    "another particular case that deserves to be mentioned as a special one is that of having a massless solution in one of the sides of the wormhole geometry .",
    "for instance , such a construction is achieved if the massless side corresponds to the exotic branch @xmath154 and the massive side to the branch @xmath33 . in these cases ,",
    "the wormhole throat turns out to be a kind of puncture of the ( a)ds spacetime , let us call it a `` hole in the vacuum '' . since ( a)ds is homogeneously isotropic , a spherically symmetric matching can be done anywhere : remarkably , several of these  holes \" could be located at different places in the spacetime and each `` hole '' would not influence the others . we shall discuss this kind of geometry in more detail in section [ octopus section ] .",
    "the massless side may then correspond to a microscopic de - sitter geometry and , presumably , its cosmological horizon , yielding thermal radiation , could be seen from the massive sides .",
    "this is an intriguing possibility that deserves to be further explored .",
    "now , let us comment on the second class of wormholes ; namely those with no asymptotic regions .",
    "as mentioned , these geometries are constructed by gluing the interior of the throat of both regions , instead of the exterior .",
    "one can perform the matching by keeping the region that is inside the throat but still outside the horizons .",
    "consequently , one gets a geometry that resembles a `` static closed universe '' with horizons .",
    "this exotic geometry has no asymptotic regions at all , and , because of this , this second type of geometry does not represent what one would usually call a wormhole .",
    "nevertheless , we shall abuse the notation and call `` wormhole '' any timelike junction with the orientation @xmath215 .",
    "static solutions of this kind without naked singularities ( i.e. with horizon ) exist for negative values of the coupling @xmath12 and @xmath216 . in this range of the coupling constants the boulware - deser metric develops a branch singularity at fixed radius @xmath217 , where the curvature diverges .",
    "this branch singularity represents the maximum three - sphere radius : the metric becomes non - real for @xmath218 .",
    "in addition there is a curvature singularity at @xmath219 . in this region of the space of parameters we would say that the boulware - deser geometry is somehow pathological .",
    "however , if junction conditions are appropriately applied , then a well - behaved @xmath0 vacuum geometry can be constructed by simply taking a pair of such pathological spaces , cutting out the naked singularities and joining them together . to see that this is possible , it is sufficient to consider the symmetrical case . it can be checked from equations ( [ mass_formula_1 ] ) and ( [ mass_formula_2 ] ) that two bulk regions with equal masses @xmath220 can be matched at a throat radius @xmath221 .",
    "consulting figure [ branchestimelikewormhol_fig ] ( these solutions are located on the upper bounding curve of the left part of the moduli space ) we see that wormhole solutions exist when the bulk regions have branch signs @xmath222 .",
    "the bulk metric has a horizon @xmath223 , which separates @xmath219 ( a timelike naked singularity ) from @xmath224 , which is a spacelike singularity .",
    "the static shell is located at @xmath225 .",
    "so by cutting out the regions @xmath226 and joining with the wormhole orientation the naked singularities can be removed .",
    "the causal diagram of the original pathological spacetimes and the extended causal diagram of the @xmath0 closed universe , which results from the matching , with horizons are shown in figure [ penrose_closed_universe ] .    , @xmath227 .",

    "( c ) causal diagram of the resulting spacetime ( a @xmath0 , spherically symmetric vacuum solution ) . ]    [ penrose_closed_universe ]",
    "in general , vacuum shells will be dynamical objects .",
    "we discuss the dynamics here and also discuss the issue of radial stability of the static solutions .",
    "let us briefly recapitulate upon the equation ( [ solved - explicit ] ) , which governs the dynamics of the shells .",
    "we can treat both the timelike and spacelike together since , as we noticed in section 2 , the analysis is completely analogous .",
    "a dynamical vacuum shell is governed by a differential equation of the form @xmath229 see ( [ solved - explicit ] ) above .",
    "it is useful to express @xmath140 in terms of the non - negative quantity @xmath230 , and the effective potential then reads @xmath231 in addition to the differential equation , the solution must obey the inequalities ( [ timed ineq_ys])-([spacelike real roots_ys ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite them as follows @xmath232 @xmath233    note that the effective potential ( [ tonga ] ) , @xmath234 , consists of a quadratic piece , a constant determined by the three - dimensional curvature @xmath235 of the shell , and another piece which , by inequality ( [ ineq_sum ] ) obeys @xmath236 .    to analyze the motion of a shell we shall need to know the derivatives of the potential",
    "this is worked out in appendix [ potential_appendix ] .",
    "differentiating the potential we get the following expression for the acceleration of a moving shell , @xmath237\\ .\\ ] ] considering the sign of this acceleration and making use of inequality ( [ ineq_sum ] ) we can make some general observations :    [ force_remark ] for a timelike shell ( @xmath238 ) : + when @xmath239 and @xmath210 a vacuum shell always experiences a repulsive force away from @xmath240 ; + when @xmath241 and @xmath242 a vacuum shell always experiences an attractive force towards @xmath243 .",
    "in the situations not covered by remark [ force_remark ] the potential may have an extremum . from ( [ force ] )",
    "we deduce that there is an extremum at @xmath244 iff @xmath245 recalling inequality ( [ ineq_sum ] ) , we conclude that an extremum can exist only if @xmath246    the extremum will be a minimum or maximum depending on the sign of the second derivative of the potential evaluated there , @xmath247 there is a general result for vacuum shells separating different branch metrics . from ( [ sigma alpha w ] )",
    "we see that @xmath248 in ( [ extremum v  in ys ] ) must be negative for @xmath249 .",
    "[ no minimum ] in the range ) , the result can be extended to apply to the range @xmath250 . ]",
    "@xmath251 for the product of gauss - bonnet coupling and cosmological constant : let @xmath44 be a vacuum shell such that @xmath252 . then the potential never has a minimum .",
    "if @xmath44 is a timelike shell it will either be in an ( unstable ) static state , or , if it is moving , will either expand or collapse , it can not be bound .",
    "we have already remarked in section 2 that any shell with standard orientation _ must _ match two bulk metrics of opposite branch sign ( @xmath253 ) , except in the trivial case of a smooth matching .",
    "so we obtain the following general result about instability of standard shells :    let @xmath249 . a timelike shell with standard orientation",
    "is either in an ( unstable ) static motion , or , if it is moving , will either expand or collapse , it can not be bound .",
    "we have already seen in section [ static_section ] that static shells with standard orientation are always in a state of unstable equilibrium in the ( physical ) regime @xmath254 .",
    "the proposition above strengthens this result to include dynamical shells .",
    "a dynamical shell with standard orientation can not be oscillatory .",
    "it must either disappear into a singularity or fly out towards spatial infinity .",
    "there is not such a strong result for shells with the wormhole orientation .",
    "indeed in section [ static_section ] we found stable static wormholes for @xmath251 which matched two bulk metrics of the plus branch .",
    "we can however derive a strong result about instability concerning bulk metrics of the minus branch .",
    "when @xmath255 we see from ( [ extremum xis and w ] ) that for @xmath249 an extremum is not possible .",
    "furthermore , combining the results of remarks [ minus_minus_remark ] and [ force_remark ] we see that the shell is always expanding :    [ repulsion ] let @xmath251 and let @xmath44 be a timelike vacuum shell with wormhole orientation , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 be minus branch bulk metrics @xmath256 .",
    "then the shell always experiences a repulsive force away from @xmath240 .",
    "so in summary , we have found some general results for the range of parameters @xmath251 .",
    "this range is important because it includes the case @xmath257 and therefore applies when the gauss - bonnet term is a small correction . combining these results ,",
    "we conclude that , in this range of parameters , all timelike vacuum shells involving the minus branch are unstable .",
    "the only vacuum shell solutions which can be static or oscillatory are wormholes which match two regions of the exotic plus branch .      dynamical equation ( [ tonga2 ] )",
    "resembles the equation for a particle moving under the influence of an effective potential ( [ tonga ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , as pointed out in section 2 , this is not strictly the case due to the presence of the vanishing energy constraint .",
    "this is important for the case when the extremum of the potential is at @xmath258 with @xmath259 , i.e. when static solutions exist . when @xmath260 we conclude that the shell is unstable with respect to the radial component of a perturbation- a slight shift @xmath261 will cause the shell to accelerate away from the ( unstable ) equilibrium radius . when @xmath262 we conclude that the shell is stable with respect to radial perturbations .",
    "there is however a slight subtlety : as mentioned previously the energy is unavoidably fixed instead of arising as a constant of motion .",
    "so for a fixed potential , there is no real solution for @xmath108 when @xmath263 .",
    "we can consider spherically symmetric solutions which are close - by in the space of the solutions , i.e. with slightly different parameters @xmath264 and @xmath265 such that the value of the potential at @xmath266 is slightly negative : let us say @xmath267 .",
    "this means that such a solution oscillates between two radii around @xmath266 at which the potential vanishes .",
    "this is certainly a stable solution though not static , a ` bounded excursion '  @xcite . now",
    "if we let @xmath266 coincide with the @xmath268 of the original static solution , this means that for slightly different parameters than those for which @xmath268 is a static solution , there exists an oscillating solution around @xmath268",
    ". therefore a static solution @xmath268 which is a minimum of the potential gives information about when infinitesimal bounded excursions can happen .",
    "more generally , the dynamics of the perturbed shell can be thought of as corresponding to a perturbation of the above equation @xmath269 , provided energy @xmath144 from an external excitation .",
    "the stable regions of the moduli space of static solutions are plotted in figures [ v  ] and [ plainstabilitytimelikepic_fig ] .",
    "the graph will take an elegant form in terms of the change of variables to be introduced in section [ moduli_section ] ( see fig [ ddvfinal ] ) .",
    "+ in the rest of this section we present some illustrative examples of dynamical vacuum shells , first in symmetrical wormhole solutions and then in the context of chern - simons gravity .",
    "now let us consider the case where the masses in each bulk region are the same , being @xmath270 .",
    "the inequalities ( [ ineq_prod ] ) and ( [ ineq_sum ] ) are equivalent to :    if @xmath44 is a vacuum shell joining two bulk regions with the same mass @xmath271 then : + i ) the bulk solutions must have the same branch sign @xmath272 ; + ii ) the shell must have wormhole orientation .",

    "when @xmath296 the bulk metric would have a naked singularity at the origin .",

    "the solution is constrained according to the two inequalities ( [ ineq_prod ] ) and ( [ ineq_sum ] ) , which now read @xmath301 @xmath302 the last inequality tells that @xmath303 .",
    "these inequalities are generally consistent with @xmath304 so that solutions do indeed exist .",

    "timelike vacuum shells always represent either : + i ) a matching between a bulk region of a black hole spacetime with bulk region of a naked singularity spacetime ; or + ii ) a matching , with wormhole orientation , between two bulk regions of naked singularity spacetimes .",

    "we see from ( [ mass formulas ] ) that given a mass @xmath370 , for given @xmath189 and @xmath7 , the radius @xmath268 of the shell where the matching takes place is determined by a fourth order polynomial of @xmath337 , namely @xmath412 given a @xmath337 we can obtain @xmath338 by ( [ a_0 of u ] ) . as discussed in lemma [ mirror lemma ]",

    "so , one may ask the following : for a given @xmath413 , and a given @xmath265 , how many _ different _ real solutions @xmath337 exist and what is their sign ?",
    "now , the l.h.s . of ( [ 4th polynomial ] ) is an even order polynomial .",
    "then we know that there must be at least a second @xmath337 producing the same @xmath416 .",
    "what we a priori do not know is whether the second @xmath337 is of the same sign or of the opposite .",
    "there is one case where the second solution coincides with the first , and therefore has the same sign .",
    "this is when the root @xmath337 is also an extremum of the polynomial .",
    "it is easy to verify when this happens .",
    "we simply differentiate the polynomial w.r.t . @xmath337 and use ( [ mass formulas ] ) to find the following answer @xmath417 the points on the orientation curve @xmath418 are not included in the moduli space .",
    "therefore we have that there is a single @xmath337 when @xmath413 and @xmath265 are such that @xmath419 .",
    "we will see below that this is the _ stability curve _ i.e. the curve which separates the radially stable from the unstable solutions on the moduli space as we will see below ( see also figure [ ddvfinal ] ) .",
    "a related fact is given in the following    [ stability curve and mass extrema ] for fixed @xmath189 and @xmath7 we can think of the masses as functions of the radius of the shell @xmath268@xmath420 @xmath421 .",
    "the function @xmath422 has a global minimum and the function @xmath423 has a global maximum for radii @xmath268 given by @xmath419 .",
    "thus , there is simpler question one may ask : given _ pair _ of masses @xmath187 and @xmath186 , when can the matching happen at more than one shell radii @xmath268 ?",
    "the answer is that this can never happen :    [ unique_proposition ] for any @xmath265 , any @xmath337 such that @xmath341 belongs to the moduli space gives a pair of mass parameters @xmath414 and @xmath415 .",
    "then , this is the unique @xmath337 that gives these mass parameters .    the proof is given in appendix [ moduli_appendix ] .",
    "therefore , remembering that @xmath337 is single valued in terms of the shell radius @xmath268 , the junction conditions define a single - valued function @xmath424 , in fact one - to - one on the space of the allowed values of @xmath370 .",
    "as we know from section [ junction_section ] @xmath268 is a symmetric function of @xmath54 and @xmath53 and it is given by @xmath424 , via the correspondence implied in ( [ swap ] ) .",
    "thus given the bulk metrics , the @xmath425constant vacuum shell is _",
    "unique_. so we see that a weakened version of uniqueness of solutions does survive .",
    "note that for shells with standard orientation there are exactly two inequivalent configurations corresponding to the same shell radius , depending on whether @xmath187 is the mass of the inner or the outer region .      we notice that , throughout the computations , the quantity@xmath426appears often .",
    "now we comment on how it turns out to be convenient to extract information on the moduli space .",
    "first , notice that @xmath427 clearly vanishes at @xmath355 and @xmath392 .",
    "we also encounter the curves @xmath428 which in detail correspond to @xmath429 we also found the curve where @xmath383 to be @xmath430 respectively . and notice that in terms of @xmath427 this simply reads @xmath431    the first four curves in our list , which involve @xmath427 , are conic sections with symmetry axes the lines @xmath432 and @xmath372 .",
    "the orientation and branch curves on the other hand have symmetry axes the lines @xmath355 and @xmath372 .",
    "the conic sections and especially the causality curve which is an ellipse , @xmath433 , break the symmetry between positive and negative values of @xmath265 .",
    "the image of the causality curve around @xmath355 would be centered at @xmath434 i.e. @xmath435 .",
    "the above analysis manifestly shows that the quantity @xmath436 captures much important information about the moduli space .",
    "actually , the parameterization of the space of solutions in terms of variables ( @xmath437 ) had shown to present advantages in order to classify the whole set of solutions . to emphasize this , and for completeness",
    ", let us also express the regions of radial stability over the moduli space in terms of these variables .",
    "such regions are known to be characterized by the second derivative of the effective potential , which in terms of @xmath337 and @xmath265 is seen to be @xmath438 the regions where @xmath439 are shown in figure [ ddvfinal ] .",
    "@xmath440 along the curve @xmath419 which we have already called the stability curve , for reasons that become clear now . according to remark [ stability curve and mass extrema",
    "] this is where the mass @xmath441 have extrema .",
    "in einstein gravity in four dimensions there is a variety of smooth , everywhere non - singular vacuum configurations in general characterized by some non - trivial topological property , e.g. euler number .",
    "any topological property they may have is an intrinsic feature of the smooth solution .    in five dimensions and in einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity",
    "similar configurations may exist as well .",
    "the equations of motions though are such that one can manufacture , by cut and paste along the world - volume of vacuum shells , similar kind of solutions with the difference that they are not smooth , i.e. not @xmath95 . in this case",
    "there is no intrinsic property in the vacuum solution , we are simply building objects which are much simpler locally .",
    "for that reason one may call these objects non - topological , though they certainly have non - trivial topological features . an analogy for this would be the difference existing between an object with an exactly given smooth metric which has the topology , e.g. of the sphere , and tetrahedra built out of flat pieces .",
    "this digression leads us to recognize a great difference with respect to four dimensions .",
    "unlike in four dimensions , in five - dimensional lovelock theory , spacetimes which are defined by some simple property locally , for example being vacuum and spherically symmetric , are by no means well defined globally , if smoothness is given up .",
    "for each such metric , which may itself have non - trivial topological features , one can construct infinitely many other spacetimes by cut and paste which locally are given by the same simple property .",
    "that is , the theory allows for many different topologies where one would expect it to allow only for different coordinates .    a general analysis of the objects obtained by geometric surgery along vacuum shells is an interesting problem and contains much of the actual physics of five - dimensional lovelock gravity ( that is , einstein plus the gauss - bonnet term ) .",
    "in this work we mainly focus on the direct implications of their existence illustrated by appropriate examples .",
    "a systematic analysis is left for future work .",
    "below we analyze how a constant curvature vacuum is modified by wormholes ( and related configurations ) .",
    "it turns out that , the smaller such constructions with wormholes are with respect to the scale set by @xmath189 , the more complicated the topology can be .",
    "an interesting special case of a wormhole is when on one side we have pure vacuum , as mentioned already in section 4 .",
    "starting from a constant curvature background , by introducing the vacuum wormhole we cut a hole in the constant curvature manifold , replacing it with an `` outgoing '' spacetime region of mass parameter @xmath35 .",
    "of course the topology of the vacuum is not the same anymore ; there are now non - contractible 3-spheres .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out that these configurations are everywhere non - singular in the following sense : _ _ the only singularities that exist in spacetime are integrable__.    these wormholes belong to a more general class of constructions : depending on whether the vacuum shell is time- or space - like and the orientation of the matching ( i.e. the different combinations of the orientation signs @xmath116 and @xmath117 ) , one obtains distinct types of configurations some of which contain only integrable singularities .",
    "configurations we call `` instantons '' mentioned below belong to this more general class .",
    "the analysis gets simplified and clarified if we express everything in terms of the constant curvature .",
    "when the mass parameter is zero the metric is defined as @xmath442 this means that for the metric of branch @xmath39 we have : @xmath443 these configurations exist for @xmath385 .",
    "we consult remark [ overall zero mass ] and also proposition [ zero mass proposition 0 ] .",
    "the relevant points on the moduli space are on the curve @xmath444 . according to proposition [ pre total moduli ] the points on this curve such that @xmath445 correspond to standard shell configurations .",
    "in detail , standard shells are the configurations corresponding to : @xmath446 for @xmath447 , and @xmath448 for @xmath449 .",
    "@xmath450 is a continuous curve .",
    "the points with @xmath355 and @xmath392 do not belong in the moduli space .",
    "the same for the points with @xmath451 and @xmath452 .",
    "so in all , from ( [ k ] ) we have that @xmath453 .",
    "now from remark [ overall zero mass ] and proposition [ zero mass proposition 0 ] one finds that the mass in all cases is @xmath454 also @xmath455    we have that this construction is possible when @xmath385 .",
    "therefore , from remark [ alpha>0 ] , we have that the sign of @xmath189 depends solely on the causal character of the vacuum shell .",
    "namely , it is @xmath204 when the shell is timelike , and @xmath177 when the shell is spacelike .",
    "we have the following    all standard orientation shell configurations with zero mass in one of the bulk regions are spacelike .",
    "the variable @xmath456 takes values on the entire real line with the exception of the points @xmath457 . with these exceptions in mind",
    "we have :    spacelike shells i.e. @xmath177@xmath420 @xmath458 . in the interval",
    "@xmath459 exist all the standard shell configurations .",
    "timelike shells i.e. @xmath204@xmath420 @xmath460    the mass @xmath35 has poles at the boundary of the spacelike shell region .",
    "one may note that thought of as a function of @xmath189 both poles are of first order .",
    "from the formula @xmath444 we find for the radius of the shell in all cases is @xmath461    the vacuum of constant curvature @xmath462 is a locally homogeneous spacetime and in particular is locally spatially homogeneous .",
    "having placed one vacuum shell around some arbitrarily chosen origin , we have seen that outside of the shell the homogeneity is everywhere maintained . as long as it does not cross the first",
    ", we may place a second vacuum shell and in fact an arbitrary number of them modifying the manifold in a way depicted in fig .",
    "[ octopus ] .",
    "let @xmath463 and @xmath204 .",
    "it is useful to rewrite this as @xmath464 it is clear from both the last formula that in units of @xmath189 the radius of the shell is an increasing function of the radius of universe @xmath465 .",
    "when the shell is microscopic , i.e. small in units of @xmath189 , we have that @xmath466 . when the shell is macroscopic we have that @xmath467 .",
    "a microscopic universe could fit roughly @xmath468 vacuum shells of radius @xmath268 .",
    "so the more microscopic the universe the more complicated its topology can be .      reversing in a sense our viewpoint from the previous section",
    ", we may think of the matching of a massive metric with one of constant curvature along a vacuum shell , as a way to eliminate the singularity at the origin , or better to replace it with an integrable singularity along the vacuum shell .",
    "consider for example configurations along the curve @xmath469 and @xmath204 i.e. @xmath470 ( and the vacuum shell is static ) .",
    "then @xmath463 , that is @xmath471 and @xmath472 , and the massive branch is an exotic branch ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "this metric alone has a naked singularity at the origin . by constructing the vacuum wormhole we have managed to replace a region around the origin with a region of a de sitter spacetime which contains the horizon",
    "that is , the spacetime which asymptotically looks like an exotic branch , massive , boulware - deser spacetime is actually everywhere non - singular and has horizons .",
    "we might reasonably expect that thermal effects of the horizons will be felt in this would - be singular spacetime .",
    "the mass parameter @xmath35 in the massive region is determined by the curvature @xmath462 of the de sitter region .",
    "so then , the de sitter space mimics a particle , or some fairly localized mass , as viewed from sufficiently far away .",
    "the entropy @xmath473 related to the existence of the de sitter horizon depends on @xmath462 and therefore on @xmath35 .",
    "we expect @xmath474 .",
    "we know that @xmath475 . therefore that entropy will decrease with @xmath35 .",
    "this is not surprising since a positive mass in the exotic branch behaves effectively like a negative gravitational mass .",
    "the previous example shows that the spectrum of black holes in einstein gravity modified by the gauss - bonnet term is not the same when @xmath0 metrics are allowed , compared to the smooth boulware - deser metrics .",
    "a space which by an asymptotic observer who thinks in terms of smooth metrics would not be recognized as a black hole might actually be one .",
    "conversely , a spacetime which asymptotically would be a recognized as a boulware - deser black hole , could actually be a spacetime with a naked singularity , or a black hole different to the one expected .",
    "consider , for example , the case @xmath30 and @xmath177 . from the analysis in appendix [ bd appendix ]",
    "we see that this spacetime is a black hole for @xmath476 ( and @xmath40 ) .",
    "the horizon hides an inner branch singularity .",
    "our analysis in section [ moduli_section ] shows that we can cut this spacetime and match it with wormhole orientation along a spacelike shell , i.e. within the horizon , with another spacetime of exotic branch metric . in that spacetime @xmath36",
    "is everywhere a timelike variable .",
    "thus although outside the horizon spacetime looks like a specific boulware - deser black hole spacetime it can actually be a different one .",
    "the two different states have the same energy as measured at spatial infinity and horizons with the same properties : as black holes they must be degenerate . whether the usual entropy calculations take into account the effects of this degeneracy in the number of states is not clear to us .",
    "it is amusing to think that the modifications to the usual bekenstein - hawking formula in the presence of the gauss - bonnet term , see e.g.  @xcite , are essentially due to such degeneracies .",
    "the analysis has focused on the spherically symmetric case ( @xmath315 ) .",
    "this can readily be extended to the case of @xmath477 ( where the bulk metrics are taken to be topological black holes , with horizons some compactified hyperbolic space , or the corresponding naked singularity spacetime ) .",
    "similar features are expected to occur ( wormholes and shells of standard orientation exist , typically involving the exotic plus branch . ) also the case of @xmath67 for toroidal black holes or naked singularity spacetimes , can be investigated .",
    "we have seen that spacelike shells exist , representing a sudden transition from one solution to another .",
    "these present problems in terms of the predictability of the field equations",
    ". it would be useful to know whether the shells are generic or if they only occur for a certain range of the coupling constants and mass parameters .",
    "the euclidean version of the @xmath0 wormholes may be important for estimating the transition rate between the ( unstable ) plus branch and the ( stable ) minus branch solutions .",
    "these are left for future work .      in this work",
    "we construct and analyze solutions of einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity whose metric is class @xmath0 , piecewise analytic in the coordinates .",
    "the solutions are made by joining together two spherically symmetric pieces .",
    "since the shell itself admits @xmath478 isometry group , the resulting global spacetime is spherically symmetric .",
    "to put things into this context and discuss the special implications of low differentiability we start by reviewing the existing relevant theorems in einstein and lovelock gravity .",
    "we start with a uniqueness and staticity theorem , applying to lovelock gravity in general , which imposes the stronger conditions on differentiability .",
    "for generic values of the couplings ( including the cosmological constant ) , class @xmath43 solutions of the lovelock gravity field equations with spherical , planar or hyperbolic symmetry are isometric to the corresponding static solutions .    in particular , in einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity in five dimensions @xmath43 solutions with spherical symmetry are isometric to the boulware - deser solutions when @xmath479 .",
    "when we let the metric become merely continuous at hypersurfaces , we have seen already that one can construct many different time - independent solutions of the vacuum field equations : for example , when @xmath30 with @xmath204 , one can construct multiple concentric vacuum discontinuities separating boulware - deser solutions .",
    "so uniqueness of black hole solutions does not hold for @xmath0 metrics in lovelock gravity .",
    "in fact neither does staticity .",
    "we return to discuss this below , after we revisit the corresponding theorems in einstein gravity .    a differentiability class @xmath0 and",
    "spherically symmetric vacuum solution of einstein gravity is : @xmath480 ) static , @xmath481 ) equivalent to the schwarzschild solution .    that a spherically symmetric vacuum solution is static can be shown by finding a timelike killing vector , which also happens to be hypersurface orthogonal , even when the solution is given in forms that do nt look very much like the usual schwarzschild metric and which assume lower differentiability @xcite , see @xcite .",
    "a @xmath0 solution of the einstein gravity field equations is well defined as the limit of a sequence of ( at least ) @xmath43 solutions .",
    "the metric is assumed to become @xmath0 only at smooth hypersurfaces .",
    "fields of low differentiability , e.g. with a discontinuous first derivative , can be understood as solutions of field equations in the weak sense , as limits of sequences of smoother fields . the fact that this limit is well defined makes the junction conditions of israel well defined ( the above work appeared earlier than israel s famous work ) .",
    "now based on the junction conditions one may conclude : any hypersurfaces where the metric is not smooth must be a null hypersurfaces ( we may call them shock waves ) . then one may show that there are no spherically symmetric shock waves in einstein gravity , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the result regarding limits of smooth metrics holds in einstein - gauss - bonnet and in fact in lovelock gravity in general ( see the appendix of ref .",

    "via the simple relations of @xmath168 and @xmath167 to the couplings these read for non - zero @xmath7 : @xmath483 and @xmath484 respectively . as can be seen from the results of section [ moduli_section ] they actually hold for @xmath30 as well . ]",

    "so it must either deviate slightly from spherical symmetry or have some small amount of matter as source . assuming that suitable @xmath489 can be constructed which obey the energy conditions , our results can be taken as evidence for the generic existence of such exotic features as smooth wormholes in this theory .",

    "the spherically symmetric static solution of einstein - gauss - bonnet theory of gravity was obtained by boulware and deser in 1985 , [ ref ] . in five dimensions , and in terms of a suitable schwarzschild - like ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) ,",
    "the metric is given by ( [ bd_metric ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , if the higher dimensional theory with the dimensionally extended quadratic gauss - bonnet term is considered , then the black hole solutions take a similar form , namely @xmath495where @xmath496 is an integration constant , and @xmath497 is a numerical factor proportional to @xmath498 and which only depends on the dimension @xmath499 .",

    "now , let us analyse the large distance limit of the solution ( [ bd_metric ] ) .",
    "asymptotically , this solution tends to the five - dimensional schwarzschild solution when @xmath504 , as it is naturally expected .",
    "namely @xmath505which represents a ( a)ds - schwarzschild black hole in five dimensions .",

    "for instance , the finite-@xmath12 corrections to the mass are found by simply collecting the coefficients of the newtonian term @xmath514 .",
    "the parameter @xmath515 controls the _ dressing _ of the whole set of black hole parameters .",
    "the above power expansion converges for values such that @xmath516 . on the other hand , for @xmath517 we find a different expansion ,",
    "leading to the following _ dressed _ parameters in the large @xmath36 regime @xmath518 thus , we note that the newtonian term @xmath519 vanishes in the limit @xmath520 .",
    "the particular case @xmath521 is discussed below .",
    "moreover , it is possible to see that , if one considers the case @xmath522 , the effective cosmological constant in the large @xmath515 limit turns out to be @xmath523    one of the relevant differences existing between the black hole solutions in einstein theory and in einstein - gauss - bonnet theory is the fact that , in the latter , the metric does not diverge at the origin of schwarzschild coordinates , @xmath524 though its curvature is still singular . from ( [ bd_metric ] )",
    ", we easily observe@xmath525 in particular , this implies that the metric presents a angular deficit around the origin , and , also , that massive objects with no even horizon exist ; thus , these correspond to naked singularities .",
    "another interesting feature of the presence of the gauss - bonnet term is that , for the particular choice of the parameters @xmath526 , the solution takes the form@xmath527where we have considered @xmath528 and @xmath163 , and where @xmath529 .",
    "this solution resembles the baados - teitelboim - zanelli black hole @xcite .",

    "( [ gaston ] ) plays the role of the mass @xmath35 in the btz solution .",
    "for instance , just like @xmath531 space - time is obtained as a particular case of the btz geometry by setting the negative mass @xmath532 , the five - dimensional anti - de sitter space corresponds to setting @xmath533 in eq .",
    "( [ gaston ] ) .",
    "moreover , notice that in the large @xmath534 limit the solution becomes the metric to which @xmath535 tends in the near boundary limit .",
    "similarly , the massless btz corresponds to the boundary of @xmath531 .",
    "besides , as it was already mentioned , a conical singularity is found in the range @xmath536 ( corresponding to @xmath537 ) , and this completes the parallelism with the three - dimensional  black hole .",

    "the metric has two branches for given cosmological constant @xmath7 and energy @xmath35 : @xmath539 .",
    "[ these we call as the plus- and minus- branch respectively ; also , more descriptively , as the `` exotic '' and the `` good '' branch . ] therefore solving the vacuum field equations for spherically symmetric metrics we obtain _ two _ solutions .",

    "the @xmath29 branch depends on @xmath189 asymptotically , while the asymptotically flat branch @xmath40 does not .",
    "also , the sign of the schwarzschild type of term depends on the branch : the two branches view the energy @xmath35 differently , i.e. the exotic metric of the boulware - deser solution does not reduce to einstein solution in the `` infrared '' limit .",
    "the sign @xmath39 is in some sense a charge which determines how a certain energy @xmath35 enters a metric and thus if the field will be attractive or repulsive .",
    "as noted in @xcite , the graviton is a ghost on the asymptotic @xmath29 branch , because the linear einstein tensor appears to have the opposite overall sign ( that is , this metric is classically unstable ) .",
    "this wrong sign is reflected in the inverted sign of the schwarzschild term .",
    "an interesting issue about the boulware - deser solutions is that it contains a square root , whose reality imposes constraints . from ( [ bd_metric ] ) we see that : when @xmath386 there is a _ maximum _ radius ; when @xmath542 there is a _ minimum _",
    "radius in spacetime . at those finite radii there exists curvature singularities , known as branch singularities  @xcite .",
    "we call them outer and inner branch singularities , respectively to the cases above .",
    "these unusual spacetimes can also have horizons behind which the singularities are hidden .",
    "we turn now to discuss the horizon structure of the boulware - deser spacetimes .",
    "the following does not intend to be an exhaustive analysis , it is rather a list of general formulas in our notation useful for our purposes .",
    "we will use the dimensionless parameters @xmath265 and @xmath381 . recall the boulware - deser metric function @xmath543 given in ( [ bd_metric ] ) and define @xmath223 by @xmath544 .",

    "so one may specify one type of quantities @xmath672 , @xmath414 on the whole plane and mirror image the results to obtain the values of @xmath675 and @xmath415 .",
    "now , we will also return to discuss in a more detailed manner the two most basic distinct types of constructions here ( recall definition [ the definition ] ) : matching with the same orientation , i.e. standard shell solutions , and matching with opposite orientation , which we call collectively wormholes . though the following definition has been already in use in our work",
    ", it is useful to formalize the following    [ plus minus metrics ] a plus - metric , corresponding to the metric function @xmath702 , is one whose mass parameters is given by @xmath703 and branch by @xmath704 over the moduli space .",
    "a minus - metric , corresponding to the metric function @xmath705 ) , is one whose mass parameters is given by @xmath706 and branch by @xmath707 over the moduli space .",
    "now , let us make a remark on the sign of @xmath12 . as @xmath708 it can be determined by the sign of @xmath709 and",
    "is given by @xmath710 therefore we have    [ alpha>0 ] @xmath204 only for timelike vacuum shells and in the region @xmath385 ( for standard or wormhole orientation ) . inside the ellipse of the spacelike vacuum shells",

    "+ * proof of proposition [ unique_proposition ] : * for a given @xmath265 , let @xmath713 be such that the corresponding point ( @xmath714 ) belongs to the moduli space .",
    "we have @xmath715 of course @xmath716 .",
    "there are two special cases to deal with before proceeding .",
    "first , consider @xmath717 .",
    "we know that this is possible if and only if @xmath718 .",
    "so for non - unique solutions we may restrict ourselves to @xmath719 .",
    "the second case is when @xmath720 .",
    "this happens in the moduli space along the circle : @xmath721 .",
    "clearly there is a unique positive @xmath713 solving this equation .",
    "therefore it is adequate to consider @xmath719 and masses such that @xmath722 .",
    "the proof is by contradiction .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath713 is not unique in the sense that there exists some @xmath723 in the moduli space such that @xmath724 and which gives the same masses @xmath725 with a little rearranging subtracting the respective equations we have @xmath726 @xmath727 so the quantities in the big brackets vanish .",
    "adding and subtracting them we obtain the equations @xmath728 via ( [ a0 uniqueness ] ) these equations express @xmath729 in terms of @xmath713 and @xmath265 .",
    "the second of these tells us that @xmath730 so we conclude that @xmath729 is negative , contradicting the assumption .",
