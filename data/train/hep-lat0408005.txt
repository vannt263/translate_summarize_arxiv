    "there has been continual interest in formulating physical theories on a discrete lattice @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",

    ", we shall discuss aspects of a lattice version of classical electrodynamics based on a geometric discretization @xcite@xcite .",
    "there are three main approaches to discretize maxwell equations : finite differences @xcite@xcite , finite elements @xcite and finite volumes @xcite .",
    "however , naive implementations of these finite methods to discretize maxwell equations on irregular lattices are known to cause problems , such as spurious modes @xcite and late - time unconditional instabilities @xcite , that destroy the solutions .",
    "this is often a consequence of the failure to capture some essential physics of the continuum theory .    by applying some tools of algebraic topology and a discrete analog of differential forms ,",
    "classical electrodynamics can be constructed from first principles on a lattice @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that via such geometric discretization ,  the equality ( necessary , but often not trivially observed in common discretization schemes ) between the number of _",
    "dynamic _ degrees of freedom ( @xmath0 ) of the electric field and the number of _ dynamic _ @xmath0 of the magnetic field is a simple consequence  of euler s formula for a network of polygons for 2 + 1 case or volume polyhedra in the 3 + 1 case . as a by - product , this analysis also unveils a _ physical _ interpretation for euler s formula and a _ geometric _ interpretation for the hodge decomposition .",
    "for simplicity , we consider first a @xmath1 field in 2 + 1 dimensions . the extension to 3 + 1 dimensions",
    "is considered in section 3.2 .",
    "maxwell equations in the fourier domain are written in terms of differential forms as @xcite @xmath2 in the 2 + 1 case , @xmath3 is a 0-form , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are 1-forms , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are 2-forms .",

    "the latticization corresponds to tiling @xmath16 with a finite number @xmath20 of polygons @xmath21 , @xmath22 , of arbitrary shape(see fig.2 ) @xmath23we require the tiling to be _ conformal _ i.e. , two polygons are either connected by one single edge or are not connected at all ( see fig.3 ) .",

    "the exterior derivative @xmath9 can be discretized via its adjoint operator , the boundary operator , @xmath28 , by applying the generalized stoke s theorem on each @xmath13-cell of the cell - complex@xmath29where @xmath30 is a p+1 dimensional cell and @xmath31 , with @xmath32 being the space of differential forms ( cochains in the discrete setting ) of degree @xmath13 on the domain @xmath16 .",
