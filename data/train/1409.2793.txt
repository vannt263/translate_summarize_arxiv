    "the scattering of acoustic waves from an elastic cylindrical shell with internal structure is quite distinct from the response of a simple shell .",
    "excitation of waves on shells arises from two general mechanisms : ( i ) phase matching to supersonic membrane - type waves  @xcite , or ( ii ) excitation at structural discontinuities .",
    "the latter can excite both supersonic longitudinal waves which then re - radiate into the fluid , and subsonic flexural waves which can persist for long times and over large propagation paths on the structure .",
    "flexural waves are an important source of structural energy transfer , but they are not usually excited on a smooth metallic shell in contact with an exterior acoustic medium such as water because of their subsonic phase speed . the effect of structural discontinuities or constraints can be modeled as effective forces on an otherwise smooth shell , analyzed in the original work of bleich and baron @xcite .",
    "structural constraints can be separated into three fundamental types : concentrated , linear circumferential , and linear lengthwise .",
    "attachment of a spring - mass system or a beam to the interior surface of the shell constitutes a concentrated constraint .",
    "the constraint inhibits or enhances the vibration of the shell through reflection / conversion of structural waves as well as through the resonant behavior of the substructure itself .",
    "undersea vehicles are sometimes modeled as a shell with many spring - mass oscillators attached to the interior .",
    "analysis of such `` fuzzy structures '' indicates possible wave localization due to structural irregularity , which in turn suggests methods for controlling vibration / scattering @xcite .",
    "the other type of constraint , circumferential discontinuities , include examples such as rigid discs  @xcite , plates , rings  @xcite , ribs , bulkheads  @xcite , and any other frames thin in the axial direction .",
    "bloch - floquet waves and bragg scattering effects appear for oblique incidence if the internals are placed periodically along the axis of the shell ,  @xcite .",
    "analysis of oblique incidence onto shells with several bulkheads show that constructive interference between the scattered pressure due to each bulkhead produces a dipole - like radiation pattern and scattered pressure associated with bending moments yields a quadrupole - like radiation pattern @xcite .",
    "this paper is concerned with the two dimensional ( 2d ) modeling of lengthwise sheet springs supporting an internal mass as explored in  @xcite , which can be viewed as lengthwise discontinuities .",
    "more sophisticated and certainly more realistic models such as deck - type plates  @xcite and lengthwise elastic ribs  @xcite also fall into the category of lengthwise discontinuities .",
    "these internal structures provide more mechanisms for coupling to and mixing of the structure - borne waves producing a very complex response . with normal wave incidence and a sufficiently long shell ,",
    "lengthwise constraints can be analyzed in two dimensions as will be done herein .",
    "understanding of cause and effect can be obtained through detailed analysis of simple models for internal structure .",
    "the simplest model for internal structure is a single mass attached by a single spring to the shell .",
    "the structural analogue of this system is a long internal rod attached to the shell by a lengthwise rib .",
    "although springs can not support the passage of waves , this is a rich and relatively complex system as compared to the bare shell , and it displays many of the dynamic properties of much more complex substructures . the first such analysis by achenbach et al .",
    "@xcite considered the 2d problem of a shell with an internal mass supported by a single spring and loaded by an external point force . via an energy formulation the interaction force between the spring - mass system and the shell was determined and its affect on the acoustic scattering studied , especially in the vicinity of the spring - mass resonance .",
    "the presence of the substructure generates acoustic radiation which can be greater or lesser than that of the standalone shell based on the frequency of the harmonic excitation relative to the resonance of the oscillator ( spring - mass system ) .",
    "the problem becomes more complicated when the mass is supported by more than one spring .",
    "guo @xcite formulated the scattering solution for a shell with an internal mass attached by a diametrical pair of springs ( structural analogue being a rod supported by a diametric pair of lengthwise ribs ) .",
    "he demonstrated that there are two distinct solutions , for even and odd azimuthal modes , which superimpose to produce the overall response of the shell - springs - mass system .",
    "this simple model clearly reveals the rich and complex set of resonances resulting from flexural waves excited by the spring attachments .",
    "this stiffener - borne wave generation mechanism was investigated earlier by klauson and metsaveer @xcite .",
    "guo showed that the addition of a dissipative mechanism into the springs - mass system did little to the scattered field .",
    "later , gaunaurd @xcite expanded the analysis by considering a neutrally buoyant spherical shell with a double spring - mass system .",
    "spectral theory was used by ho @xcite to obtain the acoustic response for a shell with the mass supported by a non - diametrical pair of springs .",
    "the current work reconsiders simpler internal structural models , focusing on a distribution of an arbitrary number of @xmath0 springs supporting a central internal mass .",
    "this is an approximate 2d model of a central rod supported by an equally spaced distribution of @xmath0 lengthwise ribs .",
    "the model considered expands the existing results @xcite for masses attached by one or two springs , to the more general case of @xmath0 attachment springs , where @xmath2 is arbitrary . for an axisymmetric distribution of such springs",
    ", we utilize the symmetry of the problem to simplify the interaction force , which is later used to determine the t - matrix of the combined system .",
    "the results are presented successively for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and finally @xmath1 springs .",
    "the t - matrix is expressed in terms of physical quantities : acoustic , shell and spring impedance .",
    "these combine in a non - trivial way by virtue of the problem formulation to give the total impedance of the combined system .",
    "this total impedance governs the system s resonant behavior .",
