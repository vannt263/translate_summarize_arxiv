    "motivated from the discovery of the cosmic accelerated expansion of the universe@xcite , it is becoming important to test the nature of gravity on the cosmological scales .",
    "this is because the nature of gravity might be deeply rooted to the cosmic accelerated expansion ( e.g. , refs .  ) . in general",
    ", it is very challenging to construct a modified gravity ( mg ) theory that is consistent with observations . in comparison with the varieties of viable dark energy models to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe ,",
    "many modified gravity models are ruled out by cosmological observations ( e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "for example , one of the most popular modified gravity models is the dvali - gavadadze - porrati ( dgp ) model@xcite .",
    "the dgp model is described in the context of the braneworld scenario , which consists of a 3 + 1-dimensional brane embedded in a 5-dimensional bulk .",
    "this model has an interesting phenomenology and yields two branches of the friedmann equation , which are a self - accelerating branch ( sdgp ) and a normal branch ( ndgp ) . in the sdgp model ,",
    "the expansion of the universe self - accelerates at late times without a cosmological constant nor spatial curvature , while the ndgp model needs to add a stress - energy component with negative pressure on the brane to be consistent with cosmological observations .",
    "unfortunately , the sdgp model inevitably give rise to a ghost mode@xcite .",
    "moreover , the sdgp model is disfavored by the cosmological observations@xcite .    inspired by the decoupling limit of the dgp model , the galileon gravity theory has been studied as a possible alternative to large distance modification of gravity ( e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "this theory introduces a scalar field with the kinetic term with the  wrong  sign and the self - interaction term @xmath0 , which is invariant under the galilean shift symmetry @xmath1 in the minkowski space - time , which keeps equation of motion at the second order differential equation .",
    "although the lagrangian no longer satisfies the galilean shift symmetry in a curved spacetime , the field equation of the galileon field remains a second order differential equation , and the galileon field admits the self - accelerating solution in a frw universe without a ghost instability .",
    "the other notable feature of these modified gravity models is the vainshtein mechanism , which allows the modification of gravity to recover general relativity around a high density region@xcite .",
    "thanks to the vainshtein mechanism , these models evade the solar system constraint .",
    "it is worth examining whether or not the effect of modification of gravity on the nonlinear scales and the structure of the halo of galaxy or galaxy cluster might be useful as a clue to test these modified gravity theory .",
    "recently , several researchers have investigated such a possibility of testing these modified gravity models on the scales of galaxy or galaxy cluster@xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus our investigation on the structure of a halo in the sdgp model and the galileon model by constructing numerical solutions that correspond to the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) and the king model in the limit of newtonian gravity .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ mgmodel ] , we first give a brief review of the sdgp model and the galileon model .",
    "then , we give basic formulas for our halo models in the sdgp model and the galileon model . in sec .",
    "[ numericalresult ] , our numerical results of the halo models are demonstrated . in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] , we investigate the case with a different approach for the halo modeling , in which the halo density profile is fixed independently of the gravity model for comparison between our results and previous work@xcite . sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] is devoted to summary and conclusions . throughout this paper , we use units in which the speed of light equals unity , and we follow the metric convention @xmath2 .",
    "we use the reduce planck mass @xmath3 , which is defined by @xmath4 with newton s gravitational constant @xmath5 .",
    "we adopt the hubble constant @xmath6 with @xmath7 and the matter density parameter at present @xmath8 .",
    "the dvali - gabadadze - porrati model consists of a spatially three - dimensional brane in a 4 + 1 dimensional ( 5d ) minkowski bulk .",
    "the action is@xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 ( @xmath3 ) is the planck mass in the 5 ( 4 ) dimensional spacetime , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) are the determinant and the ricci scalar of the 5 ( 4 ) dimensional metric , respectively , and @xmath15 stands for the matter lagrangian .",
    "the two planck masses @xmath10 and @xmath3 can be related via length scale , the crossover scale @xmath16 , which must be fine - tuned to be the present - day horizon scales in order to modify gravity only at late times . in this model , the friedmann equation has two branches .",
    "one corresponds to the self - accelerating solution called sdgp , which contains a ghost - like instability .",
    "although the other solution called ndgp does not suffer from a ghost instability , the cosmological constant is needed to drive the cosmic acceleration . in the present paper",
    ", we consider the self - accelerating branch of the dgp model . during matter domination and beyond , the modified friedmann equation in the sdgp model is@xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the scale factor , and the matter density parameter",
    "is related to the crossover scale by @xmath19 .",
    "note that the modification of the law of gravity in the ndgp model is qualitatively similar to that in the galileon model .",
    "therefore , our results in the galileon model can be applied to the ndgp model .    on the other hand ,",
    "the galileon model is characterized by a scalar field with the self - interaction whose lagrangian is invariant under the galilean shift symmetry in the minkowski spacetime@xcite .",

    "observational constraints on this model is also investigated , focusing on the constraints from the ia supernovae ( sn ) observations and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) distance observation , as well as from the large scale structure of the luminous red galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 .",
    "the model with @xmath33 is disfavored by the constraints from the sn and cmb observations , however , the model with higher @xmath32 can be consistent with the observations . in the present paper , we consider the halo models of the galileon model with @xmath33 , however , the result is almost same as those with higher @xmath32 at a quantitative level .      in this subsection , we summarize basic perturbation equations for gravity and the brane bending mode in the sdgp model and the galileon field on small scales , assuming the spherically symmetric and static system . for convenience , we choose the newtonian gauge , which is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the scale factor , but we set @xmath36 in the expressions below , for simplicity . following refs .   and for the dgp model , and refs",

    "we investigated the effect of the modification of gravity with fixing the halo density profile independently of the gravity model . in this case , the circular speed is enhanced or decreased in the outer region of a halo depending on the gravity model . in the case adopting the nfw profile as a model of a cluster halo , the vainshtein radius is large .",
    "however , the vainshtein mechanism does not completely hide the effect of the modification of gravity in the cluster .",
    "this might provide a possible chance that precise measurement of halo could be a probe of the modified gravity , as discussed in ref .  .",

    "<S> we investigate the structure of halos in the sdgp ( self - accelerating branch of the dvali - gavadadze - porrati braneworld gravity ) model and the galileon modified gravity model on the basis of the static and spherically symmetric solutions of the collisionless boltzmann equation , which reduce to the singular isothermal sphere model and the king model in the limit of newtonian gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the common feature of these halos is that the density of a halo in the outer region is larger ( smaller ) in the sdgp ( galileon ) model , respectively , in comparison with newtonian gravity . </S>",
    "<S> this comes from the suppression ( enhancement ) of the effective gravity at large distance in the sdgp ( galileon ) model , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> however , the difference between these modified gravity models and newtonian gravity only appears outside the halo due to the vainshtein mechanism , which makes it difficult to distinguish between them . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the case in which the halo density profile is fixed independently of the gravity model for comparison between our results and previous work .    </S>"
