    "recently , the structure of the so called ` super ' carbon nanotubes ( sts ) was proposed @xcite ( figure 1 ) .",
    "this structure can be generated from an ordered carbon network based on the honeycomb symmetry , generically named super - graphene , which is heuristically constructed replacing the carbon - carbon bonds of the graphene architecture by single walled carbon nanotubes ( swcnts ) and the carbon atoms by y - like junctions .",

    "it can be applied to other tubular structures and to different symmetries through the use of other junction types ( x- or t - junctions , for example ) .",

    "the derived mechanical properties , such as young s modulus and tensile strength , were estimated for larger ( e.g. , higher - order ) sts using scaling laws related to the st fractal dimension @xcite . using these laws",
    "it was predicted that the material efficiency ( index of the optimization between strength and toughness ) presents a maximum when the zigzag st order is @xmath13 2 @xcite , which is similar to the case of nacre @xcite .",

    "the breaking strain does not necessarily characterize the full breaking of sts but indicates their first local rupture .",
    "figure 2 presents the results of the young s modulus obtained from atomistic calculations .",
    "we can see that the young s modulus of sts decreases with the increase of the st radius for fixed @xmath3 and @xmath14 values . this behavior can be expressed through the relation @xmath35 ( @xmath36}$ ] ) which reasonably fits the atomistic results as shown in figure 2 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath37 as being the radius of a given st . in table 1",
    "are presented the fitted values of the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 . the @xmath22 maximum value obtained was about 400 gpa for a [ 6,6]@(8,0 ) st . for a fixed value of @xmath40",
    ", @xmath22 increases with the increasing of the @xmath3 and @xmath14 values .",
    "these results indicate that the st stiffness can be increased by increasing the number of junctions ( varying @xmath3 and @xmath14 for a fixed radius ) . on the other hand ,",
    "st flexibility can be enhanced by increasing the length @xmath19 of the constituent swcnts . for sts formed with longer swcnts , the high bending flexibility of these swcnts",
    "is transfered to the behavior of sts .",
    "the mechanical behavior is similar to one presented by a fishing - net .",
    "it is relatively easy to deform the net up to a large elongation .",
    "this happens due to the flexibility of net arms and the small bending modulus at the junctions .",
    "the elongation occurs until the junction angles are in their maximum apertures .",
    "after this point the mechanical behavior is due to the mechanical properties of the ( stiff ) arms themselves .",
    "an investigation using finite element methods for ordered carbon nanotube networks formed by long swcnts ( length of 20 nm ) have revealed that such structures have indeed great flexibility @xcite .",
    "using our procedure for tensile tests the young s modulus for the ( 8,0 ) swcnt was about 850 gpa .",
    "this value is in agreement with values obtained in other theoretical simulations using brenner potential @xcite but it is about 15% smaller than the reference value of 1 tpa obtained for swcnts @xcite .",
    "thus , the absolute values derived for the mechanical properties of sts must be considered with caution and analyzed comparatively in terms of the values obtained for the constituent ( 8,0 ) swcnt .    ) as a function of the super carbon nanotube radius ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the points are results from atomistic calculations at 300 k and the lines represent the fitting of the points with the function @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath39 values are presented in table 1.,width=120 ]    .fitted values of the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 of the relation @xmath35 .",
    "the value of @xmath37 was adopted as being the smallest radius for each set of [ @xmath3,@xmath4@(8,0 ) sts considered .",
    "the error bars correspond to the standard deviations which are smaller than 3% . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the investigated sts presented fracture toughness of @xmath05 mpa  m@xmath42 , fracture energy of @xmath0100 n / m , and dissipated energy during tensile strain of @xmath05 kj / g . these values are comparatively about 5 , 8 , and 2 times smaller than the ones presented by the ( 8,0 ) swcnt at 300 k , respectively .",
    "we can also see that for sts these quantities are less sensitive to temperature increase than in the swcnt case .",
    "these results suggest that sts can be used in applications that require the maintenance of mechanical properties when high temperature variations are expected , such as fuselage protection for spacecrafts .",
    "recently carbon nanotube fibres comprising swcnts in a polymer matrix were produced showing a toughness of 570 j / g @xcite that is higher than the one presented by spider dragline silk ( 165 j / g @xcite ) , kevlar ( 33 j / g @xcite ) and graphite fibres ( 12 j / g @xcite ) . using the estimated reduction ( @xmath050 % ) of toughness presented by sts compared to ( 8,0",
    ") swcnts at 300 k ( table 3 ) we can roughly estimate a real toughness value for sts as @xmath0570/2 = 285 j / g . according to pugno @xcite , one of the most promising mechanical application of sts would be as multiscale fibre - reinforcements in tough matrices , mimicking bioinspired hierarchical materials , as bone , dentine ( both having 7 hierarchical levels ) or nacre ( 2 hierarchical levels ) .",
    "note that a st - based composite could be even more tough than the nanotube - based counterpart .",
    "this is mainly due to its multiscale topology , which could be able to activate toughening mechanisms and stop cracks at all the size - scales .",
    "this is observed in super - tough hierarchical biomaterials , such as bone , dentine or nacre .",
    "his analysis suggests that two - hierarchical levels sts would be the optimum for producing `` super''-composites ( as exhibited by nacre in nature ) .",
    "the optimization will be activated by the synergy between strong fibres and tough matrix , activating toughening ( e.g. , fibre pull - out ) mechanisms .",
    "therefore , our calculations , resulting in strengths of several gpa and toughness of @xmath0280 j / g , suggest that super - composites based on sts could be competitive with super - tough carbon nanotube fibres ( strength of 1.8 gpa and toughness of 570 j / g @xcite ) , spider silk ( strength of 1.8 gpa and toughness of 163 j / g @xcite ) , and kevlar ( strength of 3.6 gpa and toughness of 33 j / g @xcite ) even if longer fibres are expected to be weaker @xcite .",
    "atomistic simulations have been carried out only for ( 8,0 ) swcnts ( st@xmath6 ) , zigzag , armchair , and chiral sts ( st@xmath7 ) .",
    "however , the derived mechanical properties , such as young s modulus and tensile strength , can be estimated for higher - order self - similar sts , following the procedure proposed in @xcite , i.e. introducing appropriate scaling laws .",
    "in particular , the young s modulus @xmath22 for a st of radius @xmath40 is expected to scale according to @xmath43 @xcite , as confirmed by our fittings reported in figure 2 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "similarly , for the tensile strength @xmath44 we expect @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the so - called fractal exponent . from our atomistic simulations we found for @xmath46 the values of 1.94 and 2.27 for [ 4,0]@(8,0 ) st at 300 k and 1000 k or 0.57 and 0.74 for [ 4,4]@(8,0 ) st at 300 k and 1000 k , respectively . for a self - similar st of hierarchy @xmath47 , the strength or young s modulus @xmath48 scales , as a first approximation , as @xmath49 ( the subscript 0 refers to a swcnt ) , where @xmath50 is the cross - sectional area fraction of st of order @xmath51 in a st of order @xmath8 ( = 1,@xmath52,@xmath47 ) @xcite .",
    "for example , according to our atomistic simulations at 300 k , we find for the self - similar [ 4,0]@(8,0 ) st@xmath53 , having first - order radius of 2.72 nm , a value for the strength of 68 gpa and for the young s modulus of 57 gpa ; for a self - similar [ 4,4]@(8,0 ) st@xmath53 , having first - order radius of 4.74 nm , values for the strength of 33 gpa and for the young s modulus of 89 gpa are computed .",
    "the scaling laws we are invoking here are of geometrical nature , thus they are valid , in principle , for all the hierarchical levels , if the related geometries are considered .",
    "our derived predictions for the st@xmath53 are based on the hypothesis of geometrical self - similarity , i.e. , the number and cross - sectional area fraction of swcnts inside the st@xmath7 are the same of those of st@xmath7s inside the studied st@xmath53 .",
    "the mechanical properties of the so - called ` super ' carbon nanotubes ( sts ) are investigated using classical molecular dynamics simulations based on reactive empirical bond - order potential . from tensile tests of impact loads",
    ", we have found that sts are more flexible than the swcnt used to form them but , in some cases , they show comparable tensile strengths .",
    "the sts young s modulus have been predicted to have an inverse proportionality with the st radius . during tensile deformations",
    "the shape and aperture of pores in st sidewalls can be modified providing a way to vary the accessible channels to the inner parts of sts through the application of mechanical loads .",
    "the st rupture occurs basically at regions near the swcnt junctions and it is influenced by the st chirality .",
    "the investigated sts presented values of fracture toughness , fracture energy , and dissipated energy that are about 5 , 8 , and 2 times smaller than the ones presented by the constituent ( 8,0 ) swcnt , respectively .",
    "based on the predicted geometrical and mechanical properties , sts may represent new candidates for novel porous , flexible , and high - strength materials .",
    "the value of young s modulus depends on the definition of thickness @xmath54 of swcnts .",
    "there is no defined convention for @xmath54 since the definition of the cross - sectional area for swcnts can be problematic .",
    "for example , values as 3.4  @xcite and 0.66 - 0.75  @xcite have been used . as we are theoretically estimating the mechanical properties of sts we have used here the value of 3.4  , following the convention of belytschko _ et al . _",
