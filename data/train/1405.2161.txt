    "in study of an oriented surfaces , the goldman lie algebra plays an important role .",
    "goldman @xcite defined a lie bracket on the free @xmath0-module with basis the set of conjugacy classes in the fundamental group of the oriented surface .",
    "the bracket corresponds to the poisson bracket of smooth functions on the representation space of the fundamental group .",
    "this is called the goldman lie bialgebra .",
    "turaev @xcite found that the goldman lie bialgebra has the structure of a lie algebra , which is called the goldman - turaev lie algebra .",
    "furthermore turaev @xcite showed that the skein algebra of links in the cylinder over an oriented surface quantizes the goldman - turaev lie bialgebra on the surface .",
    "gadgil @xcite showed that a homotopy equivalence between compact oriented surfaces with non - empty boundary is homotopic to a homeomorphism if and only if it commutes with the goldman lie bracket .",
    "kawazumi and kuno @xcite found that goldman lie algebra acts on the group ring of fundamental group and that the action induces more detailed structures on the goldman lie algebra .    on a non - orientable surface",
    "the local intersection number can be defined only over fields whose characteristic is 2 .",
    "for example , in kawazumi - kuno @xcite @xcite and massuyeau - turaev @xcite the quantity @xmath1 gives the logarithm of the dehn twist along the simple closed curve @xmath2 on an oriented surface , but we ca nt define it on a non - orientable surface . in this paper , we introduce a lie subalgebra of the goldman lie algebra on the orientation cover with coefficients in a commutative ring containing the rationals @xmath3 and the action of the lie subalgebra on the group ring of fundamental group of the non - orientable surface .",
    "the action can be quantized in the sense of turaev @xcite . as an application",
    ", we deduce an explicit formula of the dehn twists along an annulus simple closed curve on the surface as in kawazumi and kuno @xcite . on a non - orientable surface ,",
    "the annulus simple closed curve dehn twists generate the subgroup of the mapping class group consisting of elements whose determinant of the action on the first homology group is 1 , as was proved by lickorish @xcite .",
