    "the underlying intrinsic x - ray continua of agns without apparent deep absorption usually show a power - law form with a typical photon index of @xmath5 .",
    "there is some dispersion in the spectral indices , however .",
    "for example , narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1 ) are known to have intrinsically softer spectra , with up to @xmath6 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "agns with apparently much harder spectra usually arises from some reprocessing , i.e. , absorption ( by neutral or partially ionized gas ) and/or compton - reflection .",
    "these reprocessing leaves some characteristic features , which are sometimes hard to recognize in x - ray spectra with low signal - to - noise ratio .    as a part of our study of a complete determination of spectral properties of a hard x - ray selected bright agns using _ asca _ and _ xmm - newton _",
    "@xcite , the primary goal of which is to serve as a bright - end constraint to hard x - ray luminosity function , evolution , and x - ray agn population synthesis studies ( e.g. ueda et al . in preparation ) , we have observed a radio - quiet qso ( rqq ) kaz 102 ( a.k.a .",

    "asca_. the results of the study of the whole sample will be reported elsewhere ( miyaji et al . in preparation ) .",
    "kaz 102 is an optically - bright rqq at @xmath7 with broad lines ( h@xmath1 fwhm @xmath8 @xcite and was already recognized as a very hard x - ray source with a photon index of @xmath9 , when it was observed by the _ einstein observatory _ in 1979 @xcite .",
    "however , during the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) in july 1990- january 1991 , the spectral index in the _ rosat _ band was much softer ( @xmath10 ) , which was typical of an rqq in the rosat band @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we report the unusual spectral properties of this object during our _ asca _ observation .",
    "luminosities are calculated using @xmath11 kms@xmath12mpc@xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the asca observation was made during the asca ao7 period as a part of our larger program ( see above ) .",
    "the log of observation of kaz 102 is shown in table [ tab : log ] .",
    "data reduction and extraction of events have been made using * ftools 5.0 * or later and spectral fittings have been made using * xspec 11.2*.       the third explanation is the change of ionization state of the warm absorber .",
    "if the central source was twice as luminous , i.e. @xmath3 increased to 400 ( the absorber temperature increases accordingly ) , the absorber becomes more transparent at @xmath15 kev , reproducing the steep spectrum of the _ rosat _ observation .",
    "however , in the case of kaz 102 , this is not a likely explanation , because the entire spectrum had to be twice as luminous when _ rosat _ observed the soft excess component . it might be possible , however , that _ rosat _",
    "observation was made just after the irradiating source had become fainter , but the absorber retains the previous ionization state .",
    "this is not likely the case unless the cloud is located just at the geometrical constraint threshold of @xmath16 cm with @xmath17 @xmath18 ( table [ tab : cloud ] ) .",
    "the reason is that @xcite detected no significant variability of the soft x - ray flux ( @xmath19% if any ) during the repeated _ rosat _ all - sky survey scans through kaz 102 over @xmath20 days , except for a sign of two brief dips . and the recombination timescale estimated by eq .",
    "( 2 ) of @xcite is @xmath21 s , which become comparable or longer than this timescale only if density is @xmath22 @xmath18 , hence @xmath23 cm .    in order to discriminate between the discussed possibilities of the origins of the hard x - ray spectrum and the variability of the soft component , further x - ray observations , including detailed spectral variability study and high resolution spectroscopy such as obtainable with gratings on chandra / xmm - newton and the calorimeter on astro - e2",
    "are needed . after characterizing the physical nature of the object , one can answer the most important question :  why such agns are so rare ?",
    "is it just an extreme case of continuous population of type 1 agns with warm absorber or is there something essentially different about kaz 102 ?  .",
