    "two - dimensional curvature model of helfrich and polakov as well as that of nambu and goto has been extensively studied as a model of membranes and of strings from the viewpoints of two - dimensional differential geometry and statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "because of their two - dimensional nature , these models have a variety of surface shapes and the corresponding shape transformations or phase transitions , which can be considered to represent the complexity of real physical membranes @xcite .    among the interesting topics on those models ,",
    "the surface crumpling phenomenon is an old topic that has long been studied from several perspectives @xcite .",
    "the phase transition of such crumpling phenomena is itself an interesting topic in biological and artificial membranes .",
    "experimental investigations show that such phenomena can be seen in an artificial membrane @xcite . in the string model context",
    "the path integration of the model describes the sum over surfaces in @xmath4 @xcite , and therefore it seems that the summation technology changes depending on whether the surfaces are smooth or crumpled .",
    "the crumpling phenomena can also be seen in thin sheets .",
    "the universal structure was found in the formations of singularity in ridges and cones on those crumpled sheets @xcite . moreover ,",
    "if the transition is of second - order , the phenomena can be linked to a universal model for two - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "thus , extensive numerical studies on the phase transition have been made on triangulated surfaces @xcite , including self - avoiding ones @xcite .",
    "recent numerical studies show that the conventional surface model has a first - order surface fluctuation transition on triangulated fixed - connectivity spheres @xcite , and moreover , that the surface collapsing phenomena occur at the same transition point ; the collapsing transition is considered to be a first - order transition .",
    "on the other hand , the conventional homogeneous surface model mentioned above can be extended to an inhomogeneous one by including a cytoskeletal structure @xcite .",
    "in fact , the phase structure of skeleton models is partly understood @xcite .",
    "the numerical results show that the phase structure of the surface fluctuation phenomenon in the fixed - connectivity conventional surface model remains almost unchanged even when the compartmentalized structure was introduced @xcite . on the contrary , in a dynamically triangulated fluid surface model",
    "the phase structure considerably changes if the free diffusion of vertices is confined inside the compartments , which are introduced as an inhomogeneous structure @xcite .",
    "the compartmentalized models are those defined on a triangulated lattice with a cytoskeletal structure , which is a sublattice .",
    "thus , the compartmentalized model is defined by using the lattice (= the surface ) and the sublattice (= the cytoskeleton ) , because the one - dimensional bending energy is defined on the sublattice and the gaussian bond potential is defined all over the lattice including the sublattice .",
    "therefore , it is natural to ask whether the surface shape is maintained only by the cytoskeletal structure .",
    "the problem which we consider is whether it is possible to eliminate the surface from the compartmentalized surface or not",
    ". if this is possible , then we are interested in whether the resulting model is well defined or not in the sense that the two - dimensional surface structure remains unchanged .",
    "moreover , it is also interesting to see whether the phase structure remains unchanged when the surface is eliminated .",
    "following to these considerations , we studied a meshwork model in @xcite and reported some preliminary results on the phase structure . in this paper",
    ", we study two types of meshwork models including the one in @xcite on relatively large sized surfaces . the first model in this paper is characterized by elastic junctions and is identical to the model in @xcite , while the second model is characterized by rigid junctions , which are hexagonal ( or pentagonal ) rigid plates .",
    "we will see a first - order transition of surface - collapsing phenomena in both models .",
    "with respect to surface - fluctuations , the first model undergoes a first - order transition , while the second model a second - order transition .",
    "thus , our results show that the phase structure of meshwork model is weakly dependent on the elasticity at the junctions .",
    "the hausdorff dimension @xmath1 of the surface can be defined by using the mean square size @xmath5 and the total number of vertices @xmath6 such that @xmath7 .",
    "it will also be shown that @xmath8 in the smooth phase , and that @xmath1 remains in the physical bound , i.e. , @xmath3 , even in the collapsed phase in both models .",
    "thus , the first model in this paper has almost the same phase structure as that of the fixed - connectivity conventional surface model @xcite . on the contrary , the phase structure of the second model is slightly different from the fixed - connectivity conventional model because of the continuous transition of surface fluctuation .",
    "the meshwork , as mentioned in the introduction , is constructed as compartments on the triangulated spherical surfaces by eliminating vertices , bonds , and triangles inside the compartments .",
    "thus , the triangulated surfaces for constructing the meshwork are identical to the lattices for the surface models in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the size of meshwork can be characterized by the expression similar to the one for those compartmentalized surface models in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath6 be the total number of vertices , @xmath9 the total number of vertices on the chains , and @xmath10 the total number of junctions .",

    "both models are defined on meshworks , which are composed of linear chains and junctions ; no two - dimensional surface is included in the meshwork except at the junctions . the first model , denoted by model 1 , is characterized by elastic junctions , which are composed of vertices , bonds and triangles , and the shape of the elastic junctions is of hexagonal and of pentagonal .",
