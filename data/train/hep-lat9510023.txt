    "in qcd an important role is played by topological properties . by the axial anomaly ,",
    "matrix elements or correlation functions involving the topological charge density operator @xmath2 can be related to relevant quantities of hadronic phenomenology .",
    "we mention the topological susceptibility @xmath3 , which is determinant in the explanation of the @xmath4 problem  @xcite , and the on - shell nucleon matrix element of @xmath2 , which can be related to the so - called spin content of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "lattice techniques represent our best source of non - perturbative calculations , however investigating the topological properties of qcd on the lattice is a non - trivial task . in a lattice theory",
    "the field is defined on a discretized set and therefore the associated topological properties are strictly trivial .",
    "one relies on the fact that the physical continuum topological properties should be recovered in the continuum limit .    from a field",
    "theoretical point of view , i.e. considering the lattice as a regulator , difficulties may come from unphysical divergences proportional to powers of the cut - off , which must be removed and therefore make the extraction of the physical signal hard . in order to get reliable quantitative estimates of physical quantities , one should control the unphysical cut - off dependent corrections even when they disappear in the continuum limit , given that numerical simulations are performed at finite lattice spacings , i.e. at finite values of the cut - off .",
    "such corrections may be relevant , in that the typical values of the bare coupling @xmath5 where simulations are usually performed are actually not small , but @xmath6 , thus few terms in perturbation theory are not always reliable .    considering a lattice version of @xmath2 , @xmath7 ,",
    "the classical continuum limit must be in general corrected by including a renormalization function . in pure qcd , where @xmath2 is renormalization group invariant , @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a finite function of the bare coupling @xmath5 going to one in the limit @xmath10 , but at @xmath6 it may be very different from one .",
    "the finite renormalization of the widely used lattice operator  @xcite @xmath11\\;\\ , \\label{stop}\\ ] ] ( @xmath12 is the product of link variables @xmath13 around a @xmath14 plaquette ) is quite nonnegligible : for @xmath15 @xmath16  @xcite .    the relation of the zero - momentum correlation of two @xmath7 operators @xmath17 with the topological susceptibility @xmath3 is further complicated by an unphysical background term , which eventually becomes dominant in the continuum limit .",
    "( we recall that the definition of @xmath3 requires also a prescription to define the product of operators  @xcite . )",
    "indeed @xmath18 neglecting terms @xmath19 , the background term @xmath20 can be written in terms of mixings with the unity operator ( so - called perturbative tail scaling as @xmath21 ) and with the trace of the energy - momentum ( scaling as @xmath22 ) . in the case of the operator ( [ stop ] ) and for @xmath15 , @xmath20 is already dominant at @xmath6 : it is about 85% of @xmath23 at @xmath24  @xcite . as a consequence the uncertainty on @xmath3 can be hardly made smaller than @xmath25 by using the operator ( [ stop ] ) and the heating method to evaluate @xmath9 and @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "another problem , which has come up in some studies concerning the lattice determination of the on - shell proton matrix element of @xmath2  @xcite , is that the lattice operator ( [ stop ] ) is very noisy , requiring very accurate statistics and therefore expensive simulations in order to get a reasonable uncertainty on the final result . in view of a full qcd lattice calculation",
    "the search for a better estimator appears a necessary step .",
    "we study , within the field theoretical approach , the possibility of improving the lattice estimator of @xmath2 with respect to all the problems listed above , that is we look for local versions of @xmath2 which are less noisy , have a multiplicative renormalization closer to one , and whose corresponding @xmath23 is not dominated by the unphysical backgroung signal @xmath20 in the region @xmath6 .",
    "( any @xmath23 defined from a local @xmath7 will eventually be dominated by its perturbative tail in the continuum limit . for the purpose of evaluating @xmath3 it would suffice to have a small tail at @xmath6 , which should be already in the scaling region . )",
    "inspired by the widely used smearing techniques , we consider the following set of operators defined in terms of smeared links @xmath26 : @xmath27 , \\label{impop}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the product of smeared links @xmath26 around a @xmath14 plaquette .",
    "such smeared links are constructed by the following procedure : @xmath29^{1/2 } } \\label{imppr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 and therefore @xmath32 depend on the parameter @xmath33 , which can be tuned to optimize the properties of @xmath32 .",
    "all these operators have the correct classical continuum limit , i.e. for @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "notice that the size of @xmath32 increases with increasing the integer parameter @xmath36 .",
    "nevertheless @xmath32 can be still considered as local operators when keeping @xmath36 fixed while approaching the continuum limit .",
    "also , as we shall see , by optimizing the choice of the parameter @xmath33 , a good improvement with respect to @xmath37 is already achieved for small values of @xmath36 .",
    "for @xmath38 the procedure ( [ imppr ] ) keeps the smeared links @xmath31 belonging to the @xmath38 group , and it is equivalent to the smearing procedures proposed in ref .  @xcite . for @xmath39",
    "the smeared links no longer belong to the @xmath40 group .",
    "the procedure ( [ imppr ] ) may be used to improve any local operator involving link variables .",
    "smearing methods to improve lattice estimators have been already widely employed in the study of long distance correlations , such as large wilson loops and hadron source operators .",
    "one often adopts an equivalent `` schrdinger picture '' of smearing , whereby lattice operators retain their original definition , while all links in the configuration undergo transformation ( [ imppr ] )",
    ". full consistency of this picture would then require that @xmath31 be unitary .",
    "( as it stands , @xmath31 is only unitary in the case of @xmath38 . )",
    "projecting a matrix v onto @xmath40 amounts to finding @xmath41 which minimizes @xmath42 , or equivalently maximizes @xmath43 .",
    "the solution is given by : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the real root of the equation : @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the eigenvalues of @xmath48 .",
    "it can be verified that the lower loop results for @xmath9 and the perturbative tail @xmath49 ( see sec .",
    "[ pertan ] ) are not modified by rendering @xmath31 unitary as above .",
    "it is worth mentioning at this point that abrupt cooling leads to exactly the same unitary links @xmath50 , for @xmath51 . indeed",
    ", cooling reassigns to each link a new value , @xmath52 in a way as to minimize the action , i.e. maximize : @xmath53 at @xmath51 , which coincides with eq.([unitary ] ) .    for @xmath39 , instead of projecting back onto the @xmath40 group",
    "we propose last step of the procedure ( [ imppr ] ) , which is simpler and should retain most of the advantages of the standard smearing procedure .",
    "we have calculated @xmath54 to one loop for the once - smeared operator @xmath55 with the wilson action . to carry out this calculation ,",
    "@xmath56 is expanded in a taylor series in the gauge field @xmath57 , where @xmath58 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the three diagrams contributing to @xmath59 .",
    "we find @xmath60 \\ ; , \\label{mr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 .",
    "at @xmath62 we recover the non - smeared results  @xcite : @xmath63 which do not lead to a reliable estimate of @xmath64 . as @xmath33 varies , the following extreme values of @xmath65 are obtained : @xmath66 in both cases , @xmath65 is quite close to unity for typical values of @xmath5 , making the one loop estimate more reliable .",
    "it is noteworthy that the last step in the smearing procedure ( [ imppr ] ) turns out to be essential to make @xmath65 approach one for @xmath67 .    for @xmath55",
    ", we have also calculated the lowest perturbative contribution to the mixing with the unity operator @xmath49 , which is the dominant part of the background term @xmath20 in the continuum limit .",
    "the corresponding diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and leads to the result : @xmath68 the minimum of this everywhere - concave polynomial is @xmath69 .",
    "thus , for all @xmath70 , the leading order of @xmath49 diminishes by more than two orders of magnitude compared to its non - smeared value ( @xmath62 ) .    in the presence of dynamical fermions",
    "one should take into account the fact that , unlike pure gauge theory , the topological charge density mixes under renormalization with @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the singlet axial current .",
    "the nonrenormalizability property of the anomaly in the @xmath73 scheme means that the anomaly equation should take exactly the same form in terms of bare or renormalized quantities",
    ". however the renormalization of @xmath74 and @xmath2 is nontrivial  @xcite .",
    "a renormalization group analysis leads to the following relation valid for all matrix elements of a lattice version @xmath7 of @xmath2 in the chiral limit  @xcite : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a finite function of @xmath5 , and @xmath77 is a renormalization group invariant quantity ; @xmath78 indicates the operator @xmath79 renormalized in the @xmath73 scheme , and the function @xmath80 is related to the anomalous dimension of the continuum operators @xmath2 , @xmath81 in the @xmath73 scheme : @xmath82 . notice that @xmath83 is what can be naturally extracted also from experimental data .    in perturbation theory one finds @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the coefficient of the @xmath86 term of the finite renormalization of @xmath87 in the pure gauge theory ( cfr .",
    "( [ mr ] ) ) , and @xmath88 turns out to be a small number : @xmath89 for @xmath90 and @xmath91  @xcite .",
    "estimates of the multiplicative renormalizations of the operators @xmath32 and of the background term in the corresponding @xmath23 can be obtained using the numerical heating method  @xcite , without any recourse to perturbation theory .",
    "this method relies on the idea that the multiplicative renormalization @xmath9 and the background term @xmath20 is produced by short ranged fluctuations at the scale of the cut - off @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , when using a standard local algorithm ( for example metropolis or heat bath ) to reach statistical equilibrium , the modes contributing to @xmath65 and @xmath93 should not suffer from critical slowing down , unlike global quantities , such as the topological charge , which should experience a severe form of critical slowing  @xcite .",
    "we applied the heating method to the operators @xmath32 for @xmath94 and for a number of values of @xmath33 in the region @xmath95 .",
    "we restricted our analysis to the @xmath38 pure gauge theory , expecting no substantial differences for @xmath90 .",
    "the measurements were performed at @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) , which is a typical value for the @xmath38 simulations with the wilson action .",
    "the local updating was performed using the heat - bath algorithm .",
    "an estimate of @xmath65 can be obtained by heating a configuration @xmath98 which is an approximate minimum of the lattice action and carries a definite topological charge @xmath99 .",
    "such a configuration has been constructed by discretizing an instanton solution in the singular gauge @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 , and exponentiating it to define link variables @xmath103 . then a few cooling steps ( about 5 )",
    "were performed to make the configuration smoother . on a lattice @xmath104 and choosing @xmath105 we obtained an instanton - like configuration carrying a topological charge @xmath106 ( all improved operators we considered gave approximately the same value for @xmath98 ) .",
    "one then constructs ensembles @xmath107 of many independent configurations obtained by heating @xmath98 for the same number @xmath108 of updating steps , averaging @xmath109 over @xmath110 at fixed @xmath108 .",
    "let us define @xmath111 , i.e. the average on the ensemble @xmath107 .",
    "fluctuations of length @xmath112 contributing to @xmath65 should rapidly thermalize , while the topological structure of the initial configuration is left ( approximately ) unchanged for a long time .",
    "after a few heating steps where the short ranged modes contributing to @xmath65 get thermalized , @xmath113 should show a plateau approximately at @xmath114 .",
    "the estimates of @xmath115 from the plateaux observed in the heating procedure are reported in table  [ tab1 ] , and should be compared with the value @xmath116 for the standard operator ( [ stop ] )  @xcite .",

    "[ zeta ] , where data for @xmath94 and @xmath119 are plotted versus @xmath108 .",
    "checks of the stability of the background topological structure of the initial configuration were performed at @xmath120 by cooling back the configurations ( locally minimizing the action ) finding @xmath121 after few cooling steps .",
    "this analysis confirms the one - loop perturbative calculations , that is the improved operators we considered have a multiplicative renormalization closer to one than that of the initial operator @xmath7 . from @xmath122 of @xmath7 ,",
    "we pass , by roughly optimizing with respect to the parameter @xmath33 , to @xmath123 by one improving step , and @xmath124 by two improving steps . for larger @xmath36",
    "we expect to get @xmath125 closer and closer to one , as also suggested from the results of the cooling method  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we should not forget that increasing the number of improving steps the size of the operator @xmath32 increases .",
    "one should find a reasonable compromise taking into account the size of the lattice one can afford in the simulations .",
    "a comparison of the above results for @xmath126 with the one - loop calculation ( [ mr ] ) shows that the contribution of the higher perturbative orders is still non - negligible , but not so relevant as in the case of the operator without improving .",
    "another important property of the improved operators we can infer from the heating method results is that they are much less noisy than @xmath7 at fixed background . in other words , in the monte carlo determinations of the matrix elements of @xmath2 the contribution of short ranged fluctuations to the error is largely suppressed . a quantitative idea of",
    "this fact may come from the quantity @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the typical error of the data in the plateau during the heating procedure described above .",
    "we indeed found for @xmath129 and for an equal number of measurements @xmath130    an estimate of the background signal @xmath20 can be obtained by measuring @xmath131 on ensembles of configurations @xmath132 constructed by heating the flat configuration for the same number @xmath108 of updating steps  @xcite .",
    "measurements were performed on a @xmath133 lattice .",
    "the plateau showed after few heating steps ( @xmath134 in this case ) by the data of @xmath135 should be placed approximately at the value of @xmath136 , since no topological activity is detected there , i.e. the background is still flat ( this is checked by cooling back the heated configurations ) , while the other modes contributing to @xmath20 should be already approximately thermalized ( for a discussion of this issue see @xcite ) .",
    "the estimates of @xmath137 from the plateaux observed during heating are given in table  [ tab2 ] , and should be compared with the value @xmath138 relative to the standard operator ( [ stop ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ tail ] we plot @xmath139 for @xmath94 and @xmath140 as a function of the heating step @xmath108 , and compare with the corresponding data for the standard operator .",
    "the expected plateaux are observed from @xmath134 .",
    "notice the strong suppression of the background term in the improved operators . for @xmath141",
    "the reduction is about a factor 8 when performing one improving step , and about a factor 30 by two improving steps . for a larger number of improving steps",
    ", the suppression is expected to be larger .    the suppression of the background term in eq .",
    "( [ chileq ] ) together with the relevant increase of @xmath65 should drastically change the relative weights of the contributions to @xmath23 in the relevant region for monte carlo simulations . by a standard monte carlo simulation at @xmath96 on a @xmath142 lattice , we measured @xmath143 for @xmath94 and @xmath144 .",
    "we performed 15000 sweeps using an overrelaxed algorithm ; this sample size is already sufficient to show the better properties of the operators @xmath32 .",
    "data for @xmath145 are given in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "for comparison we also calculated @xmath146 by cooling  @xcite .",
    "for the standard operator we found @xmath147 , which , due to the large corresponding background term @xmath148 , does not allow one to determine @xmath146 at this value of @xmath149 .",
    "instead the improved operators @xmath32 provide , using eq .",
    "( [ chileq ] ) , reliable estimates of @xmath146 having about 10% of uncertainty , which are consistent with each other and are also consistent with the determination from cooling : @xmath150 , although the latter seems to be systematically lower .",
    "this fact may be explained taking into account that @xmath151 , which is used to estimate the topological charge of cooled configurations , underestimates the topological charge content ( for the lattice size we are working with ) , as we found out explicitly when we constructed an instanton configuration on the lattice .",
    "the determinations of @xmath65 and @xmath93 should not be subject to relevant finite size scaling effects ( as explictly checked in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , since they have their origin in short ranged fluctuations .",
    "thus finite size corrections to our estimates of @xmath65 and @xmath93 should be negligible .",
    "larger finite size effects are expected on the topological modes , as can be argued from numerical studies available in the literature .",
    "for this reason the measurement of @xmath23 , which receives contributions also from topological modes , was performed on a larger lattice .",
    "we should say that we did not perform a complete analysis of the finite size corrections to @xmath23 , since our purpose was just to show the better behavior of the improved operators @xmath32 and not the determination of @xmath3 for the @xmath38 gauge model .",
    "so we limited ourselves to a numerical study not requiring a super - computer .",
    "if the improvement for @xmath15 is similar to that achieved for @xmath38 , using the optimal operator for @xmath152 at @xmath24 the unphysical term in eq .",
    "( [ chileq ] ) is expected to become a small part of the total signal , allowing a precise determination of @xmath3 by the field theoretical method .",
    "we have analyzed the properties of a class of improved lattice topological charge density operators constructed by a smearing - like procedure .",
    "such operators look promising for the lattice calculation of the on - shell proton matrix element of the topological charge density operator in full qcd , which is related to the so - called proton spin content .",
    "indeed their use should overcome the difficulty due to the large noise observed in preliminary quenched studies  @xcite , and they have a multiplicative renormalization much closer to one .",
    "improved operators are also expected to provide a much better determination of the topological susceptibility by the field theoretical method in the @xmath15 gauge theory , by strongly reducing the unphysical background term while enhancing the term containing @xmath3 with larger values of the multiplicative renormalization .",
    "this should allow a precise and independent check of the alternative cooling method determinations ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) , whose systematic errors are not completely controlled .",
    "furthermore the improved operators may also open the road to a more reliable lattice investigation of the behavior of the topological susceptibility at the deconfinement transition , where cooling does not give satisfactory results  @xcite .    the smearing - like procedure ( [ imppr ] )",
    "may be used to improve any local operator involving link variables , and a renormalization study would again be called for in all cases .",
