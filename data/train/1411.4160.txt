    "in order to unveil the full extent of the complexity of real social , technological , and biological systems , it is important to consider networks of networks , i.e. multilayer structures formed by interaction between different networks @xcite .",
    "real - world networks @xcite rarely live in isolation , and technological systems such as infrastructures , or biological systems such as a single cell or the brain can not be fully understood if the multilayer perspective is not taken into account .",
    "recent results @xcite on the robustness of multilayer networks pose new challenge for the design of better infrastructures where the effect of random damage and the risk of dramatic avalanches of failures can be reduced .",
    "a pivotal role in this respect has been played by the observation that multilayer networks might be structurally more fragile than single layers and prone to dramatic avalanches of cascading failures @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the robustness of a multilayer network can be characterized by evaluating the size of the _ mutually connected giant component _ of these networks as a function of the probability of the initially inflicted damage to the network .",
    "it has been found that on multilayer networks , critical phenomena @xcite can show surprising new physics .",
    "in fact , differently from the giant component of a single network , the mutually connected component emerges discontinuously at a hybrid transition , combining discontinuity and singularity , and close to this transition the system can be affected by global cascades o failures  @xcite .",
    "this result is not only interesting from the theoretical point of view , but it also raises some questions concerned to the robustness of multilayer biological networks , that would not have survived the evolutionary pressure if they were so fragile @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example , the case of multilayer brain network was considered and key structural correlation of the network have been detected responsible for restoring the robustness of biological networks .    while most of the results @xcite concerning the emergence of the mutually connected component regard multiplex networks @xcite , i.e. networks in which the same set of nodes interact through different layers , here we consider the case of networks of networks @xcite in which the nodes in the different sub networks ( layers ) are different entities . for example , a network of networks can be formed by interacting power - grid and the internet in which the nodes are power - plants and routers , or in biology a network of networks can be formed by interacting protein  protein interaction networks , transcription networks , or metabolic networks where the nodes represent different molecules .",
    "several results were already obtained for the robustness of networks of networks @xcite . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the emergence of the mutually connected component might depend on the presence of loops of interdependencies between layers . in ref .",
    "@xcite we focused on the networks of networks in which each node has its replica nodes in all other layers , and only the replica nodes can be interdependent , see fig .",
    "[ f1]a , c . in the present work",
    "we relax this constraint , which allowed interdependencies only between replica nodes , and study networks of networks in which there is no replica nodes , and random nodes in pairs of layers can be interdependent , see fig .",
    "clearly , in the absence of loops of interdependencies , the latter network of networks is readily reduced to the super tree from ref .",
    "@xcite , in which super nodes are different layers , with interdependent replica nodes . on the other hand ,",
    "the networks of networks with random matching of nodes in different layers can not be reduced to already considered models if these networks of networks contain loops of interdependencies .",
    "this is the case of our particular interest .",
    "here we provide an exhaustive account of the robustness of networks of networks , stressing the role of interlinks ( links between nodes of different layers , that is interdependencies ) in determining the emergence of the mutually connected component .",
    "in particular , we compare the model of a network of networks proposed by gao et al .",
    "@xcite with the case of a network of networks in which , in contrast to the work of gao et al .",
    "@xcite , each node can only link to a replica node in the other layer @xcite , and we show that the difference the ensembles of networks of networks dramatically changes the nature of the percolation transition .",
    "we confirm the result of gao et al .",
    "@xcite that the robustness of networks of networks without replica nodes depends on the loop structure of the super network ( the network of interdependencies between the layers ) while this phenomenon is not observed in the networks of networks with replica nodes .",
    "we also show that the mutually connected component can be subjected to multiple phase transitions instead of a single one .",
    "in particular in the case of a random super network in which each layer has a given superdegree ( number of interlinks of the nodes of a layer ) there are multiple phase transitions corresponding to the activation / deactivation of layers of different superdegrees . at each of these transitions ,",
    "a finite fraction of nodes in layers of specific superdegree join the giant mutually connected component .",
    "in particular we find that in this case layers with high superdegree @xmath0 are more fragile than layers with lower superdegree .",
    "this is quite opposite to what occurs in single networks where nodes of high degree are more robust in the sense that they are typically the last ones to be separated from the giant connected component by random damaging .",
    "this puzzle can be easily explained .",
    "indeed , in a single network one node is active if at least one linked node is active , giving more robustness to high degree nodes .",
    "in contrast to this , in interdependent networks a node in one layer is active only if all the nodes interdependent on it in the other layers are also active , making the nodes in the layers with high superdegree more fragile .",
    "the multiple percolation phase transitions were previously observed in the configuration model of a network of networks @xcite , fig .",
    "[ f1]c , where , as in the present work , layers with many interdependencies turned out to be more fragile than layers with less interdependencies .",
    "one should notice that multiple phase transitions have been recently observed in percolation problems for networks with nontrivial clustering or with communities @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the reason for the multiple phase transitions is specific percolation in a system of layers in a network of networks , which differs principally from these works .",

    "let us apply the cavity method ( message passing equations approach ) @xcite to our problem .",
    "for a given network of networks , it is easy to construct a message passing algorithm indicating if node @xmath10 is in the mutually connected component .",
    "let us denote by @xmath22 the message within a layer , from node @xmath10 to node @xmath20 , where @xmath23 provided node @xmath10 is in the mutually connected component if we remove the link @xmath20 in network @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , let us denote by @xmath24 the message that the node @xmath10 sends to the interconnected with it node @xmath21 in layer @xmath7 .",
    "the message @xmath25 indicates if the node @xmath10 is in the mutually connected component when we remove the link between node @xmath10 and node @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , we assume that node @xmath10 can be removed or not removed from the network .",
    "we indicate with @xmath26 a node removed from the network , otherwise @xmath27 .",

    "for the specific topology of the network of networks formed by @xmath2 layers , that we consider , there is a clear difference between a tree supernetwork and a supernetwork with loops as observed also in @xcite .",

    "this configuration is based on a supernetwork of three layers formed by a loop of size @xmath40 .    in this multiplex network percolation",
    "turns out to be very different from the network of networks with random interconnections based on the same supernetwork ( loop of @xmath40 ) , see the subsequent section .",
    "the reason for this difference is just that in the multiplex network the nodes can only link to their replica nodes in contrast to the networks of networks with random interconnections .",

    "the reason for this coincidence was explained in the introduction . in particular , these equations are the same as for a multiplex network , i.e. for a network of networks with interdependent replica nodes , based on a fully connected supernetwork . finally , if all the layers have the same degree distribution and so the generating functions @xmath48 , @xmath49 , then the average message and the order parameters are the same for every layer , i.e. @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and they are given by & = & p^m[1-g_0(1-)]^m-1[1-g_1(1- ) ] , + s&=&p^m[1-g_0(1-)]^m .",
    "[ t3 ]      it is interesting to study the role of partial interdependencies on the robustness of network of networks with tress supernetwork . the concept of partial interdependencies has been introduced and discussed already in @xcite . if each node is interdependent on a node linked to it in the other layer with probability @xmath52 ( equivalently one can say that the fraction @xmath53 of the interlinks is removed ) , then eqs .

    "based on secs .",
    "[ iva ] and [ ivb ] , we conclude that the percolation transition in a network of networks in the case of a tree supernetwork has the following properties :    * the size of the mutually connected giant component depends only on the number of layers @xmath2 but not on the other details of the structure of the tree supernetwork . *",
    "if the degree distribution of each layer is the same , all the networks either contain a giant cluster or none does . *",
    "the mutually connected components appears discontinuously if there is no partial interdependence .",
    "* in the presence of a probability @xmath52 that an interlink indicates an actual interdependence , there is a critical value @xmath57 such that for @xmath58 the percolation transition becomes continuous . *",
    "the equations determining the size of the mutually connected component are the same as the ones valid for a network of networks in which the nodes can be linked only to their replica nodes in other layers , as , e.g. , in the case of a multiplex network .",
    "the case of a supernetwork with loops significantly differ from a tree supernetwork since the size of the connected components of interdependent nodes can be actually much larger than @xmath2 and fluctuates from node to node .",
    "let us consider for simplicity a loop supernetwork formed by @xmath2 layers of @xmath4 nodes in each layer .",
    "the loops is labelled in such way that layer @xmath6 is connected with layer @xmath59 and layer @xmath60 , where we identify layer @xmath61 with layer @xmath62 and layer @xmath63 with layer @xmath64 .",
    "therefore we assume that each node in layer @xmath6 is connected with a node in layer @xmath59 and a node in layer @xmath60 , but that these nodes are chosen randomly . for this network of networks ,",
    "a node @xmath10 is in the mutually connected component if and only if at least one its neighbor within the same layer is in the mutually connected component and if all the nodes that can be reached by interdependencies links from this node [ their set is denoted by @xmath36 ] are in the mutually connected component .",
    "note that the size of @xmath36 is not determined by @xmath2 since a connected component of the interlinks can be larger than @xmath2 .",
    "clearly , the connected component @xmath36 of any node @xmath10 must be a loop in these networks of networks .",
    "let us calculate the probability that this loop has size @xmath66 .",
    "we start from a node @xmath10 in layer @xmath67 , and proceed in one direction of the loop after @xmath2 steps ( i.e. , after one complete turnover ) we come back to layer @xmath67 . since the supernetwork is a loop and since each node that we are visiting in this path has `` superdegree '' 2 ( number of its interlinks ) we can not visit these nodes more than once in the path . therefore the only possibility to close",
    "a loop is that , moving all the time forward , we will finally return to the starting node .",
    "the probability that we do not meet the initial node after one round is    ( 1 - 1/n ) .",
    "the probability that we do not meet this node at the @xmath66-th round is , because at each round we can only connect either to the original node or to one of the not visited nodes of the network .",
    "proceeding in this way we find that the probability that starting from layer @xmath67 we end in this layer after @xmath66 rounds along the loop is given by the expression p(s)=\\ {    lcc_i=0^s-2(1- ) & & s>1 + & & s=1    . [ psl ] simplifying this expression it is easy to find that @xmath68 is uniform , i.e. p(s)=. we assume that every layer has the same degree distribution , so averaging over the ensemble we obtain the following equation for @xmath69 : = p_s=1^n p(s)[1-g_0(1-)]^ms-1 [ 1-g_1(1- ) ] . performing the sum , we obtain & = & + & & ^m-1[1-g_1(1- ) ] , which leads to @xmath70 .",
    "therefore in this networks for @xmath71 we never observe the mutually connected component .",
    "this can be also understood intuitively by making the following observation . in any layer",
    "the probability that by following a uniformly randomly chosen link we reach a node @xmath10 belonging to a component @xmath36 of cardinality @xmath72 is @xmath68 . since @xmath68 is uniform , i.e. @xmath73 with @xmath74 $ ] , the probability that a component @xmath36 is formed by a finite number of layers is vanishing as @xmath71 .",
    "this means that the clusters formed by interlinks are typically diverging with the system size @xmath4 implying the absence of the mutually connected component in these systems .",
    "we showed above that in the absence of partial interdependence , the probability that a randomly chosen node belongs to a loop of size @xmath75 is @xmath76 .",
    "given the partial interdependencies , one can be in three situations , namely either the node belongs to a loop formed by interdependency links that are not removed , or the node belongs to a loop with only one link removed , or the node belongs to a segment of a loop starting and ending on two points having partial interdependencies . in the first case the probability @xmath77 that a random node @xmath10 belongs to a connected component of interdependency links of size @xmath78 is given by ^(1)(s|s)=r^s(s , ms ) , with @xmath79 .",
    "in the second case the node belongs to a loop of size @xmath66 where only one link has been removed due to the partial interdependence .",
    "the probability that a random node @xmath10 belongs to a connected component of this type is given by ^(2)(s|s)=r^s-1(1-r)(s , ms ) , where we have taken into account the fact that the single removed link can be any of the @xmath80 interlinks forming the loop .",
    "finally in the case in which the random node belongs to a segment of the loop of size @xmath80 we have ^(3)(s|s)=s(1-r)^2r^s-1(ms - s ) , where @xmath81 if @xmath82 and @xmath83 if @xmath84 .",
    "therefore the probability that a random node belongs to a connected component of size @xmath85 is given by ( s)=_s=1^n .",
    "finally , averaging over the ensemble , and considering these different possibilities , we have & & = p_s=1^nm(s)[1-g_0(1-)]^s-1 [ 1-g_1(1- ) ] .",
    "[ rl ]    let us define the function h(x)=x - p_s=1^nm(s)[1-g_0(1-x)]^s-1[1-g_1(x ) ] . for @xmath86",
    "the mutually connected component reduces to the giant component of a single layer having an ordinary continuous percolation transition .",
    "therefore we assume that there is a critical value of @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath57 such that for all @xmath58 the model has a second order phase transition . by imposing the condition @xmath87",
    ", we determine the position of these phase transitions , while the tricritical point @xmath57 can be found by imposing @xmath88 .",
    "we found therefore that the second order critical point occurs at p(1)=1 , and inserting the value of @xmath89 we get p(1-r)^2=1 .",
    "note that for @xmath86 this is the well known percolation threshold of single networks . at the tricritical point",
    "we also have @xmath90 giving the condition 2(2)=(1 ) . inserting the values of @xmath89 and @xmath91",
    "we get 4(1-r)^2r=(1-r)^2 .",
    "therefore we found that @xmath92 is given by the following relation : r_c=(1 , ) .",
    "if every layer has a poisson degree distribution with average degree @xmath93 we conclude that the transition is second - order for every @xmath94 with a critical point at p=. on the contrary , for @xmath95 , the transition is discontinuous .      we summarize the results obtained for a loop supernetwork formed by layers with the same number of nodes and the same degree distribution in the following points :    * if the supernetwork is a loop , and the interdependencies are random , the size of the mutually connected component is zero for any value of @xmath2 , i.e. different from the size of the connected component of a multiplex network formed by the same layers .",
    "* the percolation transition can become continuous in the case of partial interdependence .",

    "we find that this model differs strongly from the network of networks in that each node has a replica node in each of the other layer and can be only interconnected to its replica nodes , see fig .",

    "[ f1]a , is that in the latter case , the mutually connected component emerges simultaneously in all the layers , whereas if the interlinks can connect random nodes ( not replica nodes ) then the mutually connected component can have multiple phase transitions at which layer of higher superdegree begin percolate at different value of @xmath96 , where @xmath96 is the probability that initially a random node is not damaged .",

    "@xcite each node of a given layer has a fixed number of superdegrees and each node can be interdependent on nodes in any random layer .",
    "therefore the notion of the supernetwork is actually absent .",
    "in contrast to this , in the present work , there is a supernetwork , see fig .",
    "[ f1]b , and the nodes of each given layer are connected to random nodes of the interdependent layers .",
    "the similarity of the solutions of the two models exists when the supernetwork is random , and so the connected components @xmath36 of the nodes @xmath10 are random networks in both cases . in particularly we show that the multiple phase transitions are observed when the supernetwork is an uncorrelated network with a given superdegree distribution . in this case",
    "the multiple phase transitions remain discontinuous and hybrid as long as there is no partial interdependence . in the presence of partial interdependence some of these transitions can become continuous , and we can observe coexistence of continuous and discontinuous phase transitions .",
