    "soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) have attracted a lot of attention recently , since there exist at least two sources in which quasi - periodic oscillations have been observed .",
    "the frequency of these oscillations , in the tail of the burst , indicate that they must originate in the vicinity of the sgr source , thought to be a magnetar @xcite .",
    "a popular model for explaining these oscillations involves the excitation of torsional modes in the solid crust of the star @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation has been provided by @xcite . in a simple toy model , they showed that , in addition to crustal modes , a magnetized star could also have a discrete spectrum of global alfvn modes , which would dominate over crustal modes for sufficiently strong magnetic fields .",
    "here we investigate global , torsional alfvn modes in realistic models of relativistic stars with a global dipole magnetic field and compare our computed frequencies with observations .",
    "sgrs produce giant flares with peak luminosities of @xmath3  @xmath4 erg / s , which display a decaying tail for several hundred seconds . up to now , three giant flares have been detected , sgr 0526 - 66 in 1979 , sgr 1900 + 14 in 1998 , and sgr 1086 - 20 in 2004 .",
    "the timing analysis of the latter two events revealed several quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the decaying tail , with frequencies of 18 , 26 , 29 , 92.5 , 150 , 626.5 , and 1837 hz for sgr 1806 - 20 and 28 , 54 , 84 , and 155 hz for sgr 1900 + 14 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , for sgr 1806 - 20 the possible detection of two additional higher frequencies ( 720 hz and 2384 hz ) has been reported @xcite .",
    "spherical stars have generally two type oscillations , spheroidal modes with even parity and the toroidal modes with axial parity . the observed qpos in sgr tails",
    "are thought to originate from toroidal oscillations , since the latter are excited more easily than poloidal oscillations , as toroidal modes do not involve density variations . in newtonian theory ,",
    "there have been several investigations of torsional modes in neutron star crusts , see e.g. @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "only a few studies have taken general relativity into account @xcite .",
    "the more recent of these studies ( see e.g. @xcite , hereafter paper  i ) have shown that some of the observational data of sgrs could agree with the crust torsional modes , if , e.g. , frequencies lower than 155 hz are identified with the fundamental modes of different harmonic index @xmath5 , while higher frequencies are identified with overtones . however , as mentioned in paper  i it will be quite challenging to identify all observed qpo frequencies with crustal torsional modes .",
    "for example , it is difficult to explain both the frequencies of 26 and 29 hz for sgr 1806 - 20 for a single stellar model , because the actual spacing of torsional modes of the crust is larger than the difference between these two frequencies .",
    "similarly , the spacing between the 626.5 and 720 hz qpos in sgr 1806 - 20 may be too small to be explained by consecutive overtones of crustal torsional modes . in the present paper , we show that such difficulties are avoided if one identifies the observed frequencies with global alfvn modes .",
    "the article is structured as follows : in the next section [ sec : ii ] we briefly summarize the equations to be solved and the assumptions made . in section [ sec : iii ] we discuss the numerical results , where to understand qualitatively the properties of global alfvn modes we also treat two special cases . the comparison with the observed data in sgrs are done in section [ sec : iv ] and finally we give a summary and discussion in section [ sec : v ] .",
    "unless otherwise noted , we adopt units of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively , while the metric signature is @xmath9 .",
    "the main equations and numerical method required for the present study have already been derived in paper i. here , we only give a brief summary of the main assumptions and final relations .",
    "we assume that the equilibrium stellar model is described by a solution of the tov equations for nonrotating , relativistic stars and a metric of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are functions of the schwarzschild radial coordinate @xmath13 .",
    "we neglect the influence of the magnetic field on the equilibrium configuration , since the magnetic energy @xmath14 is negligible , compared to the gravitational binding energy @xmath15 , @xmath16 .    adopting the ideal mhd approximation",

    "we have used a variety of neutron star models , using four different equations of state for the core , ranging from a very soft eos ( eos a ) @xcite to a very stiff ( eos l ) @xcite , with two intermediate ones , eos wff3 @xcite and apr @xcite . for each eos we constructed a number of models , starting from a gravitational mass of @xmath26 and reaching close to the maximum mass limit in increments of @xmath27 . in order to separately investigate the effect of the composition of the crust , we matched the various high - density eos to two different proposed equations of state for the crust , one recent derived by @xcite ( dh ) and , for reference , and older eos by @xcite ( nv ) .",
    "the two crust eos differ significantly both in the detailed composition , as well as in the density at the base of the crust , which is at @xmath28gr/@xmath29 for @xcite and at @xmath30gr/@xmath29 for @xcite .",
    "for the stiff eos these different properties of the crust have a considerable effect on the bulk properties .",
    "figure 1 of paper  i displays the mass - radius relationship of nonrotating equilibrium models constructed with the various high - density eos , in combination with our two choices for the crust eos .",
    "the individual models for which we compute torsional modes are shown with symbols , while their detailed properties are also listed in table 1 of paper  i.    for studying individual oscillation modes , the linearized dynamical equations governing the magnetized fluid and crust are specialized to the case of axial perturbations , adopting the relativistic cowling approximation ( i.e. neglecting spacetime perturbations ) . in this case , the only nonvanishing perturbed fluid variable is ( assuming a harmonic time dependence with frequency @xmath31 ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 denotes the partial derivative with respect to @xmath35 .",
