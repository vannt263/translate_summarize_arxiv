    "let @xmath0 be a sequence of independent real random vectors of @xmath1-dimension and let @xmath2 be the lag-@xmath3 ( @xmath3 is a fixed positive integer ) auto - covariance matrix of @xmath4 .",
    "the motivation of the above set up is due to the study of dynamic factor model , see @xcite . set @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a @xmath1-dimensional sequence observed at time @xmath10 , @xmath11 a sequence of @xmath12-dimensional `` latent factor '' ( @xmath13 ) uncorrelated with the error process @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the general mean .",
    "therefore , the lag-@xmath3 auto - covariance matrix of the time series @xmath9 can be considered as a finite rank ( rank @xmath12 ) perturbation of the lag-@xmath3 auto - covariance matrix of @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the first step is to study the base component , which is the lag-@xmath3 auto - covariance matrix of the error term . besides , we are considering the random matrix framework , where the dimension @xmath1 and the sample size @xmath16 both tend to infinity with their ratio converging to a constant : @xmath17 .",
    "one of the main problems in random matrix theory is to investigate the convergence of the sequence of _ empirical spectral distribution _",

    "the limit distribution @xmath7 , which is usually nonrandom , is called the _ limiting spectral distribution _ ( lsd ) of the sequence @xmath19 .",
    "the study of spectral analysis of large dimensional random matrices dates back to the wigner s famous semicircular law ( @xcite ) for wigner matrix , which is further extended in various aspects : marenko - pastur ( m - p ) law ( @xcite ) for large dimensional sample covariance matrix ; and circular law for complex random matrix ( @xcite ) .",
    "another aspect is the bound on extreme eigenvalues",
    ". the literature dates back to @xcite , who proved the almost sure convergence of the largest eigenvalue of a sample covariance matrix under however some moment restrictions , which is later improved by @xcite . for wigner matrix",
    ", @xcite found the sufficient and necessary condition for the almost sure convergence of its largest eigenvalue .",
    "@xcite presented an upper bound for the spectral norm of symmetric random matrices with independent entries and @xcite derived the lower bound .",
    "@xcite studied the sharp upper bound of the spectral norm of products of random and deterministic matrices , which behave similarly to random matrices with independent entries , etc .",
    "notice that lag-@xmath23 auto - covariance matrix of @xmath4 reduces to the standard sample covariance matrix @xmath24 and its property in large - dimension has been well developed in the literature .",
    "in contrast , very few is known for the lag-@xmath3 auto - covariance matrix @xmath5 .",
    "recent related work include @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for the lsd of the symmetrized auto - covariance matrix and @xcite for its exact separation , which also ensures the convergence of its largest eigenvalue .",
    "since @xmath5 is not symmetric , its singular values are the square roots of the @xmath1 nonnegative eigenvalues of @xmath25 therefore , the main purpose of this paper is on the limiting behaviors of the eigenvalues of @xmath26 .",
    "first , we derive exact moment formula for its lsd .",
    "next , this moment sequence is shown to satisfy the carleman condition so that it determines uniquely the lsd . then using power expansion , the stieltjes transform of the lsd @xmath27 can be found to satisfy the following equation : @xmath28 this result",
    "is derived in @xcite using a totally different stieltjes transform method .",
    "second , we show the convergence of the largest eigenvalue of @xmath26 to the right end point of the support of @xmath7 almost surely ( trivially , this implies the convergence of the largest singular value of @xmath5 ) .",
    "both these two results are derived using moment method .",
    "a distinctive feature here is that the matrix @xmath26 can be considered as the product of four matrices involving @xmath4 , new methodology is needed with respect to the existing literature on random matrix theory . in particular , we provide in section [ de ] some recursion formula related to the number of random walks , which further leads to our moment result , and the method may be of independent interest .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows",
