    "the most massive structures in the local universe are superclusters , which are still collapsing with galaxy clusters and groups frequently interacting and merging , and where a significant number of galaxies are encountering dense environments for the first time .",
    "the shapley supercluster ( hereafter ssc ) was chosen because of i ) the peculiar cluster , galaxy and baryon overdensities @xcite ; ii ) the relative dynamical immaturity of this supercluster and the possible presence of infalling dark matter haloes as well as evidence of cluster - cluster mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , none of them could systematically tackle the issue of galaxy evolution in the supercluster environment due to the lack of accurate and homogeneous multi - band imaging covering such an extended structure .",
    "shass aims to fill this gap measuring the integrated [ magnitudes , colours , star formation rates ( sfrs ) ] and internal ( morphological features , internal colour gradients ) properties of the supercluster galaxies .",
    "shass will map a region of @xmath0 260 h@xmath12 mpc@xmath1 ( at z=0.048 ) , centred on the ssc core , which is constituted by three abell clusters : a3558 ( z=0.048 , melnick & quintana @xcite , metcalfe , godwin & spenser @xcite ; abell richness @xmath13=4 , abell , corwin & olowin @xcite ) , a3562 ( z=0.049 , @xmath13=2 ) and a3556 ( z=0.0479 , @xmath13=0 ) ; and two poor clusters sc1327 - 312 and sc 1329 - 313 .",
    "the present survey covers also six other abell clusters : a3552 , a3554 , a3559 , a3560 , as0724 , as0726 , as shown in fig .",
    "the survey boundaries are chosen not only to cover all 11 clusters and the likely connecting filaments , but also to extend into the field and to map the structures directly connected to the ssc core . in @xcite we derived the stellar mass density distribution based on supercluster members showing that all the clusters in the shass area are embedded in a common network and identified a filament connecting the ssc core and the cluster a3559 as well as the less pronounced overdensity extending from the ssc core towards a3560 .",

    "the survey depth enables global and internal physical properties of shapley galaxies to be derived down to @xmath26 + 6 . in the first case of obtaining accurate measurements of aperture photometry and colours , we require signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ) of 20 in all four bands for ssc galaxies down to @xmath26 + 6 . secondly ,",

    "the pipeline follows the standard procedures for bias subtraction and flat - field correction .",
    "a normalized combination of the dome and twilight flats , in which the twilight flat is passed through a low - pass filter first , were used to create the master flat .",
    "a gain harmonization procedure has been applied , finding the relative ccd gain coefficients which minimizes the background level differences in adjacent ccds .",
    "a further correction is applied to account for the light scattered by the telescope and instrumental baffling .",
    "this is an additional component to the background , which , if not corrected for , causes a position - dependent bias in the photometric measurements .",
    "this component is subtracted through the determination and the application of the illumination correction ( ic ) map .",
    "the ic map is determined by comparing the magnitudes of photometric standard fields with the corresponding sdss - dr8 ( sloan digital sky survey - data release 8) psf magnitudes .    for the @xmath10 band",
    "a correction is required because of the fringe pattern due to thin - film interference effects in the detector from sky emission lines .",
    "the fringing pattern is estimated as the ratio between the super - flat and the twilight sky flat , where super - flat is obtained by overscan and bias correcting a sigma clipped combination of science images .",
    "the fringe pattern is subtracted from the image , applying a scale factor which minimizes the absolute difference between the peak and valley values ( maximum and minimum in the image background ) in the fringe corrected image .",
    "the photometric calibration onto the sdss photometric system is performed in two steps : first a relative photometric calibration among the exposures contributing to the final mosaic image is obtained through the comparison of the magnitudes of the bright unsaturated stars in the different exposures , using the software scamp ( bertin @xcite ) ; then the absolute photometric calibration is computed on the photometric nights comparing the observed magnitude of stars in photometric standard fields with sdss photometry . for those fields observed on clear nights ,",
    "we take advantage of the sample of bright unsaturated stars in the overlapping region between clear and photometric pointings and by using scamp , each exposure of the clear fields is calibrated on to the contiguous photometrically calibrated field . the magnitude",
    "is then calibrated by adopting the following relation :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the magnitude of the star in the standard system , @xmath42 is the instrumental magnitude , @xmath43 is the coefficient of the colour term , @xmath44 is the colour of the star in the standard system , @xmath45 is the extinction coefficient , @xmath46 is the airmass and @xmath47 is the zero - point .",
