    "in a recent paper  @xcite we reported numerical modeling and experimental demonstration of inertial pumping . in this effect",
    "@xcite , fluid is confined within a thin channel connecting two large reservoirs and pumped by a high - pressure vapor bubble that repeatedly expands and collapses .",
    "the bubbles can be created by a number of actuation methods including thermal resistors  @xcite , electrical currents passing through the fluid  @xcite , localized laser pulses  @xcite , and acoustic actuation  @xcite .",
    "if the bubbles are generated away from the geometric center of the channel , the dynamics of the two fluidic columns are asymmetric , which results in a net flow from the short toward the long arm of the channel .",
    "the pumping action has been attributed to unequal inertia of the two fluidic columns inside the channel  @xcite .",
    "while several numerical studies have been done in realistic three - dimensional geometries  @xcite , the main effect can be captured within a simple one - dimensional model derived from momentum balance  @xcite .",
    "the model has been used to prove nonzero net flow  @xcite and illustrate the main qualitative features of the pump through numerical analysis  @xcite .",
    "the model is nonlinear and in general not solvable analytically .",
    "however , for realistic values of pressure ( several atmospheres ) , channel width ( tens of microns ) , and fluid properties ( density , viscosity , and surface tension of water ) , the dynamics is dominated by the balance between inertia and pressure forces  @xcite . if only those two factors are left in the dynamic equation , the latter simplifies so much that an analytical solution becomes possible .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present this solution , which provides insight into the mechanism of inertial pumping and becomes a useful tool for studying this effect .",
    "consider the geometry of fig .  [",
    "oned : fig : one](a ) .",
    "a thin channel of cross - sectional area @xmath0 is connected to two much wider reservoirs .",
    "the reservoirs and the channel are filled with incompressible fluid of density @xmath1",
    ". the pressures in the reservoirs far from the channel are @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . in the most common case ,",
    "both bulk pressures are equal to the atmospheric pressure @xmath4 , but more general cases may be considered . inside",
    "the channel is a resistive microheater that locally boils the fluid and creates high - pressure vapor bubbles .",
    "each bubble expands and collapses , resulting in a nonzero net flow through the channel [ see figs .  [",
    "oned : fig : one](b)-[oned : fig : one](g ) ] .",
    "the microheater must be positioned asymmetrically relative to the channel s ends to achieve pumping .",
    "the simplest approach to flow dynamics is to completely neglect transverse motion of the fluid in the channel , three - dimensional features of the bubble shape , and curvature of the vapor - fluid interface .",
    "these assumptions are approximate ; however , they do not change the qualitative picture of inertial pumping . through full three - dimensional computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) modeling",
    "we showed that pumping is most efficient when the bubble occupies the entire cross section of the channel pushing the fluid primarily along the channel s axis  @xcite . under these assumptions ,",
    "the channel is approximated by a one - dimensional line and a vapor - fluid interface by a single point on this line .",
    "thus a single bubble is fully described by the time - dependent positions of two interfaces @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the case of more than one bubble can be formulated in the same manner . the goal of the present paper is to analyze the single bubble case .",
    "consider the left column of fluid ( see fig .",
    "[ oned : fig : one ] ) .",
    "its length is @xmath7 , velocity @xmath8 , and total momentum @xmath9 . in a time interval",
    "@xmath10 the momentum changes because of two factors : ( i ) the force @xmath11 acting on the fluid and ( ii ) momentum lost to or supplied by the left reservoir . during the expansion phase @xmath12 and the column loses a negative momentum @xmath13 to the reservoir .",
    "this element must be added to momentum balance as a positive increment : @xmath14 during the collapse phase @xmath15 , and the column acquires a positive momentum @xmath13 from the reservoir and the same equation applies . substituting @xmath16",
    "one derives the dynamic equation  @xcite @xmath17 this is a variable - mass newton equation , but without the mass - derivative term : the latter has been dissipated by the reservoir . a similar momentum balance analysis yields , for the right fluidic column , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total channel length .",
    "in this case , the right reservoir absorbs or supplies the extra mechanical momentum .",
    "the major forces at play during the expansion - collapse cycle are ( i ) pressure - difference forces , ( ii ) viscous forces , and ( iii ) surface tension forces .",
    "the surface tension forces are about two orders of magnitude smaller than the other two for typical microfluidic conditions  @xcite and can be safely neglected .",
    "the viscous force is typically smaller than the pressure force , but is not always negligible .",
    "the simplest way to account for the viscous force is to assume that it is proportional to velocity and also to the length of the column because it acts along the fluid - surface boundary .",
    "the resulting one - dimensional model reads @xmath20 here @xmath21 characterizes the relative strength of the viscous force . under further assumptions , @xmath21 can be linked to other parameters of the system .",
    "for example , within the poiseuille flow @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the bulk viscosity of the fluid .",
    "this relationship is derived in the appendix . in this work @xmath21",
    "will be treated as an independent phenomenological parameter .",
    "the next step is to specify the pressures in eqs .",
    "( [ onedf : eq : four ] ) and ( [ onedf : eq : five ] ) .",
    "there @xmath24 is the vapor pressure inside the vapor bubble , while @xmath25 are the fluid pressures inside the reservoirs near the channel s ends [ see fig .",
    "[ oned : fig : one](a ) ] .",
    "all pressures are time dependent and require separate considerations .",
    "let us begin with the vapor bubble .",
    "a typical pumping event starts with a microheater boiling the surrounding fluid within a fraction of a microsecond .",
    "this creates a thin layer of superheated vapor with pressure of about 810 atm @xcite .",
    "this high - pressure phase lasts about 1 @xmath26s .",
    "then the pressure quickly drops to subatmospheric levels because of bubble expansion and heat transfer losses .",
    "the residual bubble pressure ( the saturation pressure of the vapor at the ambient temperature ) is about @xmath27 atm .",
    "since the entire pumping cycle lasts dozens of microseconds , the initial high - pressure phase can be approximated as instantaneous impact on the fluid , as a result of which the fluid acquires mechanical momentum @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "this leads to the following impulse bubble model : @xmath29 in this approximation , the bubble strength is characterized by the initial fluid momentum @xmath28 . since the impulse has negligible time duration , @xmath28 drops out from the model equations and enters the dynamics only via the initial conditions .",
    "this greatly simplifies the analysis .",
    "if a detailed physical model of the vapor bubble is known , @xmath28 can be estimated from eq .",
    "( [ onedf : eq : seven ] ) by integrating the vapor pressure over the bubble s lifetime . in this work , @xmath28 will be treated as an independent phenomenological parameter .",
    "consider now the pressures at the channel s ends @xmath25 .",
    "in general , they are different from the respective bulk pressures @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the fluid dynamics in the reservoirs is complex .",
    "first , the formation of a jet during outward flow and the formation of a sink during inward flows results in asymmetry .",
    "second , the pumping event is inherently transient .",
    "the fluid expelled in the reservoirs forms three - dimensional vortices that persist long after the bubble collapse  @xcite .",
    "one consequence of the vortices is nonhomogeneous inward flow : the fluid is filling up the channel along the walls while emptying the channel near its axis at the same time .",
    "all of this makes the task of finding a representative one - dimensional boundary condition nontrivial . however , a detailed analysis of the reservoir flow is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "the main goal here is to elucidate the physics behind inertial pumping by using simplified one - dimensional dynamics as the analysis tool . from this perspective , replacing the complex reservoir dynamics with a deterministic boundary condition at the end of the channel is acceptable , as long as it is physically justified and consistent with net pumping .",
    "the easiest approach is to simply neglect all the above - mentioned effects and set the end pressures equal to the bulk values : @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this choice will be referred to as the symmetrical model because it does not distinguish between outflow and inflow .",
    "the main advantage of the symmetrical model is simplicity ; it is the easiest way to derive the main qualitative features of inertial pumping .",
    "a different model was proposed by yuan and prosperetti  @xcite , who tried to account for the asymmetry between expansion and collapse . during bubble expansion",
    ", the fluid is injected into the reservoir as a jet that separates from the rest of the fluid .",
    "the pressure near the entry point is close to the bulk pressure of the reservoir , @xmath32 . during collapse , however , part of the pressure difference is expended on accelerating the fluid inside the reservoir .",
    "this is a sink flow @xcite . according to the bernoulli equation , @xmath33 .",
    "as mentioned above , vortex formation near channel ends disturbs the sink flow and it is unclear to what extent the bernoulli correction can be applied to the situation at hand . in the absence of a detailed analysis of the pressure distribution , the proposal of yuan and prosperetti will be adopted here as the second reasonable choice of the boundary condition .",
    "hereafter , it will be referred to as the asymmetrical model .",
    "compared with the symmetrical model , it provides additional insight into the inertial pumping mechanism , but is more complex mathematically .",
    "it is of benefit to keep both options available for analysis . to this end",
    ", we introduce the discrete index @xmath34 that will distinguish between the models : @xmath35 corresponds to the symmetrical model and @xmath36 to the asymmetrical model . with such notation",
    "the pressure boundary conditions can be written as @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the heaviside step function : @xmath39 and @xmath40 .      the number of model parameters in eqs .",
    "( [ onedf : eq : four])([onedf : eq : nine ] ) can be reduced by transforming the equations to a dimensionless form . in a similar procedure in ref .",
    "[ ] , the channel diameter was taken as the unit of length and the duration of the high - pressure phase as the unit of time . in the present case ,",
    "both these parameters are zero , so a different pair of units is required .",
    "the choice of unit length is obvious : the total channel length @xmath19 is the only model parameter of that dimensionality . to choose a unit time one can proceed as follows",
    "in the most typical case , the bulk reservoir pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure @xmath4 .",
    "the two fluid columns will be evolving under negative pressure difference @xmath41 . that sets a characteristic fluid velocity as @xmath42 and a characteristic time as @xmath43 .",
    "the characteristic time thus defined is of the order of the total bubble lifetime and the characteristic velocity is approximately the mean fluid velocity over the same period .",

    "the net flow increases as @xmath57 deviates from @xmath59 , but in a nonmonotonic manner . this behavior will be analyzed in the following sections .",

    "quite generally , inertial pumping happens because the shorter fluidic column with its smaller mass turns around faster than the longer one under the same pressure difference .",
