    "in a hierarchical evolutionary scenario , galaxies experience accretion / merging events during their lifetime . while early - type galaxies in nearby clusters appear ( homogeneously ) old , the field early - type galaxy population seems to contain genuinely , recently _ rejuvenated _ objects ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "early - type galaxies showing fine structure , like shells , occupy a special position since they are believed to fill the gap between ongoing mergers and normal elliptical galaxies .",
    "shells are faint , sharp - edged stellar features characterizing @xmath0 16.5% of the field early - type galaxy population and avoiding cluster environments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "two major scenarios for their origin have been proposed : _ a ) _ a weak interaction between galaxies @xcite , _ b ) _ merging / accretion events @xcite . in the former scenario ,",
    "weak interaction can form long lasting azimuthally distributed shells through the interference of density waves producing a thick disc population of dynamically cold stars . however",
    ", this requires a cold thick disc , not found in ellipticals . in the merging / accretion events between galaxies of different masses ( mass ratios typically 1/10 - 1/100 , _",
    "b ) _ scenario above ) shells are density waves formed from infalling stars from the companion during a minor merger .",
    "major merger can also produce shells @xcite .",
    "whatever the mechanism is , interaction / merging events seem to have played a significant role in the formation / evolution of the early - type class in the field and activated a new star formation event @xcite .    whether there is a link between shell galaxies , the early phases of merging processes , and",
    "the class of normal early - type galaxies is still an open question . to test the depth of the link ,",
    "a multiwavelength approach is of paramount importance .",
    "the uv data probe the ongoing / recent star formation processes and study their distribution across the galaxy while the x - ray emission is connected to the past star formation and metal enrichment history of the bulk of the galaxy and may disclose hidden agn activity .",

    "beside the presence of shells , clearly visible in all three , although more spectacular in ngc 474 , these galaxies share other properties : they are in low density environments and are interacting systems . however , the details of the interaction are quite different : companions are well separated in ngc 7070a @xcite and strongly interacting in ngc 474 as shown by h_i _ observations ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "observations have been performed using uvw1 and uvm2 bands which cover the ranges 245 - 320 nm and 205 - 245 nm , respectively .",

    "the point spread function  fwhm  is @xmath02.0  in uvw1 , and 1.8  in uvm2 sampled with 0476@xmath10476 pixels . in order to complete the uv information about our galaxies we searched the _",

    "we found _ galex _ data only for the ngc  474 , that was observed the october 5th , 2003 with an exposure of 1477 and 1647 seconds in nuv and fuv bands respectively .",
    "we aim at obtaining crucial information about the time at which the accretion / merging phenomenon has occured that can be derived from the far uv and optical colours .",
    "such information is important for a proper discussion of the x - ray data . according to the evidence provided by the sample of @xcite , the x - ray luminosity could evolve during the period that characterizes phases of the galaxy - galaxy encounter , the merging and the set - up of the merging towards a relaxed galaxy .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the isointensity contours from the adaptively smoothed xmm-_newton _ of ngc 7070a and eso 2400100 superposed on the dss plates .",

    "the soft band emission is significantly stronger than the hard one and extends further than in ngc 7070a .",
    "spectral results are in agreement with the spatial picture : the nuclear source of ngc 7070a is the dominant component while in eso 2400100 the emission is indicative of a low temperature plasma .",
    "@xcite showed that ngc 474 is at the bottom of the x - ray emission distribution of e galaxies : its x - ray emission is consistent with the low end of the expected emission from discrete sources .",
    "_ galex _ data of ngc  474 ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) show that the nuv emission extends to the galaxy bulge , while the fuv emission shows up only in the central regions of the galaxy . in the ngc 474 image obtained in the uvw1 and uvm2 filters outer shells",

    "both eso  2400100 ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) and ngc  7070a have extension similar to that of the optical image in the om - uvw1 and in the _ galex _ nuv filter .",
    "this implies that the uv emission comes from the same kind of stellar population .",
    "the fuv emission , more concentrated toward the nucleus is most likely dominated by the emission of different types of hot stars ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in figure  [ fig3 ] ( mid and left panels )",
    "the uvw1 and uvm2 images show the two nuclei embedded in eso 2400100 .",
    "the northern nucleus is significantly bluer than the southern one .",
    "@xcite noticed that the two nuclei have a significantly different h@xmath2 line - strength indices ( 2.79 in the northern nucleus vs. 1.54 in the southern one ) suggesting a different stellar population composition .",
    "the accretion of faint galaxies seems one of the drivers of the secular evolution of galaxies in loose , poor groups .",
    "since shells are widely believed to be generated by an accretion event , shell galaxies potentially trace the typical secular evolution of early - type galaxies in such environments .",
    "furthermore , there is a growing evidence of multiple accretion events in the same galaxy .",
    "the complex shell system of ngc 474 is believed to be generated by two distinct accretion events @xcite . in this framework",
    "the double nucleus in eso  2400100 is an interesting and puzzling case at the same time .",
    "is the second nucleus the cause of the observed system of shells or another evidence of a new , on - going , accretion event ?"
