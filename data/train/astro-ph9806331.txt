    "the scaling relations between some global properties of ellipticals ( es ) , known as the ` fundamental plane ' ( fp ; dressler et al .",
    "1987 , djorgovski & davis 1987 ) , is clearly a manifestation of a great ` regularity ' in the properties of es .",
    "although a proof of its ` universality ' is still lacking , the fp has been widely applied to various problems : from the study of peculiar motions ( lynden - bell et al .",
    "1988 , jrgensen et al .",
    "1996 ) , to the study of the evolution of m / l ratios ( van dokkum & franx 1996 , kelson et al .",
    "1997 ) , and measurements of @xmath3 ( bender et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the ` regularity ' of the e s properties , shown by the fp , must be connected to their gross structural characteristics and to their formation and evolutionary mechanisms ( djorgovski et al .",
    "1995 and references therein ) . to understand this connection is however a very hard task , especially in view of the problems posed by the ` thinness ' of the fp itself ( ciotti et al . 1996 ) .",
    "apart from the obvious similarities , it is a matter of fact that es do not constitute a homogeneous family of galaxies : es not only have substantially different photometric and kinematical properties , but they also host a variety of sub - components , like inner disks , counter - rotating cores , outer rings , dust lanes , etc .

    "the possibility that many es have disks that escape photometric detection ( simien & de vaucouleurs 1986 , capaccioli 1987 , rix & white 1990 , saglia et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the dichotomy between the two families of boxy and disky es lead to the possibility of a new classification scheme , in which galaxies formerly belonging to the same hubble type are separated according to isophotal shape , and in which a continuous sequence exists between es and s0s ( kormendy & bender 1996 ) . since the above scenario is manifestly at odds with the ` regularity ' of the fp , the question arises to what extent the ` global ' quantities entering into the construction of the fp are representative of the real status of the galaxies .    in this respect ,",
    "an important question is whether the central velocity dispersion @xmath4 is fully representative of the dynamical status of a galaxy .",
    "there is much evidence that this is not the case : due to differences in velocity dispersion profiles and anisotropy , masses derived from @xmath4 can be wrong by a factor of ten ( tonry 1983 , richstone & tremaine 1986 , mathews 1988 ) ; in presence of central , kinematically distinct sub - components , the value of @xmath4 is likely to be more connected to the sub - component than to the galaxy as a whole ; es are dynamically non - homologous systems : the slope of the velocity dispersion profile is correlated to @xmath4 in such a way that there is a systematic departure of the kinetic energy from a simple scaling of @xmath4 ( graham & colless 1997 , busarello et al .",
    "1997 ) ; finally , the rotation , although not dominant in es , plays a non - negligible role ( busarello et al .",
    "1992 , prugniel & simien 1994 , 1996 , busarello et al .",
    "1997 , donofrio et al .",
    "1997 ) .    to fully understand the complex kinematics of es , and to analyze the connection between the individual properties of es and the scaling laws , it is essential to have access to kinematical data as accurate , extended and homogeneous as possible .",
    "one of the objectives of the present work is to obtain homogeneous sets of data for magnitude - limited samples of elliptical galaxies belonging to different clusters .    in the present paper",
    "we present new stellar kinematical data for 13 galaxies in the fornax cluster .",
    "section 2 describes the observations and the data reduction . in sect .  3 , we give a short description of the major features of each of the kinematical profiles .",
    "section 4 provides a comparison of our data with previous observations , and in sect .",
    "5 we briefly summarize our findings .",
    "the data themselves are presented in appendix a and in table 3 ( available in electronic form from the cds ) .",

    "we were able to obtain kinematical data for 12 of these galaxies making our investigation 86% complete at that limiting magnitude .",
    "in addition , we have obtained kinematical data for fcc 119 , ( classified as a s0 galaxy by ferguson , and for which we give only the central velocity dispersion ( cvd ) and v@xmath8 ) .",
    "the spectra were obtained over two runs in november and december 1996 using the blue arm of the double beam spectrograph attached to the australian national university s 2.3 m telescope at siding spring observatory .",
    "dichroic # 3 was used , providing greater than 95% transmission at all wavelengths between 4000 - 6000  .",
    "a 1200 _ l _ mm@xmath9 grating was used , with a dispersion of 0.555 @xmath10 pixel@xmath9 over a range of 1000 @xmath10 centered on 5200  .",
    "the ccd used was a site chip ( 1752@xmath11532 ) with 15 @xmath12 m pixels .",
    "the spatial scale on the chip was 0.91@xmath13 pixel@xmath9 .",
    "we used a spectrograph slit of 2@xmath13 on the sky and of length greater than the spatial extent of the ccd .",
    "the best collimator focus gave a fwhm for the arc lines of 2.7 pixels or 1.50  , giving a resolution of 86 km s@xmath9 at 5200  . during the observations the seeing varied from 1.5 to 2.5 arcsec .",

    "the last column gives the ` rotation parameter ' @xmath2 which measures the relevance of the rotational support ( notice that this value is virtually infinite for ngc 1419 , for which @xmath57 ( caon et al . 1994 ) ) .",

    "figures 1 and 2 in appendix b show our data compared to the previous studies .",
    "we summarize here how our data compare with the other groups results .",
    "three of our sample galaxies are in common with the study by franx et al .",
    "( 1989 ; hereafter fih ) .",
    "our rc of ngc 1379 is in close agreement , while our vdp _ has a shallower gradient compared to that by fih _ , but agrees with the cvd measure of @xmath5135 km s@xmath9 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the minor - axis vdp of fih is instead fully consistent both with ours and with the vdp of donofrio et al .",
    "both the vdp and the rc of ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 agree with those by fih .",

    "( 1989 ) is made difficult by the larger uncertainties in their results ( their rc is actually consistent with any rc not exceeding 30 km s@xmath9 ) .",
    "notice , however , that there is a difference of 28@xmath14 in p.a .",
    "we are also consistent with the kinematical profiles by van der marel & franx ( 1993 ) for ngc 1374 , the only galaxy from their sample in common with ours .",
    "the study with the largest number ( 8) of galaxies in common with us , is that by donofrio et al .",
    "( 1995 ; hereafter d95 , see also longo et al .",
    "their kinematical profiles are folded around the photometric centers . in general , the agreement between the two sets of data is good , with only some of discrepancies in the profiles worth mentioning ( the cvds will be addressed below ) .",
    "the first discrepancy is the up - turn in the vdp of ngc 1339 , apparent in the data of d95 at 4 - 6 arcsec .",
    "this difference can not be attributed to the folding process used by d95 and it is at odds with our data which give no indication of its presence .",
    "another discrepancy is the hump in the rc of ngc 1427 over the inner 6 arcsec . d95",
    "show it to reach a maximum rotational speed of @xmath545 km s@xmath9 , whereas our data suggests it does not reach any more than @xmath525 - 30 km s@xmath9 .",
    "the data for ngc 1404 are in agreement in the inner 10@xmath42 , even if the central dip in the vdp is less pronounced in the d95 data .",
    "the comparison is difficult beyond that radius , due to the heavy smoothing of the d95 data , that eventually lead to a wrong negative gradient of the rc . finally , the rc of ngc 1339 in d95 is steeper than ours in the inner 5@xmath42 , while the opposite happens for ngc 1374 , where d95 fail do detect the maximum at 3@xmath42 from the center .",
    "the comparison of the cvds needs some prior comments .",
    "generally , our cvd measurements agree with the values given in the above - mentioned works , and with those listed by mcelroy ( 1995 ) , with the exception of ngc 1399 , for which mcelroy gives a value of 308 km s@xmath9 .",
    "d95 give 420@xmath3927 km s@xmath9 , that is still under the 430 km s@xmath9 derived by stiavelli et al .",
    "( 1993 ) using core resolution techniques applied to observations performed under 0.7@xmath13 seeing .",
    "our cvds are systematically lower than those by d95 , that were obtained under better seeing conditions ( private communication ) . on the other hand , since the smoothing effect of the seeing is stronger for the steeper vdps , and since the gradient of the vdp is correlated to the cvd ( busarello et al .",
    "1997 ) , we expect the lower cvds to be less affected by the smoothing .",
    "the two sets of data are related by : @xmath58 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . we can then use this relation to estimate the ` corrections ' to the cvds for the other objects of our sample .",
    "these ` corrected ' cvds are also listed in table 2 .",
    "of the 12 ellipticals studied here , five ( ngc 1339 , ngc 1374 , ngc 1379 , ngc 1404 and ngc 1419 ) are rotationally supported systems , having positive rotation parameter ( log(@xmath59)*@xmath600 ) .",
    "the interest in this result is strengthened by the fact that four of these galaxies are e0/e1 systems , the only remaining round system in the sample being ngc 1399 .",
    "ngc 1374 , ngc 1379 and ngc 1404 are most probably s0 galaxies",
    "( due to the overall constancy of their rcs ; see also fisher 1997 , and the case of ngc 3379 presented in statler et al .",
    "1997 ) , although a more complex structure has to be invoked to explain their kinematical features .",
    "the rcs of ngc 1374 and ngc 1404 , in particular , may reveal the presence of a double - disk structure ( cf .",
    "seifert & scorza 1996 ) .",
    "the rotation parameter of ngc 1339 is consistent with that of an isotropic oblate model , but the shape and the asymmetry of both the vdp and the rc indicate a significant departure from a ` simple ' isotropic rotator .",
    "four objects ( ngc 1336 , fcc 136 , ngc 1373 and ngc 1419 ) are most probably sb0 galaxies : ngc 1336 and ngc 1419 , in particular , have kinematical profiles identical to the sb0 galaxy ic 456 ( bettoni 1989 , see also galletta 1996 ) .",
    "this conclusion is also strongly supported by the photometric properties , all these galaxies having strong isophotal twisting ( see the photometric profiles in caon et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the three remaining galaxies are definitely ` dynamically hot ' systems .",
    "fcc 335 is a faint galaxy ( m@xmath61=@xmath6216.8 for h@xmath63=75 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 ) with low surface brightness ( @xmath18=23.5 b mag / arcsec@xmath64 ) , low velocity dispersion ( @xmath4= 43 km s@xmath9 ) and low rotation ( v@xmath8= 24 km s@xmath9 ) .",
    "ngc 1399 and ngc 1427 are instead bright galaxies , with high ( and roughly constant ) velocity dispersions , and relatively slow rotation : this is exactly what one expects from ` true ' giant ellipticals . for both objects the present data show complex kinematics : the already - known kinematically distinct core in ngc 1399 plus a second clear kinematically distinct component visible at 10@xmath13 from the center . both from the vdp and from the rc of ngc 1427",
    "there is evidence for kinematically distinct components at the inner 2@xmath13 and inside 10@xmath13 from the center ; ngc 1427 shows also anti - correlated wiggles in both the rc and the vdp .    in summary",
    ": it seems that more than half of the galaxies in the present sample are , at least from the kinematical point of view , misclassified s(a - b)0s .",
    "morphological classification by visual inspection of images , apparently results in a dramatic over - estimate of the true number of ` dynamically hot ' stellar systems .",
    "the catalog of ferguson ( 1989 ) lists 58 fornax galaxies with @xmath6@xmath4015.0 mag , from the 14 listed as having morphological type e , only 3 turn out to be true elliptical galaxies in the classical sense of the word ; indicating that these objects are in fact quite rare .",
    "most of the objects , moreover , show complex kinematical profiles , like kinematically distinct components , wiggles , and asymmetries .",
    "the presence of ( dynamically decoupled ) sub - components is one of the possible explanations of such complex kinematics .",
    "complicated velocity fields may arise as well from triaxial systems due to competing contributions of different families of orbits ( statler 1991a , b ; statler et al .",
    "1997 , and references therein ) , like , for instance , the possible presence of a substantial fraction of retrograde orbits ( wozniak & pfenninger 1997 ; compare their fig .",
    "5(c ) to some of our rcs ) .",
    "a concluding remark is in order : all the data presented here show very complicated kinematics , which is only in part accounted for by misclassification of s0s into es .",
    "it seems , instead , conceivable that complex kinematics is a common , and dynamically stable , characteristic of elliptical galaxies .",
