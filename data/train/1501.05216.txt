    "stochastic processes in which independent particles scatter randomly at finite speed and may occasionally propagate over a long distance in single bouts are known as lvy walks .",
    "use of these models has become ubiquitous in the study of complex diffusive processes .",
    "they are particularly relevant to situations such that the probability of a long jump decays slowly with its length @xcite . the scale - free superdiffusive motion of lvy walkers @xcite has been identified as an efficient foraging strategy @xcite , spurring a large interest in these models , including with regards to human mobility patterns @xcite .",
    "a central quantity in this formalism is the distribution of free path lengths , which gives the probability that a particle propagates over a distance @xmath0 between two successive scattering events .",
    "its asymptotic scaling determines how the moments of the displacement asymptotically scale with time .",
    "assuming the probability of a free path of length @xmath0 scales asymptotically as @xmath1 , one finds , in the so - called velocity picture of lvy walks , the following scaling laws for the mean squared displacement after time @xmath2 @xcite :    @xmath3    see below for a precise definition of this quantity .",
    "a scaling parameter value @xmath4 is such that the variance of the distribution of free paths diverges , in which case the process is often called scale - free @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the asymptotic divergence of the mean squared displacement gives rise to anomalous transport in the form of superdiffusion .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , we considered lvy walks on lattices and generalized the standard description of the velocity picture of lvy walks , according to which a new jump event takes place as soon as the previous one is completed , to include an exponentially - distributed waiting time separating successive jumps . as emphasised in reference @xcite , this additional phase induces a differentiation between the states of particles which are in the process of completing a jump and those that are waiting to start a new one .",
    "we call the former states propagating and the latter scattering .",
    "the distinction between these states leads to a new theoretical framework of lvy walks in terms of multistate processes @xcite , whereby the generalized master equation approach to continuous time random walks @xcite translates into a set of delay differential equations for the corresponding distributions .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to show that a complete characterization of the solutions of such multistate processes can be obtained , which yields exact time - dependent analytic expressions of their mean squared displacement .",
    "these expressions can , on the one hand , be compared with the asymptotic solutions already reported in @xcite , and , on the other , also prove useful when the asymptotic regime is not reached , which is often the case with studies dealing with observational data .",
    "such a situation arises when the probability of a transition from scattering to propagating states is small .",
    "a particle will then spend most of its time undergoing transitions among scattering states , performing a seemingly standard continuous - time random walk , only seldom undergoing a transition to a propagating state , during which it moves ballistically over a distance distributed according to the scaling parameter @xmath5 . if @xmath5 is small enough ( @xmath6 ) , these occurrences , although rare , have a dramatic effect on the asymptotic scaling properties of the mean squared displacement , such that a crossover from normal to anomalous diffusive transport is observed .",
    "this crossover time may in some situations , however , be much larger than the times accessible to measurements . here",
    "we provide analytic results which give a precise characterisation of the emergence of an anomalous contribution out of a normally scaling one , showing how the asymptotic scaling comes about .",
    "this is of particular relevance to the regime @xmath7 , for which the logarithmic divergence in time of the mean squared displacement is indeed very slow .",
    "our results are tested and confirmed by numerical simulations of the processes under consideration .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in",
    ", we introduce the multi - state description of lvy walks with respect to scattering and propagating states , and define the transition probabilities between them in terms of two parameters , one relating to the probability of a transition from a scattering to a propagating state and the other characterizing the asymptotic scaling of the free path distribution .",
    "the fraction of particles in a scattering state evolves according to a delay differential equation which is derived and solved in .",
    "these results are exploited in to obtain the mean squared displacement of the processes . a comparison with numerical simulations",
    "is provided in .",
    "conclusions are drawn in .",
    "we consider a continuous - time random walk on a square lattice which generalizes the standard model of montroll & weiss @xcite in that it assumes displacements to non - neighbouring sites occur in a time span given by the ratio of the distance traveled to the walker s speed @xmath8 , which itself remains fixed throughout . in this sense ,",
    "the model is similar to the so - called velocity picture of lvy walks @xcite , the difference being that successive propagations , irrespective of their lengths , are separated by random waiting times , which we assume have exponential distributions .",
    "the model itself is not new and , in some sense , is a simplification of other models of lvy walks interrupted by rests ; see reference @xcite . as we show below , however , the combination of a discretized spatial structure and exponentially - distributed waiting times yields a novel description of the process in terms of delay differential equations amenable to analytic treatment .",
    "a natural distinction arises between the states of walkers which are moving across the lattice structure and those at rest .",
    "we call _ propagating _ the state of a particle which is undergoing a displacement phase and _ scattering _ the state of a particle at rest , waiting to start a new displacement . in the framework of intermittent random walks",
    "@xcite , the former state is usually referred to as ballistic and the latter as diffusive or reactive , depending on context .",
    "a scattering state may therefore be thought of as one associated with a local diffusive process bound to the scale @xmath9 of the distance between neighbouring lattice sites .",
    "the interplay between the two states is as follows . a particle in a propagating state switches to a scattering state upon completing a displacement .",
    "a particle in a scattering state , on the other hand , can make transitions to both scattering and propagating states ; as soon as its randomly - distributed waiting time has elapsed , it moves on to a neighbouring site and , in doing so , may switch to a propagating state and continue its motion to the next site , or start anew in a scattering state .",
    "consider a @xmath10-dimensional cubic lattice of individual cells @xmath11 .",
    "the state of a walker at position @xmath12 and time @xmath2 can take on a countable number of different values , @xmath13 , specified by an integer @xmath14 , and direction @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes the coordination number of the lattice , that is the number of different lattice directions .",
    "states @xmath17 are associated with a scattering state , irrespective of direction @xmath18 , while states @xmath13 with @xmath19 refer to propagating states , with @xmath20 being the remaining number of lattice sites the walker will travel in direction @xmath18 to complete its displacement .",
    "time evolution proceeds in steps , characterized by a waiting - time density function and a transition probability .",
    "a particle at position @xmath21 in a scattering state will wait for a random time @xmath2 , exponentially distributed with mean stands for residence as in `` residence time . ''",
    "in contrast , b in @xmath22 stands for ballistic as in `` ballistic propagation time . '' ] @xmath23 , before updating its state to @xmath24 with probability @xmath25 , simultaneously changing its location to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 denotes the lattice vector ( of length @xmath9 ) associated with direction @xmath18 .",
    "in contrast , a particle in a propagating state @xmath13 , @xmath19 , will change its state to @xmath28 after a time @xmath29 , simultaneously moving from site @xmath21 to @xmath30 .",
    "the waiting times associated with scattering states are drawn from a standard poisson process , while the renewal process generated by the combination of scattering and propagating states has arbitrary holding times , whose distribution is determined by the transition probabilities @xmath31 .",
    "the waiting - time density of the process is thus the function    @xmath32    where @xmath33 denotes the dirac delta function . when a step takes place , the transition probability to go from state @xmath24 to state @xmath34 is    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the kronecker symbol .",
    "a particle which makes a transition from the scattering state to a propagating state @xmath24 will therefore travel a distance @xmath37 away in direction @xmath18 , until it eventually comes back to the scattering state and may change directions at the next transition .",
    "we now introduce a characterization of the transition probabilities @xmath31 in terms of two parameters .",
    "the first , which we refer to as the _ scattering parameter _",
    ", is denoted by @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and gives the total probability of a transition from the scattering state , @xmath40 , into a propagating state , @xmath41 :    @xmath42    the remaining transition probability ,    @xmath43    is that of a transition from a scattering state into another scattering state .",
    "the value @xmath44 thus corresponds to the absence of propagating states : the process is then a simple continuous - time random walk with transitions to nearest neighbouring sites only and exhibits normal diffusion with coefficient @xmath45 .",
    "the opposite extreme , @xmath46 , assigns zero probability to transitions from scattering to scattering states , which means that every transition involves a displacement over a distance of at least two sites .",
    "scattering states remain populated , however , due to the decay of propagating states .",
    "the second parameter , @xmath47 , is the _ scaling parameter _ of the transition probabilities @xmath31 , which controls their asymptotic behaviour , @xmath48 and determines the scaling law of the mean squared displacement .",
    "the specific form of @xmath31 has no effect on this scaling law , but is does affect the time - dependent properties of the mean squared displacement . to be specific ,",
    "we consider in this paper the following double - telescopic form for the transition probabilities @xmath31 :    @xmath49    \\qquad ( k\\geq1 ) ;    \\label{eq : rhok2}\\ ] ]    its structure is particularly helpful for some of the computations presented below and is motivated by our study of anomalous transport in the infinite - horizon periodic lorentz gas @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the model is slightly different from that presented in reference @xcite , where a simple telescopic structure of the transition probabilities was used .    for future reference",
    ", we define    @xmath50    to be the probability of a transition to a state larger than or equal to @xmath20 , such that , in particular , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and , for the choice of transition probabilities ,    @xmath53.\\ ] ]    we also note the following two identities :    @xmath54 \\big \\ } ,      \\\\      \\sum_{j = 1}^k j \\rho_j & =      \\epsilon ( 1 - 2^{1-\\alpha})^{-1 } [ 1 - ( k + 1)^{2-\\alpha } + ( k +      2)^{2-\\alpha } - 2 ( k+2)^{1 - \\alpha } ] .",

    "<S> of particular interest is the case of rare ballistic propagation , in which case a regime of superdiffusion may lurk underneath one of normal diffusion . </S>"
