    "the effects of a crystal structure transformation due to subtle atomic displacements have attracted much attention because they can lead to drastic changes in the electronic and magnetic properties of solids .",
    "for example , in a number of multiferroic compounds the electric dipole moments typically develop from very small spontaneous deformations in the crystal structure.@xcite the cuprate high - temperature superconductors where superconductivity emerges in the proximity of , or in competition with , a charge - density wave ( cdw ) provide another example of materials where subtle atomic distortions play an essential role.@xcite currently most of the research on the subject is focused on strongly correlated oxides , although it is obvious that such phenomena could occur in intermetallic compounds as well .",
    "charge and spin density waves introduce a new periodicity in intermetallics , thereby breaking the lattice periodicity which defines their band structure .",
    "in particular , the direct evidence of cdw formation was found in ternary rare - earth transition - metal silicides @xmath8ir@xmath9si@xmath10.@xcite the results of the x - ray diffraction confirmed the existence of both incommensurate and commensurate cdw states in these compounds .",
    "the formation of the cdw driven by the nesting of the fermi surface and hosted within te layers was detected in tritellurides @xmath1te@xmath3.@xcite the reduction of the size of the fermi surface at the transition has been studied extensively.@xcite anomalous in the electrical resistivity of nonmagnetic compounds y@xmath11coin@xmath12 , y@xmath11coga@xmath12 and dy@xmath11coga@xmath12 were also proposed to arise due to a cdw - induced anisotropic energy gap at the fermi surface.@xcite moreover , high interest in tiny atomic displacements was reinforced recently when a purely electronic picture of cdw was stringently tested.@xcite the coordinated action of electronic and ionic subsystems , i.e. the electron - phonon correlations was found to be responsible for the cdw instability in prototypical cdw materials cete@xmath3 and mse@xmath11 , m = nb , ta , ti .",
    "binary intermetallic systems containing rare earth metals , such as @xmath0co  ( @xmath1 is rare earth or yttrium ) have been studied for more than three decades for their diversity of interesting properties .",
    "they usually exhibit complicated magnetic behavior , depending on the rare - earth , including metamagnetic transitions,@xcite giant magnetoresistance,@xcite a substantial magnetocaloric effect@xcite and superconductivity.@xcite co ions do not possess any ordered magnetic moment in @xmath0co.@xcite    y@xmath3co  with a nonmagnetic rare - earth site often serves as a reference system in systematic studies over the @xmath0co  series , but is also an interesting system in its own right .",
    "a pronounced anomaly in the temperature dependent resistivity around @xmath4  k was reported more than twenty years ago but its origin was never satisfactorily explained.@xcite the anomaly was discussed in terms of interactions of the localized cobalt magnetic moments that is in contradiction with the later results of magnetic measurements.@xcite a small hump of the specific heat curve around 160  k was also observed but never discussed.@xcite the crystal structure was repeatedly reported to be orthorhombic fe@xmath3c - type structure ( @xmath2 space group ) for entire @xmath0co  series at all temperatures.@xcite thus , the origin of the observed phenomena remained unclear .    in this work , using elastic and inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) and density functional theory ( dft ) calculations , we show that y@xmath3co  undergoes a structural phase transition at @xmath4  k. the formation of this new phase is evident by a pronounced lattice distortion , and heat capacity and resistivity anomalies .",
    "we suggest that the nature of the observed anomalies at @xmath5 may be attributed to the formation of low - dimensional electronic bands with decreased density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level @xmath13 below the transition temperature .",
    "y@xmath3co  samples were prepared by arc melting of the elements in a helium atmosphere .",
    "several single crystals with largest dimensions of approximately @xmath14 mm@xmath15 were grown by remelting the ingots at temperatures just above the peritectic point in a resistance furnace with a high temperature gradient , followed by annealing at 600@xmath16c for 3 days .",
    "neutron single crystal diffraction experiments were performed at the hb-3a four circle diffractometer@xcite at the high flux isotope reactor ( hfir ) and at the cold neutron chopper spectrometer ( cncs)@xcite at the spallation neutron source ( sns ) both at oak ridge national laboratory .",

    "additional heat capacity measurements show that the anomaly has no magnetic field dependence .",
    "also , the inverse magnetic susceptibility curve does not show any peculiarities around 160  k ( fig .  [ cp]c ) .",
    "thus , a magnetic origin of the observed phenomena seems unlikely .",
    "rather , these observations suggest the presence of a temperature - driven structural phase transition in y@xmath3co  at @xmath4  k. concerning the magnetic properties of y@xmath3co , the determination of basic mean - field parameters such as paramagnetic moments and the curie - weiss temperature is difficult ( if not meaningless ) because y@xmath3co  does not follow a curie - weiss law over any long temperature interval . this question was discussed in past ,",

    ". it is well known that at high temperatures a number of elements and intermetallic compounds adopt energetically unstable crystal structures .",
    "for example , the transition metals of groups iii and iv are stable in a bcc phase at high temperatures and transform to hcp upon lowering the temperature.@xcite they exhibit one or several dynamically unstable phonon modes which are characterized by imaginary harmonic frequencies.@xcite these phonon modes are dynamical precursors of the ionic displacements and cause the transition when the temperature is lowered . to check for such a scenario we have studied the dynamical stability of the @xmath2 structure of y@xmath3co  at @xmath30  k. first - principles calculations were performed using the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp)@xcite based on projector augmented wave ( paw ) pseudopotentials @xcite within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) as parameterized by perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe).@xcite after careful convergence tests , a plane wave cutoff energy of 400  ev and an @xmath31 @xmath32-point monkhorst - pack mesh@xcite for the 16-atom unit cell of y@xmath3co  were found to be sufficient to converge the total energy to better than 1  mev / atom .",

    "it turns out that the fermi level situates close to a dos minimum between co 3d and y 4d bands , that means that the second derivative of the density of state is positive .",
    "the combination of first and second derivatives 3[@xmath43 d@xmath44d@xmath45@xmath46 - [ @xmath43 d@xmath47d@xmath48@xmath49 could explain the tendency of temperature dependence of resistivity @xmath25 to saturate , see for instance ref .  .",

    "for instance , the transitions in a strong interchain coupled cdw systems @xmath8ir@xmath9si@xmath10 are characterized by a sharp jumps in the susceptibility and the resistivity as well as by narrow cusp in the specific heat.@xcite we can therefore speculate that the observed structural distortions at @xmath5 in y@xmath3co  also cause the reduction of the electronic bands dimensionality and a decrease of dos at the fermi level .",
    "we should also note that our recent single crystal neutron diffraction measurements on the tb@xmath3co intermetallic compound reveal a superstructure pattern similar that was found in y@xmath3co.@xcite we suggest that some other members of the @xmath0co  series ( or even all of them ) have ground state crystal symmetry lower than @xmath2 .",
