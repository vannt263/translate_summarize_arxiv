    "( charge - conjugate particles and decays are implied . )",
    "let @xmath20 be any of these pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "to lowest order , the decay width is @xmath21    here @xmath22 is the @xmath20 mass , @xmath23 is the @xmath24 mass , @xmath25 is the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element between the constituent quarks @xmath26 in @xmath20 , and @xmath27 is the fermi coupling constant .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 is the decay constant , and is related to the wave - function overlap of the quark and antiquark .",
    "the decay @xmath28 starts with a spin-0 meson , and ends up with a left - handed neutrino or right - handed antineutrino . by angular momentum conservation , the @xmath29",
    "must then also be left - handed or right - handed , respectively . in the @xmath30 limit",
    ", the decay is forbidden , and can only occur as a result of the finite @xmath24 mass .",
    "this helicity suppression is the origin of the @xmath31 dependence of the decay width .",
    "there is a complication in measuring purely leptonic decay rates .",
    "the process @xmath32 is not simply a radiative correction , although radiative corrections contribute .",
    "the @xmath20 can make a transition to a virtual @xmath33 , emitting a real photon , and the @xmath33 decays into @xmath34 , avoiding helicity suppression .",
    "the importance of this amplitude depends on the decaying particle and the detection technique . the @xmath35 rate for a heavy particle such as @xmath7 decaying into a light particle such as a muon can be larger than the width without photon emission @xcite . on the other hand , for decays into a @xmath36 ,",
    "the helicity suppression is mostly broken and these effects appear to be small .",
    "measurements of purely leptonic decay branching fractions and lifetimes allow an experimental determination of the product @xmath37 .",
    "if the ckm element is well known from other measurements , then @xmath5 can be well measured .",
    "if , on the other hand , the ckm element is not well measured , having theoretical input on @xmath5 can allow a determination of the ckm element .",
    "the importance of measuring @xmath38 depends on the particle being considered . in the case of the @xmath39",
    "the measurement of @xmath40 provides an indirect determination of @xmath41 provided that @xmath6 is provided by theory .",
    "in addition , @xmath6 is crucial for using measurements of @xmath42-@xmath43 mixing to extract information on the fundamental ckm parameters .",
    "knowledge of @xmath44 is also needed , but it can not be directly measured as the @xmath45 is neutral , so the violation of the su(3 ) relation @xmath46 must be estimated theoretically .",
    "this difficulty does not occur for @xmath47 mesons as both the @xmath13 and @xmath18 are charged , allowing the direct measurement of su(3 ) breaking and a direct comparison with theory .",
    "for @xmath39 and @xmath18 decays , the existence of a charged higgs boson ( or any other charged object beyond the standard model ) would modify the decay rates ; however , this would not necessarily be true for the @xmath13 @xcite . more generally , the ratio of @xmath48 to @xmath49 decays can serve as one probe of lepton universality @xcite .",
    "as @xmath50 has been quite accurately measured in super - allowed @xmath51 decays @xcite , with a value of 0.97425(22 ) @xcite , measurements of @xmath52 yield a value for @xmath53 .",
    "similarly , @xmath54 has been well measured in semileptonic kaon decays , so a value for @xmath55 from @xmath56 can be compared to theoretical calculations .",
    "lattice gauge theory calculations , however , have been claimed to be very accurate in determining @xmath57 , and these have been used to predict @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "we review current measurements , starting with the charm system .",
    "the cleo collaboration has performed the only measurement of the branching fraction for @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "cleo uses @xmath59 collisions at the @xmath60 resonant energy where @xmath61 pairs are copiously produced .",
    "they fully reconstruct one of the @xmath47 s , find a candidate muon track of opposite sign to the tag , and then use kinematical constraints to infer the existence of a missing neutrino and hence the @xmath62 decay of the other @xmath47 .",
    "they find @xmath63 .",
    "we use the well - measured @xmath13 lifetime of 1.040(7 ) ps , and assuming @xmath64 equals @xmath65 @xcite minus higher order correction terms @xcite , we find @xmath66 .",
    "the cleo branching fraction result then translates into a value of @xmath67 this result includes a 1% correction ( lowering ) of the rate due to the presence of the radiative @xmath68 final state based on the estimate by dobrescu and kronfeld @xcite .",
    "before we compare this result with theoretical predictions , we discuss the @xmath18 . measurements of @xmath9 have been made by several groups and are listed in table  [ tab : fds ] @xcite .",
    "we exclude older values obtained by normalizing to @xmath18 decay modes that are not well defined .",
    "many measurements , for example , used the @xmath69 mode .",
    "this decay is a subset of the @xmath70 channel which has interferences from other modes populating the @xmath71 mass region near the @xmath72 , the most prominent of which is the @xmath73 .",
    "thus the extraction of effective @xmath69 rate is sensitive to the mass resolution of the experiment and the cuts used to define the @xmath72 mass region @xcite .",
    "the cleo , babar and belle @xmath74 results rely on fully reconstructing all the final state particles except for the neutrino and using a missing - mass technique to infer the existence of the neutrino .",
    "cleo uses @xmath75 collisions at 4170 mev , while babar and belle use @xmath76 collisions at energies near the @xmath77 .",
    "when selecting the @xmath78 and @xmath79 decay modes , cleo uses both calculation of the missing - mass and the fact that there should be no extra energy in the event beyond that deposited by the measured tagged @xmath80 and the @xmath81 decay products .",
    "the @xmath82 mode , however , uses only extra energy .",
    "babar measures @xmath83 using the @xmath84 mode .",
    ".experimental results for @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath9 .",
    "numbers for @xmath9 have been extracted using updated values for masses and @xmath87 ( see text ) .",
    "systematic uncertainties for errors on the @xmath18 lifetime and mass are included ; radiative corrections have been included .",
    "common systematic errors in the cleo results have been taken into account .",
    "[ tab : fds ] [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     there are large backgrounds under the signals in all cases .",
    "the systematic errors are also quite large , on the order of 20% .",
    "thus , the significances are not that large .",
    "belle quotes 3.5@xmath88 and 3.6@xmath88 for their hadronic and semileptonic tags , respectively , while babar quotes 3.3@xmath88 and 2.3@xmath88 , again for hadronic and semileptonic tags .",
    "we note that the four central values are remarkably close to the average considering the large errors on all the measurements .",
    "more accuracy would be useful to investigate the effects of new physics .",
    "we extract a sm value using eq .",

    "theory provides a value of @xmath89 mev @xcite .",
    "we also need a value for @xmath41 . here",
    "significant differences arise between using inclusive charmless semileptonic decays and the exclusive decay @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "the inclusive decays give rise to a value of @xmath91 while the exclusive measurements yield @xmath92 , where the errors are dominantly theoretical @xcite .",
    "their average , enlarging the error in the standard manner because the results differ , is @xmath93 .",
    "using these values and the pdg values for the @xmath19 mass and lifetime , we arrive at the sm prediction for the @xmath94 branching fraction of @xmath95 .",
    "this value is about a factor of two smaller than the measurements .",
    "there is a 6.6% probability that the data and the sm prediction are consistent .",
    "this difference is more clearly seen by examining the correlation between the ckm angle @xmath51 and @xmath96 .",
    "the ckm fitter group provides a fit to a large number of measurements involving heavy quark transitions @xcite . the point in fig .",
    "[ sin2b_btaunu ] shows the directly measured values , while the predictions from their fit without the direct measurements are also shown .",

    "we now discuss the determination of charged pion and kaon decay constants .",
    "the sum of branching fractions for @xmath99 and @xmath100 is 99.98770(4)% .",
    "the two modes are difficult to separate experimentally , so we use this sum , with eq .",

    "the second is due to the higher - order corrections , and is much larger .",
    "similarly , the sum of branching fractions for @xmath102 and @xmath103 is 63.55(11)% , and the lifetime is 12.3840(193 ) ns @xcite . measurements of semileptonic kaon decays provide a value for the product @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the form - factor at zero four - momentum transfer between the initial state kaon and the final state pion .",
    "we use a value for @xmath104 of 0.21664(48 ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath105 must be determined theoretically .",
    "we follow blucher and marciano @xcite in using the lattice calculation @xmath106 @xcite , since it appears to be more precise than the classic leutwyler - roos calculation @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "[ other recent averages are @xmath108 @xcite and @xmath109 @xcite . ] using the value from ref .",
    "@xcite , the result is @xmath110 , consistent with the hyperon decay value of @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "we derive @xmath112    the first error is due to the error on @xmath113 ; the second is due to the ckm factor @xmath54 , and the third is due to the higher - order corrections .",
    "the largest source of error in these corrections depends on the qcd part , which is based on one calculation in the large @xmath114 framework .",
    "we have doubled the quoted error here ; this would probably be unnecessary if other calculations were to come to similar conclusions .",
    "a large part of the additional uncertainty vanishes in the ratio of the @xmath115 and @xmath116 decay constants , which is @xmath117      these measurements have been used in conjunction with calculations of @xmath118 in order to find a value for @xmath119 .",
    "three recent lattice predictions of @xmath118 are @xmath120 @xcite , @xmath121 @xcite , and @xmath122 @xcite , yielding an average by the flag group of @xmath123 @xcite .",
