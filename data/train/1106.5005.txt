    "one way around this issue is to distribute the ions over an array of harmonic potentials , where the number of ions in each trapping potential can remain small .",
    "the potentials can be adjusted temporally to transport the ions throughout the array and combine selected ions into a particular harmonic potential .",
    "once combined , gate operations can be performed on the selected ions by use of a local shared mode of motion  @xcite .",
    "initial demonstrations of such distributed architectures have incorporated simple linear arrays  @xcite , where all ions are confined in potential minima on a line along an axis of the trap .",
    "the order of ions within the linear array can even be changed  @xcite . however , multidimensional arrays  @xcite provide the greatest flexibility in ion - trap processor architectures , and permit more efficient reordering of ion strings for deterministic gate operations .",
    "the key technical element that must be realized towards this end is the two - dimensional junction , which consists of multiple intersecting linear arrays .",
    "the potentials in a junction are more complicated than those in a linear array , making transport through a junction challenging .",
    "since the fidelity of the gates is highest if the ions are near their motional ground state , it is important that transport through such arrays be performed reliably and with minimal excitation of the ion s motion in its local trapping potential .",
    "if multiple transports are needed , each transport should contribute well under a single quantum of motional excitation , though sympathetic cooling can be used to remove excess motional energy , at the cost of increased experiment duration ( and accompanying decoherence )  @xcite .",

    "this barrier was positioned just above the trap electrodes , extending 1.6  cm along @xmath11 out of the plane of the page .",
    "additional laser access was available for beams passing through @xmath10 ( at 45@xmath33 to the @xmath34 plane ) allowing for cooling , detection , and gate operations at @xmath10 . ]",
    "ions were loaded into the array from a flux of neutral be that passed through @xmath19 and was photoionized with a mode - locked laser that after two stages of doubling produced 235  nm resonant with the s - to - p transition of neutral be . to help prevent buildup of neutral",

    "transporting ions through such @xmath37 bends is relatively straightforward , and we were able to easily transport ions between @xmath19 and @xmath10 .    whenever an ion was lost , a new ion was loaded into @xmath19 and immediately transferred to @xmath10 .",
    "it was also possible to use zone  @xmath19 as a reservoir zone , where extra ions were loaded and held in reserve until needed to replace ions lost in the experiment region .",
    "this allowed the loading process to be performed less often , which avoided heating the neutral be oven and the concomitant degradation of the vacuum .",

    "the first demonstrations of ion transport in a multi - zone trap involved moving an ion along a linear array  @xcite . a protocol where two ions were placed in a single trapping well and separated into two wells or combined from two wells into a single well",

    "this same basic procedure would be generally applicable to many ion - transport situations .",
    "the goal was to move ions quickly , over long distances , while maintaining low excitation of the ion s secular motion in its local potential , and traversing non - trivial potential landscapes such as those near junctions .",
    "ideally , the ion should move along the axial direction of the array while remaining at the transverse pseudopotential minimum .",
    "the control electrodes were used to create an overall harmonic trapping well whose minimum moved along this desired trajectory . the procedure for determining waveforms",
    "can be broken down into four steps : modeling the trap , determining the constraints , solving for the appropriate potentials , and assigning the time dependence of potentials .",
    "an electrostatic model of the trap was constructed by use of boundary element method ( bem ) software  @xcite . for each of @xmath38 electrodes ,",
    "the model was run once , applying 1  v to the @xmath39 given electrode while grounding all other electrodes .",
    "the potential resulting from each of these voltage configurations , @xmath40 , was extracted ( in the form of a @xmath41 m grid ) in the region through which the ion would pass .",
    "these individual electrode potentials could then be weighted by the actual voltage applied to the electrode , @xmath42 , and summed to find the total potential : @xmath43 here we have included the contribution of the rf pseudopotential @xmath44 .",
    "the pseudopotential was found by first modeling the rf potential @xmath45 as if it were a _",
    "static _ potential at 1  v. then an additional step was used to convert the rf potential into a time - independent pseudopotential by use of @xmath46 where @xmath47 was the peak voltage applied to the rf electrode , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the charge and mass of @xmath0be@xmath1  , respectively .",

    "this inversion may not be strictly possible , as is the case when the number of constraints does not equal the number of control potentials , leading to an over- or under - determined problem .",
    "also , we are interested only in solutions where the magnitudes of all control voltages are smaller than a maximal voltage @xmath81 ( for our apparatus , @xmath82  v ) .",

    "( [ matrixconst ] ) is under - constrained , as is usually the case for large trap arrays with many electrodes , it returns a null space in addition to @xmath79 , which can be added to @xmath79 to find multiple independent solutions .",
    "nine constraints were used above , but many are unnecessary . for qip in a linear trap array , constraining the axial mode frequency and orientation is often sufficient .",
    "parameters for the other two modes are less important and often achieve reasonable values without being constrained , in which case they can be omitted from the constraint matrices .",
    "in addition to explicitly defined user constraints , there are implicit physical and geometric constraints that must be considered . as an example , take the three secular frequencies of the ion , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "these frequencies result from a hybrid potential that includes both pseudopotential and control potentials .",

    "( an imaginary frequency component would imply antitrapping , while a real component yields trapping . )",
    "the control electrodes produce a quasi - static electric field , which laplace s equation requires to be divergenceless .",
    "this places a physical constraint on the frequencies components due to the control potential , namely @xmath90 .",
    "thus , laplace s equation permits only certain combinations of the secular frequencies . for a _ linear _ paul trap , where @xmath91 , the secular frequencies must obey @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the pseudopotential radial trapping frequency .",
    "the trap geometry can place constraints on the trapping potentials , as well .",
    "for example , in traps where the geometry contains some symmetry , the potentials must preserve that symmetry .",
    "care must be exercised to ensure that user - defined constraints do not contradict physical or geometry constraints , as this will invalidate the solution .    though we invoke only position , frequency , and orientation constraints here , other varieties of user - defined constraints can be easily included with this framework , and a more complete discussion of these constraints is presented in  @xcite .",
    "the constraints used to construct the waveforms in the x - junction array were as follows :    1 .",
    "the position of the potential minimum was constrained in three directions to be at @xmath94 .",
    "one of the principal axes was constrained to lie along the trap axis ( which involves two constraints on axes orientation ) .",
    "the ion axial frequency was constrained ( usually to 3.6  mhz ) .",
    "4 .   the voltages were constrained to be between @xmath95v ( to conform to the limits of the voltage supplies used in the experiment ) .",
    "this relatively sparse set of constraints tended to give good solutions at most locations considered .",
    "item  4 is an inequality constraint that is easily implemented by use of the constrained least - squares method .",
    "when solving waveforms that transport across multiple zones , @xmath79 can become discontinuous from step to step , especially when transitioning between sets of control electrodes .",
    "these jumps occur when an under - constrained problem ( with null space rank @xmath96 ) has multiple linearly - independent solutions and the algorithm returns a different solution from one step to the next : during transport there will be some position at which it is suddenly easier to produce the desired potential using a new combination of electrodes . in principle",
    ", such jumps should not have adverse effects on the potential at the ion , as the potentials on both side of the jump fulfill the same constraints and should transition smoothly .",
    "however , since the potentials on the electrodes are filtered , we would expect the potential at the ion to experience a transitory jump during the transition .",
    "these solution jumps can be handled by various means .",
    "we used the constrained least - squares method to seed each new solution with the solution of the previous step while introducing a cost for deviating from the previous solution by replacing eq .",
    "[ llseqn ] with @xmath97 for a positive constant @xmath98 .",
    "this removes the need for iteratively choosing weights to keep the voltages within bounds , as suggested in ref .",
    "this forced the jump transition to be extended over multiple steps , rather than allowing a discontinuous jump .",
    "another approach is to average the two @xmath79 s on each side of the discontinuity , taking advantage of the linearity of the equations , to produce an intermediate solution that still satisfies the constraints  @xcite .",
    "performing several steps of such averaging will smooth the jump .",
    "alternately , trial and error can often be used to determine a set of constraints that does not produce a jump , but this can require significant effort .",
    "if the spatial interval between steps in the waveform is small enough , the potential , once applied to the electrodes , will move smoothly from step to step  @xcite .",
    "the velocity of the potential well ( and , thus , the ion ) is controlled by the rate at which the waveform steps are updated on the electrodes . in our case ,",
    "the control potentials were supplied by digital - to - analog converters ( dacs ) that had a constant update rate @xmath99  khz and the number of update steps was adjusted to change the velocity .",
    "different velocity profiles have been considered for minimizing excitation while transporting  @xcite . in this report , the ions were usually transported by use of a constant velocity with equally spaced waveform steps .",
    "this could potentially lead to the ion being ` kicked ' as the velocity jumps at the beginning and end of the transport , resulting in motional excitation .",
    "however , these velocity jumps were smoothed by low - pass filters placed on the control potentials ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : dacnoise ] ) .",
    "a smoother ` sinusoidal ' velocity profile was also tested but was abandoned after observing no discernible difference in the amount of motional excitation by use of the different profiles .",
    "this suggests that both transport protocols were well within the adiabatic regime at the speeds used .",
    "low - pass filtering ( 160  khz corner in our case ) can also potentially distort the waveforms when transporting quickly , placing an upper limit on the ion speed .",
    "however , the practical speed limit was set by the combination of the maximum update rate of the digital - to - analog converters and the number of update points required to accurately produce a continuous harmonic potential in the region of the pseudopotential barrier .",
    "this limit was experimentally determined for each waveform by adjusting the number of update points until minimum motional excitation was achieved .",

    "if @xmath204 , the two oscillations would then begin acquiring a relative phase @xmath205 , where @xmath206 is the period spent at @xmath18 . by then quickly transporting away from @xmath18  towards @xmath10 such that the mode axes rotate diabatically by @xmath207 back to their original orientation , the oscillations would project back onto the original oscillator basis . if the wait period is such that @xmath208 ( where @xmath209 is an integer ) , the motion originally in the @xmath36 mode would project back into the same mode . if , however , @xmath210 , then the @xmath36-motion would project into the @xmath101 mode ; that is , the energy would exchange between @xmath36 and @xmath101 modes .",
    "we demonstrated the basic features of this exchange as follows . to tune the @xmath198 and @xmath199 close to degeneracy , an external shim potential with an adjustable amplitude was applied .",
    "the shim potential consisted of various contributions from 17 control electrodes near @xmath18 , each multiplied by the overall scaling factor @xmath211 .",
    "these contributions were selected so that the net shim potential would primarily alter the frequency splitting without significantly affecting other trapping parameters ( such as the position of the trapping minimum and the @xmath212 mode frequency ) .     in the axial mode after an @xmath10-@xmath18-@xmath10  transport , versus the duration at @xmath18 ( wait period ) .",
    "the black trace indicates exchange of energy between the @xmath101 mode , prepared near the ground state ( at @xmath10 ) , and the @xmath36 mode , prepared in a thermal state via doppler cooling .",
    "the smaller blue trace represents the identical preparation , except the transport was performed twice . during the first transport ,",
    "the wait period was set to maximize the energy transfer from the radial mode to the axial mode , followed by returning the ion to @xmath10 .",
    "after re - cooling the axial mode to the ground state , the round - trip transfer was repeated .",
    "the contrast was decreased ( blue trace ) , indicating that less transverse mode energy was available for transfer to the @xmath101 mode and therefore indicating cooling of the @xmath36 mode .",
    "( b ) and ( c ) the exchange contrast and exchange frequency ( respectively ) , plotted versus the shim - potential scaling factor @xmath211 . ]    the black trace in fig .",
    "[ fig : exchange](a ) shows @xmath213 for the axial mode after @xmath10-@xmath18-@xmath10  transport , as the wait period at @xmath18 was varied .",
    "we derive @xmath213 from sideband measurements , as described above , and assume a thermal distribution .",
    "although this assumption may not be strictly valid , it should give a reasonable approximation for @xmath214 .",
    "oscillations between an excited and near - ground state energy are visible .",
    "the projection process began prior to the ion reaching @xmath18 and transport was too slow for the projection to be perfectly diabatic .",
    "thus , the phase of the exchange oscillation in fig .  [ fig : exchange](a ) is not well determined and was observed to depend on both the exchange frequency and the details of the approach to @xmath18 ( including speed and trajectory ) . in practice , it was difficult to maintain a constant phase for more than a few minutes , as drifts in the potential , likely caused by transient charge buildup and dissipation on the electrodes and also pseudopotential amplitude changes , caused the exchange frequency to drift over that time scale .    figure  [ fig : exchange](b ) displays the oscillation contrast @xmath215 for various scaling factors , @xmath211 , of the shim potential , while fig .",
    "[ fig : exchange](c ) gives the frequency of those oscillations versus the shim scaling factor .",
    "in separate experiments , the two mode frequencies at @xmath18 were measured as a function of @xmath211 by driving excitations with an oscillatory potential applied to the control electrodes .",
    "the difference between the two mode frequencies , @xmath216 , was observed to match the oscillation frequency of the exchange process .",
    "figure  [ fig : exchange](c ) suggests @xmath217 is high on the extreme ends of the @xmath211 range , while fig .",
    "[ fig : exchange](b ) shows a reduction in contrast in these regions of high @xmath217 , likely due to the reduction in diabaticity when @xmath217 was large .",
    "this conclusion was supported by the observation that the contrast decreased as the ion transport speed was reduced .",
    "however , there was a maximum speed , above which contrast no longer increased , because other sources of excitation began to obscure the oscillatory signal .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : exchange](b ) , we see that the fringe contrast was also minimized for shim scaling factors near @xmath218 , where @xmath217 was small .",
    "this reduction in contrast can be explained as coinciding with the condition where the initial mode orientation is identical to the rotated mode orientation and thus the modes do not mix when projected , which is a condition not necessarily related to @xmath217 .",
    "( we note that the @xmath211 value for minimum exchange frequency does not match that for minimum contrast . )",
    "unfortunately , it was not possible to verify this , as we could not measure the mode orientation at @xmath18 , due to lack of laser - beam access .    in the case where the energy from the @xmath36 mode was transferred into the @xmath101 mode , the ion could be returned to @xmath10 for a second round of ground - state cooling of the @xmath101 mode . in the experiment ,",
    "the exchange process in @xmath18 was repeated and the results are shown as the blue trace in fig .",
    "[ fig : exchange](a ) , where a noticeable decrease in the ion s axial excitation was observed compared to the first experiment without the second stage of cooling . the small relative phase shift for the two traces in fig .",
    "[ fig : exchange](a ) was due to the slow drift of @xmath217 over the several minutes required to take the two traces .    ideally ,",
    "all of the energy would be transferred from the @xmath36 mode into the @xmath101 mode , and the subsequent cooling of the @xmath101 mode would leave both modes in the ground state , leading to no oscillation during the second trip into @xmath18 . in practice",
    ", complete transfer was inhibited for two primary reasons .",
    "first , the ions were not being transported fast enough to make a clean diabatic projection of the motion onto the switched axes .",
    "second , for complete energy transfer , the projection should be onto axes rotated by @xmath219 .",
    "any other angles would have resulted in incomplete transfer of energy .",
    "attempts were made to adjust additional shims in hopes of realizing configurations closer to @xmath220 . however , as @xmath221 , it , again , becomes difficult to predict the mode orientation with our idealized computer models and we could not experimentally determine the mode axes in @xmath18 .",
    "nevertheless , we observed a clear and easily reproducible reduction in maximum oscillation amplitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig : exchange](a ) ) from @xmath222 to @xmath223 after the second round of cooling , indicating the radial mode energy was being reduced .",
    "the use of additional rounds of exchange followed by cooling reduced @xmath224 further , but after three or four exchange rounds , other sources of excitation offset the energy reduction .",
    "when optimized , this technique might be used to cool all modes of a single ion to the ground state , while having the ability only to ground - state cool a single mode , as for the laser beam configuration used here .",
    "a junction is not required ; all that is needed is a trap that can diabatically change the relevant mode orientations by @xmath219 , which could be possible in many trap configurations .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated that transport through a two - dimensional trap array incorporating a junction can be highly reliable and excite an ion s motion by less than one quantum .",
    "this is a significant improvement over prior work with junction arrays  @xcite and suggests the viability of trap arrays incorporating junctions for use in large - scale ion - based quantum information processing . in addition , we have implemented a mu - metal shield and current stabilization to reduce qubit decoherence .",
    "we have also examined a technique for transferring energy between motional modes .",
    "dac - update noise can be mitigated with the use of more appropriate filters such as the butterworth filters used here and/or faster dac update rates .",
    "noise on the trapping rf potential can result in motional excitation at pseudopotential barriers as described in sec .",
    "[ subsec : rfnoise ] .",
    "the junction design criteria in ref .",
    "@xcite included minimizing these barriers .",
    "however , the results here show that the slope of the pseudopotential barrier is more important than the barrier height for suppressing motional excitation , suggesting that suppression of barrier height may not be a necessary constraint in future designs . also ,",
    "as observed here , with proper rf filtering , significant barrier slopes can be tolerated without causing significant heating .",
    "the technique for determining the waveforms described in this report can be extended to incorporate multiple trapping wells by expanding eq .",
    "( [ matrixconst ] ) to include multiple minima .",
    "transport procedures such as the ion exchange in ref .",
    "@xcite are also amenable to these solving techniques .",
    "separating and combining of trapping wells requires consideration of the potential s quartic term  @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ derivvector ] ) could be expanded to include fourth - order derivatives .    with the use of multiple junctions",
    ", the techniques described here could help provide a path toward transfer of information in a large - scale ion - based quantum processor and enable an increased number of qubits in quantum algorithm experiments . to do this",
    ", waveforms must be expanded to incorporate many trapping wells .",
    "also , it is likely that a sympathetic cooling ion species will need to be co - trapped with the qubit ions to allow removal of the motional excitation from electronic noise , multiple junction transports , and separating and re - combining wells  @xcite . if sympathetic - cooling ions are present , it may be advantageous to transport both ion species through a junction in a single local trapping well .",
    "since the pseudopotential ( and micromotion ) are mass dependent , the qubit and cooling ions will experience different potentials , which could lead to additional motional excitation . if such excitation is excessive , it should still be possible to separate the ions into individual wells by species and pass the different species through junctions separately , followed by recombination .",
