    "hii  regions are the formation sites of massive ob stars . because the main sequence lifetimes of ob stars are @xmath6 , hii  regions are zero age objects compared to the age of the milky way .",
    "they thus reveal the locations of current galactic star formation .",
    "they are the archetypical tracers of galactic spiral structure .",
    "their chemical abundances , moreover , indicate the present state of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and reveal the elemental enrichment caused by the nuclear processing of many stellar generations .",
    "they provide unique and important probes of billions of years of galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) .",
    "individual galactic hii  regions are astrophysically important objects that reveal details of the impact of the star formation process on the ism . knowing the physical properties of hii  region / photo - dissociation region / molecular cloud complexes provides important constraints on the physics of star formation and the evolution of the ism .",
    "modern galactic hii  region surveys began with studies of the palomar optical survey plates @xcite .",
    "radio recombination lines ( rrls ) from galactic hiiregions were discovered in 1965 during the commissioning of the nrao 140 foot telescope ; @xcite detected @xmath7 emission at 6@xmath0wavelength from m17 and oria . because the galactic ism is optically thin at centimeter wavelengths ,",
    "rrl surveys were able to discover large numbers of hiiregions distributed throughout the entire galactic disk .",
    "pioneering rrl surveys were done by , e.g. , reifenstein et al .",
    "1970 , wilson et al . 1970 ,",
    "downes et al .",
    "1980 , caswell & haynes 1987 , and lockman 1989 .",
    "these surveys gave important insights into galactic structure and the spatial pattern of massive star formation .",
    "particularly noteworthy was the discovery of a metallicity gradient across the galactic disk , made apparent by rrl measurements of hiiregion electron temperatures @xcite .",
    "this galactic - scale metallicity gradient placed strong constraints on gce . by the time of the @xcite survey , however , almost all of the reasonably strong radio continuum sources , as revealed by contour maps often drawn by hand , had been observed ; large angular scale surveys for discrete hiiregions using @xmath0-wave rrls as tracers ceased . despite these efforts ,",
    "the census of galactic hii  regions was clearly incomplete .",
    "the advent of modern high - resolution , galactic - scale infrared and radio surveys , coupled with the unprecedented spectral sensitivity of the nrao green bank telescope ( gbt ) , has made the gbt hiiregion discovery survey ( hrds ) possible .",
    "we assembled our target list from the following multi - frequency , large solid angle galactic surveys : the infrared _ spitzer _ galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire ( glimpse : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and mipsgal @xcite , the nrao vla galactic plane survey made in 21@xmath0hiand continuum ( vgps : * ? ? ? * ) , the vla magpis at 20@xmath0continuum @xcite , and the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss : * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "our targets were selected by finding objects that showed spatially coincident 24@xmath1   _ spitzer _ mipsgal and @xmath820@xmath0continuum emission , either from the vgps or the nvss .",
    "our method was not automated , but instead relied on visual inspection of radio and ir emission maps .",
    "we removed known hiiregions , planetary nebulae ( pne ) , luminous blue variables , and supernova remnants ( snrs ) from the target sample using the simbad database .",
    "this criterion is a strong indication that a target is emitting thermally @xcite , and therefore is likely an hii  region or a pne .",
    "warm dust absorbs the far ultraviolet radiation from the exciting star(s ) and re - emits in the ir , whereas plasma ionized by the same star(s ) gives rise to free - free thermal emission at @xmath0-wavelengths .",
    "it is certainly true that the radio continuum can result from a mixture of free - free ( thermal ) and synchrotron ( non - thermal ) emission .",
    "@xcite showed that one can discriminate thermally from non - thermally emitting objects by using the ratio of the infrared to radio fluxes .",
    "the ir / radio flux ratio for hiiregions is typically @xmath4100 times larger than that for non - thermally emitting snrs , so it is easy to to differentiate between the two by eye .",
    "our visual inspection of the ir and radio images should have eliminated all the snrs from our target sample .",
    "sources showing coincident mid - ir and @xmath0-wave continuum emission almost invariably are thermally emitting : 95% of our sample targets show hydrogen rrl emission with line to continuum ratios of @xmath4@xmath9 which together suggests that our targets are emitting thermally .",
    "figure  [ fig : detections ] shows some representative gbt hrds rrl detection spectra together with _ spitzer _",
    "mipsgal 24@xmath1   images of the nebulae with contours of the vgps 20@xmath0continuum emission superimposed .",
    "( the mips detector is saturated in the central region of g32.928 + 0.607 . )",
    "the sensitivity of the gbt and the power of its autocorrelation spectrometer together made the hrds possible . to achieve high sensitivity , we used techniques pioneered by @xcite , who realized that there are 8 h@xmath10 rrl transitions , @xmath11 to @xmath12 , that can be measured simultaneously by the gbt with the acs at 3@xmath0wavelength ( x - band ) .",
    "( the @xmath11 transition , however , is spectrally compromised by confusing , higher order rrl transitions . )",
    "@xcite showed that all these transitions can be averaged ( after they are re - sampled onto the same velocity scale ) to significantly improve the rrl signal - to - noise ratio , thus giving an extremely sensitive x - band h@xmath10 average nebular spectrum .",
    "this observing technique , coupled with the sensitivity afforded by the gbt s aperture , gave us unprecedented spectral sensitivity per unit observing time advantage compared with all previous @xmath0-wavelength rrl surveys of galactic hiiregions .",
    "the vast majority of our detections took only a single offon total power observation .",
    "after gaussian smoothing over 5 channels to a resolution of 1.86@xmath13(to be compared with the @xmath425@xmath14rrl typical line width ) , the r.m.s .",
    "noise for a single offon observation was typically @xmath41@xmath15 .",
    "all details of the hrds observing and analysis techniques , together with a catalog of the source properties , are discussed by anderson et al .",
    "( 2010 , in preparation ) .",
    "we also used the digital continuum receiver to measure the free - free continuum flux for all our hrds targets .",
    "these show a power law distribution for fluxes @xmath16mjy .",
    "below this the fitted power law overestimates the observed distribution which implies that the hrds is complete to a flux limit of @xmath17 . using the stellar fluxes given by @xcite",
    ", we estimate that optically thin hii  regions ionized by single o9 stars within the solar orbit have flux densities @xmath18120@xmath15at 9@xmath19 .",
    "the hrds thus should be finding all such hii  regions and , furthermore , is capable of detecting o3 stars at heliocentric distances of @xmath20@xmath420@xmath5@xcite .",
    "the gbt hrds has doubled the number of known hiiregions in the galactic zone @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "each discovery gives a position and lsr velocity for the nebula .",
    "we detected 602 discrete hydrogen rrl components from 448 target lines of sight , including @xmath465 infrared bubbles found in the _ spitzer _ glimpse survey .",
    "we found 129 multiple velocity component sources ( 29% of the target sample ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : lv_250 ] shows the longitude - velocity distribution of the hrds nebulae , projected onto the galactic plane .",
    "although the hrds found 448 hiiregions , the number of physically distinct nebulae represented by the 602 discrete hydrogen rrl components is not well known .",
    "thermal radio sources can often be resolved into several apparently physically distinct emission regions , each having a somewhat different position and rrl velocity .",
    "furthermore , the most massive star - forming complexes , w43 for example , are extended and fragmented into many sub - clumps of localized star formation , which together can ionize a very large zone .",
    "many of our multiple velocity component targets may be detecting such low density ionized gas in addition to rrl emission from another , physically distinct nebula . here",
    "we follow the convention established by @xcite and assume that each of our 602 rrls is produced by a distinct object .",
    "one should keep in mind , however , that the concept of a `` discrete hiiregion '' may not apply to many of the complex nebulae seen in the inner galaxy .    here",
    "we assume that all the hrds sources are hiiregions .",
    "anderson et al . ( 2010 , in preparation ) show that the level of contamination in the hrds sample by heretofore unknown snrs , pne , luminous blue variables , etc .",
    ", is very small .",
    "this conclusion is based on considerations of galactic structure , scale height , rrl line widths , and the rrl line - to - continuum ratios ( i.e. nebulae electron temperatures ) .",
    "here we use the @xcite catalog as a proxy for the sample of previously known hiiregions .",
    "the @xcite catalog of galactic hii  regions is a compilation of 24 galactic hii  region single - dish , medium resolution ( @xmath4few arcmin ) surveys covering the entire galactic plane .",
    "there is , however , no definitive , complete compilation of all previously detected galactic hiiregions .",
    "our hrds nebulae are new , previously unknown hiiregions because they are not listed in the @xcite compilation , the @xcite survey , the ultra - compact nebulae studied by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , nor are they in the simbad database .",
    "the lsr velocity of each hrds hiiregion maps into a unique galactocentric radius , @xmath21 . using the @xcite rotation curve , figure  [ fig : rgalhist ] shows the azimuthally averaged distribution of galactic hiiregions as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "the filled histogram shows the hrds nebulae ; the open histogram is the total hiiregion sample ( 1276 nebulae : hrds & * ? ? ?",
    "the distribution of hiiregions across the galactic disk shows strong , narrow ( @xmath21@xmath221@xmath5wide ) peaks at galactic radii of 4.25 and 6.00 kpc .",
    "there is still an overall dearth of hiiregions within 4@xmath5radius @xcite . in the @xmath21= 2 to 4@xmath5zone , however , the hrds has found 75 new nebulae , whereas @xcite list only 56 .",
    "the majority of these hrds rrl components appear to be associated with the galactic bar at @xmath21@xmath4 3@xmath5 .",
    "the galactic bar and 3 kpc arm , however , produce large streaming motions that occur throughout the inner galaxy , making all @xmath21determinations that assume circular rotation uncertain inside 4 kpc radius @xcite .",
    "together , figs .",
    "[ fig : lv_250 ] and [ fig : rgalhist ] show that the level of pne contamination in the hrds sample must be minimal . because pne are an old stellar population their galactic orbits are well - mixed .",
    "pne show , therefore , no structure in their galactocentric radial distribution and their galactic longitude - velocity distribution is a scatter plot constrained only by velocities permitted by galactic rotation .",
    "any pne contamination of the hrds sample must therefore be very small , otherwise these interlopers would suppress the unambiguous signal of galactic structure seen in the hrds galactocentric radial and longitude - velocity distributions .",
    "figure  [ fig : ringarms ] shows that the longitude - velocity distribution of the new hrds and previously known hiiregion sample together now give unambiguous evidence for an ordered pattern of galactic structure .",

    "[ fig : ringarms ] are the solid body loci defined by these tangent points and terminal velocities .",
    "these loci trace the over - densities in the hiiregion @xmath23@xmath24 distribution for @xmath27 quite well .",

    "although the near side of the arm , the segment between the sun and the galactic center , is quite prominent , the far side of the arm was only recently discovered by @xcite .",
    "because of this spatial symmetry and its extreme non - circular velocities , the 3 kpc arm provides strong evidence that the milky way is a m=2 barred spiral galaxy @xcite .    knowing that on - going star formation is occurring in the 3 kpc arm",

    "the far side of the arm , in the @xmath30 quadrant , remains almost devoid of nebulae along the arm locus . because the velocities predicted by the expanding ring model will blend with normal galactic rotation velocities in the @xmath31 and @xmath32 quadrants , the hii region clusterings seen along the @xcite ring locus are difficult to interpret .",
