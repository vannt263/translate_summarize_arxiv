    "the  equilibrium \" , or  thermodynamic \" , entanglement in spin systems is a quantification of the degree of non - classicality of the eigenstates of the system ( e.g. @xcite ) . in quantum phase transitions",
    "it can be regarded as a specific order parameter @xcite .",
    "it distinguishes between the classical correlations , produced by interaction , and the purely quantum ones . both types of correlations are contained in multi - point greens functions of the system",
    ". however , there is no simple recipe to separate them .",
    "this problem is exacerbated by the absence of a convenient measure of entanglement for a mixed state of more than two subsystems .",
    "quantum state tomography can reconstruct all qubit states of a general spin system , but the number of required operations grows exponentially with @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "various entanglement measures were expressed through spin correlators in @xcite .",
    "observable  entanglement witnesses \" @xcite or  entanglement estimators \" @xcite were proposed as well . in general , a number of measurements is required to restore the measure of entanglement in equilibrium , though not as large as in the case of quantum state tomography .",
    "equilibrium entanglement is particularly important in the context of adiabatic quantum computing ( aqc ) @xcite . from the equivalence of aqc and standard quantum computing @xcite and the polynomial equivalence of quantum and classical computing in case",
    "when there is no global entanglement@xcite we infer that global entanglement of the ground state is necessary for an efficient aqc .",
    "the equilibrium state of a system is a sum of projectors on its eigenstates .",
    "it is therefore desirable to be able to check that at least some of these project on _ globally entangled _ eigenstates .",
    "the investigation of equilibrium entanglement allows us to shift the focus from the state to the hamiltonian ( e.g. its entanglement - generation ability@xcite ) .",
    "this opens a new venue of investigation .",
    "suppose the hamiltonian of a quantum system can be restored without free parameters from a series of measurements ( which means that the behaviour of the system , including level anticrossings etc , is quantitatively described under the assumption that it is in a thermal equilibrium mixed state produced by this hamiltonian )",
    ". then all the eigenstates of the system can be determined , and their entanglement measures can be computed .",
    "the experimental investigation of equilibrium entanglement along these lines was performed for the sytems of two@xcite and four@xcite flux qubits .",
    "it relied on continuous measurement of the magnetic susceptibility of an @xmath0-qubit system .",
    "the qubits were controlled locally ; the global response was measured , and all the operations were slow on the scale of characteristic qubit times .",
    "the quantification of entanglement in both cases was done  post - mortem \" and showed a high degree of entanglement for the ground and first excited states .",
    "remarkably , the results of @xcite also contain a directly observable ,  in vivo \" 2-qubit entanglement signature , so - called imt deficit ( a difference between the sum of signals from two qubits driven through their degeneracy points separately , and the signal when they pass the co - degeneracy point simultaneously ; the abbreviation comes from the measurement technique employed ) .",
    "it appears in the linear susceptibility , which is proportional to @xmath3 here @xmath4 are the eigenstates of the hamiltonian , and @xmath5 is proportional to the magnetic moment of the @xmath6th qubit in @xmath7-direction .",
    "( the actual formula ( e.g. eqs.(2,3 ) of ref.@xcite ; see also @xcite ) takes into account asymmetries in couplings of qubits to the external field source ; while necessary for the quantitative match to the experiment , it is not conceptually important . ) if the eigenstates are not entangled ( that is , do not contain components differing by two qubit flips in the @xmath7-basis ) , part of this term ( with @xmath8 ) disappears . the only requirement for the observation of this signature is , as we stated above , the ability to manipulate qubits separately and measure the total response of the system .",
    "the linear response measurements will not provide a directly observable signature of equilibrium entanglement with @xmath9 .",
    "the expressions like ( [ eq_rpq ] ) arise in the lowest - order perturbation theory and therefore contain only first - order commutators between the qubit operators ( coming from the expression for the observable , and from the perturbation hamiltonian ) .",
    "therefore @xmath10 can only catch the absence of 2-tangled components , but is insensitive to the higher - order ( e.g. ghz - type ) states .",
    "this is why the appearance of globally entangled eigenstates ( @xmath11 ) in @xcite could be only inferred from the  post mortem \" analysis .    in order to obtain information about entanglement with @xmath9 without reverse - engineering of the hamiltonian ,",
    "one requires @xmath0-point correlators .",
    "in classical case , they can be extracted from the noise fluctuations (  noise of the noise \" ) , but it is not clear yet how and whether this can be generalized to the quantum case .",
    "a more immediate approach is to measure _ nonlinear _ response of a multiqubit system . in practice",
    ", at least quadratic and qubic effects should be observable , thus providing signatures of 3- and 4-qubit equilibrium entanglement .",
    "first consider an @xmath0-point correlator of single - qubit spin operators , @xmath12 , acting on qubit @xmath13 at the moment @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is some eigenstate of the hamiltonian .",
    "the sequence of operators in ( [ eq_c ] ) generally flips @xmath0 spins in the state @xmath16 .",
    "therefore the correlator disappears unless @xmath16 is a superposition of components differing by @xmath0 spins . in general case",
    ", one expects that @xmath17 should disappear or at least diminish in the absence of entangled states involving at least @xmath0 qubits .      in a system of @xmath18 qubits",
    ", every eigenstate of the hamiltonian can be written as a product of states defined on qubit clusters @xmath19 of no more than @xmath18 qubits each ( fig.[fig1-clusters]a ) , @xmath20 in such a way that the qubits from different clusters are not entangled .",
    "here @xmath21 is the set of all qubits in the system ; @xmath22 . since every time we deal with a pure state",
    ", this operation does not produce any problems .",
    "the complement of a cluster @xmath23 we denote by @xmath24 .    for the following , we need to impose on the hamiltonian the +   + * russian - doll condition * ( see fig.[fig1-clusters ] ) : if in any eigenstate @xmath25 qubits @xmath26 , while qubit @xmath27 , then there is no such eigenstate @xmath28 and cluster @xmath29 , that @xmath30 , while @xmath31 .",
    "+ equivalently , it can be stated as follows : if any two clusters @xmath32 have a common qubit , then one of these clusters must be contained in the other ( like russian dolls ) : @xmath33    the russian - doll condition allows us to _ uniquely _ partition the @xmath18-qubit system in equilibrium into _ mutually non - entangled _ clusters ( _ maximal clusters _ ) @xmath34 , @xmath35 each containing no more than @xmath18 qubits ( see fig.[fig1-clusters]c , d ) .",
    "this is a physically plausible picture , and we conjecture that most @xmath0-qubit hamiltonians satisfy the russian - doll condition . establishing the limits of applicability of this conjecture will be the subject of further research .    [ width=8.8cm]graphic1a.eps [ width=8.8cm]graphic1b.eps + [ width=8.8cm]graphic1c.eps [ width=8.8cm]graphic1d.eps    in a system satisfying the russian - doll condition , the existence of a @xmath13-qubit maximal cluster is equivalent to any state of the system being @xmath13-producible ( see ref .. we can therefore say that equilibrium @xmath0-qubit entanglement exists in a system of @xmath36 qubits , if at least one maximal cluster contains at least @xmath0 qubits .",
    "indeed , then in equilibrium the density matrix of the system is a sum of projectors on eigenstates , at least one of which supports @xmath0-qubit entangled clusters .",
    "our goal is to find an observable signature of equilibrium @xmath0-qubit entanglement , that is , an observable physical quantity which will be zero unless the system contains maximal clusters of size @xmath0 .",
    "let us check the handwaving arguments we made around eq.([eq_c ] ) and see whether certain @xmath0-point correlators can be used this way .",
    "returning to ( [ eq_c ] ) , one can easily express it as a sum over the internal labels @xmath37 of the correlators ( @xmath38 ) @xmath39 with the appropriate energy denominators , similar to ( [ eq_rpq ] ) .",
    "( this is done by the repeated insertion in ( [ eq_c ] ) of the closure relation , @xmath40 . )",
    "now let us concentrate on the _ irreducible correlators _ , that is , the ones where no two states @xmath41 coincide .",
    "the term reflects the following property of the correlator ( [ eq_c ] ) .",
    "obviously from the definition , @xmath42 is invariant with respect to the cyclic transpositions of the labels @xmath43 . if some of these labels appear more than once , then @xmath42 is also invariant with respect to shorter cyclic transpositions in substrings , which end in the identical @xmath43 s .    for an irreducible correlator @xmath44",
    "there are two possibilities : either all @xmath0 qubits , on which act the operators @xmath45 , belong to the same maximal cluster @xmath23 , or they belong to different maximal clusters .      in this case the states of the system can be written as @xmath46 etc , where @xmath47 is the complement of @xmath23 : @xmath48 ( this follows from the definition of entanglement and the fact that in any eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath23 and @xmath47 do not contain mutually entangled qubits . ) we therefore obtain @xmath49 ( the kronecker symbol @xmath50 means that the states @xmath51 and @xmath52 coincide on the set @xmath23 ) .",
    "eq.([eq_a ] ) reflects the fact that the states of the qubits _ outside _",

    "this raises an expectation that the method we introduced can provide a directly observable evidence of multiqubit entanglement even in systems of moderate size .",
    "there remain open questions .",
    "first , it is necessary to investigate the requirements to the hamiltonians which satisfy the russian - doll condition .",
    "second , one would like to see explicitly the origin of similarity between @xmath145 and @xmath147 , and investigate whether one can be expressed through the other in some nontrivial limit .",
    "third , it is desirable to develop an experimental protocol , which would allow to extract @xmath147 of the third or fourth order from the measurements and thereby provide a direct evidence of equlibrium multiqubit entanglement .",

    "martin - delgado , k. maruyama , f. nori , v. petrashov , s. rashkeev , t. roscilde , a. tzalenchouk , and j. young for helpful discussions at different stages of this work .",
    "az was partially supported by nserc discovery grant ( canada ) .",
    "we start with the liouville equation for the density matrix , @xmath148 , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where the unperturbed hamiltonian of @xmath18 flux qubits and the perturbation are @xmath149 the factors @xmath150 answer e.g. for the inhomogeneous external magnetic field distribution in the system .",
    "the equilibrium entanglement we are going to probe is created by the unperturbed hamiltonian , @xmath151 .",
    "( of course , the following discussion is applicable to any system described by the pseudospin hamiltonian ( [ eq_pseudospin ] ) . )    iterating eq.([eq1 ] ) , one obtains the standard expansion of the density matrix over the commutators of @xmath152 and @xmath153 ( unperturbed density matrix @xmath153 is time - independent and commutes with @xmath151 , but it does not have to be an equilibrium density matrix for @xmath151 ) .",
    "the expansion @xmath154 leads to the corresponding expansion for the magnetic moment of the system , @xmath155    one can measure different components of the magnetization and apply several components of the perturbation . here",
    "we consider the situation closest to the 2- and 4-qubit setup of @xcite , where both the external field , and the measured magnetic moment are along @xmath7-axis .",
    "for simplicity we also assume that all @xmath156 s are the same .",
    "the linear term in the expansion of @xmath157 is related to 2-tanglement and was treated in @xcite .",
    "the first new term is @xmath158 , @xmath159,\\sz_k(t'')\\right]\\right\\ } =    \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!dt'\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!dt '' \\x2(t - t',t - t '' ) h(t')h(t '' ) ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the quadratic susceptibility @xmath160 is @xmath161,\\sz_k(t'')\\right]\\right\\}. \\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      we can rewrite ( [ eq2 ] ) using the eigenstates of @xmath151 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 : @xmath167,\\sz_k(t'')\\right]\\nr,\\ ] ] where all operators @xmath168 are in the interaction representation .",
    "opening the commutators , using the closure relations , taking the fourier transform and doing the usual algebra , we finally obtain : @xmath169.\\ ] ] we introduced the weight factors @xmath170 and the formfactors @xmath171 obviously , @xmath172 , and @xmath173 .    in the setup of @xcite",
    "the frequency of the @xmath174-tank , at which the susceptibility is measured , is orders of magnitude less than the tunneling and coupling frequencies ( @xmath175 mhz vs. @xmath176 ghz ) .",
    "the interlevel spacings are at least @xmath177 . therefore if @xmath178 we can use the static limit : @xmath179 where @xmath180 means that terms with @xmath181 are excluded . separating the contributions with both @xmath182 yields @xmath183 here",
    "@xmath184 means that the terms with @xmath185 are excluded .",
    "the rest are the terms where either @xmath186 or @xmath187 , and since @xmath188 they contribute @xmath189 bringing together all the terms , we finally obtain the low - frequency limit for the quadratic susceptibility : @xmath190    the meaning of the two terms in eq.([eq_lf_chi ] ) is different .",
    "indeed , consider a system of noninteracting qubits .",
    "then the eigenstates are completely factorized , @xmath191 and the state of the @xmath6th qubit is either @xmath192 ( ground ) or @xmath193 ( excited ) , with energy @xmath194 .",
    "denoting by @xmath195 the switched state ( @xmath196 ) , we obtain for @xmath197 @xmath198 that is , the sum of single - qubit susceptibilities . on the other hand , one can check that @xmath199 is exactly zero for the system of independent qubits .",
    "moreover , the summation restrictions in ( [ eq_lf_chi ] ) mean that the coefficients @xmath200 can be replaced by the irreducible correlators ( [ eq_global ] ) of the operators @xmath201",
    ": @xmath202 therefore the function @xmath203 will disappear in the thermodynamic limit in the absence of entangled 3-qubit clusters .",
    "thus it provides an observable signature of 3-tanglement@xcite .",
    "( note that for @xmath204 the contribution from the disjoint correlators is exactly zero , due to cyclic invariance . )",
    "this signature can be extracted from the measurements by detecting the second harmonic generation when one , two etc qubits are near the co - degeneracy point and comparing the outcomes , much like it was done with the imt deficit of @xcite .",
    "now we can introduce the @xmath0-th order signature , eq.([eq_z ] ) .",
    "the functions @xmath205 are related to directly observable global nonlinear response of the system : the measurable quantity @xmath206@xcite is thus proportional to @xmath207 the same way the observed imt deficit of ref.@xcite is proportional to @xmath208 .",
    "we saw that the @xmath209-functions are asymptotically zero in the thermodynamic limit , unless the system contains a finite proportion of entangled clusters of at least @xmath0 qubits each ; they are also directly related to the irreducible contribution to the corresponding static nonlinear susceptibilities . therefore the functions ( [ eq_z],[eq_z2 ] ) can indeed serve as observable entanglement signatures .",
