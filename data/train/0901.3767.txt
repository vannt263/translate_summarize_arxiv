    "the problem of the fluid flow past an obstacle is of great importance for both normal fluids and superfluids . in dynamics of viscous compressible fluids",
    "it is closely related to the theory of viscous shocks ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the theory of surface water waves it has lead to the development of a detailed description of ship waves and corresponding drag forces ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in superfluid dynamics ,",
    "understanding of the nature of the critical velocity in the flow past an obstacle was crucially important for the development of the superfluidity theory @xcite .",
    "therefore it is natural that this problem has attracted much interest in the context of dilute gaseous bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) dynamics where formation of dispersive shocks and `` ship waves '' has been studied both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "so far the main attention was paid to physically multi - dimensional problems which in some cases could be asymptotically reduced to effectively one - dimensional ( 1d ) models for the purposes of mathematical convenience . however , there exist essentially 1d situations when the phenomena observed are specific to the 1d case only ( see , for instance , the discussion in @xcite )",
    ". one of such prototypical problems arises in the description of the water flow over a bottom ridge @xcite . in the bec context ,",
    "a similar problem arises in the study of the bec flow induced by a penetrable barrier moving through an elongated bec , as it has been recently studied in the experiment @xcite .",
    "the most characteristic phenomenon observed in this experiment is that a chain of dark solitons is generated for a finite interval , @xmath0 , of the barrier velocities @xmath1 .",
    "the existence of certain threshold velocity @xmath2 agrees with the main concepts of the superfluidity theory introduced by landau @xcite and with earlier experiments @xcite on the appearance of a critical velocity for an `` impenetrable '' obstacle moving through the condensate at different velocities .",
    "taking into account the fact that formation of vortices is impossible in a quasi - one - dimensional setting , one can easily deduce from the dispersion relation for linear bogoliubov excitations in weakly non - ideal bose gas that the critical velocity @xmath2 coincides with the sound velocity , and this conclusion was confirmed by the experiment @xcite .",
    "however , nonlinear effects modify considerably the landau criterion based on the idea of the generation of linear excitations at velocities greater than the critical one .",
    "for example , in the case of wide smooth potentials used in @xcite one has to take into account nonlinear effects which make possible the generation of nonlinear excitations ( dark solitons ) and which reduce the critical velocity @xmath2 to a subsonic value @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that this nonlinear mechanism is effective for a finite interval of the barrier velocities only . as was first noticed in @xcite , there exist such special forms of the barrier potential that no radiation is generated at supersonic velocities greater than the second critical velocity @xmath3 , and this result was confirmed numerically for the potentials of a more general form . as was noted in @xcite , while generically some linear radiation still exists for @xmath4 , its amplitude decreases exponentially with the growth of the ratio of the obstacle size to the healing length so that `` broad and smooth '' potentials can always be considered as `` radiationless '' outside the interval @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "these results were also confirmed by the numerical simulations of waves generated by a supersonic motion of a repulsive rectangular potential @xcite and oscillatory supersonic motion of the gaussian potential @xcite .",
    "thus , for smooth wide penetrable potentials the production of solitons is effective only in a finite range of the barrier velocities . in the present paper , motivated by the results of the experiment @xcite and the theoretical setting of @xcite",
    ", we develop full asymptotic theory of the transcritical bec flow for the case of broad repulsive potentials .",
    "although the experiment @xcite was performed with a dense bec for which the radial motion of the gas is essential , we shall confine ourselves here to the case of a rarefied gas with a frozen radial motion when the full gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation can be reduced to the 1d nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this limiting case reproduces all the main characteristic features of the phenomenon , it admits exhaustive analytical treatment , and such a setup can be quite suggestive for future experiments .",
    "engels and atherton @xcite considered a wide penetrable barrier moving with constant speed through an elongated bec confined to a cigar - shaped trap , as it is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "1 .     direction .",
    "the trap tightly confines the bec in the radial @xmath6 directions.,width=226 ]    [ fig1 ]    in the experiment , the role of the barrier was played by a repulsive potential created by the laser beam which is swept through the bec with the velocity @xmath1 along the @xmath7 direction .",
    "if the condensate is rarefied enough , then its dynamics is described by the forced nls equation which in standard non - dimensional units has the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the moving potential barrier .",
    "it is convenient to transform this equation by means of the substitution @xmath10 to a hydrodynamic - like form and pass to the reference frame moving with the velocity @xmath11 by introducing @xmath12 : @xmath13 here @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the condensate density and velocity , respectively .",
    "it is supposed that in this reference frame and in our non - dimensional units the flow at infinity satisfies the conditions @xmath16 that is the length of the elongated condensate is assumed to be much longer than the size of the wave structures generated in the flow .",
    "thus , equations ( [ 3 - 3])-([3 - 4 ] ) represent an idealized mathematical model for the description of bec dynamics in the configuration of our interest .",
    "the study of the problem ( [ 3 - 3])-([3 - 4 ] ) was initiated in ref .",
    "@xcite where the time - independent flows induced by a slowly varying in space barrier moving with subcritical velocity were analyzed .",
    "unsteady supercritical flows were considered in @xcite numerically and it was noticed there that the results are reminiscent of those for the flow of a stratified fluid over a broad localized topography @xcite . in @xcite the shallow - water flow past topography problem was studied in the framework of the forced korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation , and this approach provides a clue to solving our nls equation problem ( [ 3 - 3])-([3 - 4 ] ) .",
    "the first step in this direction is the study of the stationary solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ 3 - 3])-([3 - 4 ] ) in the case of a wide and smooth potential @xmath17 so that the dispersion terms in ( [ 3 - 3 ] ) can be neglected and one can take advantage of the so - called `` hydraulic '' or `` hydrostatic '' approximation .",
    "let the potential @xmath17 be localized in the interval @xmath18 , where @xmath19 ( i.e. the spatial range of the potential in dimensional units is supposed to be much greater that the healing length of the bec ) .",
    "then one can make use of the hydraulic approximation by assuming that the characteristic length at which all variables change has the order of magnitude of @xmath20 .",
    "thus one can neglect the terms with the higher derivatives in ( [ 3 - 3 ] ) and consider the stationary solutions described by the system @xmath21 where we have omitted primes for convenience of the notation .",
    "actually , these are equations for the stationary hydraulic flow in the reference frame with the barrier at rest ( we note that the flow direction in our paper is opposite to that in @xcite ) .",
    "both equations ( [ 4 - 2 ] ) are readily integrated once to give @xmath22 where the integration constants are found from the boundary conditions ( [ 3 - 4 ] ) . equations ( [ 4 - 3 ] ) thus define a stationary flow that connects smoothly to @xmath23 , @xmath24 at both infinities .",
    "eliminating @xmath14 we obtain an implicit equation for the flow velocity @xmath15 as a function of @xmath25 , @xmath26 for ( [ 4 - 4 ] ) to have a solution defined for all @xmath25 one should require that @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "indeed , the function @xmath29 varies within the interval @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "so for the equation ( [ 4 - 4 ] ) to have a real solution for all @xmath25 the interval @xmath32 $ ] must lie within the range of the function @xmath29 ( the condition ( [ ineq ] ) in the present superfluid context was obtained in @xcite but can also be found in earlier studies on shallow - water flows past topography  see , for instance @xcite ) .    ; for @xmath33 the critical values are equal to @xmath34.,width=302,height=188 ]    [ fig2 ]    inequality ( [ ineq ] ) defines the subcritical @xmath35 and supercritical @xmath36 regimes where @xmath37 are the roots of the equation ( see fig .",
    "2 ) @xmath38 and we have @xmath39 for @xmath40 . if @xmath41 , then @xmath37 must be close to unity so one can easily find that up to the second order in the small parameter @xmath42 the critical velocities are equal to @xmath43 in the _ transcritical _ regime @xmath44 condition ( [ ineq ] ) does not hold so it is natural first to look closer at what happens with the hydraulic solution when @xmath1 approaches its boundaries from outside .",
    "we now look at the dependence of the flow velocity @xmath45 and the density @xmath46 on the space coordinate @xmath25 determined by equations ( [ 4 - 3 ] ) , ( [ 4 - 4 ] ) which can be re - written as @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively .",
    "formally , the solution to ( [ 5 - 7 ] ) ( or ( [ 5 - 8 ] ) ) has two branches only one of which satisfies the necessary boundary conditions ( [ 3 - 4 ] ) so just this branch should be considered as the physical one .",
    "these two branches of the solution for the flow velocity @xmath45 are plotted in fig .  3 for the case of the potential @xmath49 with @xmath33 , @xmath50 , for which eq .  ( [ 5 - 4 ] ) yields @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "we see that the subcritical ( @xmath53 ) and supercritical ( @xmath54 ) hydraulic solutions have similar structure but are characterized by the `` exchanged '' relative positions of the physical and nonphysical branches .     in the hydraulic solution ( [ 5 - 7 ] ) for the potential barrier ( [ 6 - 1 ] ) for which @xmath51 , @xmath52 ; ( a ) corresponds to subcritical velocity @xmath55 and ( b ) to supercritical velocity @xmath56 .",
    "the physical branches are shown by solid lines and nonphysical by dashed lines.,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=188 ]   in the hydraulic solution ( [ 5 - 7 ] ) for the potential barrier ( [ 6 - 1 ] ) for which @xmath51 , @xmath52 ; ( a ) corresponds to subcritical velocity @xmath55 and ( b ) to supercritical velocity @xmath56 .",
    "the physical branches are shown by solid lines and nonphysical by dashed lines.,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=188 ]    [ fig3 ]    in fig .",
    "4 we have plotted two series of hydraulic solutions for different subcritical and supercritical values of the velocity @xmath1 . as one can see ,",
    "the physical and nonphysical families are separated by two separatrices .",
    "when one approaches @xmath57 from below ( fig .",
    "4a ) , the physical branch becomes more and more pointed up at the center of the barrier ( @xmath58 ) , and when @xmath57 , it bifurcates into the separatrix line .",
    "this separatrix solution satisfies the necessary boundary condition @xmath57 as @xmath59 ( effectively at @xmath60 ) but it fails to satisfy the same equilibrium condition at @xmath61 so one can expect that this bifurcation will be accompanied by the generation of an unsteady flow downstream .",
    "indeed , the analysis of the near - critical nls flow through the delta - functional potential @xmath17 in @xcite , @xcite shows that for some @xmath62 the flow loses its stability through the saddle - node bifurcation resulting in the generation of dark solitons for @xmath63 .",
    "the numerical simulations in @xcite also suggest that one can expect a qualitatively similar scenario with the soliton train generation for slowly varying potentials moving with the supercritical velocity .    to describe this generation of solitons in the nls flow past broad potential barrier quantitatively , we shall take advantage of the analytical construction proposed in @xcite , where the transcritical shallow - water flow past extended localized topography was considered in the framework of the forced kdv equation .",
    "the key in this construction is the assumption ( confirmed numerically _ a posteriori _ ) of the existence , for certain interval of the flow velocities , of the local steady _ transcritical _ transition over the forcing region , which is described by the relevant hydraulic solution .",
    "this solution does not satisfy the equilibrium boundary conditions outside the spatial range @xmath64 $ ] of the forcing , so one introduces discontinuities at @xmath65 , which are resolved into the equilibrium state with the aid of unsteady nonlinear wave trains ( undular bores ) . by applying a similar assumption here for @xmath57",
    "we consider the described above separatrix hydraulic solution as a local one defined on the interval @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "then we get a discontinuity at @xmath67 , which should be further resolved into the undisturbed state @xmath68 as @xmath69 via the _ dispersive shock wave_. thus , when the bec flow velocity is equal to @xmath57 , the formation of the dispersive shock downstream the potential barrier is expected .    in a similar way , when we get closer to @xmath70 from above ( fig .",
    "4b ) , the physical solution becomes pointed down , and at @xmath70 it bifurcates into the separatrix line which satisfies the boundary condition @xmath71 as @xmath72 ( effectively at @xmath67 ) and a discontinuity @xmath73 occurs at the left edge @xmath60 .",
    "hence , in this case @xmath70 we expect the formation of the upstream dispersive shock .",
    "one should note that in the nls dispersive hydrodynamics a general discontinuity resolves into a certain combination of two waves : dispersive shock(s ) and/or rarefaction wave(s ) .",
    "the actual combination depends on the relation between the specific initial jump values for the density and velocity @xcite .",
    "the closure conditions enabling one to single out the unique combination in our problem will be formulated in the next section .",
    "thus , one can suggest that in the two limiting cases @xmath74 the full solution can be built of two parts : the steady hydraulic transition solution defined within the spatial range of the potential barrier and the unsteady dispersive shock / rarefaction wave combination at one of the sides of the barrier .",
    "since the dispersive shock is generated essentially outside the spatial range of the potential , one can use the potential - free nls equation for its description and take advantage of the theory developed in @xcite on the basis of the original gurevich - pitaevskii approach using the whitham method of slow modulations @xcite .",
    "this modulation theory of the nls dispersive shocks was recently applied to the description of dispersive shocks in freely expanding becs in @xcite .",
    "[ fig4 ]    generally we are interested in the flow corresponding to the _ transcritical _ region @xmath75 so one can expect formation of both upstream and downstream discontinuities with their further dispersive resolution into the undisturbed states at @xmath76 . to be precise",
    ", we expect a subcritical jump upstream , a supercritical jump downstream and the exact criticality at the top of the potential .",
    "one should emphasize that the suggested description of the transcritical bec flow as a combination of local hydraulic solution connected with the equilibrium state at infinities by unsteady dispersive shock(s ) is an _ assumption _ which should be validated by the comparison of the analytical solution with direct numerical simulations for a range of the oncoming flow / potential barrier parameters .",
    "as we shall see , this assumption works very well when the oncoming flow velocity is not too close to the transcritical region boundaries @xmath77 .",
    "the reason for that is clear : if the speed @xmath1 is close to one of its critical values @xmath77 , the characteristic relaxation time is expected to be very large ( see @xcite for the bifurcation scaling analysis in the case of the delta - functional potential ) so the local transcritical steady flow does not establish in finite time .",
    "nevertheless , it is instructive to perform the analysis , based on the above assumption , for the whole range of velocities in the interval @xmath5 $ ] and then see how well this approximation works for different parameter values .",
    "we denote the values of the density and velocity at the boundaries @xmath65 of the hydraulic solution as @xmath78 and @xmath79 we assume that the potential maximum is located at @xmath58 , i.e. @xmath80 . the transcritical hydraulic solution of our interest is then distinguished by two sets of conditions : @xmath81 @xmath82 where @xmath83 are the values of @xmath15 and @xmath14 at @xmath58 . as we shall see the condition ( i ) actually coincides with the requirement that @xmath84 is equal to the local sound velocity at the top of the potential ( exact criticality ) .",
    "now we take the solution of the hydraulic equations ( [ 4 - 2 ] ) in the general form @xmath85 @xmath86 being arbitrary constants , so that instead of ( [ 4 - 4 ] ) we obtain @xmath87 differentiating ( [ 7 - 4 ] ) we obtain @xmath88 applying condition ( [ crit ] ) we get @xmath89 combining this relation with the first integral ( [ 7 - 3 ] ) applied to the point @xmath58 yields @xmath90 which simply means that the local sound velocity at @xmath58 is @xmath91 .    substituting ( [ 7 - 5 ] ) , ( [ 7 - 6 ] ) into the second integral ( [ 7 - 3 ] )",
    "gives the value of @xmath92 : @xmath93 on the other hand , the integrals ( [ 7 - 3 ] ) applied to the upstream and downstream boundaries @xmath94 where @xmath95 yield the relations @xmath96 eliminating @xmath84 we get three equations @xmath97 for four quantities",
    "@xmath98 . obviously , the last equation can be replaced by @xmath99 that is @xmath100 and @xmath101 satisfy the same set of equations .",
    "one more equation is needed for closing the system , and this will be obtained in the next subsection .",
    "once @xmath102 and @xmath103 are found , the integration constants @xmath104 and @xmath92 in ( [ 7 - 3 ] ) are expressed as @xmath105 hence , the transcritical hydraulic solution ( [ 7 - 3 ] ) is given by @xmath106 @xmath107 at the boundaries @xmath74 of the transcritical region , where either @xmath108 or @xmath109 , equations ( [ 10 - 2 ] ) , ( [ 10 - 3 ] ) , reduce to ( [ 5 - 7 ] ) , ( [ 5 - 8 ] ) respectively as it should be .      to get the closure condition for ( [ 8 - 2 ] ) we shall take advantage of the transition condition across the dispersive shock which is most conveniently formulated in terms of the riemann invariants of the dispersionless hydrodynamic system associated with the nls equation .",
    "this system is obtained from ( [ 3 - 3 ] ) by removing the dispersion and potential terms , @xmath110 and is equivalent to the classical shallow - water equations . introducing the riemann invariants",
    "@xmath111 we represent ( [ 8 - 3 ] ) in the diagonal form @xmath112 in the problem of the decay of an initial discontinuity in the nls hydrodynamics the transition across the dispersive shock is characterized by the zero jump of one of the hydrodynamic riemann invariants ( [ 8 - 5 ] ) @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that this condition is not a small - amplitude approximation of the classical shock jump condition but rather is a non - perturbative consequence of the data transfer along characteristics of the associated whitham modulation system describing dispersive shock region @xcite .",
    "it will transpire later that in the present problem of the right - propagating bec through a potential barrier at rest , the `` conserving '' invariant is @xmath113 ( this corresponds to the waves propagating _ to the left _ which might seem somewhat counter - intuitive with regard to the downstream dispersive shock ) .     as functions of @xmath25 in the hydraulic solution ( [ 10 - 2 ] ) , ( [ 10 - 3 ] ) for the potential ( [ 6 - 1 ] ) with @xmath33 .",
    "note : @xmath114.,width=377,height=226 ]    [ fig5 ]    the upstream dispersive shock is adjacent to the oncoming flow @xmath23 , @xmath24 so the riemann invariant condition yields the relationship @xmath115 which closes the system ( [ 8 - 2 ] ) .",
    "we also recall that we are interested in the solution satisfying condition ( [ ineq1 ] ) which allows one to identify the roots of ( [ 8 - 2 ] ) , ( [ 8 - 6 ] ) as upstream and downstream ones .",
    "now all four values @xmath116 are fixed in terms of @xmath117 , @xmath1 , which , in particular , implies that the downstream discontinuity generally can not be resolved by a single dispersive shock but requires an additional right - propagating rarefaction wave to adjust to the undisturbed flow at @xmath118 .",
    "while the introduction of this rarefaction wave does not present one with a serious technical problem , we shall see that in practical terms this additional complication is not actually necessary .",
    "first we note that , since the matching of the ( external ) hydrodynamic solution and the ( internal ) modulation solution describing dispersive shock is most naturally formulated in terms of riemann invariants ( see @xcite for details ) it is instructive to plot the transcritical hydraulic solution ( [ 7 - 3 ] ) , ( [ 7 - 5 ] ) , ( [ 7 - 7 ] ) in terms of @xmath119 ( the physical branch of the solution is selected using inequalities ( [ ineq1 ] ) ) . the plot in fig .",
    "5 suggests that for weak enough potentials one can neglect the change of @xmath120 across the barrier , which would remove the necessity of introducing an additional rarefaction wave . to justify this supposition we first eliminate @xmath103 from the second equation ( [ 8 - 1 ] ) to represent it in the form @xmath121 introducing the normalized quantities @xmath122 we represent ( [ 1 ] ) as @xmath123 where @xmath124 .",
    "now let us suppose that @xmath125 , which implies @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 .",
    "then from ( [ eq:1a ] ) we get the expansion @xmath129 i.e. the controlling small parameter is again @xmath130 ( note that the coefficients @xmath131 in ( [ vapprox1 ] ) will not contribute to the result so we do not present them explicitly ) .",
    "we now consider the boundary values of the riemann invariant @xmath113 ( [ 8 - 5 ] ) @xmath132 again , normalizing , @xmath133 , and expanding for small @xmath117 we obtain @xmath134 now , taking into account that @xmath135 to leading order , we get @xmath136 thus , for weak potentials the jump of the riemann invariant @xmath120 across the potential has the third order in the controlling small parameter .",
    "this result has certain analogy with the classical result from the shock wave theory which reads that the relevant riemann invariant has just the third order jump across the weak shock @xcite .",
    "the coefficient @xmath137 before @xmath138 suggests that one can neglect the jump of @xmath120 even for the potentials of moderate strength ( of course , provided that the coefficients for the successive powers of the small parameter @xmath42 in the expansion ( [ delta ] ) are reasonably small ) .",
    "indeed , for our potential ( [ 6 - 1 ] ) with @xmath33 we have @xmath139 while according to ( [ delta ] ) @xmath140 i.e. just about @xmath141 , which is confirmed by the numerical transcritical hydraulic solution shown in fig .",
    "so , for weak to moderate potentials one can safely assume that the value of the riemann invariant @xmath113 is preserved across the potential , which allows one to use an additional closure condition @xmath142 relation ( [ 9 - 1 ] ) is asymptotically consistent with exact conditions ( [ 8 - 2 ] ) , ( [ 8 - 6 ] ) and will be especially useful in our further consideration of the dispersive resolution of the downstream discontinuity .",
    "we also note that an immediate implication of ( [ 9 - 1 ] ) is that both upstream and downstream dispersive shocks are `` based '' on the same family of characteristics corresponding to left - propagating hydrodynamic simple waves , which will be essential for the modulation solution in the subsequent sections .",
    "using asymptotic closure conditions ( [ 9 - 1 ] ) one can obtain simple approximate explicit expressions for @xmath103 , @xmath102 in terms of @xmath143 , which will be useful later .",
    "we use ( [ 9 - 1 ] ) to eliminate @xmath103 from ( [ 8 - 2 ] ) to obtain a single equation for @xmath144 , @xmath145^{2/3}=v_m.\\ ] ] this equation has two roots , the larger one corresponds to @xmath146 and the smaller one to @xmath147 ( see ( [ ineq1 ] ) ) .",
    "equation ( [ 9 - 2 ] ) can be solved approximately for @xmath125 .",
    "it is easy to see that for @xmath148 this equation is satisfied if @xmath149 i.e. @xmath150 . in the next approximation",
    "we obtain @xmath151 where we have used that @xmath1 takes its values in the transcritical region ( see ( [ 5 - 6 ] ) ) @xmath152 respectively , with the same accuracy we get from ( [ 9 - 1 ] ) @xmath153 using ( [ 9 - 4 ] ) , ( [ 9 - 5 ] ) we calculate the upstream and downstream values of the riemann invariant @xmath154 , which undergoes discontinuities at both edges of the transcritical hydraulic solution ( see fig .  5 ) , @xmath155 obviously , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , where @xmath158 is the value of @xmath159 for the undisturbed flow at infinity .      summarizing the results of the previous section , we have the following values for the riemann invariants @xmath160 at the boundaries @xmath65 of the hydraulic transition and at @xmath161 : @xmath162 @xmath163 @xmath164 from now on we consider the values @xmath165 as known .",
    "thus , there are upstream and downstream discontinuities in @xmath159 and no discontinuities in @xmath120 .",
    "as was mentioned above , the upstream and downstream discontinuities are resolved through the generation of dispersive shock waves which can be described using modulated periodic solutions of the defocusing nls equation ( [ 3 - 1 ] ) without the barrier potential @xmath166 .",
    "the potential term can be neglected because the shock resolution occurs essentially outside the potential range @xmath167 .",
    "the potential - free nls equation is galilean invariant and hence it preserves its form ( up to inessential in our case phase factor in @xmath168-function ) after the transformation to the reference frame with the barrier at rest which is used in our calculations .    the periodic solution of the nls equation can be written in terms of the condensate density as ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath169 here @xmath170 @xmath171 being the phase velocity and @xmath172 the elliptic modulus , @xmath173 .",
    "the condensate velocity @xmath15 is expressed in terms of density as @xmath174 where @xmath175 the wavelength is expressed in terms of @xmath176 s as @xmath177 @xmath178 being the complete elliptic integral of the first kind .",
    "the parameters @xmath179 change slowly through the dispersive shock and their evolution is governed by the whitham modulation equations @xmath180 so @xmath176 s are the riemann invariants of the whitham equations .",
    "here @xmath181 , @xmath182 are the characteristic velocities which can be expressed in terms of the complete elliptic integrals of the first and the second kind @xcite .",
    "one can use the following convenient formula for the computation of @xmath183 s @xcite @xmath184    the waveform ( [ 11 - 1 ] ) within the dispersive shock wave region gradually changes from the vanishing amplitude harmonic wave at one of the edges to a dark soliton at the opposite edge so that generally the modulus @xmath172 runs over the whole range from @xmath185 to @xmath186 .",
    "the riemann invariants @xmath187 of the whitham equations are matched with the `` external '' hydrodynamic invariants @xmath160 at some free boundaries @xmath188 defined by the conditions @xmath189 ( harmonic edge ) or @xmath190 ( soliton edge ) .",
    "the specific matching conditions and relative position of the harmonic and soliton edges depend on whether one considers the left- or right - propagating dispersive shock ( see @xcite ) . for the left - propagating case of our interest the matching conditions are @xmath191     as functions of @xmath25 in the full hydraulic / modulation solution.,width=377 ]    [ fig6 ]    since dispersive shocks expand with time , their widths at sufficiently large @xmath192 are much greater than the range @xmath20 of the barrier potential , so for @xmath193 one can assume the hydraulic solution to be asymptotically localized at @xmath58 and use the similarity solutions of the whitham equations ( [ 11 - 5 ] ) with only one variable changing through each shock @xcite ( note that the formal condition of applicability of the whitham method itself to the decay of a step problem is @xmath194  see @xcite ) . from the matching conditions ( [ bc ] ) it is clear that the varying invariant should be @xmath195 .",
    "thus , in each dispersive shock the invariants @xmath196 are constant and the invariant @xmath195 varies according to the similarity solution @xmath197 where @xmath198 @xmath199 being the complete elliptic integral of the second kind .",
    "the values of @xmath200 in ( [ 12 - 3 ] ) are fixed and the riemann invariant @xmath201 must have the same constant value @xmath202 in both downstream and upstream dispersive shocks since the value of @xmath120 is transferred through the hydraulic transition ( see ( [ la+ ] ) ) . at the same time , the values of @xmath203 and @xmath204 are different upstream and downstream the barrier so we shall consider the downstream and upstream dispersive shocks separately . before we proceed with the detailed analysis of the dispersive shocks it is instructive to get a picture of qualitative behavior of the riemann invariants in the entire flow .",
    "for that , we use the matching conditions ( [ bc ] ) and the inequality @xmath205 following from the similarity modulation solution ( [ 12 - 2 ] ) and the general property @xmath206 of the characteristic velocities ( [ vi ] ) . as a result , one arrives at the scheme of the behavior of the riemann invariants sketched in fig .",

    "however , the notion of the threshold velocity below which the flow is superfluid has not been changed by this modification of the theory . taking into account the generation of dispersive shocks in 2d situation @xcite did not change this notion either , since the stationary spatial dispersive shocks are generated by the supersonic flow of bec only .",

    "moreover , the lower boundary value of the velocity @xmath2 can become equal to zero for strong enough barriers , that is even very slow motions could lead to the generation of solitons .",

    "<S> the problem of the transcritical flow of a bose - einstein condensate through a wide repulsive penetrable barrier is studied analytically using the combination of the localized `` hydraulic '' solution of the 1d gross - pitaevskii equation and the solutions of the whitham modulation equations describing the resolution of the upstream and downstream discontinuities through dispersive shocks . </S>",
