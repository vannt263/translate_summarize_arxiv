    "the evolution of galaxy cluster abundance traces the massive end of the spectrum of initial density fluctuations and therefore is sensitive to cosmological parameters such as the ratio of the average matter density to the critical density @xmath12 , the normalization of the power spectrum of initial density fluctuations @xmath3 , and the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath4 , equal to the ratio of the pressure to the energy density of dark energy . here",
    ", @xmath13 is the hubble constant and @xmath14 is the average density in the universe .",
    "this sensitivity exists due to an exponential turnover at high masses in the mass function ( mf ) of clusters , which can be predicted from a well - established theoretical framework ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , only gravitational lensing , which remains observationally challenging , directly measures the total mass of clusters . in order to get masses for the large number of clusters needed to construct the mf , it is often necessary to use a more observationally accessible quantity , such as the temperature or luminosity of x - ray emitting intracluster gas , from which the mass can be determined via some physical model .",
    "relations between cluster mass and such a proxy typically require the gas to be in virial equilibrium ; however , many processes are known that can disrupt the gas , including cluster mergers ( @xcite , hereafter rs ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and agn jet - blown radio bubbles @xcite .",
    "there are many ongoing and planned surveys of clusters using the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite , which has the advantage of being effectively redshift - independent .",
    "the sz effect is proportional to the integral of the electron pressure along the line of sight and can be characterized by the comptonization parameter @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the electron number density , @xmath17 is the electron temperature , @xmath18 is the electron pressure , and @xmath19 is the distance along the line of sight .",
    "the actual sz flux , measured as a decrement or increment in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , depends on frequency and is subject to relativistic effects for high temperature plasmas ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "because we do not want to tie our results to any particular observational project , we use the frequency - independent comptonization parameter in the following study , as has been standard in the literature .",
    "also , we ignore any relativistic corrections as they are only relevant for the most massive clusters and because they modify @xmath20 in a complicated way that depends on frequency .    in general , sz observations will give an image of the sz effect or @xmath20 across the cluster .",
    "while specific values of @xmath20 , for example the central or maximum value for a cluster ( hereafter @xmath0 ) , are not expected to be a particularly robust proxy for the mass , the integrated comptonization parameter @xmath1 displays a tighter correlation with mass @xcite .",
    "this is defined as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the projected surface area of the cluster on the sky , @xmath23 is the solid angle , @xmath24 is the angular diameter distance to the cluster , and the integral is over the entire cluster on the sky . because the integrated comptonization parameter is a global quantity , proportional to @xmath25 or the thermal energy content of the electrons , it should be less sensitive to non - equilibrium processes , which tend to be more localized in cluster cores .",

    "as with x - ray proxies for mass , the regularity of an sz@xmath5 correlation relies on the fact that many clusters are energetically close to equilibrium .",
    "however , dynamically unrelaxed clusters should add scatter to this correlation .",
    "one mechanism known to disrupt the gas is cluster mergers , a direct consequence of hierarchical structure formation . how mergers affect the state of the gas will depend on the details of the individual mergers and their frequency , both of which depend on the cosmological model . to assess the utility of a mass proxy , such as the sz effect ,",
    "we need to quantify how mergers will affect the observed mf and consequently the estimation of cosmological parameters .    current cosmological simulations , which accurately trace the collapse of structure and thus the merger history of clusters , can not yet build the large samples of clusters at sufficient numerical resolution to constrain fundamental parameters and assess any potential bias due to mergers  though this approach is becoming viable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "40 to 60 snapshots were saved fairly regularly over the 14 gyr the mergers were followed . from the gas pressure distribution , the comptonization parameters can be calculated individually for each snapshot and combined to trace the evolution of @xmath1 and @xmath0 during the merger .",
    "simulated sz images for any orientation can be generated for each snapshot .",
    "as an example , figure  [ fig : yim ] shows @xmath52 pixel images from 2 snapshots of the @xmath53 , @xmath54 merger . for both of these images ,",
    "our line - of - sight is oriented at @xmath55 to the merger axis and rotated @xmath55 azimuthally from the merger plane . in this particular example , the clusters are seen just before and just after the first core crossing , which generally corresponds to the maximum transient enhancement of both @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "note that while the images look qualitatively similar , the scale of the image after core passage is twice that of the pre - core passage snapshot , suggesting that both @xmath1 and @xmath0 should get  boosted \" during a merger event .    to compute @xmath56 ,",
    "we simply add up the pressure in each computational cell weighted by the cell volume so that @xmath57 , where the sum is over all the cells in the 3d grid .",
    "we do not restrict the integration to the virial radius @xmath58 or @xmath59 as in other cases where @xmath1 has been modeled @xcite for several reasons .",
    "first , the initial conditions for the simulated clusters cut off the pressure and density profile at the virial radius , so these definitions are at least initially equivalent .",
    "also , during the merger there is no such well - defined radius as the gas is interacting violently .",
    "however , nearly all of the contribution to @xmath1 comes from gas inside the virial radius : 99.5% initially and 95% after the clusters have merged and equilibrated .    for each snapshot of each merger simulation ,",
    "values of @xmath0 are computed for 339 orientations of the merger relative to our line of sight . because the effects of the merger on the value of @xmath0 tend to vary the most near the merger axis , we more finely sampled the viewing angles in this direction .",
    "the orientations sampled with respect to the merger axis are uniformly spaced in @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the polar angle , such that @xmath62 .",
    "the sampling of the azimuthal angle @xmath63 is varied , to ensure relatively even spacing , as @xmath64 . to determine @xmath0 for each merger , snapshot , and orientation , values of @xmath20",
    "were computed by integrating along 16 lines of sight ( equation  ( [ eq : y ] ) ) , on a 4x4 grid , to form an sz image of the cluster as seen from that orientation .",
    "the grid was then recentered on the maximum value of @xmath20 and reduced in scale by a factor of 3.5 , and @xmath20 was calculated again .",
    "this procedure was repeated until the maximum value on the grid varied by less than 0.1% compared to the value from the previous iteration , and this @xmath20 is adopted as @xmath0 .      during each merger ,",
    "some gas is flung out to large radii and lost from the simulation due to the finite size of the computational grid and outflow boundary conditions at the grid edge .",
    "of course , once the gas is outside the simulation grid , it is permanently lost .",
    "noticeable amounts of gas do not leave the grid until after the first core passage .",
    "since we are mainly interested in the times when the merger boost is large , which occurs near the peak associated with first core passage , our results are not particularly affected by the lost gas . at late times , however , after the clusters have merged , @xmath1 remains below the expected value for a cluster with mass @xmath65 .",
    "since at these cluster masses @xmath66 and @xmath48 , we correct for the lost gas by taking @xmath67 ^ 2      y_{\\rm calc } \\ , , \\ ] ] and @xmath68^{1.3 }      y_{\\rm calc }      \\ , .\\ ] ] here , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the integrated and maximum sz parameters calculated by integration over the grid prior to this correction .",
    "the correction is small ; over the duration of the first peak in @xmath1 , which is much longer than the peak in @xmath0 , less than 5% of the gas has been lost from the grid .    in fact , some of the lost gas exits the grid near to or above escape velocity , assuming a collisionless ballistic trajectory , so correcting for its loss may seem inappropriate .",
    "the majority of the gas , except during the short period after the first core passage , effectively leaks out of the grid due to a lack of pressure support at the simulation boundary .",
    "this artificially lower pressure propagates inward , requiring the correction we apply ; otherwise , the boost will be slightly underestimated .",
    "after clusters have formed in cosmological numerical simulations , the gas fraction at the virial radius is generally 10% below the cosmic baryon fraction @xcite , perhaps indicating that up to @xmath715% of the gas has been ejected , given that 5% of the baryons are in stars .",
    "the simulations of we utilize can not accurately follow the merger to its true final state and so we can not address the question of true gas ejection from clusters after merger events .",
    "however , the initial simulated clusters are constructed to match observed clusters with realistic gas fractions , so if gas is in fact lost , that effect is intrinsically included by and the resultant boosts in @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "our conclusions are not drawn from any late time evolution in the simulations , nor do we investigate the true post - merger state of clusters .    additionally , we correct @xmath1 for the slight evolution at large radii in the relaxed , pre - merger profiles of the simulated clusters . because the integrated comptonization parameter is inversely proportional to a low power of cluster radius due to @xmath72 ,",
    "the outer parts of a cluster contribute significantly to its overall value , as compared to @xmath28 , which is proportional to @xmath73 .",
    "the lower pressure in the outer regions can affect @xmath1 because there is more volume at large radii , even though @xmath0 remains unaffected .",
    "we observe a slight drop in the pressure profile outside the central core over time before the individual clusters begin to interact , which is likely due to the artificial truncation of gas at the virial radius  gas at this boundary is not in hydrostatic equilibrium in the simulations and will flow outward , and the loss of pressure support will travel inward , readjusting the profile as the system tries to establish hydrostatic balance .",
    "while for the least massive cluster this effect is hardly noticeable , the magnitude of the effect increases with total cluster mass .",
    "fortunately , the effect on @xmath74 appears to be linear in time , so we correct the time evolution of @xmath1 such that @xmath1 is forced to be constant before the clusters begin to interact , normalized to @xmath75 .      in figure  [",
    "fig : yt ] , @xmath1 and @xmath0 are shown as a function of time for the merger simulations including the corrections described in ",
    "[ sec : massloss ] . for @xmath0",
    ", the plot is shown for a viewing orientation at 90@xmath76 to the merger axis and in the merger plane .",
    "the maximum boost for the head - on collision in @xmath0 is nearly a factor of 10 , while the boost in @xmath1 is always less than a factor of 2 , though the duration of the boost in @xmath1 is much longer than that for @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite report a maximum boost factor in @xmath0 of 20 in cosmological simulations re - simulated to include gas hydrodynamics , twice the amount of boosting we find , though their result could be due to an artificially high central temperature in their pre - merger clusters @xcite .",
    "however , it is more likely the enhanced boost is due to the natural inclusion of multiple mergers and constant accretion along filaments , which are not included in binary merger simulations .",
    "for example , a triple merger between 2 equal mass clusters and a third subcluster with a tenth of one of their masses should yield a boost factor of 20 , extrapolating our results to such a case .",
    "additional pressure due to bulk motions within the pre - merger clusters , producing stronger shocks , may also lead to a larger boost .",
    "globally , the temperature profile of the initial clusters in agrees well with those clusters assembled in cosmological simulations @xcite , so the precise origin of the discrepency is unclear .",
    "however , our boost factors are confirmed in a recent set of binary cluster mergers @xcite , in which @xcite find @xmath0 to be boosted by a factor of @xmath26 ( see their figure  7 ) .",
    "essentially , @xmath0 traces the densest parts of clusters , which are the cores .",
    "these remain reasonably intact until near the time of first core crossing , which makes the peak in @xmath0 relatively narrow . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath1 involves a sum of all the gas , so it begins to get boosted as soon as gas at large radii starts to interact , long before the cores approach , and the boost lasts longer , as gas in the outer regions needs more time to re - equilibrate .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath0 is qualitatively similar to that found by for the x - ray temperature and luminosity , quantities that are also dominated by the cores of clusters due to the fact that the x - ray emissivity depends on the square of the density .",
    "the plots of the evolution of @xmath1 already indicate that this parameter will not be strongly affected by mergers .",
    "first , the boosts in @xmath1 are smaller than in @xmath0 .",
    "second , the boosts are not large compared to the equilibrium effect of increasing the mass . assuming @xmath77",
    ", the boost factor @xmath78 needed to exceed the final equilibrium value of @xmath79 is @xmath80 . for equal mass mergers",
    ", this condition gives @xmath81 , and from figure  [ fig : yt ] it is clear the boost factor is always @xmath82 . if @xmath1 is used as a proxy to determine the mass of a cluster , the resulting value during the merger will nearly always lie between the individual initial masses of the subclusters and the final total mass . in a certain sense , this only affects the definition of when the cluster has merged , and the applicable mass , and does not represent a real bias . we find that other mass ratios can boost @xmath1 beyond the final equilibrium value , but only by factors slightly larger than unity .",
    "structure formation and evolution are most easily traced through the mass function ( mf ) of dark matter halos , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 gives the number of halos per unit comoving volume with masses in the range @xmath85 .",
    "currently , the mf for a given cosmology at a given redshift can be found most accurately from numerical n - body simulations @xcite . while accessing the results of these simulations",
    "has become more feasible ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a semi - analytic approach to obtaining the mf proves more practical , especially since we are concerned with the relative effect of merger boosts on the underlying mf and not the precise nature of the mf itself .",
    "we follow the ps formalism , which agrees with the mf found in numerical simulations , especially at higher masses @xcite ; specifically , we use extended press - schechter theory as developed in @xcite and @xcite and applied in . though the ps formalism fails to reproduce the mf found in numerical simulations at very high redshifts and low cluster masses ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is more than sufficient over the redshifts ( @xmath86 ) and masses ( @xmath87 ) of interest here .",
    "@xcite give the mf at some redshift @xmath8 as @xmath88 dm\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the current rms density fluctuation within a sphere of mean mass @xmath5 , and @xmath90 is the critical linear overdensity required for a region to collapse at redshift @xmath8 .",
    "the derivation of this expression assumes that halos grow from gaussian density fluctuations that have larger amplitudes on smaller scales .",
    "structure then forms hierarchically , with small halos collapsing first and merging to form larger halos . in this scenario ,",
    "the highest mass halos , observed as clusters of galaxies , form most recently and should be most affected by merger processes at the present day .    from this extended ps formalism ,",
    "we follow the procedure outlined in   3 of , in which a  merger tree \" is generated for a present day cluster .",
    "the merger tree traces the merger and accretion history of a cluster of mass @xmath5 back in time . for each time step ,",
    "a progenitor cluster of mass @xmath91 is chosen from a probability distribution ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation  ( 2.25 ) ) , and since we only consider binary mergers , the mass of the other progenitor cluster is given by @xmath92 .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath93 and @xmath94 for the larger and smaller masses of the subclusters in each binary merger . in   3.1 discusses the disadvantages of dealing solely with binary mergers ; however , our set of simulated mergers does not address more complex mergers , so we have no good way to derive a boost for them .",
    "also , boosts are most dramatic for near equal mass mergers , and in such cases additional merger participants will likely be much less massive and have a negligible effect on the resultant boosts . however , one result of ignoring multiple mergers is that the merger tree - derived mf tends to overestimate the analytic ps mf for @xmath95 .",
    "the progenitor cluster with mass @xmath96 is not taken from the ps distribution and is generally overestimated , so that the high mass end of the mf is overestimated at the expense of the very low mass end .",
    "since we concern ourselves with the highest mass clusters , our resulting mfs will lie slightly above the analytic prediction , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : bnbyf ] , which we must take into account when fitting mfs in   [ sec : fityfs ] .",
    "a large number of merger trees was created with a broad span of initial cluster masses , and the distribution of the initial masses was weighted so as to give the present day mass function . from ensembles of merger trees for the cosmologies of interest , we can find the mf at any redshift , and at any redshift we have each cluster s merger history , which can be used to determine the merger boost in some observable  in our case @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "merger trees are a simple and computationally cheap way to simulate structure formation for a particular world model .",
    "but they are limited in that they only specify progenitor cluster masses and discrete time intervals during which the mergers occur .",
    "all the dynamics and other details of a merger , however , are absent from eps - derived merger trees .",
    "the information needed to connect the trees to our merger simulations is the masses of the clusters , the impact parameter @xmath97 of the encounter , and the time of first core passage , which we designate as the time of the merger , @xmath98 , in the merger trees .",
    "while the masses are provided by the merger trees , an appropriate @xmath97 must be selected for each merger in the trees .",
    "we follow the method in   6 of , where a value for the spin parameter is chosen from a maxwell - boltzmann - like distribution , which represents the observed distribution from numerical simulations @xcite , allowing @xmath97 to be derived from the chosen spin parameter @xcite .",
    "to determine the precise value of @xmath98 , we simply select a random time within the small discrete time step used in the merger trees , and take that time to be the instant of first core passage , since the merger could have occurred at any point within that time .      as discussed in , the effect of a merger boost on a cluster whose history is characterized by a merger tree can be determined from a histogram which gives the magnitude of the boost as a function of time .",
    "since the merger trees give a statistical description of the history of cluster mergers , it is sufficient to determine the distribution histogram of boosts versus the observed time @xmath99 .",
    "the form of the histogram reduces the details contained in the curves in figure  [ fig : yt ] to a simpler , one - to - one function that can be fit by the merger parameters @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath97 . in the fits",

    "the procedure for @xmath0 is slightly more complicated due to the orientation - dependence of the central comptonization parameter .",
    "the evolution of the maximum value of @xmath20 as a function of viewing angle varies more dramatically near the merger axis than perpendicular to it .",
    "as noted in   [ sec : yt ] , for each merger simulation , the evolution of @xmath0 with time was calculated for 339 orientations , sampling more finely around the merger axis . because @xmath0 really traces the cluster cores , the peaks in the curves are larger and have shorter durations . as a result",
    ", we found that simple interpolation did not sufficiently sample the peaks , so we use a superposition of gaussians to fit the shape of the boost as a function of time .",
    "the merger trees contain no information about the orientation of the cluster mergers , and we assume an isotropic distribution relative to our line - of - sight . for our grid of 339 viewing angles , the probability of any one orientation is determined by the solid angle of that grid cell .",
    "we weight each orientation by this solid angle divided by @xmath105 .",
    "all 339 @xmath106 curves , weighted by their probability of being observed , are used to construct a histogram like those described in   [ sec : yinthist ] .",
    "the histograms for the @xmath104 runs are shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : histy ] . since these histograms include the distribution of merger boosts for all orientations of the line of sight , the boosts need to be normalized to the pre - boost value of @xmath0 for some fixed orientation .",
    "the boosts in the right panel of figure  [ fig : histy ] were taken relative to the pre - boost @xmath0 as observed 90@xmath76 to the merger axis and in the merger plane .",
    "note that this is the same orientation assumed in the right panels of figure  [ fig : yt ] .    because the @xmath0 histograms include the results from many different orientations , the high boost ends of the histograms decline more slowly with time than for @xmath1 or @xmath28 or @xmath29 . a different function",

    "we found that the time sampling for the @xmath110 simulation run was too sparse around the boost to strongly constrain the shape of the @xmath0 histogram , so we did not use this run in our fits .      with the fitted forms for the histograms for the strength of a boost versus time as a function of the masses of the merging subclusters @xmath94 and @xmath93 and the impact parameter @xmath97 , the boosted values of @xmath1 or @xmath0",
    "can easily be found for clusters from their past merger histories given by the merger trees .",
    "for any redshift or observed time , @xmath99 , we search back through a cluster s merger tree and for every merger event , we find the boosted value of @xmath1 or @xmath0 for that merger .",
    "if the boosted @xmath1 or @xmath0 exceeds the value given by our equilibrium equations  ( [ eq : yintdef ] ) and ( [ eq : ymaxdef ] ) for the mass of the cluster at @xmath99 , then we assign the boosted value to that cluster s observed @xmath1 or @xmath0 ; otherwise it acquires its equilibrium value .",
    "boosted values less than those given by the equilibrium equations are not allowed because the analytic fits from which boost factors are derived poorly describe the histograms , such as those shown in figure  [ fig : histy ] , for negative and small positive boosts . while the discrepency between the simulation - based histograms and the analytic fits for small boosts leads to an underestimate of the number of these clusters ,",
    "we are primarily concerned with the more dramatic effects caused by large boosts , which are well - described by the fits .",
    "once clusters observed at some redshift are assigned values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 based on each cluster s merger history , we can evaluate the robustness of the @xmath111 and @xmath0@xmath5 relations .",
    "the top panels of figures  [ fig : yiscat ] and [ fig : ymscat ] show @xmath1 and @xmath0 versus mass for clusters in our merger trees at @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "most clusters have nearly unboosted values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , while the number of clusters that deviate from either sz@xmath5 relation drops roughly exponentially with the strength of the boost .",
    "we find that @xmath112 of clusters are boosted in @xmath0 by @xmath113 and in @xmath1 by @xmath114 .",
    "note that the scatter in figures  [ fig : yiscat ] and [ fig : ymscat ] is due entirely to merger boosts and does not include observational error or scatter related to other physics .",
    "as expected , many clusters are found to have significantly boosted values of @xmath0 , which overestimate the actual masses .",
    "however , there are almost no  boosts \" to @xmath1 in figure  [ fig : yiscat ] . instead , we see clusters scattered _ below _ the @xmath1@xmath5 relation , as is also seen , though to a lesser extent , in figure  [ fig : ymscat ] .",
    "clusters that fall below the @xmath1@xmath5 relation were  observed \" after a merger ( after the peak of the boost ) , but before virialization .",
    "it should be noted that , according to   [ sec : applymt ] , a boost is only applied if it gives a @xmath1 or @xmath0 greater than its equilibrium value _ before _ the merger , while in figures  [ fig : yiscat ] and [ fig : ymscat ] the mass is taken to be the final , or merged , mass of the clusters .",
    "so , though clusters can never fall below their pre - merger equilibrium relation in our formulation , a boosted cluster may fall below its post - merger value .",
    "the scatter below the @xmath0@xmath5 relation is less pronounced due to the shorter period when the sz effect is below the eventual equilibrium value ( see figure  [ fig : yt ] ) .",
    "this feature is a general characteristic of observing a recent post - merger cluster and will be difficult to identify as such in an actual survey , and will likely affect the normalization of either sz@xmath5 relation .    in order to quantify the effect of mergers on the sz versus mass relations , we fit power - law functions of the form @xmath115 or @xmath116 to all of the clusters with @xmath117 or @xmath118 .",
    "we estimate the scatter with respect to the best fit , @xmath119 , and also the scatter and offset with respect to the actual equilibrium relations for the sz effect ( equations  ( [ eq : yintdef ] ) and ( [ eq : ymaxdef ] ) ) , @xmath120 .",

    "clusters are boosted somewhat uniformly in @xmath1 and @xmath0 across masses , which tends to change the normalization of the fit , @xmath22 , and only to a lesser extent the slope , @xmath124 .",
    "the inclusion of merger boosts , in the case of @xmath0 , could either flatten or steepen the slope .",
    "the local mass function is flatter at the low - mass end , so low - mass clusters experience more high - mass - ratio mergers overall than high - mass clusters , thus flattening the @xmath0@xmath5 relation .",
    "however , when both minor and major mergers are considered , at any given time the high - mass clusters are undergoing more merger events ( see the relative change in yf over time for low- and high - mass clusters in figure  [ fig : bnbyf ] ) .",
    "thus , at any given time a higher - mass cluster has a greater probability of finding itself in the midst of a merger of some type .",
    "if the mass function is oversampled at the high - mass end , this effect tends to steepen the @xmath0@xmath5 relation .",
    "because our cluster sample has a uniform distribution in log mass , we oversample the high - mass end relative to the low - mass end .",

    "the normalization increases by @xmath126 .",
    "the offsets to @xmath0 are due as much to clusters with small boost factors as to the rarer cases with very large boosts .",
    "note that these clusters tend to be undergoing weaker mergers , which may be hard to detect .",
    "thus , it may be difficult to expunge these clusters from sz surveys , and the systematic shift in the @xmath0 versus mass relation may bias cluster samples .",
    "the merger - induced scatter to the fit , @xmath119 , is @xmath127 for the @xmath1@xmath5 relation and 25 - 30% for the @xmath0@xmath5 relation , and is nearly independent of the cosmological world model and redshift .",
    "the scatter relative to the equilibrium relations , @xmath120 , increases with redshift since the merger rate is higher in the past , whereas the addition of boosted clusters adjusts the normalization @xmath22 to minimize @xmath119 , so the scatter remains about constant between redshifts .",
    "also , because there are fewer clusters that show boosts in @xmath1 , the scatter @xmath119 is dominated by deviations of the equilibrium relation from a power - law form , which explains why @xmath120 tends to be slightly smaller than @xmath119 for @xmath1 .",

    "the large number of galaxy clusters expected from upcoming sz surveys , both locally and at potentially high redshifts , heightens the prospects that clusters could play a decisive role in the era of precision cosmology , especially if the robustness of @xmath1 as a proxy for mass is confirmed in real cluster samples .",
