    "the surface - brightness profiles of spheroidal and disk components of galaxies are well described by the @xcite law @xmath5\\right\\ } , \\label{eq : ser}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the effective radius , @xmath0 is the index , @xmath7 is the surface brightness at the effective radius and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath0 is high the central profile is steep and the outer profile is shallow , while when @xmath0 is low the central profile is shallow and the outer profile is steep . recently @xcite has envisaged that these profiles arise naturally in the standard cosmological model with initial density fluctuations represented by a gaussian random field ( grf ) .",
    "the underlying idea is that central concentrations of stars and extended envelopes are formed by the late infall and accretion of substructures .",
    "therefore , if the fluctuation field is dominated by long - wavelength modes the formation of the galaxy , due to the absence of significant substructures , is mainly determined by a coherent collapse , and the final profile will be shallow in the center and steep in the outskirts ( an extreme case is the exponential profile @xmath9 , which is typical for disks ) . if the fluctuation field is dominated by short - wavelength modes there is substantial late infall of substructures and the final profile will be steeply rising toward the center and gently declining in the outskirts ( as observed , for instance , in massive elliptical galaxies with @xmath10 ) .",
    "in this letter we explore quantitatively cen s proposal with numerical experiments in which we follow the dissipationless collapse of cold distributions of particles whose initial conditions are determined by grfs with different power spectra .",
    "numerical simulations of dissipationless collapse have been run by several authors @xcite .",
    "a general finding is that the end - products have surface - density profiles well fitted by the law ( equation  [ eq : ser ] ) .",
    "remarkably , this result is not specific to newtonian gravity , as it is also found in studies of dissipationless collapses in modified gravity theories @xcite . in newtonian gravity",
    "the final index is typically close to @xmath11 ( @xcite , hereafter ) , the value corresponding to the @xcite profile .",
    "though there are some indications that the final value of @xmath0 can depend on the initial conditions @xcite , so far there is no clear evidence of a dependence of @xmath0 on the properties of the initial fluctuations .",
    "since the seminal work of @xcite it was realized that the clumpiness of the initial conditions is an important factor in determining the nature of the collapse end - product .",
    "clumpy initial conditions were considered in several investigations @xcite , but in these works the inhomogeneities of the initial phase - space distribution were not systematically classified in terms of fluctuation power spectrum .",
    "an exception is ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) , who set up the initial conditions self - consistently from a grf and explored different power spectra ( see also @xcite and @xcite , section 4.10.3 ) .    here",
    "we present high - resolution @xmath1-body simulations aimed at isolating the effect of the spectrum of the inhomogeneities of the initial conditions on the final density profiles of cold dissipationless collapses .",
    "we present evidence that the index of the collapse end - product correlates with the slope of the fluctuation power spectrum of the initial conditions .",

    "the corresponding end - products ( central column of panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] ) tend to be more extended when the initial conditions are more homogeneous ( upper plots ) and more compact when the initial conditions are clumpier ( lower plots ) . the final half - mass radius @xmath79 ranges from @xmath86 when @xmath83 down to @xmath87 when @xmath85 ( see table  [ tab : par ] and fig .  [ fig : corr]a ) .",
    "the end - products are typically triaxial with @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",

    "@xmath95 is shorter than the simulation time - span @xmath96 ( see rightmost axes in fig .  [",

    "we quantify this finding by comparing the final distributions with the law ( equation  [ eq : ser ] ) . under the assumption of spherical symmetry and position - independent mass - to - light ratio ,",

    "[ fig : all ] ) . in simulation p0 ( with smooth initial conditions )",
    "we perform the fit over the smaller radial range @xmath107 , because the profile has a power - law tail at large radii ( see top - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] ) , which is reminiscent of the core - halo structure , a well - known feature of collapses starting from homogeneous initial conditions @xcite . fig .",
    "[ fig : corr]c shows that the best - fitting index @xmath0 increases for increasing @xmath13 : clumpier initial conditions lead to higher values of @xmath0 .",
    "the results of our simulations confirm the conjecture of @xcite : the density profile of dissipationless collapse is steeper in the center and shallower in the outer parts if the fluctuation power spectrum of the initial conditions is dominated by short - wavelength modes .",
    "vice versa , power spectra dominated by long - wavelength fluctuations lead to density profiles that are shallow in the center and steep in the outskirts .",
    "the end - products of our simulations have density distributions well represented by the deprojected law with index in the range @xmath108 . for increasing spectral index @xmath13 the best - fitting index @xmath0 increases , the half - mass radius @xmath79 decreases , and the systems tend to move from almost prolate to almost oblate intrinsic shape .    of course",
    ", the exact values of the measured quantities are expected to depend on the details of the initial conditions : for instance , while here we find @xmath109 for the end - product of simulation p0 ( with smooth initial @xmath110 density profile ) , it is well known that the end - product of a cold collapse with smooth initial @xcite density distribution is extremely well fitted by the @xcite @xmath11 profile ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the above range @xmath105 must not be taken at face value . however , it is interesting to notice that , based on the results of the present work and of previous studies , it appears hard to get @xmath111 with purely dissipationless processes , consistent with the expectation that the formation of @xmath4 systems ( typically disks ) requires dissipative processes .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results with those of previous similar investigations .",
    "a very interesting work is the paper of , who attempted a systematic study of the effect of grf power spectrum on the structure of virialized systems .",
    "though the initial conditions of simulations , which were meant to represent conditions before turn - around , are different from ours in many respects , based on the results of the present work we should expect that the final density profiles of depend on the initial fluctuation power spectrum . in fact , the conclusion of is that the final profiles do not depend significantly on the power - spectrum slope : however , when compared to today s standard , the resolution of the simulations of is rather poor ( @xmath112 particles ) , so it is likely that detailed differences in the density profiles were obscured by numerical noise .",
    "a set - up in a sense more similar to ours was that of , who did not included fluctuations in their initial conditions , but considered the dissipationless collapse of smooth triaxial particle distribution with the same initial density field as our background distribution ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "our simulation p0 ( with no fluctuation ; @xmath64 ) is therefore very similar to those of with virial ratio @xmath114 and actually , consistent , we find a prolate final system with axis ratios @xmath115 .",
    "however , while we find best - fitting index @xmath109 , report that their final distributions are well fitted by @xmath11 . again , this is likely a matter of resolution : , with 5000 particles , can follow the profile down to @xmath116 , where the difference between the @xmath117 and @xmath11 profiles is hard to detect , while in this work we have been able to fit the profiles down to @xmath118 .",
    "independent support to cen s model and to our results comes from numerical studies of dissipationless galaxy mergers .",
    "a galaxy growing in a region of the universe dominated by fluctuations on small scales is expected to form by several mergers of smaller subunits .",
    "the finding that the best - fitting index @xmath0 increases for increasing fluctuation power - spectrum index @xmath13 is therefore consistent with the results of numerical simulations showing that dissipationless mergers make the index increase @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the dissipationless accretion of small satellites is believed to be the most promising mechanism to form high-@xmath0 systems @xcite .",
    "however , dissipative processes can also contribute to raise @xmath0 , as found for instance in simulations of mergers between gas - rich disk galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this work we have provided quantitative support to the idea that the origin of the law is related to the fluctuation power spectrum in the initial conditions of galaxy formation .",
    "still , our results are based on toy models that neglect all the complexities of proper galaxy formation theories . in the future",
    "it will be interesting to explore this idea more realistically by using cosmological simulations with distinct baryonic and dark matter components , and including the all - important dissipative processes .",
