    "it is well known that the addition of a term to the conventional yang - mills gauge field action in @xmath1 dimensions leads to a massive transverse gauge mode , with mass equal to the coupling constant , @xmath2 @xcite . in a nonabelian theory , consistency of the quantum theory under large gauge transformations",
    "requires that the dimensionless ratio @xmath3 be quantized as an integer , where @xmath4 is the gauge coupling .",
    "this is most easily understood as a field theoretical analogue of dirac s monopole quantization condition which requires @xmath5 to be gauge invariant @xcite .",
    "pisarski and rao have shown @xcite that in a 1-loop perturbative analysis of topologically massive @xmath6 chern - simons - yang - mills gauge theory , the bare ratio @xmath7 receives a finite renormalization shift equal to the integer @xmath8 .",
    "it has since been shown that there is no further correction at two loops @xcite , and there exist general arguments that this should be true to all orders @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , one can also generate a gauge field mass by the conventional higgs mechanism , in a vacuum in which the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken . in this letter",
    "we consider the perturbative fate of the integer quantization condition on the coupling in the broken phase of a spontaneously broken nonabelian topologically massive theory .",
    "we show that if there is still a nonabelian symmetry present in the broken phase , then the one - loop renormalized ratio @xmath9_{\\rm ren}$ ] is shifted from its bare value by an integer .",
    "the abelian spontaneously broken theory was investigated in @xcite , where it was shown that in the broken vacuum @xmath7 receives a finite renormalization shift which is a complicated function of the various mass scales : the mass @xmath2 , the gauge coupling @xmath4 , and the symmetry breaking mass scale .",
    "a similar situation exists for a completely broken nonabelian theory @xcite .",
    "however , here there is no apparent contradiction with the quantization condition since there is no residual nonabelian symmetry in the broken vacuum . to probe this question more deeply , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite introduced an ingenious model in which a nonabelian topologically massive theory is partially broken , leaving a nonabelian gauge symmetry in the broken phase .",
    "one s immediate expectation is that once again the renormalized ratio @xmath10_{\\rm ren}$ ] should be quantized , but with an integer renormalization shift characteristic of the smaller unbroken residual gauge symmetry .",
    "we have reconsidered this model both in a detailed canonical treatment and , as reported in this letter , in a direct perturbative analysis .",
    "we disagree with the result reported in ref .",
    "we find that the integer quantization condition * is * indeed preserved to one loop .",
    "the mechanism by which this quantization arises in a perturbative analysis is considerably more involved than the pisarski and rao case @xcite where there is no symmetry breaking .",
    "the cancellations required to produce the integer shift can be viewed as new ` topological ward identities ' for the spontaneously broken theory , generalizing the ` topological ward identity ' found in @xcite .    for simplicity",
    ", we consider an @xmath11 topologically massive gauge theory , coupled to a triplet of charged scalar fields with a potential possessing a vacuum in which the @xmath11 symmetry is spontaneously broken to @xmath12 .",
    "we later show that our result applies also to the case of @xmath6 broken to @xmath13 , for @xmath14 .",

    "the most direct way @xcite to derive the broken propagators ( [ broken ] ) is to invert the self - energy in ( [ quadratic ] ) , but a more physical approach is to note that the two masses @xmath32 correspond precisely to the two characteristic frequencies @xmath33 of a planar quantum mechanical system in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field ( corresponding to the interaction ) and a harmonic potential ( corresponding to the higgs potential ) @xcite .",
    "the 3-gluon vertex differs from the standard qcd vertex by the inclusion of a parity - odd contribution , giving the combined vertex : v_^abc(p , q , r)=-i g f^abc[vertex ] in addition there are the conventional vertices of spontaneously broken gauge theory .",

    "there are three types of contribution to the computation of @xmath38 , as shown in fig .",
    "the first contribution , corresponding to the diagram in fig .",
    "1(a ) , arises from the external unbroken gluons coupling to internal unbroken gluons , and so is exactly the same as that computed by pisarski and rao - so we find _ odd^fig . 1(a)(p^2)= 2 g^2 [ graph1a ] where the overall factor of @xmath39 in front corresponds to the fact that this is essentially an @xmath12 computation . at @xmath40",
    "this reduces to _ odd^fig .",
    "1(a ) ( 0 ) = 2 g^2 ( 23 ) = 2 [ graph1azero ]    the second contribution to @xmath38 comes from the diagram in fig.1(b ) in which the external unbroken gluons couple to internal broken gluons , whose propagator is now of the form ( [ broken ] ) , and so the pisarski - rao computation must be modified .",
    "a lengthy , but straightforward computation , leads to the expression _",
    "1(b)(p^2)&= & 12g^2 \\ { 6m^2.&&.-m^2(((p+k)^2+m_d^2)/(p+k)^2+(k^2+m_d^2)/k^2).&&.-(6k^2 + 4p^2 + 6pk ) ( k^2+m_d^2)((p+k)^2+m_d^2)/(k^2(p+k)^2).&&.+(4p^2 + 4pk+8k^2)(k^2+m_d^2)/k^2.&&.+(8p^2 + 12pk+8k^2)((p+k)^2+m_d^2)/(p+k)^2 } [ graph1b ] where ( k^2+m_+^2)(k^2+m_-^2)((p+k)^2+m_+^2)((p+k)^2+m_-^2 ) at @xmath40 this reduces to _ odd^fig .",
    "1(b)(0)&= & 13g^2 & = & g^2 12(m_++m_- ) [ graph1bzero ] expressions for this diagram fig .",
    "1(b ) ( at @xmath40 ) have been published previously in @xcite .",
    "however these two previous expressions disagree with one another , as well as with our result ( [ graph1bzero ] ) .",
    "there is however , a check that when @xmath41 is set to zero inside the integral appearing in the expression ( [ graph1b ] ) ( i.e. no symmetry breaking ) , this should reduce ( apart from the overall group theoretical factor of 2 ) to the pisarski - rao expression in ( [ graph1a ] ) for _ all _ @xmath42 .",
    "this is true of our expression ( [ graph1b ] ) , but it is not true if the coefficients are modified to agree with the expressions in either @xcite or @xcite . it is a remarkably unfortunate coincidence of numerology that if one tries this @xmath43 reduction for the diagram evaluated at @xmath40 , then all three expressions reproduce the @xmath44 factor in the pisarski and rao result ( [ graph1azero ] ) , _ after _ the @xmath45 integration has been performed .",
    "the third contribution to @xmath38 comes from the diagram in fig .",
    "1(c ) in which the external unbroken gluons couple to an internal broken gluon and to the internal unphysical scalar fields @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "this diagram contributes _",
    "1(c)(p^2)= g^2 m_d^2 [ graph1c ] which reduces at @xmath40 to _ odd^fig .",
    "1(c)(0)= g^2 16(m_++m_- ) [ graph1czero ]      to compute @xmath37 we need to compute the ghost self - energy , which has two contributions , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "the contribution of fig 2(a ) corresponds to an internal unbroken gluon , and so this is once again identical to the pisarski - rao computation .",
    "this yields ^fig .",
    "2(a)(p^2)= -2 g^2 [ graph2a ] at @xmath40 this reduces to ^fig .",
    "2(a)(0)= -2 g^2",
    "16 m [ graph2azero ] the second contribution comes from fig .",
    "2(b ) in which the internal gluon propagator is of the broken form ( [ broken ] ) , giving ^fig .",
    "2(b)(p^2)= -g^2 [ graph2b ] which reduces at @xmath40 to ^fig .",
    "2(b)(0)= -g^2 13(m_++m_- ) [ graph2bzero ] thus the renormalization factor @xmath36 is given by = 1- g^2 [ zedtilde ]    we are now able to compute the renormalized ratio @xmath50 appearing in ( [ ren ] ) : q_ren&= & 4mg^2 \\ { 1+g^2}&=&4mg^2 \\ { 1 + 2 g^24 m } & = & q_bare + 2 [ su3answer ] this shift by 2 corresponds precisely to the pisarski - rao shift for the residual @xmath12 symmetry in the broken vacuum . for an @xmath6 theory spontaneously broken to @xmath51 , with @xmath52 , this computation goes through almost entirely unchanged .",
    "for example , for @xmath6 broken to @xmath13 , the ` additional diagrams ' computed in ( [ graph1b],[graph1c],[graph2b ] ) are completely unchanged except for the values of @xmath32 .",
    "however , these cancel in the end and the @xmath53 generalization of the result ( [ su3answer ] ) is q_ren&= & 4mg^2 \\ { 1+g^2}&=&q_bare + ( n-1 ) [ sunanswer ]    to conclude , we comment that this result fills a gap in our previous understanding of the interplay between gauge invariance and the spontaneous breaking of parity .",
    "the general picture in the abelian theories is well understood - in the broken phase there is a radiative correction to the odd part of the photon propagator @xcite , but this should be understood not as a renormalization of the topological mass , but as due to the appearance of gauge invariant terms in the effective action which reduce to a chern - simons - like term when the scalar field takes its vacuum expectation value @xcite .",
    "this then extends the coleman - hill theorem @xcite , concerning the absence of corrections to the topological mass in certain abelian theories , to include the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "presumably a similar mechanism operates in the completely broken nonabelian theories @xcite , although this has not yet been demonstrated explicitly .",
    "when a nonabelian symmetry is only partially broken , leaving a residual nonabelian symmetry in the broken vacuum , this mechanism no longer works - there is no obvious way to construct gauge invariant terms in the effective action which could reduce to the nonabelian chern - simons term when the scalar fields take their vacuum expectation value .",
    "however , the result described here implies that no such extra terms are required .",
    "our result should also be relevant for the nonabelian generalizations of the abelian pure chern - simons - matter theories considered in ref .",
