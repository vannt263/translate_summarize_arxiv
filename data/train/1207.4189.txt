    "many schemes for classifying galaxies have been presented over the years , focusing on somewhat ephemeral properties such as morphology and color .",
    "alternatively , one may consider three fundamental physical parameters : mass @xmath2 , energy @xmath3 , and angular momentum @xmath4 .",
    "qualitatively , these are related to the amount of material in a galaxy , to the linear size , and to the rotation velocity .",
    "an important advantage of these parameters is that they may be related back to the earlier states of galaxies without having to unravel all of the messy intervening details such as baryonic dissipation , star formation , and morphological transformation . as an example",
    ", the simple assumption that @xmath4 is approximately conserved during the collapse of gas within hierarchically - forming dark matter halos naturally explains the observed basic scaling relations of disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "here `` conserved '' means that the initial @xmath5 is retained at a factor of @xmath1  2 level , unlike @xmath3 , which can be readily lost by factors of @xmath1  10 through dissipative collapse and radiation .",
    "note that the `` weak '' conservation of _ total _",
    "@xmath4 is less restrictive and more plausible than the `` strong '' conservation of the _ internal _ distribution of @xmath4 with radius , which could be readily altered by secular processes within disks while still preserving total @xmath4 ( e.g. , ; see @xcite and for further discussion ) .    in this vein , ( * ?",
    "* hereafter f83 ) introduced a general diagram of  versus stellar mass , where @xmath6 is the stellar specific angular momentum .",
    "this diagram has the important advantages that it deals with conservable physical quantities , and that the axes represent independent variables .",
    "the  axis embodies a _ mass _ scale , while the  axis represents a _ length _ scale times a _ rotation - velocity _ scale . on the contrary ,",
    "the standard relations between  and circular velocity @xmath7 ( e.g. , ) involve correlated variables , since @xmath7 may be directly connected to .",
    "another related parameter is the _ spin _ (",
    "@xmath8 ) , which is useful for characterizing dark matter halo rotation , and which we will discuss later in this paper .    the simple   diagram is still charged with useful information for understanding galaxies , and to orient the remainder of our discussion , we begin by reproducing the original version from f83 here in figure  [ fig : jmm00 ] .",
    "the only change is to rescale the data for a hubble constant of @xmath9 rather than @xmath10 .",
    "these data were for late - type spirals ( sb and sc ) based on extended optical rotation curves , and for elliptical galaxies based on observations from their inner half - light radii , as feasible in that era .",
    "the first key feature to note from figure  [ fig : jmm00 ] is that the spirals follow a fairly tight scaling relation of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 ( see also @xcite ) , which is a phenomenology that is now understood to provide a remarkable link between visible galaxies and their invisible dark matter halos .",
    "f83 provided a simple theoretical framework in which the gaseous baryons of galaxies are initially mixed with the dark matter and share in the same @xmath0 .",
    "the baryons then cool and decouple from the dark matter , collapsing into star - forming disks .",
    "if the baryonic @xmath0 is approximately conserved in this process , both the _ zeropoint _ and the _ slope _ of the observed spiral - galaxy   relation are reproduced .",
    "the formation of disk galaxies can thus be explained at a basic level through this long - standing picture of ( weak ) @xmath0 conservation . to provide further understanding , hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation",
    "have been pursued for decades , with the ",
    "observational diagram from f83 as a key benchmark for theory . attaining",
    "that benchmark has turned out to be a major challenge , with early studies finding catastrophic @xmath0 loss ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this angular momentum `` catastrophe '' can be attributed partially to numerical limitations , and partially to uncertainties in modeling baryonic processes such as feedback following star formation , as reviewed by @xcite . over the years , the simulations have improved and can now come close to reproducing the   observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although much work still remains in understanding both the numerics and the physics .",
    "besides the angular momentum benchmark from f83 which has become a standard ingredient in modeling the formation of disk galaxies , there is another aspect of the original ",
    "diagram that has received relatively little attention : the inclusion of elliptical galaxies along with the spirals .",
    "the diagram thereby provides a fundamental diagnostic of scaling relations for _ all _ galaxies , which is important because there is still not a full explanation for such a basic property as the @xcite sequence of galaxy morphologies .",
    "star formation considerations aside , there is an obvious _ dynamical _ distinction between galaxy disks and spheroids , which are characterized by cold , ordered rotation versus random motions with fairly low net rotation , respectively .",
    "differences in the conservation and distribution of @xmath0 may very well be pivotal to explaining these differences and to governing the fates of galaxies .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : jmm00 ] , f83 found that ellipticals followed a ",
    "trend roughly parallel to the spirals , but lower by a factor of @xmath1  6 , and with more apparent scatter ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "there are several potential explanations for such a difference between spirals and ellipticals , but the most plausible one is traced to a violent , clumpy genesis for spheroids .",
    "for example , mergers could naturally redistribute angular momentum from the central regions of a galaxy to its outer parts by dynamical friction ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , @xmath0 should be basically conserved but inconveniently locked up in unobservable components such as the dark halo and the faint outer stars .    with this theoretical sketch in hand ,",
    "the  disparity between spirals and ellipticals has received little further attention over the years .",
    "however , the scenario of angular momentum redistribution has not yet been directly tested by observations  a situation that may now finally be remedied via the advent of new techniques for optical spectroscopy in galaxy halos ( with preliminary results along these lines reported in @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we re - open various questions about angular momentum in all types of bright galaxies , following and extending the treatment of f83 .",
    "are the   slopes , zeropoints , and scatter in figure  [ fig : jmm00 ] supported upon re - examination ?",
    "does the `` missing ''  in ellipticals emerge in large - radius data ? can the  variations be associated with the natural dispersion in spin expected for standard dark matter halos , or is it necessary to invoke additional baryonic @xmath0 evolution ?",
    "f83 also proposed that the hubble sequence may be understood as a systematic variation in  at a fixed   ( or equivalently , variation in  at fixed ) , but could not test this idea owing to the lack of adequate data for the crucial , intermediate cases of sa and s0 galaxies . here",
    "we will pursue this theme , and advance a framework where every galaxy can be considered basically as a linear combination of a disk and a bulge , with each of these components following a characteristic   scaling relation . in this idealized model ,",
    "the   parameter space maps uniquely to a space of  and bulge fraction @xmath13 .",
    "figure  [ fig : schem1 ] provides a schematic overview of this framework , showing decompositions of the hubble sequence in   parameter space .",
    "one of our goals in this paper will be to include observational results for sa and s0 galaxies in this diagram for the first time , to see if such systems fill in the gap ( if any ) between earlier and later types , and if bulges and disks are homologous enough to explain the ",
    "trends as primarily reflecting a @xmath13 sequence .",
    "the   diagram does not simply provide a basic _ description _ of galaxies and their subcomponents , but also permits a novel approach to modeling the _ evolution _ of galaxies which is complementary to numerical simulations . as mentioned previously",
    ", there are simple models for the formation of disk galaxies that relate their  and  values to the initial conditions of their host halos .",
    "more generally , _ any _ stage in the evolution of a galaxy will involve a vector of change in the @xmath0-@xmath2 diagram that is not arbitrary , since in real physical processes , changes in @xmath0 and @xmath2 will be linked in characteristic ways . therefore the empirical offsets between the ",
    "sequences of different galaxy types , and of their subcomponents including bulges , disks , and dark matter halos , can reveal the evolutionary connections among them .",
    "we set out to explore the preceding questions and issues as follows . in section  [ sec : gen ] we present a methodology for careful estimation of  in various types of galaxies and observations , with most of the details of its derivation given in appendix  [ sec : form ] .",
    "section  [ sec : examp ] uses detailed models of a handful of real galaxies to examine a simplified procedure for  estimation .",
    "our updated analysis of the observed  trends in a large sample of galaxies follows , with the observational ingredients and their inter - correlations described in section  [ sec : data ] , and the full results presented in section  [ sec : obsres ] including a definitive confirmation of the large offset between spirals and ellipticals .",
    "these empirical  trends can be considered as fundamental , enduring tools for constraining theories of galaxy evolution . in section",
    "[ sec : theory ] we go on to connect the observations to generalized theoretical predictions for angular momentum in a modern cosmological context .",
    "we summarize in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "in addition , appendix  [ sec : form ] is an important part of this paper , providing an extended presentation of new content relating to the derivation of , which has been split off from the main text for the sake of readability .",
    "appendices  [ sec : obsapp][sec : decomp ] provide data tables of  and other properties of observed galaxies , along with detailed discussion of the observations and data analysis for a subsample of these galaxies .",
    "the reader looking for immediate answers to the questions above may wish to skip ahead to the results of sections  [ sec : obsresults ] and onwards .",
    "the foundation for this paper is a revised , general observational analysis of specific stellar angular momentum  for bright galaxies in the nearby universe .",
    "this quantity is most generally calculated by the following expression : @xmath14 where the subscript `` t '' denotes the `` true '' angular momentum in three - dimensional space , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the position and mean - velocity vectors ( with respect to the center of mass of the galaxy ) , and @xmath17 is the three - dimensional density of the population under study ( generally assumed to be stars in this project ) .    for spiral galaxies , we approximate the density distribution as an infinitely - thin , axisymmetric disk with an exponential surface density profile .",
    "assuming also a radially - constant rotation curve , equation  ( [ eqn : j3d ] ) yields the simple expression : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the intrinsic circular rotation velocity , and @xmath20 is the intrinsic exponential - disk scale length .",
    "these deprojected quantities are relatively easy to infer from observations because it is straightforward to estimate disk galaxy inclinations . equation  (    [ eqn : f83eq1 ] ) is widely used in the literature ( including in f83 ) , but we will demonstrate explicitly that it provides an excellent approximation to real galaxies whose rotation curves vary with radius .    for more general cases including elliptical galaxies , there is no established recipe equivalent to equation  ( [ eqn : f83eq1 ] ) . for multiple reasons , estimating  for these galaxies",
    "is much harder than for spirals .",
    "not only are their inclinations and intrinsic shapes uncertain , but large - radius rotation measurements are both more difficult and more critical .",
    "we illustrate the last point with some basic galaxy models . adopting the simple assumption of an axisymmetric system with cylindrical rotation that is constant with respect to the intrinsic radius @xmath21",
    ", we consider both a disk galaxy with an exponential surface density profile , and an elliptical galaxy with a standard @xcite @xmath22 profile .",
    "although ellipticals are in general triaxial systems , the axisymmetric model is sufficiently accurate for our purposes .",
    "figure  [ fig : fr ] then shows the cumulative distribution of angular momentum ( both total and specific ) with radius . for the disk galaxy ,",
    "the specific angular momentum reaches roughly half of its total value at the effective radius  that encloses half of the stellar light .",
    "this implies that observational estimates of  will be relatively easy for disk galaxies .    for the elliptical galaxy on the other hand , the halfway mark for",
    "is reached at 4.5  .",
    "this is because ellipticals contain a fairly large fraction of their light in their outer regions where the radius lever - arm in @xmath23 is large .",
    "the implication is that observations of elliptical galaxies need to extend to much larger radii than for spirals , in order to be confident of capturing the total .    typical stellar kinematics observations in 1983 extended to @xmath1  1  , and even today , only a small handful of galaxies",
    "have been observed kinematically out to @xmath1  5  , which means the positions of the ellipticals in the original ",
    "diagram ( figure  [ fig : jmm00 ] ) were highly uncertain , and continue to be challenging to determine with surety .",
    "fortunately , after a great deal of experimentation , which we will discuss below , we find that there is a heuristic approach where observations around @xmath1  2  can be used to estimate the total  of ellipticals with reasonable accuracy .",
    "returning to a general framework for estimating  from observations , there is not only the challenge of extending the data to large radii , but also of having only three of the six phase - space quantities in equation  ( [ eqn : j3d ] ) accessible ( i.e. , the projected positions and line - of - sight velocity ) .",
    "even the projection of @xmath24 on the sky involves unobservable velocity components tangential to the line of sight , and requires additional modeling assumptions .    to cope with these issues ,",
    "we will model the observed rotation and luminosity profiles of galaxies and convert these to  estimates using approximate deprojection factors .",
    "although these factors are based on highly simplified models , the dominant source of uncertainty is still the limited extent of the data to large radii .",
    "we derive in appendix  [ sec : form ] two alternative expressions for estimating from observations , both of them based again on the simplifying assumption of cylindrical rotation .",
    "the first expression starts with a detailed calculation of a `` projected '' specific angular momentum proxy that can be estimated directly from observations : @xmath25 here  is the observed profile of rotation velocity along the projected semi - major axis @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the surface density profile , again along the semi - major axis .",
    "the quantity  is related to  through a `` deprojection '' factor @xmath28 : @xmath29 therefore the problem of estimating  separates into two parts : the calculation of  from observations , and the factor @xmath28 which can be calibrated from theoretical models .    as we describe in appendix",
    "[ sec : form ] , this latter factor has some dependence on the detailed density  velocity structure of the galaxy , but is primarily a function of the inclination @xmath30 relative to the line of sight . for thin - disk galaxies",
    ", it is simply @xmath31 . with spheroidal galaxies , there is an additional dilution effect that comes from the line - of - sight intersecting the rotation field at non - tangent points . in principle",
    ", this effect is dependent on the detailed shape of the rotation profile , but we have found with simplified test models that such variations can be neglected in practice . we also find that as long as the major - axis radius @xmath26 , rather than a circularized radius @xmath21 , is used in equation  ( [ eqn : jmp ] ) , then @xmath28 is insensitive to galaxy flattening .",
    "a general approximation to @xmath28 as a function of inclination is provided by equation  ( [ eqn : cform ] ) .",
    "it is normally difficult to determine @xmath30 for spheroidal galaxies , and we will when needed adopt inclination - averaged values .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : jmp ] ) yields accurate results that are commensurate with the quality of modern observations , but involves numerical integration , and careful compilation of @xmath27 and  profiles along with extrapolation beyond the bounds of the data .",
    "we could in principle simplify the problem further by using parametric models for  and @xmath27 .",
    "unfortunately , the diversity of observed rotation profiles ( when non - spiral galaxies are considered ) defies parametrization .",
    "we can at least adopt for the surface density the general @xcite law which accurately represents a wide range of galaxy types : @xmath32,\\ ] ] where  is the effective radius along the _ semi - major axis _ , and",
    "the shape index @xmath33 determines the steepness of the outer density profile ( higher values are shallower : e.g. , an exponential disk profile has @xmath34 and the de vaucouleurs law for ellipticals has @xmath35 ) , while @xmath36 is a numerical function of @xmath33 [ equation  ( [ eqn : bn ] ) ] .",
    "we use this @xmath27 simplification in practice when deriving  from a detailed  profile in expression ( [ eqn : jmp ] ) .",
    "we also generally base our @xmath27 profiles on observations of stellar surface brightness profiles @xmath37 , assuming for simplicity that there are no variations of stellar mass - to - light ratio with radius ( e.g. , due to dust ) .",
    "our second method is a quick - and - dirty shortcut for estimating , as needed to generate an initial overview of the trends for a large sample of galaxies .",
    "we simply calculate the following linear scalar expression [ derived in appendix  [ sec : form ] from equation  ( [ eqn : jmp ] ) ] : @xmath38 where  means an approximation for , @xmath39 is the _ observed _ rotation velocity at some arbitrary measurement location @xmath40 , and @xmath41  15 is a numerical coefficient that depends on the srsic index @xmath33 of the galaxy [ see equation  ( [ eqn : kn ] ) ] . as in equation  ( [ eqn : proxy ] ) ,  is multiplied by @xmath28 to provide an approximate . here",
    "the basic idea is that a galaxy can be represented by a characteristic observed rotation velocity scale @xmath39 , a length scale , and a factor @xmath42 that relates to the moment of inertia ( discussed further below ) .",
    "the heuristic approximation that we make here is to select @xmath39 at @xmath43  2  for all galaxies .",
    "we will show in the next section that this choice allows us to estimate  with an accuracy of @xmath44  0.1  dex , which is good enough to start making some interesting inferences about trends in .    for @xmath35 spheroids ,",
    "the expression equivalent to equation  ( [ eqn : f83eq1 ] ) for spirals is : @xmath45 for a median , unknown inclination ( equation  ( [ eqn : j1 ] ) ) .",
    "an important concept with the more general expression ( [ eqn : jck0 ] ) is that @xmath42 increases strongly with @xmath33 ; for fixed galaxy size and rotation velocity , a more extended luminosity profile implies a higher owing to the large fraction of mass residing at large radii .",
    "this also means that a spheroidal ( @xmath46 ) galaxy with the _ same _ observed rotation @xmath39 and size  as a spiral has a _ larger _ specific angular momentum .",
    "late - type and early - type galaxies near the @xmath47 characteristic luminosity _ do _ have similar sizes for the same stellar mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore we can already make the basic prediction that if  at a fixed mass is independent of morphology , then the early - types should have @xmath39 values relative to late - types of @xmath48 , i.e. , lower by a factor of @xmath1  2 .",
    "the  formalism that we have outlined here represents a modest extension of the simpler methods in f83 .",
    "the improvements introduced here include allowance for a range of luminosity profiles ( not only @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) , and better treatment of elliptical galaxies where rotation at large radii is critically important .",
    "it also becomes more straightforward to understand the interplay between observations and uncertainties in the  estimates , as explored in the next section .",
    "before we move on to   analyses of a large sample of galaxies , we examine a small sample in more detail .",
    "the goals here are to illustrate the nature of the available data , to demonstrate that the simplified equations  ( [ eqn : f83eq1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : jck0 ] ) are good approximations to a full treatment with equation  ( [ eqn : jmp ] ) , and to understand some systematic effects in the  and  determinations .",
    "because this paper is concerned with the angular momentum bound up in the stellar components of galaxies , the preferred kinematic tracer comes from integrated - light absorption - line spectroscopy . in many cases",
    ", such data do not extend to large enough radii , so we make use of additional tracers as proxies for the field stars : cold and warm gas , planetary nebulae ( pne ) , and metal - rich globular clusters ( gcs ) .",
    "we consider disk- and bulge - dominated galaxies in sections  [ sec : disk ] and [ sec : bulge ] , respectively .",
    "we evaluate our simplified  estimate ( [ eqn : jck0 ] ) in section  [ sec : simp ] , describe our mass estimates in section  [ sec : mass ] , and then consider systematic uncertainties in section  [ sec : sys ] .",
    "the most straightforward galaxies for estimating angular momentum are the gas - rich spirals , since the stellar rotation profile , which can not always be measured directly , follows the gas rotation profile to a good approximation .",
    "also , the observed rotation can easily be corrected for projection effects in order to recover the intrinsic value ( see appendix  [ sec : thin ] ) .",
    "the detailed analysis below is overkill for these galaxies , whose  can be readily estimated through equation  ( [ eqn : f83eq1 ] ) , but we wish to illustrate how our more general treatment works for them , before moving on to the spheroids .",
    "we consider two real galaxies : ngc  3054 and ngc  3200 , which are well - studied disk - dominated spirals from the classic optical rotation curve analyses of @xcite .",
    "these cases are chosen to bracket the typical range of inner rotation profile shapes for spirals ( slowly and rapidly rising , respectively ) .",
    "we take the long - slit major - axis ionized - gas kinematics data from , shown in figure  [ fig : spirals ] after a modest amount of re - binning .",
    "these rotation profiles have high - frequency bumps and wiggles that are presumably caused by local perturbations such as spiral arms .",
    "fortunately , these features tend to average out when calculating a cumulative @xmath0 and are not important in this context .    to calculate the projected specific angular momentum , we carry out a piecewise integration of equation  ( [ eqn : jmp ] ) , using the major - axis rotation - velocity data  up to @xmath1  2  , along with simple power - law extrapolations at larger radii , as shown in figure  [ fig : spirals ] .",
    "for @xmath27 , we use an exponential model [ @xmath34 in equation  ( [ eqn : sersic ] ) ] , with the disk scale - lengths @xmath20 taken from @xmath49-band photometry as we will discuss in the next section . note that @xmath50 for a pure exponential disk .",
    "the resulting cumulative @xmath51 profiles with radius for these galaxies are shown in figure  [ fig : jmcum1 ] . here",
    "it would be trivial to convert @xmath51 immediately to @xmath52 using the known inclinations of these galaxies , but our general strategy is to focus first on the direct modeling of the observations for all galaxies , and later apply the deprojection factors @xmath28 , which involve different systematics .",
    "it can be seen that  hardly changes outside @xmath1  3  , and that the large - radius extrapolations make very little difference : the regions outside @xmath1  22.5  ( @xmath1  34  @xmath20 ) contain only @xmath1  8%15% of the total luminosity , and contribute only @xmath1  15%25% of the total ( half of  is enclosed within @xmath1  1.2  @xmath1  @xmath53 ; figure  [ fig : fr ] ) .",
    "given reasonable extrapolations of the data , the total  for these two galaxies , using our basic modeling assumptions , is constrained to @xmath1  5% ( @xmath1  0.02  dex ) .",
    "thus the kinematics is not a major source of uncertainty for  estimation in disk - dominated galaxies .",
    "additional complications that we have not considered here are deviations of the disk surface density profile from a simple constant mass - to - light ratio exponential model , and inclusion of a bulge ( to be discussed later )",
    ". we will examine more general systematic uncertainties in section  [ sec : sys ] .",
    "we now turn to the novel component of this paper , which is the careful treatment of  in early - type , bulge - dominated galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : fr ] demonstrated that traditional observations within 1  provide little assurance about the total angular momentum content of these systems , while even current cutting - edge observations out to @xmath1  5  might in principle not be adequate .",
    "here we analyze a sample of eight real galaxies in detail in order to characterize the accuracy of  estimations .",
    "seven of these galaxies were chosen because of the availability of high - quality extended kinematic data using integrated stellar light spectroscopy from two recent papers @xcite .",
    "both papers represent the first installments of systematic surveys of early - type galaxies in the local universe , and there is no obvious selection bias for the seven galaxies .",
    "five of them are `` ordinary '' near-@xmath47 early - types with central `` fast - rotator '' kinematics as is typical for such galaxies @xcite . the other two ( ngc  1407 and ngc  4374 @xmath54 m84 ) are examples of round , bright `` slow rotators '' that are common in high - density environments @xcite .",
    "five of these galaxies also have pn or gc kinematics data available @xcite , which we incorporate into our analysis in order to extend the range of galactocentric radii probed .",
    "we include an eighth galaxy in our sample , ngc  5128 ( cen  a ) , because it has the most extended ( pn ) kinematics data of any early - type galaxy in the literature @xcite",
    ". it may also be the remnant of a recent major merger ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which as discussed in section  [ sec : intro ] is expected to generally transfer angular momentum into the outer regions .",
    "analysis of this galaxy thus provides a golden opportunity to search for the `` missing '' angular momentum , and to see if any clear  difference emerges with respect to the other galaxies in the sample .",
    "the use of pne and gcs to provide proxies for stellar kinematics may seem risky , given the considerable uncertainties that remain about the parent stellar populations of these tracers .",
    "however , in most galaxies studied to date , both the density and kinematical profiles of pn and metal - rich gc systems have been found to correspond well to those of the full stellar population in the regions of overlap ( e.g. , ) .",
    "we have also verified that this is generally the case for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "further details of the observations as well as of the kinematical modeling are provided in appendix  [ sec : obsapp ] , along with the resulting rotation and angular momentum profiles .",
    "it should be emphasized that the careful , homogeneous construction of these profiles is laborious , which is why the current sample of galaxies that we consider in detail is relatively small .",
    "the rotation - velocity profiles of these eight galaxies are summarized in figure  [ fig : etg ] . unlike the spirals ( figure  [ fig : spirals ] ) , the early - types show great diversity in the characteristic shapes of their profiles .",
    "some are fairly constant with radius , others plummet rapidly from a central high value , and one continues increasing to the limits of the data .",
    "this diversity is _ not _ simply a matter of inclination , as can be seen by the divergent cases of ngc  821 and ngc  2768 , which are both highly flattened and probably close to edge - on .",
    "we thus find that the central rotation properties of early - type galaxies can not be used to reliably estimate the total angular momentum content , and there is probably no simple function that universally characterizes their full rotation - velocity profiles .    as with the spirals , we fit power laws to the outer regions of the rotation data in order to extrapolate to larger radii ( see appendix  [ sec : obsapp ] for further details ) .",
    "we then use equation  ( [ eqn : jmp ] ) to calculate profiles of cumulative  with radius , which we plot in figure  [ fig : jmcum1 ] .",
    "even though the data do not reach the total asymptotic value for , the requirement of a smooth power - law extrapolation for the rotation - velocity profile does in most cases strongly limit the total , which is typically determined at the @xmath55  15% level ( @xmath55  0.06  dex ) .",
    "the radius enclosing half of the total  varies from galaxy to galaxy depending on the shape of its rotation - velocity profile : 0.73  ( for the two spirals , it is 1  ) .",
    "the exceptions to these findings are the two bright , round ellipticals ngc  1407 and ngc  4374 .",
    "figure  [ fig : jmcum1 ] shows that much of the angular momentum in these galaxies is found at very large radii ( half of  within 9  and 4  , respectively ) , as expected from their fairly high srsic indices of @xmath56  48 ( the ordinary early - types have @xmath56  24 ) .",
    "however , beyond the usual uncertainties introduced by extrapolating the rotation velocity , there are a couple of other practical considerations .",
    "one issue is that although these particular galaxies have relatively well studied surface brightness profiles , many such massive ellipticals do not , with their @xmath33 and  values poorly known .",
    "this situation produces `` double jeopardy '' for angular momentum estimation , since both the luminosity and the rotation - velocity profiles at very large radii are important yet poorly constrained .",
    "the other issue demonstrated with ngc  4374 is that its cumulative  has not yet converged at the ( estimated total ) virial radius of @xmath1  35  , so it is not clear how its angular momentum should even be defined .",
    "this class of high-@xmath33 galaxies is clearly problematic , and we will consider any  results on them to be tentative for now",
    ".    figure  [ fig : jmcum1 ] also reveals a first glimpse of the basic result of this paper . for most of the early - types in the sample , there is relatively little angular momentum hidden beyond @xmath1  12  , and their total values of  are lower than those of the spirals .",
    "we will make more detailed comparisons later in this paper .",
    "we now arrive at a question that is critical for the wider survey of angular momentum in the rest of this paper : how accurate is the simplified equation ( [ eqn : jck0 ] ) ? as a reminder , this -estimator would replace the detailed calculations based on equation  ( [ eqn : jmp ] ) that we have carried out in the preceding subsections , but which are time - consuming to carry out for a larger sample of galaxies , and are not even possible for cases without very extended kinematic data .    in appendix",
    "[ sec : form ] , we have motivated the construction of equation  ( [ eqn : jck0 ] ) via toy models of galaxies , and calculated the corresponding coefficient @xmath42",
    ". we will now apply this formula to the set of ten real galaxies just discussed ( both late- and early - types ) , and find an optimum radial location @xmath40 for measuring the characteristic rotation velocity @xmath39 .    for each galaxy",
    ", it is straightforward to find the constant value of @xmath39 which when substituted in equation  ( [ eqn : jmp ] ) yields the same as with the full observed rotation - velocity profile .",
    "these results are listed in table  b[tab : gal ] and shown in figures  [ fig : spirals ] and [ fig : etg ] , where the intersection of @xmath39 with the rotation - velocity profile determines the characteristic measurement radius @xmath40 . as an example",
    ", for ngc  821 , it is clear that @xmath43  2 . for ngc  4494 on the other hand , a broad range of choices for @xmath40 would work , owing to its nearly constant rotation - velocity profile .",
    "considering this issue in more detail , we calculate  using equation  ( [ eqn : jck0 ] ) with an arbitrary choice for @xmath40 ( which in turn determines a guess for @xmath39 from the observed rotation velocity at this radius ) .",
    "the results for @xmath58 are shown in figure  [ fig : guess ] , plotted against  calculated in full from equation  ( [ eqn : jmp ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath59 provides a reasonably good match between  and  for all of the galaxies in this sample .",
    "the other radius choices fare worse , owing to galaxies like ngc  821 that have rotation - velocity profiles with a distinct transition between the inner and outer regions near 2  , and thus @xmath39 measurement elsewhere would be biased .    now to home in more finely on a choice for @xmath40 , in figure  [ fig : jrat ] we present the ratio of estimated and `` correct '' , as a function of the chosen @xmath40 , for each galaxy .",
    "some of the galaxies permit a broad range of choices for @xmath40 , while others do not .",
    "especially noteworthy again are the galaxies like ngc  821 and ngc  3377 which have sharp drops in their rotation - velocity profiles , so @xmath39 measured at small radii would overestimate  by factors of @xmath1  23 .",
    "we do not find a strong correlation between @xmath33 and optimal @xmath40 as expected from the simple models we constructed in appendix  [ sec : simpapp ] ; the dominant effect on @xmath40 with the real galaxy sample is the scatter in the shapes of the rotation - velocity profiles .",
    "future detailed analyses of a larger sample of galaxies may reveal systematic trends with @xmath33 that motivate improved  estimation methods , but for now we stick with our simple  approach .",
    "because the real galaxies so far do not show strongly rising outer rotation - velocity profiles , and if anything the reverse , @xmath43  2  appears to be a good overall choice for the rotation - velocity measurement radius .",
    "this minimizes the galaxy - to - galaxy scatter in the  approximation ( @xmath44  0.1  dex ) , and appears to produce little systematic bias ( @xmath60  0.1  dex ) .",
    "such `` errors '' are comparable to the uncertainties from carrying out the full  calculations , and are therefore acceptable for our purposes in this paper .",
    "one caveat here is that this sample of galaxies is still small , and we can not yet be sure of the universal validity of our approximation , e.g. , for the larger sample of galaxies that we will study in the remainder of this paper .",
    "however , we will show that there is no apparent systematic bias , i.e. , the overall scientific conclusions are consistent with the subset of detailed  profiles .",
    "so far we have focused on estimating , but the other key component in constructing the   diagram is of course the stellar mass . assuming that we have a well - determined surface brightness profile @xmath37 or total luminosity , we then need to know the stellar mass - to - light ratio . in this paper",
    ", we assume for simplicity that  is constant throughout each galaxy , which also means that its value is not relevant in our  calculations .",
    "estimating  in galaxies is a classic and not fully resolved problem .",
    "one standard approach is to use theoretical models for stellar populations in combination with observations of the stellar light ( e.g. , broad - band colors , or spectroscopic line indices ) .",
    "although there are well - known degeneracies between the ages and metallicities inferred for the stars , fortunately  can be estimated with more certainty ( e.g. , @xcite ) , modulo the initial mass function ( imf ) of the stellar populations .",
    "the imf affects the overall normalization of via the mass contributions of late - type dwarf stars or compact stellar remnants , which are observationally difficult to tally .",
    "if all galaxies have the same imf , then our analyses of the _ relative _ differences between galaxies in the   plane will be secure .",
    "there are also recent , indirect claims for possible galaxy - to - galaxy imf variations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , even in this case we do not expect a major impact on our conclusions .",
    "as an example , the recent analysis of @xcite implies that strong imf variations tend to occur in only the most massive , and relatively rare , early - type galaxies , which would have @xmath61 in our plots ( based on a standard imf ) . such galaxies might have masses larger than our estimates by factors of @xmath1  2 , but given the relatively small numbers of such galaxies and the weak constraints on their  values , they will have little effect on our estimated   trends .",
    "it is outside the scope of this paper to estimate  for each galaxy in detail .",
    "instead , we adopt the simplification that all galaxies have @xmath62 .",
    "the near infrared ( nir ) @xmath63-band is only mildly affected by internal and foreground extinction , is thought to be fairly insensitive to variations in stellar populations , and has uniform photometry available from the 2mass survey @xcite . the systematic variation in @xmath64 across our entire sample of late and early - type galaxies is conventionally expected to be no more than @xmath1  0.1  dex , based on @xmath65 colors @xcite , although there are recent suggestions of variations at the level of @xmath1  0.4 dex ( @xcite ) .",
    "our adopted value of @xmath62 is motivated by dynamical estimates in both spirals and lenticulars from @xcite , and corresponds to an imf midway between @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our calculations of  also require estimates of total luminosity , @xmath66 .",
    "however , we do _ not _ simply adopt the total magnitudes provided by the 2mass archive .",
    "these values are not reliable for early - type galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , particularly the variety with extended high-@xmath33 envelopes , where the 2mass values could be too faint by as much as 1 mag .    instead",
    ", we construct our own `` aperture corrections '' .",
    "we adopt the 2mass magnitudes within the 20@xmath67-mag isophote , @xmath68 , and use the best available optical photometry for each galaxy along with a srsic model fit to estimate the fraction of the galaxy light residing beyond @xmath68 .",
    "this procedure neglects any bandpass - dependence in the light profiles @xmath37 , which are often more radially extended in bluer bands ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such differences imply  variations with radius @xcite , which is a reminder of the limitations of our constant-  approximation . given our reliance on optical profiles @xmath37 to derive @xmath27 and estimate , as in equation  ( [ eqn : jmp ] ) , for consistency we do need to use the optical data to extrapolate the @xmath63-band photometry in estimating .",
    "however , the scale - lengths  of the stellar _ mass _ distributions are probably smaller on average than the  values that we use based on optical _ luminosity _ distributions , leading us to overestimate both  and .",
    "improvement on this point could be made in the future by analysis of deep @xmath37 data at nir wavelengths .",
    "nir spectroscopy would then also be needed for full consistency of both  and  estimates ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "here we focus on the   plane , our ultimate destination in this paper , but for now considering the projected specific angular momentum rather than the true  in order to isolate various effects that are disjoint from inclination uncertainties .",
    "figure  [ fig : jmm1 ] shows our detailed galaxy sample where cumulative @xmath69 is plotted not as a function of radius ( as in figure  [ fig : jmcum1 ] ) but of _ enclosed projected stellar mass _ , .    for reference , we show dashed lines corresponding to @xmath70 , with @xmath71 .",
    "this value for @xmath72 is motivated by previous observations ( section  [ sec : intro ] ) , and by theoretical predictions for - , given constant values of an initial halo spin parameter @xmath8 , as we will see in section  [ sec : theory1 ] .",
    "we are most concerned with the locations of galaxies relative to these tracks , and with any systematic effects that could shift the data in a direction _ perpendicular _ to them .",
    "the shaded regions of the curves in figure  [ fig : jmm1 ] indicate the uncertainties due to the kinematic data , including the extrapolations to large radii . for most of the galaxies ,",
    "the asymptotic position in the -  diagram is relatively well determined .",
    "the main exceptions are ngc  1407 and ngc  4374 , which as discussed before are extended giant ellipticals whose total  is very difficult to determine .",
    "the early - type galaxy ngc  2768 is also a concern even though the formal  uncertainties are small , since there are large contributions to the total  estimate from the region of extrapolation .",
    "an offset in total  between the late - types and most of the early - types as in figure  [ fig : jmcum1 ] is also apparent in figure  [ fig : jmm1 ] .",
    "however , the mass dimension brings the relative positions into sharper focus .",
    "for example , ngc  4374 and ngc  5128 have similar  values to ngc  3054 , but also have larger stellar masses , which means that their inferred halo spins will be _ lower _ ( considering distances perpendicular to the dashed tracks ) .",
    "we next consider some systematic uncertainties that apply even if the rotation - velocity profiles are perfectly measured .",
    "first , there is a typical distance uncertainty of @xmath1  10% .",
    "this affects  linearly and  quadratically , moving the position of the data by a very small amount nearly parallel to the @xmath8 tracks ( see sample error bars marked for ngc  3054 in the figure ) .",
    "next we consider an uncertainty of @xmath1  30% ( @xmath1  0.11  dex ) in the scale lengths , which translates into a similar uncertainty in  [ see equation  ( [ eqn : f83eq1 ] ) ] . also , in some cases the surface brightness profile is well constrained and the associated  uncertainty is very small ( e.g. , @xmath1  5% or @xmath1  0.02  dex in the case of the @xmath73 elliptical ngc  4494 ) .",
    "finally there is , which may be uncertain by a factor of @xmath1  50% ( @xmath1  0.2  dex ) and would affect  by the same amount . for spiral galaxies ,",
    "this is probably the limiting factor for inferring their @xmath8 values . for the early - types ,",
    "the inclination is generally unknown and may be a significant source of uncertainty for estimating , even when  is well constrained .",
    "we will return to this theme in section  [ sec : less ] .",
    "having carried out detailed analyses of  for a handful of galaxies in the previous section , we now derive  for a much larger galaxy sample , using simpler methods .",
    "besides these derivations , in this section we also examine some basic scaling relations for galaxies , in order to understand the observational underpinnings of the ",
    "results in the next section , and to verify that our results are consistent with some well - known properties of galaxies .",
    "we also introduce a novel , generalized version of the tully - fisher relation for galaxies of all types .",
    "those who are keen to get straight to the angular momentum results may wish to skip to section  [ sec : obsresults ] .    in order to populate the observational ",
    "diagram , we will use the  approximation of equation  ( [ eqn : jck0 ] ) which we have found to be generally accurate at the @xmath1  0.1  dex ( @xmath1  25% ) level .",
    "the basic parameters that we then need for all of the galaxies are : the total stellar mass ( ) and its scale - length ( @xmath20 or ) , the srsic index @xmath33 , and the characteristic rotation velocity @xmath39 .",
    "the distances to the galaxies are estimated from redshifts and surface brightness fluctuations . as discussed in section  [ sec : mass ] ,  is derived from aperture - corrected 2mass magnitudes @xmath74 , assuming @xmath62 .",
    "the other parameters are derived differently for the late - type and early - type samples , as we will discuss in sections  [ sec : ltgdata ] and [ sec : etgdata ] , respectively .",
    "section  [ sec : scale ] brings the data together in an examination of basic scaling relations , before proceeding to the final   analyses of section  [ sec : obsres ] .      because spiral galaxies are dominated by their disk components , whose photometric and kinematic properties are relatively straightforward to measure , past studies of their angular momenta",
    "have generally treated them as pure disks , e.g. , using equation  ( [ eqn : f83eq1 ] ) to calculate . however , this approximation may be inadequate for the spirals with relatively large bulges ( sa and some sb ) , and it is one of the goals of this paper to consider these components .    with equation  ( [ eqn : jck0 ] ) in mind , we could use values for the parameters @xmath33 , , and @xmath75 that characterize the composite bulge  disk systems ( e.g. , with an overall @xmath33 somewhat larger than @xmath76 ) .",
    "however , the required stellar photometry and kinematic data are not available for a large sample of galaxies .",
    "instead , we analyze disk and bulge components separately , make some simple assumptions for the bulges to compensate for the missing data , and then combine the disks and bulges into global  analyses .",
    "we focus on the classic spiral galaxy data set assembled by @xcite , comprising 64 galaxies from type sa to sm , at distances ranging from 1 to 100  mpc .",
    "these data include @xmath49-band ccd photometry along with bulge / disk decompositions , and inclination - corrected gas - disk rotation curves from both optical emission - lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) and hi radio emission ( based on various sources in the literature ) .",
    "most of kent s sample comes from the rubin et  al",
    ".  surveys , which selected for spiral galaxies with high inclinations , spanning a wide range of luminosities , scale - lengths , and hubble types , and without strong bars . despite advances in observational resources in the intervening decades ,",
    "we know of no comparable , publicly - available sample that includes both rotation curves and photometry with detailed bulge / disk decompositions for a wide range of disk - galaxy types .",
    "we estimate the disk and bulge scale - lengths ( @xmath20 and @xmath77 ) by modeling the nonparametric kent decompositions with simple exponential and de vaucouleurs profiles ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively ) .",
    "our models thereby treat all bulges as `` classical '' , with @xmath46 , neglecting some variations in their detailed properties , such as the @xmath78  12 indices of `` pseudo '' bulges .",
    "the latter bulges tend to be much less massive , and make only minor contributions to the total  for spirals , which is insensitive to the details of the adopted bulge density and rotation profiles .    for 34 of these sample galaxies ( type sb to sc ) , independent decompositions were carried out on the _ same data set _ by @xcite , using parametric fits to the raw surface brightness profiles .",
    "our @xmath20 values agree with theirs at the @xmath1  10% level , while the bulge results are highly variable , both between our analyses and theirs , and between different model fits by these authors .",
    "most of these galaxies are very disk dominated ( @xmath79 ) , so it is not surprising that the bulge parameters would be very uncertain .",
    "fortunately the bulges in such cases turn out to be only very minor contributors to the total  of their host galaxies .",
    "other parameters and their sources are listed in table  c[tab : spirals ] .    for @xmath39 of the stellar disk components of these galaxies",
    ", we assume that they rotate with the same velocities as their gas disks .",
    "we derive @xmath7 based on the rotation curves over the range ( 23 )  @xmath20 , re - projecting this intrinsic value to the observed @xmath39 according to the inclination ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the final and most challenging parameter to estimate is the characteristic rotation velocity @xmath39 for the bulges .",
    "direct estimates of bulge rotation - velocity profiles over a large range in radius require extensive spectroscopic data combined with careful bulge  disk kinematic decomposition . as far as we know ,",
    "this has only been done for _ one _ spiral galaxy to date @xcite .",
    "thus we are much worse off with estimating  for spiral bulges than for early - type galaxies , and must make even stronger simplifying assumptions than in the original f83 analysis of ellipticals .",
    "fortunately , because the spirals are disk - dominated , we will find that their total  estimates are only mildly sensitive to the assumptions about bulge kinematics .",
    "our strategy for the bulge @xmath39 values is to estimate these indirectly , based on other observables : the ellipticity @xmath81 and the central velocity dispersion @xmath82 .",
    "these three parameters may be related together through the following model : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a parameter describing the relative dynamical importance of rotation and pressure . in an edge - on galaxy",
    ", @xmath85 represents an oblate isotropic system where the observed ellipticity is supported by rotation , and this model also turns out to work well at other inclinations @xcite .",
    "the standard lore is that spiral bulges and low - luminosity ellipticals are near oblate - isotropic , with typical @xmath86  0.9 @xcite .",
    "however , some concerns about these conclusions were raised early on @xcite and modern integral - field analysis of early - types has revealed that their rotation velocities tend to be significantly _ lower _ than in the oblate isotropic model @xcite .",
    "the rotation of spiral bulges , on the other hand , has not seen systematic investigation in decades ( some new work has just appeared in @xcite ) , and here we attempt only a quick look at the implications of recent papers that have reported bulge kinematics for a handful of cases .",
    "we take results on @xmath87 and @xmath88 from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and plot them in figure  [ fig : vsigb ] .",
    "we see that the oblate isotropic model is _ not _ a good representation of most of the data , nor is any other simple value of @xmath84 .",
    "however , in order to have a simplified framework for bulge rotation , we characterize this data set as having @xmath89 ( median and 68% scatter ) .",
    "we therefore adopt the following procedure for estimating bulge .",
    "we use the observational values for @xmath88 and @xmath82 , and then estimate @xmath39 using equation  ( [ eqn : binney ] ) with @xmath90 representing a typical value for bulges .",
    "we test the impact of the latter assumption on the results by also using @xmath91 and @xmath92 to bracket the possible range of average bulge rotation .",
    "we thereby explore the systematic uncertainty in bulge rotation but not the intrinsic scatter , keeping in mind also that this bulge model is based on the central regions and does not account for the uncertainties in extrapolating the rotation to large radii , as discussed in detail for the early - type galaxies .",
    "the @xmath88 values are taken from the kent derivations .",
    "we take the @xmath82 measurements in most cases from hyperleda , and also from and . for some of the later - type galaxies , there are no @xmath82 measurements available , and for these we use an empirical relation ( which we infer from other galaxies in these studies ) that @xmath82 is approximately equal to the gas - disk rotation velocity .",
    "such cases all have @xmath93 , so this approximation is not of major importance for the total  estimates , but any inferences for these particular bulges will be relatively uncertain .",
    "we now have enough information to proceed with the specific angular momentum calculations for the spiral galaxies .",
    "again , our basic approach is to estimate separately the bulge and disk angular momenta @xmath94 and @xmath95 . given a bulge stellar mass fraction quantified as @xmath96 , we can then estimate the total specific angular momentum by : @xmath97 in practice , we use the bulge - to - total @xmath49-band luminosity ratio @xmath13 ( from the series of kent papers ) as a proxy for @xmath96 .    to calculate the projected values of @xmath94 and @xmath95 , we use equation  ( [ eqn : jck0 ] ) . for the intrinsic values",
    ", we assume that both the bulge and the disk in a given galaxy have the same inclination @xmath30 , which is estimated from the observed disk ellipticity .",
    "we then use the deprojection factor @xmath28 to convert projected to intrinsic values [ see equation  ( [ eqn : proxy ] ) ] .",
    "for the disk , this is a simple factor of @xmath98 , and the calculation reduces to equation  ( [ eqn : f83eq1 ] ) . for the bulge , we calculate @xmath28 from equation  ( [ eqn : cform ] ) .",
    "using these procedures , we construct a catalog of spiral galaxies with characteristic masses , scale - lengths , and rotation velocities for both their bulge and disk components .",
    "we report these values in table  c[tab : spirals ] , along with the total galactic specific angular momenta ( bulge and disk combined ) , both projected and intrinsic .",
    "when we vary the assumed bulge rotation systematically across the bracketing range , the total  is changed by no more than @xmath1  0.03  dex ( @xmath1  7% ) for the vast majority of the galaxies , and up to @xmath1  0.1  dex ( @xmath1  25% ) for a few of the sa  sab galaxies .",
    "therefore the details of the bulge modeling are of only very mild importance to the overall  results for the spirals .",
    "these data will be used in later sections to examine various scaling relations for these galaxies and for their subcomponents .      for the gas - poor early - type galaxies ( lenticulars and ellipticals ) , the challenge is to assemble a large sample with all of the ingredients that we need to calculate  ( i.e. , @xmath39 , , @xmath33 ) .",
    "the information is scarcest for @xmath39 , and therefore we have scoured the literature for kinematic data sets extending to radii of at least @xmath1  2  , assembling a sample that , although not exhaustive , is unprecedented in its size and scope .",
    "the sources include integrated - starlight absorption - line spectroscopy , and velocities of gcs and pne .",
    "to estimate approximate values for @xmath39 , we simply read off the major - axis rotation velocity at 2   ( as explained in section  [ sec : simp ] ) .",
    "we thereby assemble a total sample of 40 early - type galaxies , including the 8 galaxies that we modeled in detail in section  [ sec : examp ] .",
    "table  c[tab : etg ] provides a summary of our sample , along with the sources of kinematic data .",
    "given that the data are drawn from a variety of literature sources with complex selection effects , it is important to check whether or not the sample is a fair representation of early - types in the nearby universe .",
    "we have done so in appendix  [ sec : obsfull ] , using the 3d  volume - limited sample of nearby galaxies as a reference , and focusing on the masses  and central rotation parameters @xmath84 .",
    "we find that the distribution of our sample galaxies in the @xmath84parameter space is fairly similar to that of an unbiased sample over a similar mass range .",
    "the median galaxy mass in our sample is @xmath99 , which is near the characteristic mass @xmath100 of nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "we thus conclude that our observational results should be representative of low - redshift ordinary early - type galaxies .",
    "the only caveat here is that our sample is biased toward ellipticals at the expense of lenticulars , which we must take into account later when drawing conclusions about the overall population of early - type galaxies .",
    "an alternative scheme for classifying early - types is as `` fast rotators '' ( including almost all lenticulars ) and `` slow rotators '' , based on their central kinematics @xcite .",
    "the central rotation is known to correlate with many other galaxy properties @xcite , and the fast and slow rotators have been interpreted as having different formation histories . therefore it is important that we investigate to what extent the _ global _ specific angular momentum correlates with the central rotation classification .",
    "our sample includes three slow - rotators , which is consistent with the fraction of such galaxies in the nearby universe @xcite , and will provide a rough initial idea of any systematic differences between fast and slow rotators .    returning to the remaining observational parameters , for each early - type density profile , we need both the srsic index @xmath33 and the corresponding scale - length  ( which can differ significantly from the value obtained with a classic @xmath35 fit , e.g. , in the rc3 catalog of @xcite ) . unfortunately there is no comprehensive source available for such measurements , and we resort to a medley of literature data .    for 34 of the galaxies in our sample ,",
    "there are published srsic fits , and we take the @xmath101 values according to the following priority : detailed photometric analysis in individual galaxy papers ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; the @xcite tabulation for virgo galaxies ; @xcite .    for the remaining 6 galaxies , we have as a starting point the rc3 value for the effective radius",
    ". then we use the well - established observation that there are strong correlations between early - type galaxy size and luminosity , and the srsic index @xmath33 ( e.g. , ) .",
    "this allows us to estimate a most - probable @xmath33 value for each galaxy ( see appendix  [ sec : obsfull ] for details ) .",
    "note that if we were simply to approximate all of the early - types as @xmath35 spheroids , the @xmath42 values in equation  ( [ eqn : jck0 ] ) would be too high on average by @xmath1  30% ( @xmath1  0.15  dex , given a median index value of @xmath102 ) .",
    "this would translate to an equivalent systematic error on .",
    "we could adjust for this effect by adopting @xmath103 in all cases , but @xmath33 also has a systematic dependence on galaxy mass , and ignoring this fact would produce a spurious mass - dependent trend in  of @xmath1  50% ( @xmath1  0.2  dex ) over the full range in mass .",
    "in table  c[tab : etg ] , we compile the observed parameters @xmath39 , , and @xmath33 for our full early - type galaxy sample .",
    "we use these to calculate  approximately from equation  ( [ eqn : jck0 ] ) , and tabulate these values as well . for some of the very extended galaxies like ngc  4374 , the total luminosity and angular momentum ( via the factor @xmath42 ) are integrated out only to the estimated virial radius .    in order",
    "to convert projected  to intrinsic  for analysis in later sections , we must apply a deprojection factor @xmath28 which depends on the inclination @xmath30 .",
    "unfortunately , the individual inclinations are not generally known , but neither are they completely random , because of an inclination - bias in galaxy classification .",
    "as discussed in appendix  [ sec : spheroid ] , we therefore apply median deprojection factors of @xmath104 ( @xmath105  dex ) to the lenticulars , and @xmath106 ( @xmath107  dex ) to the ellipticals .    since one of our eventual goals will be to quantify the intrinsic scatter in the observed   relations , it is important to be clear about the error budget in our analyses .",

    "these conclusions hold for both  and , although the uncertainties and the scatter are smaller for , as expected if there are genuine , underlying physical correlations that become clearer after deprojection .",
    "the multi - component nature of our model galaxies allows us to look further at disk and bulge properties separately .",

    "it should be remembered that the bulge results depend on model assumptions , although as discussed , we have plausibly bracketed their upper and lower limits for .",
    "as anticipated , the bulges turn out to have little impact on the total  trends for the sb  sm galaxies , which are dominated by the disk components . for the sa  sab galaxies , the bulges are responsible for the systematic offset with respect to the later types",
    "; this offset changes slightly but persists when adopting the upper or lower limits to the bulge rotation .",
    "the _ disks _ of all the galaxy types turn out to follow nearly the same   relations .",
    "this analysis demonstrates that inclination effects are not expected to have a major impact on our overall results , since for both disks and bulges , the intrinsic and projected ",
    "trends as well as their scatter are very similar .",
    "there is an overall offset between disk  and  of @xmath1  0.07  dex , which is comparable to the range of 0.040.06  dex that we would expect , given the median inclination @xmath116 of our sample , and depending on whether the   trend represents a median or an average fit ( see appendix  [ sec : thin ] for further discussion ) .    for our ensuing study of early - type galaxies",
    ", we will therefore simply adopt median deprojection values for all of the galaxies , which we estimated in section  [ sec : etgdata ] to mean adding offsets of 0.08  dex and 0.22  dex to  to derive , for lenticulars and ellipticals , respectively .",
    "we can also in general drop the usage of  in the rest of this paper , in favor of the more physically meaningful  which we now adopt as our estimate for .",
    "we are now ready to include the early - type galaxies in our analysis , and thereby address most of the key science questions raised in section  [ sec : intro ] . as a reminder ,",
    "our starting point is the ",
    "diagram from f83 that we have reproduced in figure  [ fig : jmm00 ] .",
    "do we find the same   trends with an updated and expanded dataset , and more detailed analysis ? do ellipticals still appear to have systematically low  relative to spirals , or",
    "do we discover large reservoirs of additional  at large galactocentric radii , using modern data ?",
    "do sa and s0 galaxies fill in any `` gap '' between spirals and ellipticals , and can we then connect the hubble sequence to a sequence in ?",
    "can we characterize all galaxies as combinations of disks and bulges that follow universal scaling relations ?",
    "( the main remaining question that connects to galaxy formation theory will be pursued in the next section . )    taking our early - type galaxy  and  estimates from table  c[tab : etg ] ( after statistically correcting projected to intrinsic quantities ; see table  [ tab : err ] for an error analysis ) , we plot them in figure  [ fig : jmm0 ] ( left ) , along with the spirals results discussed in section  [ sec : less ] .",
    "this new figure is the centerpiece of our paper . _",
    "focusing first on the elliptical galaxies , our basic finding is that they follow a ",
    "trend which is roughly parallel to the spirals but with a large systematic offset to lower .",
    "_    we thereby confirm the conclusions of f83 , finding from a new synthesis of modern photometric and kinematic data that the `` missing '' angular momentum in ellipticals does _ not _ emerge at large radii , as had been expected from some theoretical studies . as discussed in section  [ sec : scale ] , the new observations tend to show outer rotation profiles that _ decline _ rather than rise",
    ". even the nearby galaxy ngc  5128 ( cen  a ) , which is often considered to be an elliptical formed through a recent major merger , shows a relatively low  when compared to spirals of the same stellar mass . whether or not these observations pose a genuine problem to major - merger explanations for forming ellipticals will require renewed theoretical analysis , but as discussed in section  [ sec : scale ] , there seems to be a pattern in the literature of misdiagnoses of high outer rotation from early , sparse data  which led to premature claims of evidence for major mergers .",
    "the specific angular momentum difference between spirals and ellipticals is also apparent from a simple , direct consideration of the data in section  [ sec : scale ] , where the smaller sizes and rotation velocities for ellipticals suggested that they have lower . as an arbitrary benchmark",
    ", we use the median  at the @xmath47 characteristic luminosity , which is @xmath117 , corresponding to @xmath118 . for ellipticals and sb  sm spirals ,",
    "we find projected values of @xmath119  kpc and @xmath120  kpc , respectively , and true values of @xmath121  kpc and @xmath122  kpc .",
    "in more detail , we report fits to the   data toward the end of table  [ tab : loglog ] .",
    "the fitted slope for the ellipticals is consistent with that for the sb  sm spirals , but is significantly offset to lower  by a factor of @xmath1  3.4 ( @xmath1  0.5 dex ) .",
    "these findings are consistent with f83 , except that the gap has narrowed from a factor of @xmath1  6 ( @xmath1  0.8  dex ) .",
    "0.1  dex lower than in f83 , partly owing to the inclusion of bulges , and partly to new estimates for disk sizes and mass - to - light ratios .",
    "our revised ellipticals relation is @xmath1  0.2  dex higher than in f83 ; this difference appears to arise not so much from the rotation data ( the extrapolations to large radius by f83 turn out very good on average ) , but from a refined treatment of the total angular momentum calculation for spheroids .",
    "our slopes of @xmath123 and @xmath124 for the sb  sm and elliptical galaxies are shallower than the @xmath125 slope suggested by f83 ; for the sb  sm galaxies , this difference is driven mostly by our inclusion of bulges and of lower - mass galaxies [ @xmath126  9 ] ; while for the ellipticals , a shallower slope was already apparent in f83 . ]",
    "note that if the @xmath63-band  for the ellipticals were systematically higher than for the spirals by a factor of @xmath1  2 ( perhaps owing to age or imf differences ; cf .",
    "section  [ sec : mass ] ) , then the  offset would increase to a factor of @xmath1  5 ( @xmath1  0.7  dex ) .",
    "the scatter of @xmath127  0.24  dex for the ellipticals is similar to the  scatter for the spirals .",
    "we also note that the general trends for the ellipticals are supported by the small sample of galaxies that we modeled in detail ( see points with error bars in figure  [ fig : jmm0 ] , left ) .",
    "although one might still have concerns that large formal uncertainties in  remain for most of the sample after extrapolating their rotation - velocity profiles beyond 2  , in order to close the  gap between spirals and ellipticals , the rotation velocity would have to rise rapidly by a factor of @xmath1  4 outside these radii , which seems implausible ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : etg ] ) .",
    "the parallel nature of the spiral and elliptical trends is an interesting and non - trivial result , since figure  [ fig : rot ] showed that the slopes of the rotation - velocity scaling relations for these galaxies have opposite signs .",
    "some mass - dependent conspiracy of size , rotation velocity , and srsic index must be at work in order for the ",
    "slopes to turn out the same .",
    "the few `` slow rotator '' ellipticals in our sample show no indication of deviating systematically from the overall ",
    "trend for ellipticals , which disagrees with earlier findings of much lower  for such galaxies .",
    "although their outer regions , like their central parts , rotate slowly relative to most of the fast rotators ( figure  [ fig : rot ] ) , we find that this is compensated for by their larger scale radii and srsic indices ( keeping in mind that the results for these galaxies are the most uncertain ) .",
    "thus the global  measurements suggest that the slow and fast rotators may have more in common than was previously suspected .",
    "having confirmed the basic observational findings of f83 , we now move on to fresh territory , beginning with the inclusion of sa and s0 galaxies in figure  [ fig : jmm0 ] ( left ) .",
    "f83 suggested that these would fill the gap in ",
    "space between ellipticals and late - type spirals , which is confirmed by our sample .",
    "both of these galaxy types are on average offset to lower  from the sb  sm spirals trend by a factor of @xmath1  1.8 ( @xmath1  0.25 dex ; we will discuss variations about the average in section  [ sec : resid ] ) .",
    "one natural interpretation of this new finding is that the hubble classifications are related to an underlying physical structure , where all galaxies are composed of some combination of two basic components : a disk and a spheroid ( as illustrated schematically in figure  [ fig : schem1 ] of section  [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "these components would define two distinct sequences in the   plane , which in combination would move the total values of galaxies to intermediate regions in this plane , depending on the bulge - to - total mass ratios , @xmath13 .",
    "to explore this idea , we plot the ",
    "data separately for elliptical galaxies , and for spiral disk and bulge subcomponents , in the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : jmm0 ] .",
    "the disks follow a similar relation to spiral galaxies overall , since these are dominated by their disks .",
    "more remarkably , the   trend for _ bulges _ is fairly similar to the trend for ellipticals over the mass range where they overlap .",
    "this is a surprising result , because as shown in figure  [ fig : size ] , the bulge _ sizes _ are systematically smaller than the ellipticals , and thus their rotation velocities ( figure  [ fig : rot ] ) must be higher , in an apparent conspiracy to produce roughly the same .",
    "a similar analysis could in principle be carried out for the fast - rotator ellipticals , since they are widely considered to host hidden , embedded disk - like components .",
    "do the disk and bulge subcomponents of ellipticals follow the same   relations as those of the spirals ? we have investigated this question in appendix  [ sec : decomp ] using decompositions from the literature , but the results are somewhat ambiguous .",
    "thus , although we have been able to address all of the major questions raised initially about empirical   trends , we flag the trends for the subcomponents in ellipticals ( and lenticulars ) as an important aspect remaining in need of clarification .",
    "the foregoing discussion brings us to the diagram that we have already introduced schematically with figure  [ fig : schem1 ] , which constitutes our own , physically - motivated , substitute for the classic hubble tuning fork , and which could provide the underlying explanation for the observational trends found in figure  [ fig : jmm0 ] . in this scheme ,",
    "all galaxies are composed of a disk and a bulge , each adhering to a distinct and parallel   scaling relation .",
    "if the disk and bulge relations are universal ( which we will further test in section  [ sec : resid ] ) , then the location of a galaxy in   space can immediately be used to infer its @xmath13 value uniquely , and vice - versa ( i.e. , there is a coordinate transformation between the two parameter spaces ) .",
    "elliptical galaxies would then be the cases with @xmath128 , and bulges could be thought of as mini - ellipticals .    as with the original hubble diagram ,",
    "our   diagram provides a simple _ description _ of galaxies , along with the temptation to interpret it as some kind of _ evolutionary sequence_. however , our diagram differs , since the parameters used are physical quantities that may in principle be conserved , and thus it is actually justified to begin using the diagram directly as a tool to motivate and test some evolutionary scenarios for galaxies",
    ". this will be the objective of section  [ sec : theory ] .",
    "a key feature of our diagram is that it views galaxies as fundamentally populating a space of _ two parameters _ , angular momentum and mass , which are nearly equivalent to the more observationally accessible properties of bulge fraction and luminosity . in this framework , galaxies _ can not _ be fruitfully reduced to a one - dimensional family controlled by a single parameter ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    our diagram",
    "may also be contrasted with another currently fashionable way to understand galaxies : as color - magnitude sequences that are generally related to star formation histories ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these properties are loosely related to   space if star formation generally occurs in high-  disks . however , our framework is less astronomical and more astrophysical in nature , and we expect it to provide novel insights to galaxy formation that are complementary to other classifications , and perhaps more fundamental .",
    "another recently - introduced classification for galaxies is also based loosely on specific angular momentum concepts : @xmath129 @xcite , which measures the rotational dominance in the central regions ( typically inside @xmath130 ) and is similar to a @xmath131 metric .",
    "applied to early - type galaxies , a host of interesting patterns and correlations have emerged @xcite .",
    "however , this metric in practice is not only very scale dependent , but also misses exactly those scales that are most important for measuring true , physical angular momentum ( recall figure  [ fig : fr ] ) .",
    "in fact , we have seen evidence that  and the central @xmath129 are disjoint properties : the slow rotators ( low-@xmath129 galaxies ) do not appear to deviate from the   trend for fast rotators .",
    "a final related diagram to mention is @xmath7 , where @xmath7 is the circular velocity , tracing the dynamical mass of a galaxy within some characteristic radius ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are complications with using this parameter space , since for spiral galaxies both  and @xmath7 are normally based on the same rotation - velocity measurements , which causes a built - in correlation . unlike , @xmath7 is not a physical quantity subject to straightforward conservation laws . in addition",
    ", a critical point for our goal of analyzing all types of galaxies in a unified manner is that it is very hard to estimate @xmath7 for a large sample of early - types since they rarely host extended gas disks . instead , extensive data are required from other tracers such as stellar kinematics ( as needed for  estimation ) , as well as grueling dynamical modeling which even with the state - of - the art techniques can still leave considerable uncertainties @xcite .",
    "similar problems apply to a ",
    "( virial mass ) diagram , where the masses can be estimated only on a statistical rather than on an individual basis ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our bulge  disk framework , although rather compelling , is not a unique explanation for the systematic trends in the left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : jmm0 ] .",
    "it is possible that the vertical displacements of  in this diagram are somehow more directly related to hubble morphology than to @xmath13 ( although one should keep in mind that @xmath13 is one of the main factors in the morphological classifications , along with spiral arm winding and clumpiness ) .    to consider this point more clearly , and to better see the relative trends in the data , we flatten the relations into one dimension , dividing by the mean trend for the spiral disks and thus generating the quantity : @xmath132 where @xmath133 is given by equation  ( [ eqn : loglog ] ) .",
    "we plot  versus the hubble stage parameter @xmath134 in figure  [ fig : diffj ] ( left - hand panel ) .",
    "there is clearly a strong positive correlation between @xmath134 and the",
    "  residuals . among the spirals ,",
    "this trend is clearest when considering the sa ",
    "sab versus sb  sc galaxies .",
    "the scd  sm galaxies appear to continue the trend , but they inhabit the lowest - mass area of the   diagram , where the mean relation is not defined well enough to be certain of the residuals .    the s0s break the smooth trend of  decreasing for smaller @xmath134 .",
    "many of them appear to have comparable specific angular momenta to typical sb  sc galaxies , which was foreshadowed by the rotation scaling relations of figure  [ fig : rot ] .",
    "the implication is that lenticulars and spirals are overall dynamically similar , differing more in their finer morphological features which may be related to star formation activity .",
    "we can thus think of these lenticulars as faded spirals , or of the spirals as rejuvenated lenticulars , although they differ in average @xmath13 values , and more nuanced comparisons will require analysis of ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . as for the subset of lenticulars with low",
    ", they may either be very close to face - on , or else belong to a different family of objects that are related to the ellipticals .",
    "returning to our original hypothesis that @xmath13 is the key parameter affecting the",
    "  trends , we consider its correlation with the residuals . since we do not actually have bulge / disk decompositions for the early - type galaxies in our sample , we introduce a novel technique that uses the degree of central rotational support as a rough proxy for @xmath13 .",
    "the idea here is that the bulge is to a first approximation non - rotating , so any observed rotation is from the disk : objects with higher @xmath87 imply higher disk fractions and lower @xmath13 .",
    "appendix  [ sec : decomp ] describes our methods for early - type @xmath13 estimation in more detail . for the late - types",
    ", we already have @xmath13 estimates based on decompositions in the literature , as discussed earlier .",
    "we show the results in the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : diffj ] .",
    "the residuals _ do _ correlate clearly with @xmath13 , in a fairly smooth trend that is followed equally well by all of the galaxy types , and which contrasts with the @xmath134 trend .",
    "we have marked a simple expectation for the @xmath13 trend with the curved line , given the summation of equation  ( [ eqn : jtot ] ) , along with an arbitrarily assumed @xmath135 .",
    "this model mimics the data remarkably well , although it should be remembered that the agreement is somewhat built - in already , since correlated rotational properties were used both to estimate @xmath13 and to calculate .",
    "recalling that we also had to make strong modeling assumptions for the spiral bulges when calculating , the better connection of the residuals to @xmath13 rather than @xmath134 should be considered preliminary .",
    "it is also difficult to tell how much of the scatter in  at fixed @xmath13 is due to observational error , and how much is due to intrinsic variations , i.e. , with bulges and/or disks not following perfectly standardized   relations .",
    "definitive resolution of these issues will require more detailed bulge ",
    "disk decompositions of all types of galaxies , including spectroscopic information ( cf .",
    "@xcite    ) , and allowances for  variations .",
    "we would however like to advance the proposition that bulge fraction is the fundamental driving parameter behind  variations , and is responsible for many of the observed variations in galaxy properties ( see discussion in previous subsection ) .",
    "not only does this make sense from a physical standpoint , but the agreements between ellipticals and spiral bulges in figure  [ fig : jmm0 ] ( right ) , and between model and data in figure  [ fig : diffj ] ( right ) , provide provisional but strongly suggestive observational support .",
    "the radially - declining rotation - velocity profiles of galaxies like ngc  821 and ngc  3377 in figure  [ fig : etg ] could also be naturally explained by central disk components embedded in non - rotating bulges .",
    "furthermore , we will see from consideration of a cosmological context in section  [ sec : theory2 ] that the distribution of  is more naturally reconciled with distinct disk and spheroid subpopulations than with a simple continuum of galaxy .      before moving on to theoretical analyses ,",
    "we construct one more representation of the data whose relevance will become particularly clear in the next section .",
    "we compress the preceding   information into a histogram of residuals from the spiral disk relation , showing the results in figure  [ fig : histdiff ] ( upper panel ) .",
    "here it is apparent that the spiral galaxy data comprise a roughly lognormal distribution in @xmath136 , with an rms dispersion of @xmath1  0.2 dex .",
    "the ellipticals have a less well - defined distribution that partially overlaps the spirals but is offset @xmath1  0.5 dex lower , while the small sample of lenticulars spans almost the full range of residuals .    in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : histdiff ]",
    ", we look instead at the disk and bulge subcomponents of the spiral galaxies , where we have also overplotted a gaussian with a width of @xmath137  dex for reference . given the uncertainties and possible selection bias in our analysis , we consider the disks to be reasonably consistent with a lognormal distribution .",
    "the  distribution for the spiral bulges resembles that of the ellipticals in the sense that both are systematically offset to lower values , as we have previously seen .",
    "the bulges apparently extend to much lower  than the ellipticals , but as discussed in section  [ sec : obsresults ] , this is not a secure result , given the uncertainties in the bulge calculations .",
    "returning to the overall results , we would like to know whether or not galaxies follow a bimodal distribution in  as the top panel of figure  [ fig : histdiff ] suggests .",
    "the complication here is possible bias in the galaxy sample : if we were to study _ all _ bright galaxies in a volume - limited sample , the  distribution might look very different . to investigate this issue",
    ", we must re - weight the distribution of  in our sample by galaxy type .",
    "the simplest approach is to renormalize by frequency or number density .",
    "we use the 3d  results that 70% , 22% , and 8% of the galaxies in the nearby universe are spirals , lenticulars , and ellipticals ( over a stellar mass range similar to our observational sample ; @xcite ) .",
    "the fractions in our sample are 63% , 14% , and 23% , demonstrating a strong bias toward ellipticals at the expense of lenticulars .",
    "we plot the re - weighted results in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : histdiff ] , showing also for reference a lognormal curve with @xmath138  dex ( a width that will be motivated in section  [ sec : theory2 ] ) .",
    "the total distribution of @xmath139 residuals appears slightly non - gaussian , with a tail extending to low values",
    ". this feature may not be significant if one allows for systematic uncertainties in the selection effects , but the skewness will become clearer when compared to theory in section  [ sec : theory2 ] .",
    "an alternative scheme would be to re - weight by the stellar mass density of the different galaxy types .",
    "this would bring us closer to a total distribution function for stellar @xmath0 in the universe , rather than a distribution of galaxies with given .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to carry out such an exercise in detail , but the basic outcome is clear . the high end of the mass distribution is dominated by early - types ( cf .",
    "lower panel of figure  [ fig : atlas1 ] ) , which means that the mass weighting would enhance the contributions of these galaxies relative to number weighting .",
    "the universal distribution of  would then appear _ more non - gaussian _ than in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : histdiff ] .",
    "we therefore find evidence that the residuals of the specific angular momenta of galaxies from the mean relation are not simply lognormal . the best match to a lognormal model",
    "is provided by the disk components of spirals , while the bulges and the ellipticals may comprise a distinct second population .",
    "again , a natural interpretation of this finding is that all galaxies are composed of some combination of high- and low-  material , which may be identified with disks and bulges , respectively",
    ".    some implications of these results for galaxy formation in a modern cosmological context will be discussed in the next section .",
    "it should be remembered , however , that our empirical findings  of specific , strong correlations between galactic angular momentum , mass , morphology , and bulge fraction  stand on their own and must be explicable by any successful theory of galaxy formation , whether now or in the future .",
    "we are now ready to present a fresh theoretical way of looking at galaxies , using the   diagram , which was introduced in f83 , and which may now be reinvigorated by populating it with observational data for galaxies of all types .",
    "our general approach is to take a step back from galactic _ details _ , whether these be spiral arms and dust lanes in observations , or unresolved gas physics and star formation recipes in simulations , and return to some simple physical parameters and conservation rules that may provide robust constraints and insights to galaxy formation .",
    "we have shown in sections  [ sec : obsresults ] and [ sec : resid ] that the specific stellar angular momenta of observed galaxies follow remarkably tight correlations with their masses and bulge fractions .",
    "such patterns in nature demand theoretical explanations , as they could be tracing fundamental physical processes .",
    "indeed , the   relation for spiral galaxies is well known in some circles , and provides a crucial benchmark for models of galaxy formation . however , the correlation for elliptical galaxies ( already shown in a preliminary version by f83 ) is less well known and addressed with theoretical models .",
    "our goal is to advance a general , physical framework for integrating these observational constraints into models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "our approach here is different from , and complementary to , the active field of hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "although such simulations have made notable progress toward the ultimate goal of reproducing realistic galaxies , they still have a long way to go , with recent work highlighting large differences in the basic properties of simulated galaxies , depending on what code , resolution , and physical recipes are used @xcite .    historically , such methods missed reproducing observed  trends by factors of up to @xmath1  30 , and even the most recent work shows variations at the factor of @xmath1  2 level .",
    "the general concern is that many of the large - scale properties of galaxies could well depend strongly on transport processes at the scales of molecular clouds , which are not yet modeled satisfactorily in cosmological simulations .",
    "therefore some caution is still needed in assuming that the simulations are providing an adequate representation of reality .    in this context ,",
    "simplified `` toy '' models continue to play a key role in defining the broad but solid outlines of the galaxy formation theory that is required to match the observational constraints .",
    "these models may also prove useful in physical understanding of the output of numerical hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "we frame our analysis in the context of the current standard cosmological model for structure formation : cold dark matter with a cosmological constant ( @xmath140cdm ; @xcite ) .",
    "this model makes specific , robust predictions for the angular momenta of dm halos .",
    "because the visible galaxies , consisting of stars and gas , are presumed to reside in these dm halos , we may then ask whether or not the observed stellar angular momenta bear any resemblance to the predictions for dm halos .",
    "we begin with the properties of @xmath140cdm halos as our `` initial conditions '' for galaxy formation , which we map to our observable space :   for the stellar components of galaxies .",
    "we do this by parameterizing the retention of mass and angular momentum during galaxy formation , and then by introducing a menu of   vectors of change that correspond to plausible physical processes ( outflows , mergers , etc . ) .",
    "we emphasize that the primary aim of this paper is _ not _ to concoct a new theory of galaxy formation , nor to weigh in on competing models by vetting specific simulation outputs against the   diagram .",
    "instead , we wish to lay out a generalized framework that can both constrain and explain the models .",
    "the methodology and merits of this approach should become clearer as we develop the ideas throughout this section , and as we eventually work through some practical examples .",
    "we develop general theoretical predictions and make basic inferences about @xmath0 retention in section  [ sec : theory1 ] . in section  [ sec : theory2 ] we investigate two possible explanations for the observed @xmath141 dichotomy between spirals and ellipticals . in section  [ sec : theory3 ]",
    "we consider coupling between changes in mass and angular momentum , and connect these to evolutionary scenarios for galaxies .",
    "the overdense regions in an expanding universe are not spherically symmetric and exert tidal torques on each other , inducing a net angular momentum in each collapsing galaxy @xcite .",
    "this rotational behavior is usually specified in terms of a dimensionless spin parameter that quantifies the dynamical importance of rotation , and is a combination of fundamental physical quantities : @xmath142 where @xmath4 is the angular momentum , @xmath3 is the energy ( kinetic and potential ) , @xmath143 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath2 is the mass @xcite . can be translated roughly into a more observationally oriented basis set of rotation velocity , effective radius , and luminosity @xmath144 , where in approximate terms : @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 . ] whether analyzed through linear tidal torque theory , or through @xmath148-body simulations of galaxy assembly , @xmath8 is predicted to follow an almost lognormal distribution that is relatively insensitive to cosmological parameters , time , galaxy mass , and environment ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the spin parameter provides a convenient way to characterize dm halos , but it is not straightforward to connect @xmath8 to baryonic galaxies because it is not a physically conserved quantity ( as energy is dissipated ) .",
    "we instead conduct our theoretical analysis in terms of the specific angular momentum parameter @xmath0 , as we have done with the observations . along with the mass @xmath2",
    ", @xmath0 is a quantity that is potentially conserved at some approximate level during the evolutionary history of a galaxy .",

    "other recent studies are generally consistent with these results at the level of @xmath1  10% .",
    "the @xmath71 exponent is also an explicit prediction of tidal torque theory @xcite , and provides a reasonable approximation to the trends from _ direct _ calculations of  and  in @xmath148-body simulations @xcite .    equation  ( [ eqn : jlam ] ) can be considered as setting firm `` initial conditions '' for galaxies , characterizing their angular momenta near the time of virialization .",
    "this is shown schematically in panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig : schem2 ] , which we have populated with toy - model `` galaxies '' consisting of primordial halos of gas and dm .",
    "their masses are drawn from a uniform logarithmic distribution , and their angular momenta from a lognormal distribution using @xmath162 and @xmath163 as above .",
    "we next consider a series of idealized evolutionary steps that allow us to parameterize evolution in the @xmath0@xmath2 diagram .",
    "we assume that the baryons consist initially of gas that is well mixed with the dark matter of its parent halo , and that does not collapse within the halo until after the linear and translinear regimes of tidal torque when most of the angular momentum is acquired .",
    "the gas may then be assumed to have the same value of @xmath0 as the halo , which we show in panel ( b ) as a simple shift of the points to the left , according to a cosmological baryon fraction of @xmath164 @xcite .    in panel ( c )",
    "we show what happens in a simple case where a fraction of the baryons form into stars , with a particular value of @xmath165 , and a dispersion of @xmath166  dex .",
    "again , @xmath0 is assumed to be conserved , and the galaxies shift to the left .",
    "it is also usually assumed , though not required by the diagram , that this process involves the formation of a thin stellar disk whose collapse was halted by the balance between gravity and centrifugal force .",
    "our analysis does however assume that the baryon collapse extends all the way out to the halo virial radius .",
    "this conventional assumption is at some level implausible since dm collapse and gas cooling are governed by different physical scales in space and time .",
    "a more generalized approach where the baryon collapse radius is allowed to vary will be considered in section  [ sec : bias ] .",
    "note that the @xmath167 parameter can take on a more general meaning of _ net _ stellar mass fraction relative to initial gas mass , which allows for stars that are accreted by or ejected from the galaxy .",
    "we will shortly discuss a more refined model where @xmath167 varies systematically with mass , but for now we continue with our very simplified constant-@xmath167 model in order to consider its basic implications .",
    "our next model ingredient is an idealized process of angular momentum loss , with no concomitant change in mass , which we quantify by a fractional @xmath0 net retention factor of @xmath168 .",
    "an example of such a process would be internal @xmath0 transfer from the stars to the dm halo",
    ". given the parameters @xmath167 and @xmath168 , we may then translate the @xmath0@xmath2 relation  ( [ eqn : jlam ] ) for dm halos to an equivalent one for the stellar components of galaxies : @xmath169 where again using the prediction for @xmath170 , the numerical coefficient for @xmath171 becomes 1010  kpc .",
    "this relation is identical to our parameterized fit to the observational data with equation  ( [ eqn : loglog ] ) , modulo the numerical factors and the value for the exponent @xmath72 .",
    "since the observed   relation can be approximated with @xmath71 and a normalization @xmath112 , then we can express the difference between observation and theory through a simple combination of the parameters @xmath168 and @xmath167 : @xmath172    equations  ( [ eqn : jlam])([eqn : comb ] ) are simple but powerful , allowing us to connect the visible properties of galaxies to their invisible dm halos , using some simple parameters and assumptions .",
    "they also provide robust observational constraints on some basic characteristics of galaxy formation that are still far beyond the ability of raw theory to predict reliably . _",
    "the average value of @xmath173 for a population of galaxies can be determined by observations as a strict constraint on theory .",
    "_    we can immediately use equation  ( [ eqn : comb ] ) in combination with the observational results for @xmath112 from table  [ tab : loglog ] for fixed @xmath71 .",

    "for example , if we assumed an arbitrary @xmath175  0.2 for both types of galaxies , then we would infer @xmath176  0.65 for spirals and @xmath156  0.1 for ellipticals .",
    "this means a systematic difference in net angular momentum retention between the two galaxy types which , although there are many further details to work through below , will hold up as a basic result of this paper .    to derive firmer constraints on @xmath168",
    ", we need to break the @xmath167@xmath168 degeneracy by introducing well - motivated values for @xmath167 , for both spirals and ellipticals .",
    "we also need to consider the complication that @xmath167 can not in reality have a simple , constant value , even on average .",
    "this is because the observed luminosity function of galaxies has a dramatically different shape from the predicted mass function of dm halos ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "below the characteristic `` knee '' luminosity @xmath47 , the galaxies are observed to follow a shallower slope than the dm mass function @xmath177 , while at higher luminosities , the observations are _ steeper _ than the predictions .",
    "the implication is that the fraction of luminous - to - dark matter declines rapidly for galaxies fainter and brighter than @xmath47 ; i.e. , assuming a constant @xmath96 , the function @xmath178 has a characteristic inverted u shape .",
    "this empirical trend is thought to be caused physically by various feedback effects that inhibit star formation and become increasingly important in the low- and high - mass regimes ( such as stellar and supermassive black hole feedback , respectively ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "regardless of the explanation , any self - consistent @xmath140cdm - based model must incorporate a strong , systematic mass dependence on star formation efficiency , @xmath178 .",
    "one might be concerned that such a mass dependence would transform an underlying @xmath179 relation for dm halos into something very different for the stellar components of galaxies , and quite unlike our observational results .",
    "to check this , we will modify our simple model above to allow for a varying function @xmath180 .",
    "since this function is a tracer of undetermined baryonic physics during galaxy evolution , there is not yet any robust theoretical prediction for it , but fortunately it can be estimated empirically .",
    "this is done in an _ average _ sense through various techniques such as weak gravitational lensing , stacked satellite kinematics , and matching up the mass and luminosity functions mentioned above .",
    "there have been many studies that estimated @xmath178 , but few that did so separately for different galaxy types , which is important for our analysis .",
    "we therefore adopt the relations for @xmath181 derived by @xcite . for the spiral galaxies , we use their relation for `` late - type '' galaxies : @xmath182^{1/2 } } .\\ ] ] below a characteristic mass @xmath183 , this relation has a dependence @xmath184 . at higher masses ,",
    "it approaches a constant , @xmath185 .",
    "here we have converted the dutton  et  al .",
    "results to our definition of the virial mass and to our adopted stellar imf , while using @xmath186 .    for elliptical galaxies ,",
    "we adopt the dutton et al .",
    "relation for `` early - type '' galaxies : @xmath187^{1/2 } } , \\ ] ] where @xmath188 , @xmath189 , and the asymptotic behaviors at low and high masses are @xmath190 and @xmath191 , respectively .",
    "one of the key features to notice here is that an elliptical galaxy typically has a much lower value of @xmath167 than a spiral with the same stellar mass : i.e. , ellipticals inhabit systematically more massive dm halos , which in many cases extend up to `` group '' masses of @xmath192 and beyond ( see also ) .    these @xmath181 relations can be uniquely transformed to @xmath178 , and taken together define an inverted u - shaped trend as discussed above .",
    "the relations were constructed using a compilation of different literature results , which showed an encouraging degree of mutual consistency , so we conclude that the average trends above are probably reliable at the @xmath1  50% ( @xmath1  0.2  dex ) level .",
    "there may also be non - zero galaxy - to - galaxy variations in @xmath167 at a fixed mass and type ; the value of this scatter is less well established , but recent analyses suggest that it may be @xmath1  0.15  dex @xcite . we adopt this as our default value , which fortunately is smaller than the expected dispersion in halo spin of @xmath156  0.23  dex and",
    "so will not have much impact on our conclusions .    using these variable @xmath178 relations to construct mock data sets as before , we plot the results in panels ( d ) and ( e ) of figure  [ fig : schem2 ] .",
    "for both spirals and ellipticals , we can see that the curvature in @xmath193 translates to systematic deviations in the ",
    "relation from a simple @xmath71 power - law .",
    "we will investigate how these deviations compare to real observations in the next subsection .",
    "panels ( d ) and ( e ) of figure  [ fig : schem2 ] also demonstrate that at masses of @xmath194 , the ellipticals are predicted to have _ higher _  than the spirals of the same mass , owing to their differences in @xmath167 .",
    "the more massive dm halos of ellipticals ought to provide larger virial - radius lever arms that lead to larger @xmath195 , and therefore larger _if _ they retain as much fractional angular momentum as spiral galaxies do . therefore the observed offset in   between spirals and ellipticals implies an even larger difference in @xmath196 than in the simple example above with fixed @xmath197 .",
    "we will examine this apparent @xmath168 dichotomy further in the next subsection .    as a final illustrative exercise ,",
    "we generate a mock data set for elliptical galaxies as in panel ( e ) , then adopt @xmath198 , with an assumed dispersion of @xmath199  dex . the results are plotted in panel ( f ) , where we see that the galaxies have coincidentally returned to nearly the original @xmath0@xmath2 sequence for halos , modulo a little curvature and increased scatter .",
    "figure  [ fig : schem2 ] thus shows how one could map the observed",
    "  properties of a population of galaxies ( panel f ) to a theoretical prediction for their halos ( panel a ) , and recover some basic parameters describing galaxy formation ( see equation  ( [ eqn : comb ] ) ) .",
    "this formulation is closely related to a classic theoretical framework for the formation of spiral galaxy disks , whose observed sizes and rotation velocities are generally consistent with the approximate conservation of primordial specific angular momentum ( @xmath200 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , our formulation is more general by including also the early - type galaxies , as well as the bulge components within spiral galaxies ( which we will discuss below ) .",
    "as just discussed , the observed dichotomy between the relations of spirals and ellipticals may imply differences in their specific angular momentum retention , expressed here by the factor @xmath168 .",
    "this interpretation is based on an implicit assumption that the parent halos of both galaxy types had the same average @xmath8 .",
    "however , a natural halo - to - halo scatter in @xmath8 is expected , and one could instead imagine the other extreme case , in which @xmath168 is the same for the two galaxy types , while their halo @xmath8 values are systematically different ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in other words , spirals and ellipticals are drawn from the high- and low - spin tails of the @xmath8 distribution , respectively .",
    "we call these two alternatives the `` variable @xmath168 '' and `` spin bias '' scenarios . in reality",
    ", a mixture of both scenarios may be present , which would be difficult to disentangle , but we can begin by investigating these two limiting cases in detail .",
    "thus the aim of this section is to test how consistent each of these cases is with the data .",
    "the reason we can make headway on this issue is that there are predictions from @xmath140cdm not only for the average value of @xmath8 , but also for its probability distribution , i.e. , a lognormal with a characteristic dispersion as discussed in section  [ sec : theory1 ] .",
    "we continue to focus on the spirals and ellipticals as the two interesting extremes of the observed  range ( at fixed ) , and consider the lenticulars as intermediate either in @xmath168 or in @xmath8 .",
    "we begin with the spin - bias scenario .",
    "if correct , adopting a constant @xmath168 value for a complete , unbiased galaxy sample would allow us to work backwards to infer the underlying @xmath8 distribution , which could then be compared to the theoretical prediction .",
    "one might think that we have already implicitly carried out this test by examining the residuals from the observed ",
    "relation in section  [ sec : hist ] and figure  [ fig : histdiff ] . however , that analysis did not account for the differences in @xmath167 between different galaxy types .",
    "we therefore proceed with a more direct comparison to theory by generating   model predictions for each galaxy type , and calculating the observed residuals with respect to these models .",
    "we use equation  ( [ eqn : jslam ] ) with @xmath201 , along with the empirical @xmath181 relations ( [ eqn : fsmltg ] ) and ( [ eqn : fsmetg ] ) , and an ad - hoc @xmath202 , to predict a mean ",
    "relation for each galaxy type .",
    "we then derive the residuals @xmath203 by subtracting the model from the observations as in equation  ( [ eqn : dj ] ) .",
    "if the spin bias scenario is correct , then the properly reweighted distribution of these residuals ought to follow a lognormal with dispersion @xmath204 ( which accounts for observational errors and the intrinsic scatter in @xmath167 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : histdiff3 ] presents histograms of these residuals , both by separate galaxy types ( top panel ) , and in combination ( bottom panel ) , which uses a renormalization by frequency of galaxy types from the 3d  survey , as in section  [ sec : hist ] , we find that overall , the total distribution of @xmath136 has approximately the predicted width",
    ". however , the distribution in detail appears significantly different from a lognormal : there is an excess of low-@xmath136 galaxies , and a missing tail at high-@xmath136 . in particular , there are too many elliptical galaxies in the nearby universe to be explained by the tail of low - spin halos .",
    "values for spirals and ellipticals that an ad - hoc rescaling of the elliptical values was required in order to avoid a double - peaked @xmath8 distribution . ]",
    "this histogram analysis appears to exclude a simple spin - bias scenario , but there are some caveats , such as small sample sizes and the assumption of perfect lognormality for the distribution of halo spins .",
    "we can make further progress by recognizing that the scenario makes predictions for the  residuals not only for all galaxies combined , but also as a function of mass .",
    "this is because @xmath8 is not predicted to depend on halo mass , while the relative frequencies of different galaxy types are observed to vary strongly .",
    "one can then immediately see a serious problem with the spin - bias scenario : at high masses , almost all of the galaxies are ellipticals , which should thus be an unbiased population representing the full range of halo spins ( @xcite made a similar point for low - mass disk galaxies ) .",
    "we investigate this issue in more detail by constructing a mock data set as in figure  [ fig : schem2 ] , while this time incorporating a schematic model for spin bias .",
    "we now assume that all galaxies have @xmath205 , with the late - types inhabiting the high - spin halos , and the early - types the low - spin ones . using the number densities of early- and late - types as a function of  from 3d",
    ", we use the @xmath181 relations to translate this to the relative fractions at fixed halo mass ( which can be quite different from the fractions at fixed ) .",
    "we then randomly draw a distribution of biased spin parameters for each galaxy type ; e.g. , if spirals comprise 25% of galaxies at a given mass , we draw mock spirals from the top quarter of the spin distribution . we also adopt a similar mass range and total number of galaxies as in our real data sets .",
    "we show the resulting   mock data set in the left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : mock2 ] , which can be compared to the real data in the middle panel .",
    "we see that the low - mass ellipticals could indeed be drawn from only the low - spin tail because of their rarity .",
    "however , at high masses the ellipticals are common and their predicted  values are similar to the spirals",
    ". to salvage the spin - bias scenario would thus seem to require a mass - dependent bias , which seems epicyclic and therefore not appealing .",
    "the biasing idea can also be discredited by environmental considerations : there are strong observational correlations between environmental density and galaxy morphology , but as mentioned earlier , halo spins in theory depend only weakly on environment ( which has some observational support in the case of disk galaxies ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , if we consider disks and bulges to be manifestations of the same   trends as spiral and elliptical galaxies , then the coexistence of these subcomponents within the same galaxies provides a clear argument against halo spin bias .",
    "we next turn to the variable-@xmath168 scenario , where spirals and ellipticals are drawn from the same underlying distribution of halo spins , but their baryonic components have systematic differences in retaining @xmath0 .",
    "given that we know @xmath206 for each galaxy type , equation  ( [ eqn : comb ] ) suggests that we can immediately use the observed @xmath112 normalization to infer @xmath196 .",
    "however , the situation is more complicated since @xmath206 varies with mass and therefore one does not expect an exact @xmath71 for fixed @xmath168 ( recall figure  [ fig : schem2](d , e ) ) .    as we did for the spin - bias scenario , we again construct mean relations for each galaxy type , while now leaving @xmath168 as a free parameter . carrying out least - square fits to the data",
    ", we find values of @xmath207 and @xmath208 for the spiral and elliptical galaxies , respectively .",
    "the difference in @xmath196 of a factor of @xmath209 is slightly larger than the observed ",

    "@xmath167 , in principle the inferred @xmath168 dichotomy could be an artifact of errors in our adopted values for @xmath206 . however , these errors would have to amount to a combined factor of @xmath1  5 : e.g. , with true @xmath210  0.1 for the spirals along with @xmath1  0.2 for the ellipticals , rather than @xmath1  0.25 and @xmath1  0.1 . ]",
    "the next step is to verify that these best - fit models provide reasonable representations of the data .",
    "we again construct mock data sets , using the new @xmath168 models ( with 0.15  dex of scatter in @xmath167 ) , and show the results in the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : mock2 ] . here",
    "we see that , unlike the spin bias model , these variable-@xmath168 models provide a remarkably good match to the data .",
    "the curvature of the predicted relation turns out to be imperceptible , once we account for observational errors , small - number statistics , and a limited mass range",
    ". scenarios .",
    "given the observational difficulty of measuring  at high masses where the underlying halos pertain to entire galaxy groups and clusters , the best prospect for improvement would be to study lower - mass galaxies , with @xmath211  9 .",
    "] furthermore , the observed slope for the spirals is shallower than @xmath71 , which is predicted by the model .",
    "this comparison does not entirely succeed in accounting for the _ scatter _ about the   relations . as can be seen in figure  [ fig : mock2 ]",
    ", the real observations appear to follow _ tighter _ trends than predicted by our simple model , for both spirals and ellipticals .",
    "the model fits give rms scatters of @xmath212  0.18  dex and 0.25  dex for the spirals and ellipticals , which is already _ less _ than the expected scatter of 0.27  dex from @xmath8 and @xmath167 , even without allowing for measurement errors , and scatter in @xmath168 ( see also the histogram of spirals in the top panel of figure  [ fig : histdiff3 ] , compared to the curve in the lower panel ) .",
    "one possible explanation for this reduced scatter is that the baryonic processes responsible for @xmath0-loss could act as some kind of `` attractor '' to specific values of @xmath168 ( cf .",
    "alternatively , halo spin bias could be at work in a secondary role , even while @xmath168 variation is the primary effect .",
    "dichotomy between spirals and ellipticals would be even larger than in our no - bias scenario . ]",
    "our overall conclusion is that the variable-@xmath168 model reproduces the ",

    "the spirals appear to have been fairly efficient in preserving the specific angular momentum imprints of their parent halos , while ellipticals have lost the vast majority of theirs .",
    "this is a plausible scenario from a physical standpoint if we return to our proposed framework where all galaxies are composed of bulges and disks ( figure  [ fig : schem1 ] and section  [ sec : replace ] ) .",

    "however , the observations are somewhat suggestive of the _ opposite _ trend , i.e. , disk  anti - correlating with @xmath13 . ]",
    "we will return to this topic in the next section .    our conclusions about _ spiral",
    "_ galaxies echo similar findings in the literature , which have typically inferred @xmath214  0.50.6 overall ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , @xcite used a model parametrization similar to our @xmath215 , and found that @xmath196 is fairly constant over a wide mass range . note that these authors used a parametrized mass model to fit the tully - fisher relation , which was then converted to an average @xmath195@xmath216 relation .",

    "in addition , there may be two subpopulations of lenticulars as discussed in section  [ sec : resid ] , with low and high @xmath196 .",
    "there are two interesting implications about these findings .",
    "one is that that we now have a remarkably simple and successful framework for describing and connecting some of the most fundamental properties of galaxies .",
    "the observable galaxies may be connected to their unobservable host halos using  and  along with some relatively basic parameters @xmath168 and @xmath167 .",
    "such a model may appear implausibly oversimplified in the light of our ever - expanding awareness of the complexities of galaxy formation physics , but for some reason it seems to work .",
    "the other implication is that these parameters may give us insight into the formation of disks and bulges , and into the origins of the hubble sequence . to illustrate this point",
    ", we use our modeling procedures as described above to work backwards and estimate @xmath167 and @xmath168 values for _ individual _ galaxies .",
    "the outcome is shown in figure  [ fig : fvsf ] , where one should focus on the _ average _ results for each galaxy type , since no attempt was made to model the scatter in @xmath167 and @xmath8 .",
    "the general picture that we obtain is that spiral and elliptical galaxies are clumped around two regions of parameter space : @xmath221 , and @xmath222 , respectively . _",
    "whatever processes formed and shaped these galaxies were efficient at both forming stars and retaining total specific angular momentum for the spirals , and inefficient for the ellipticals . _    as discussed in section  [ sec : intro ] , early cosmologically - based simulations struggled to reproduce such high @xmath168 values for spirals , finding typically @xmath223  0.010.1 , which was later realized to be due in part to numerical artifacts , and in part to inadequate feedback recipes .",
    "feedback could be particularly important for slowing down gas collapse and star formation so that the baryons are not affected by torque - driven @xmath0 transfer during early mergers @xcite .",
    "however , whatever physical processes are now invoked to explain the @xmath168 values of spirals must simultaneously allow for much lower @xmath168 in ellipticals ( e.g. , by having less efficient feedback ; @xcite ) .",
    "now that we have derived a comprehensive framework for connecting   observations with simulated @xmath140cdm halos , and thereby derived generic constraints on specific angular momentum retention , @xmath168 ( figure  [ fig : fvsf ] ) , we will work through some case studies of plausible physical processes in galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "these cases are not meant to be exhaustive , nor to provide immediate ammunition for current debates about galaxy formation , but to serve as practical examples of how the @xmath0@xmath2 diagram can be used as a tool to furnish physical insight .",
    "the models involved will treat @xmath168 and @xmath167 as covariant parameters , unlike in the previous sections where for simplicity they were independent .",
    "a general constraint to keep in mind is that for each galaxy type , @xmath168 is approximately constant as a function of mass , including little additional scatter , which accounts for the observed @xmath0@xmath2 relations appearing so similar to those for theoretical dm halos . _ any model for angular momentum evolution",
    "should explain why galaxies appear to remember so faithfully the overall initial conditions of their parent halos .",
    "_    the challenge of this @xmath168 constancy has been recognized previously for disk galaxies .",
    "there are a variety of physical mechanisms during galaxy evolution that could involve @xmath0 transfer ( e.g. , gas cooling and feedback ) , but unlike gravitational clustering , these baryonic processes ( and the resulting @xmath168 values ) are expected to depend strongly on mass , which appears to require some degree of fine - tuning to reconcile with the observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our inclusion of early - type galaxies in this framework , with near - constant @xmath168 , deepens the mystery : there are now _ two _ fine - tuning conspiracies to explain .    here",

    "the local specific angular momentum within the disk , @xmath225 , is assumed to increase monotonically with galactocentric radius , which is unavoidable if the gas follows co - rotating circular orbits ( the rotation - velocity profile can not decrease any more rapidly than keplerian , while the lever arm @xmath21 in the @xmath0 calculation increases linearly ) .    before many stars form , an outflow begins which we parameterize by a mass loss that is proportional to the gas surface density to some unknown power @xmath226 : @xmath227 because the gas is presumed to settle into a configuration where the density increases toward the center ( e.g. , an exponential profile ) , the parameter @xmath226 translates into a biased removal of gas from different disk _ radii _ , which in turn means depletion of gas parcels with systematically different @xmath228 .    to analyze this scenario further , we now introduce figure  [ fig : schem3 ] , which like figure  [ fig : schem2 ] illustrates schematic vectors of mass and angular momentum evolution , but now extends to more specific , physically - motivated processes . in figure",
    "[ fig : schem3](a ) , the horizontal arrow to the left illustrates an outflow with @xmath229 : the gas everywhere in the disk is depleted by an equal fraction , and its initial specific angular momentum is preserved , while its mass decreases . if @xmath230 , then the outflows occur preferentially in the high - density , central regions that have relatively low @xmath228 , and so the overall @xmath228 for the galaxy increases ( diagonal arrow toward upper left ; cf .",
    "if @xmath231 , then the mass loss is preferentially from the outer regions , and the overall @xmath228 decreases ( diagonal arrows toward lower left ) .",
    "thus , outflows could in principle produce either a net increase or decrease in @xmath168 .",
    "it should be kept in mind that these outflows represent only material that is launched completely out of the galaxy , never to return .",
    "other types of outflows may also occur , where gas is expelled outward but remains bound and falls inward again , as in a galactic fountain ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , such internal processes might alter only the detailed distribution with radius of @xmath0 , and not affect the overall value which concerns us here ( see the discussion above of weak and strong @xmath0 conservation ) .",
    "more complex scenarios could also be considered , where fountain material interacts with halo gas and exchanges angular momentum ( e.g. , @xcite ) , leading to shifts in  for the stellar disk that eventually forms .",
    "a mechanism related to gas outflows is galaxy _ stripping _ through gravitational interactions with other galaxies in a dense environment . here the effects on  and  depend on whether the tidal stripping occurs before or after the gas collapses . if a galactic halo is tidally stripped _ before _ the gas collapses ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "then the reservoir of @xmath232 and @xmath228 available for collapse is depleted in a manner that depends on the internal distribution of these quantities .",
    "f83 adopted some plausible distributions and worked out the resulting @xmath0@xmath2 changes : we will not repeat the analysis here , but merely show the equivalent evolutionary vectors as the three arrows in figure  [ fig : schem3](a ) pointing downwards to the left .",
    "there are two key features to notice with the gaseous stripping arrows .",
    "one is that unlike outflows , this stripping can only _ decrease _ @xmath168 ( @xmath231 ) since it acts solely on the outer regions .",
    "the second is that plausible @xmath0-loss vectors are accompanied by substantial mass loss , which means that it is fairly difficult to move galaxies away from the initial @xmath0@xmath2 sequence .",
    "this conclusion is supported by @xmath148-body simulations of @xmath140cdm halos , which find that the environmental dependencies of halo @xmath8 are fairly weak @xcite .    if instead the stripping occurs _",
    "after _ the gas collapse , then @xmath0 and @xmath2 decrease for the dm but not for the baryons .",
    "this leads to elevated values of @xmath168 and @xmath167 , which could be investigated through observational constraints on @xmath216 for field galaxies in comparison to satellite galaxies in massive groups .",
    "there is another scenario that is functionally equivalent in the @xmath0@xmath2 diagram to outflow or stripping , but which merits special attention .",
    "here we consider a _ spatially - biased _ subcomponent of the initial gas which collapses and forms stars . rather than our default assumption of uniform efficiencies @xmath167 and @xmath168 throughout the virial region",
    ", we assume that stars form preferentially in the _ inner regions _ of the halo , while the outer regions remain largely gaseous and form relatively few stars .",
    "this scenario was introduced by @xcite and is motivated by the higher densities , and thus overall gas dissipation rates ( through cooling and cloud collisions ) , in the inner regions .",
    "the consequent spatial bias in star formation can also be understood as a _ temporal _ bias , if one considers an idealized onion - shell model wherein galaxies form by inside - out collapse , with virialization and star formation occurring first in the central regions ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . even in more realistic , hierarchical galaxy models ,",
    "it is uncontroversial that a large fraction of the baryons within a galaxy halo at any given time will not yet have formed stars , and are located preferentially at larger radii .",
    "the stars observed in a galaxy at @xmath153 will have formed on average at higher redshifts , and from gas that was more centrally confined than the @xmath153 virial volume .",
    "because @xmath0 for a @xmath140cdm halo is expected to increase systematically with both internal radius and time , the above biasing scenario implies that @xmath141 for a galaxy will be lower than its total @xmath0 ( including dm ) .",
    "such a biasing framework was used by @xcite to connect observed disk galaxies with simulated @xmath140cdm halos , and thereby infer a radius of baryonic collapse . here",
    "we outline a generic toy model of collapse bias , to understand its implications in the context of @xmath0@xmath2 evolution vectors .    for simplicity ,",
    "we adopt a step - function model where at an initial redshift @xmath233 , all of the gas within the virial radius instantaneously collapses and forms stars with perfect efficiency and angular momentum conservation ( @xmath234 ) , and subsequently no star formation occurs ( @xmath235 ) .",
    "this scenario is illustrated by figure  [ fig : schem3](b ) , where @xmath233 marks the initial halo parameters .",
    "the leftward arrow shows the formation of the stars , with ",
    "parameters that are preserved until @xmath236 .",
    "the diagonal arrow to the upper - right shows the subsequent evolution of the halo . because the halo continues to grow in @xmath2 and @xmath0 , the net values of @xmath167 and @xmath168 for the stars will decrease with time , which is illustrated by the gray arrows which are the inferences made by connecting the final conditions of the halo and stars .",
    "this biasing scenario might seem to provide a tidy alternative for understanding galaxies that have _ apparently _ experienced baryonic angular momentum loss .",
    "however , it is important to realize that such biasing can not explain just any arbitrary set of   observations . for example , the vectors in figure  [ fig : schem3](b ) were constructed to represent a typical early - type galaxy with a net @xmath237 at @xmath153 , which turns out to have a net @xmath238 , i.e. , not reproducing the apparent @xmath239 from observations .",
    "note that this model had an initial @xmath240 , but in reality , we expect an initial @xmath241 , which would increase the discrepancy",
    ". we will discuss this scenario further in section  [ sec : eval ] ; for now , it serves as an important illustration of how constructing physically - motivated vectors in the ",
    "diagram can provide tight constraints on possible evolutionary scenarios .",
    "we next consider galaxy _ merging _ following star formation , which is likely to be more important for ellipticals than for spirals .",
    "the mass of a galaxy increases through a merger , while its final @xmath0 is determined by the vector sum of three initial @xmath0 components ( the internal @xmath0 for the two progenitor galaxies , and their relative orbital @xmath0 ) , as well as by any exchange of @xmath0 with the environment ( e.g. , between the stars and their surrounding dm halos ) .",
    "the random relative orientations of the first two components will cause them to partially cancel out , which contributes a net _ decrease _ to @xmath0 .",
    "that is , after @xmath148 equal - mass mergers , there will be average trends for the remnant of @xmath242 and @xmath243 , and therefore @xmath244 @xcite .",
    "the orbital @xmath0 and the @xmath0 exchange processes are more difficult to model a priori .    the effects of mergers on dm halos have been studied extensively through numerical simulations , resulting in a general picture where major mergers tend to `` spin up '' the halos , while minor mergers and smooth accretion tend to spin them down ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "given that the @xmath195@xmath216 relation is scale - free and has a normalization that is expected to change only gradually , if at all , with time ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we conclude that for individual halos , the co - addition of the above processes must amount to a random - walk that takes them on average _ along _ the @xmath195@xmath216 sequence .",
    "we illustrate this process in figure  [ fig : schem3](c ) with a schematic evolutionary vector for galaxy halos , broken down into subcomponents of @xmath195 and @xmath216 changes . by a factor of @xmath1  2.3 ; similar effects apply to @xmath195 . ] doubling the mass should typically increase  by a factor of @xmath245 .",
    "the effects of mergers on the stellar components of galaxies , which have collapsed by large factors within their dm halos , are somewhat different . qualitatively speaking , it is a generic dynamical requirement that the stars shed some of their orbital angular momentum , via tidal torques or dynamical friction , in order to coalesce into a bound merger remnant ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "more quantitatively , we may make an initial , plausible guess that the `` final pass '' of the merger before coalescence involves an impact parameter and relative velocity that are similar to the stellar scalelength and circular velocity of the larger progenitor .",
    "this would mean that the smaller progenitor would bring in an orbital @xmath246 of a similar magnitude to internal @xmath247 of the larger progenitor ( i.e. , @xmath248 ) .",
    "we sketch out some implications of this kind of merger evolution in figure  [ fig : schem3](c ) . starting with galaxy disks randomly selected along the median ",
    "trend as in figure  [ fig : schem2](c ) ( adopting a simple @xmath237 model with scatter included for halo @xmath8 ) , we apply a sequence of four mergers to each disk . each merger has a 1:1 mass ratio , and the relative vectors of internal and orbital  are selected randomly ( this is similar in spirit to the orbital - merger model of @xcite ) .",
    "the blue dots show the end result after the merger sequence , and the upper arrow shows the median trend for a single galaxy , with black dots marking the discrete merger events .",
    "note that at this point , the series of four 1:1 events is meant as a thought experiment and not necessarily as a likely merger history .",
    "after an initial decrease of  in the first merger from cancellation of the internal spin vectors , the orbital  dominates the evolution of the merger remnant ( e.g. , @xcite ; this also means that the results hardly change if the `` accreted '' galaxies are low-  spheroids rather than disks as we have assumed here ) . because the orbital  term is assumed to be similar to the disk ",
    "trend , the final trend for the merger remnants parallels the disk trend , while being offset to lower  by a factor of @xmath1  2 ( @xmath1  @xmath249  dex ) . referring back",
    "to figure  [ fig : schem2 ] , this corresponds to an effective angular momentum loss term of @xmath250 .",
    "the distribution of the offset is also shown by a histogram in figure  [ fig : histdiff2 ] .",
    "we have carried out the same exercise for a series of 1:10 mergers , with a median trend shown by the lower vector in figure  [ fig : schem3](c ) .",
    "the result is similar to the 1:1 case , with orbital  dominating the evolution after the galaxy grows in mass by a factor of @xmath1  2 .",
    "however , the final  trend is now lower than the disks by a factor of @xmath1  6 ( @xmath1  @xmath251  dex ; @xmath223  0.15 ) , with less scatter than in the 1:1 case ( see figure  [ fig : histdiff2 ] again ) .",
    "these differences arise because there is less stochasticity with the 1:10 mergers , where random walk effects tend both to wash out variations and to dilute the orbital contributions to .",
    "a more realistic mixture of multiple mergers with varying mass ratios would presumably produce a  distribution with a peak intermediate to our 1:1 and 1:10 scenarios , and with a larger scatter .",
    "these calculations are laden with simplifying assumptions and could easily be wrong by a factor of 2 in",
    ". however , they are meant to illustrate some possible implications of merger activity in a hierarchical context .",
    "first of all , it is plausible that spheroids with a merger origin would follow a ",
    "relation that is parallel to that of spiral disks , but offset to lower  by a factor of a few.cdm halos , but is incorrect at some level for stellar galaxies , owing to the strong break in their luminosity function . ]",
    "second , the scatter in  introduced by random merging may be relatively small .",
    "these two results in our toy model are both driven by the dominant contributions of orbital .",
    "similar points were made by @xcite and by @xcite , in the latter case based on the prediction that @xmath8 would be fairly constant with radius inside dm halos .",
    "the stars that condense at the center of a halo , and then participate collisionlessly in its merger history , would naturally follow the same @xmath0@xmath2 scaling relations as the overall halos , modulo a smaller scale - length in converting from @xmath8 to @xmath0 ( in equation  ( [ eqn : lambda ] ) , @xmath252 is inversely proportional to the radius ) .",
    "we now step back and consider how well the preceding evolutionary scenarios ( outflows , stripping , collapse bias , and mergers ) mesh with the observational constraints ( figures  [ fig : jmm0 ] and [ fig : fvsf ] ) .",
    "the idea is to find a vector ( or combination of vectors ) that connects up the well - established endpoints in the @xmath0@xmath2 diagram : the @xmath140cdm halo initial conditions and the @xmath153 galaxy observations .",
    "it should however be remembered that the focus of this paper is not to solve long - standing questions about galaxy evolution which may require a detailed understanding of the physics involved . instead , our more modest goals are to illustrate how the @xmath0@xmath2 diagram can be used in practical terms as a constraint on theory , while looking for any hints as to the viability of various scenarios .",
    "recent work in numerical simulations of _ disk _ galaxy formation has emphasized how outflows might remove low-@xmath228 material , which counteracts @xmath0-loss through tidal torques during galaxy collapse , and maintains a high net level of @xmath168 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we could then imagine that the differences between spiral and elliptical galaxies originate from the spirals having much stronger outflows at early times .",
    "this outflow scenario implies more mass loss in spirals and so would initially seem to work the wrong way in explaining the @xmath167 differences  but there could be other factors besides gas - depletion that affect @xmath167 .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to explore this scenario in detail , but we emphasize that the focus on reproducing @xmath168 and @xmath167 for spirals needs to expand to include simultaneously the constraints from ellipticals , beyond these being nuisance factors that represent failed disks .    we have already discussed how stripping before baryonic collapse is not expected to produce large changes in the observable   relations , which may indeed be part of the reason that there is not more scatter in these relations . , and is discussed in @xcite .",
    "this `` compact elliptical '' is a fairly rare type of galaxy .",
    "] there is also a more obvious constraint that both spirals and ellipticals exist in the field and in clusters , so present - day environment can not be the unique driver of morphology and @xmath0 evolution .",
    "collapse bias is an appealing possibility because it would provide a natural explanation for the positive correlation between @xmath167 and @xmath168 as in figure  [ fig : fvsf ] . in this scenario",
    ", elliptical galaxies would cease to build up both  and at relatively early times , with the remaining baryonic @xmath2 and @xmath0 at late times either residing in a hot gas halo or having been blown out into intergalactic space .",
    "spiral galaxies would have more protracted star formation histories that increase  and  monotonically with time .    besides explaining the relative positions of ellipticals and spirals in the diagram , this scenario also fits in naturally with the observation that the stars in spirals are on average much younger than those in ellipticals .",
    "there may be additional implications if one connects the _ baryon _ collapse to the _ overall halo _ collapse , which has a well - understood theoretical underpinning . at a given @xmath153 mass ,",
    "some halos should have collapsed earlier than others , leading to their dm distributions being more centrally concentrated . given a fixed @xmath8 , the central dm and associated stars would then have relatively low @xmath0 values . since halo collapse time is correlated strongly with environmental density",
    ", one would then expect the low-  galaxies to reside preferentially in high - density environments  which is indeed what is found observationally ( through the traditional morphology - density relation ) .",
    "a potential problem with this scenario is that it does not appear by itself to be capable of explaining the apparent deficit of  in ellipticals , as discussed in section  [ sec : bias ] .",
    "more detailed analysis would be needed to see if halo concentration makes a difference , and to understand the baryonic physics of why early - collapsing galaxies would also shut down their star formation more drastically than late collapsers .",
    "in addition to collapse bias , other effects may also need to be involved , such as a bias to low spin for their halos , or a component of real @xmath0 loss .",
    "the merger scenario is a common explanation for ellipticals , since it accounts for spheroidal morphologies through violent relaxation @xcite , and because there is strong observational evidence for some elliptical galaxies actively forming through mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our toy model analysis suggests that the overall effect of mergers is to _ reduce _ the  of the remnant relative to an initial ",
    "trend for disks , while the combination of _ multiple _ mergers may move the remnants parallel to that trend ( figure  [ fig : schem3](c ) ) .",
    "this might provide a natural explanation for the observed ",
    "trend for ellipticals : the slope , scatter , and offset relative to disks .",
    "note that it is not entirely clear in this context why the spiral bulges and the ellipticals would follow the same   trends .",
    "a more quantitative comparison of our model to the observations allows us not only to constrain the typical mass ratios in mergers ( as figure  [ fig : histdiff2 ] ) , but also to infer the amount of mass growth in ellipticals since their assumed primordial disk phase .",
    "we do so by mapping our toy model vectors for mergers in the key @xmath168@xmath167 diagram ( figure  [ fig : fvsf ] ) , starting from initial conditions similar to present - day spirals ( @xmath253 ) , and requiring that they terminate at @xmath254 ) .    recalling that @xmath216 growth slightly outpaces  growth we find that reducing @xmath167 by a factor of 2.5 requires a very long series of mergers , with a final growth factor of @xmath1  100 in  and @xmath1  300 in @xmath216 .",
    "consideration of the @xmath168 constraint then suggests a typical merger mass ratio of @xmath1  1:3 .",
    "such `` major mergers '' seem like a reasonable pathway to forming elliptical galaxies , although recent work suggests a more dominant role for _ minor _ mergers ( e.g. , @xmath1  1:10 ; @xcite ) , which is motivated in part by explaining trends in size evolution , and is also supported by the observed _ shapes _ of rotation - velocity profiles ( see section  [ sec : obsresults ] and @xcite ) . )",
    "are often thought to originate in different merger histories , such as binary versus multiple mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our discussion concerns primarily the fast - rotators , since these represent the vast majority of ellipticals , and in addition , our  constraints for the slow - rotators are less certain .",
    "however , as discussed in sections  [ sec : obsresults ] and [ sec : replace ] , we detect no systematic difference in   space between the two galaxy types , suggesting that they may have relatively similar merger histories after all . ]",
    "this apparent tension is not of great concern since our current results involve significant observational uncertainties and a crude model for the merging vectors in figure  [ fig : schem3](c ) , while not taking proper account of the redshift - dependence of virial quantities .",
    "however , they are intended to illustrate conceptually the kinds of constraints that are possible with more careful modeling .",
    "a merger scenario may successfully explain the ",
    "properties of ellipticals , but it should be remembered that in a cosmological context , all galaxies including spirals should experience a continuous rain of accreting objects . even if spiral galaxies have systematically avoided the most extreme merger events , they will have still experienced events in the @xmath1  1:10 range ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which as shown in our toy models could significantly reduce . a more detailed analysis of   evolution within a cosmological framework is needed in order to investigate the quantitative differences that might arise between spirals and ellipticals owing to varying merger histories .",
    "in particular , an explanation for the observed bulge  disk  bimodality is needed , since a spectrum of merger histories is more suggestive of a smooth distribution of .",
    "it should also be kept in mind that @xmath255 is observationally constrained not only for present - day galaxies , but also at earlier times ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which introduces additional `` boundary conditions '' to @xmath0@xmath2 evolution .    synthesizing the scenarios above",
    ", it seems plausible that ellipticals might be explained through a combination of collapse bias and multiple mergers  which bears a notable resemblance to recent discussions of two - phase galaxy formation @xcite . in this context ,",
    "an early burst of star formation would both imprint a relatively low initial , and allow more opportunity for subsequent mergers to reduce  further .",
    "spirals would be those systems where late gas infall both brings in higher @xmath0 , and avoids the most active merging period .",
    "there are of course other considerations besides angular momentum when constructing models of galaxy evolution , which are beyond the scope of this paper to evaluate .",
    "we have also been able to cover only a subset of possible scenarios .",
    "one significant omission is the disk - instability pathway for bulge formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is an internal process where the bulge and disk either form from high- and low-@xmath0 material , or else exchange @xmath0 through gravitational torques .",
    "while this pathway is usually considered in connection with pseudo - bulges , there are recent proposals that the special conditions in high - redshift galaxy disks can lead to the massive , classical bulges of present - day spirals , lenticulars , and ellipticals ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the filamentary nature of mass and @xmath0 inflows at high redshift may also require significant revisions to standard spherical models @xcite .",
    "our overarching emphasis here is that whatever the mechanisms for galaxy formation , they must reproduce the basic   scaling relations _ observed for both spiral and elliptical galaxies_. a combination of all the processes mentioned above , and more , could be operational in real galaxies , where each process must be associated with a vector of ",
    "evolution that is not arbitrary but physically - motivated , as we have sketched in figures  [ fig : fvsf ] and [ fig : schem2 ] .",
    "the sum of these vectors over the lifetime of the galaxy must preserve the halo - like scaling relations , _ along with a relatively small scatter_. these may be very challenging constraints to match in practice , particularly if one includes boundary conditions on @xmath256 evolution with redshift , and requires that the   relations hold for both bulge and disk components simultaneously within the same galaxies .    thus , a fresh approach to @xmath0@xmath2 analysis appears to hold promise for providing new , powerful constraints on galaxy evolution .",
    "we would encourage numerical simulators to keep this approach in mind as part of their toolkit , tracking the evolution of their simulated galaxies in the @xmath0@xmath2 diagram , while refining our schematic estimates of @xmath257@xmath258 vectors , and thereby gaining more insights into the underlying physical processes in the simulations .",
    "we have revisited the pioneering study of f83 which derived observational estimates for the fundamental quantities  and  ( stellar mass and specific angular momentum ) of spiral and elliptical galaxies , and compared these to theoretical expectations based on hierarchical assembly .",
    "although the amount and distribution of  in late - type galaxies has been an intensively - studied topic in the intervening years , even the most basic trends for early - types have not been satisfactorily established .",
    "we have capitalized on the advent of radially - extended kinematic data for a large sample of early - type galaxies , to update and extend the analyses of f83 .",
    "we focus first on detailed analysis of a small sample of galaxies with data extending to typically five effective radii , which is the distance one must reach for a high degree of confidence in the  estimates .",

    ", we also introduce an important new observational scaling relation for galaxies of all types : @xmath75 versus .",
    "this relation is analogous to the well - known tully - fisher relation for disk galaxies , but is more closely related to angular momentum than to dynamical mass . unlike the generalized tully - fisher relation , the mass ",
    "rotation  velocity relation shows _ near - perpendicular _ rather than parallel trends for spiral and elliptical galaxies .",
    "these rotation - velocity trends combine with size  mass trends to trace the more fundamental   trends .",

    "although this conclusion has already been used in some theoretical analyses , now it has a much firmer observational basis .",
    "in particular , the data do not support previous suggestions that major mergers have transported large amounts of angular momentum into the outer regions of ellipticals .",
    "we confirm for the first time that lenticular galaxies on average lie intermediate to ellipticals and late - type spirals in the   plane , with tentative indications for two families of lenticulars characterized by low and high .",
    "we see no indication of systematic , overall differences between centrally fast- and slow - rotator ellipticals .",
    "we also find that spiral bulges are consistent with following the   sequence for ellipticals , despite having very different relations between mass , size , and rotation .",
    "thus , as far as the fundamental parameters  and  are concerned , spiral bulges are essentially like mini - ellipticals .",
    "we examine the residuals of the combined galaxy   data with respect to the disk - only trend , and find that these correlate better with disk - to - bulge ratio than with hubble type .",
    "they also deviate from a lognormal distribution , possibly suggesting instead a bimodality in . considering all of these results together , we propose an alternative framework to the hubble sequence , based on more physically motivated parameters . in this picture , all galaxies are a combination of a bulge and a disk , which are distinct subcomponents with different characteristic amounts of .",
    "galaxy morphology may then be seen as a secondary manifestation of the mix of high- and low-@xmath0 material , or equivalently , the position of a galaxy in   parameter space is a reflection of its bulge - to - disk ratio .",
    "we next connect our observational results to a theoretical framework based on the hierarchical assembly of galaxy halos in a @xmath140cdm cosmology .",
    "we use numerically - informed analytic methods that are much simpler than hydrodynamical simulations , but less susceptible to the large , lingering uncertainties about baryonic recipes , resolution effects , and other numerical issues .",

    "the zeropoint differences among these relations provide valuable clues to the formation processes of different galaxy types .",
    "mapping between halo and stellar quantities involves two basic parameters : the net fraction of baryons turned into stars , @xmath167 , and the fraction of specific @xmath0 retained , @xmath168 .",

    "this is an unavoidable conclusion from basic comparisons between observational constraints and theoretical expectations , which for many years presented a major challenge to numerical simulations of galaxy formation , as these apparently predicted very low values for @xmath168 .",
    "it has gradually been realized that such simulations overpredicted angular momentum transport ( e.g. , @xcite ) , with major uncertainties still lingering in the baryonic physics included in the simulations .",
    "our consolidation of the @xmath168 result for elliptical galaxies provides a new benchmark for models of galaxy evolution , which to be fully credible must reproduce the observed @xmath168 ( and @xmath167 ) trends for both spirals and ellipticals _ in the same simulation_. for example , any feedback processes that are invoked to prevent overcooling and @xmath0 loss in spirals should be much less effective for ellipticals .",
    "we have explored a few toy models for galaxy evolution that exploit the basic constraints provided by the parameter space of  and , or equivalently of @xmath168 and @xmath167 .",
    "galaxies can not evolve arbitrarily in this parameter space , requiring physically - motivated diagonal vectors of change ( @xmath262 ) .",
    "thus we suggest the @xmath0@xmath2 diagram as a key tool for assessing and interpreting any model of galaxy formation .",
    "our simplified models suggest that a combination of early baryonic collapse and repeated galaxy merging ( major or minor ) might account for the parallel - but - offset trend of ellipticals relative to spirals .",
    "we have provided illustrative constraints on the numbers and mass - ratios of the mergers , which after refinement with more detailed modeling could be compared with cosmologically - based predictions for mass growth and merging .    in summary",
    ", we have established a new synthesis of ",
    "trends from observations , whose general resemblance to halos in @xmath140cdm cosmology provides important support for that theory , and in turn furnishes a valuable framework for constraining baryonic processes as discussed above .",
    "our course , the observations presented here must be relevant to any model of galaxy formation , even if @xmath140cdm theory eventually needs revision .",
    "more generally , we propose that the morphologies of galaxies are closely tied to the evolution of angular momentum during their assembly , with late - types being very efficient at retaining @xmath0 , and early - types proficient at shedding @xmath0 .    in this context , there are several areas ripe for additional progress .",
    "first , clear predictions from high - resolution cosmological simulations are needed for  versus  as a function of galaxy type , to explore whether the dichotomy between spirals and ellipticals , or disks and bulges , can be explained by differences in their assembly histories .",
    "second , the observational work on nearby galaxies should be extended to the next level , via a volume - limited , homogeneous survey of all types of galaxies including full two - dimensional , wide - field photometric - kinematic bulge  disk decompositions , with attention to stellar mass - to - light ratio variations .",
    "this would allow for more robust analysis of the deviations of the  residuals from lognormality , and for more secure treatments of s0/sa galaxies and of bulge and disk subcomponents .",
    "third , the extensions of our study to lower - mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) as well as to higher - redshift galaxies ( cf .  ) , to freshly accreted material within galaxies ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and to the orientations of the @xmath263 vectors ( e.g. , @xcite ) , would provide additional , valuable diagnostics .",

    "we begin with the description of a galaxy as the six - dimensional phase - space distribution function of its particles ( gas and stars ) @xmath264 , where * r * and * v * are the ( vector ) position and velocity coordinates relative to the galactic center , and @xmath265 is normalized to unity when integrated over all positions and velocities . given a total mass @xmath2 , the three - dimensional spatial mass density at position * r * is @xmath266 and the mean velocity at that position is @xmath267 the true ( i.e. , not projected ) specific angular momentum is then @xmath268    given the loss of information in observed galaxies ( one positional dimension lost in projection , and two velocity dimensions usually unmeasurable as proper motions ) , one must adopt some simplifying assumptions in order to recover @xmath24 from observations .",
    "our main assumptions here are that galaxies are transparent , have _ axisymmetric _",
    "density distributions , and _",
    "rotate on cylinders _ that are aligned with the symmetry axis of the density ( with no other net velocity component such as expansion or contraction ) .",
    "adopting cylindrical galactic coordinates @xmath269 , our modeling assumptions imply that @xmath16 becomes a simple rotation - velocity profile @xmath270 , independent of @xmath271 and @xmath272 ( where @xmath273 is the unit vector in the azimuthal direction ) , and that the density @xmath274 is independent of @xmath272 .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : a4 ] ) then reduces to a one - dimensional integral : @xmath275 where @xmath276 is the surface mass density when the galaxy is viewed pole - on . with these assumptions ,",
    "all galaxies with the same @xmath277 rotational profile and the same pole - on @xmath278 have the same @xmath24 , e.g. , whether they are thin disks or round spheroids .    even under these fairly restrictive assumptions , recovering the true angular momentum of an observed galaxy",
    "is a difficult inverse problem .",
    "fortunately , there is a way to structure the problem that makes it conceptually and computationally simpler .",
    "we separate the calculation for  into two factors : @xmath279 here the second factor on the right is the analogue of equation  ( [ eqn : a5 ] ) constructed _ purely from observations _ along the projected semi - major axis @xmath26 : @xmath280 note that this `` projected specific angular momentum '' is _ not _ literally the projection of @xmath281 on the plane of the sky ( which we will discuss at the end of this subsection ) .",
    "also , the two denominators in equations  ( [ eqn : a5 ] ) and ( [ eqn : jest ] ) are closely related . in the case of spherical symmetry for the density",
    ", they are identical , and for now we will adopt this assumption for simplicity , returning to the more general axisymmetric case later .",
    "the first factor in equation ( [ eqn : jcp ] ) , @xmath28 , is a numerical coefficient incorporating all of the additional deprojection effects that depend on inclination and on the shapes ( but not the amplitudes ) of the surface density profile and of the rotation - velocity curve .",
    "substituting equations  ( [ eqn : a5 ] ) and ( [ eqn : jest ] ) into equation  ( [ eqn : jcp ] ) , we have @xmath282    before manipulating equation  ( [ eqn : cj0 ] ) further , we point out that the advantage of this formulation of the angular momentum problem is that the complicated expression @xmath28 need not be evaluated for every individual galaxy  provided that it is not sensitive to the details of the density and rotation - velocity profiles , and instead depends primarily on the inclination . using simple models below , we will verify that this is the case , so that we can treat @xmath28 as a numerical coefficient ( calibrated by models ) that we combine with the observables in equation  ( [ eqn : jest ] ) , and thereby reconstruct  using equation  ( [ eqn : jcp ] ) .",
    "next , to derive a more specific expression for @xmath28 , we begin by considering a galaxy observed from an arbitrary direction , which we characterize by the usual inclination @xmath30 , the angle between the rotation axis @xmath271 and the line - of - sight . the observer s reference frame is ( @xmath283 ) , where @xmath284 is the line - of - sight ( measured away from the observer ) , and @xmath285 is aligned with @xmath26 for convenience ( see figure  [ fig : coords ] ) . since we are adopting an approach of modeling rotation - velocity profiles along the observed semi - major axis , we simplify the problem by doing calculations only for the case @xmath286 .",
    "the coordinate transformations between galaxy and observer frames are then @xmath287 @xmath288 @xmath289 ( see @xcite for more general expressions ) . the azimuthal unit vector in the galaxy frame can be expressed as @xmath290 which after using unit - vector relations analogous to equations  ( [ eqn : xx ] ) and ( [ eqn : yy ] ) , becomes @xmath291    for a given parcel of material , the observer can measure only the projection of the mean velocity vector onto the line - of - sight , which we express as a dot product : @xmath292 from equation  ( [ eqn : phip ] ) , we then find @xmath293 where we use equations  ( [ eqn : xx ] ) and ( [ eqn : yy ] ) to make the substitution @xmath294 .",
    "we thus define a projected profile of rotation velocity along the semi - major axis : @xmath295 which we calculate by integrating equation  ( [ eqn : vp2 ] ) along the line - of - sight @xmath284 while weighting by the density @xmath17 . recalling also that for now",
    ", we are assuming spherical symmetry for the density , we find the projected rotation - velocity profile @xmath296 where we can also substitute @xmath297 .",
    "the denominator is the surface density [ equation  ( [ eqn : sigma ] ) ] , and we have @xmath298    there are a couple of notable features about equations  ( [ eqn : vp2 ] ) and ( [ eqn : vrotp1 ] ) .",
    "one is that the difference between true and observed rotation velocity is more than a simple matter of the `` @xmath299 '' inclination effect for a galaxy tilted away from edge - on . for a system of finite thickness",
    ", there is an additional @xmath300 term that represents a `` dilution '' effect ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , corresponding to the projection of a circular orbit seen at varying azimuth @xmath272 ( see figure  [ fig : coords ] ) . even for an edge - on case , the rotation vector is not in the line - of - sight except at the tangent point for a given semi - major axis distance @xmath26 .",
    "this effect also implies that even if the true rotation velocity ( @xmath301 ) is constant with radius , the projected rotation velocity ( @xmath302 ) is generally _ not _ , and goes to zero toward the center of the galaxy ( see left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : cr ] for examples ) .",
    "next , using equation  ( [ eqn : vrotp1 ] ) , we find our final value for the numerical coefficient , @xmath303 where @xmath304 can in principle also be written in terms of the directly observed profile @xmath27 via an abel integral .",
    "having arrived at our general expressions for calculating , we note that there is another , related approach found in the literature .",
    "this is to construct an observational analogue to @xmath24 , using the data directly to calculate a two - dimensional cross - product in an expression similar to ( [ eqn : a4 ] ) @xcite .",
    "this technique has the merit of potentially providing a general characterization of the data , including non - axisymmetric rotation fields .",
    "we have experimented with this approach and found that the fairly small improvement in accuracy ( assuming the availability of full two - dimensional data ) comes with the price of added complexity , while it also becomes unclear how to connect the results to the true three - dimensional angular momentum @xmath24 , which is our concern here .",
    "following the general framework above , we continue with more specific galaxy models . for context ,",
    "we begin with the simple case of an infinitely thin disk that has a constant intrinsic rotation - velocity profile , which is the same as the circular velocity , @xmath305 .",
    "it also has an exponential pole - on surface density profile : @xmath306 where @xmath20 is the disk scale - length . using equation  ( [ eqn : a5 ] )",
    ", we find @xmath307 where  is the radius enclosing half of the light of a face - on disk .",
    "and we have used the relation @xmath308 for an exponential profile ( note that for other disk inclinations , the observed half - light radius is smaller ) . because the disk is infinitesimally thick",
    ", there is no dilution , except for a perfectly edge - on case , and we have simply @xmath309 .",
    "this means that the observed ( constant ) rotation velocity is @xmath80 , and we can map between observations and true specific angular momentum by the relation @xmath310 using the notation of equation  ( [ eqn : jcp ] ) , we may say alternatively that @xmath311 and @xmath31 .",
    "the exception is the perfectly edge - on case ( @xmath312 ) , where we find by constructing the appropriate analogues to equations  ( [ eqn : a5 ] ) and ( [ eqn : jest ] ) that @xmath313 .",

    "one approach is to consider the _ median _",
    "case @xmath318 , where for randomly oriented galaxies , half of them have @xmath319 ; this is equivalent to identifying the median value for @xmath30 . since random inclinations in an axisymmetric geometry are distributed uniformly in @xmath320 , the median is @xmath321 , which corresponds to @xmath322 .",
    "one may ask instead what is the _ average _ inclination correction , @xmath323 , which if applied uniformly to all observed galaxies would provide the correct ensemble average for .",
    "interestingly , the answer appears to depend on the exact question being posed .",
    "one may start in the reference frame of a galaxy ( or planetary system ) and ask what the average projection is ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . or one may start with the _ observations _ and estimate the average _ deprojection _ ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the spirit of mapping from projected to intrinsic quantities , we take the latter approach as follows .",

    "we next consider rotating spheroids , with the goals of ( 1 ) calculating the coefficient @xmath28 to be used in combination with observational estimates of  in equation  ( [ eqn : jcp ] ) ; ( 2 ) deriving an even simpler , more approximate expression for  that avoids the detailed calculation of equation  ( [ eqn : jest ] ) .",

    "approximate analytical deprojection formulae for @xmath304 are also provided in the preceding reference .",
    "if we somehow knew the intrinsic rotation - velocity profile @xmath277 , it would be straightforward to evaluate equation  ( [ eqn : a5 ] ) and find .",

    "the inclination dependence is weaker than @xmath335 , which means it is partially counteracted by the dilution effect .",
    "an example is the edge - on case ( @xmath312 ) , for which we find @xmath336 , as compared with @xmath337 if dilution were neglected . , we would have @xmath338 , which may be contrasted with the expression @xmath339 from , who took dilution and non - cylindrical rotation into account but neglected all of the angular momentum outside of 5  . ]",
    "we performed the same tests for rotation - velocity profiles that vary smoothly with radius and found very similar results .",
    "for example , @xmath28 has only a @xmath1  10% dependence on the details of the rotation - velocity profile in equation  ( [ eqn : cj2 ] ) .",
    "the implication is that given observations of spherical galaxies , we can recover an accurate estimate of  using equation  ( [ eqn : jcp ] ) and ( [ eqn : jest ] ) , where @xmath28 is a numerical factor that depends only on inclination .",
    "a simple expression for @xmath28 that is accurate to better than 3% everywhere is : @xmath340 where @xmath30 in the numerator is in radians .",
    "note that this expression for @xmath28 differs from the undiluted value by no more than 20% , which might suggest that we ignore the dilution effect in our studies of , but we include it because we want to avoid collecting multiple systematic errors of this level .    in practice ,",
    "we do not usually know the individual inclinations of spheroidal galaxies , and instead need to do a statistical deprojection as introduced above for disk galaxies .",
    "considering the median case ( @xmath321 ) , we find @xmath341 .",
    "for the inclination averaged value , we again use equation  ( [ eqn : cavg ] ) but with the spheroidal expression for @xmath28 [ equation  ( [ eqn : cj2 ] ) , where in practice only the denominator is affected by the inclination averaging ] .",
    "we find @xmath342 ; the alternative value is @xmath343 .",
    "when modeling real early - type galaxies as in the main part of this paper , we do not use any of these choices for @xmath330 .",
    "this is because our galaxy sample is not randomly selected in sub - type ( e or s0 ) , and these sub - types are known to have a systematic connection with inclination .",
    "lenticular galaxies are difficult to identify when close to face - on , so the samples of lenticular and elliptical galaxies will be biased to high and low inclinations , respectively . to correct for this bias , we adopt a simplified picture where there is only _",
    "one _ species of early - galaxy , which gets classified as e or s0 depending on whether its inclination is below or above a boundary of @xmath321 ( cf .",
    ". therefore we apply median deprojection factors of @xmath104 ( @xmath344 ) for the lenticulars , and @xmath106 ( @xmath345 ) for the ellipticals .    when applying this approach for  estimation to real data , one has to make allowances for the limited radial extent of the available @xmath346 profiles .",
    "one can still use equation  ( [ eqn : jest ] ) and extrapolate beyond the data , while taking care to quantify the uncertainties that this entails .",
    "we will provide examples of this procedure in the main text .",
    "however , a much easier approach is also possible  sacrificing some accuracy for the sake of speed and simplicity  which we outline below and test with detailed calculations .",
    "the general idea for simple  estimation is that every galaxy can be characterized by a single observed rotation velocity @xmath39 , which if substituted as a constant value in equation  ( [ eqn : jest ] ) would give the same answer as using the full @xmath347 profile .",
    "the rotation - velocity and surface brightness components in equation  ( [ eqn : jest ] ) are then separable , and we can reduce the calculation to a product of a numerical coefficient , a velocity scale , and a scale - length @xmath348 which is analogous to equation  ( [ eqn : simpform ] ) . here  is a general approximation of , and the coefficient @xmath42 is a spatial weighting factor calculated using equation  ( [ eqn : jest ] ) with @xmath347 set to unity ( i.e. , corresponding to a weighting derived from the stellar density profile combined with a radius @xmath26 lever - arm ) .",
    "@xmath42 is a function of @xmath33 , with the following handy approximation , accurate to better than 4% : @xmath349 thus , @xmath350 and @xmath351 , as in equations  ( [ eqn : jd ] ) and ( [ eqn : exact ] ) .",
    "the crux of this approach is estimating @xmath39 from observations without having to evaluate the full integral in equation  ( [ eqn : jest ] ) , nor requiring that the rotation - velocity profile be known to the outermost radii .",
    "the trick comes from realizing that every galaxy has at least one radius @xmath40 where the local projected rotation velocity is equal to @xmath39 .",
    "this radius varies from one galaxy to another , but we might expect the variation to be modest if real galaxies have rotation - velocity profiles that are not too dissimilar .",
    "the implication then is that we can simply measure the rotation velocity at the same radius @xmath352 for all galaxies and adopt @xmath353 for use in equation  ( [ eqn : k ] ) .",
    "there are two potentially different goals here : one is to pick the radius @xmath40 that yields _ on average _ the correct answer for  for a variety of galaxies ; the other is to pick a radius where the _ scatter _ in the  approximation is minimized .",
    "the anticipated origin of this scatter is the variety of radial behaviors of early - type galaxy rotation - velocity profiles , e.g. , rising or falling from central to outer regions , such that the radius @xmath40 which applies to one galaxy might not work well for another .",
    "it is the issue of scatter that is most important , since a systematic offset in  can be calibrated out and subsumed in the value of @xmath42 .",
    "we test this heuristic concept via some simple model galaxies below and via some real observations in the main text .",
    "we find that @xmath40 values anywhere in the range of @xmath1  ( 25 )  appear to work reasonably well , and in order to maximize the number of suitable galaxies , we adopt @xmath354  2  .",
    "to arrive at this point , we first experiment with galaxy models having simple power - law rotation - velocity profiles @xmath277 that range between @xmath355 and @xmath356 . for each srsic index @xmath33 , and rotation - velocity profile ,",
    "we compute  via equation  ( [ eqn : jest ] ) , next determine the equivalent @xmath39 value , and then find the radial location @xmath40 where the local projected rotation velocity is equal to @xmath39 .",
    "finally , we examine the ratio @xmath357 , [ where  is known exactly from equation  ( [ eqn : a5 ] ) ] for a range of @xmath40 , which allows us to diagnose the best values of @xmath40 to use in general .",
    "we make  and  comparisons here , rather than  and , in order to incorporate the impact of neglecting the mild dependence of @xmath28 on rotation - velocity profile [ equation  ( [ eqn : cj2 ] ) ] .",
    "this procedure is illustrated for one case ( @xmath35 , @xmath321 ) in figure  [ fig : models ] .",
    "the left - hand panel shows the intrinsic and projected rotation - velocity profiles for three different models .",
    "the horizontal lines show the values of @xmath39 which would yield the correct @xmath358 when substituting @xmath351 in equation  ( [ eqn : k ] ) .",
    "the intercept of the value with the corresponding @xmath347 profile gives the appropriate radius @xmath40 . in the right - hand panel ,",

    "for the constant - rotation - velocity model , @xmath359 for a wide range of @xmath40 , i.e. , the results are insensitive to @xmath40 .",
    "for the other rotation - velocity models , the choice of @xmath40 is more critical and ranges from @xmath360 to @xmath361 .",
    "a compromise radius that works reasonably well is @xmath362 , which provides accurate  estimates at the 15% level or better for all three models .",
    "exploring other values of @xmath33 and @xmath30 , we find that inclination is not important , and that some aspects of the @xmath35 example are generally true for other @xmath33 . for each @xmath33 , the radius @xmath40 that minimizes the errors in  among the different rotation - velocity profiles",
    "is close to the exact value of @xmath40 for the constant rotation velocity case .",
    "this `` sweet spot '' also depends systematically on the density profile : for @xmath363  2 , 4 , and 6 , it occurs at @xmath364  , 4.5  , and 10  .",
    "this @xmath40 trend demonstrates that the extended envelopes of higher-@xmath33 galaxies contribute relatively more to , and require correspondingly extended kinematics observations .",
    "given that the  values for high-@xmath33 galaxies are already large , the observations to @xmath1  10  become extremely challenging , and we will in general omit such galaxies from our current analysis . observations at @xmath43  4.5  as needed for @xmath46 galaxies are also relatively rare , but fortunately the systematic bias in when using smaller @xmath40 is small , and the scatter is still only @xmath1  @xmath55  @xmath365  dex when @xmath43  2.5  .",

    "we show that the constant @xmath39 approach works fairly well for a broad range of radii , and we adopt @xmath366 ; at this radius , the systematic offset in  appears to be small , and the galaxy - to - galaxy scatter is @xmath44  0.1  dex . exactly . ]",
    "we have thus arrived at our adopted procedure for simplified  estimation using equation  ( [ eqn : k ] ) .",
    "this  is then multiplied by the deprojection factor @xmath28 to yield an estimate of the intrinsic .",
    "of special interest is the de vaucouleurs profile ( @xmath35 ) , with the approximate result for a median inclination @xmath367 which is related to equation  ( [ eqn : exact ] ) by a factor of @xmath318 in order to account for the rotation - velocity dilution ( @xmath368 ; note that as discussed in the previous subsection , in practice , @xmath318 may need to be corrected for additional inclination - selection effects ) .",
    "this can be compared to the expression used by f83 : @xmath369 where @xmath370 was the maximum value of the projected rotation velocity within the ( central ) observed region .",
    "this formula is now superseded by the more accurate expressions above .",
    "real galaxies of course are not spheres .",
    "we could in principle set up a standard axisymmetric density model by making an ellipsoidal substitution for @xmath49 as needed with @xmath304 : @xmath371 where @xmath315 is the intrinsic axis ratio , and again we are measuring rotation velocity only along the projected semi - major axis @xmath372 . substituting this expression into equation  ( [ eqn : vrotp2 ] ) along with additional modifications of equation  ( [ eqn : cj2 ] ) , we find from some test calculations that even strong flattening makes only a very small difference to @xmath302 and to @xmath28 , which typically increase and decrease ( respectively ) by @xmath1  510% relative to the spherical case for @xmath373 .",
    "given the mildness of these effects , and the unknown systematics of the cylindrical - rotation assumption , we will not attempt to make any correction based on the flattening .",
    "the extrapolation of the kinematic data to larger radii is in any case probably the dominant uncertainty for our final results .",
    "the other potential concern here is the effective radius .",
    "we have already mentioned for disk galaxies that the value of @xmath20 used in equation  ( [ eqn : jd ] ) is not the observed but instead the deprojected value .",
    "similarly , for flattened spheroidal galaxies , we should not use in equation  ( [ eqn : k ] ) the circularized value  normally tabulated in catalogs , but the equivalent distance along the semi - major axis , @xmath374 , where @xmath375 is the observed axis ratio ( in the rest of the paper we simplify this to @xmath315 ) .",
    "this is because even though we may not know the inclination of a galaxy , we do know ( for an axisymmetric case ) that if it were face - on , the true  needed to calculate  would be roughly the same as .",
    "since early - type galaxies can be as flattened as @xmath376 , this is a significant correction .",
    "a caveat here is that the observed flattening is correlated with the inclination : e.g. , a galaxy with @xmath377 is probably nearly edge - on , and adopting the median inclination for random orientations would then cause us to overestimate its . also , the intrinsic  value for a spheroidal galaxy is slightly smaller than @xmath378 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , these two effects are much weaker in general than neglecting the @xmath375 correction entirely .",
    "therefore in the main text we carry out all of the calculations using densities and kinematics along the semi - major axis : e.g. , @xmath27 and  rather than @xmath278 and .",
    "here we present in some detail the data and methods used to derive angular momentum profiles for individual early - type galaxies .",
    "our general approach is to map all of the data to an equivalent semi - major axis rotation - velocity profile , as though making a standard long - slit observation . in some cases ,",
    "the data are already available in this format while in others that involve discrete and semi - discrete data at various position angles , we must fit a two - dimensional kinematic model before mapping onto the semi - major axis .",
    "our modeling method was recently developed for use with sparsely sampled two - dimensional data @xcite .",
    "it is based on flattened sinusoidal curves of mean line - of - sight velocity versus azimuth @xmath272 : @xmath379^{-1/2 } , \\label{eqn : quasi}\\ ] ] where  is the rotation velocity versus the semi - major axis distance @xmath26 , and @xmath380 is evaluated along an ellipse with axis ratio @xmath315 .",
    "the on - sky coordinates are the same as introduced in appendix  [ sec : form ] , but without primes ( @xmath381 ) for the sake of simplicity ; the position angle of maximum receding rotation velocity is at @xmath382 .",
    "this model is exactly equivalent both to a @xmath383 rotation velocity multiplied by the equation for an ellipse in polar coordinates , and to the classic tilted - ring approach used for gas disks ( e.g. , ) .",
    "therefore it is a natural observational model to use in conjunction with our  modeling scheme , which assumes a cylindrical rotation field in the reference frame of the galaxy ( appendix  [ sec : form ] ) .",
    "there is also a connection here to the `` kinemetric '' methods of modeling data from integral - field spectrographs , where the two - dimensional kinematics are expanded in a fourier series @xcite .",
    "our model is equivalent to the first - order term of this expansion .    in principle , the parameters @xmath315 and @xmath384 should be determined by fitting to the kinematic data , but in practice , the azimuthal sampling is often too sparse for such constraints . for the sake of a uniform treatment of the data ,",
    "we adopt the _ photometric _ values for @xmath315 and @xmath384 in every case ; these are generally held constant at a global value , e.g. , neglecting kinematic twists with radius .",
    "the errors introduced through these simplifications are generally much smaller than the uncertainties in extrapolating  outwards to radii beyond the data .",
    "figure  [ fig : n4494kin1 ] illustrates the kinematic fitting procedure for several types of data .",
    "one type that may be unfamiliar is the `` stellar kinematics with multiple slits '' ( skims ) technique from the smeagol project ( @xcite ) , which uses a wide - field multi - slit spectrograph to provide sparse sampling of a two - dimensional field as needed for reconstructing the basic kinematical structure .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : quasi ] ) is fitted to the data ( left - hand panel ) , while occasionally disregarding outlying data points so as not to skew the results .",
    "the uncertainties on the rotation velocities are estimated via monte carlo simulations of mock data sets .",
    "this procedure is modified slightly for discrete velocity data such as from pne and gcs , which are sparsely sampled not only in position but also in velocity . here",
    ", each data point is not a measure of the local mean velocity , but is a random _ discrete _ velocity drawn from an underlying distribution .",
    "the kinematic modeling of rotation therefore involves simultaneous fitting for the velocity _ dispersion _ using a maximum likelihood method ( which represents a refinement , along with the rotation - field flattening , of the commonly - used least - squares method ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "note also that when using data from the pn.spectrograph @xcite , we ignore the results inside @xmath1   since there are known systematic biases that can occur in the central regions , where pn detection may be velocity - dependent .    to combine different data sets on the same galaxy",
    ", we could in principle fit them all simultaneously to a single kinematic model .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity and transparency , we create separate one - dimensional rotation - velocity profiles from each data set separately , and then combine these into a single profile . for this final combination",
    ", we set up a new grid of data bins that are smoothly distributed in radius , and in each bin average the weighted contribution of each data point according to its uncertainties and its fractional overlap with that bin .",
    "the price of generating these well - behaved profiles is that the values in each bin are not fully independent of those in adjacent bins .",
    "a significant complication in our analysis comes in extrapolating the rotation - velocity profile beyond the outermost measured data points . in a spiral galaxy , this can be done assuming a profile that becomes asymptotically constant , but we can not assume any such model for an elliptical or lenticular .",
    "instead , we fit a power - law model of rotation velocity with radius to the final few data points : @xmath385 .",
    "the optimum range of points to use in this fit is not straightforward to determine : use too few , and the extrapolation becomes merely an amplification of noise in the outermost measurements ; use too many , and the inner measurements with their small uncertainties dominate the fit , which may not even agree with the outer measurements .",
    "therefore some degree of subjectivity is involved , where the radial region used in the fit is determined by the widest range that still appears consistent with a smooth power - law trend , which typically occurs outside @xmath1  2.5  for our sample .",
    "the permitted range of power - law exponents @xmath386 is then determined by a @xmath387 criterion . in some cases",
    "the formal range of @xmath386 is large and we adopt a plausibility prior that the rotation velocity increases no more rapidly than linearly with radius ( i.e. @xmath388 ) .",
    "note that although there may be lingering concerns about the robustness of these extrapolation procedures , half of the galaxies in our detailed sample have data out to @xmath1  810  , in which case the extrapolation is relatively unimportant for the  calculation .",

    "the issue with @xmath33 is that , as discussed in the main text , its value is a significant factor in accurate @xmath0 calculation , but is not available for some of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "instead , we use a statistical estimate based on trends among other galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : sersic ] shows the @xmath33  correlation for the early - type galaxies in our sample that _ do _ have srsic fits available .",
    "there is a correlation between  and @xmath33 that echos other trends in the literature , and in particular matches the power - law slope of @xmath414 found by @xcite .",
    "the mean relation that we adopt is @xmath415 there is a scatter of @xmath416 about this relation , which is also similar to variations found in the literature for different srsic fits of the same galaxies .",
    "this uncertainty in @xmath33 translates to an uncertainty of @xmath1  25% in @xmath42 [ see equation  ( [ eqn : kn ] ) ] , and thus @xmath1  0.1  dex uncertainty in @xmath0 [ equation  ( [ eqn : jck0 ] ) ] .    next , to investigate whether or not our galaxy sample provides an unbiased , fair representation of the nearby universe , we could check a variety of different galaxy parameters , but given our focus on angular momentum , the most relevant parameter is the readily - measured central stellar rotation velocity .",
    "our point of comparison is the 3d  survey , which presented photometric and kinematic properties for a complete , volume - limited sample of 260 nearby early - type galaxies , selected only by @xmath63-band luminosity @xcite .",
    "we use their tabulated central rotation metric , @xmath417 , which is flux - weighted in two dimensions within an aperture of @xmath418 @xcite . from the galaxies in common between our samples , we calibrate this metric to our own major - axis kinematic data measured locally at @xmath419 .",
    "we find that the 3d  values of @xmath417 should be multiplied by a factor of @xmath1  2.2 to match our data ( which , as expected , is a large difference because of the two - dimensional versus major - axis measurement locations ) .",

    "this is analogous to the standard parameter in equation  ( [ eqn : binney ] ) , but is constructed differently for the sake of convenient comparisons between the two data sets , and should not be used to make detailed inferences about the properties of these galaxies .",

    "our sample follows a similar trend to the unbiased sample , with central rotation becoming systematically less important for the more massive galaxies .",
    "both samples span a similar range in mass .",
    "another important issue here is the inclusion of different sub - classes of early - type galaxies .",
    "our sample consists of 15 lenticulars and 25 ellipticals , which implies a strong selection bias for ellipticals , since @xmath1  75% of nearby early - types are s0s @xcite .    in section  [ sec : scale ]",
    "we compare the size ",
    "mass relation of our sample ( both the early- and late - types ) with the 3d results . for 3d ,",
    "we adopt the power - law relations provided by @xcite , after adapting them to the parameters that we plot for our sample . for the spirals , we convert from circularized  to  by assuming a median inclination of @xmath421 . for the fast - rotator e / s0s",
    ", we use a median axis ratio of @xmath422 .",
    "comparison with our sample ( in figure  [ fig : size ] ) is not straightforward since we have used _ disk _ sizes rather than total galaxy sizes ( bulge+disk ) for the spirals . in any case , we find that our results are consistent overall with 3d but there appears to be a difference for the lower - mass ellipticals ; at @xmath126  1010.5 , these galaxies are @xmath1  30% more compact in our sample than the trend found by 3d .",
    "examining several galaxies in common between the samples , we find that the discrepancy persists for cases where we have made use of high - quality photometric analyses @xcite .",
    "figure  8 of @xcite suggests that for the smaller galaxies , the 3d  sizes , which are partially based on nir measurements , are overestimated relative to optically - based sizes .",
    "this illustrates the type of systematic uncertainties remaining in our analysis , and also of the comfortably low impact that they have on our   analyses ( only @xmath44  0.05  dex or @xmath44  15% in ) .",
    "one additional issue is that our sample of spirals was selected to avoid strong bars which might in principle introduce a bias in .",
    "inclusion of barred spirals could be an improvement made in a next generation , volume - limited   survey .",

    "in section  [ sec : obsresults ] , we sought to understand the ",
    "trends for spiral galaxies by considering their bulge and disk components separately .",
    "many early - type galaxies ( both lenticulars and fast - rotating ellipticals ) are also thought to consist of such subcomponents , but the decompositions tend to be more difficult . here",
    "we develop a novel method to estimate the bulge fraction , @xmath446 , in order to study correlations involving this parameter , while we also analyze a small set of ellipticals with decompositions from the literature .",
    "first , we suppose for simplicity that the relative dominance of rotation observed in an early - type galaxy indicates the disk fraction , i.e. , the bulge is assumed to be non - rotating , with all of the observed rotation attributable to the disk . this disk is assumed to rotate at the circular velocity @xmath7 , which we relate to the stellar rotation velocity and velocity dispersion , @xmath447 and @xmath161 , by @xmath448^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the observed rotation is then @xmath449 , where the parameter @xmath450 accounts for projection and aperture effects ( e.g. , a central aperture probably encloses a larger disk fraction than the global value ) . after rearranging terms",
    ", we can solve for the bulge fraction based on the observed @xmath87 parameter : @xmath451^{1/2}}\\ ] ]    next , to estimate the numerical factor @xmath450 , we calibrate against the relation between morphology and bulge fraction derived from photometric data by @xcite .",
    "as shown in the left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : scorza ] , these authors derived two alternative relations with different extrapolations for the elliptical galaxies , and we select the version that extends to @xmath452 , i.e. , with some ellipticals being truly disk - less .",
    "we then plot the 3d  data set , using their morphological types and @xmath453 values , and estimating @xmath13 using equation  ( [ eqn : fb ] ) .",
    "based on the lenticular galaxy data ( @xmath454 ) , we judge @xmath455 to provide a reasonably good match ; this is similar to our adopted model of @xmath104 for these galaxies ( appendix  [ sec : spheroid ] ) .",
    "but did not quantify a relation except to estimate @xmath456  0.850.9 as the division between fast- and slow - rotators , based on semi - analytical modeling of galaxy formation .",
    "this is consistent with our relation , since the slow / fast boundary is typically at @xmath457  0.15 , which our relation translates to @xmath456  0.85 . on the other hand ,",
    "the observational study of @xcite does _ not _ support a strong correlation between @xmath458 and @xmath13 . ] as in appendix  [ sec : obsfull ] , there is then an additional factor ( of @xmath459 at 1  ) to convert our @xmath87 observations to the 3d  values when those are not available .",
    "we estimate our final @xmath13 values to be generally accurate at the @xmath460 level .",
    "next we investigate the bulge and disk   trends for a small sample of elliptical galaxies , making use of the pioneering work of , who carried out decompositions _ including the kinematics of the bulge and disk subcomponents_. these authors reported  for the subcomponents , and concluded that while the surface brightnesses and scale - lengths of these disks were consistent with an extension of scaling relations for lenticular and spiral galaxies , the same may not be true for the disk values , with those of the ellipticals systematically lower than those of the disk galaxies .",
    "these data were further used by @xcite to support a scenario where disks in ellipticals are not related to spiral disks , but such conclusions neglected the mass dependence naturally expected for .    revisiting the data set , we take their size and rotation decompositions as given , and update the distances , stellar masses , and  calculations according to our current methodology . from a few galaxies in common , we find that these  values tend to be higher than what we would derive from scratch ( e.g. , because of decreasing rotation velocity outside the central regions ) . nevertheless , we plot the results in figure  [ fig : scorza ] ( right - hand panel ) , comparing them to the   relations that we have found for spiral disks , and for ellipticals overall ( which we recall is roughly similar to the trend for the massive bulges of spirals ) .    there does appear to be a systematic separation between the relations for the bulges and disks of these ellipticals , but not as large as we would expect based on the results for spirals . given the uncertainties in these decompositions , we conclude that it is not yet clear whether or not the disk and bulge subcomponents of ellipticals follow the same relations as in spirals .",
    "if they do , it would be natural to expect the total trend for ellipticals to be offset to slightly higher  values from the bulge trend ( owing to the disk contributions ) , which from inspection of figure  [ fig : jmm0 ] ( right - hand panel ) may indeed be true ."
