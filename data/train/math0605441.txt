    "emmanuel giroux has recently found an amazing correspondence between open book decompositions of 3manifolds and contact structures , @xcite . specifically , he has shown that any contact structure @xmath0 on @xmath1 is related to an open book through the thurston - winkelnkemper construction @xcite .",
    "this breakthrough has provided the basis for a much greater understanding of contact structures and 3manifold topology .    in this note",
    "we define three new invariants of contact structures using giroux s correspondence .",
    "let @xmath2 be a contact manifold .",
    "the first invariant is called the _ support genus _ and is simply the minimal possible genus for a page of an open book that supports @xmath3 this invariant is denoted by @xmath4 in @xcite it was shown that @xmath5 for any overtwisted contact structure and @xmath5 forces any symplectic filling of @xmath2 to have intersection form that embeds in a negative definite diagonalizable quadratic form . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that @xmath5 implies the heegaard - floer contact invariant of @xmath0 is reducible .",
    "thus it is clear that the support genus is tied to subtle geometric properties of the contact structure .",
    "we do not add much to the understanding of support genus here .",
    "this paper will concentrate on a second invariant , the _",
    "binding number_. the binding number of @xmath0 is the minimal number of binding components for an open book supporting @xmath0 and that has pages of genus @xmath4 we denote the binding number by @xmath6 note that it is important to restrict the open books considered in the definition of binding number to those that have minimal genus pages , because otherwise the binding number would always be one ( any contact structure is supported by an open book with connected binding ) .",
    "we make several computations of the binding number .",
    "the binding number of an overtwisted contact structure @xmath0 on a 3-manifold is bounded in terms of the euler class of @xmath3 in particular , the infinitely many overtwisted contact structures on a manifold with euler class zero ( or torsional ) take on finitely many binding numbers . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath1 is a rational homology sphere then there is a universal bound , depending on @xmath7 on the binding number of any overtwisted contact structure on @xmath8    through examples we also show that the binding number is really an invariant of the contact structure in that it is not determined merely by the topology of the manifold @xmath8 we also show that in certain cases the binding number can place restrictions on the topology of the contact structure .    if @xmath9 and @xmath10 then the euler class of @xmath0 is zero .",
    "we give an example showing that there are contact structures with @xmath9 but having non - zero euler class .",
    "thus the restriction on @xmath11 is necessary .",
    "this theorem follows from the following theorem .",
    "if @xmath0 is supported by an open book having two or less components in its binding and hyper - elliptic monodromy then the euler class of @xmath0 is zero .",
    "the last invariant of contact structures we define is the",
    "_ norm_. the norm of a contact structure is minus the maximal euler characteristic of a page of an open book supporting @xmath3 we denote the norm by @xmath12 we do not know if the norm of a contact structure is determined by the support genus and binding number .",
    "we are only able to establish @xmath13 thus , when @xmath14 we know @xmath15 but in general the norm might be smaller .    in section  [ openbook ] we recall the basic definitions involving open book decompositions and giroux s correspondence between them and contact structures .",
    "the following section discusses the definitions of the invariants of plane fields on 3-manifolds . in section  [ invtsec ]",
    "we give the definition of support genus and binding number .",
    "the following two sections discuss the computation of the binding number for planar and , respectively , elliptic open books .",
    "section  [ normsec ] contains the definition of the norm of a contact structure and discusses its relation to the other two invariants .",
    "we end with several fundamental questions concerning these new invariants .",
    "suppose that for an oriented link @xmath16 in a closed and oriented 3manifold @xmath1 the complement @xmath17 fibers over the circle as @xmath18 such that @xmath19 is the interior of a compact surface bounding @xmath16 , for all @xmath20 .",
    "then @xmath21 is called an _ open book decomposition _ ( or just an _ open book _ ) of @xmath1 . for each @xmath20 , the surface @xmath22",
    "is called a _",
    "page _ , while @xmath16 the _ binding _ of the open book .",
    "the monodromy of the fibration @xmath23 is defined as the diffeomorphism of a fixed page which is given by the first return map of a flow that is transverse to the pages and meridional near the binding .",
    "the isotopy class of this diffeomorphism is independent of the chosen flow and we will refer to that as the _ monodromy _ of the open book decomposition .",
    "an open book @xmath21 on a 3manifold @xmath1 is said to be _ isomorphic _ to an open book @xmath24 on a 3manifold @xmath25 , if there is a diffeomorphism @xmath26 such that @xmath27 on @xmath28 . in other words ,",
    "an isomorphism of open books takes binding to binding and pages to pages .",
    "an open book can also be described as follows .",
    "first consider the mapping torus @xmath29\\times \\sigma/(1,x)\\sim ( 0 , \\phi(x))\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is a compact oriented surface with @xmath31 boundary components and @xmath32 is an element of the mapping class group @xmath33 of @xmath30 .",
    "since @xmath32 is the identity map on @xmath34 , the boundary @xmath35 of the mapping torus @xmath36 can be canonically identified with @xmath31 copies of @xmath37 , where the first @xmath38 factor is identified with @xmath39 / ( 0\\sim 1)$ ] and the second one comes from a component of @xmath34 .",
    "now we glue in @xmath31 copies of @xmath40 to cap off @xmath36 so that @xmath41 is identified with @xmath42 / ( 0\\sim 1)$ ] and the @xmath38 factor in @xmath43 is identified with a boundary component of @xmath34 .",
    "thus we get a closed @xmath44-manifold @xmath45 equipped with an open book decomposition whose binding is the union of the core circles in the @xmath43 s that we glue to @xmath36 to obtain @xmath46 . in conclusion ,",
    "an element @xmath47 determines a @xmath44-manifold together with an  abstract \" open book decomposition on it .",
    "notice that by conjugating the monodromy @xmath32 of an open book on a 3-manifold @xmath1 by an element in @xmath33 we get an isomorphic open book on a 3-manifold @xmath25 which is diffeomorphic to @xmath1 .",
    "suppose that an open book decomposition with page @xmath30 is specified by @xmath47 .",
    "attach a @xmath48-handle to the surface @xmath30 connecting two points on @xmath34 to obtain a new surface @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath50 be a closed curve in @xmath49 going over the new @xmath48-handle exactly once .",
    "define a new open book decomposition with @xmath51 , where @xmath52 denotes the right - handed dehn twist along @xmath50 .",
    "the resulting open book decomposition is called a _ positive stabilization _ of the one defined by @xmath32 .",
    "if we use a left - handed dehn twist instead then we call the result a _ negative stabilization_. the inverse of the above process is called _ positive _ ( _ negative _ ) _ destabilization_. notice that although the resulting monodromy depends on the chosen curve @xmath50 , the 3manifold specified by @xmath53 is diffeomorphic to the 3manifold specified by @xmath54 .      given an abstract description of an open book in a 3manifold @xmath1 with page a compact oriented genus @xmath55 surface @xmath30 with @xmath31 boundary components and monodromy @xmath47 .",
    "we can determine the basic topology of @xmath1 by calculating its fundamental group and its first homology group as follows .",
    "fix a point @xmath56 on the @xmath57-th boundary component of @xmath34 , for all @xmath58 .",
    "we will calculate the fundamental group of @xmath1 based at @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath60 be the standard generators of @xmath61 based at @xmath59 , where @xmath62 s correspond to loops around the boundary components and let @xmath63 denote a loop based at @xmath56 which is transverse to all the pages of the open book , for @xmath64 .",
    "then a presentation of the fundamental group of the mapping torus @xmath36 can be given as @xmath65 \\prod_{j=1}^r c_j , \\theta_1 a_i \\theta_1^{-1}\\phi_*(a_i^{-1 } ) , \\theta_1 b_i \\theta_1^{-1 } \\phi_*(b_i^{-1 } ) ,   \\theta_1 c_j \\theta_1^{-1}\\phi_*(c_j^{-1 } )    \\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath66 , @xmath67= a_ib_i a_i^{-1}b_i^{-1}$ ] , and @xmath68 denotes the action of @xmath32 on @xmath61 .",

    "we begin by computing the rotation number of legendrian knots sitting on the page of a supporting open book .      in this section",
    "we will compute the rotation number @xmath93 of the legendrian realization of a homologically nontrivial curve @xmath50 embedded on a page of an open book .",
    "we start with @xmath94 , which is the 4ball @xmath95 union @xmath96 1handles , as shown in figure  [ page ] , where @xmath97 .",

    "the dashed line indicates the boundary of @xmath30 and dotted lines indicate generators of the homology of @xmath102    the way the attaching balls of the 1handles are identified gives a trivialization of the tangent bundle of @xmath98 .",
    "this trivialization also induces a trivialization of the tangent bundle of the page which is depicted in figure  [ page ] with its orientation induced from the blackboard : just take the usual oriented frame of @xmath103 , restrict it to the disk and extend over the 1handles .",
    "next we apply the construction of thurston and winkelnkemper in @xcite to put a contact structure @xmath0 on @xmath104 supported by its canonical trivial open book decomposition : away from the binding the contact 1form is given by @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the meridional direction to the binding , @xmath107 is a 1form transverse to the binding such that @xmath108 is an area form on @xmath30 .",
    "the pages of the open book are convex and @xmath109 is the reeb vector field which is transverse to the pages .",

    "recall that the rotation number of a legendrian curve is the winding number of its tangent vector with respect to a fixed trivialization of the contact structure over the curve .",
    "( note the contact planes can be globally trivialized since @xmath110 . ) on the other hand a smooth curve on a surface has a winding number which is defined as the winding number of its tangent vector with respect to a fixed trivialization of the tangent bundle of the surface .",
    "we conclude that the rotation number of a legendrian knot @xmath50 is the same as the winding number of the projection of @xmath50 to a page @xmath30 since we can use the same trivialization to define both invariants .",
    "this winding number can be calculated for any curve @xmath50 on the page , since we fix a trivialization of the tangent bundle of the page once we fix the attaching regions of the 1handles in figure  [ page ] .",

    "it is well - known that we can factor @xmath32 as a product of dehn twists along homologically nontrivial curves @xmath111 on @xmath30 .",
    "below we will describe a method to calculate the euler class @xmath89 ( i.e. , @xmath90 ) of the underlying 2plane field of the contact structure @xmath0 supported by this open book .",
    "note that an open book is the boundary of an achiral lefschetz fibration whose handlebody description as a 4manifold is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the curves @xmath112 which appear in the factorization of the monodromy @xmath32 of the given open book are the vanishing cycles of this achiral lefschetz fibration . consider @xmath113 s as embedded in distinct pages of the trivial open book on @xmath114 , where @xmath115 , as depicted in figure  [ page ] .",

    "note that @xmath151 , which we are assuming to be a torsion class .",
    "thus some multiple @xmath152 of @xmath148 , which naturally lives in @xmath153 , comes from a class @xmath154 in @xmath155 which can be squared .",

    "their proof caries over to our case , see @xcite .",
    "there are several obvious invariants one can define using open book decompositions associated to contact structures .",

    "if @xmath2 is a fillable contact structure and @xmath5 then any filling of @xmath2 ( 1 ) has only one boundary component , ( 2 ) has negative definite intersection form and ( 3 ) the intersection form embeds in a diagonalizable form .",

    "surprisingly , though there are many potential examples @xcite , it is still unknown if @xmath160 for any contact structure @xmath3    next we define the binding number of a contact structure .",
    "the binding number of a contact structure @xmath0 on a 3-manifold @xmath1 is the minimal number of components in the binding of the open book decomposition supporting @xmath0 that have minimal genus , @xmath161    to illustrate the difficulty in computing the binding number of a contact structure we give a simple example .",
    "consider the contact structures @xmath162 and @xmath163 in @xmath164 described by their contact surgery diagrams depicted in figure  [ iso ] .",
    "the contact structure @xmath162 can be given equivalently by two contact @xmath124surgeries performed on the same unknot with its legendrian push - off . by computing the 3dimensional invariants of @xmath165 we can see that @xmath162 is isotopic to @xmath163 and both are overtwisted .",
