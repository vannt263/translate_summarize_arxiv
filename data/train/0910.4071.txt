    ", the cross section is expressed as a sum of products of short - distance coefficients and nrqcd matix elements .",
    "the short - distance coefficients can be calculated as perturbation series in coupling constant @xmath5 at the scale of the heavy quark mass .",
    "the matrix elements scale in a definite way with the typical relative velocity @xmath6 of heavy quark in the quarkonium state .",
    "thus the production cross sections can be expressed as double expansions both in @xmath5 and in @xmath6 to any desired order .",
    "recently , the cross section of the exclusive process @xmath7 at the center - of - momentum(cm ) energy @xmath8gev was computed by chung , lee , and yu@xcite , where @xmath9 represents a @xmath1wave or @xmath2wave heavy quarkonium state with charge - conjugation parity @xmath10 , to the leading order(lo ) both in @xmath5 and in @xmath6 in the nrqcd factorization formalism .",
    "their predicted cross sections are about @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 production , respectively",
    ". some early calculations of similar processes like @xmath21 were presented in @xcite in the color - singlet model .",
    "these relatively large cross sections make the processes be measurable at the b factories . to have more precise predictions",
    ", it is necessary to carry out the calculations to higher order both in @xmath5 and in @xmath6",
    ". one may expect that those correction terms are considerable .",
    "especially , for charmonium production , both @xmath5 and @xmath22 are not small . in this paper , in the framework of nrqcd factorization formalism , we compute the short - distance coefficients of the leading nrqcd matrix element to the nlo qcd corrections both for @xmath1wave and @xmath2wave heavy quarkonium production .",
    "for the @xmath16 , we also calculate the tree level short - distance coefficient of the @xmath22 relativistic correction term .",
    "we will not perform the calculation for the nlo relativistic corrections to @xmath23 and @xmath2wave quarkonium production since the nlo nrqcd matrix elements for these states are still not determined preciously by fitting data .",
    "the nlo qcd correction to the @xmath24 was calculated first in @xcite .",
    "however , we found that their original expressions given in eqs .",
    "( 23 ) , ( 25 ) in their paper were incorrect .",
    "probably there were some typos in their equations .",
    "the nrqcd factorization formulism separates the short - distance effects happened at energy scale @xmath25 or higher , where @xmath25 is the heavy quark mass , and the long - distance effects happened at long - distance @xmath26 or larger which describes the formation of the heavy quarkonium .",
    "the short - distance effects are described by the short - distance coefficients while the long - distance ones are described by the nrqcd long - distance matrix elements . in the process @xmath27 ,",
    "the emission of the photon can be either short - distance effects or long - distance ones depending on the emitted photon being hard or soft comparing to the quark mass @xmath25 .",
    "thus when the nrqcd factorization approach is used to analyze the process of @xmath28 at the b factories , the factorization formulism for the cross sections takes different forms in the cases of @xmath9 being @xmath29 or @xmath30 state . in the former case ,",
    "the emitted photon is so hard that the short - distance process is @xmath31 .",
    "however , in the later one , the energy of the emitted photon is much less than the @xmath32 quark mass so that the emission of the photon is a long - distance effect and should be described by the long - distance matrix as an electric @xmath33 or a magnetic @xmath34 transition .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows . in section  ii",
    ", we apply the nrqcd factorization formulism to analyze @xmath35 at the b factories where we distinguish two different cases of @xmath29 or @xmath30 , corresponding to the emitted photon being hard or soft . in section  iii , we determine the short - distance coefficient for the cross section of the process @xmath36 up to the nlo radiative qcd correction for the lo matrix element and the lo short - distance coefficient for the relativistic correction term .",
    "we also discuss various limitations of those short - distance coefficients . in section  iv , we determine the short - distance coefficients for the cross sections of the processes of @xmath37 up to the nlo qcd radiative corrections and discuss various limitations .",
    "section  v contributes to discussions of the factorization form for the processes of @xmath38 with the emitted photon being soft . in section",
    "vi , we apply the obtained formulae to carry out numerical estimations for the cross sections of those processes .",
    "we also summarize our results in this section .",
    "we present the analytical nlo short - distance coefficients of the leading order nrqcd matrix elements in @xmath6 for the cross sections of @xmath36 and @xmath37 in appendix a and appendix b , respectively .",
    "in the process of @xmath40 , where @xmath9 represents a @xmath1wave or @xmath2wave heavy quarkonium state with c - parity even , an almost on - shell and near threshold @xmath41 pair is created at the short - distance scale of @xmath42 or smaller , then constitutes a heavy quarkonium @xmath9 that happened at the distance scale of @xmath26 .",
    "the production cross section can be analyzed in the nrqcd factorization formulism@xcite as double expansions both in velocity @xmath6 and in coupling @xmath5 .",
    "the factorization takes two different forms in two different cases corresponding to the emitted photon being hard and soft .    for charmonium production at the b factories via process @xmath43 , the momentum of the emitted photon satisfies @xmath44 .",
    "the photon is so hard that the short - distance effects arise from the process @xmath45 .",
    "we assign @xmath46 with @xmath47 in the collection of @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 as follows@xcite : @xmath52    the nrqcd factorization formulism for the cross section of @xmath53 ( @xmath54 , @xmath17 , @xmath55 ) takes the following uniform form : @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are nrqcd matrix elements and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the short - distance coefficients corresponding to the matrix elements .",
    "the leading contributions to the matrix elements arise from these states , which possess the same quantum numbers as @xmath47 . in ( [ eq : formular - hard ] ) , the nrqcd matrix element in the second term is suppressed by @xmath22 compared to that in the first term .",
    "the second term is usually called as the relativistic correction term .",
    "the short - distance coefficients can be expanded as power series of @xmath61 at energy scale of @xmath25 or higher .",

    "the contributions arising from @xmath1wave and @xmath2wave can be picked out .",
    "the cross section in the qcd can then be evaluated by squaring the amplitude and integrating over the phase space .",
    "the cross section of the same process can also be evaluated in the nrqcd factorization formulism with the hadron in the nrqcd matrix elements replaced with the free quark pair being of the same quantum number as @xmath9 .",
    "the short - distance coefficients @xmath88 and @xmath89 can then be inferred from equaling the cross section calculated both in the qcd and in the nrqcd factorization formulism . in our paper , we determine the @xmath90 and @xmath91 to the nlo qcd corrections in @xmath5 and @xmath92 to the lo in @xmath5 .    on the other hand , for bottomonium production at the b factories via process @xmath93 , the momentum of the emitted photon yields @xmath94 .",
    "the photon is so soft that the wave - length of the emitted photon is compatible with the size of the bottomonium .",
    "hence the emission process is sensitive to the long - distance effects .",

    "the short - distance effects arise from the contributions of the process @xmath95 with @xmath30 in a spin - triplet and a color - singlet state .",
    "so , the nrqcd factorization formulism for the cross section of @xmath96 takes the following form : @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the short - distance coefficients .",

    "since the @xmath29 is in the @xmath107 state , lorentz and cpt invariance implies that the tensor @xmath108 can only be expressed as @xmath109 where @xmath110 is a lorentz invariant quantity and can be inferred from perturbative qcd .",
