    "<S> the qss model proposed in @xcite@xcite seeks to reach a good compromise between accuracy and efficiency . by assuming that the fast variables are infinitely fast and are stable in the long - term </S>",
    "<S> , the qss model replaces the differential equations of transient dynamics by their equilibrium equations @xcite@xcite .    nevertheless , there are two issues associated with the qss model . </S>",
    "<S> the first issue is the assumption of qss model that the post - fault system is stable and the second issue is the assumption that the model is singularity - free . in response to these issues , </S>",
    "<S> a combination of the complete model and the qss model was proposed in @xcite to make sure that the post - fault system is stable in short - term time scale . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a method using newton method with optimal multiplier in @xcite and continuation - based qss analysis in @xcite were proposed to provide certain remedies for the singularity problem . </S>",
    "<S> it was conjectured that the qss model can provide accurate approximations of the long - term stability model if the qss model satisfy the assumptions stated above . </S>",

    "<S> several numerical examples illustrating limitations of the qss model are presented which show that the qss model can lead to incorrect stability assessment . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , causes for the failure of qss model are explained under nonlinear system framework and also supported by numerical results . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the qss model fails to provide correct approximations if either trajectory of the long - term stability model jumps outside of the stability region of the corresponding transient stability model or trajectory of the qss model jumps away from the stable component of the constraint manifold , while these two causes for failure of the qss model have not been mentioned in any previous work . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> explanations in nonlinear system framework are more fundamental for analysis of dynamic systems , which can lead to important steps to establish a theoretical foundation for the qss model . </S>",
    "<S> this paper is organized as follows . </S>",
    "<S> section [ sectioncompletemodel ] reviews some relevant concepts of the long - term stability model and section [ transientqss ] introduces transient stability model and the qss model which are two approximations of the long - term stability model . </S>",
    "<S> nonlinear preliminaries and framework are introduced in section [ preliminaries ] and section [ modelinnonlinear ] . </S>",
    "<S> section [ counterexample ] presents three examples showing that the qss model is stable while the long - term stability model suffers from long - term instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> also , causes for the failure are explained and analyzed using nonlinear stability theories .    [ [ sectioncompletemodel ] ]    the long - term stability model , or interchangeably complete dynamic model , for calculating system dynamic response relative to a disturbance comprises a set of first - order differential equations and a set of algebraic equations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the algebraic equations @xmath0 describing the electrical transmission system and the internal static behaviors of passive devices . </S>",
    "<S> while the transient dynamics are captured by differential equations @xmath1 which describe the internal dynamics of devices such as generators , their associated control systems , certain loads , and other dynamically modeled components . @xmath2 and @xmath3 are smooth functions , and vector @xmath4 and @xmath5 are vectors of corresponding short - term state variables and algebraic variables . </S>",
    "<S> if we take long - term dynamics into account , both continuous equations and discrete - time equations are needed and represented as : @xmath6 , @xmath7 . where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are continuous and discrete long - term state variables respectively , and @xmath10 is the maximum time constant among devices . usually , transient dynamics have much smaller time constants compared with those of long - term dynamics , as a result , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are also termed as slow ( state ) variables , and @xmath13 are termed as fast ( state ) variables . </S>",
    "<S> if we represent the above equations in @xmath14 time scale where @xmath15 , and denote @xmath16 as @xmath17 , then we have : @xmath18    the following components need to be considered in transient time scale :    @xmath19 synchronous generator , and the associated excitation system ;    @xmath19 interconnecting transmission network including static load ;    @xmath19 induction and synchronous motor load ;    @xmath19 other device such as hvdc converter and svc .    </S>",
    "<S> in long - term stability analysis , apart from the components in transient stability analysis , it should include components such as load restoration and appropriate devices for the wide range of protection and control systems that are invoked in longer time scale . </S>",
    "<S> thus the following devices need to be considered in long - term time scale @xcite@xcite :    @xmath19 exponential and thermostatically recovery load ;    @xmath19 turbine governor ( tg ) ;    @xmath19 transformer load tap changer ( ltc ) ;    @xmath19 overxcitation limiter ( oxl ) and armature current limiter ;    @xmath19 shunt capacitor / reactor switching .    note that shunt switching and ltc changing are typical events that result in discrete dynamics captured by @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> power system dynamic behaviors after a contingency are fairly complex and it requires a lot of computational efforts to do time domain simulation of the long - term stability model over long time intervals . a natural idea is to decompose the long - term stability model in order to reach a good approximation of the long - term stability model in different time scales . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the transient stability model in short term and the qss model in long term were proposed and both models are going to be briefly introduced in the next section .    [ [ transientqss ] ]    conventional practice in power system analysis has been to use the simplest acceptable system , which captures the essence of the phenomenon under study @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> transient model : @xmath20 is obtained by assuming that slow variables @xmath8 and @xmath9 are constant parameters . </S>",
    "<S> transient model has been widely used in industry and research for transient stability analysis . detailed model of generators , exciters as well as motors , hvdc converters and svc are included , while dynamics of the other components are not included in the study . </S>",
    "<S> it is because exponential or thermostatically recovery loads , and turbine governors have very slow responses from the viewpoint of transient stability @xcite , while ltc and oxl even do nt start to work in transient time scale . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the model used in transient stability analysis regard slow variables as constants .    while in the qss model , the dynamic behavior of fast variables can be considered as instantaneously fast in long - term time scale and can be replaced by its equilibrium equations @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , since transitions of @xmath12 depend on system variables , thus @xmath12 change values from @xmath22 to @xmath23 at distinct times @xmath24 where @xmath25 , otherwise , these variables remain constants . therefore the long - term stability model ( [ complete ] ) </S>",
    "<S> can be regarded as two decoupled systems ( [ couple1 ] ) and ( [ couple2 ] ) shown below . when @xmath12 change by ( [ couple1 ] ) : @xmath26 system ( [ couple2 ] ) works with freezing parameters @xmath12 : @xmath27    similarly , the qss model : @xmath28 can also be decoupled as : @xmath29 and @xmath30    generally the qss model is able to provide correct approximations of the long - term stability model with correct stability assessment , while the qss model takes much less time if larger time steps or adaptive time steps are implemented </S>",
    "<S> also , compared with the long - term stability model , the jacobian matrix of qss model can be updated only following discrete events unless slow convergence rate is observed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however as stated at the beginning , the qss model can not capture the dynamic behavior of the long - term stability model and fail to provide correct approximations of the long - term stability model in some cases . and </S>",
    "<S> little attention has been paid to this severe problem . </S>",
    "<S> the failure of the qss model is going to be further analyzed in section [ counterexample ] .    at the end of this section , a numerical example based on the ieee 14-bus system is presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ my14completeqss ] . in this numerical example , the qss model successfully provided accurate approximations of the long - term stability model , and both of them finally settled down to the same long - term stable equilibrium point ( sep ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the long - term stability of the qss model implied the stability of the long - term stability model in this case .            </S>",
    "<S> [ [ preliminaries ] ]    in this section , some relevant stability concepts from the nonlinear stability theories are briefly introduced . </S>",
