    "x - ray emission originates from the immediate vicinity of the black hole .",
    "the detection of luminous , hard , power - law - like x - ray emission , rapid variability , and the recent discovery of relativistic effects in the iron - k line profile provided excellent evidence for the presence of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in active galaxies .",
    "x - ray observations currently constitute the most powerful means to explore the black hole region of agn .",
    "x - rays at the centers of agn arise in the accretion - disk  corona system . on larger scales , but still within the central region , x - rays might be emitted by a hot intercloud medium at distances of the broad or narrow - line region .",
    "the x - rays which originate from the accretion - disk region are reprocessed in form of absorption and partial re - emission ( e.g. , george & fabian 1991 , netzer 1993 , krolik & kriss 1995 , collin - souffrin et al . 1996 , komossa & fink 1997 ) as they make their way out of the nucleus .",
    "the reprocessing bears the disadvantage of veiling the _ intrinsic _ x - ray spectral shape , and the spectral disentanglement of many different potentially contributing components is not always easy",
    ". however , reprocessing also offers the unique chance to study the physical conditions and dynamical states of the reprocessing material , including the outer parts of the accretion disk ; the ionized absorber ; the torus , which plays an important role in agn unification schemes ( antonucci 1993 ) ; and the blr and nlr .",
    "detailed modeling of the reprocessor(s ) is also indispensable to recover the shape and properties of the _ intrinsic _ x - ray spectrum .",
    "there are two key abilities of the new x - ray observatories _ xmm - newton _",
    "( e.g. , jansen et al . 2001 ) and _ chandra _",
    "( e.g. , tananbaum & weisskopf 2001 , weisskopf et al . 2002 ) .",
    "one is the superb spatial resolution of _ chandra _ , providing images rich in details on the 1arcsec - level for the first time .",
    "the other is the increase in spectral resolution of _ xmm _ and _ chandra _ , providing x - ray spectra with such a wealth of features including many narrow absorption and emission lines , detected in x - rays for the first time .",
    "both missions have imaging detectors ( energy bandpass @xmath1(0.110 ) kev ) and grating spectrometers aboard .",
    "below , a short review of results from these observatories is given .",
    "due to space limitations it will necessarily be incomplete , both in topics covered and in citations given .",
    "my apologies in advance .",
    "among the first published agn x - ray images taken with _",
    "chandra _ was that of ngc1068 ( young et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the image demonstrated the outstanding spatial resolution power of the x - ray observatory . while it had been noted before that the x - ray emission of ngc1068 was extended , with _",
    "chandra _ for the first time a wealth of details was seen .",
    "one could actually immediately realize one was looking at a _ galaxy _ just by inspecting the x - ray image ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the following details could be recognized ( young et al . 2001 ) : a bright compact core ( 165pc ) , emission extending to the north - east coincident with the nlr , and large - scale emission partly tracing the spiral arms .",
    "similarly spectacular is the x - ray spectrum of ngc1068 , addressed below ( sect .",
    "the nearby seyfert galaxy ngc4151 is among the best studied agn across the electromagnetic spectrum . again , its extended x - ray emission was noted previously ( e.g. , elvis et al .",
    "details remained unknown , though .",
    "_ chandra _ resolved the extended emission ( ogle et al . 2000 ) , showed that it is spatially coincident with the nlr and of high temperature .",
    "ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) are characterized by their huge luminosity output in the infrared , powered by central starburst and/or agn activity .",
    "x - rays provide an excellent tool to search for deeply obscured agn at the centers of ulirgs , and also allow to trace starburst - superwind activity . with _",
    "chandra _ , the ulirgs mrk273 ( xia et al . 2002 ) , mrk 231 ( gallagher et al . 2002b ) and arp 220 ( clements et al .",
    "2002 ) were resolved in x - rays , revealing many details . since there is a separate review on ulirgs ( xia , these proceedings )",
    ", the rest of this section will concentrate on ngc6240 , a recent _ chandra _ observation of which revealed some surprises : despite decades of searches and debates whether an agn is present at all in this source ( for an overview see sect . 2 of komossa & schulz 1999 )",
    ", a clear detection remained elusive prior to the registration of hard x - ray emission beyond 2 - 10 kev with _",
    "rosat _ , _ asca _ , and particularly _ bepposax _ and _ rxte_. both , _ beppo - sax _ and _ rxte _ did not posses spatial resolution across the field of view , but",
    "the most likely counterpart of the hard x - ray emission was argued to be ngc 6240 .",
    "the unprecedented spatial resolution of _ chandra _ , coupled with simultaneous energy information , let to the detection of luminous , hard x - ray emission and strong neutral iron lines from _ both _",
    "_ cores _ of the galaxy ( fig .",
    "these properties are the characteristic features of the presence of agn , implying _ both _ cores of ngc6240 are active ( komossa et al .",
    "the two supermassive black holes are presently separated by @xmath13000ly .",
    "the final merging of these black holes is expected to produce a strong gravitational wave signal of the kind detectable with the future space - borne observatory lisa ( e.g. , danzmann 1996 , centrella 2003 ) .",
    "in addition to the double black hole , ngc6240 exhibits luminous extended x - ray emission , first detected with the instruments aboard _ rosat _ ( e.g. , schulz et al .",
    "1998 ) , and spatially and spectroscopically resolved with _",
    "chandra _ ( komossa et al . 2003 ) .",
    "it is very likely related to starburst - superwind activity and changes its rich structure in dependence of energy .",
    "while the more extended starburst loops have a lower x - ray temperature , there is also a more compact component surrounding the two nuclei which is of higher temperature and shows a tendency for higher metal abundances than the more extended component .",
    "_ chandra _ observations of more ulirgs are expected to provide a sharp and detailed look at the very centers of these galaxies in the coming years",
    ".    0.3 cm",
    "for the first time , high - resolution spectroscopy of agn can be performed in x - rays . with the exception of a few high - quality _ asca _ spectra of nearby agn , the number of x - ray features typically seen in agn spectra was 2 - 3 .",
    "this strongly increased now ; typically @xmath120 - 30 features are detected in the spectra of nearby agn and even more in the brightest , best - studied objects .",
    "a special role is played by warm absorbers . recognized earlier ( see komossa 1999 for a pre-_chandra _ review ) , they have now become the most important x - ray diagnostic of the central region of agn , imprinting many absorption lines on soft x - ray spectra of seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "there have even been suggestions that the emission - lines detected in nearby seyfert 2 galaxies are also related to ionized absorbers , seen from the side .",
    "basically , the trend emerged that seyfert 1 x - ray spectra are dominated by absorption , while seyfert 2 x - ray spectra are dominated by emission - lines .",
    "there are some exceptions , like ngc4151 , a classical seyfert1 galaxy of type 1.5 ( e.g. , osterbrock & koski 1976 ) , which in x - rays looks more like a seyfert2 ( e.g. , kahn et al . 2001 ) .",
    "only very few agn x - ray spectra turned out to be completely featureless ( e.g. , marshall et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "i would like to start , again , with ngc1068 .",
    "both , _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ had a deep look at this galaxy ( e.g. , kahn et al . 2001 , kinkhabwala et al .",
    "2002 , brinkman et al . 2002 ) .",
    "its soft x - ray spectrum is extremely rich in emission lines and is dominated by h - like and he - like ions of low @xmath2 , and by fe - l shell ions ( fig .",
    "3 ) . kinkhabwala et al .",
    "( 2002 ) inferred that the emission - line spectrum is photoionized by the nuclear continuum , and pointed out that the inferred column densities of the ions in the x - ray gas match those derived for warm absorbers detected by absorption - spectroscopy of seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "the relatively cold x - ray gas spatially coincides with the optical ionization cones of ngc 1068 .",
    "the inferred broad distribution of ionization parameters necessary to explain the x - ray spectrum , requires the presence of a distribution of densities ( several orders of magnitude ) at each radius in the ionization cone ( brinkman et al .",
    "2002 , kinkhabwala et al .",
    "it is interesting to note , that photoionization modelling of the _ optical _ radiation cone spectrum of ngc 4151 ( schulz et al .",
    "1993 ) and of the optical spectra of seyfert 2 galaxies ( komossa & schulz 1997 ) reached the same conclusion ( i.e. , the requirement of a range in densities at fixed radius in order to reproduce the observed emission lines ) .",
    "while most attention now is focussed on employing the new observatories in orbit , a number of surprises and exciting results may still linger in the archives of _ rosat _ , _ asca _ and _ bepposax _ data .",
    "making use of archival _ rxte _ , _ bepposax _ and _ asca _ data , colbert et al .",
    "( 2002 ) reported the detection of a flare in the 6.7 kev fek emission - line of ngc 1068 .",
    "the line is interpreted as arising in warm reflecting material in the center ( @xmath3 0.2 pc from the agn core ) of the galaxy .",
    "the x - ray emission lines detected in the spectra of several more seyfert 2 galaxies ( e.g. , mrk 3 and the circinus galaxy ) and in ngc4151 , contain important information on the physical conditions in the line - emitting medium , like temperature , density , and the main gas excitation / ionization mechanism ; photoionization or collisional ionization .",
    "of particular importance in determining the main power mechanism of the lines are the helium - like triplets , the widths of the radiative recombination continua , and the strengths of the fe - l complexes .",
    "the emission lines in the x - ray spectrum of ngc4151 ( ogle et al .",
    "2000 ) are narrow and exhibit properties characteristic for the narrow - line region .",
    "this is the first x - ray nlr detected .",
    "the general trend emerged , that the extended gas in seyfert2 galaxies appears to be photoionized out to relatively large distances from the nucleus .",
    "neutral ( ` cold ' ) or ionized ( ` warm ' ) gaseous material is ubiquitous in the agn / smbh environment , and therefore of utmost importance in understanding the agn phenomenon , the evolution of active galaxies , their link with starburst galaxies and ulirgs , and the x - ray background .",
    "x - ray absorption and emission features provide valuable diagnostics of the physical conditions in the x - ray gas",
    ".    _ chandra _ spectroscopy of ngc5548 , performed with the _ low energy transmission grating spectrometer _ , letgs , revealed for the first time a system of deep narrow absorption lines in the x - ray spectrum of an agn ( kaastra et al .",
    "2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "these lines arise from ionized material in the nucleus of ngc5548 and show a range of ionization states .",
    "while all agn in deep fields are exposed for megaseconds , the record for the deepest grating observation of a nearby galaxy is held by ngc3783 .",
    "the warm absorber of this source was discovered in pioneering work by turner et al .",
    "the 900ks _ chandra _ spectrum ( e.g. , fig . 1 of kaspi et al . 2002 ) exhibits a wealth of absorption ( and emission ) features .    using _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ , absorption - complexes were detected and studied in several more agn , including iras 13349 + 2438 ( sako et al .",
    "2001 ) , ngc4051 ( collinge et al . 2001 ) , ngc3227 ( komossa et al . 2001 ) , mcg@xmath46 - 30 - 15 ( branduardi - raymont et al .",

    "2002 ) , ark 564 ( marshall 2002 , matsumoto et al . 2002 ) and ngc3516 ( netzer et al . 2002 ) .",
    "generally , the trend emerges that the warm absorbers are complex multi - component structures with a range in ionization parameters .",
    "the detailed atomic physics involved in producing the x - ray spectra of seyfert galaxies , and the consequences for our understanding of the central region of agn , are still under scrutiny .",
    "the x - ray spectra of the brightest agn are so rich , that it will take a while until all available information is extracted from them .",
    "the iron lines beyond 6 kev are the most important diagnostics at these energies ( see fabian 2001 , obrien et al .",
    "2003 for reviews ) .",
    "if the line is formed in the inner parts of the accretion - disk , its profile reflects the general relativistic effect of gravitational redshift and the special relativistic effects of beaming and transverse doppler effect .",
    "the best - studied iron - line case is mcg@xmath46 - 30 - 15 . at certain times ,",
    "the red wing of mcg@xmath46 - 30 - 15 is very broad , extending down to very soft energies ( wilms et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "_ xmm _ and _ chandra _ confirmed and further corroborated that the iron line profiles are complex and that many components of the active nucleus may contribute to iron - line emission , including likely the blr ( ngc5548 ) , the torus ( ngc3783 , mrk205 ) , the x - ray ionization cone of ngc1068 , and a contribution from the outer parts of the accretion disk ( mcg@xmath46 - 30 - 15 ) .",
    "a particularly interesting case is the iron - line complex of ngc 3516 .",
    "turner et al .",
    "( 2002 ) reported the presence of several narrow components within the fek@xmath5 profile of this galaxy .",
    "their origin is still somewhat unclear .",
    "more details on the iron - line topic are given in the contributions by j. wilms and t. wang ( these proceedings ) .",
    "broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars are characterized by broad uv absorption lines .",
    "it has been suggested that these lines arise in a flow of gas which rises vertically from a narrow range of radii from the accretion disk .",
    "the flow then bends and forms a conical wind moving radially outwards ( elvis 2000 ) .",
    "variants of radiatively - driven disk - winds were explored ( e.g. , murray et al .",
    "1995 , proga et al .",
    "2000 , proga 2001 , everett et al .",
    "2002 ) . in some of these models",
    ", an x - ray absorber shields the wind downstream from soft x - rays , allowing resonant - line driving to remain effective and accelerate the outflowing bal wind up to @xmath10.1c .",
    "pre-_chandra / xmm _ detections of bal quasars in x - rays were rare .",
    "generally , bal quasars are x - ray weak , which is usually interpreted in terms of strong excess absorption ( e.g. , green et al .",
    "1995 , gallagher et al . 1999 ,",
    "brinkmann et al . 1999 ,",
    "brandt et al .",
    "2000 , wang et al . 2000 ) .",
    "_ chandra _ provided valuable new constraints on the amount of absorption towards selected bals ( e.g. , sabra & hamann 2001 , oshima et al .",
    "2001 , gallagher et al .",
    "2002 , sabra et al .",
    "2002 ) , and an _ xmm _ observation let to a new identification of the x - ray counterpart of the bal quasar phl 5200 ( brinkmann et al .",
    "almost all data still suffer from low s / n ( typically 50 to few hundred detected x - ray photons ) , though .",
    "there are indications that the bal material is ionized instead of neutral .",
    "this is definitely the case for the quasar apm 08279 + 5255 which has the best - measured x - ray spectrum of any bal quasar i am aware of .",
    "apm 08279 + 5255 is magnified by a gravitational lense and is among the most luminous objects in the universe ( even after correction for lensing ) . a 100ks _ xmm - newton _ observation ( fig .",
    "4 ) led to the detection of a strong absorption feature of ionized iron , interpreted as k - edges , arising from a warm absorber of high column density ( hasinger et al .",
    "2002 ) . a recent _ chandra _ spectrum shows similar , but not identical features , in the sense that the high - energy dip in the spectrum is interpreted / modeled in terms of two highly blueshifted ( in the quasar rest frame ) iron - lines rather than edges ( chartas et al . 2002 ) . combining the available observations , variability in the bal - flow",
    "is implied .",
    "the inferred abundance of fe / o @xmath6 3 @xmath7 solar is rather high , given the high redshift of the object ( hasinger et al .",
    "taken at face value , it implies an efficient iron production mechanism in the early universe and provides independent evidence for the presence of a cosmological constant ( see fig . 4 of komossa & hasinger 2003 ) .",
    "the unusual strength of the iron features and the indications for strong variability make apm 08279 + 5255 an excellent target for simultaneous , deep follow - up observations with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_.      evidence for excess x - ray absorption was found in high - redshift , mostly radio - loud , quasars ( e.g. , wilkes et al .",
    "1992 , elvis et al .",
    "1994 , schartel et al .",
    "1997 , yuan et al .",
    "1998 , vignali et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the ionization state of the absorber remained largely unknown .",
    "however , there is now growing evidence that these absorbers are ionized , not neutral . as shown by schartel et al .",
    "( 1997 ) the spectrum and spectral changes of the high - redshift quasar pks2351 - 154 ( @xmath0=2.67 ) are well explained by the presence of an ionized absorber of column density @xmath8 which changes its ionization state in response to intrinsic luminosity changes of the quasar .",
    "pks2351 - 154 is one of the very few high-@xmath0 quasars which show a _ variable _ uv absorption system as well . for several years",
    ", this quasar held the record of being the most distant x - ray warm - absorber candidate known , recently exceeded by gb1428 + 42 and pmnj0525 - 33 ( fabian et al .",
    "2001a , b ) .    among the open questions related to absorption in ( distant )",
    "quasars are : what is the origin and nature of the high - z excess absorbers ? is this material preferentially warm or cold ?",
    "why has it been more abundant in the past ?",
    "how does it evolve ? why is excess absorption mainly seen in high - redshift radio-_loud _ quasars whereas a number of ( non - bal ) high - z radio-_quiet _ quasars appear to be absorption - free ? answers to these questions are crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of agn .",
    "apart from measuring ionic column densities , a very interesting prospect is to determine element abundances in dust and gas at high redshift .      _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm _ were used to search for and successfully detect x - rays from the highest redshift quasars , identified in the course of the sdss ( e.g. , brandt et al . 2001 , @xmath0=5.80 ; mathur et al .",

    "most of the highest redshift quasars tend to be underluminous in x - rays .",
    "it is presently being investigated whether this is due to evolutionary effects in the spectrum or the amount of absorption , or something else . the detailed analysis of accreting black holes in the early universe ,",
    "i.e. , the highest redshift quasars , will also be a major goal of future x - ray missions .",
    "the status of the identification of many nearby and distant agn in deep fields , and the implications , is summarized by g. hasinger ( these proceedings ) and hasinger ( 2003 ) .",
    "while current x - ray missions like _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ are still expected to provide many new exciting results , the new generation of x - ray survey missions will constitute a very useful supplement , by repeatedly re - scanning the whole x - ray sky .",
    "this will lead to detections of numerous new x - ray sources , and all kinds of unusual variability events among agn . among the planned missions are _ lobster _ ( fraser 2001 ) , _ rosita _ ( predehl 2003 ) , and _ maxi _ ( mihara 2001 ) which will cover different energy bands with different spatial and spectral resolution . in the long run , follow - ups of _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ will come : the japanese missions _",
