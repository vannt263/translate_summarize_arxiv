    "first of all , contrary to the claims of xu et al .",
    "@xcite , the cv experiment of  @xcite is performed with cheap room - temperature components ( optical modulators and homodyne detectors ) in a regime of parameters which are easily achievable in practice .",
    "modulations of @xmath0 shot noise units are relatively low with respect to what is achievable ( @xmath1 and more ) .",
    "reconciliation efficiencies of @xmath2 are currently state - of - the - art in cv - qkd experiments  @xcite .",
    "an experimental excess noise @xmath3 is not low but typical , fully comparable with the values reported in the fibre - optic experiment of  @xcite , where the experimental excess noise was estimated to be @xmath4 at @xmath5data points and @xmath6 at @xmath7data points , for bob s detection at @xmath8  km . at lower distances",
    "@xmath9  km ( as is in our case ) , the excess noise is expected to be smaller , which means that our experimental value @xmath3 can even be considered relatively high .",
    "the robustness of cv - mdi - qkd against excess noise can also be appreciated from the analysis done in the supplementary section ie6 of  @xcite ( in particular , see fig .  5 there ) , where the security thresholds are proven to be robust against much higher excess noise ( @xmath10 @xmath11 ) .",
    "then , xu et al.@xcite completely missed an important advantage of cv - mdi - qkd , which is the extremely good performance of cv  detection performed at the relay .",
    "this crucial feature relies on two basic facts :    ( 1 ) : :    the detection setup of cv - mdi - qkd is completely different from that of    one - way cv - qkd  protocols .",
    "( 2 ) : :    cv bell detection is deterministic and highly efficient ( also in    telecom setups ) .",
    "let us explain these points in detail and the reader may also refer to the panels in fig .",
    "[ pmscheme ] .    in one - way ( or point - to - point ) cv - qkd protocols ( see fig .  [ pmscheme]a )",
    ", alice prepares outgoing quantum states while bob detects states incoming from the channel .",
    "because of this configuration , only the loss within alice s station can be trusted and , therefore , neglected by re - scaling the signal level at the output of alice s box .",
    "the loss within bob s station can not be re - scaled since it is added on top of channel loss and noise ( any re - scaling will also amplify the loss and noise of the channel , without any signal - to - noise advantage ) .",
    "for this reason , bob s overall quantum efficiency is limited and this clearly affects fibre - optic implementations at telecom wavelengths .",
    "for instance , a quantum efficiency of @xmath12 was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite due to optical manipulations and photo - detection ( however , note that this specific value of @xmath12 can be improved and , therefore , should not be considered as a fundamental limit for the detection in one - way cv - qkd protocols ) .",
    "by contrast , in the setup of cv - mdi - qkd depicted in fig .",
    "[ pmscheme]b , _ both _ alice and bob prepare outgoing quantum states in their private stations , where loss and noise are trusted . for this reason , both the signal levels of alice and bob can be set at the output of their stations , so that the effect of the internal losses can be completely neglected .",
    "untrusted loss and noise will only affect the channels and the detection at the relay .",
    "the latter has extremely high efficiencies , indeed @xmath13 in our free - space experiment at optical wavelengths ( @xmath14 nm ) .",
    "here it is worth remarking that the cv version of  bell detection can be done deterministically with simple linear optics and photodetection  @xcite , contrarily to the @xmath15 probability success affecting dv - mdi - qkd and the  typical @xmath16 value bounding teleportation experiments with photonic qubits  @xcite .",
    "most importantly , the quantum efficiency of the homodyne detectors in cv bell detections is extremely high .",
    "contrary to the incorrect claims of xu et al .",
    "@xcite , homodyne detectors with high efficiencies have been seen in both optical and telecom setups :    [ optical setups ] : :    these include the various free - space cv teleportation    experiments  @xcite , but also fibre - based experiments , such as    ref .",
    "@xcite , where coupling efficiency to a fibre can be as    high as @xmath17 and the quantum efficiency of    photo - detectors can be @xmath18 , with an overall efficiency    of about @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "[ telecom setups ] : :    for instance , see ref .",
    "@xcite , where the performance of a balanced    homodyne detection at @xmath20 nm is @xmath21 , by    means of ingaas pin diodes with an active area of    @xmath22 m in diameter and a quantum efficiency of    @xmath23 , together with a fringe visibility of    @xmath24 at the beamsplitter .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite , where    the overall efficiency of the balanced homodyne detector at    @xmath20 nm is @xmath25 .",
    "this is performed in free    space at the output of a @xmath26  m fibre , and the total    @xmath25 efficiency includes both fibre in - coupling ( the    largest source of loss ) and outcoupling ( estimated to be    @xmath27 )  @xcite .    a simple fibre - optic implementation of cv - mdi - qkd at telecom wavelengths can be done as shown in fig .",
    "[ pmscheme]c . here",
    "the loss within alice s and bob s stations ( e.g. , associated with fibre connections and modulators ) can all be re - scaled as trusted loss . at the relay , the cv bell detection can be done in free space .",
    "the efficiency associated with fibre out - coupling is close to @xmath28 if the fibre facet is anti - reflection coated .",
    "the efficient of the subsequent cv bell detection is basically determined by the homodyne detectors which may have @xmath21 efficiency at @xmath20 nm  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the cv bell detection can be done in the simplified setup of ref .",
    "@xcite involving a balanced beam - splitter and two photodectors .",
    "considering @xmath29 db insertion loss for the beam splitter and @xmath30 efficiency for the diodes  @xcite , one realizes a cv bell detection with @xmath31 efficiency .",
    "this means that the performance of our proof - of - principle experiment can be achieved in a future fibre - optic telecom implementation , contrary to the conjectures made by xu et al .",
    "@xcite  where the protocol was analysed by assuming too low efficiencies for the detection at the relay ( down to @xmath32 ) .",
    "unfortunately , yet other claims made by xu et al .",
    "@xcite were wrong .",
    "contrarily to what they state :    * ( i )  the asymptotic rate of  @xcite is not an upper bound but a lower bound with respect to all possible attacks*. in fact , the experimental rate is computed from alice and bob s shared classical data assuming the whole environment belongs to eve .",
    "then , the theoretical rate is derived against optimal attacks .",
    "more precisely , this is minimized over all two - mode gaussian attacks in normal form after the application of the de finetti theorem and the extremality of gaussian states  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast with the partial ( and purely numerical ) analyses in  @xcite which only considered the simple case of two independent entangling cloner attacks , as thoroughly discussed in ref .",
    "more details may be found in  @xcite .    *",
    "( ii )  finite - size effects against coherent attacks  @xcite and composable security in the presence of collective attacks  @xcite support our results*. it is true that our theoretical rate is derived in the asymptotic limit of infinite signals but there is no evidence that it would be sensibly affected by finite - size analyses .",
    "in fact , the current finite - size analyses tend to the asymptotic limit for blocks of @xmath33 data points ( e.g. , see fig .  1  of @xcite ) , which is the size considered in our  experiment  @xcite .",
    "this is also the size of data blocks considered in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the finite - size key rate is shown to well - approximate the asymptotic regime , especially below @xmath34  km , as is clear from fig .  2 of @xcite .",
    "note that ( point - to - point ) coherent - state protocols are composable - secure against general coherent attacks , but the present proof techniques are not sufficient to prove fast convergence  @xcite .",
    "the fact that a proof is currently missing does not mean that such convergence can not be shown with another method , i.e. , there is no fundamental reason to conjecture that the composable - secure key rates of  coherent - based cv - qkd  protocols should not fastly converge to the asymptotic values .",
    "indeed this fast convergence has been already proven in the most general case for squeezed - state cv - qkd  @xcite . by contrast",
    ", we note that finite - size analysis seems to be very demanding  for dv - mdi - qkd , where blocks of @xmath35 data points are needed for achieving reasonably non - zero rates with practical detectors ( see fig .  4 of  @xcite ) .",
    "* ( iii )  the relay does nt need to be in alice s lab*. in fact , all configurations ( symmetric or asymmetric ) show a non - trivial advantage with respect to dv - mdi - qkd at metropolitan distances ( @xmath36 km ) .    *",
    "( iv )  the use of a single local oscillator is not a major security flaw in cv - qkd and its removal is no longer an experimental challenge*. the use of a single local oscillator is typical in all cv - qkd implementations so far . practical security against its potential manipulation can be achieved if one implements an accurate real - time measurement of the experimental shot noise  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , cv - qkd can also be implemented using two independent local oscillators followed by classical post - processing  @xcite .",
    "thus , the source requirements  brought up by xu et al .",
    "( appendix  d of  @xcite ) are easily overcome .",
    "regarding this issue of using a single laser , it is important to remark that xu et al.s comment  @xcite is not just against cv - mdi - qkd but the entire field of cv - qkd . according to xu et al.s ` criteria ' , all cv - qkd protocols implemented so far , including the first ground - breaking table - top experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite and the long - distance experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite would nt be , as they put it , properly designed qkd  demonstrations  for their use of a single local oscillator .    *",
    "( v )  fast homodyne detectors exist plus cvs remain superior even on slower clocks*. in the optical range , homodyne detection can be done at ghz - bandwidths  @xcite , with @xmath37mhz detectors being available with efficiencies @xmath38  @xcite and , more recently , @xmath1mhz detectors at @xmath30 efficiency  @xcite .",
    "this is a technology which has large room of development at telecom wavelengths , where a field implementation of cv - qkd has been already achieved at @xmath39mhz clock  @xcite .",
    "this scenario has to be compared with the @xmath40mhz clock rate implemented in dv - mdi - qkd  @xcite , while @xmath39ghz has only been used for point - to - point bb84 , with detector efficiencies of about @xmath41  @xcite ( now increasable up to @xmath42  @xcite ) .",
    "here it is important to note that the difference , in terms of bits per use , can be so large that cvs may achieve higher rates than dvs while using much slower clocks .",
    "for instance , in the case of point - to - point qkd , a @xmath43mhz - clock cv protocol is already sufficient to outperform a @xmath39ghz - clock protocol with dvs at metropolitan distances  @xcite .",
    "since there are about three orders - of - magnitude in the rate ( bits per use ) between practical cv - mdi - qkd and practical dv - mdi - qkd , the cv protocol could run on clocks which are three orders - of - magnitude slower and still achieve the same performances of dvs .",
    "for this reason , a fibre - based telecom implementation of cv - mdi - qkd at @xmath44mhz is hard to beat by any practical implementation of dv - mdi - qkd ( see below for a full clarification of the word practical  in this context ) .",
    "having refuted the various incorrect claims and conjectures made by xu et al .",
    "regarding cvs , we now perfom a detailed comparison between cvs and dvs , considering a realistic analysis of dv - mdi - qkd .",
    "we can easily see that practical parameters and cheap components for dvs are certainly * not * those stated in xu et al.s comment  @xcite but those considered by four of these same authors in an earlier paper on practical aspects  of dv - mdi - qkd  @xcite .",
    "practical dv - mdi - qkd involves standard single - photon detectors with @xmath45 efficiency and a @xmath46 dark count rate , together with typical values of the intrinsic error rate @xmath47 and error correction efficiency parameter @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "this is state - of - the - art for room - temperature ( 20@xmath49c ) or thermoelectrically cooled ( -50@xmath49c ) semiconductor ( ingaas ) avalanche photodiodes ( apd ) detectors  @xcite , typically operating at @xmath50 efficiency but with increasing dark counts ( see fig .  2 of  @xcite ) .",
    "assuming these realistic and practical parameters , one can easily compute an estimate of the rate for dvs by assuming infinite decoy states , neglecting finite - size effects and other errors such as time - jitter and mode mismatch ( see appendix for details ) . from fig .",
    "[ figure ] we see how the rate of the practical dv - mdi - qkd is below that of the practical cv - mdi - qkd by @xmath51 orders - of - magnitude over metropolitan distances , from @xmath52 km in the symmetric case up to @xmath53 km in the most asymmetric configuration .",
    "it is interesting to study the maximum rate that one can achieve with dvs by using semiconductor detectors .",
    "since we are interested in short to medium distances and high rates , the choice is for detectors with the highest efficiency ( despite their high dark counts ) .",
    "the best solution appears to be the very recent ingaas / inp apds operated in optimized self - differencing mode at room temperature by toshiba  @xcite .",
    "these achieve @xmath54 efficiency with background rates @xmath55 at 20@xmath49c .",
    "fixing @xmath48 and considering @xmath56 in the range @xmath57 we can estimate the optimal performance of realistic dv - mdi - qkd in the lower gray band shown in fig .  [ figure ] .",
    "as we see from the figure , the optimal dv - mdi - qkd with semiconductor detectors is very good but still between 2 and 3 orders of magnitude below the already experimentally achieved cv rate over typical metropolitan ranges .    in their comment , xu et al .",
    "@xcite compared our practical cv experiment with a purely - theoretical numerical extrapolation for dvs , which is based on nearly - ideal parameters and devices .",
    "in particular , they consider an extremely - low intrinsic error rate @xmath58  @xcite ( which would be very demanding to realise with real - time modulators in a scalable practical network )  and the most advanced superconducting nanowire single - photon detectors ( snspds ) .",
    "these detectors operate below 2k with @xmath59 efficiency and a @xmath46 background rate  @xcite . it is interesting to note that two of the authors of xu et al .",
    "@xcite seem to be aware of the limitations of the applicability of these snspds to a real practical scenario , as they openly admitted in a previous publication:@xmath60}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is evident that such an ideal and cryogenic version of dv - mdi - qkd is too demanding for the realistic construction of a scalable network ( more details may be found in  @xcite ) . remarkably , even considering these over - optimistic parameters , our practical cv protocol is still @xmath61 order - of - magnitude better than this ideal extrapolation with dvs in all the configurations of fig .",
    "[ figure ] .",
    "furthermore , one can easily verify that the dv rate collapses down by another @xmath62 orders - of - magnitude by employing more standard snspds with @xmath63  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , slight improvements in the reconciliation efficiency of classical protocols of error correction and privacy amplifications may provide further non - trivial gains for cvs . as we see in fig .",
    "[ figure ] , the cv theoretical rates with ideal reconciliation ( @xmath64 ) is very close to the secret - key capacity of the total alice - bob channel  @xcite , achievable by cv - qkd protocols .",
    "that being said , our analysis here does not want to discourage the implementation of dv - mdi - qkd at metropolitan distances .",
    "while xu et al.s cryogenic version of dv - mdi - qkd does not seem to be suitable for building a realistic and low - cost metropolitan network , an implementation of dv - mdi - qkd with room - temperature ( or slightly - cooled ) semiconductor - based single - photon detectors is not only realistic but appealing , and may be the basis of a secure quantum network with intermediate rates .",
    "we therefore strongly encourage serious and careful research in this direction . it would also be interesting to explore potential hybrid dv - cv approaches ,",
    "as it is now happening for other quantum protocols ( e.g. , see quantum teleportation  @xcite ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "our take - home message is the following : dv - mdi - qkd is very good for long distances  @xcite , but its rate struggles to be increased at various distances , thus motivating the proposal of alternate strategies by the community  @xcite . by contrast , cv - mdi - qkd  @xcite struggles with long distances but can potentially provide much higher rates at the metropolitan range ( @xmath36 km ) , extending what happens for point - to - point cv - qkd  @xcite .",
    "this statement must not come as a surprise since cv systems are fragile to loss ( limiting distance ) but they can encode a lot of information thanks to their theoretically infinite - dimensional hilbert space  @xcite . furthermore , besides the use of cheap and practical devices , cvs can easily go broadband .",

    ", it is generally impossible to derive a simple closed formula in terms of all the parameters describing alice and bob s shared state ( in particular , their first- and second - order moments in the gaussian case ) .",
    "the next step is therefore to find a lower bound to the key rate by minimizing over all the degrees of freedom associated with eve s dilation once a small set of accessible parameters has been fixed in alice and bob s shared state ( by `` accessible '' we mean always computable from alice and bob s shared data ) . in cv - mdi - qkd , this small set is given by the transmissivities of the two links and the overall excess noise ( easily computable from the shared data ) . by fixing these parameters ,",

    "are trying to make all their possible arguments against cv - qkd once they realised they were not able to approach the rate of cv - mdi - qkd .",
    "our reply : * no , we do not agree with their main point , and we are not contradicting our nature photonics paper  @xcite*. xu et al .",
    "are clearly mis - quoting us . as already explained before , the rate of cv - mdi - qkd with practical devices and parameters is at least three orders - of - magnitude higher than that of dv - mdi - qkd with corresponding practical devices and parameters  @xcite .",
    "the cv - rate also keeps an advantage of between two and three orders - of - magnitude with respect to the optimal realistic implementation of dv - mdi - qkd with the best available semiconductor single - photon detectors .",
    "this advantage is quantified in terms of bits per relay use and evaluated for various values ( in dbs ) of the channel loss .",
    "that being said , the theoretical possibility of using dv - mdi - qkd with cryogenic devices ( snspds ) currently seems : unnecessarily complex and very expensive ; hard to miniaturise ; not extendable to more complex networks ( e.g. , where each node may act as a user or as a relay ) ; not extendable to mobile devices ( which can be hot - spots as well ) ; very fragile with respect to the performances of the snspds , easily losing one - two orders of magnitude from @xmath120 to @xmath121 efficiencies .",
    "most importantly , better performances could be achieved with practical implementations of cv - mdi - qkd with cheap and room - temperature devices .",

    "our reply : despite the fact that ours is a proof - of - principle experiment in free space at @xmath14  nm , it gives a clear indication of the potential performances of the cv - mdi - qkd protocol in a fibre - based telecom - wavelength implementation , where highly efficient homodyne detectors are available at @xmath122  nm and fibre - couplings are not an issue .",

    "( a )  as already explained in point ( ii ) of the main text , finite - size effects support our experimental results in the sense that these analyses tend to the asymptotic limit for blocks of @xmath33 data points , which is the size considered in our  experiment  @xcite . despite the fact that the theoretical rate is asymptotic , there is no reason to believe that it would be sensibly affected by finite - size analyses . here",
    "the main argument of xu et al .",
    "is that composability security for coherent - state protocols against coherent attack has not yet proven to converge quickly to the asymptotic analysis .",

    "( b )  homodyne detectors have high efficiencies ( well above 85% ) both at optical and telecom wavelengths , free - space or coupled to fibre .",
    "this is typical and already explained above .",

    "our proof - of - principle experiment is a properly - designed  free - space qkd experiment , which provides clear indications of the full potentialities of the protocol in a future field implementation with fibre connections at telecom wavelengths , as already discussed in point @xmath124 above . in particular :    ( a )  about the single laser : as already explained before , the malicious manipulation of the local oscillator can be overcome with practical experimental techniques  @xcite .",

    "@xmath127  km ( as is in our case ) , the excess noise can actually go below these values , which means that our experimental value @xmath3 can even be considered relatively high .",
    "the robustness of cv - mdi - qkd against excess noise can also be appreciated from the analysis done in the supplementary section ie6 of  @xcite ( in particular , see fig .  5 there ) , where the security thresholds are proven to be robust against much higher excess noise ( @xmath10 @xmath11 ) . even assuming the numbers given by xu et al .",

    "alice just needs to connect to the closest ( untrusted ) node available to secretly communicate with a remote ( authenticated )  bob .      at the end of their addendum  xu et al .",
    "make some final remarks .",
    "some of these are completely secondary issues , others are just repetitions of previous points which have been already addressed or refuted , especially the reiterated points on the finite - size effects , the use of a single laser , and the homodyne detectors . we note that xu et al .",
    "misunderstood in which sense our theoretical rate is optimal , thinking that it would be a sort of upper bound .",
    "the optimality is clearly intended as a minimization over all possible attacks which therefore qualifies the key rate as a lower bound ",
