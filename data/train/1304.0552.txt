    "given a @xmath0-regular rooted tree , attach to each edge @xmath2 a random variable @xmath3 , such that the variables are independent and identically distributed . for a vertex @xmath4 in the tree , denote by @xmath5 the sum of the variables @xmath3 over all edges @xmath2 on the path from the root to @xmath4 .",
    "this defines a branching random walk , a basic model for a disordered tree .",
    "it is natural to ask for an efficient algorithm which explores the vertices of this tree in order to find vertices @xmath4 with a large value of @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , aldous @xcite proposed this problem as a benchmark problem for comparing different generic optimization algorithms , since the nave approach , which would be to simply explore all vertices down to the level @xmath7 in the tree and taking the one with the maximal value of @xmath5 , is a bad choice for an algorithm because the number of vertices grows exponentially in @xmath7 .",
    "the metropolis algorithm is a general recipe for constructing a discrete - time markov chain on a finite state space for which a given distribution @xmath9 is stationary and whose transitions respect a given graph structure of the state space . in the context of the comparison of algorithms discussed earlier ,",
    "aldous @xcite suggested using the metropolis algorithm to `` sample '' a certain gibbs measure on the vertices of a branching random walk tree , namely the one which assigns mass @xmath10 to a vertex  @xmath4 , for some parameter @xmath11 . in the case where this measure is infinite , for example",
    "when there is an infinite number of vertices @xmath4 with @xmath12 , this algorithm should `` walk down the tree '' and , for an appropriate choice of the parameter  @xmath13 , find vertices @xmath4 with high values of @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath14 denote the level of the vertex @xmath4 in the tree , and let @xmath15 be the vertex visited by the metropolis algorithm at the time  @xmath16 .",
    "aldous raised the following natural question : if the maximum of the branching random walk has positive speed , that is , if @xmath17 , does there exist a choice of the parameter @xmath13 , such that @xmath18 ? we will answer this question in the affirmative for a certain class of laws of the variables @xmath3 , including the binomial distribution .",
    "in fact , we show more : let @xmath19 , which exists almost surely  @xcite .",
    "we show that there exists a parameter @xmath20 , such that @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the asymptotic variance of @xmath24 , which we show to be positive and finite .",
    "this result was conjectured by aldous , who gave heuristic arguments and numerical evidence for it [ in the case where the variables @xmath3 only take the values @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "results of this type are also known as _ einstein relations _ in the domain of random walks in random environments and our methods of proof will indeed rely on many techniques from this field , some of which have been obtained recently .",
    "we are given a @xmath0-regular infinite rooted tree , @xmath27 .",
    "the root is denoted by @xmath28 and the level / depth of a vertex @xmath4 in the tree by @xmath14 .",
    "the notation @xmath29 denotes that @xmath30 and @xmath4 are connected by an edge .",
    "the parent of a vertex @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath31 ( with the convention @xmath32 ) .",
    "we write @xmath33 if @xmath30 is an ancestor of @xmath4 and @xmath34 if @xmath33 but @xmath35 .",
    "we furthermore use the following handy notation : if @xmath33 , then @xmath36 $ ] denotes the set of vertices on the path from @xmath30 to @xmath4 , including @xmath30 and @xmath4 . the notation @xmath37 $ ] , @xmath38 and @xmath39 then has obvious meaning .",
    "to each edge @xmath40 , we then attach a random variable @xmath3 , such that the collection @xmath41 ) is i.i.d . according to the law of a random variable @xmath42 . here ,",
    "orientation of the edges matters , and we will set @xmath43 for all  @xmath4 .    in what follows , we will introduce several assumptions , _ which we assume to hold throughout the paper_. we begin with the following assumptions on the law of  @xmath42 .",
    "the law of @xmath42 is of compact support , that is , @xmath44 .",
    "there exists @xmath20 , such that @xmath45=e[f(-x)]$ ] for all bounded measurable functions @xmath46 .",

    "note that ( xr ) is equivalent to the laplace transform @xmath49 $ ] being symmetric around @xmath50 . in particular",
    ", the constant @xmath51 is necessarily unique unless @xmath52 almost surely .",
    "an example for a law satisfying ( xs ) , ( xr ) and ( xm ) is the distribution of @xmath53 , where @xmath54 follows a binomial distribution of parameters @xmath7 and @xmath55 , with @xmath56 , where @xmath57 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath58 . in general",
    ", in order to construct a law satisfying ( xs ) and ( xr ) , one can start from a symmetric random variable @xmath42 taking values in a compact interval @xmath59 $ ] and define a law with radon  nikodym derivative proportional to @xmath60 with respect to the law of @xmath42 .",
    "this law will then satisfy ( xm ) for @xmath51 small enough .",
    "we remark that assumption ( xs ) seems not to be crucial , and the argument extends to certain distributions with non compact support , at the cost of more complicated technical arguments . to avoid this complication we chose to present the result under this simplifying assumption . on the other hand , assumption ( xr ) is essential for our treatment , as it ensures , at @xmath51 , the reversibility of the markov chain consisting of the environment viewed from the point of view of the particle ; see proposition  [ prop : rev_erg ] .",
    "the reversibility will be crucial both in the application of the kipnis  varadhan theory , as well as in the proof of validity of the einstein relation ( one may expect a correction term for non reversible chains ) .",
    "we now define the branching random walk by @xmath61 } x({\\vec}u , u),\\qquad s ( \\root ) = 0.\\ ] ] note that @xmath62 for every two vertices @xmath30 and @xmath4 with @xmath29 , by the above convention that @xmath63 .",
    "since @xmath64 is the log - laplace transform of this branching random walk , it is known @xcite that @xmath65 exists and is positive under assumption ( xm ) .",
    "note further that assumptions ( xm ) and ( xr ) together imply that @xmath66 for all @xmath67 , such that @xmath68 exists and is negative @xcite .    in order to define the metropolis algorithm ,",
    "we are given a function @xmath69 satisfying the following conditions [ examples are @xmath70 and @xmath71 :    @xmath72 takes values in @xmath73 $ ] , is nondecreasing and satisfies @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",

    "it satisfies the functional equation @xmath77 for all @xmath78 .    for a given realization of the branching random walk and a parameter @xmath67",
    ", the metropolis algorithm is then the markov chain @xmath79 on the vertices of the tree with the transition probabilities @xmath80 given by @xmath81 we denote the ( annealed , i.e. , averaged over the environment ) law of the metropolis algorithm on the branching random walk tree by @xmath82 and expectation with respect to this law by @xmath83 .",
    "our main theorem is the following :    [ th : einstein ] set @xmath84 .",
    "the limit @xmath85 exists @xmath86-almost surely and is a strictly positive and finite constant .    for each @xmath67 , the deterministic limit",
    "@xmath87 exists @xmath82-almost surely and satisfies @xmath88    we note that the existence of @xmath89 and the fact that it vanishes at @xmath90 were already shown in @xcite ( in a slightly more restrictive setup ) .",
    "the main novelty in theorem  [ th : einstein ] is the proof of the einstein relation ( [ eq - einsteinfinal ] ) , as well as the fact that the right side is strictly positive .      our main inspiration ,",
    "as noted above , is aldous s work  @xcite . in that paper ,",
    "aldous makes the crucial observation that a reversible invariant measure for the environment viewed from the point of view of the particle exists at @xmath90 , and derives from this that @xmath91 , and the existence of the limit @xmath23 under @xmath86 ; he also completely analyzes a greedy algorithm and formulates a series of conjectures , some answered here . in the same paper",
    ", aldous also refers speculatively to @xcite as relevant to the analysis near @xmath90 ; indeed , the approach of the latter to proofs of the einstein relation forms the basis of the current paper , as well to recent advances in the analysis of the einstein relation for disordered systems , as we now discuss .",
    "the einstein relation ( er ) links the asymptotic variance of additive functionals of ( reversible ) markov chains in equilibrium to the chains response to small perturbations . in a weak limit ( where the time - scale is related to the strength of the perturbation ) , lebowitz and rost @xcite provide a general recipe ( based on the kipnis  varadhan theory , see @xcite for a comprehensive account ) for the validity of a weak form of the er in disordered systems .",
    "for the tagged particle in the symmetric exclusion process , the er was proved by loulakis in @xmath27 @xcite by perturbative methods ( using transience in an essential way ) ; this approach was adapted to bond diffusion in @xmath92 in special environment distributions @xcite . for mixing dynamical random environments with spectral gap ,",
    "a full perturbation expansion was proved in @xcite .",
    "significant recent progress was achieved by @xcite , where the lebowitz ",
    "rost approach was combined with good _ uniform in the environment _ estimates on certain regeneration times in the transient regime , that are used to pass from a weak er to a full er . these uniform estimates are typically not available for random walks on ( random ) trees , and a completely different approach , based on explicit recursions , was taken in @xcite , where ( biased ) random walks on galton  watson trees were analyzed .",
    "while we still consider walks on trees , the approach we take is closer to that of @xcite , while replacing their uniform regeneration estimates with probabilistic estimates , in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for another approach to the proof of the er in the context of balanced random walks .      as mentioned above , the starting point is aldous s observation that under @xmath86 , the environment viewed from the point of view of the particle forms a _",
    "reversible _ markov chain .",
    "we begin by proving this ( proposition  [ prop : rev_erg ] ) , and then apply the kipnis  varadhan theory to deduce an invariance principle for anti - symmetric additive functionals ( lemma  [ lem : antisym ] ) .",
    "this allows us to prove the weak er , theorem  [ th : weak_er ] , following the lebowitz  rost recipe .    to handle the perturbation ,",
    "estimates on regeneration times and distances are crucial .",
    "we work with _ level _ regeneration times that are introduced in section  [ sec - reg ] ; these involve the random walk location @xmath93 , not the vertices values @xmath94 ; of course , the latter influence the transition probabilities of the random walk . in order to transform the weak er to a full er , we need uniform bounds on the moments of the regeneration times .",
    "these are obtained in proposition  [ prop : tau_moments ] , where it is proved that the regeneration times exhibit uniform annealed stretched - exponential bounds .",
    "the proof has two main steps : first , exponential moments are proved for regeneration _",
    "distances _ , using in a crucial way a structure lemma of grimmett and kesten ; see lemma  [ lem : excursion_tail ] . then , the estimates for regeneration times are obtained , using that the walk must visit many well - separated fresh vertices , and between two such visits , the walk has a large enough probability to hit distant levels . in proving the last statement , an argument of aidkon @xcite",
    "is used ; see lemma  [ lem : fresh ] .",
    "in this section , we show that the einstein relation holds for times of the order of @xmath95 specifically , we will prove the following result :    [ th : weak_er ] @xmath96=0 $ ] for all @xmath97 .",
