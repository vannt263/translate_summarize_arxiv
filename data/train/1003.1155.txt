    "the inverse power - law distributions , autocorrelations and spectra of the signals , including @xmath1 noise ( also known as @xmath1 fluctuations , flicker noise and pink noise ) , as well as scaling behavior in general , are ubiquitous in physics and in many other fields , counting natural phenomena , spatial repartition of faults in geology , human activities such as traffic in computer networks and financial markets .",
    "this subject is a hot research topic for many decades ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references herein ) .",
    "an up - to - date bibliographic list on @xmath1 noise of more than 1300 papers is composed by wentian li @xcite .",
    "widespread occurrence of signals exhibiting such a behavior suggests that a generic , at least mathematical explanation of the power - law distributions might exist . note that the origins of two popular noises , i.e. , the white noise  no correlation in time , the power spectrum @xmath2 , and integral of the white noise  the brownian noise ( wiener process ) , no correlation between increments , the power spectrum @xmath3 , are very well known and understood . @xmath0 noise with @xmath4 , however , can not be realized and explained in a similar manner and , therefore , no generally recognized explanation of the ubiquity of @xmath1 noise is still proposed .    despite numerous models and theories proposed since its discovery more than 80 years ago @xcite , the intrinsic origin of @xmath1",
    "noise still remains an open question .",
    "although in recent years it is annually published about 100 papers with the phrases ` @xmath1 noise ' , ` @xmath1 fluctuations ' or ` flicker noise ' in the title , there is no conventional picture of the phenomenon and the mechanisms leading to @xmath1 fluctuations are not often clear .",
    "most of the models and theories have restricted validity because of the assumptions specific to the problem under consideration .",
    "categorization and summary of the contemporary stage of theories and models of @xmath1 noise are rather problematic : on one hand , due to the abundance and variety of the proposed approaches , and on the other hand , for the absence of the recent comprehensive review of the wide - ranging `` problem of @xmath1 noise '' and because of the lack of a survey summarizing the current theories and models of @xmath1 noise .",
    "we can cite only a pedagogical review of @xmath1 noise subject by milotti @xcite .",
    "wentian li presents some kind of classification by the categories of publications related with 1/f noise until 2007 @xcite . in the peer - reviewed encyclopedia scholarpedia ,",
    "@xcite there is also a short current review on the subject under the consideration .",
    "thus , we present here only a short and partial categorization of @xmath1 noise models with the restricted list of references .    until recently , probably the most general and common models , theories and explanations of @xmath1 noise have been based on some formal mathematical description such as fractional brownian motion , half - integral of the white noise or some algorithms for generation of signals with the scaled properties @xcite and popular modeling of @xmath1 noise as the superposition of independent elementary processes with the lorentzian spectra and proper distribution of relaxation times , e.g. , @xmath5 distribution @xcite .",
    "the weakness of the later approach is that the simulation of @xmath0 noise with the desirable slope @xmath6 requires finding the special distributions of parameters of the system under consideration , at least a wide range of relaxation time constant should be assumed in order to correlate with the experiments ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "models of @xmath1 noise in some particular systems are usually specific and do not explain the omnipresence of processes with @xmath0 spectrum . predominantly @xmath1 noise problem has been analyzed in conducting media , semiconductors , metals , electronic devices and other electronic systems @xcite .",
    "the topic of @xmath1 noise in such systems has been comprehensively reviewed @xcite , even recently @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , despite numerous suggested models , the origin of flicker noise even there still remains an open issue : `` more and more studies suggest that if there is a common regime for the low frequency noise , it must be mathematical rather than the physical one '' @xcite .",
    "here we can additionaly mention the disputed quantum theory @xcite of @xmath1 noise and satisfactorily interpreted @xmath1 noise in quantum chaos @xcite .    in 1987 bak , tang , and",
    "wiesenfeld @xcite introduced the notion of self - organized criticality ( soc ) with one of the main motivation to explain the universality of @xmath1 noise .",
    "soc systems are nonequilibrium systems driven by their own dynamics to a self - organization .",
    "fluctuations around this state , the so - called avalanches , are characterized by the power - law distributions in time and space , criticality implying long - range correlations .",
    "the distributions of avalanche sizes , durations and energies are all seen to be power laws .",
    "two types of correlations should be distinguished in soc : the scale - free distribution of their avalanche sizes and temporal correlations between avalanches , bursts or ( rare , extreme ) events . in the standard soc models",
    "the search of @xmath0 noise is based on the observable power - law dependence of the burst size as a function of the burst duration and the power - law distribution of the burst sizes , with the poisson distributed interevent times .",
    "such power - laws usually result in the relatively high - frequency power - law , @xmath0 , behavior of the power spectrum with the exponent @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this mechanism of the power - law spectrum is related to the statistical models of @xmath0 noise representing signals as consisting of different random pulses @xcite .",
    "it should also be mentioned that originally soc has been suggested as an explanation of the occurrence of 1/f noise and fractal pattern formation in the dynamical evolution of certain systems .",
    "however , recent research has revealed that the connection between these and soc is rather loose @xcite .",
    "though an explanation of @xmath1 noise was one of the main motivations for the initial proposal of soc , time dependent properties of self - organized critical systems had not been studied much theoretically so far @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to note , that paper @xcite is the most cited paper in the field of @xmath1 noise problem , but it has been shown later on @xcite that the proposed in ref @xcite mechanism in soc systems results in @xmath0 fluctuations with @xmath8 and does not explain the omnipresence of @xmath1 noise .",
    "on the other hand , we can point a recent paper @xcite where an example of @xmath1 noise in the classical sandpile model has been provided .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that another mechanism of @xmath0 noise , based on the temporal correlations between avalanches , bursts or ( rare , extreme ) events , may be the source of the power - law @xmath0 spectra with @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "moreover , soc is closely related with the observable @xmath0 crackling noise @xcite , barkhausen noise @xcite , fluctuations of the long - term correlated seismic events @xcite and @xmath0 fluctuations at non - equilibrium phase transitions @xcite .",
    "ten years ago we proposed @xcite , analyzed @xcite and later on generalized @xcite a simple point process model of @xmath0 noise and applied it for the financial systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , starting from the point process model we derived the stochastic nonlinear differential equations , i.e. , the general langevin equations with a multiplicative noise for the signal intensity exhibiting @xmath0 noise ( with @xmath10 ) in any desirable wide range of frequency @xmath11 @xcite . here",
    "we analyze the scaling properties of the signals generated by the particular stochastic differential equations .",
    "we obtain and analyze the power - law dependencies of the signal intensity , power spectrum , autocorrelation functions and the second order structural functions . the comparison with the numerical simulations",
    "is presented .",
    "moreover , the numerical analysis reveals the second ( reminder , that we start from the point process ) structure of the signal composed of peaks , bursts , clusters of the events with the power - law distributed burst sizes @xmath12 , burst durations @xmath13 and the inter - burst time @xmath14 , while the burst sizes are approximately proportional to the squared durations of the bursts , @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , the proposed nonlinear stochastic model may simulate soc and other similar systems where the processes consist of avalanches , bursts or clustering of the extreme events @xcite .",
    "we start from the point process , @xmath16 representing the signal , current , flow , etc , @xmath17 , as a sequence of correlated pulses or series of events . here",
    "@xmath18 is the dirac @xmath19-function and @xmath20 is a contribution to the signal @xmath17 of one pulse at the time moment @xmath21 .",
    "our model is based on the generic multiplicative process for the interevent time @xmath22 , @xmath23 generating the power - law distributed , @xmath24 sequence of the interevent times @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "some motivations for equation were given on papers @xcite .",
    "additional comments are presented below , after equation .",
    "therefore , in our model the ( average ) interevent time @xmath25 fluctuates due to the random perturbations by a sequence of uncorrelated normally distributed random variables @xmath26 with zero expectation and unit variance , @xmath27 is the standard deviation of the white noise and @xmath28 is a coefficient of the nonlinear damping .",
    "transition from the occurrence number @xmath29 to the actual time @xmath30 in equation according to the relation @xmath31 yields the it stochastic differential equation for the variable @xmath32 as a function of the actual time , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a standard wiener process .",
    "equation generates the stochastic variable @xmath35 , power - law distributed , @xmath36 in the actual time @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath37 is the average interevent time .",
    "@xmath32 may be interpreted as the average time - dependent interevent time of the modulated poisson - like process with the distribution of the interevent time @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the time dependent rate of the process @xcite .",
    "additional support for the stochastic model  of the scaled processes and @xmath0 noise is the following .",
    "the fluctuations of the intensity of the signals , currents , flows , etc , consisting of the discrete objects ( electrons , photons , packets , vehicles , pulses , events , etc ) are primarily and basically defined by fluctuations of the ( average ) interevent , interpulse , interarrival , recurrence , or waiting time . equation is a special case of the general non - linear langevin equation @xmath40 with the drift coefficient @xmath41 and a multiplicative noise @xmath42 for the ( average ) interevent time @xmath32 , with @xmath43 being a white nose defined from the relation @xmath44 .",
    "equation is a straight analogy of the well - known langevin equation for the continuous random variable @xmath45 . for the process consisting of the discrete objects",
    "the intensity of the signal fluctuates due to fluctuations of the rate , i.e. , density of the objects in the time axis , which is a consequence of fluctuations of the interarrival or interevent time .",
    "equation in reality represents ( in the simplest form ) such fluctuations due to random perturbations by white noise .    in papers @xcite",
    "it has been shown that the small interevent times and clustering of the events make the greatest contribution to @xmath0 noise , low frequency fluctuations and exhibition of the long - range scaled features .",
    "therefore , it is straight to approximate the non - linear diffusion coefficient @xmath46 and the distribution of the interevent time @xmath47 in some interval of small interevent times @xmath35 by the power - law dependences or expensions , @xmath48@xmath49    the power - law distribution of the interevent , recurrence , or waiting time is observable in different systems from physics and seismology to the internet , financial markets and neural spikes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that the multiplicative equations with the drift coefficient @xmath41 proportional to the stratonovich correction for the drift , leading the transformation from the stratonovich to the it stochastic differential equation @xcite , i.e. , when @xmath50 with the power - law depending , like , diffusion coefficient @xmath46 , generates the power - law distribution of the stochastic variable .",
    "equations and are definitely of such kind .",
    "therefore , equation is one of the simplest multiplicative equations for the interevent time , modeling scaled processes , while equation ( 2 ) is just the lowest order difference equation following from equation when the step of integration @xmath51 equals the interevent time @xmath25 .    the it transformation in equation of the variable from @xmath35 to the averaged over the time interval @xmath35 intensity of the signal @xmath52 @xcite yields the class of it stochastic differential equations @xmath53 for the signal as function of the scaled time @xmath54 here the new parameters @xmath55 have been introduced .",
    "the fokker - plank equation associated with equation gives the power - law distribution density of the signal intensity @xmath56 with the exponent @xmath57 .    for @xmath58 distribution",
    "diverge as @xmath59 , and , therefore , the diffusion of @xmath45 should be restricted at least from the side of small values , or equation should be modified .",
    "thus , further we will consider the modified equation for @xmath60 only , @xmath61 with the additional small parameter @xmath62 restricting the divergence of the power - law distribution of @xmath45 at @xmath63 .",
    "equation for small @xmath64 represents the linear additive stochastic process generating the brownian motion with the steady drift , while for @xmath65 it reduces to the multiplicative equation .",
    "the fokker - plank equation associated with equation gives the steady - state solution for distribution of @xmath45 , @xmath66 we can obtain the power spectral density of the signal generated by equation from equation ( 28 ) derived in paper @xcite . after some algebra we can write @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 . note that the frequency @xmath11 in equation is the scaled frequency matching the scaled time @xmath73 .",
    "the autocorrelation function @xmath74 of the process can be expressed according to wiener - khinchin theorem as the inverse fourier transform of the power spectrum , @xmath75    a pure @xmath0 power spectrum is physically impossible because of the total power would be infinity . depending on whether @xmath6 is greater or less than one it is necessary to introduce a low frequency cutoff @xmath76 or a high frequency cutoff @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "for calculation of the autocorrelation function according to equation when @xmath78 it is not necessary to introduce the hight frequency cutoff .",
    "usually one introduces a discontinuous transition to the flat spectrum at the lower cutoff @xmath76 @xcite . here at low frequencies we will insert the smooth transition to the flat spectrum in the vicinity of @xmath79 , i.e.",
    ", we will approximate the power spectrum as @xmath80 inserting into equation we obtain @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the modified bessel function , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",

    "the exponent @xmath107 is associated with the scaling of the second order structural function , or height - height correlation function @xcite @xmath109 the exponent @xmath107 characterizes the power - law diffusion rate , as well .",
