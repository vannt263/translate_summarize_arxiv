    "in the last two decades significant advances have taken place in the realm of computational scattering with notable theoretical as well as practical contributions in the domains of finite elements @xcite and integral equations @xcite . however , simulation strategies based upon the former are usually restricted to low and mid frequency applications .",
    "indeed , use of finite element methods in exterior scattering simulations requires not only utilization of an artificial interface to truncate the infinite computational domain but also introduction of appropriate absorbing boundary conditions on this interface to effectively replicate the behaviour of solution at infinity @xcite .",
    "this , in return , renders finite - element methods impractical in high - frequency applications and may result in a loss of accuracy and increased computational cost .",
    "moreover , this difficulty is further amplified on models involving multiple scatterers , such as the one treated in the present paper , because the distance that separates the obstacles naturally increases the size of the truncated domain .",
    "integral equation methods , in contrast , are more adequate for these situations since , on the one hand , they explicitly enforce the radiation condition by simply choosing an appropriate _ outgoing _ fundamental solution and , on the other hand , they are solely based on the knowledge of solution confined only to the scatterers which , in surface scattering applications , provides a dimensional reduction in computational domain @xcite . nevertheless , they deliver dense linear systems whose sizes increase in proportion to @xmath0 with increasing wavenumber @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the dimension of the computational manifold .",
    "broadly speaking , the success of integral equation approaches in high - frequency simulations is directly linked with the incorporation of asymptotic characteristics of the unknown into the solution strategy .",
    "this is essentially the path we follow in this manuscript , since it transforms the problem into the determination of a new unknown whose oscillations are virtually independent of frequency . while pioneering work in this direction is due to nedlc et al .",
    "@xcite who , in two - dimensional simulations , have provided a reduction from @xmath3 to @xmath4 in the number of degrees of freedom needed to obtain a prescribed accuracy , the single - scattering algorithm of bruno et al .",
    "@xcite ( based on a combination of nystr \" om method , extensions of the method of stationary phase , and a change of variables around the shadow boundaries ) has had a significant impact as it has demonstrated the possibility of @xmath5 solution of surface scattering problems ( see @xcite for a three - dimensional variant ) .",
    "alternative implementations of this approach built on a collocation and geometrical theory of diffraction combo @xcite , a collocation and steepest descent amalgamation @xcite , and a p - version galerkin interpretation @xcite have later appeared . in this latter",
    "setting , ecevit et al .",
    "@xcite have recently developed a rigorous method which demands , for any convex scatterer , an increase of @xmath6 ( for any @xmath7 ) in the number of degrees of freedom to maintain a prescribed accuracy independent of frequency .",
    "the single - scattering algorithm @xcite has been successfully extended by bruno et al .",
    "@xcite to encompass the high - frequency multiple - scattering problems considered in this paper , relating specifically to a finite collection of convex obstacles .",
    "roughly speaking , the approach in @xcite was based on : 1 ) representation of the overall solution as an infinite superposition of single scattering effects through use of a neumann series , 2 ) determination of the phase associated with each one of these effects using a spectral geometrical optics solver , and 3 ) utilization of the high - frequency single scattering algorithm @xcite for the frequency independent evaluation of these effects . while every numerical implementation in @xcite has displayed the spectral convergence of neumann series for two convex obstacles , unfortunately , a rigorous proof of this fact was not available .",
    "indeed , we have later shown for several convex obstacles in both two-  @xcite and three - dimensional  @xcite settings that the neumann series can be rearranged into contributions associated with _ primitive periodic orbits _ and an explicit rate of convergence formula can be rigorously derived on each periodic orbit in the high - frequency regime . while , on the one hand , these analyses depict the convergence of neumann series for all sufficiently large wavenumbers @xmath1 , on the other hand , the rate of convergence formulas display that convergence can be rather slow particularly when ( at least ) one pair of nearby obstacles exists .",
    "this analysis of the rate convergence @xcite was performed by using _",
    "double layer _ potentials . in this work ,",
    "we show that use of _ combined field integral equations _",
    "lead to the same rate of convergence . accordingly , novel mechanisms are much needed for the accelerated solution of multiple scattering problems that retain the frequency independent operation count underlying the algorithm in @xcite . however , this is a rather challenging task since the algorithm in @xcite undeviatingly rests on reducing the problem , at each iteration , to the computation of an unknown with a single - valued phase , and thus any strategy aimed at accelerating the convergence of neumann series must also preserve the phase information related with the iterates .    in this paper , we develop a krylov subspace method that significantly accelerates the convergence of neumann series , in particular in the case where the distance between obstacles decreases hence deteriorating the rate of convergence .",
    "this method is well adapted to the high frequency aspect of the present problem as it retains the phase information associated with the iterates and delivers highly accurate solutions in a small number of iterations .",
    "note specifically that a direct implementation of krylov subspace methods inhibits the use of the algorithm in @xcite as this makes it impossible to track the phase information of the corresponding iterates .",
    "as we shall see , a natural attempt to overcome this issue would be to simply use the binomial formula , however , this disrupts the convergence of the method as displayed in the numerical results .",
    "we defeat this additional difficulty by introducing an alternative numerically stable decomposition of the iterates . in summary ,",
    "our approach is based on three main elements : 1 ) utilization of an appropriate formulation of the multiple scattering problem in the form of an operator equation of the second kind , 2 ) alternative representation of the associated krylov subspaces so as to guarantee that basis elements are single - phased and thus retain the frequency independent operation count underlying the algorithm in @xcite , and 3 ) a novel decomposition of the iterates entering in a ( standard ) krylov recursion to prevent instabilities that would otherwise arise in a typical implementation based on binomial identity .",
    "indeed , as depicted in our numerical implementations , the resulting methodology is immune to numerical instabilities as it removes the additive cancellations arising from a direct use of binomial theorem .",
    "moreover , it provides additional savings in the number of needed iterations when compared with the classical pad approximants used in @xcite .",
    "we additionally complement our krylov subspace approach utilizing a preconditioner based upon kirchhoff approximations to further reduce the number of iterations needed to obtain a given accuracy .",
    "indeed , since the knowledge of the illuminated regions at each iteration are readily available through the geometrical optics solver we have used to precompute the phase of multiple scattering iterations , essentially the only additional computation needed for the application of this preconditioner is the use of stationary phase method to deal with non - singular integrals wherein the only stationary points are the target ones .",
    "this kind of _ dynamical _ preconditioning is unusual and its originality resides in the fact that the location of illuminated regions varies at each reflection .",
    "this clearly distinguishes our preconditioning strategy from classical approaches where the preconditioners are usually _ steady _ by design .",
    "while the success of this kirchhoff preconditioner is clearly displayed in our numerical tests , the utilization of kirchhoff approximations for the multiple scattering iterations naturally arises the question of convergence of the associated neumann series .",
    "we address this problem by showing that this series converges for each member of a general general class of functions , and explain the exact sense in which the spectral radius of the kirchhoff operator is strictly less than 1 .",
    "the importance of this result is twofold .",
    "first , it verifies that the multiple scattering problem can be solved by using solely the kirchhoff technique , and further it rigorously answers the validity of our preconditioning strategy .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : formulation ] , we introduce the scattering problem and provide a comparison of the equivalent differential and integral equation formulations of multiple scattering problems . ",
    "[ sec : convergence ] is reserved for a comparison of convergence characteristics of these approaches . in  [ sec : freqindep ] , we provide a short review of the algorithm in @xcite as the ideas therein lie at the core of frequency independent evaluation of multiple scattering iterations as well as the iterates associated with our newly proposed krylov subspace method detailed in  [ sec : krylov ] . in  [ sec : kirchhoff ] , we explain how this krylov subspace approach can be preconditioned while utilizing kirchhoff approximations .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : numerical ] , we present numerical implementations validating our newly proposed methodologies .",
    "given an incident field @xmath8 satisfying the helmholtz equation in @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , we consider the solution of sound - soft scattering problem @xmath11 in the exterior of a smooth compact obstacle @xmath12 .",

    "naturally , the convergence analysis carried out in @xcite is directly linked with that of the neumann series and here we present the exact connection .",

    "moreover , it is clear that each realization of the kirchhoff operator @xmath221 is frequency independent .",
    "consequently , the preconditioned equation is amenable to a treatment by the krylov subspace method described in  5 to obtain even more accelerated solutions of the multiple scattering problem while still retaining the frequency independent operation count if desired .",
    "here we present numerical examples that display the benefits of our krylov subspace approach as well as its preconditioning through use of kirchhoff approximations . to this end ,",
    "we have designed two different test configurations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : configurations ] ) .",
    "first we have considered two circles illuminated by a plane - wave incidence coming in from the left with wavenumber @xmath319 . while the radii of the circles are @xmath117 and @xmath320 , they are centered at the origin and @xmath321 respectively .",
    "second we have treated a configuration consisting of two parallel elliptical obstacles with centers at @xmath322 and @xmath323 , and major / minor axes @xmath324 and @xmath325 . the illumination is provided by a plane wave with direction along the major axes and wavenumber @xmath326 .    figure [ fig : krylov ] provides a comparison of ( a ) the neumann series , ( b ) the pad approximants , ( c ) the krylov subspace method based on a combined use of binomial formula and identity , and ( d ) the alternative implementation of the latter based on decomposition leading to equation . more precisely , figure [ fig : krylov ] depicts the number of reflections versus the logarithmic @xmath327 error @xmath328 between the exact solution @xmath20 and the approximations @xmath329 obtained by the four aforementioned schemes . in both cases ,",
    "the reference solution @xmath20 is computed using an integral solver with sufficiently many disretization points to guarantee @xmath330 digits of accuracy .",
    "as we anticipated , combined use of binomial formula and identity suffers from subtractive cancellations and fails to approximate the solution as the number of reflections increases .",
    "the implementation of krylov subspace method based on decomposition and resulting equation clearly resolves this issue .",
    "furthermore , when compared with the pad approximants considered in @xcite , approximations provided by this alternative implementation of the krylov subspace method are more stable and give better accuracy at each iteration .",
    "incidentally , note specifically that a direct use of neumann series would require about @xmath331 iterations to obtain @xmath332 digits of accuracy for circular / elliptical configurations in figure  [ fig : configurations ] , and thus our krylov subspace approach provides savings of @xmath333 in the required number of reflections .",
    "finally , in figure  [ fig : kirchhoff ] , we display a comparison of ( a ) the neumann series , ( b ) the stable implementation of our krylov subspace approach based on decomposition and equation , and ( c ) kirchhoff preconditioning of the latter .",
    "note precisely that ( c ) is based on the krylov subspace iterations ( described in  [ sec : krylov ] ) applied to the truncated version of preconditioned form of the multiple scattering problem utilizing the kirchhoff operator @xmath221 . in our implementations",
    "we have taken @xmath334 in equation and used @xmath335 for the circular / elliptical configurations in figure  [ fig : configurations ] .",
    "as depicted in figure  [ fig : kirchhoff ] , in both cases only three orthodir iterations are sufficient to obtain @xmath336digits of accuracy which would require 20/100 iterations if neumann series is directly used .",
    "the fact that the error does not attain the machine precision is due to the truncation of the series used to compute the preconditioner ( @xmath337 ) .",
    "obviously inclusion of more terms yields better accuracy but at the expense of slightly more expansive numerics .",
    "we have developed an acceleration strategy for the solution of multiple scattering problems based on a novel and effective use of krylov subspace methods that retains the phase information and provides significant savings in computational times .",
    "further , we have coupled this approach with an original preconditioning strategy based upon kirchhoff approximations that greatly reduces the number of iterations needed to obtain a prescribed accuracy . in the forthcoming work",
    ", we will extend this numerical algorithm for configurations of more than two obstacles .",
    "indeed , our new krylov method can be easily applied to this kind of configurations without adding any additional computational cost . on the other hand , although the kirchhoff preconditioner greatly enhances the convergence of the krylov subspace method for two obstacles , its utilization for several obstacles requires some numerical optimization .",
