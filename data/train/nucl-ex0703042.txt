    "the alice experiment will study heavy ion collisions at lhc .",
    "the main tracking detector of the alice experiment is the tpc@xcite .",
    "the aim of the laser system is to generate straight tracks , similar to ionizing particle tracks , at known positions in the drift volume of the tpc .",
    "these tracks are generated by the two - photon ionization of the drift gas by a pulsed uv laser beam with a wavelength of @xmath1 .",
    "other electrons are emitted by photoelectric effect when the laser beam hits metallic surfaces such as the central electrode , the aluminized mylar strips of the electric field cage , or wires and pads of the readout system .",
    "after readout and track reconstruction using the tpc detector , distorsions related to exb effects and mechanical misalignment will be measured and corrected using these tracks .",
    "the spatial and temporal variations of the drift velocity due to the drift field will be measured within a relative error of @xmath2 and used as calibration data in the physics analysis .",
    "the calibration system ( fig . [ principle3d ] ) is composed of a static optical system with a few adjustable parts . the static optics is composed of beam splitters , mirrors and bending prisms guiding the laser beam outside the tpc field cage before it enters the tpc volume .",
    "the guiding system ends with cameras that take pictures of the laser beam in order to monitor the position and the beam intensity .",
    "the adjustable part is mainly composed of remotely adjustable mirrors that will guide the beam into the static optics system . in order to generate multiple tracks in the tpc , the laser beam goes through several steps .",
    "first , a @xmath3 diameter laser beam is divided , at one end , into @xmath4 by beam splitters before it enters the tpc .",
    "each beam enters the tpc in a hollow rod , goes through the central electrode and , for monitoring purposes is detected by a camera located at the far end of the tpc . in each rod ,",
    "@xmath5 micro - mirror bundles , placed at fixed positions along the length of the rod , reflect a part of the laser beam into @xmath6 one - millimeter diameter beams ( 20 - 40 @xmath7j / pulse ) that enter the tpc volume .",
    "a second laser generates similar rays in the second half of the tpc .",
    "thus , on the whole @xmath8 laser beams ( fig .",
    "[ laser - tracks - designed ] ) are created inside the tpc volume@xcite .",
    "a laser from spectron laser systems ltd ( model sl805-upg ) is set up in the laser hut . a second laser from ekspla company@xcite ( model nl313 )",
    "will be set up in the experimental area .",
    "these lasers deliver @xmath1 wavelength pulses of @xmath9 duration at a repetition rate of @xmath10 and the energy of a pulse is @xmath11 at the entrance of the end cap .",
    "each laser device has two rs232 connections for control and monitoring purposes .",
    "they are converted into a tcp / ip connection with an interface from digi international@xcite company in order to be able to control the lasers over long distances .",
    "each laser is controled by c++ serial port drivers included in two separate dim@xcite servers running on windows xp .",
    "the servers communicate with dim clients included in the user interfaces .",
    "the two lasers can be used in parallel , one for each end cap , or one for both end caps , the other one being kept as a backup @xcite .",
    "two adjustable mirrors are used to align the laser beam in the guiding system on the tpc endplates .",
    "they are controlled by new focus@xcite pico - motors .",
    "all pico - motors are controlled by c++ serial port drivers included in a dim server .",
    "the rs232 communication protocol is converted into tcp / ip , with an interface from digi international@xcite company , to be able to control the pico - motors over long distances .",
    "cameras ( up to 16 ) will monitor the laser beams . at each end",
    "cap one camera is placed behind the movable mirror .",
    "two others can be placed at the end of the two @xmath12 bends . moreover , 12 extra cameras are at the end of each rod .",
    "all these cameras will take pictures of the laser beam in order to monitor its intensity and its position .",
    "images are acquired with a frame grabber card ( and an extension card ) from imaging development systems@xcite ( ids ) , model falcon - quattro .",
    "an electronic board will synchronize laser pulses and cameras with the lhc clock .",
    "this board was developed for the detector control system of the tpc and trd detector in alice@xcite .",
    "the tpc laser detector control system ( fig . [ dcs - schema ] ) is used to control and monitor the laser beams from the control room while sending pulses through the alice tpc .",
    "images of the laser spots recorded by cameras will be processed in order to move adjustable mirrors to align laser beams inside the rods .",
    "the dcs board will be configured to synchronize the laser pulse emission and the image capture ( by cameras and frame grabber cards ) with the lhc clock .",
    "all sub - systems are controlled by a common supervisory control and data acquisition ( pvss , process visualization and steering system@xcite from etm professional control company ) inside the joint controls project framework@xcite , giving a stable user interface .",
    "the tpc reconstruction software was tested and optimized on simulated laser events , where the straight laser tracks in the tpc detector were approximated by high transverse momentum muons emitted from the micro - mirrors , using the aliroot@xcite framework .",
    "the reconstruction algorithms of the tpc tracks were used to reconstruct the simulated muons .",
    "last summer , data was recorded in two opposite sectors at the same time during the tpc commissioning . while the data analysis is still going on , preliminary results on the reconstructed laser tracks ( fig . [ reco - laser ] ) are in agreement with the simulated tracks .",
    "the alice tpc has been commissioned with both cosmic muon tracks and straight track events generated by the laser system .",
    "further data analysis will make it possible to study and correct for chamber alignment and drift distortion effects before the installation of the tpc in the alice experiment .",
    "a second laser and the full detector control system will be installed in the next months and will be used to monitor and correct distortions for the duration of the alice experiment .",
