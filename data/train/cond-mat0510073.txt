    "the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope@xcite in 1981 and a consequent development in the beginning of the nineties of the remarkably simple experimental technique known as mechanically controllable break junction ( mcbj)@xcite led to the possibility of fabrication of metallic point contacts approaching the atomic scale .",
    "the recent review article ( ref .  ) summarizes the numerous achievements in this field . in the experiments the conductance measured as a function of the elongation of the nanocontacts decreases in a stepwise fashion @xcite with steps of order of the conductance quantum @xmath0",
    ". such behavior of the conductance is attributed to atomic rearrangements that entails a discrete variation of the contact diameter . @xcite    the electron transport in metallic nanocontacts is purely ballistic and phase - coherent because their size is much smaller than all scattering lengths of the system .",
    "according to landauer,@xcite conductance is understood as transport through nonmixing channels , @xmath1 where @xmath2 s are transmission probabilities .",
    "they are defined as eigenvalues of the transmission matrix @xmath3 . here",
    "the matrix element @xmath4 gives the probability amplitude for an incoming electron wave in the transverse mode ( channel ) @xmath5 on the left from the contact to be transmitted to the outgoing wave in the mode @xmath6 on the right .",
    "consequently , the eigenvectors of @xmath3 are usually called eigenchannels .",
    "it was shown in the pioneering work by scheer _",
    "et al._@xcite that a study of the current - voltage relation for the superconducting atomic - sized contacts allowed to obtain transmission probabilities @xmath2 s for particular atomic configurations realized in mcbj experiments .",
    "the @xmath2 s are found by fitting theoretical and experimental @xmath7 curve which has a peculiar nonlinear behavior for superconducting contacts at voltages @xmath8 smaller than the energy gap @xmath9 of a superconductor@xcite .",
    "the origin of such effect is explained in terms of multiple andreev reflections.@xcite the analysis of mcbj experiments within the tight - binding ( tb ) model suggested by cuevas _",
    "et al._@xcite gave a strong evidence to the relation between the number of conducting modes and the number of valence orbitals of a contact atom .",
    "to describe the electronic and transport properties of nanocontacts , quite a big number of different methods which supplemented each other were developed during the last 15 years .",
    "early models employed a free - electron - like approximation.@xcite further approaches based on density functional theory ( dft ) used psuedopotentials to describe atomic chains suspended between jellium electrodes.@xcite the tb models were applied to the problem of the conduction eigenchannels@xcite and to the study of the breaking processes of nanowires.@xcite the up - to - date fully self - consistent _ ab initio _",

    "the scattering waves , underlying a concept of eigenchannels introduced by landauer and bttiker,@xcite do not form an appropriate basis for the most of _ ab initio _  methods .",
    "instead , one considers conduction channels as eigenvectors of some hermitian transmission matrix written in terms of local , atom centered basis set.@xcite one of the goals of the present paper is to establish a missing link between these approaches .",
    "below we introduce a formalism for the evaluation of conduction eigenchannels , which combines an _ ab initio _  korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) green s function method@xcite for the electronic structure calculations and the baranger and stone formulation of the ballistic transport@xcite . in recent publications,@xcite",
    "we have successfully applied this method to the study of the electron transport through atomic contacts contaminated by impurities . in the present paper ,",
    "mathematical aspects of the problem are considered , followed by some applications . in particular , we analyze the symmetry of channels and relate our approach to the orbital classification of eigenmodes introduced by cuevas _",

    "iii with a formal definition of eigenchannels for the case of realistic crystalline leads attached to atomic constriction .",
    "iv supplemented by appendices  a and  b contains mathematical formulation of the method . briefly , using the equivalence of the kubo and landauer approaches for the conductance , @xcite we build the transmission matrix @xmath10 in the scattering wave representation .",
    "the angular momentum expansion of the scattering bloch states within each cell is used further to find an equivalent , kkr representation of the transmission operator for which the eigenvalue problem can be solved .",
    "applications of the method are presented in sec .",
    "v. in particular , we focus on transition metal contacts ( such as ni , co and pd ) , since experimental@xcite and theoretical studies @xcite of their transport properties have been attracting much attention during the last years .",
