    "the effect of magnetic impurities on the electron properties of a metal is drastically different from that of `` usual '' defects which just violate the translational invariance of the crystalline lattice .",
    "the reason for the difference is that a magnetic impurity brings an additional degree of freedom ",
    "we demonstrate that magnetic impurities may mediate energy transfer between electrons .",
    "if the transferred energy @xmath0 exceeds the kondo temperature @xmath2 , then the energy relaxation occurs predominantly in two - electron collisions .",
    "we derive the kernel @xmath3 of the collision integral in the kinetic equation for the distribution function .",
    "this kernel depends strongly on the transferred energy , @xmath4 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath3 on the energies @xmath5 of the colliding electrons comes from the logarithmic in @xmath6 renormalization of the exchange integral @xmath7 , known from the theory of kondo effect@xcite , and is relatively weak as long as @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath9 divergence of the kernel is cut off at small @xmath0 ; the cut - off energy is determined by the dynamics of the impurity spins .",
    "localized spins affect not only the energy relaxation rate , but also the conventional electron transport properties , such as the temperature and field dependence of the conductance .",
    "no spin dynamics of impurities is needed for the suppression of the interference corrections to the conductivity ; interaction of electron spins with the magnetic moments `` frozen '' in random directions already leads to that suppression  @xcite .",
    "mesoscopic conductance fluctuations are not suppressed by `` frozen '' magnetic moments . however",
    ", even a relatively slow relaxation ( such as korringa relaxation ) of individual magnetic moments leads to the time - averaging of the random potential `` seen '' by transport electrons in the course of measurement , and the mesoscopic fluctuations of the dc conductance are averaged out.@xcite we find the weak localization correction to the conductivity and the magnitude of conductance fluctuations in the presence of magnetic field of arbitrary strength .",
    "we describe a metal with magnetic impurities by means of the hamiltonian @xmath10 : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the spin operator of the @xmath13-th impurity at point @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",

    "the impurities can be considered independently if their concentration @xmath21 is low enough . in the one - impurity scattering problem ,",
    "there is interaction only in @xmath22 channel , so we will label the participating electron states with scalar index @xmath23 .",
    "the lowest non - vanishing order of the perturbation theory series in the exchange constant @xmath7 for the inelastic scattering amplitude is the second order : @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ inamp ] ) is the energy of the intermediate virtual state , which equals @xmath26 for two of the four possible pairings of the electron creation - annihilation operators , or @xmath27 for the other two pairings .",
    "the spin structure of the scattering amplitude can easily be found from eq .",
    "( [ inamp ] ) . in a scattering event , spins of one or both participating electrons must flip , with the corresponding change of the impurity spin . here",
    "we are interested only in the relaxation of the electron energy distribution , and assume that in the absence of magnetic field the system does not have any spin polarization .",
    "therefore we need to calculate only the total cross - section of scattering into all possible spin states , averaged over the initial spin states of the impurity and two electrons .",
    "we obtain the collision integral kernel @xmath28 which depends only on the energy @xmath0 transferred in the collision . here",
    "@xmath29 is the electron density of states at the fermi energy per spin degree of freedom .    for low energy electrons ,",

    "( [ ke ] ) is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the characteristic energy of electrons participating in the collision and @xmath2 is the kondo temperature .",
    "this approximation is justified as long as the energies @xmath32of all incoming and outgoing electrons satisfy the condition @xmath33 .",
    "it is important to note that energy @xmath31 , which lies within the width of the electron distribution function , does not cut off the singularity in the transferred energy @xmath0 . for a more detailed expression for",

    "the low - energy divergence of the inelastic scattering amplitude ( [ inamp ] ) is cut off by the time evolution of the impurity spin correlator @xmath35 . in magnetic field",
    "@xmath36 this evolution is a spin precession with frequency @xmath37 .",
    "when @xmath38 exceeds the energies of the electrons being scattered , the scattering rate saturates @xcite at @xmath39 the scattering processes in which both initial or both final electrons have the same spin are suppressed completely .",
    "the other mechanism , which cuts off the @xmath40 singularity of the kernel ( [ ke ] ) even at @xmath41 , is the impurity spin relaxation .",
    "this relaxation limits the lifetime of the intermediate state and the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ inamp ] ) acquires the imaginary part . at high temperature @xmath42 scattering of the thermal electrons on the spin results in an exponential decay of the spin correlation function , @xmath43 .",
    "the impurity spin correlation time @xmath44 can be evaluated with the help of the fermi golden rule .",
    "if the deviation from the thermal equilibrium is weak , we have @xmath45 here , as @xmath46 is lowered towards @xmath2 , the exchange constant is renormalized according to eq .",

    "the fermi - liquid description of electrons is valid again .",
    "the behavior of the system is described in this case by the quadratic fixed - point hamiltonian , with the four - fermion interaction being the least - irrelevant term.@xcite the calculation of the inelastic scattering rate is then straightforward .",
    "the resulting collision - integral kernel is energy - independent : @xmath51 .",
    "we also discuss the relaxation due to the electron scattering on magnetic impurities in wires with applied bias @xmath52 . in this case",
