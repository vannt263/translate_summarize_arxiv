    "the term `` writhe '' ( or `` writhing number '' ) was first proposed by fuller @xcite for a quantity @xmath0 that arises as a difference between the linking number @xmath1 and the twist ( or `` twisting number '' ) @xmath2 of a closed ribbon in the clugreanu - white - fuller formula @xcite @xmath3 the sense of this very simple - looking and very famous ( is nt the second a consequence of the first ? )",
    "relationship is that the right - hand side , though defined for a ribbon , depends only on its central curve .",
    "since @xmath0 is a characteristic of spatial complexity of a curve , it makes this quantity worth to consider while examining lengthy physical objects .",
    "in particular , the values of @xmath0 have been computed in a number of works for various models of large - scale structure of dnas ( e.g. , @xcite ) as well as for experimental data on these molecules @xcite .",
    "rna tertiary structures and the protein folding are other neighbour areas for an application of the geometrical and topological tools developed in the dna studies @xcite . however , the application of the writhe is confined formally by smoothly closed shapes though quite a lot of interesting objects have their ends not joined ( or joined non - smoothly ) .",
    "one should mention here the studies based on the recently developed experimental techniques of manipulation with single dna molecules @xcite .",
    "the modelling curves require an appropriately defined measure to characterize their arrangement in space .",
    "therefore , it seems to be helpful to generalize the notion of the writhe onto non - closed curves and their fragments .",
    "indeed , such trials ( explicit and implicit ) have been made @xcite . in some cases the definitions of the writhe suggested in different works are not consistent to each other .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a consistent and natural generalization of the notion of writhe to an arbitrary fragment of a curve and to derive explicit formulas for its computation as a function of the arclength .",
    "the basic idea consists in a construction of the closure of the fragment under consideration in such a way that it would correspond to the closure of the tangent indicatrix by an arc of a great circle , as it has been proposed by maggs @xcite . in some sense",
