    "in idealised friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmologies , comoving observers simply follow the universal expansion . in more realistic models , the smooth hubble flow is distorted and matter acquires ` peculiar ' velocities .",
    "the dipolar anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has been traditionally interpreted as the result of our peculiar motion relative to the cosmic rest - frame : the frame that redshifts with the expansion and in which the dipole vanishes .",
    "our local group of galaxies drifts with respect to the cmb frame at roughly 600  km / sec  @xcite .",
    "analogous velocities , but for bulk motions on much larger scales , were also recently reported in the surveys of  @xcite and those of  @xcite .",
    "the latter group , in particular , finds coherent peculiar flows as strong as 1000  km / sec out to scales of 450 and 800  mpc .",
    "both surveys appear in disagreement with the current concordance @xmath0cdm scenario ( e.g.  see  @xcite ) .",
    "this report considers the theoretical implications of such drift velocities for the kinematics of the associated observers by focusing on the scalars that describe their average volume expansion .",
    "the key question is whether observers drifting relative to the cmb and those following the hubble expansion ( in a dust - dominated frw universe ) can ` measure ' different deceleration parameters . whether , in particular , it is theoretically possible for a peculiarly moving observer to ` experience ' accelerated expansion while the universe is decelerating .",
    "we show that , even when the peculiar velocities are relatively small , the answer to this question is positive and explain why .",
    "not surprisingly , we also find that the effects of the peculiar motions are local .",
    "nevertheless , the affected scales can be large enough to give the impression that the universe had recently moved into an accelerating phase .",

    "observers drifting relative to the cmb have expansion rates different than that of the actual universe simply because of their relative motion .",

    "expressed in terms of their volume scalars , the deceleration parameters associated with the @xmath2 and @xmath4 frames are respectively given by @xmath39 our main question is whether @xmath40 can take negative values while @xmath41 is still positive .",

    "we first use definitions ( [ eq : qs1 ] ) to recast expressions ( [ eq : rays1 ] ) into @xmath42 respectively .",
    "these already show that @xmath41 and @xmath40 are generally different , but it helps to relate the two deceleration parameters directly .",

    "note that for simplicity we have used overdots for both time derivatives .",
    "] putting it differently , one could say that measuring negative deceleration parameter in a frame drifting relative to the cmb ( like that of our local group for example ) does not necessarily imply an accelerating universe .",
    "at this point it is worth noting that , according to ( [ eq : qs1]b ) , condition @xmath58 is equivalent to @xmath59 .",
    "this means that both @xmath40 and @xmath60 can be simultaneously negative .",
    "analogous relations also hold between @xmath41 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",

    "the results show bulk velocities as large as 500  km / sec  @xcite and up to 1000  km / sec  @xcite on the corresponding scales . on smaller lengths ( between 30 and 60  mpc )",
    "the work of  @xcite suggests a ( positive ) variance in the local hubble rate up to 10% . with the possible exception of the last survey ,",
    "there is currently no way of knowing whether the reported bulk flows are of the desired type ( i.e.  with @xmath45 ) . nevertheless , in the absence of better data",
    ", we will use the magnitudes of the aforementioned peculiar velocities to infer reasonable ( order - of - magnitude ) estimates for @xmath25 .",
    "in addition , mainly for algebraic simplicity and illustration purposes , we will also consider the intermediate value of 700  km / sec as a yardstick peculiar velocity .",
    "note that this value is very close to the drift velocity of our local group .    setting the hubble parameter at 70  km / secmpc and extrapolating to 50  mpc , 100  mpc and 1000  mpc",
    ", we find that @xmath75 is close to 1/5 , 1/10 and 1/100 respectively . and that @xmath78",
    ". measuring the 3-divergence of the peculiar velocity is not feasible at present .",
    "we can obtain an estimate , however , using the approximate relation @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the magnitude of the bulk velocity in a given region and @xmath81 the size of that region .",
    "then , @xmath82 . ]",
    "then , following condition ( [ eq : con1 ] ) , the tilded observer will ` measure ' negative deceleration parameter within a region of up to 50  mpc ( in an otherwise decelerating universe ) if @xmath83 .",
    "this condition strengthens to @xmath84 at 100  mpc , while further out , near the 1000  mpc mark for instance , @xmath40 will remain positive unless @xmath85 . inserting these numbers into eq .",
    "( [ eq : ltq1 ] ) we obtain a range of values for the deceleration parameter of the tilded observer on the corresponding scales .",
    "thus , provided ( [ eq : con1 ] ) is satisfied , @xmath40 varies within ( -0.4,0 ) on scales of 50  mpc , between ( -0.2,0 ) when we move to 100  mpc and within ( -0.02,0 ) near the 1000  mpc threshold .",
    "so , in this example the size of accelerated region ( i.e.  that of patch ( @xmath66 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : pvel ] ) ranges between 50  mpc and 1000  mpc . within these scales",
    "@xmath40 lies in the ( -0.4,0 ) range , taking its minimum value in small - scale regions of low density and approaching zero as we move on to larger lengths .",
    "these estimates are not far from those inferred by the supernovae data , which value the deceleration parameter close to -0.5 and put the transition to deceleration near @xmath86  @xcite .",

    ", the results of  @xcite suggest that @xmath40 varies the range ( -0.07,0 ) and ( -0.04,0 ) respectively , when @xmath90 and @xmath91 on the corresponding scales .",

    "one should keep in mind , however , that on relatively small scales the peculiar - velocity errorbars are large ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "let us now turn to the last term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tq2 ] ) .",
    "qualitatively speaking , a positive @xmath94 will assist the acceleration , relax the above given conditions and lead to lower values of @xmath40 .",

    "we will also demand that @xmath95 , to ensure that both @xmath25 and @xmath94 are small perturbations relative to their background associates .",
    "the next step is to recast raychaudhuri s formula ( see eq .",

    "( [ eq : tq2 ] ) and employing some straightforward algebra we arrive at @xmath98 using the previous values of @xmath75 , we find that negative @xmath40s on @xmath99  mpc scales need @xmath88 . similarly , expression ( [ eq : ltq2 ] ) translates into @xmath89 close to 100  mpc and into @xmath100 near the 1000  mpc mark , if @xmath40 is to become negative there . under these conditions",
    ", the accelerated patch extends from 50  mpc to 1000  mpc , with @xmath40 varying within ( -0.2,0 ) .",
    "so , even with the last term of ( [ eq : tq2 ] ) accounted for ( and in an unfavourable way ) , negative values for @xmath40 are still possible .",
    "conventional almost - frw kinematics can accommodate accelerated expansion .",
    "to summarise , suppose that in a dust - dominated frw universe a sufficiently large region ( @xmath67 ) is endowed with a weak bulk peculiar velocity of positive divergence ( i.e.  @xmath45 ) .",
    "when the right - hand side of ( [ eq : tq2 ] ) drops below unity , around every point in ( @xmath67 ) there is an essentially spherically symmetric patch ( @xmath66 ) where the expansion is ` weakly ' accelerated ( i.e.  @xmath58 there ) . ) and the observers position in it can induce anisotropy in the spatial distribution of @xmath40 .",
    "generally , the higher the spherical symmetry of ( @xmath67 ) and the closer the observer at the centre the better .",
    "these matters are less of an issue , however , when ( @xmath67 ) is considerably larger than ( @xmath66 ) , namely as long as patch ( @xmath66 ) lies well within region ( @xmath67 ) . the direction of the peculiar motion can also introduce an anisotropy in the @xmath40-distribution .",
    "this effect is maximised when the peculiar velocity maintains the same magnitude and direction throughout the integration period ( i.e.  from @xmath101 to the present  see expression ( [ eq : dl ] ) ) . in the opposite case ,",
    "when the @xmath6-field has been sufficiently randomised , the anisotropy will be negligible .",
    "estimating effects like these is currently impossible , however , as it requires detailed data on the distribution of peculiar velocities within regions of several hundred mpc . ] as a result , nearly every observer in ( @xmath67 ) will experience accelerated expansion , although region ( @xmath67 ) and the universe itself may be actually decelerating .",
    "the accelerating effect , in a given region , depends on the magnitude of the peculiar velocity and the density of the region in question .",
    "overall , the larger the drift velocity and the lower the density the faster the acceleration .",
    "little more than a decade ago , observations of high - redshift supernovae indicated that our universe was expanding at an accelerating pace  @xcite .",
    "this conclusion was reached after applying the observed luminosity distances of the supernovae to the distance - redshift relation , @xmath102}\\mathrm{d}x\\ , ,   \\label{eq : dl}\\ ] ] of an frw model .",
    "note that in the above @xmath41 is the deceleration parameter of the universe and not that of an observer moving relative to the cmb . )",
    ", one should replace @xmath41 with @xmath40 . to linear order in @xmath6 ,",
    "the latter is given by expression ( [ eq : tq2 ] ) , or by its simplified counterpart ( [ eq : ltq1 ] ) . ]",
    "the results have repeatedly given negative values to @xmath41 , indicating an accelerated expansion for our universe .",
    "in particular , the deceleration parameter was estimated close to -0.5 .",
    "the same measurements also suggested that the accelerated phase was a relatively recent event , putting the transition from deceleration to acceleration around @xmath86 ( i.e.  between two and three thousand mpc ",
    "the supernovae results were so unexpected that they have since dominated almost every aspect of contemporary cosmology .",
    "the main problem is that negative values for the deceleration parameter appear theoretically impossible in frw ( as well as in perturbed , almost - frw ) cosmologies , unless new physics or drastic changes to the matter content of the universe were introduced .",
    "dark energy , an unknown and elusive form of matter with negative gravitational mass , has so far been the most popular answer .",
    "the implications of peculiar velocity perturbations on the luminosity distance of distant galaxies , within the context of perturbed frw models , has been investigated in the past ( e.g.  @xcite ) , in an attempt to reconcile expression ( [ eq : dl ] ) with positive values for the deceleration parameter . that work has investigated the impact of peculiar motions on @xmath103 . here , we have followed a different approach . turning our attention to the deceleration parameter ,",
    "the aim was to examine whether peculiar motions can ` make ' the latter negative .",
    "our results show that this is theoretically possible .",
    "peculiar motions can locally mimic the kinematic effects of dark energy .",
    "observers moving relative to the smooth hubble flow can have local expansion rates appreciably different than that of the actual universe .",
    "this reflects the fact that the raychaudhuri equations in the two coordinate systems ( that of the cmb and that of a drifting observer ) are not the same .",
    "the difference is due to a 4-acceleration term , which vanishes in the cmb frame but takes nonzero values in any other relatively moving reference system . as a result ,",
    "accelerated expansion is possible even when the drift velocities are small and matter is simple pressure - free dust , namely within the limits of the linear ( almost - frw ) approximation .",
    "extrapolating our drift velocity relative to the cmb frame , we found that peculiarly moving observers can measure negative deceleration parameter on scales between ( roughly ) 50 and 1000  mpc , with @xmath40 varying in the range ( -0.4,0 ) .",
    "based on the surveys of  @xcite ,  @xcite and particularly those of  @xcite , the deceleration parameter was confined within ( -0.3,0 ) .",
    "these results are qualitatively in the right direction , though quantitatively stop short of fully reproducing the current supernovae data .",
    "in particular , the largest scale considered here is between a half and a third of the typical scale of the accelerated domain  @xcite . also , typically , the larger the scale the lower the required ( effective ) density parameter , putting the latter potentially at odds with the current observational constraints . on these grounds ,",
    "this work should be seen as a proof of principle , rather than a full fit to the current supernovae data . nonetheless , it is important to know that ( based on estimates inferred from peculiar - flow observations ) apparently accelerating expansion is possible in linearly perturbed frw models with conventional ( dust ) matter .",
    "given that peculiar velocities are a byproduct of structure formation , their role can be seen as a ` backreaction ' effect ( e.g.  see  @xcite and also  @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "these scenarios consider the overall impact of inhomogeneity and anisotropy , go beyond the linear regime and usually employ an averaging scheme  @xcite .",
    "averaging also raises issues related to the ` fitting problem ' and the choice of a ` background '  @xcite , the ` dressing ' of cosmological parameters  @xcite , the propagation of light  @xcite and the ` synchronisation of clocks '  @xcite .",
    "here , we have focused on peculiar motions without introducing any spatial averaging .",
    "we have also remained within the linear approximation .",
    "nevertheless , the effects are of the same nature . also , since we have looked at peculiar velocities that increase the volume expansion at the observer s location , our model shares close analogies with a local void .",
    "the possibility of apparent acceleration in the void scenario has been studied by many authors both qualitatively and quantitatively ( e.g.  see  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite for a representative though incomplete list ) . whereas the effects of large voids have been generally studied in the context of the lemaitre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) solution ,",
    "our analysis has been performed within a perturbed frw model .",
    "the analogies between the two approaches found here , also seem to support the claim by  @xcite : that ltb models fitting the supernovae data ( with appropriate initial conditions ) are equivalent to perturbed frw spacetimes along the observer s past light - cone .",
    "although single void models appear unrealistic , given the complexity of the observed structure , the simple analysis and the results presented here suggest that ( when more realistic averages are performed ) identifying the deceleration parameter measured in the frame of a drifting observer with that of the universe itself could be misleading .",

    "<S> recent surveys seem to support bulk peculiar velocities well in excess of those anticipated by the standard cosmological model . in view of these results , we consider here some of the theoretical implications of large - scale drift motions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that observers with small , but finite , peculiar velocities have generally different expansion rates than the smooth hubble flow . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it is possible for observers with larger than the average volume expansion at their location , to experience apparently accelerated expansion when the universe is actually decelerating . </S>",
    "<S> analogous results have been reported in studies of inhomogeneous ( nonlinear ) cosmologies and within the context of the lemaitre - tolman - bondi models . here , they are obtained within the linear regime of a perturbed , dust - dominated friedmann - robertson - walker cosmology . </S>"
