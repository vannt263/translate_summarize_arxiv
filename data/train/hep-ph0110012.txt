    "the experimental possibility of studying the phase transitions of qcd via ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions with the current effort at rhic and the forthcoming program at lhc motivates a theoretical effort to understand the dynamical aspects of phase transitions at high temperature .",
    "qcd is conjectured to feature two phase transitions , the confinement - deconfinement ( or hadronization ) and the chiral phase transitions .",
    "detailed lattice studies@xcite seem to predict that both transitions occur at about the same temperature @xmath14 .",
    "while lattice gauge theories furnish a non - perturbative tool to study the thermodynamic equilibrium aspects of the transition the _ dynamical _ aspects can not be accessed with this approach .    in a condensed matter experiment",
    "the temperature is typically a control parameter and it can be varied sufficiently slow so as to ensure that a phase transition occurs in local thermodynamic equilibrium . in an ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision",
    "the current theoretical understanding suggests that a thermalized quark - gluon plasma may be formed at a time scale of order @xmath15 with a temperature larger than the critical .",
    "this quark - gluon plasma then expands hydrodynamically and cools almost adiabatically , the temperature falling off as a power of time @xmath16 until the transition temperature is reached at a time scale @xmath17 depending on the initial temperature@xcite .",
    "whether the phase transition occurs in local thermodynamic equilibrium or not depends on the ratio of the cooling time scale @xmath18 to the relaxation or thermalization time scale of a fluctuation of a given wavelength @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath21 then the fluctuation relaxes in time scales much shorter than that of the temperature variation and reaches local thermodynamic equilibrium . if , on the other hand , @xmath22 the fluctuation does not have time to relax to local thermodynamic equilibrium and freezes out . for these fluctuations",
    "the phase transition occurs _ very fast _ and out of equilibrium .",
    "thus an important _ dynamical _ aspect is to understand the relaxation time scales for fluctuations .",
    "a large body of theoretical , experimental and numerical work in condensed matter physics reveal that while typically short wavelength ( @xmath23 ) fluctuations reach local thermal equilibrium , near a critical point long wavelength fluctuations relax very slowly , and undergo _ _ critical slowing down__@xcite . a phenomenological description of the dynamics near a phase transition typically hinges on the time - dependent landau - ginzburg equation which is generalized to include conservation laws@xcite . in the simplest case of a non - conserved order parameter , such as in a scalar field theory with discrete ( ising - like ) symmetry , the time dependent landau ginzburg equation is purely dissipative .",
    "while phenomenological , this approach has proved very succesful in a variety of experimental situations and is likely to provide a suitable description of the dynamics for macroscopic , coarse - grained systems such as binary mixtures , etc.@xcite . the phenomenological approach based on the time",
    "dependent landau - ginzburg equations which are first order in time derivatives seem to provide a suitable description of coarse - grained macroscopic dynamics in _ non - relativistic systems_. however it is clear that such approach is not justified in a relativistic quantum field theory , since the underlying equations of motion are second order and time reversal invariant .",
    "in particular in the case of purely dissipative time dependent landau ginsburg ( phenomenological ) description@xcite , frequency and momenta enter with different powers in the propagators , and at the mean field ( or tree ) level , this results in a dynamical scaling exponent @xmath24 .",
    "this situation must be contrasted to that of a relativistic quantum field theory where at tree level ( mean field ) frequencies and momenta enter with the same power in the propagator leading to a dynamical scaling exponent @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , critical slowing down is automatically built in the phenomenological description , even at _ tree level _ as a consequence of dissipative equations of motion@xcite .",
    "clearly this is not the case in a relativistic quantum field theory . for a detailed discussion of the differences of non - equilibrium dynamical aspects between the time dependent landau ginzburg approach and quantum field theory see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are important non - equilibrium consequences of slow dynamics near critical points .",
    "if the cooling time scale is much shorter than the relaxation time scale of long - wavelength fluctuations , these freeze out and undergo spinodal instabilities when the temperature falls below the critical@xcite during continuous ( no metastability ) phase transitions .",
    "these instabilities result in the formation of correlated domains that grow in time@xcite with a law that in general depends on the cooling rate@xcite .    in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions during the expansion of the quark gluon plasma the critical point for the chiral phase transition may be reached .",
    "if long wavelength fluctuations freeze out shortly before the transition , the ensuing instabilities may lead to distinct event by event observables@xcite in the pion distribution as well as in the photon spectrum at low energies@xcite .",
    "thus an important aspect of the chiral phase transition is to establish the relaxation time scales of long - wavelength fluctuations , and whether critical slowing down and freeze out of long - wavelength fluctuations can ensue .    in the strict chiral limit with massless up and down quarks",
    ", qcd has an @xmath26 symmetry which is spontaneously broken to @xmath27 at the chiral phase transition , the three pions being the goldstone bosons associated with the broken symmetry .",
    "it has been argued that the low energy theory that describes the chiral phase transition is in the same universality class as the heisenberg ferromagnet , i.e , the @xmath28 linear sigma model@xcite .",
    "this argument has been used@xcite to provide an assessment of the dynamical aspects of low energy qcd based on the phenomenological time - dependent landau ginzburg approach to dynamical critical phenomena in condensed matter@xcite . while the universality arguments are appealing , a more microscopic understanding of dynamical critical phenomena in _ quantum field theory _",
    "is needed and has begun to emerge only recently@xcite .",
    "in reference@xcite a wilsonian renormalization group extended to finite temperature was implemented in a scalar quartic field theory . in this approach",
    "only one loop diagrams enter in the computation of the beta functions , and the imaginary part of the self energy , which arises first at two loops order for @xmath29 is accounted for by an imaginary part in the effective quartic coupling@xcite . there",
    "it is found that the relaxation rate of zero momentum fluctuations @xmath30 reveals critical slowing down in the form @xmath31 .",
    "our study in this article is complementary to that program in that we focus on the dynamical aspects of long - wavelength quasiparticles with @xmath32 . as discussed in@xcite and in detail below this is closer to the _ classical _ regime .    * the goals : * in this article we study the _ dynamical _ aspects of quasiparticles near the critical point in a scalar quartic field theory by implementing a renormalization group program at high temperature . while the renormalization group has been generalized to finite temperature in various formulations@xcite , mainly to study critical phenomena associated with finite temperature phase transitions in field theory , only _",
    "static _ aspects were studied with these approaches .",
    "instead we focus on _ dynamical _ aspects , in particular the dispersion relations , and relaxation rates of long - wavelength excitations at and near the critical point . already at the technical level",
    "one can see the differences : to understand dynamical aspects , in particular relaxation , a consistent treatment of absorptive parts of self - energies is required .",
    "this aspect is notoriously difficult to implement in a wilsonian approach in euclidean field theory@xcite .",
    "reference@xcite proposes a method to circumvent this problem but a complete treatment that manifestly includes absorptive parts of self - energy contributions is still lacking in this approach .",
    "other approaches using the euclidean version of the renormalization group adapted to finite temperature field theory were restricted to static quantities@xcite and in fact , as it will be seen in detail below , miss important phenomena that will be at the heart of the results presented here .",

    "the perturbative expansion in four space - time dimensions is in terms of the dimensionless ratio @xmath36 with @xmath37 the typical momentum scale , which is strongly relevant in the infrared . as a result ,",
    "a perturbative approach to studying long - wavelength phenomena breaks down .",
    "this is manifest in the breakdown of the quasiparticle picture in naive perturbation theory ( see@xcite and below ) .    in @xmath38 space - time dimensions , the effective coupling in the high temperature ,",
    "long wavelength limit is @xmath39 .",
    "we implement an @xmath0 expansion around _ five _ space - time dimensions and a renormalization group resummation program at high temperature with @xmath40 near the critical point , with @xmath41 the typical frequency and momentum scales .",
    "we analyze the high temperature behavior of the relevant graphs and find that it is dominated for @xmath42 by the zero matsubara mode while the sum of the nonzero modes gives subdominant contributions .",
    "the effective renormalized coupling is driven to an infrared stable fixed point @xmath43 , which for small @xmath0 allows a consistent perturbative expansion near the fixed point .",
    "an important feature that emerges clearly in this approach , and that has been missed in most other treatments of renormalization group at finite temperature , is the _ anisotropic _ scaling between spatial and time directions , which is manifest in a non - trivial renormalization of the speed of light .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that in the euclidean formulation at finite temperature time is compatified to @xmath44 , thus space and time or momentum and frequency play different roles .",
    "this results in a novel _ dynamical _ critical exponent , @xmath11 which determines the anisotropic scaling .",
    "the renormalization group leads to scaling in the infrared region in terms of anomalous dimensions which can be computed systematically in the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "in particular , to lowest order in @xmath0 we find for a scalar theory with discrete symmetry @xmath45,which describes a new universality class for dynamical critical phenomena in quantum field theory .",
    "all dynamical aspects , such as the relaxation rates , and dispersion relations depend on this critical exponent , while the static aspects are completely described by the usual critical exponents .",
    "we provide a renormalization group analysis of the quasiparticle properties near the critical point , such as their dispersion relation and width , complemented with an explicit evaluation to lowest order in the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "the main results obtained in this article are the following : at @xmath46 we find that the dispersion relation and width of quasiparticles of momentum @xmath2 is @xmath3 and @xmath47 respectively with a vanishing group velocity of quasiparticles in the long wavelength limit highlighting the collective nature of the quasiparticle excitations .",

    "we find to lowest order in the epsilon expansion that the dynamical exponent @xmath52 .",
    "critical slowing down emerges near the critical point and in the @xmath0 expansion @xmath53 confirming the quasiparticle picture .",
    "we discuss some relevant cases of threshold singularities in which the usual ( breit - wigner ) parametrization of the quasiparticle propagator is not available since the real part of the inverse green s function vanishes at the quasiparticle frequency with an anomalous power law .    in section",
    "ii we introduce the model and discuss the breakdown of naive perturbation theory . in section iii",
    "we introduce the @xmath0 expansion and analyze the static case . in section",
    "iv the renormalization aspects and the anisotropic scaling is analyzed in detail .",

    "this section contains the bulk of our results which are summarized in section vi .",
    "our conclusions and a discussion of potential implications are presented in section vii .",
    "the high temperature behavior of the relevant diagrams is computed in the appendices .",
    "the low energy sector of qcd with two massless ( up and down ) quarks is conjectured to be in the same universality class as the @xmath28 heisenberg ferromagnet@xcite described by the @xmath28 linear sigma model . furthermore , since we are interested in describing the dynamical aspects associated with critical slowing down and freeze out of long - wavelength fluctuations just before the chiral phase transition , we focus on @xmath54 .    while our motivation for studying critical slowing down stems from the experimental program in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions , the questions are of a fundamental nature .    to understand the dynamical aspects near the critical point , we focus on the simpler case of a single scalar field theory , and we will recover the case of @xmath12 symmetry at the end of the discussion .",
    "we thus focus on the theory described by the lagrangian density @xmath55 where the subscripts in the mass and coupling refer to bare quantities .",
    "the case of @xmath56 components in the unbroken phase @xmath57 differs from the single scalar field by combinatoric factors that change the critical exponents quantitatively .",
    "these factors will be at the end of the calculation to obtain an estimate of the critical exponents for the @xmath12 theory in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we are interested in obtaining the relaxation properties of long wavelength excitations near the critical temperature , which in this scalar theory @xmath58 with @xmath59 being the renormalized mass and coupling .",
    "thus the regime of interest for this work is @xmath60 with @xmath61 being the momentum and frequency of the long wavelength excitation .",
    "as it will become clear below it is convenient to work in the matsubara representation of finite temperature field theory , which is more amenable to the implementation of the ( euclidean ) renormalization group",
    ".    in the matsubara formulation euclidean time @xmath62 is compactified in the interval @xmath63 whereas space is infinite , bosonic fields are periodic in euclidean time and can be expanded as@xcite @xmath64 thus we see that while the spatial momentum is a continuum variable , the matsubara frequencies are discrete as a consequence of the compactification of euclidean time .",
    "this feature of euclidean field theory at finite temperature will be seen to lead to _ anisotropic _ rescaling between space and time and therefore , as it will be clear below , new _",
    "dynamical _ critical exponents . anticipating anisotropic rescaling , we then introduce the bare speed of propagation @xmath65 of excitations in the medium by writing the euclidean lagrangian in the form @xmath66 where we have introduced the effective renormalized _ temperature dependent _ mass @xmath67 and the counterterms , in particular the mass counterterm @xmath68 is adjusted order by order in perturbation theory so that the inverse two point function obeys @xmath69 the critical point is defined with ( the inverse susceptibility ) @xmath70 .",
    "we will begin our study by focusing our attention on the critical theory for which @xmath71 .",

    "the infrared behavior for @xmath92 is obtained by considering only the zero internal matsubara frequency in the loop .",
    "this integral has only one scale and since @xmath35 is dimensionless in three spatial dimensions the one - loop contribution must be proportional to @xmath91 .",
    "a similar argument shows that for a diagram with m internal loops , and transferred momentum scale @xmath37 there will be a power @xmath93 from the matsubara sums , the infrared behavior is obtained by the contribution with _ all _ the internal matsubara frequencies equal to zero , which by dimensional power counting must be of the form @xmath94 . therefore a diagram with m - internal loops will contribute to the scattering amplitude with @xmath95 . in taking only the zero internal matsubara frequency",
    "we are assuming that the internal loop momenta are cutoff at a scale @xmath96 .",
    "thus , at the critical point the most important infrared behavior is that of the _ dimensionally reduced _ three dimensional theory@xcite .",
    "the reason for this dimensional reduction is clear : at finite temperature @xmath33 the euclidean time is compactified to a cylinder of radius @xmath97 for transferred momenta @xmath37 the spatial resolution is on distances @xmath98 .",
    "therefore for @xmath99 thus the compactification radius is effectively zero insofar as the long distance ( infrared ) physics is concerned .",
    "we will study below the contribution from the non - zero matsubara frequencies .",
    "ii ) for a transferred momentum scale @xmath37 perturbation theory breaks down for @xmath100 since the contribution from higher orders is of the form @xmath95 .",
    "this suggests that a resummation scheme is needed to study the infrared limit .",
    "this situation is similar to that in critical phenomena where infrared divergences must be summed and the renormalization group provides a consistent and systematic resummation procedure . we can obtain a hint of how to implement the renormalization group in finite temperature field theory in the limit when @xmath33 is much larger than any other scale ( masses , momenta and frequency ) by realizing that , from the argument presented above , the perturbative expansion is actually in terms of the dimensionless coupling @xmath101 .",

    "the leading order in the large @xmath56 limit for the scattering amplitude is obtained by summing the geometric series of one - loop bubbles in the s - channel ( only this channel out of the three contribute to leading order in the large n limit ) , each one proportional to @xmath56 which is the number of fields in the loop . as a result",
    "one finds that the effective scattering amplitude at a momentum transfer @xmath37 is given by@xcite @xmath110 thus , introducing the dimensionless effective coupling @xmath111 one finds that @xmath112 i.e , the effective coupling constant goes to the three dimensional fixed point@xcite .",

    "this expression clearly reveals the effective coupling @xmath127 which becomes very large in the limit @xmath128 .",
    "clearly we need to implement a resummation scheme that will effectively replace the bare dimensionless coupling constant by the effective coupling that goes to a fixed point in the long - wavelength limit , and also ensure that at this fixed point the effective coupling is _ small _ so that perturbation theory near this fixed point is reliable .",
