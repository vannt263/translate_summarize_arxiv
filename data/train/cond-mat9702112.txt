    "together with their large superconducting critical temperatures , the cuprates display several anomalous normal state properties which can not be described in terms of the standard fermi liquid ( fl ) theory .",
    "one possible explanation for these anomalous properties of the normal phase is that the low dimensionality of such highly anisotropic systems and their correlated nature are at the origin of a breakdown of the fl .",
    "fl theory indeed breaks down in a variety of physical situations as , for instance , in quasi - one dimensional conductors .",
    "the one - dimensional metallic phase is described by the so - called luttinger liquid theory with no quasi - particle weight at the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "the assessed breakdown of fl theory in @xmath1 suggested the very intriguing theoretical question of a non - fermi liquid metallic behavior in two - dimensional electron systems as an extension of the one - dimensional case @xcite .",
    "however , it was recently found @xcite that , for non - singular interactions ( involving small momentum transfer ) luttinger behaviour is strictly confined to one - dimensional metals . only sufficiently singular ( stronger than the purely coulombic interaction ) long - range forces give non - fl at low energy above one dimension @xcite .",
    "the anomalous properties would then arise as a consequence of singular scattering processes at low energy",
    ".    singular scattering can be due to gauge field fluctuations @xcite , which arise by implementing the resonating - valence - bond idea in the t - j model .",
    "an alternative point of view is related to the existence of a quantum critical point ( qcp ) , where critical fluctuations can mediate singular interactions between the quasiparticles , providing at the same time a strong pairing mechanism .",
    "the proximity to the critical point at zero temperature is naturally characterized by the absence of any energy scale besides the temperature itself .",
    "this would agree with what can be inferred from the many anomalous features of the normal state at optimal doping .",
    "various proposals have been put forward on the possible nature of the qcp , ranging from a magnetic mechanism @xcite to charge - transfer @xcite or to incommensurate charge - density - wave ( icdw ) @xcite .    in the antiferromagnetic ( af )",
    "qcp proposal a difficulty arises .",
    "specifically , the most evident features of non - fl behavior in the normal phase and the largest superconducting critical temperature occur at optimal doping which would be in the quantum disordered region far away from the position of the af transition .",
    "to explain this behavior a mechanism ( substantial vertex corrections ) has to be advocated @xcite to suppress the effect of critical fluctuations , which would otherwise be the strongest at low doping just above the af transition . besides the fact that in the disordered regime the depression of the effective interaction due to vertex correction is not established , it would be hard to understand why at optimal doping the best non - fl behavior always occurs for all the classes of materials .",
    "indeed within this scenario optimal doping is a quite generic point of the quantum disordered region with a finite energy scale .",
    "the peculiarities of optimal doping make this point a natural candidate where to place a qcp relevant for the superconducting and the non - fl properties of the cuprates .",
    "as far as the nature of this critical point is concerned , it seems quite likely that charge degrees of freedom should play the major role , since the disordered region of this qcp coincides with the highly metallic overdoped regime . in this context , besides the appealing but rather exotic proposal of a simmetry breaking related to persistent charge - transfer currents @xcite , we believe that an icdw - qcp has strong support from both the theoretical and the experimental point of view . the existence of an icdw - qcp is not alternative to the existence of an af - qcp and the two qcp s control the behavior of the system at different doping .",
    "the icdw - qcp sets up the maximum superconducting critical temperature and can constitute the substrate to substain af fluctuations far away from the af ordered phase , by allowing for hole - rich and hole - poor `` stripes '' .",
    "after phase separation ( ps ) was shown to be present in the phase diagram of the t - j model @xcite , we pointed out that ps commonly occurs in models with short range interactions@xcite-@xcite , provided a strong local @xmath2-@xmath2 repulsion inhibits the stabilizing role of the kinetic energy .",
    "we therefore stressed that ps and superconductivity are related phenomena irrespective of the nature of the short - range interaction ( magnetic , excitonic , phononic , ... ) @xcite .",
    "emery and kivelson @xcite suggested that , although long - range coulomb ( lrc ) forces spoil ps as a static thermodynamic phenomenon , the frustrated tendency towards ps may still be important and give rise to large - amplitude charge collective density fluctuations . approaching the problem within a coarse - grained model",
    ", they suggested that these fluctuations may be responsible for the anomalous behaviour of the normal phase .",
    "a static pseudospin formulation @xcite of these ideas showed the formation of a phase with hole - rich and hole - poor stripes .",
    "this latter result is on the same line of the finding of refs .",
    "@xcite , where an icdw phase was shown to arise in models where ps is spoiled by lrc forces .",
    "our finding is then that in all these models there exists a qcp associated to the formation of icdw . near this qcp",
    "the dynamic effective interaction between quasiparticles has a singular behavior @xcite , strongly affecting the single - particle properties and the transport scattering time . in the cooper channel",
    "the same singular scattering provides a strong pairing mechanism with an anisotropic order parameter of @xmath0-wave symmetry @xcite .",
    "several experimental findings provide support for the existence of a qcp at ( or near ) optimal doping .",
    "this is found in recent transport experiments @xcite in @xmath3 ( lsco ) , with high magnetic fields , which allow to access the normal phase hidden by superconductivity , and assess the presence of a metal - insulator transition ending at optimal doping at @xmath4 .",
    "indications in the same sense are provided by neutron scattering @xcite revealing a huge increase of a magnetic dynamical correlation length in nearly optimally doped lsco .",
    "qualitative changes of behavior at optimal doping are also detected by optical spectroscopy @xcite , nmr @xcite , susceptibility @xcite , neutron scattering @xcite , photoemission @xcite , specific heat @xcite , thermoelectric power @xcite , hall coefficient @xcite , resistivity @xcite .",
    "it is also suggestive that several quantities ( resistivity , hall number , uniform susceptibility ) display a scaling behavior with a typical energy scale , which vanishes at optimal doping @xcite .",
    "many indications exist that the above qcp involves charge ordering . in ref .",
    "the metal - insulator transition at t=0 occurs with a high value of @xmath5 ( clean limit ) suggesting that some charge ordering underlies the insulating behavior of the underdoped lsco samples .",
    "a direct observation of charge - driven ordering was possible by neutron scattering @xcite , in @xmath6 where the related bragg peaks were detected .",
    "for this specific compound the low temperature tetragonal lattice structure pins the cdw and gives static order and semiconducting behavior ( see also the case of @xmath7 ) . increasing the sr content at fixed nd concentration ,",
    "the pinning effect is reduced leading to metallic and superconducting behavior . in this latter case ,",
    "the existence of dynamical icdw fluctuations is suggested by the presence of dynamical incommensurate spin scattering , although the charge peaks are too weak to be observed . in this",
    "regard , also the @xmath3 is expected to display dynamical charge fluctuations with doping - dependent spatial modulation as indeed observed in the magnetic scattering @xcite .",
    "icdw have been proposed from extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) experiments both in optimally doped lsco @xcite and @xmath8 ( bi-2212 ) @xcite .",
    "superstructures have also been detected in bi-2212 from x - ray diffraction @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we will consider the singular interactions arising in the proximity of charge instabilities .",
    "in particular we will consider an icdw instability , which is present in strongly correlated models due to the interplay between ps and lrc forces .",
    "this instability is found @xcite in specific models at t=0 starting from a uniform fl phase describing the low - temperature overdoped phase of the superconducting cuprates . once the icdw instability will be shown to occur ,",
    "the challenging task remains of providing a complete description of the systems at finite temperature and in the underdoped phase , where superconductivity , ( dynamical ) icdw order and magnetism interplay .",
    "while a full theoretical understanding of this latter phase is still missing , in section iii we will provide a general scenario for the t vs. doping @xmath9 phase diagram of the cuprates based both on theoretical results and on experimental evidences .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section iv .",
    "the evaluation of the density - density correlation function @xmath10 provides information on the ( charge ) stability . in particular",
    "a divergence in the static correlation function @xmath11 signals the occurrence of ps ( at @xmath12 ) or of cdw instabilities ( at finite @xmath13 s ) .",
    "a complete investigation of the static and dynamical properties of the infinite - u hubbard - holstein model together with the analysis of its stability was carried out in a previous work @xcite .",
    "here we just mention that , within a large - n slave - boson formalism , this model displays a phonon - driven charge instability even for rather small values of the electron - phonon coupling @xmath14 @xcite . in the absence of lrc forces",
    "the ps instability occurs before any other finite @xmath13 instability .",
    "the introduction of lrc forces eliminates the @xmath15 divergence in the static correlation function always giving rise to icdw .",
    "the finite critical @xmath16 , in this case , is not related to any pseudonesting of the fermi surface .",
    "@xmath16 is determined by the momentum dependence of the ( divergent ) static correlation function with only short - range forces and by the strength @xmath17 , which parametrize the lrc forces according to @xmath18 the momenta are in units of the inverse planar lattice spacing @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the interplane distance and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the corresponding dielectric constants .    a divergent scattering amplitude between quasiparticles @xmath23 will follow from a divergent correlation function @xmath24 .",
    "indeed the interaction between the quasiparticles is mediated by the exchange of bosonic degrees of freedom , e.g. phonons and slave - boson fields accounting for the strong local repulsion u. these bosonic excitations have a singular propagator , which enters in the expressions of both @xmath25 and @xmath24 establishing a clear connection between the charge instability and the singular quasiparticle scattering .    near the ps instability ( @xmath26 ) ,",
    "the anomalous behavior of @xmath25 is identified to be of the form @xcite",
    "@xmath27 @xmath28 describes the ( almost momentum - independent , i.e. local ) residual repulsion mediated by the slave bosons : within the large - n slave - boson formalism , the infinite u repulsion between the bare fermions , is reduced to a rather weak residual repulsion between the fermi - liquid quasiparticles .",
    "@xmath29 is a damping coefficient .",
    "the mass term @xmath30 vanishes linearly when , for a given @xmath14 , the instability takes place at the critical doping @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 can be interpreted as the inverse correlation length for the density fluctuations , @xmath33 .",
    "it is worth noticing that the singular part of the effective interaction in eq .",
    "( [ fitgamsr ] ) has the same functional form as the scattering amplitude mediated by gauge fields @xcite , although its physical origine is obviously different .",
    "the singular behavior of @xmath34 at the ps instability is by no means surprising within a fl framework .",
    "indeed , the fl expression for the compressibility is @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the standard dynamic ( @xmath37 ) limit of the scattering amplitude @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the quasiparticle density of states at the fermi level .",
    "this indicates that a divergent @xmath40 , when the quasiparticle mass remains finite ( @xmath41 ) , only happens when @xmath42 ( pomeranchuk criterion ) . at the same time @xmath43 .",
    "we point out here that the above arguments keep their validity irrespective of the mechanism leading to ps .",
    "however ps is related to a first order transition and the need of a maxwell construction introduces in the phase diagram a cohexistence region embedding the spinodal instability line . except for the end critical point , the compelled distance of the stable region from the instability line may render the above mechanism for obtaining singular scattering non - generic .",
    "we now proceed to the more likely situation which originates from the presence of lrc forces . in this case",
    "the singular part of @xmath25 can be written as @xmath44 where the sum is over the four equivalent vectors of the cdw instability @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "this expression is used to reproduce the behavior @xmath47 for @xmath48 while mantaining the lattice periodicity .    also in this case a linear behavior of the mass term @xmath30 was found . for reasonable parameters ( e.g. , for lsco systems we considered a first and next nearest neighbor hopping @xmath49 ev and @xmath50 respectively , @xmath51 ev",

    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the scattering is quite strong , although non - singular , in all directions for @xmath59 .",
    "the ( almost ) isotropic contribution to the static scattering amplitude is much less fragile under doping variations , than the singular term itself .",
    "the imaginary term in the denominators in the r.h.s . of eqs.([fitgamsr ] ) and ( [ fitgamlr ] ) reproduces on a wide range of transferred momenta @xmath13 the behaviour of the imaginary part of the mean field fermionic polarization bubble @xmath60 \\propto \\omega /q$ ] at small @xmath61",
    ". this indicates , that , despite the complicated formal structure of the scattering amplitude within the slave - boson formalism , near the instability a simple rpa - like structure results in the final expression .",
    "this supports the idea that the forms ( [ fitgamsr ] ) and ( [ fitgamlr ] ) are generic of ps or icdw and not related to the specific mechanism , which gives rise to the tendency towards phase separation .",
    "in the previous section an icdw instability was shown to occur at t=0 by decreasing doping from an overdoped strongly correlated fl system . according to the scenario outlined in section i",
    ", this icdw - qcp is the crucial ingredient characterizing the physics of the cuprates all over their metallic ( under- , optimally , and over - doped ) regime . as seen in sec .",
    "ii , the icdw - qcp is characterized by singular interactions , which in the rpa - like treatment of the model assumed the form of eq.([fitgamlr ] ) .",
    "this functional dependence is not strictly related to the specific origine of the qcp , as also witnessed by its similarity to the interactions proposed for systems near the af - qcp @xcite , where the instability also occurs for a finite value of @xmath62 .",
    "however eq.([fitgamlr ] ) could depend from our approximate ( nearly - mean - field ) treatment .",
    "nevertheless the singular nature of interactions mediated by critical fluctuations is a sound consequence . for the sake of definiteness and simplicity",

    "as far as @xmath82 is concerned , this temperature marks the onset of the icdw precursors and is characterized by a loss of spectral weight at low energies giving rise to a uniform decrease of the density of states near the fermi energy .",

    "[ fig5 ]    of course the above bcs treatment only deals with the amplitude of the gap and says nothing on the way a true superconducting phase coherence is established below a critical temperature @xmath127 . for this",
    "we have to invoke phase fluctuations as in the usual ( large ) negative - u hubbard model . here",
    "the strongly peaked @xmath13-dependence of the pairing potential , which only couples few points on the fermi surface , and precursors of ( 1d ) stripe formation are expected to give rise to strong phase fluctuations .",
    "it is also important to emphasize that the occurrence of local pairing prevents the actual establishing of the icdw long - range order @xcite , so that @xmath84 looses its meaning of a true transition line , merely indicating the area where pairing and strong local - dynamical icdw order selfconsistently interplay .    as far as magnetic properties are concerned",
    ", we notice that the presence of fluctuating hole - poor and hole - rich stripes favors the presence of ( locally commensurate ) antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the hole - poor regions .",
    "this generically explains why , despite the rapid spoiling of the long - range af by doping , magnetic features survive up to much larger ( optimal ) doping .",
    "irrespective of the dominant mechanism leading to icdw formation , magnetism also contributes to further expelling charge from the hole - poor stripes easily leading to non - linear phenomena and higher harmonics generation .",
    "the presence of locally commensurate af order embedded in incommensurate stripes would also reconcile nmr and neutron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "the scenario presented in this work was based on the existence of icdw instabilities in strongly correlated systems and on generic properties of qcp s in quasi - twodimensional systems .",
    "these properties were exploited to establish some consequences of the icdw - qcp scenario , like , e.g. , the marked non - fl character of the optimally doped quantum disordered region , the @xmath0-wave symmetry of the superconducting order and the peculiar doping dependence of the superconducting critical temperature in the over- and optimally doped regions . in these homogeneous regions",
    "rather simple theoretical approaches put our conclusions on a rather firm ground . on the other hand ,",
    "the theoretical treatment of the underdoped phase is made difficult by the interplay of three different local fields associated to the tendency towards three ordered phases ( magnetic , charge - ordered and superconducting ) .",
    "this renders our scenario less established thus calling for further confirmations .",
    "it is however remarkable that the temperature dependence of the pairing potential implied by the icdw scenario accounts well for the peculiar ( so far unexplained ) temperature behavior of the local gap and for the non - trivial relation between @xmath120 and @xmath128 .      for a review on @xmath129 and quasi-@xmath129 electronic systems ,",
