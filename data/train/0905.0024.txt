    "spectrum sensing plays an important role in cognitive radio ( cr ) systems , and cyclostationary feature detection is one of the main technologies for spectrum sensing in low snr cases [ 1 - 2 ] .",
    "the idea of cyclic detection is that one cr node samples the rf signals , transform the time domain signals into cyclic frequency domain , then decide primary user s occupancy of a target band regarding whether the cyclic spectrum on a significant cyclic frequency is above a certain threshold [ 2 ] .",
    "+ although the simulation results of cyclostationary feature detection has been studied [ 3 - 5 ] , less attention has been paid to analyze the noise distribution on cyclic frequency domain . consequently , theoretical function between detection threshold @xmath1 and miss detection probability @xmath0 is not available , which makes it difficult for practical system design . for comparison , the theoretical function between detection threshold @xmath1 and miss detection probability @xmath0 of energy detection is available by using central and non - central chi - square distribution to model the distribution of the observation variable affected by time domain gaussian noise [ 6 ] , which makes energy detection to be a practical method for spectrum sensing .",
    "however , its performance in low snr cases is much poorer than cyclostationary feature detection [ 7 ] . in this paper ,",
    "noise distribution on cyclic frequency domain has been analyzed and generalized extreme value distribution is found to be a precise match of the observation variable affected by time domain gaussian noise . a fast cyclic frequency domain feature detection algorithm [ 7 ] has been introduced to evaluate the coincidence between theoretical roc curve and the simulated roc curve , which proves the reliability of theoretical distribution model and feasibility of practical system design .",
    "+ the rest part of the paper is organized as follows : section ii describes the system model of cyclostationary feature detection .",
    "noise distribution on cyclic frequency domain is analyzed in section iii .",
    "a fast cyclic frequency domain feature detection algorithm has been introduced in section iv .",
    "simulation results are given in section v. finally , conclusions are drawn in section vi .",
    "the spectrum sensing problem can be modeled as hypothesis testing . it is equivalent to distinguishing between the following two hypotheses : @xmath2 @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the received signal , the primary user s transmit signal and the gaussian noise , respectively . @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent the hypothesis that the primary user is active or inactive . due to the existence of noise , a certain threshold @xmath1 should be set to decide whether a primary user is active or not .",
    "probability of detection ( @xmath8 ) and false alarm ( @xmath0 ) are defined to evaluate the detection performance : @xmath9 the goal of detection is to maximize @xmath8 while maintain a given @xmath0 .",
    "+ when feature detection is applied , the detection model ( 1 ) changes into : @xmath10 @xmath11 is the spectrum correlation density ( scd ) of the received signal @xmath3 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the scd of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively [ 8 ] .    theoretically , gaussian noise @xmath5 is not a cyclostationary statistic process , then @xmath14 when @xmath15 [ 8 ] . as for cyclostationary signal @xmath4",
    ", there is a significant frequency set \\{@xmath16 } , on which @xmath17 . due to the ideal non - cyclostationary characteristic of gaussian noise ,",
    "any pre - set threshold @xmath1 on a significant frequency will lead to @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "in practice , scd is calculated for limited length signals , therefore , @xmath20 when @xmath15 [ 9 ] . as shown in fig.1 ,",
    "the background noise is obvious on @xmath21 square when calculating scd of a noise interfered am modulated signal .        in order to analyze the background noise distribution , a limited - length gaussian noise sequence @xmath22",
    "is considered : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the length of the analysis window , @xmath25 is the index of analysis window .",
    "noise data in each analysis window are transformed into cyclic frequency domain , and then mapped from @xmath21 square to @xmath26 axis through the following expression : @xmath27 for each cycle frequency @xmath16 , the cyclic spectrum value is aligned to a set \\{@xmath28 } , @xmath29 . according to the extreme definition of @xmath30 in ( 5 ) , generalized extreme value ( gev ) distribution is adopted to model the cyclic frequency domain noise [ 10 ] . the density function is : + when @xmath31 @xmath32 when @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the shape parameter , @xmath36 is the position parameter , @xmath37 is the scale parameter . and",
    "the parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath38 can be estimated by maximum likelihood estimation based on the noise sequence \\{@xmath39}. for most cases , @xmath40 , then the likelihood function is defined as follows : @xmath41 let @xmath42,@xmath43 then : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the estimated value of @xmath36 and @xmath38 . by solving ( 9 ) , @xmath45 and @xmath46",
