    "let @xmath3 be a closed , smooth manifold and let @xmath4 be an elliptic pseudo - differential operator acting between sobolev spaces of sections of two vector bundles over @xmath3 .",
    "the ellipticity of @xmath4 ensures that @xmath4 has finite dimensional kernel and cokernel .",
    "the difference @xmath5 is called the _ fredholm index _ of @xmath4 and turns out to depend only on the @xmath2-theory class @xmath6\\in k^0(t^ * v)$ ] of the principal symbol of @xmath4 ( we always use @xmath2-theory with compact supports ) . since every element in @xmath7 can be represented by the principal symbol of an elliptic pseudo - differential operator , one obtains in this way a group morphism @xmath8 called the _ analytical index _ , first introduced by m. atiyah and i. singer @xcite .    at first sight , the map @xmath9 seems to depend essentially on the analysis of elliptic equations , but the main result in @xcite is that the index map can be also defined in a purely topological terms in terms of embedding of @xmath3 in euclidean spaces .",
    "this definition in terms on embeddings leads to the so called _ topological index _ of atiyah and singer and the main result of @xcite is that the topological index map @xmath10 and the fredholm index map @xmath9 coincide .",
    "see @xcite for review of these results , including an extension to non - compact manifolds .",
    "the equality of the topological and fredholm indices then allowed m. atiyah and i. singer to obtain a formula for the index of an elliptic operator @xmath4 in terms of the chern classes of @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "their formula , the celebrated atiyah - singer index formula , involves , in addition to the chern character of the principal symbol of @xmath4 , also a universal characteristic class associated with the manifold , the so called todd class of the given manifold .",
    "it is a natural and important question then to search for extensions of the atiyah  singer results .",
    "it is not the place here to mention all existing generalizations of the atiyah - singer index theory , but let us mention here the fundamental work on connes on foliations @xcite as well as @xcite .",
    "the index theorem for families and bismut s superconnection formalism play an important role in the study of the so called `` anomalies '' in physics @xcite .",
    "a different but related direction is to extend this theory to singular spaces @xcite .",
    "an important step in the index problem on singular manifolds was made by melrose @xcite and schulze @xcite who have introduced the `` right class of pseudodifferential operators '' for index theory on singular spaces .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "generalizations of this theory to singular spaces may turn out to be useful in the development of efficient numerical methods @xcite .    in this paper , we shall focus on the case of a pseudomanifold @xmath11 with isolated conical singularities . in earlier work @xcite , the first two authors defined a @xmath12-algebra @xmath13 that is dual to the algebra of continuous functions on @xmath11 from the point of view of @xmath2-theory ( _ i.e. _  @xmath13 is a `` @xmath2-dual of @xmath11 '' in the sense of @xcite ) , which implies that there exists a natural isomorphism @xmath14 between the @xmath2-homology of @xmath11 and the @xmath2-theory of @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath12-algebra @xmath13 is the @xmath12-algebra of a groupoid denoted @xmath15 .",
    "one of the main results in @xcite , see also @xcite for similar results using different methods , is that the inverse of the map @xmath16 of equation can be realized , as in the smooth case , by a map that assigns to each element in @xmath17 an elliptic operator .",
    "thus elements of @xmath17 can be viewed as the symbols of some natural elliptic pseudodifferential operators realizing the @xmath2-homology of @xmath11 .",
    "of course , in the singular setting , one has to explain what is meant by `` elliptic operator '' and by `` symbol '' on @xmath11 .",
    "an example of a convenient choice of elliptic operator in our situation is an elliptic pseudodifferential operator in the @xmath18-calculus @xcite or melrose s @xmath19-calculus . as for the symbols , the notion is more or less the same as in the smooth case . on a manifold @xmath3",
    ", a symbol is a function on @xmath20 . for us",
    ", it will be convenient to view a symbol as a pointwise multiplication operator on @xmath21 .",
    "a fourier transform will allow us then to see a symbol as a family of convolution operators on @xmath22 .",
    "thus symbols on @xmath3 appear to be pseudo - differential operators on the _ groupoid _ @xmath23 .",
    "this picture generalizes then right away to our singular setting .",
    "in particular , it leads to a good notion of symbol for conical pseudomanifolds and enables us to interpret [ symbolmap ] as the principal symbol map .    in order to better explain our results , we need to introduce some notation .",
    "if @xmath24 is an amenable groupoid , we let @xmath25 denote @xmath26 .",
    "the analytical index is then defined exactly as in the regular case by @xmath27 &      \\mapsto & { \\mathop{\\mathrm{ind}}\\nolimits}(\\sigma^{-1}_x(a ) ) , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the usual fredholm index on compact spaces .",
    "moreover one can generalise the _ tangent groupoid _ of a. connes to our situation and get a nice description of the analytical index .    following the spirit of @xcite ,",
    "we define in this article a topological index @xmath29 that generalizes the classical one and which satisfies the equality : @xmath30 in fact , we shall see that all ingredients of the classical topological index have a natural generalisation to the singular setting .    @xmath31",
    "firstly the embedding of a smooth manifold into @xmath32 gives rise to a normal bundle @xmath33 and a thom isomorphism @xmath34 .",
    "in the singular setting we embed @xmath11 into @xmath35 , viewed as the cone over @xmath36 .",
    "this gives rise to a _",
    "conical vector bundle _ which is a conical pseudomanifold called the _ normal space _ and we get an isomorphism : @xmath37 .",
    "this map restrict to the usual thom isomorphism on the regular part and is called again the _ thom isomorphism_.",
    "@xmath31 secondly , in the smooth case , the normal bundle @xmath33 identifies with an open subset of @xmath32 , and thus provides an excision map @xmath38 .",
    "the same is true in the singular setting : @xmath39 appears to be an open subgroupoid of @xmath40 so we have an excision map @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath31 finally , using the bott periodicity @xmath42 and a natural @xmath43-equivalence between @xmath40 with @xmath44 we obtain an isomorphism @xmath45 .",
    "as for the usual definition of the topological index , this allows us to define our generalisation of the topological @xmath46 for conical manifolds .",
    "this construction of the topological index is inspired from the techniques of _ deformation groupoids _ introduced by m. hilsum and g. skandalis in @xcite . moreover",
    ", the demonstration of the equality between @xmath47 and @xmath46 will be the same in the smooth and in the singular setting with the help of deformation groupoids .",
    "we claim that our index maps are straight generalisations of the classical ones .",
    "to make this claim more concrete , consider a closed smooth manifold @xmath3 and choose a point @xmath48 .",
    "take a neighborhood of @xmath19 diffeomorphic to the unit ball in @xmath49 and consider it as the cone over @xmath50 .",
    "this provides @xmath3 with the structure of a conical manifold .",
    "then the index maps @xmath51 and @xmath52 both correspond to the canonical map @xmath53 through the poincar duality @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "in other words both notions of indices coincide trough the @xmath43-equivalence @xmath56 .",
    "we will investigate the case of general stratifications and the proof of an index formula in forthcoming papers .",

    "considering the closed saturated subspace @xmath734 of the space of units @xmath707 of @xmath735 , we get a restriction homomorphism : @xmath736 where @xmath737 denotes the space of suspended pseudodifferential operators of r. melrose @xcite .",
    "a noncommutative symbol @xmath738 is _ fully elliptic _ if there exists @xmath739 such that @xmath740 and @xmath741 are equal to @xmath155 modulo @xmath742 .",
    "fully elliptic symbols @xmath743 give canonically @xmath2-classes of the tangent space @xmath297 : @xmath744 = [ { \\mathcal{e}},\\mathbf{a}]\\in kk({\\mathbb c},c^*(t^ { \\mathsf{s}}x))=k^0(t^ { \\mathsf{s}}x)\\ ] ] where @xmath745 , @xmath18 any inverse of @xmath746 modulo @xmath747 and @xmath748 .              allowing vectors bundles @xmath117 over @xmath707 and defining the algebra of @xmath18-operators @xmath754 and the algebra of noncommutative symbols @xmath755 accordingly , we get a full description of @xmath756 in terms of @xmath18-operators and of @xmath757 in terms of noncommutative symbols .",
    "this is also proved in @xcite .",
    "thus , for any @xmath758 , we have : @xmath759 where @xmath760 is any @xmath18-operator such that @xmath761=x$ ] .",
    "the reader should not be surprised by our definition of ( noncommutative ) symbols : if @xmath3 is smooth manifold , the algebra of ordinary symbols is isomorphic to the algebra of pseudodifferential operators , for a suitable choice of regularizing operators imposed by the use of the fourier transform , on the _ groupoid _ @xmath23 .",
    "the symbol map @xmath762 constructed in @xcite makes sense on differential @xmath18-operators .",
    "it turns out that natural geometric operators on @xmath11 , when provided with a conical metric , can be written as @xmath18-differential operators with singular coefficients at @xmath730 , or , in the terminology of @xcite , fuchs type operators .",
    "we explain in this paragraph how to relate the analysis of these operators ( @xcite ) to our @xmath2-theoritic constructions , for the case of a dirac operator on @xmath11 even dimensional with one conical point @xmath71 .",
    "let @xmath187 be a riemmannian metric on @xmath708 which is conical on @xmath7630,1[\\times l$ ] , that is : @xmath764 . we assume to simplify the computations that the riemannian metric @xmath765 on @xmath57 is independant of @xmath766 when @xmath767 .",
    "we denote by @xmath768 the corresponding volume form .        in the case of a spin structure , using the canonical metric structure and clifford connection @xmath772 of the spinor bundle , and using on @xmath170 a metric structure of product type on @xmath773 and a compatible connection @xmath774 , we get on @xmath521 a metric structure , such that @xmath775 and @xmath776 for unitary tangent vectors @xmath777 , and a clifford connection @xmath778 such that the corresponding dirac operator @xmath779 is symmetric , when considered as an unbounded operator on @xmath780 with domain the space @xmath781 of compactly supported sections . recall that @xmath779 is defined locally by the formula : @xmath782 where @xmath783 is a local basis of @xmath784 .",
    "if @xmath708 has no spin structure , then the isomorphism @xmath770 remains true locally .",
    "thus , one can still construct locally on @xmath521 metrics and connections with the previous properties and then patch them with a partition of unity @xmath785 on @xmath11 ( that is @xmath786 is a finite open covering of @xmath708 by open charts , @xmath787 and @xmath788 ) .",
    "the resulting dirac operator is again symmetric , and all subsequent computations are exactly the same with or without spin structure .",
    "although the hilbert space @xmath780 , whose scalar product is given by @xmath789 is the most natural hilbert space with respect to the given geometric data , computations are easier with @xmath790 which is defined as , if @xmath791 denotes the obvious retraction map and @xmath792 , the completion of @xmath793 for the scalar product : @xmath794 one can choose an isometry @xmath795 such that @xmath796 is equal to identity on the complement of some open neighborhood of @xmath797 and given on @xmath307 by @xmath798 where @xmath799 is the parallel transport associated with the connection and the canonical identification @xmath8000,1[,c^\\infty(\\widetilde{{\\mathcal{e}}}))$ ] have been used .",
    "then , a straight computation shows that ( @xcite ) the following holds for sections @xmath71 supported on @xmath307 : @xmath801 where @xmath802 is a local orthonormal basis in @xmath803 and @xmath804 is the differential operator on @xmath57 , acting on the sections of @xmath805 , given by @xmath806 , where @xmath807 and @xmath808 is the connection on @xmath805 induced by @xmath778 .",
    "moreover we have @xmath809 , and the operator @xmath810 is given by the matrix , in the decomposition @xmath811 , @xmath812 where @xmath813 is again a symmetric dirac operator on the clifford module @xmath814 over @xmath57 .",
    "it is of course equivalent to study @xmath779 on @xmath815 or @xmath816 on @xmath790 .",
    "if we used @xmath817 instead of @xmath818 in ( [ eq : b - hilbert ] ) , which leads to the hilbert space used in @xcite to study fuchs type operators , @xmath819 would appear without the extra terms @xmath820 in ( [ eq : fuchs ] ) .",
    "the deformation process of @xcite used to associate noncommutative symbols to @xmath18-pseudodifferential operators , can be applied to @xmath512 and gives a family @xmath821 where @xmath822 and @xmath823 have the following expression on @xmath307 : @xmath824 and @xmath825 observe that the family @xmath826 coincides for @xmath538 with the one given by the deformation of the conical metric @xmath827 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the natural questions are then : does the noncommutative symbol @xmath574 give canonically a @xmath2-theory element of @xmath297 ? does the operator @xmath512 give canonically a @xmath2-homology class on @xmath11 ?",
    "are the corresponding classes poincar dual ?",
    "the answer to the first two questions is negative in general , but becomes affirmative under some conditions on the spectrum of @xmath819 and in that case the answer to the last question is affirmative too . let us explain these phenomena .",
    "firstly , the noncommutative symbol @xmath828 is fully elliptic if and only if @xmath829 we assume in the sequel that this condition is satisfied . using the ellipticity of @xmath746 as a pseudodifferential operator on @xmath735 and the invertibility of @xmath830 , we can proove thanks to @xcite that @xmath831 .",
    "this implies that the closure of @xmath832 as an unbounded operator on the @xmath298-hilbert module @xmath833 with domain @xmath834 is selfadoint , regular and provides an unbounded @xmath835-kasparov bimodule ( @xcite ) .",
    "we thus get here a well defined , canonical , element @xmath836\\in k^0(t^ { \\mathsf{s}}x)$ ] .",
    "we turn back now to the operators @xmath837 , @xmath838 .",
    "it is well known that they always have a selfadjoint extension , not unique in general ( @xcite ) .",
    "adpating for instance the computations of @xcite to our particular choice of hilbert space @xmath839 , we see that @xmath837 , @xmath538 , with domain @xmath840 is essentially self - adjoint if and only if @xmath841-\\frac{t}{2},\\frac{t}{2}[=\\emptyset$ ] . otherwise , any choice of an orthogonal decomposition of : @xmath842 where the @xmath843 s describe an orthonormal system of eigenvectors of @xmath819 , allows to define a self - adjoint extension of @xmath512 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath498 small enough , thanks to the assumption ( [ eq:0notinthespectrum ] ) , @xmath844 is essentially self - adjoint .",
    "it is also fredholm by ( @xcite ) , so @xmath845 gives an unbounded @xmath846-kasparov bimodule , in other words a @xmath2-homology class @xmath847\\in k_0(x)$ ] , and we have : @xmath848)=[\\sigma_x(t)]\\ ] ] to check this , one shows that the woronowicz transform @xmath849 ( @xcite ) of @xmath844 can be represented in @xmath2-homology by a zero order @xmath18-operator with noncommutative symbol equal to the woronowicz transform @xmath850 of @xmath832 , and then the theorem [ main - jml ] applies .    in particular : @xmath851)\\ ] ] in general , @xmath852 has several selfadjoint extensions , but using the splitness of @xmath853 one shows that two given selfadjoint extensions of @xmath512 give the same @xmath2-homology class if and only if their fredholm index is the same .",
    "thus a selfadjoint extension @xmath854 , given by a choice of a decomposition @xmath855 of ( [ eq : space - of - choices ] ) , produces the same @xmath2-homology class as @xmath844 ( and then , is poincar dual to its noncommutative symbol ) if and only if @xmath856 .",
    "let us say a word about the case @xmath857 . for small @xmath603 ,",
    "the selfadjoint extensions of @xmath837 are classified by the orthogonal decompositions of @xmath858 .",
    "there is a priori no canonical choice . on the other hand , the noncommutative symbol @xmath832 is not fully elliptic .",
    "we conjecture that the selfadjoint extensions of @xmath832 , as an unbounded operator on the hilbert module @xmath833 , are again classified by the orthogonal decomposition of @xmath858 and give unbounded kasparov modules which are in one - to - one correspondance , via poincar duality , with the selfadjoint extensions of @xmath837 .",
