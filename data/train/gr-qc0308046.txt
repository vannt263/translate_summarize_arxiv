    "we have investigated the dynamics of a braneworld with induced gravity , i.e. the dgp model . unlike the rsii braneworld , which modifies general relativity at early times and then recovers it at late times",
    ", the dgp braneworld is like general relativity in the early universe but modifies the dynamics at late times . the extra - dimensional gravity effect in the dgp ( @xmath173 ) model contributes to late - time acceleration , which provides a possible way to avoid dark energy .",
    "we used approximations to solve the dgp friedmann equation in both the early and late universe ( equations ( [ eppos1 ] ) , ( [ epneg1 ] ) and ( [ early ] ) ) .",
    "the conditions for acceleration in the dgp model were derived , equations ( [ dgpac ] ) , ( [ s1 ] ) and ( [ dgpepnegcon ] ) . at early times , the dgp friedmann equation approaches the standard general relativity limit .",
    "modifications appear at late times . when @xmath171 , the solutions give accelerating expansion at late time . on the other hand , when @xmath174 , the universe expands slower than standard cosmology .",
    "we analyzed the phase planes for a range of potentials used for inflation , quintessence and cold dark matter , and compared the dynamics in the dgp case to the rsii and standard cases .",
    "these phase planes show clearly the qualitatively different behavior of the dgp model .",
    "the phase space in the case of the potential @xmath175 $ ] , with various values of brane tension ( rsii braneworld ) and crossover scale ( dgp braneworld ) , showed how the standard cosmology scenario is approached in the limit .",
