    "galaxies like the draco dwarf spheroidal may be the building blocks of the universe ( koo 1994 ) .",
    "draco is among the faintest known galaxies and indeed , at @xmath2 , ranks among the middling globular clusters in luminosity .",
    "however , its very extended distribution of stars ( @xmath3 kpc ) clearly distinguishes it from the comparatively tightly condensed globulars .",
    "moreover , assuming dynamical equilibrium leads one to very high estimates for the mass - to - light ratio ( aaronson 1983 ) , with recent multifiber spectroscopy yielding a remarkable @xmath4 ( armandroff , olszewski , & pryor 1995 ) .",
    "if the dark matter is primarily stellar , as might be inferred from the findings of recent microlensing experiments , then the initial mass function ( imf ) in these galaxies might have been very different from the present - day imf in our own galaxy .",
    "it is clearly important to try to piece together the star formation histories of such galaxies as this may have important consequences for ideas concerning the formation and evolution of more luminous galaxies like our own .    the color - magnitude ( cm )",
    "diagram of the draco dwarf was first studied by baade & swope ( 1961 ) , and found to be generally similar to the cm - diagrams of metal - poor globular clusters with the exception of having a rather broad giant branch .",
    "baade & swope also first detected the `` anomalous '' cepheids , more luminous than the period - luminosity relation for type ii cepheids would predict , and now known to be characteristic of dwarf galaxies . another marked anomaly in the cm diagram is draco s red horizontal branch , which is incompatible with low metallicity in a population ii system ( the second parameter problem ) .",
    "this phenomenon alone could be taken to suggest that draco is @xmath5 years younger than classic , metal - poor globular clusters like m92 ( lee , demarque , & zinn 1994 ) .",
    "other hypotheses have been offered to explain the second parameter phenomenon ( renzini 1978 ) , and an increasing body of evidence suggests that age may be no more than a minor contributor to horizontal branch morphology ( stetson , vandenberg , & bolte 1996 ) . however , the debate is by no means settled , and the reader is referred to lee ( 1994 ) and chaboyer , demarque , & sarajedini ( 1996 ) for arguments in support of the age hypothesis .",
    "the best ground - based ccd cm diagrams of the draco dwarf spheroidal to date have been presented by stetson , vandenberg , & mcclure ( 1985 ) and carney & seitzer ( 1986 , hereafter cs86 ) . like the ursa minor dwarf spheroidal ( the 2nd - faintest dwarf spheroidal known )",
    ", draco appears to be as old as the oldest globular clusters , though cs86 and others discuss evidence from blue stragglers for an intermediate - age population as well .",
    "the superb resolution afforded by the wide field / planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ permits a remarkable improvement in our ability to study the stellar content of the draco dwarf spheroidal as well as other galaxies in the local group .",
    "here we describe the first results of an _ hst _ program to investigate the stellar population of this galaxy .",
    "the images we presently discuss were taken on june 9 , 1995 with wfpc2 .",
    "the region selected for wfpc2 imaging is shown overlaid on the digital sky survey in figure [ fig : plate1 ] ( plate 1 ) , and is roughly centered on field 1 of cs86 .",
    "one 200s and two 1000s exposures were taken in f606w ( @xmath6 ) , while the f814w ( @xmath7 ) images comprise 200s , 1100s , and 1300s integration time .",
    "f606w was chosen over f555w to give a somewhat higher signal - to - noise ratio . in the process of cosmic ray removal , the exposures in each filter were combined into single , composite images from which subsequent photometry was derived .",
    "a mosaic of the coadded wfpc2 frames in f814w is shown in figure [ fig : plate2 ] ( plate 2 ) .",
    "photometry on the three wide - field ( wf ) detectors ( 00996 pix@xmath8 ) was carried out using a combination of aperture photometry and allframe psf - fitting photometry ( stetson 1994 ) .",
    "allframe is the latest development in the daophot series of photometry packages and differs from its predecessors primarily in its ability to use information from many individual frames simultaneously to better constrain the final fitted magnitudes .",
    "allframe is applied to the data _ after _ object detection and aperture photometry is carried out using daophot ii ( stetson 1987 ) .    to push the star detection limit to as faint a level as possible , we coadded all images taken through the _ same _ filter . coadding the f606w and f814w images",
    "prior to object detection might in principle seem to offer an even fainter detection limit , but doing so would have severely compromised the reliability of subsequent completeness determinations .",
    "two daophot detection passes were carried out , separated by photometry and subtraction of all stars found in the first pass .",
    "faint stars hidden within the psf skirts of brighter companions were thereby revealed and subsequently added to the list of detected stars to be measured .",
    "point - spread functions for each detector and each filter were constructed within daophot using the @xmath9 brightest and most isolated point sources in each frame .",
    "allframe was then applied to the f606w and f814w images simultaneously .",
    "a total of 4429 stars were ultimately detected and measured in the three wf frames .    due to the degree of undersampling and relatively poor psf representation in the wf chips ,",
    "psf - fitting of brighter stars is subject to greater uncertainties in the absence of crowding than is pure synthetic - aperture photometry .",
    "however , crowding and poor signal - to - noise ratio become ever increasing problems as one considers fainter and fainter stars , and the allframe - derived magnitudes yield a tighter main sequence than is obtainable using aperture photometry . in order to retain the small uncertainties associated with aperture photometry of bright , uncrowded giants and to simultaneously extend the main sequence as far as possible",
    ", the color - magnitude diagram was constructed using both aperture and psf - fitted magnitudes .",
    "the aperture magnitudes were used whenever the predicted total light within an aperture of radius 2 pixels from all other resolved stars ( based on the known characteristics of the wfpc2 psf ) within 2@xmath10 was less than 1% of the light from the star centered in the aperture .",
    "corrections to a 05 aperture were made in each case , and the synthetic zero points of holtzman ( 1995 ) were used to compute wfpc2-system magnitudes .",
    "completeness tests were carried out by adding @xmath11 stars at a time to each of the f606w and f814w images .",
    "stars were added in integer ",
    "f814w steps , and with f606w - f814w @xmath12 mag .",
    "the frames were then processed using daophot ii and allframe in a manner identical to that applied to the original data .",
    "the results of these tests are shown in figure [ fig : completeness ] , which shows that the 50% completeness level occurs at f814w @xmath13 .",
    "the faintest stars we can reliably measure therefore have masses of @xmath14 .",
    "the tests also show that the photometric uncertainties are @xmath15 mag rms at f814w = 23 , and @xmath16 mag rms at f814w = 25 .",
    "the f814w vs f606w ",
    "f814w color - magnitude ( cm ) diagram , constructed using both aperture photometry for uncrowded stars ( 269 ) and allframe fits for crowded stars ( 4156 ) is shown in figure [ fig : cm ] .",
    "an electronic version of the photometry table is available on request from cjg .",
    "the morphology in figure [ fig : cm ] above the turnoff is very similar to that found by stetson ( 1985 ) and cs86 .",
    "owing to the superior resolution afforded by the _ hst _",
    "data , we are able to extend the main sequence 2 magnitudes fainter than these ground - based studies . the turnoff region is well resolved and reveals that the bluest main - sequence stars have = 0.36 .",
    "there are evidently fewer blue stragglers than in the cm diagram of cs86 , consistent with a ratio of @xmath17 in field of view .",
    "unlike cs86 , we see no evidence for distinct multiple turnoffs ; most of the stars within the wfpc2 field of view appear to be approximately coeval .",
    "we caution however that , while our photometry may be more accurate , we have sampled only one fifth as many stars in the turnoff region as have cs86 , and it may be premature to rule out the multiple turnoffs in draco .",
    "additional wfpc2 fields of draco will be required before we can seriously address this issue .      in figure",
    "[ fig : cmtracks ] we compare the draco cm diagram with fiducial sequences for the galactic globular clusters m68 ( walker 1994 ) and m92 ( heasley & janes 1996 ) , which have [ fe / h ] = -2.09 and -2.24 dex , respectively ( djorgovski 1993 ) .",
    "the draco magnitudes have been dereddened assuming e(_b - v _ ) = 0.03 ( stetson 1979a ) using the absorptions tabulated by holtzman ( 1995 ) for stars of k5 spectral type .",
    "the globular sequences were dereddened and translated using the color excesses and distances tabulated by peterson ( 1993 ) .",
    "a mean abundance for giants in draco has been spectroscopically measured to be [ fe / h ] @xmath18 dex ( lehnert 1992 ) . adopting a mean horizontal branch magnitude @xmath19 ( stetson 1979a ) , e@xmath20 = 0.03 ( stetson 1979b ) , and @xmath21 = 0.15 [ fe / h ] + 0.82 ( carney 1992 )",
    ", we use @xmath22 the isochrones shown in figure [ fig : cmtracks ] are from vandenberg & bell ( 1985 ) , with colors from the @xmath23 vs @xmath24 relations for dwarfs of johnson ( 1966 ) , and for giants of ridgway ( 1980 ) .",
    "@xmath23 colors have been transformed to @xmath25 empirically and in the correct metallicity regime via the preliminary multimetallicity color - color diagrams of worthey & fisher ( 1996 ) , and @xmath25 have in turn been converted to f606w  f814w using the transformation equations in holtzman ( 1995 ) .",
    "a sequence of normal points representing the color - magnitude sequence was generated by defining an inclusion envelope around the main sequence , sub - giant , and giant branches , and computing mean magnitudes and colors in 0.4 magnitude - wide bands . due to the scarcity of giant branch stars and the associated large uncertainties in their mean colors ,",
    "the locus of the giant branch above f814w = 20.5 was estimated by eye .",
    "this sequence , resampled using spline fits , was then compared using a maximum - likelihood technique with isochrones ranging in age from 12 to 18 gyrs , and in [ fe / h ] ranging from -1.2 to -2.2 .",
    "the normal points were uniformly weighted , and the best - fitting isochrone had an age of 16 gyrs and [ fe / h ] = -2.2 . given the weighting of the data , a formal @xmath26 estimate of the uncertainty was not straightforward , and the fitting uncertainty was instead estimated by generating one hundred realizations of the sequence of normal points ( using gaussian deviates based on the dispersion in the mean colors in each magnitude bin ) and comparing them to each of the isochrones .",
    "this yielded an age uncertainty , based purely on random and fitting errors , of 0.5 gyr .    shown in figure [ fig : cmtracks ]",
    "are isochrones corresponding to an age of 16 gyr and [ fe / h ] ranging from -1.2 to -2.2 dex .",
    "an age of 16 gyrs is not atypical of ages found for several metal - poor galactic globular clusters using this set of isochrones .",
    "however , despite the small uncertainty due to random effects , it is apparent from figure [ fig : cmtracks ] that there are clear , systematic differences between the isochrones and the data .",
    "whereas the fiducial sequences of m68 and m92 agree reasonably well with the cm distribution of draco stars , the isochrones generally appear too red , particularly along the giant branch .",
    "this is undoubtedly due in large part to the roundabout technique used above to transform values of @xmath24 to f606w ",
    "f814w colors .",
    "given the numerous calibrations involved and the systematic discrepancies which can arise , it is clearly dangerous to place much faith in the age we derive using this method .    a _ calibration - independent _ method for measuring relative ages ) , then the _ absolute _ ages of the globular clusters ( and draco ) are reduced by @xmath0 gyrs .",
    "] has been described by vandenberg , bolte , & stetson ( 1990 ) .",
    "this involves measuring the difference in color between the turnoff and the giant branch , which is relatively insensitive to metallicity but is a monotonic function of age . in figure",
    "[ fig : cmaligned ] we show the fiducial sequence for draco ( generated as described above ) compared with similar sequences for the galactic globular clusters m68 and m92 . also shown",
    "are isochrones having [ fe / h ] = -2.0 and ages ranging from 13 to 18 gyr .",
    "the globular cluster sequences and the isochrones have been shifted horizontally to match the draco sequence at the bluest point of the turnoff region , and vertically to agree with one another at a point 0.05 magnitudes redward of the turnoff on the main sequence .",
    "the draco sequence evidently agrees very well with the globular cluster sequences , though there are small differences in the shape of the turnoff and the slope of the giant branch .",
    "the relative ages between sequences are best measured in this technique by comparing the colors of the giant branch , where the color separation is largly independent of magnitude .",
    "looking at the isochrone spacing , it is evident that the color difference between giant branches is not uniform , but depends on absolute age .",
    "if we calibrate age differences using the oldest ( leftmost ) two isochrones , then the mean color difference measured in the region 20 @xmath27 f814w @xmath27 21 ( below the hb and in a region where the giant branch is relatively well sampled ) yields a relative age difference between draco and either of the globular clusters of considerably less than one gyr .",
    "note that using increasingly younger isochrones to establish the color difference  age calibration would reduce the inferred age differences even more .",
    "given the photometric scatter apparent on the main sequence , the presence of blue stragglers or large numbers of binary stars could conceivably affect the determination of the mean colors of the turnoff and the main sequence . to estimate our sensitivity to these effects ,",
    "we have recomputed the draco normal points using an inclusion envelope alternately more exclusive of stars on the blue side of the turnoff and on the red side of the main sequence . in the latter case , we have excluded approximately three times as many outliers to the red of the main sequence as to the blue .",
    "using these computed normal sequences ( in addition to a number of hand - sketched realizations ) and bringing all other sequences into alignment as before , we estimate our measuring uncertainty to be @xmath28 gyr .",
    "the distribution of relative ages measured in this way is slightly asymmetric in the sense that an older draco is preferred over a younger .",
    "additional uncertainty arises from possible errors in the color terms used to transform between photometric systems .",
    "two such color terms are used here : the term used to transform the ground - based data into v - i , and that used to transform v - i to f606w - f814w . the close similarity in age",
    "we infer for m68 and m92 agrees with the results of vandenberg et al .",
    "( 1990 ) based on independent b , v data sets and suggests that errors in the ground - based color terms are likely to be small .",
    "errors in the transformation from v - i to f606w - f814w arise from inaccuracies in the fitting formula used on the synthetic photometry results and from the error made by applying a transformation based on stars of solar metallicity to a metal - poor population .",
    "we estimate that fitting errors would introduce an error of order 0.02 magnitudes in the difference in color between the turnoff and the giant branch .",
    "this translates to an age uncertainty of about 2.3 gyrs .",
    "applying transformation coefficients based on solar - metallicity stars to the more metal - poor stars of m68 and m92 has the effect of making the globular cluster giant branches in figure [ fig : cmaligned ] appear somewhat bluer relative to draco than they should . using kurucz model atmospheres , we find that stars at the turnoff and on the giant branch are fainter in f606w by 0.014 and 0.024 magnitudes , respectively , than what we compute using the holtzman ( 1995 ) coefficients .",
    "the f814w transformation for these stars is much less sensitive to metallicity , and we estimate that the differences in f606w - f814w color between the turnoffs and the giant branches of m68 and m92 should be about 0.014 magnitudes larger than shown . correcting our measured result accordingly and combining the two major sources of error above , we conclude that draco is @xmath1 gyrs older than either m68 or m92 .    given the very different horizontal branch morphologies of draco and the two globular clusters , what can we say about the 2nd parameter problem ?",
    "in figure [ fig : ldz ] we partially reproduce the [ fe / h ] vs. hb morphology diagram of lee ( 1994 ) .",
    "we have determined the morphological type quantity ( b - r)/(b+v+r ) for draco using the color - magnitude diagrams of both stetson ( 1979a ) and cs86 .",
    "counting stars on the blue and red sides of the instability strip as well as likely rr lyrae variables , we find ( b - r)/(b+v+r ) = -.77 and -0.70 for the two data sets , respectively .",
    "we plot the mean of these two values in figure [ fig : ldz ] along with similar quantities tabulated by lee ( 1994 ) for m68 and m92 . for both uniform mass - loss models and models",
    "in which the mass - loss rate increases with age ( reimers 1977 ) , the draco point appears to fall about 2 gyr below the isochrone which best matches m68 and m92 .",
    "as this is only 1.4@xmath29 our estimated age uncertainty , we can not completely rule out consistency between draco and an age - dependent hb morphology of the type modeled by lee .",
    "wfpc2 photometry of old globular clusters , sufficient to reduce the relative age uncertainty to  @xmath30 gyr , will be required before we can put firmer constraints on the models .",
    "zinn ( 1978 ) and lehnert ( 1992 ) have demonstrated an abundance spread of approximately 1 dex in draco . aside from this chemical inhomogeneity ,",
    "how well does the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy fit the _ simple stellar population _ paradigm of renzini & buzzoni ( 1986 ) ?",
    "we have seen that the turnoff cm diagram morphology of draco is very similar to that of m92 ; globular clusters are the prototype simple stellar populations , coeval systems of initially homogeneous composition .",
    "clearly , draco is predominantly a simple stellar population originating as early as anything in the galaxy .",
    "close examination of the cm diagram shows a significant population of blue stragglers ( see also cs86 ) .",
    "such stars are often seen in simple stellar populations , including both ancient globular and younger open star clusters , but they can also result from an @xmath31 star formation history .",
    "we can count them in color profiles ( figure [ fig : color ] ) formed out of half - magnitude strips from the turnoff region .",
    "the surface density of foreground stars in this region of the cm diagram ( specifically a region 0.3 magnitudes wide in color and 2 magnitudes high in f606w ) is predicted by the galactic model of bahcall and soneira ( 1980 ) to be 17 per square degree .",
    "thus , there is only a 2% probability of finding a single foreground star among the @xmath32 stars we identify as blue stragglers ( roughly speaking , those stars with f814w @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) .",
    "there are between 60 and 70 stars in the same region ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) of the cm diagram of cs86 .",
    "given that the area surveyed by cs86 is about 5 times that of the area covered by our wfpc2 field , a ratio of @xmath37 in the number of blue stragglers indicates reasonable agreement .",
    "simulations of the turnoff region using the yale isochrones ( green , demarque & king 1984 ) require 6% of the mass to be contained in a second population , half the age of the primary population , in order to fully account for the blue stragglers in figure [ fig : cm ] .",
    "we note that 6% is an upper limit on the size of a second younger component of draco , since blue stragglers can be an intrinsic part of a simple stellar population .",
    "a putative extended star formation history strengthens the link between draco and more fully developed examples of this phenomenon , such as carina ( smecker - hane 1994 ; 1996 ) .",
    "the difference between draco and carina and galaxies such as lgs 3 ( mould 1997 ) which are still forming stars today ( at 10% of the original rate in the latter case ) is then simply one of degree .",
    "draco simply had a shorter tail to its initial burst of star formation .",
    "there is considerable evidence that wind - induced mass - loss can not account for the stellar populations seen in several local group dwarfs , and that stripping or capture of gas must have occurred ( see gallagher & wyse 1994 for a review ) .",
    "draco is currently among the nearest of the dwarf galaxies and , if its orbit is largely contained within its present distance , the probability of capturing significant amounts of rejuvenating circumgalactic gas may be substantially smaller than for dwarfs in the outskirts of the local group . alternatively , a high ultraviolet flux from the precursors to the galaxy and m31 may have removed substantially more gas from the nearby dwarfs ( van den bergh 1994 ) .",
    "none of these remarks bear at all on the better - known curious phenomenon of draco s red horizontal branch .",
    "the finding that draco is as old or older than m92 requires us to focus on the problem of understanding draco s rhb .",
    "higher s / n ( and preferably f555w ",
    "f814w ) photometry performed differentially with respect to [ fe / h ] = 2 clusters have the potential to sharpen our conclusions further .",
    "if the relative age uncertainty could be reduced to 0.5 gyr , one would have to turn to parameters such as cluster density ( e.g. fusi pecci 1996 ) as the second parameter in the globular cluster system .",
    "the age spread of the halo , which is the defining feature of the searle & zinn ( 1978 ) galaxy formation scenario ( as opposed to eggen , lynden - bell , & sandage 1962 ) would then need to be defined by the ages of the low density element of the halo , namely draco , its sibling dwarf spheroidals , and the galactic bulge .",
    "figure [ fig : lf ] shows the differential luminosity function ( lf ) for the stars in our sample .",
    "also shown is a lf computed from walker s ( 1994 ) photometry of m68 .",
    "no completeness corrections have been applied to the m68 data , and the counts have been arbitrarily normalized to our data at f814w = 23 .",
    "note that the number of measured stars in the m68 sample is about @xmath38 larger than in the draco sample .",
    "the draco lf appears to be somewhat steeper on the giant branch , and somewhat shallower below the turnoff .",
    "uncertainties introduced by differences in noise characteristics , resolution , and detection efficiency make it difficult to draw firm conclusions but , over the ( admittedly narrow ) mass range considered here , there does not appear to be an obvious bias towards lower - mass stars which might be held to account for the very high estimates of draco s mass - to - light ratio .",
    "based on the present data set , all we can say is that if the bulk of the matter is in the form of stars , such stars must have masses less than @xmath39 .",
    "the observed lf can be used to place limits on the initial mass function ( imf ) in draco .",
    "the current observations are of stars with masses between 0.6 and 0.9 .",
    "we parameterize the imf in this mass range by a simple power law , with @xmath40 .",
    "even stars of this low mass evolve significantly over a hubble time , so the inferred imf slope depends on the age of the stellar population in draco .",
    "we construct model lfs using a variety of imfs and compare each model distribution with the observed one to see if it is plausible that they are drawn from the same parent population .",
    "the construction of model lfs allows us to incorporate photometric errors ( both random and systematic ) and incompleteness into the analysis ; the incompleteness and errors which we apply to the model lfs are those determined from our artificial star experiments .",
    "we can also include the effect of a binary star contribution if we make an assumption about the frequency and distribution of the relative masses of stars in binary pairs .",
    "for draco , we assume a metallicity of [ fe / h]=-2 , a distance and extinction as quoted above , and use vandenberg ( 1983 ) isochrones ( from which worthey s models are derived for low mass stars ) along with kurucz model atmospheres to convert from masses to assumed luminosities .    we define as unacceptable imf slopes for which the model lf and the observed lf are inconsistent with each other at the 95% confidence level as determined by a kolmogorov - smirnoff test . with this definition ,",
    "we constrain the imf slope to fall within the range    @xmath41 for an assumed age of 18 gyr ,    @xmath42 for an assumed age of 15 gyr ,    @xmath43 for an age of 12 gyr , and    @xmath44 for an age of 10 gyr    when we fit the f606w lf over the range @xmath45 with stellar models of a single metallicity , [ fe / h]=-2 .",
    "the dependence on age is easy to understand : as a population evolves , the lf around the turnoff steepens , leading to a flatter inferred imf for an older population .",
    "these results were derived assuming a binary fraction of 0.5 with uncorrelated masses of the binary stars ; with no binaries , we get slopes which are slightly shallower .",
    "similarly , small variations on the above allowed ranges are derived with different assumptions about the metallicity , distance , and/or a different adopted magnitude range over which the comparison with the observed lf is made .",
    "if we fit the f814w lf , we infer a range of possible imf slopes which are slightly steeper than those inferred from the f606w lf . for no binaries , the inferred slope range overlaps between the two bandpasses ; for a binary fraction of 0.5 , all of the acceptable imf slopes for f814w are steeper than those allowed by the f606w lf .    for comparison ,",
    "the imf in this mass range in the solar neighborhood is proportional to @xmath46 ( kroupa , tout , & gilmore 1993 ) .",
    "the allowed slopes for draco are remarkably similar to this value .",
    "based on photometry of wfpc2 images of the draco dwarf spheroidal , we conclude the following :    * draco is predominantly an old system , being @xmath47 gyrs older than either m68 or m92 . *",
    "we see no evidence for multiple turnoffs which would be indicative of episodic star formation . *",
    "the presence of significant numbers of blue stragglers _ may _ indicate an extended period of star formation , though the numbers of younger stars @xmath48% of the first generation . *",
    "the luminosity function looks in all respects nearly identical to that of the old globular cluster m68 . *",
    "the slope of the initial mass function appears to be very similar to that of the imf determined for the solar neighborhood .",
    "future work should be aimed at refining the relative ages of draco and blue horizontal branch clusters like m92 .",
    "obtaining both higher signal - to - noise ratio data as well as wfpc color - magnitude diagrams of metal poor globular clusters should allow us to reduce the relative age uncertainty to @xmath49 gyr .",
    "such data would considerably strengthen constraints on the process and mechanisms which led to the formation of our galaxy .",
