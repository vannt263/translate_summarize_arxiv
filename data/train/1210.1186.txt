    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are a potential source of astrophysical high energy neutrinos which are currently being investigated with icecube .",
    "the standard grb internal shock scenario of neutrino production @xcite used so far to compare against the icecube 40 string and 40 + 59 string observations @xcite assumed some simplifications in the neutrino physics .",
    "also , the astrophysical model itself of the grb prompt gamma - ray emission based on the same internal shocks has been the subject of discussions in the gamma - ray community @xcite , due to issues with the radiation efficiency and the spectral properties in the standard version of this internal shock scenario .    for this reason , modified internal shock models that address these issues ( e.g. @xcite ) as well as alternative models where the prompt gamma - ray emission arises in the jet photosphere",
    "have been considered ( e.g. @xcite . in such photospheric models",
    "the high radiative efficiency is due to dissipation processes in it .",
    "a separate question that has also been the subject of debate in the astrophysics community is whether the jets in such relativistic sources are dominated by the baryons or by magnetic fields , which imply different macroscopic acceleration rates , different proper densities in the jet rest - frame , and implying a major role for magnetic dissipation in the process of particle acceleration .",
    "such magnetically dominated jets in grbs have been investigated by @xcite and others , and the gamma - ray emission is ascribed in such models , again , to dissipative processes mainly in the photosphere , e.g. @xcite .",
    "it is unclear at present whether the above mentioned modified internal shocks or the photospheric models are best for interpreting the prompt gamma - ray emission , nor whether the jet dynamics is dominated by baryonic or magnetic stresses ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the expected neutrino emission is strongly dependent on the specific overarching dissipation and dynamic model of grbs . for this reason , here",
    "we explore the neutrino features of the three main types of models which are currently under consideration .",
    "we illustrate the variety of astrophysical uncertainties involved in these models , and how these can affect the expectations for detection with icecube or future instruments .",
    "in the typical grb model a high energy - to - mass ratio , jet - like relativistic outflow is launched which initially accelerates with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath0 , averaged over the jet cross section , whose dependence on distance from the center of the explosion can be parametrized as    @xmath1    this behavior is assumed valid up to a saturation radius @xmath2 , where the lorentz factor has reached the asymptotic value @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the dimensionless entropy of the outflow , @xmath5 and @xmath6 being the average energy and mass flux .",
    "the index @xmath7 ranges between the extreme @xmath8 magnetically dominated radial outflow and the usual @xmath9 baryonically dominated outflow regimes , e.g. @xcite . in the extreme magnetic case and baryonic cases , the saturation radius is given by    @xmath10    in the dissipative photospheric scenario , a fraction of the outflow bulk kinetic energy is converted into radiation energy via some dissipation mechanism in the neighborhood of the photosphere . , giving rise to the  prompt \" photon luminosity @xmath11 , where @xmath12 erg / s is the isotropic equivalent total luminosity of the jet . the photospheric radius is estimated by setting the thomson optical depth @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the comoving density of electrons if the @xmath15 pairs are absent if baryonic dissipation is via @xmath16 colissions @xcite . in  [ sec : diffuse ] we exemplify the effects of the effective photospheric radius being larger . ] . by using eqn.[eq : gamma ] and the condition above , we obtain    @xmath17    @xcite , where    @xmath18    typically , for a magnetically dominated @xmath8 case the photosphere occurs in the acceleration phase @xmath19 , if @xmath20 , where @xmath21 . on the other hand",

    "a fraction @xmath30 of @xmath34 is assumed to be dissipated , consuming a fraction from each of the toroidal field and bulk proton energy , and resulting in proton internal energy and in a fraction @xmath31 which appears as random magnetic fields , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 which appear as relativistic protons and relativistic electrons . in both baryonic and magnetically dominated cases",
    "we assume @xmath35 , and we take @xmath36 and @xmath37 as examples in this paper . in the jet comoving frame the random magnetic field",

    "this spectral shape is the product of the modification of a thermal spectrum by the dissipation . for the purposes of this article , we treat this photon spectrum as the input for our calculations , transformed to the rest frame of the outflow .",
    "while the bulk lorentz factors in the photosphere and internal shock models may differ , for the purposes of comparison we adopt here as a test case the same comoving frame photon spectral break energy for the dissipation zones of the various models considered , @xmath49 mev , and @xmath50 below @xmath51 and @xmath47 above @xmath51 .",
    "the lower and upper branches can have cut - off energies , e.g. determined by synchrotron self - absorption below and acceleration restrictions or @xmath52 pair production above , the cut - off values depending on the specific model and its parameters . for simplicity , here we adopt the same constant values of a lower limit @xmath53 ev and an upper limit @xmath54 mev , which are adequate for our purposes since the neutrino results are insensitive to these values .",

    "the turbulent magnetic fields generated in these external shocks lead to synchrotron radiation , as well as synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) and external inverse compton ( eic ) scattering of non - thermal photons from the dissipation region near the photosphere or the internal shocks .",
    "the detailed method of calculation of these photon spectra are discussed in @xcite . as shown below , however , the neutrino fluence from the external shock region is a few orders of magnitude lower than that from the photospheric or baryonic internal shock regions , due to a much lower photon density leading to a lower interaction rate and lower pion production efficiency . under the assumptions made here ,",
    "the input photon spectrum of a grb with typical parameters is shown in fig.[fig:1 ] as an example .",

    "in the baryonic dissipation regions , whether these are in the photosphere or in internal shocks beyond the photosphere , it is usually assumed that protons , as well as electrons , are accelerated through a fermi - first order ( fermi - i ) acceleration mechanism in the disordered magnetic fields created in the region . a process similar to fermi acceleration is also expected in magnetic reconnection regions where layers of magnetic field of opposite polarity meet and drive converging flows .",

    "an interesting possibility in the case of magnetic dissipation regions , e.g. due to reconnection , is that they may produce an an accelerated proton spectrum which is harder than the typical fermi case of @xmath195 . as discussed by @xcite for an extreme case all the protons entering the acceleration process",
    "are essentially confined by the magnetic field and the zero escape probability leads to a spectrum @xmath196 .",
    "if this scenario is valid , the bulk of the energy for the accelerated protons is concentrated in the high energy end of their injection spectrum .",
    "the neutrino energy associated with these protons lies in the pev - eev energy range .",
    "this energy is in the sensitivity range of icecube and proposed arianna neutrino detector .",
    "however this scenario requires significant magnetic reconnection process where the toroidal magnetic field is still present . charged pions and muons at this energy suffer strong synchrotron cooling which suppresses the neutrino spectrum significantly .",
    "therefore , no significant neutrino emission is expected from this scenario ( since at lower energies there are too few protons due to the nature of a @xmath196 spectrum . )",
    "since the individual source fluxes are very low , except for the unlikely event of an extremely nearby occurrence , it is useful to consider the cumulative diffuse neutrino flux from all grbs in the sky .",
    "we calculate this diffuse flux based on two methods .",
    "method - i uses a grb luminosity distribution ( luminosity function ) and a redshift distribution @xcite , given , respectively , by    @xmath197    @xmath198    here @xmath59 is the peak photon luminosity ( here mostly in the 0.1 - 1 mev range ) and we have used the following values : @xmath199 erg / s , @xmath200 erg / s , @xmath201 erg / s , @xmath202 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 which are best fit values used in @xcite . the differential comoving rate of grbs at a redshift @xmath131 is    @xmath207    where v(z ) is the comoving volume in the standard @xmath151 cosmology given by parameters in eqn.[eq : lcdm ] and the factor ( 1+z ) accounts for time dilation effect due to cosmic expansion .",
    "the differential number of grb per unit redshift is given by    @xmath208    where @xmath209 is the local rate , the number of grbs which meet this criteria is about @xmath210 which is a reasonable all sky rate .",
    "] of high luminosity grbs ( not including a separate family of objects called low luminosity grbs @xcite ) .",

    "we consider only long grbs and use the parameters such as the band photon index , fluence , redshift , photon peak energy etc . to compute the neutrino spectrum from each individual burst and stack them together .",
    "finally we normalize the resultant flux to an all sky rate of 700 grbs / yr .",
    "these two methods are then used to calculate the diffuse neutrino flux assuming that the grb neutrinos are due to a magnetic photosphere , a baryonic photosphere , and an internal shock model ( fig.[fig:6],[fig:7 ] ) . in fig.[fig:6 ] we plot those cases with @xmath70 while in fig.[fig:7 ] @xmath170 .",
    "an inspection of this fig.[fig:6],[fig:7 ] ( lower panel ) shows that the above models , with the parameters used in this paper , predict a diffuse neutrino flux which is likely to be within the current constraints set by icecube 40 + 59 string observations , as suggested by the fact that they lie below the two icecube constraint lines labeled wb for ic and ic 40 + 59 .",
    "a caveat is that these constraints are upper limits on the flux as a function of the break energy assuming a band function with @xmath213 , or assuming a slope -2 .",
    "they are not directly applicable to other types of spectra ; thus , these constraint lines are here intended only for a rough comparison ; they would have to be re - evaluated for the spectra shown here .",
    "nonetheless , they do provide some guidance , and it appears that the only models which are close to being constrained at present are those using the most optimistic parameters ; e.g. for internal shock models with a @xmath171 ms one would expect a small dissipation radius leading to a high @xmath214 and a high neutrino fluence in the lower energy range from @xmath92 collisions ( where @xmath215 has saturated to unity with @xmath214 increasing , making @xmath92 collisions more important . ) also , if we were to assume a higher value of @xmath216 , such as 10 ( in this paper we used a value of @xmath217 , see also section .",
    "[ sec : single ] ) and/or if we were to adopt a lower magnetic field fraction ( @xmath218 , rather than the @xmath219 used here ) , the diffuse neutrino fluence would be likely to violate the above constraints , especially for the internal shock model .",
    "however , this is for the optimistic internal shock case where one uses @xmath171 ms , whereas there is a larger uncertainty in this quantity , and in most bursts @xmath142 can often be several orders or magnitude larger ( see comments in the third paragraph of  [ sec : single ] ) .",
    "for such larger ( and more reasonable ) values of @xmath142 the model would appear to be still compatible with the constraints , even if a high @xmath216 ratio were assumed .",
    "we have also included the approximate atmospheric neutrino background in fig.[fig:6],[fig:7 ] .",
    "it is worth noting that grbs are transient sources whose prompt emission duration in the observer frame is within @xmath220 s. the angular resolution for tev neutrino and above is within @xmath221 .",
    "therefore , considering the search time bin and the small solid angle set by optical observations , the effective atmospheric neutrino background is well below these grb diffuse fluxes .",
    "in other words , even one or two muon events in icecube correlated with photon detections would give a high signal to noise ratio .    a caveat for such calculations of the diffuse background",
    "is that the statistical description of both the source physics parameters and the spatial - temporal distribution of the sources has large uncertainties ; this applies to both the luminosity function ( method i ) and the observed burst catalog ( method ii ) . in method - i , the parameters in eqns .",
    "( [ eq : lf ] , [ eq : zdist ] ) have large uncertainties ; especially in the low redshift region ( e.g. @xmath222 ) , very few grbs are observed .",
    "however , in order to expect more than one muon event in icecube , we need a grb of moderate or high luminosity located at low redshift ( such as the example grb in fig.[fig:4 ] with @xmath223 erg / s and @xmath150 , which results in about 0.2 muon events in the icecube 86-string configuration . )",
    "the estimated rate of grbs which satisfy @xmath224 is about @xmath225 per ten years . in method - ii",
    ", we actually have a very limited number of grbs with well measured redshifts in the catalog . those without a redshift",
    "are assigned a default redshift value of @xmath226 .",
    "thus , improvements in the photon - based statistics of bursts , as well as neutrino observations over multi - year periods appear required .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath227 signatures expected from photospheric grb models where the dynamics is either magnetically or baryonically dominated , including also the effects of external shocks , and have compared these signatures with those expected from the baryonic internal shock models .",
    "this comparison is timely in view of recent developments , the most pressing being the recently published icecube constraints @xcite on the  standard \" internal shock grb models .",
    "the exploration of alternative models to the internal shocks has its own separate motivation , independently of the icecube observations .",
    "one reason is the increased realization that magnetic fields may play a dominant role in the grb phenomenon , and the dynamics of magnetically dominated grb jet models are being considered in detail @xcite . also , issues related to the efficiency and spectrum of standard internal shock models of the prompt @xmath178-ray emission @xcite have led , on the one hand , to considering modified internal shock models that address these issues , e.g.@xcite , etc . , and , on the other hand , to considering the photospheric emission as the source of the prompt @xmath178-rays , including both baryonic photospheres @xcite and magnetic photospheres @xcite . some previous calculations of neutrino spectra from baryonically dominated photospheres have been carried out @xcite , but so far none from dissipative photospheres or magnetic photospheres , which we treat here    one of the notable features about the neutrino emission from dissipative photosphere models , both in magnetized of baryonic dynamics , is that the peak energy of the spectrum ( which is around 0.5 - 1 pev , as seen in fig . [ fig:3 ] ) differs from the peak energies of a typical waxman - bahcall ( wb97)@xcite simplified standard internal shock model such as used in the recent icecube studies ( and in @xcite ) .",
    "the peak energy is also higher than those for the internal shock model with @xmath228 and @xmath70 , but lower than those with higher @xmath142 and @xmath130 values . in part , this is due to the inclusion , in addition to @xmath134 resonance production , also of multi - pion effects , kaon decay , etc . , which also gives a steeper spectrum above the peak , compared to the flat slope of @xmath229 above the peak expected in the usual wb97 internal shock model .",
    "this steepening of the spectrum above the peak is not unique to the photospheric dissipation model , it occurs also in internal shocks when we include the above additional physics beyond the @xmath134-resonance , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "( such a steepening for internal shocks is also found by @xcite ) .    the energy at which the spectral peak appears depends generically on the radius of the dissipative and photon escape zones , which here we have assumed to be colocated , whether it be a photosphere or an internal shock .",
    "the effect of different radii is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , which compares the spectra and peak energies of different photospheric dissipation zones at different radii and also two internal shocks at two different radii ( or variability times ) .",
    "the harder spectra from larger radii are expected because of the decrease of the magnetic fields and and photon densities , which allows the higher energy secondary pions and muons to decay before significant electromagnetic cooling has taken place .",
    "the difference between a magnetically dominated photosphere ( m , ph ) , a baryonically dominated photosphere ( b , ph ) and internal shock ( is ) models are compared in fig.[fig:4],[fig:5 ] , fig.[fig:6],[fig:7](upper panel ) and table.[tbl:1 ] .",
    "the dissipation region for the ` m , ph ' typically lies in the acceleration phase of the jet where there is a smaller @xmath230 than ` b , ph ' and ` is ' model .",
    "the neutrino spectrum in the observer frame is affected by the efficiency of @xmath92 and @xmath68 interaction , the cooling of the secondary charged particles ( which is mainly synchrotron , determined by the comoving magnetic field ) and finally lorentz boost and redshift .",
    "the differences in neutrino spectra from these models are not quite significant for @xmath70 where the dissipation region , magnetic field and lorentz factor are similar . for @xmath170 ,",
    "the ` b , ph ' and ` is ' have harder spectra than the ` m , ph ' model .",
    "the ` b , ph ' radius here is rather small where @xmath92 , @xmath68 and coolings are all efficient .",
    "the large lorentz boost factor finally pushes the peak neutrino energy in the observer frame over the ` m , ph ' model . for ` is ' model with @xmath170 the dissipation radii is much larger than ` m , ph ' and ` b , ph ' case .",
    "the inefficient cooling results in the highest peak energy of the three models . however , the flux is also the lowest because @xmath92 and @xmath68 are the least efficient of these models .",
    "the maximum source - frame energy of the accelerated protons which are able to escape the acceleration region , for the models considered here , are shown in the third from the last column of table.[tbl:1 ] . leaving out any consideration of the diffuse flux",
    ", it is seen that only the internal shock models approach the highest energies associated with the gzk limit , as originally suggested by @xcite , while all photospheric models fall several orders of magnitude below this energy .",
    "we have not done an exhaustive parameter search , since our emphasis has been the neutrino emission , but it is apparent that photospheric models would not be competitive gzk sources .",
    "the detection of neutrinos from individual single sources with the 86 string icecube , as seen from table.[tbl:1 ] in the last two columns , is rather difficult , the number of expected muon events at best being @xmath231 for a magnetic photosphere model of average luminosity at @xmath150 .",
    "the only hope may be the statistically rare observation of a nearby bright grb , or through observations of the diffuse flux .    the diffuse flux offers higher prospects for an eventual detection , and a comparison of the diffuse flux expected from the three different types of models discussed , figs .",
    "[ fig:6 ] and [ fig:7 ] lower panels , shows that an internal shock scenario with optimistic parameters such as @xmath232 and @xmath70 comes closest to being constrained by the current icecube limits @xcite .",
    "this confirms the recent calculations of @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a magnetic photosphere model is far from being constrained by the current limits ( although the limits will have to be re - evaluated for the specific spectral shapes ) .",
    "a baryonic dissipative photosphere model has an even lower flux , and would take the longest to be detected .",
    "fig.[fig:7 ] shows that a higher lorentz factor , in this case @xmath170 , decreases the constraints .",
    "the diffuse flux from a magnetic photosphere is the least affected , and both baryonic photosphere and internal shock models have higher peak energy but lower flux .    in conclusion ,",
    "the calculations discussed in the previous sections indicate that the current icecube limits are not yet sufficient to distinguish between the dissipative photosheric models based on magnetic or baryonic dynamics , although they are approaching meaningful limits for baryonic internal shocks outside the photospheres .",
    "also , as of now it is not yet possible to set stringent limits on the value of @xmath216 , i.e. the putative ration of accelerated protons to accelerated electrons .",
    "one of the reasons , for the photospheric models , is that the magnetic reconnection or dissipation scenario is less straightforward than the simple internal shock scenario , having both more physical model uncertainties and parameters associated with them , e.g. the geometry of the plasma layers or the striped field structures , resistivity , instabilities , reconnection rate , etc .",
    "both for photospheric and internal shock models , the fraction of protons that are injected into the reconnection or fermi acceleration process is uncertain . the acceleration timescale and escape probability depend on the geometry and dynamics of magnetic reconnection or acceleration region .",
    "these factors are also crucial for determining the injection of a cosmic ray proton spectrum and its effect on the neutrino fluence , maximum neutrino energy and spectrum .    for these reasons , and in preparation for future improved limits from longer observation times and from possible future higher sensitivity detectors , we have here investigated the typical neutrino spectral features and flux levels expected from three of the basic grb models currently being considered .",
    "there are reasonable prospects that the detection or non - detection of these neutrino fluxes in the next decade with icecube or next generation of large neutrino detectors will shed light on the underlying physics of the grb jets and on the cosmic ray acceleration process in then ."
