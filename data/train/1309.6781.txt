    "despite decades of ever - intensifying research on supernovae ( sne ) , our understanding of their exact origins still remains incomplete .",
    "the connection between the observed properties of ccsne and the properties of their progenitors is one of the questions of interest - in particular the differences between the progenitors of different sn types ; whether the stellar mass is the dominant parameter or whether other factors such as binarity , rotation or metallicity of the progenitor also contribute significantly ( e.g. smartt 2009 ; smith et al .",
    "2011 ; eldridge et al .",
    "2013 and references therein ) .",
    "supernovae are classified into two main types : type i , with no hydrogen lines in their spectra ; and type ii , whose spectra show these lines ( e.g. filippenko 1997 )",
    ". sne of types ib , ic ( together referred to as type ibc ) and ii , i.e. core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) , are thought to have their origin in massive stars ( @xmath4 , @xcite ) that explode after exhausting their nuclear fuel .",
    "the progenitors of type ibc and iib sne are thought to be massive stars that have lost their outer envelopes ( h envelope for ib and both h and he for ic ) by stellar winds or through mass transfer to a binary companion ( see e.g. eldridge et al . 2013 ) .",
    "the progenitors of other type ii sne , on the other hand , are believed to be less massive supergiant stars that have retained their envelopes .",
    "however , the nature of type iin sn progenitors is unclear .",
    "at least part of them are believed to be extremely massive stars ( e.g. smith et al .",
    "2011 ) , but @xcite instead found evidence that , on average , type iin sne originate from the lower mass end of the ccsn progenitors .",
    "attempts to directly observe ccsn progenitors in pre - explosion archive images of host galaxies have yielded direct detections of several sn ii progenitors ( e.g. smartt et al .",
    "2004 ; li et al . 2006 ; mattila et al .",
    "2008 ; van dyk et al . 2011 ; maund et al .",
    "2011 ) , but the need to be able to resolve individual stars in other galaxies typically requires a space telescope or adaptive optics . another way to study the progenitors is to observe the environments of the sne",
    ". statistical analysis of galaxy light close to the locations of historical sne can yield constraints on the nature of their progenitors .",
    "h@xmath0 line emission is important in this context , since it traces regions of ionized hydrogen ; and only massive young stars ( that also give rise to ccsne ) contribute significantly to the ionizing radiation @xcite .",
    "@xcite found an excess of type ii sne in regions of low star - forming activity in contrast to sne of type ibc by studying a sample of 63 sne ( of which , however , 25 were either of type ia or had no designated type ) .",
    "this analysis was repeated for a total of 260 sne in @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter referred to as a08 and a12 , respectively ) with similar results .",
    "these results implied a mass sequence for ccsn progenitors running , in ascending order , from type ii through ib to ic .",
    "@xcite also argue for a higher mass for type ibc progenitors than type ii using colours of sn environments .",
    "in addition statistical studies of the radial distribution of ccsne have indicated that type ibc sne are more centrally concentrated than type ii sne ( e.g. petrosian et al . 2005 , prieto , stanek & beacom 2008 , anderson & james 2009 , hakobyan et al . 2009 ) .",
    "in particular , this also appeared to be the case for disturbed galaxies , with presumably higher star formation rates than in normal spiral galaxies ( habergham , anderson & james 2010 ; habergham , james & anderson ( 2012 ) .",
    "anderson , habergham & james ( 2011 ) studied a single interacting luminous infared galaxy ( lirg ; defined as a galaxy with @xmath5 ) system , arp 299 ( ngc 3690 and ic 694 ) , which has hosted 7 optically observed sne .",
    "they found evidence that its population of sne may be different from that of normal spiral galaxies  with an abnormal number of stripped - envelope sne abnormally close to the cores of the system  although the study has to deal with small - number statistics .",
    "one possible interpretation is that , because of the young age of the most recent starburst episode in the system , insufficient time has elapsed for the observed sn rates to reflect the star formation rates for the full range of stellar masses capable of producing ccsne @xmath6 .",
    "this lends support to type ibc and iib sne arising from progenitors of shorter lifetime than other type ii . on the other hand ,",
    "the centralisation of type ib / iib sne compared to other type ii in arp 299  and the central excess of type ibc sne found in other studies implies that in the central region with enhanced star formation , the initial mass function ( imf ) may favor high mass stars . according to @xcite ,",
    "the central excess found in normal spiral galaxies can alternatively be explained by higher metallicities of the progenitors of type ibc sne .",
    "habergham et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2012 ) studied the central excess of type ibc sne in disturbed galaxies , considering also metallicity as a possible explanation , but found this possibility unlikely .",
    "the studies of e.g. @xcite ( as well as a08 and a12 ) and @xcite mentioned above concern sne in spiral galaxy hosts in general . in light of the recent results of @xcite , we study ccsne in infrared ( ir ) -bright galaxies in a similar way in this paper . our goal is to find out whether the supernova and thus progenitor star population in these galaxies really differs from normal spiral galaxies .",
    "we apply the methods used by @xcite ( and in subsequent papers ) , extending them to the _ r_- and _ ks_-bands and to the near - uv .",
    "we also apply the method of @xcite .",
    "the results are then compared to the earlier studies .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : in section 2 we describe our sample and observations ; section 3 presents our data reduction methods ; sections 4 and 5 cover the statistical tools at our disposal and an overview of our results based on each method , respectively ; in section 6 , we discuss our results ; and finally , in section 7 , we present our conclusions .",
    "a sample of ir - bright galaxies was selected from among those in the iras revised bright galaxy catalog @xcite based on their far - ir luminosities ( @xmath7 , in the wavelength range of 40  400 @xmath8 m ) and distance following the criteria below .",
    "far - infrared luminosity was used as a criterion since it is a good tracer of star formation in actively star - forming galaxies .",
    "luminosities and distances were taken from @xcite .",
    "the value for the hubble constant used in this catalog was 75 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 .",
    "+   + ( 1 ) @xmath10 mpc , + ( 2 ) @xmath11 ( log @xmath12 ) .",
    "+ ( 3 ) type 1 seyfert galaxies listed in @xcite were excluded to avoid contamination by an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "+ ( 4 ) observable from la palma with a reasonable airmass , i.e. decl . @xmath13 .",
    "+ @xcite argue that after @xmath14 km s@xmath9 one will begin to miss sne with low projected distance from the galaxy core . with our distance limit , this value is not exceeded by any host galaxy .",
    "the limit in @xmath7 is roughly half of that of the ` prototypical ' starburst galaxy , m 82 , in order to include a larger number of galaxies that still have high star formation rates ( sfrs ) .",
    "it corresponds to a star formation rate of @xmath15 yr@xmath9 according to eq . 4 in @xcite and a ccsn rate of @xmath16 yr@xmath9 according to eq . 1 in @xcite",
    "the median distance in the sample is @xmath17 mpc and the median @xmath7 is 3.7 @xmath18 . a comparison between our galaxy sample and that of a08/a12 is presented in fig . 1 ,",
    "to show the different distance and luminosity ranges covered .",
    "the majority of the a08/a12 sample is well below our luminosity limit .",
    "any sne discovered before 1990 were excluded from the sample .",
    "these sne mostly had no ( sub)type classification , and their exact coordinates were considered possibly inaccurate because they were often discovered using photographic plates .",
    "the coordinates of the sne were obtained from the asiago supernova catalog .",
    "all sne of type ia were also excluded , since they arise from a much older stellar population than ccsne and are thus outside the scope of this paper .",
    "this resulted in a total sample of 57 galaxies  22 of which are brighter in the fir than m82 , the prototypical starburst galaxy , and ten of which are lirgs .",
    "the galaxy sample was sorted into three classes by eye , based on the presence or lack of tidal features or companion galaxies within a few arcminutes : isolated ( 28 galaxies ) , `` disturbed '' ( 19 galaxies ) and merger / close pair ( 10 galaxies ) .",
    "the sn sample consists of 86 sne , of which 35 were of type ib , ic or iib ( _ stripped - envelope sne ( se - sne ) _ ) ; 47 were of other type ii ( ii - p , ii - l , iin and those only classified ` ii ' ) ; and four were of undetermined type . for a complete list of ccsn host galaxies included in the study , see table 1 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    ") values and corresponding values in a08 and a12 for those sne also included in their study .",
    "there is no systematic difference between the two sets of values.,width=313 ]      comparing our ncr(h@xmath0 ) values and those of a08 and a12 ( this includes 46 sne in total ; see fig . 5 for comparison ) , we see no systematic difference between the two sets .",
    "most of the outlying values seem to be caused by an error in the astrometric calibration of either image .",
    "the ncr values for these sne are 0.281 ( 0.023 from a08/a12 ) for sn 1997bs , 0.581 ( 0.897 ) for sn 1999gn , 0.925 ( 0 ) for sn 2000cr , 0.479 ( 0.096 ) for sn 2008ij and 0.776 ( 0.398 ) for sn 2009hd .",
    "we determined ncr values for the pixels surrounding the sn positions up to a radius of 1@xmath19 , and values roughly agreeing with those in a08 and a12 were found among these pixels , suggesting a possibility of small positional errors . for sn 2000cr in particular , the ncr difference is very large , but it is located in a compact bright region . in addition , sn 2005v s value in a08 is given as 0.000",
    ". however , @xcite originally gave it an ncr(h@xmath0 ) of 0.861 , which is consistent with our value , and we have used this for fig .",
    "5 . the mean ncr(h@xmath0 ) of these 46 overlapping sne is 0.391 @xmath3 0.046 from our values and 0.367 @xmath3 0.044 from a08/a12 ; after removing the sne with possible astrometric error , the mean values become 0.372 @xmath3 0.047 and 0.383 @xmath3 0.046 respectively .",
    "therefore we can conclude that there is no systematic difference between the two studies .",
    "@xcite explored some possible biases that might be affecting their sample .",
    "firstly , because of the lower peak luminosity of type ii than type ibc sne , the former may be more difficult to detect in distant galaxies .",
    "additionally , sne of all types might be more difficult to detect against bright regions ( especially the central regions ) of host galaxies as the distance increases .",
    "the former effect could manifest itself as a decreasing ratio of type ii versus type ibc sne with increasing host galaxy distance and the latter as a decreasing mean ncr value .",
    "@xcite did detect a trend of decreasing type ratio , but explained this as simply the result of their sample selection effects : their galaxies have been chosen to yield sne with subtype classifications , which are more unlikely to be determined for distant type ii sne because of the required systematic photometry .",
    "furthermore , they detected no decrease in mean ncr values with increasing distance for either type ibc or type ii , and concluded that there is no selection effect favoring the detection of one over the other against bright regions and that they are thus seeing intrinsic variations in correlation .",
    "our sample , however , has been chosen based on _ galaxy _ properties , paying no attention to sn types or subtypes .",
    "therefore it is also worth checking whether we see any trends with increasing distance .",
    "the mean ncr values from h@xmath0 and _ ks_-band images are plotted in fig .",
    "6 as a function of host galaxy distance . like @xcite",
    ", we detect no statistically significant decrease in ncr values with distance in either subsample or the full sample in h@xmath0 or the _ ks_-band .",
    "the values show some variation , but no obvious trends .",
    "therefore we agree with @xcite that there seems to be no selection effect favoring the detection of type ibc / iib sne over type ii _ against bright regions _ within our distance limit .",
    "in addition , the ratio of type ii sne versus ibc / iib does not significantly drop with increased distance : splitting the sample in half based on distance , we find a ratio of 1.6 @xmath3 0.5 for nearby and 1.3 @xmath3 0.4 for distant galaxies .",
    "the poissonian error bars of the ratios are quite large , and with a sample of this size this result is only tentative .            furthermore , we have compared the ratio of the main types in our sample to the volumetric sn rates inside a recession velocity limit of 2000 km s@xmath9 from the lick observatory supernova search ( loss ) @xcite , and to the relative numbers of sne within the same limit , discovered betwen 1998 and 2012.25 and compiled by @xcite .",
    "the ratio of type ii vs. types ibc / iib in our sample is @xmath20 , while from the volume - limited loss rates we find a ratio of 1.7 @xmath3 0.4 and from @xcite 1.6 @xmath3 0.3 .",
    "based on this , we do not seem to have missed a significant number of type ii sne _ compared to types ibc / iib_.    there are significant amounts of dust in the centres of ir - bright galaxies , which can cause up to 80 per cent of sne to be missed in the nuclear regions of lirgs ( e.g. mattila et al .",
    "2012 ; miluzio et al .",
    "2013 ) . as can be inferred from fig .",
    "3 , the _ ks_-band",
    "_ fr _ values show a general central deficit compared to the optical bands .",
    "this deficit is dominated by merger and galaxy pair systems , where our sample only includes one sn with _ fr_(_ks _ ) @xmath21 0.23 ( 19 sne in total in these galaxies ) .",
    "the indication is that most of the central sne are missed due to extinction effects for the optical sn searches , but the central _",
    "ks_-band light is not due to the reduced extinction in this band . by eye ,",
    "the cdf is smoothed out by adding roughly twelve sne in the _ fr_(_ks _ )",
    "range 0  0.25 in the merger sample , resulting in a missed central sn fraction of roughly 90 per cent , which is consistent with the estimates presented by @xcite . in the _ r_-band",
    "there is no such deficit , because the central emission suffers from similar extinction as the central sne .",
    "if all the sne were to be detected , the cdf in _ ks_-band would resemble the one in _",
    "r_-band  now we see the _ ks_-band emission but have not detected the sne .",
    "this effect concerns all types of sne equally , and thus any bias to our analysis should be insignificant .",
    "type ibc / iib sne occur significantly closer to regions of recent star formation than type ii sne .",
    "the average ncr(h@xmath0 ) value for ibc / iib is 0.475 @xmath3 0.052 , which indicates they closely follow the distribution of h@xmath0 light . comparing the distribution of type ibc / iib sne and a flat distribution of ncr values with the k - s test confirms this association .",
    "type ii sne , on the other hand , do not follow the star - forming regions .",
    "a k - s test between the two main types indicates that they arise from different stellar populations .",
    "earlier studies ( e.g. a08 , a12 ) explain this with type ibc sne having more massive progenitors which thus have shorter lifetimes and therefore have less time to drift away from their birthplaces , or the h ii region has less time to dissipate , leading to a closer association with star - forming regions .",
    "in addition , as more sne occur in an h ii region , it will gradually cease to exist due to loss of stars emitting ionizing radiation and strong stellar winds and the sn explosions blowing away the gas .",
    "therefore the first sne would show a stronger association with the region ( as discussed by a12 ) .",
    "when we examine the subtypes ib and ic separately , we find that the ncr(h@xmath0 ) values of our type ib sne are consistent with those of type ii , while those of type ic are confirmed to be significantly higher  too high , in fact , to be randomly drawn from the h@xmath0 emission ; they are strongly correlated with the h ii regions .",
    "the difference between types ib and ii is rather small in a12 as well  in fact , the error limits of their mean ncrs overlap slightly .",
    "this indicates an overlapping mass range for the progenitors of types ib and ii , or at least that they both are outside the lifetime range traced by h@xmath0 emission .",
    "a caveat was recently discussed by @xcite .",
    "he argued that since individual small h ii regions would dissipate in a time scale shorter than the ages of the progenitors of type ibc / iib or ii sne , no meaningful constraints could be obtained for stars less massive than 50 ",
    "100 @xmath22 ; in addition , small h ii regions would not be detected in the ground - based images used for this study .",
    "on the other hand , giant h ii regions would last on the order of 20 myr , meaning that one can only make weak constraints based on association with h@xmath0 emission ; namely , limits of @xmath23 for se - sn progenitors and @xmath24 for type ii , based on what is considered the smallest possible mass for a sn progenitor . the differences in correlation with h@xmath0 light that are seen in both our study and those in @xcite and later papers",
    "do indicate that type ic progenitors are more massive than the @xmath25 limit while some ib and ii progenitors could be less massive .",
    "one way to address this problem is to also use uv light as an indicator of _ recent _  on timescales of 16 to 100 myr @xcite  as opposed to _ on - going _ , star formation .",
    "this was done for type ii - p and iin sne and ` impostors ' in a12 . based on our results",
    ", we find that type ii sne accurately trace the galaxy nuv light with a mean ncr(nuv ) close to 0.5 .",
    "we obtained a mean ncr(nuv ) close to 0.5 ( consistent with type ii ) for type ib and a significantly higher one ( confirmed by the k - s test against a flat distribution ) for ic . thus type ic sne preferably occur in regions with high nuv intensity .",
    "this lends additional support to type ic progenitors being of higher mass than those of types ib and ii . since the difference between types ib and",
    "ii in both h@xmath0 and nuv is insignificant and they both are consistent with being randomly drawn from the nuv light distribution , this indicates that their progenitor lifetimes are @xmath26 16 myr as traced by the nuv @xcite .",
    "lower - mass interacting binaries , instead of massive wolf - rayet stars , have been proposed to be the progenitors of a significant fraction of type ibc sne ( e.g. podsiadlowski , joss & hsu 1992 ; smartt 2009 ) and of type iib sne @xcite  which is also supported by a lack of direct detections of their progenitors @xcite . @xcite and @xcite suggested that type ib and iib sne arise mostly from interacting binaries and type ic sne at least partly from more massive single wr stars .",
    "this could explain our results .",
    "our _ r_-band results are very similar to nuv .",
    "the k - s test shows a significant difference between the sne of types ibc / iib  and specifically ic  and a flat distribution of ncr(_r _ ) values .",
    "the calculated mean values for types ii and ib are close to 0.5 , while ic sne are concentrated into the bright areas .",
    "it is likely , however , that _",
    "r_-band light does not provide a useful indicator on sn environments , since it includes both the h@xmath0 line emission and a stellar continuum from different sources .",
    "_ ks_-band light is thought to be a good tracer of stellar mass i.e. old stars @xcite since , in normal galaxies , most of the mass is in older stars .",
    "however , the contribution of red supergiants to the _ ks_-band light , which also exists in normal spiral galaxies @xcite , dominates this band in starburst galaxies @xcite , which would make _ ks_-band light a useful indicator of recent star formation similar to h@xmath0 . in the _",
    "ks_-band our results are indeed similar to those in h@xmath0 : the mean ncr for type ic is significantly larger than for type ii , while types ib and ii are consistent with each other .",
    "the k - s test confirms this . additionally there is a significant difference from a flat distribution for type ii , but not for other types .",
    "furthermore , _",
    "ks_-band emission is much less affected by extinction than h@xmath0 , which we can see in the difference between _ fr _ values ; smaller _ fr _ values could be expected in h@xmath0 than in _",
    "ks_-band because of the central h@xmath0 flux being strongly absorbed by the dust .",
    "extinction could have an effect on ncr values as well .",
    "however , this similarity in ncr values suggests that the lack of extinction correction makes no great difference here , assuming that _ ks_-band light does trace the birthplaces of massive stars in actively star - forming galaxies .    as for the radial ( _ fr _ ) distributions of the ccsne , the k - s test finds no statistically significant excess of type ibc / iib sne in the inner regions of galaxies compared to the host galaxy emission in the optical bands , which can also be seen in fig .",
    "fr_(h@xmath0 ) values are consistent with those of the sne in @xcite within the errors for all types , however . in the _ ks_-band",
    "we see a difference between type ii and a flat distribution , but no difference between types ibc / iib and a flat distribution .",
    "however , the radial distribution of optically - detected sne is not `` supposed '' to be flat in this band ( see sect .",
    "6.1 ) , and thus the difference between type ii sne and a flat distribution does not necessarily indicate an outer excess of type ii sne .    however , the mean normalised radial distances and the scale length of the sn surface density are significantly shorter for types ibc / iib than for type ii .",
    "these results indicate that sne of type ibc / iib are indeed more concentrated to the central regions of galaxies than those of type ii , which is in agreement with previous results by e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the radial distances for types ib and ic are equal within the errors , meaning that here we do see a difference between types ib and ii .",
    "the different results from these two tests may be explained by the fact that they measure different things .",
    "the normalised radial distances are not affected by the properties of the central regions , while _ fr _ values are .",
    "the clearest difference we see in the distributions of ccsne in normal vs. ir - bright galaxies is in the scale length of their surface density .",
    "based on a monte carlo analysis , we find a normalised scale length of @xmath27 , which is statistically significantly smaller than that derived by @xcite for a sample of ccsne in spiral galaxies ( 0.29 @xmath3 0.01 ) . however , there are roughly five `` extra '' ibc sne in the central regions compared to what one would expect from an exponential surface density profile derived by ignoring the innermost radial distance bin .",
    "since by ignoring the central bin we obtained a similar scale length ( @xmath28 ) for types ibc / iib as @xcite did for their type ibc sample ( @xmath29 ) , and since the type ii scale lengths match within the errors ( we get @xmath30 and @xcite report 0.31 @xmath3 0.02 ) , the indication is that our shorter overall scale length is mainly due to an excess of types ibc / iib in the central regions , with respect not only to type ii but also to types ibc / iib in normal galaxies .",
    "prior radial analysis papers , and our corresponding results , indicate more central positions for sne of type ibc / iib than for other type ii . a metallicity gradient is often brought up as an explanation ( e.g. anderson & james 2009 ; hakobyan et al .",
    "2009 ) , since metallicity is known to be a major factor in the mass - loss rates of the progenitor stars ( e.g. crowther et al . 2002 ) .",
    "`` disturbed '' galaxies , especially merger systems , have a less pronounced metallicity gradient than normal isolated galaxies ( e.g. rich et al .",
    "2012 ) . dividing the galaxy sample into isolated , disturbed and merging / closely - paired systems",
    "( see sect .",
    "2 ) , we see that type ibc sne are more centrally located in `` disturbed '' galaxies . the mean @xmath31 for types",
    "ibc / iib is 0.588 @xmath3 0.138 in isolated galaxies , 0.315 @xmath3 0.085 in `` disturbed '' ones and 0.227 @xmath3 0.050 in merging / close - pair systems .",
    "thus type ibc / iib sne in mergers and `` disturbed '' galaxies are significantly more centralized .",
    "this is consistent with what is seen by @xcite , but it is the opposite of what one would expect if metallicity was the deciding factor , since the central metallicity in `` disturbed '' galaxies is expected to be _ lower _ than in isolated galaxies . @xcite also show that the metallicity gradient gets less pronounced with increased ir luminosity .",
    "however , we divided our sample into ( relatively ) ir - luminous and ir - faint galaxies , the threshold being the median log @xmath7 of our sample ( 10.57 ) with 44 sne in the brighter half and 42 in the fainter half .",
    "we find that the radial distances for type ibc / iib sne are the same , within the errors , regardless of which subsample the host galaxy belongs to ( mean @xmath31 = 0.359 @xmath3 0.089 in the fainter galaxies and 0.344 @xmath3 0.072 in the brighter ones ) .",
    "thus we see no evidence of a metallicity effect driving the relative centralization of type ibc / iib sne .    in the study of @xcite",
    "the centralization is taken to indicate that in the central regions of `` disturbed '' galaxies , the imf is top - heavy .",
    "klessen , spaans & jappsen ( 2007 ) presented a model , based on numerical simulations , where the increased temperature in intensely star - forming regions causes the local jeans mass to increase , which would in turn result in a top - heavy imf with a peak around 15 @xmath22 .",
    "obviously this would affect strongly star - forming galaxies more than normal spirals .",
    "however , we are seeing both ib and ic sne in the central regions ( four of type ib and five of type ic inside 0.2 @xmath2 ; see also table 7 ) . according to our ncr results , the mass ranges of the progenitors of type ii and",
    "ib sne seem to overlap strongly .",
    "thus , while the enhanced fraction of type ic sne can be explained by a modified imf in the central regions , that of type ib sne seemingly can not .",
    "thus our results suggest that while the top - heavy imf may play a role , it is not the only factor behind the enhanced se fraction in the central regions .    since we see no evidence of a metallicity dependence in the centralization , and since relatively low - mass binaries probably form a significant fraction of type ib(c ) progenitors ( see section 6.2 ) , we suggest that an enhanced close binary fraction in areas of high star formation density could be a significant factor , perhaps along with the top - heavy imf to account for the prevalence of both ib and ic sne .",
    "@xcite showed that in young star - forming regions in the milky way , the fraction of binary systems as a whole is either very weakly decreased or not at all compared to the field , while the fraction of _ close _ binaries is significantly enhanced .",
    "furthermore , a large fraction of star formation happens in young massive star clusters @xcite , which have been shown by @xcite to correlate with x - ray binaries .",
    "our sample galaxies tend to have strong central star formation , meaning that this would also apply to the central regions . in such dense regions found inside clusters , primordial hard binaries ( those with high binding energy )",
    "tend to harden and soft ones tend to soften according to heggie s law @xcite .",
    "while some of these binaries do get disrupted , this probably will not happen until many of them have exploded as sne .",
    "the relative numbers of sne of different types might also offer an indicator of differences between ir - bright and normal galaxies . as already stated in section 6.1 , the ratio of the numbers in our main subsamples ( ii vs. ibc / iib ) should be @xmath32 ( or 1.7 @xmath3 0.4 ) , based on the volume - limited numbers of different types of sne inside the recession velocity limit of 2000 km s@xmath9 , according to @xcite ( or @xcite ) . in our sample",
    "the observed ratio is @xmath20 , and thus in agreement with the volume - limited samples .",
    "if the central `` extra sne '' mentioned above are excluded , our type ratio would be @xmath33 .",
    "this indicates the rate of type ibc / iib sne compared to type ii in ir - bright galaxies is not significantly different than in normal galaxies .",
    "the suggested excess of type ibc / iib sne in the central regions _ compared to normal galaxies _ is thus not strong enough to affect the relative rates significantly .",
    "we have presented results for correlations between ccsne of different types and light in the h@xmath0 , _",
    "r_-band , _ ks_-band and nuv in ir - bright galaxies .",
    "we have also presented an analysis of radial positions of these sne in relation to the host galaxy light , and fitted functions to describe the sn surface densities .",
    "we have , when possible , compared these results with earlier studies , with samples dominated by normal spiral galaxies .",
    "our results confirm that type ic sne show a higher correlation with h@xmath0 light ( and thus on - going star formation ) than types ii or ib . in the nuv ( recent star formation )",
    "types ii and ib accurately trace the host galaxy light , while ic sne are concentrated in the bright regions . assuming that a higher correlation with h@xmath0 light is because of a shorter lifetime of the progenitor star and thus a higher mass , the average masses of type ic progenitors are indicated to be higher than those of types ib and ii , as asserted previously by e.g. a08 and a12 .",
    "however , both type ib and ii are consistent with being randomly drawn from the nuv light distribution but not from the h@xmath0 distribution ; thus the mass difference between these progenitors may not be significant , and instead binarity may play a larger role .    in the _",
    "ks_-band the pixel statistics results are quite similar ; type ibc / iib sne are more strongly correlated with the underlying galaxy light . since the _",
    "ks_-band light of actively star - forming galaxies is dominated by red supergiants , it is also a tracer of recent star formation in these galaxies .",
    "therefore we can infer the same results as from the h@xmath0 and nuv data , further supported by the weaker extinction in the infrared .",
    "type ibc / iib sne are preferentially more centrally located in their host galaxies than type ii in our sample , which is consistent with previous results by @xcite .",
    "this is probably due to the effect of an enhanced close binary fraction and/or a top - heavy imf in the central regions compared to the outer regions ( however , the imf _ alone _ seems inadequate to explain our results ) .",
    "we see no evidence of metallicity playing a major role here .",
    "a significant fraction of sne may be missed in the centres of ir - bright galaxies due to high line - of - sight extinctions and contrast effects , which we see clearly when comparing the ccsn distribution with that of host galaxy _",
    "ks_-band light , but we do not find any evidence that type ii sne would be more strongly affected by this than type ibc / iib in our sample .",
    "the scale length of the ccsn surface density is significantly smaller in ir - bright galaxies than in samples dominated by normal spiral galaxies .",
    "furthermore , this seems to be caused mainly by an excess of type ibc / iib sne in the central regions , compared not only to type ii but to normal spiral galaxies as well : by ignoring the central sne the scale lengths for both main types ( ibc / iib and ii ) match those derived by @xcite .",
    "the top - heavy imf and/or enhanced close binary fraction thus especially apply to ir - bright galaxies , many of which are `` disturbed '' .",
    "if dust extinction in these galaxies is greater than normal and more ( central ) sne are missed , this effect is even stronger than what is seen here .",
