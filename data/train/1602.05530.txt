    "many stochastic processes , natural or man - made , are explicitly path - dependent .",
    "famous examples include biological evolution @xcite or technological innovation @xcite .",
    "formally , path - dependence means that the probabilities to reach certain states of the system ( or the transition rates from one state to another ) at a given time depend on the history of the process up to this time . this statistical time - dependence can induce dramatic deformations of phase - space , in the sense that certain regions will hardly be revisited again , while others will be visited much more frequently .",
    "this makes a large number of path - dependent complex systems , and processes that are associated with them , non - ergodic .",
    "they are typically mathematically intractable with a few famous exceptions , including the pitman - yor or ` chinese restaurant ' process @xcite , recurrent random sequences proposed by s. ulam and m. kac @xcite , plya urns @xcite , and the recently introduced sample space reducing processes ( ssrps ) @xcite .",
    "ssrps are processes that reduce their sample space as they progress over time . in their simplest form",
    "they can be depicted by the following process .",
    "imagine a staircase like the one shown in figure [ fig1]a .",
    "each state @xmath1 of the system corresponds to one particular stair .",
    "a ball is initially ( @xmath2 ) placed at the topmost stair @xmath3 , and can jump randomly to any of the @xmath4 lower stairs in the next timestep with a probability @xmath5 .",
    "assume that at time @xmath6 the ball landed at stair @xmath1 .",
    "since it can only jump to stairs @xmath7 that are below @xmath1 , the probability to jump to stair @xmath8 is @xmath9 .",
    "the process continues until eventually stair @xmath10 is reached ; it then halts .",
    "remarkably , the statistics over a large number of repetitions of ssrps yields an exact zipf s law in the rank - frequency distribution of the visits of states @xcite , a fact that links path - dependence with scaling phenomena in an intuitive way .",
    "ssrps add an alternative and independent route to understand the origin of scaling ( zipf s law in particular ) to the well known classical ways @xcite , criticality @xcite , self - organised criticality @xcite , multiplicative processes with constraints @xcite , and preferential attachment models @xcite . beyond their transparent mathematical tractability ,",
    "ssrps seem to have a wide applicability , including diffusion on complete directed acyclical graphs @xcite , quantitative linguistics @xcite , record statistics @xcite , and fragmentation processes @xcite .",
    "ssrps can be seen as very specific non - standard sampling processes , with a directional bias or a symmetry breaking mechanism . in the same pictorial view as above a standard sampling processes",
    "can be depicted as a ball bouncing randomly left and right ( without a directional bias as in the ssrp ) over a set of states , see figure [ fig1]b . the ball samples the states with a uniform prior probability , meaning that all states are sampled with equal probability . a situation with non - uniform priors",
    "is shown in figure [ fig1]c where the different widths of boxes represent the probability to hit a particular state . in a standard sampling process",
    "exactly this non - uniform prior distribution will be recovered .",
    "so far , ssrps have been studied for the simplest case only , where the potential outcomes or states are sampled from an underlying uniform prior distribution @xcite . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that a much wider class of ssrps leads to exact scaling laws .",
    "in particular we will show that ssrps lead to zipf s law irrespective of the underlying prior distributions .",
    "this is schematically shown in figure [ fig1]d , where the prior distribution is non - uniform , and states are sampled with a ssrp .",
    "the resulting distribution function will no longer follow the prior distribution as in figure [ fig1]c , but produces zipf s law .",
    "we provide show in detail how ssrps depend on their prior distributions .",
    "zipf s law turns out to be an attractor distribution that holds for practically any ssrp , irrespective of the details of the stochastic system at hand , i.e. irrespective of their prior distributions .",
    "this extreme robustness with respect to details of transition rates between states within a system offers a simple understanding of the ubiquity of zipf s law .",
    "phenomena that show a high robustness of zipf s law with respect to changes on the detailed properties of the system have been reported before @xcite .    as an important example we demonstrate these mathematical facts in the context of diffusion processes on",
    "_ directed acyclic graphs _ ( dag ) .",
    "here zipf s distributions of node visiting frequencies appear generically , regardless of the weight- or degree distribution of the network .",
    "we call diffusion processes on dag structures _ targeted diffusion _ , since , in this type network , diffusion is targeted towards a set of target or sink nodes , see figure [ fig1]e .",
    "the targeted diffusion results we present here are in line with recent findings reported in @xcite .",
    "we start the formal study of the statistics of ssrps for the noiseless case which implies  in the staircase picture  that upward jumps are not allowed ( sampling with a bias ) .",
    "we then study how the statistics of ssrps behaves when noise is introduced . in this case",
    "the probability of upward jumps is no longer zero .",
    "think of the @xmath3 possible states of a given system as stairs with different widths and imagine a ball bouncing downstairs with random step sizes .",
    "the probability of the downward bouncing ball to hit stair @xmath1 is proportional to its width @xmath11 , see figure [ fig1]d . given these prior probabilities @xmath11 , the transition probability from stair @xmath12 to stair @xmath1 is @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "prior probabilities are normalised , @xmath15 .",
    "we denote such a ssrp by @xmath16 .",
    "one can safely assume the existence of a stationary visiting distribution , @xmath17 , arising from many repetitions of process @xmath16 and satisfying the following relation : @xmath18 using equation ( [ eq : p(a_k|a_i ) ] ) , and forming the difference @xmath19 and by re - arranging terms we find that @xmath20 where we use the fact that @xmath21 .",

    ". equation ( [ eq : solutionno_noise ] ) shows that the path - dependence of the ssrp @xmath16 _ deforms _ the prior probabilities of the states of a given system , @xmath26 .",
    "we can now discuss various concrete prior distributions .",
    "note that equation ( [ eq : solutionno_noise ] ) is exact and does not dependent on system size .",
    "+    _ polynomial priors and the ubiquity of zipf s law : _ given power law priors , @xmath27 with @xmath28 , one can compute @xmath29 up to a normalisation constant @xmath30 which , when used in equation ( [ eq : solutionno_noise ] ) , asymptotically gives @xmath31 i.e. , zipf s law . more generally , this result is true for polynomial priors , @xmath32 , where the degree of the polynomial @xmath33 is larger than @xmath0 , in the limit of large systems .",
    "numerical simulations show perfect agreement with the theoretical prediction for various values of @xmath34 , see figure [ fig : numerics]a ( circles , triangles , red squares ) .",

    "can be approximated for sufficiently large @xmath1 s , as @xmath37 .",
    "we encounter the remarkable situation that for fast decaying priors the ssrp , even though it is history dependent , follows the prior distribution . in this case",
    "the ssrp resembles a standard sampling process .",
    "+ _ exponential priors : _ for exponential priors , @xmath38 , with @xmath39 , we find according to equation ( [ eq : solutionno_noise ] ) that @xmath40 , i.e. , a uniform distribution . to see this note that , up to a normalisation constant , @xmath41 is a geometric series , @xmath42 substituting it into equation ( [ eq : solutionno_noise ] ) , one finds the exact relation @xmath43 which can be safely approximated , for @xmath44 , by @xmath45 we observe that this is a constant independent of @xmath1",
    "accordingly , after normalisation , we will have @xmath46 .",
    "note that exponential priors describe a somewhat pathological situation .",
    "given that a state @xmath1 is occupied at time @xmath47 , the probability to visit state @xmath48 is huge compared to all the other remaining states , so that practically all states will be sampled in a descending sequence : @xmath49 , which obviously leads to a uniform @xmath17 .",
    "again , numerical simulations show perfect agreement with the prediction , as shown in figure [ fig : numerics]a ( grey squares ) . switching from polynomial to exponential priors , we switch the attractor from the zipf s regime to the uniform distribution .",

    "the _ noisy _ variant of the ssrp , denoted by @xmath50 , starts at @xmath3 and jumps to any stair @xmath51 , according to the prior probabilities @xmath11 . at @xmath1",

    "@xmath54 is the noise strength .",
    "the process stops when stair @xmath10 is hit .",
    "the transition probabilities for @xmath50 read , @xmath56 note that the noise allows moves from @xmath12 to @xmath1 , even if @xmath57 . proceeding exactly as before we get @xmath58 where @xmath59 depicts the probability to visit state @xmath1 in a noisy ssrp with parameter @xmath52 . as a consequence",

    ", we recover the case of standard random sampling , @xmath71 .",
    "it is worth noting that continuous ssrp display the same scaling behaviour ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the particular case of @xmath72 that was studied in @xcite , shows that @xmath52 turns out to be the scaling exponent of the distribution @xmath73 .",

    "[ tab ] . clearly , the presence of noise recovers the prior probabilities in a fuzzy way , depending on the noise levels .",

    ".distribution functions @xmath25 of ssrps for the various prior distributions @xmath11 .",
    "ssrp distributions with a noise level of @xmath79 are indicated by @xmath59 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab ]",
    "the above results have immediate and remarkable consequences for the diffusion on dags @xcite or , more generally , on networks with target- , sink- or absorbing nodes .",
    "we call this process _ targeted diffusion_. in particular , the results derived above allow us to understand the origin of zipf s law of node visiting times for practically all weighted dags , regardless of their degree- and weight distributions .",
    "we first demonstrate this fact with simulation experiments on weighted dags and then , in section [ sec : analyticsrandomdag ] we analytically derive the corresponding equations of targeted diffusion for the large class of sparse random dags , that explain that zipf s law must occur in node visiting frequencies . in appendix b proofs",
    "are given for the cases of exponential and scale free networks .",
    "we start with the observation that ssrps with uniform priors can be seen as a diffusion processes on a fully connected dag , where nodes correspond one - to - one to the stairs of the above examples .",
    "this results in a zipf s law of node visiting frequencies @xcite .",
    "however , such fully connected networks are extremely unlikely to occur in reality .",
    "to create much more realistic structures , we generate arbitrary random dags following e.g. references @xcite .",
    "start with any undirected connected graph @xmath80 , with @xmath81 the set of nodes , @xmath82 the set of edges , and @xmath83 the degree distribution , see figure [ fig : dags]a .",
    "next , label each node in any desired way that allows an ordering , for example with numbers @xmath84 , see figure [ fig : dags]b .",
    "the labelling induces an order that determines the directionality of links in the graph : if nodes @xmath1 and @xmath12 are connected , we draw an arrow from @xmath1 to @xmath12 , if @xmath57 , or from @xmath12 to @xmath1 , if @xmath85 , as seen in figure [ fig : dags]c .",
    "we denote the resulting dag by @xmath86 .",
    "the order induced by the labelling mimics the order ( or symmetry breaking ) that underlies any ssrps . by definition ,",
    "there exists , at least , one target node , `` @xmath10 '' .",
    "noise can be introduced to this dag construction as follows : if node @xmath1 and @xmath12 are connected in @xmath87 and @xmath57 one can assign an arrow from @xmath1 to @xmath12 ( as before ) with probability @xmath52 , or place the arrow in a random direction with probability @xmath54 .",
    "this will create cycles that play the role of _ noise _ in the targeted diffusion process .",
    "this network is no longer a pure dag since it contains cycles .      a diffusion process on @xmath88 is now carried out by placing random walkers on the nodes randomly , and letting them take steps following the arrows in the network .",
    "they diffuse according to the weights in the network until they hit a target node and are then removed .",
    "we record the number of visits to all nodes and sort them according to the number of visits , obtaining a _ rank distribution _ of visits .",
    "we show the results from numerical experiments of @xmath89 random walkers on various dags in figure [ fig3 ] . in figs .",
    "[ fig3]a and [ fig3]b we plot the rank distribution of visits to nodes for weighted erds - rnyi ( er ) dag networks .",
    "a weight @xmath90 is randomly assigned to each link @xmath91 from a given weight distribution @xmath92 .",
    "weights either follow a poisson distribution , figure [ fig3]a , or a power - law distribution , figure [ fig3]b . in both cases",
    "zipf s law is obtained in the rank distribution of node visits . for the same network",
    "we introduce _ noise _ with @xmath93 and carry out the same diffusion experiment .",
    "the observed slope corresponds nicely with the predicted value of @xmath52 , as shown in figure [ fig3]a ( red squares ) for the poisson weights .",
    "we computed rank distributions of node visits from diffusion on more general network topologies . in figure",
    "[ fig3]c we show the rank distribution of node visits where the substrate network is the citation network of high energy physics in the arxiv repository @xcite , and the order is induced by the degree of nodes . figure [ fig3]d shows the rank distribution of node visits from diffusion on an exponential dag , that is generated by non - preferential attachment @xcite , where the order of nodes is again induced according to the degree .",
    "both networks show zipf s law in the rank distribution of node visits .",
    "this is remarkable since both networks are drastically different in topological terms .      for diffusion on random dags",
    "it is possible to obtain analytic results that are identical to equation ( [ eq : p(a_k|a_i ) ] ) , showing that zipf s law is generally present in targeted diffusion .",
    "we first focus on the definition of the prior probabilities in the context of diffusion on undirected networks .",
    "as stated above , @xmath11 is the probability that state @xmath1 is visited in a random sampling process , see figs .",
    "1b and 1c . in the network context",
    "this corresponds to the probability that node @xmath1 is visited by a random walker .",
    "assume that we have an undirected random graph @xmath94 and that the @xmath3 nodes are labelled @xmath95 .",
    "the probability that a random walker arrives at node @xmath1 from a randomly chosen link of @xmath82 , the _ network - prior _ probability of node @xmath1 , is easily identified as @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the number of links in the graph ; the factor @xmath98 appears because a link contains @xmath98 endpoints .",
    "if @xmath99 denotes the undirected degree sequence @xmath100 , is a simple rescaling of @xmath101 , i.e. , @xmath102 .",
    "using the same notation as before , the cumulative _ network - prior _ probability distribution is @xmath103 .    from equation ( [ eq : priornets ] ) and by assuming that in sparse graphs the probability of self - loops vanishes , i.e. , @xmath104 , one can compute the probability that a link @xmath105 exists in @xmath87 , @xcite @xmath106 where the second step is possible since @xmath107 . with this result ,",
    "the _ out - degree _ of node labelled @xmath1 in the graph @xmath88 can be approximated by @xmath108 note that to compute @xmath109 we only need take into account the ( undirected ) links which connect @xmath1 to nodes with a lower label @xmath53 , according to the labelling used for the dag construction outlined above .",
    "we can now compute the probability that a random walker jumps from node @xmath1 to node @xmath12 on the dag @xmath88 , @xmath110 this is the network analogue of equation ( [ eq : p(a_k|a_i ) ] ) . here",
    "@xmath111 is the probability that the random walker jumps from @xmath1 to @xmath12 given that @xmath57 and the link @xmath105 exists in @xmath87 . clearly , this probability is @xmath112 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : p_eij ] ) and ( [ eq : kout2 ] ) in equation ( [ eq : p(k|i)general ] ) we get @xmath113 which has the same form as equation ( [ eq : p(a_k|a_i ) ] ) .",
    "note that this expression only depends on @xmath100 , i.e. the degrees of nodes in the _ undirected _ ( ! ) graph @xmath87 .",
    "the solution of equation ( [ eq : q - factorization ] ) is obtained in exactly the same way as before for equation ( [ eq : p(a_k|a_i ) ] ) , and the node visiting probability of targeted diffusion on random dags is @xmath114 which is the network analog of equation ( [ eq : solutionno_noise ] ) .",
    "we finally show the results for a dag that is based on an er graph . for an er graph , by definition ,",
    "the probability for a link to exist is a constant @xmath115 $ ] , and @xmath116 .",
    "again we label all nodes by @xmath84 and build a dag @xmath117 as described above .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the out - degree of node @xmath1 is @xmath118 , and , using this directly in equation ( [ eq : p(k|i)general ] ) , we get @xmath119 which is the standard equation for a ssrp with uniform prior probabilities @xmath120 , @xcite .",
    "this means that for the er graph @xmath121 is a constant and @xmath122 . using this in equation ( [ eq : general_net ] )",
    ", we find that the node visiting probability is exactly zipf s law , with respect to the ordering used to build the dag , @xmath123 note that this result is independent of @xmath124 and , therefore , of the average degree of the graph .",
    "we have shown that if a system , whose states are characterized by prior probabilities @xmath120 , is sampled through a ssrp , the corresponding sampling space gets deformed , in a way that zipf s law emerges as a dominant attractor .",
    "this is true for a huge class of reasonable prior probabilities , and might be the fundamental origin of the ubiquitous presence of zipf s law in nature . on the theoretical side we provide a direct link between non - ergodicity as it typically occurs in path - dependent processes and power laws in corresponding statistics .",
    "formally , ssrps define a microscopic dynamics that results in a deformation of the phase space .",
    "it has been pointed out that the emergence of non - extensive properties may be related to generic deformations of the phase space @xcite .",
    "consequently , ssrps offer a entirely new playground to connect microscopic and macroscopic dynamics in non - equilibrium systems .",
    "our results could help to understand the astonishing resilience of some scaling patterns which are associated with zipf s law , such as the recent universality in body - mass scaling found in ecosystems @xcite .",
    "we discussed one fascinating direct application of this process : the origin of scaling laws in node visit frequencies in targeted diffusion on networks .",
    "we demonstrated both theoretically and by simulations that the immense robustness of these scaling laws in targeted diffusion  and zipf s law in particular  arises generically , regardless of its topological details , or weight distributions .",
    "the corresponding exponents are related to the amount of cycles in a network .",
    "this finding should be relevant for a series of applications of targeted diffusion on networks where a target has to be found and reached , such as in traffic- , transport- or supply chain management .",
    "we conjecture that these findings and variations will apply for search processes in general .    _",
