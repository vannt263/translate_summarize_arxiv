    "to accommodate the exponential growth of data traffic over the last few years , the space - division multiplexing ( sdm ) based on multi - core optical fiber ( mcf ) or multi - mode optical fiber ( mmf ) is expected to overcome the barrier from capacity limit of single - core fiber @xcite .",
    "the main challenge in sdm occurs due to in - band crosstalk between multiple parallel transmission channels ( cores / modes ) .",
    "this non - negligible crosstalk can be dealt with using multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) signal processing techniques @xcite .",
    "those techniques are widely used for wireless communication systems and they helped to drastically increase channel capacity . assuming important crosstalk between cores and/or modes , negligible backscattering and near - lossless propagation , we can model the transmission optical channel as a random complex unitary matrix @xcite ..    in @xcite , authors appealed to the jacobi unitary ensemble ( jue ) to establish the propagation channel model for mimo communications over multi - mode / multi - core optical fibers .",
    "the jue is a matrix - variate analogue of the beta random variable and consists of complex hermitian random matrices which can be realized at least in two different ways @xcite .",
    "one of them mimics the construction of the beta random variable as a ratio of two independent gamma random variables : the latter are replaced by two independent complex hermitian wishart matrices whose sum is invertible .",
    "otherwise , one draws a haar - distributed unitary matrix then takes the square of the radial part of an upper left corner @xcite . by a known fact for unitarily invariant - random matrices @xcite",
    ", the average of any symmetric function with respect to the eigenvalues density can be expressed through the one - point correlation function , also known as the single - particle density . in particular , the ergodic capacity of a matrix drawn from the jue can be represented by an integral where the integrand involves the christoffel - darboux kernel associated with jacobi polynomials ( @xcite , p.384 ) .",
    "the drawback of this representation is the dependence of this kernel on the size of the matrix . indeed , its diagonal is written either as a sum of squares of jacobi polynomials and the number of terms in this sum equals the size of the matrix least one , or by means of the christoffel - darboux formula as a difference of the product of two jacobi polynomials whose degrees depend on the size of the matrix . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first study that derives exact expression of the ergodic capacity as a double integral over a suitable region .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a new expression for the ergodic capacity of the jacobi mimo channel relying this time on the formula derived in @xcite for the moments of the eigenvalues density of the jacobi random matrix .",
    "the obtained expression shows that the ergodic capacity is an average of some function over the signal - to - noise ratio , and it has the merit to have a simple dependence on the size of the matrix which allows for easier and more precise numerical simulations . by a limiting transition between jacobi and laguerre polynomials @xcite",
    ", we derive a similar expression for the ergodic capacity of the gaussian mimo channel @xcite .",

    "the function @xmath9 has an analytic continuation to the complex plane cut along the half - line @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , the jacobi polynomials @xmath16 of degree @xmath17 and parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 can also be expressed in terms of the gauss hypergeometric function as follows @xmath20 an important asymptotic property of the jacobi polynomial is that it can be reduced to the @xmath17-th laguerre polynomial of parameter @xmath21 through the following limit @xmath22    now , we come to the notations and the definitions related with random matrices , and refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "firstly , the hermitian transpose and the determinant of a complex matrix @xmath23 are denoted by @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "secondly , the laguerre unitary ensemble ( lue ) is formed out of non negative definite matrices @xmath26 where @xmath23 is a rectangular @xmath27 matrix , with @xmath28 , whose entries are complex independent gaussian random variables . a matrix from the lue is often referred to as a complex wishart matrix and @xmath29 are its degrees of freedom and its size respectively .",

    "assume @xmath34 , then @xmath35 is positive definite and @xmath36 belongs to the jue .",
    "the matrix @xmath37 is unitarily - invariant and satisfies @xmath38 where @xmath39 stand for the null and the identity matrices respectively and @xmath40 , we write @xmath41 when @xmath42 is a non negative matrix . ] .",
    "if @xmath43 then @xmath37 and @xmath44 are positive definite and the joint distribution of the ordered eigenvalues of @xmath37 has a density given by @xmath45 ^ 2 { \\bf 1}_{0 < \\lambda_1 < \\dots < \\lambda_n < 1 } \\label{eq : tmpconc}\\ ] ] with respect to lebesgue measure @xmath46 . here ,",
    "@xmath47 , @xmath48 is a normalization constant read off from the selberg integral @xcite : @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the vandermonde polynomial .",
    "another construction of matrices from the jue is as follows @xcite : let @xmath51 be an @xmath52 haar - distributed unitary matrix .",

    "we consider an optical space - division multiplexing where the multiple channels correspond to the number of excited modes / cores within the optical fiber .",
    "the coupling between different modes and/or cores can be described by scattering matrix formalism @xcite . in this paper , we consider @xmath63-channel lossless optical fiber with @xmath64 transmitting excited channels and @xmath65 receiving channels .",
    "the scattering matrix formalism can describe very simply the propagation through the fiber using @xmath66 scattering matrix @xmath67 given as @xmath68 where the @xmath52 block matrices @xmath69 and @xmath70 describe the reflection from left to left and from right to right of the fiber , respectively , and @xmath71 and @xmath72 describe the transmission through the fiber from left to right and from right to left , respectively .",
    "since the fiber is assumed to be lossless and time - reversal , the scattering matrix must be a complex unitary symmetric matrix , ( @xmath73 @xmath74 ) .",
    "therefore , the four hermitian matrices @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 have the same set of eigenvalues @xmath79 .",
    "each of these @xmath63 transmission eigenvalues is a real number belong to the interval @xmath80 $ ] . assuming a unitary coupling among all transmission modes the overall transfer matrix @xmath81 can be described by a @xmath52 unitary matrix , where each entry",
    "@xmath82 represents the complex path gain from transmitted mode @xmath83 to received mode @xmath84 .",
    "moreover , the transmission matrix @xmath81 is haar distributed over the group of complex unitary matrices @xcite .",
    "given the fact that only @xmath85 and @xmath86 modes are addressed by the transmitter and receiver , respectively , the effective transmission channel matrix @xmath87 is a truncated is the @xmath58 upper - left corner of the transmission matrix @xmath81 @xcite ] version of @xmath81 . as a result ,",

    "in this section , we provide a new expression for the ergodic capacity in the setting of jacobi fading channels .",
    "we assume that the channel state information ( csi ) is known only at the receiver , not at the transmitter . the channel ergodic capacity , under a total average transmit power constraint ,",

    "<S> , we derive a similar formula for the ergodic capacity of the gaussian mimo channel . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical results are compared with monte carlo simulations and related results available in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> a perfect agreement is obtained .    </S>",
