    "finally we note that @xmath115 and this completes the proof .",
    "when we equip @xmath38 with the hyperbolic metric , the level line @xmath117 above is actually the hyperbolic geodesic generating the fundamental group of @xmath38 as @xmath118 is a hyperbolic isometry and @xmath113 is the hyperbolic geodesic generating the fundamental group of @xmath69 .",

    "it seems likely that the asymptotics are correct and that the constant @xmath124 can not be made smaller than @xmath125 .",
    "recall that the extremal function for @xmath38 is the composition @xmath71 where @xmath142 and @xmath72 is conformal .",
    "the level curve @xmath143 is therefore mapped by @xmath118 to the circle where @xmath144 and this is the circle of radius @xmath145 .",

    "we can therefore extend this mapping to the extended complex plane by setting @xmath150 for @xmath151 and observe that @xmath152 remains @xmath4-quasiconformal .",
    "now an arbitrary non separating continua @xmath0 can be approximated by a smoothly bounded disk @xmath153 , with @xmath154 , in the hausdorff topology .",
    "the family of quasiconformal self maps of @xmath155 that we obtain from the above argument with approximates @xmath156 and @xmath157 all have a uniform distortion bound , all are the identity on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and therefore this family does not converge to a constant in @xmath158 for any point @xmath159 .",
    "the compactness properties of quasiconformal mappings now provides us with a limit @xmath4-quasiconformal mapping which has all the desired properties to complete the proof once we further observe that the corresponding conformal maps will converge locally uniformly on @xmath160 and so for fixed @xmath161 and @xmath162 the limit level curves will be the level curves of the limit.@xmath116",
    "here we want to study the following extremal problem for quasiconformal mappings .",
    "let @xmath126 and identify the quasiconformal mapping of smallest distortion for which @xmath127 and for @xmath128 we require @xmath129 .",
    "we can identify a lower bound by considering various moduli .",
    "the hypotheses imply that @xmath130 and that @xmath131 .",
    "any @xmath4-quasiconformal mapping can distort capacity by at most a factor @xmath4 and hence any mapping with these properties must have distortion @xmath132 indeed it is well known that the extremal quasiconformal mappings between round annuli are the power mappings @xmath133 , @xmath134 , after suitable normalisation , and that these mappings are uniquely extremal up to a rotation .",
    "thus there is a map which effects both ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) and this radial mapping has the same boundary values on the common boundary @xmath135 and further , this mapping is the identity on @xmath136 and @xmath137 so that these bounds are both achieved .",
    "this establishes the next theorem .",

    "the hyperbolic metric density of the annulus @xmath163 can be found in @xcite as @xmath164 from this formula we compute that the length of the geodesic circle @xmath165 is @xmath166 the length of the geodesic generating the fundamental group of a doubly connected hyperbolic region uniquely determines the conformal equivalence class .",
    "next , we are going to establish a consequence of a result of a. beardon .",
    "this result is stated in his book in terms of a universal constraint on the geometry of hyperbolic elements in a fuchsian group and when reinterpreted we find the following theorem .",
