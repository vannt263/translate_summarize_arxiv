    "anderson localization of a quantum particle or a classical wave in a random environment [ ] is a vibrant research field [ ] .",
    "one of its central research directions is the physics of anderson transitions [ ] , including metal - insulator transitions and transitions of quantum hall type ( i.e. , between different phases of topological insulators ) .",
    "while such transitions are conventionally observed in electronic conductor and semiconductor structures , there is also a considerable number of other experimental realizations actively studied in recent and current works .",
    "these include localization of light [ ] and microwaves [ ] , cold atoms [ ] , ultrasound [ ] , and optically driven atomic systems [ ] .",
    "especially intriguing is the problem of the plateau transition in the integer quantum hall ( iqh ) effect .",
    "the nature of the critical state at and the critical phenomena near the iqh transition are at the focus of intense experimental [ ] and theoretical research [ ] .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that experiments aimed at understanding the critical behavior near the iqh transition usually study scaling of transport coefficients with temperature .",
    "such scaling inevitably involves the so - called dynamical critical exponent @xmath0 , and can only be explained if one takes into account some mechanism of dephasing of electronic wave functions , such as electron - electron interactions .",
    "the subject of the effects of interactions on the iqh transition is important , and we refer the reader to refs .",
    "one conclusion of this line of research is that if interaction between electrons is short ranged ( for example , due to screening ) , the interaction is irrelevant in the renormalization group sense , and does not change critical properties that do not involve temperature .",
    "correspondingly , the vast majority of existing theories of the iqh effect focus on models of noninteracting electrons in a strong magnetic field subject to disorder . depending on the nature of disorder , one can pursue two complementary approaches .",
    "the first , a field - theoretic approach , was developed for short - range ( gaussian white - noise ) disorder , where the correlation length of the disorder potential is much shorter than the magnetic length .",
    "this leads to a nonlinear sigma model with a topological term [ ] .",
    "khmelnitskii [ ] and pruisken [ , ] argued that the inclusion of the topological term yields a desirable delocalization in the middle of a landau band , and predicted a two - parameter flow diagram for the diagonal and hall conductivities .",
    "however , it was not possible to extract critical characteristics of the iqh transition from this theory .",
    "a different approach was developed for smooth disorder with correlation length much longer than the magnetic length , and strong magnetic fields , such that @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath3 the scattering time . in this limit",
    "landau bands are well resolved , and the semiclassical picture is that of the drift motion of an electron along equipotential lines of the disorder potential [ ] .",
    "based on this picture of chiral motion in strong magnetic field , chalker and coddington ( cc ) proposed a random network model of the quantum hall transition [ ] .",
    "remarkably , the cc model is very convenient for numerical simulations and captures both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the high - field iqh transition .",
    "moreover , the cc model and its triangular version [ ] admit a ( semi ) analytical treatment in terms of a real - space renormalization group [ , ] .    the idea of incorporating disorder via random phases on the links , on which the cc model was based , appeared to be very fruitful and turned the network - model approach into a powerful tool in numerical studies of disordered systems . by imposing proper symmetry requirements on phases on the links and scattering matrices at the nodes",
    ", one can build network - model realizations of disordered electronic systems in all 10 symmetry classes of altland and zirnbauer [ ] .",
    "these realizations often involve networks with multiple channels on the links due to higher symmetries of the scattering matrices .",
    "the disorder average in network models can be performed using either the replica method or the supersymmetry ( susy ) method of efetov [ ] adapted to networks [ , ] . in the replica formalism",
    ", network models in an anisotropic limit can be mapped to quantum spin chains .",
    "[ ] similarly , in the susy formalism one obtains superspin chains [ , , ] .",
    "a variant of the susy method was used to obtain a continuum limit of the cc model [ ] and to connect the field - theoretical and network - model approaches .",
    "the mapping to spin chains provides a way to study network models analytically and numerically .",
    "in particular , the superspin chain relevant for the cc model and the iqh transition has been numerically studied by the density matrix renormalization group method in ref . [ ] . also , the language of spin chains makes possible to use analogies with more conventional su(2 ) spin chains . later in this paper , we will use intuition gained from the study of su(2 ) spin systems .",
    "many such conventional su(2 ) spin chains are known to be integrable and amenable to exact solutions by bethe ansatz .",
    "this leads to a natural question as to whether integrability can shed light on the problem of the iqh and other anderson transitions .",
    "unfortunately , the direct implementation of the susy method for the cc model leads to a superspin chain that is not integrable .",
    "attempts to obtain integrable deformations of the cc model and the corresponding superspin chain have been made [ , ] .",
    "most likely , these modifications change the critical properties of the models , so their relevance to the iqh transition is not clear at present .",
    "the limit of weak magnetic fields , @xmath4 , is drastically different . in this limit , the electron motion is not purely chiral and the simple picture of the drift motion fails . as a consequence ,",
    "the cc model is not applicable .",
    "the nontrivial behavior of critical states in vanishing magnetic fields , the so - called phenomenon of levitation , was predicted by khmelnitskii [ ] and laughlin [ ] within the field - theoretic ( sigma model ) approach .",
    "they have argued that , when the magnetic field is decreased towards zero , delocalized states float above the fermi energy .",
    "subsequently , the levitation scenario became an essential component of the global phase diagram of the quantum hall effect [ ] and was confirmed by a number of experiments [ ] .",
    "however , theoretical attempts to understand its microscopic reasons were restricted to the region of weak levitation , @xmath5 , where delocalized states depart from the centers of landau bands only slightly .",
    "a minimal microscopic model which describes the levitation phenomenon , was proposed recently in ref .",
    "[ ] in terms of a certain random network .",
    "this model , named the @xmath6-@xmath7 model , captures the highly nontrivial interplay and competition of the disorder - induced scattering and the magnetic - field - induced weak orbital bending of electron trajectories , which leads to criticality .",
    "the mechanism governing the critical behavior in weak magnetic fields is very different from the one in strong fields , and leads to an even number ( at least two ) of channels on each link of the network , for two counterpropagating electron trajectories .",
    "numerical and semi - analytical analysis of ref .",
    "[ ] revealed the phase diagram of the @xmath6-@xmath7 model comprising an anderson insulator and two quantum hall phases , separated by a delocalization boundary , in agreement with predictions of the scaling theory .",
    "however , the semi - analytical treatment in ref .",
    "[ ] was carried out in the `` classical '' limit of strong disorder and was based on percolative arguments .",
    "it is by no means rigorous , and a more controlled analytical treatment of the @xmath6-@xmath7 model is desirable .    in this paper , we study the @xmath6-@xmath7 network model analytically .",
    "we use the susy approach of refs .",
    "[ , ] to map the @xmath6-@xmath7 model to an interacting superspin model .",
    "the superspins , which are certain irreducible representations of the lie superalgebra u@xmath8 ( @xmath9 is an integer ) , reside on the sites of a two - leg ladder .",
    "we treat the resulting superspin model by further mapping it to a supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model .",
    "prior to the sigma model treatment , in order to develop intuition , we discuss the case of the spin ladder where the superspins are replaced by the more familiar su@xmath10 spins . the motivation to do",
    "this is the following . in the susy formalism",
    ", the single cc network model is mapped to a single superspin chain , and the phenomenology of the iqh transition is that of the opening a gap in the superspin spectrum due to dimerization of the bonds of the chain .",
    "this is the same phenomenology that governs the critical behavior of the usual su@xmath10 spin chain with dimerization , even though the numerical values of critical exponents are different .",
    "we believe that in our case of the superspin ladder , we can still determine the overall structure of the phase diagram by considering ordinary su@xmath10 staggered spin ladders .",
    "these were extensively studied [ ] , and we use results of this research to gain intuition into the phase diagram of the @xmath6-@xmath7 model in the regions inaccessible to the sigma model description .",
