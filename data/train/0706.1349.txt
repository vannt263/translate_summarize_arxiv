    "owing to the non - perturbative nature of qcd in low energy regions , phenomenlogical models reflecting the characteristic of the strong interaction are widely used in the studying of the properties of hadrons , nuclear matter and quark matters[1 - 12 ] .",
    "they are based on different degrees of freedom , for example : nucleons and mesons , or quarks and gluons , in particular , on hybrid quarks and mesons .",
    "some of these models have been proved to be successful .",
    "the quark mass density - dependent model(qmdd)[5 ] is one of such candidates .    according to the qmdd model ,",
    "the masses of @xmath1 quarks and strange quarks ( and the corresponding anti - quarks ) are given by @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the baryon number density , @xmath5 is the current mass of the strange quark , and @xmath6 is the bag constant . at zero temperature @xmath7 where @xmath8 represent the density of u quark , d quark , and s quark , respectively .",
    "the basic hypothesis eqs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) corresponds to a quark confinement mechanism because if quark goes to infinite space , the volume of the system tends to infinite , @xmath9 approachs to zero and the @xmath10 goes to infinite , and the infinite quark mass prevents the quark from going to infinite .",
    "the confinement mechanism is similar to that of the mit bag model .",
    "although the qmdd model can provide a description of confinement and explain many dynamical properties of strange quark matter , but it is still an ideal quark gas model and can not explain the temperature t vs. density @xmath11 deconfinement phase diagram of qcd and the properties of nuclear matter[13 - 14 ] . to overcome this difficulty , we have introduced a coupling between quark and nonlinear scalar field to improve the qmdd model in a previous paper[15 ] .",
    "we have found the wave functions of the ground state and the lowest one - particle excited states . by using these wave functions , we calculated many physical quantities such as root - mean - squared radius , the magnetic moment of nucleon to compare with experiments and come to a conclusion that this improved qmdd model is successful to explain the properties of nucleon . in ref[16 ] , we extended this model to finite temperature and studied its soliton solution by means of the finite temperature quantum field theory .",
    "the critical temperature of quark deconfinement @xmath12 and the temperature - dependent bag constant @xmath13 are found . the results of improved qmdd(iqmdd ) model are qualitatively similar to that obtained from freidberg - lee soliton bag model[17 , 18 ] .    instead of studying the nucleon properties ,",
    "we hope to employ the iqmdd to investigate the physical properties of nuclear matter in this paper . as was shown by the walecka model[1 ] and",
    "the qmc model[7 - 10 ] early , a neutral vector field coupled to the conserved baryon current is very important for describing bulk properties of nuclear matter .",
    "the large neutral scalar and vector contributions have been observed empirically from nn scattering amplitude .",
    "the main qualitative features of the nucleon - nucleon interaction : a short range repulsion between baryons coming from @xmath14-meson exchange , and a long - range attraction between baryons coming from @xmath15-meson exchange must be included in a successful model . obviously , if we hope to employ the iqmdd model to mimick this repulsive and attractive interactions , except the quark and @xmath15-meson interaction , the @xmath0 meson and the @xmath16 coupling must be added .",
    "this motivate us to introduce @xmath0 mesons and the @xmath16 coupling in the iqmdd model in this paper . in this new iqmdd model ,",
    "the nonlinear scalar field coupling with quarks forms a soliton bag , and the @xmath16 vector coupling gives the repulsion between quarks .",
    "we will prove that this model can give us a successful description of nuclear matter .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we give the main formulae of the iqmdd model under the mean field approximation at zero temperature .",
    "in the third section , some numerical results are contained .",
    "the last section contains a summary and discussions .",

    "our numerical results will be shown in the next section .",

    "to study the physical properties of nuclear matter , we investigate the nuclear saturation , the equation of state and the compressibility .",

    "the compressibility for nuclear matter reads : @xmath65 at saturation point , the binding energy per particle @xmath66 mev , and the saturation density @xmath67 @xmath59 .",
    "our numerical results are shown in fig . 1-fig .",
    "4 . in fig . 1",
    ", we choose @xmath0-meson and @xmath15-meson satisfy @xmath68 and depict the bag energy as a function of bag radius at zero temperature .",
    "we find the stable radius of a `` free '' nucleon @xmath69 fm .    in figs . 2 - 4 we show the effective mass @xmath70 of nucleon , the saturation curve and the equations of state of nuclear matter at zero temperature for iqmdd model respectively , where we fix the parameter b=-1460 ( mev ) , @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively , and find @xmath73 mev and @xmath67 @xmath59 and @xmath74 mev .",
    "we find our model can explain the properties of nuclear matter successfully .    to illustrate our results more transparently , we show the dependence of the properties of nuclear matter on the parameters @xmath75 in table.1 for fixing binding energy @xmath73 mev and @xmath67 @xmath59 .",
