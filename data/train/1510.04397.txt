    "interference of coherent light occurs if there is a non - random phase difference between two or more beams . for example , in a michelson - morley ( mm ) or in a mach - zender ( mz ) interferometer , the two - beam relative phase is introduced by means of a path difference between the interferometer arms .",
    "the variation of this path difference allows to tune the temporal delay between the beams , as shown in fig .",
    "[ tbd - sketch](a ) , resulting in an interference pattern when the interferometer output intensity is observed as a function of the temporal delay . for these interferometers ,",
    "the maxima and minima on the intensity appear if the temporal delay is less or approximately equal to the temporal coherence of the light source , which in turn can be used to quantify its coherence time if we are dealing with a transform - limited pulse @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to notice that interference can be observed as well by performing a spectral analysis of the output electric field @xcite . in this second case ,",
    "a periodic modulation on the output intensity is obtained as a function of the frequency variable for a fixed temporal delay that is greater than the coherence time of the source .",
    "the latter fact was named as the alford and gold effect ( age ) by l. mandel @xcite , originally measured by w. p. alford and a. gold @xcite , and expressed in terms of light interference by m. p. givens @xcite .",
    "the age has been observed for single photons @xcite and for a pulsed laser @xcite using a mm interferometer .",
    "apart from the temporal domain , interference can also be observed in the spatial variables .",
    "for example , in the young s double - slit experiment , the separation between the two slits must be less or approximately equal to the spatial coherence length of the light source in order to observe a bright and dark fringe pattern @xcite .",
    "indeed , the fringe visibility of a double - slit interferometer gives a measure of the degree of spatial coherence for a finite - size light source @xcite .",
    "although the young s double - slit experiment is the usual choice to determine the spatial coherence of light , one may think on an alternative approach analogous to the way in which temporal coherence is quantified via a mm interferometer . in this paper , we achieve this goal by using a tunable beam displacer ( tbd ) similar to the one reported in @xcite .",
    "a tbd is a device that splits a light beam into two parallel - propagating beams , each one shifted by a tunable transverse distance @xmath0 with respect to the incoming beam , as shown in fig .",
    "[ tbd - sketch](b ) .",
    "the capability of tuning the separation between the two beams allows us to observe a spatial interference pattern as a function of @xmath0 , and therefore to have an analogous to the mm interference pattern as a function of the temporal delay . additionally , by measuring the tbd output intensity at the fourier plane",
    ", we observe a periodic intensity modulation similar to the temporal age with light pulses @xcite .",
    "the experimental results are in agreement with a direct correspondence between the temporal and spatial interference patterns measured by means of a mm or a mz interferometer and a tbd device , respectively .     with respect to the other . in ( b ) , the incoming beam is split into two beams that propagate in parallel , each one shifted by a transverse distance @xmath0 with respect to the incoming beam . the total tunable separation between the beams is @xmath1 . ]",
    "to put on solid ground the analogy between the tbd and the mm interferometer , let us consider the situation depicted in fig .",
    "[ tbd - sketch](b ) , in which a monochromatic , diagonally polarized , well - collimated gaussian beam enters to the tbd .",
    "the transverse momentum distribution @xmath2 for this incident beam is given by a gaussian function centered at @xmath3 , @xmath4\\right\\ } , \\label{fin}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the beam waist .",
    "then , the transverse component @xmath6 of the electric field in position variables of such a beam , corresponds to the fourier transform of @xmath7 , and is equal to @xmath8 with @xmath9 the electric field amplitude , @xmath10 the polarization vector chosen to be diagonal , and @xmath11 the conjugate vector of the transverse momentum @xmath12 . in the last expression , we have taken @xmath13 since we are only interested in fields shifted along the @xmath14-direction .",
    "note that the factor @xmath15 comes from considering a small beam deviation in the @xmath14-direction with respect to the @xmath16-axis , which is defined perpendicular to the tbd input plane @xcite .    at a fixed transverse plane after the tbd , the total electric field @xmath17 is proportional to the superposition of two fields shifted by distances @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "this is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a relative phase between the two fields that appears due to the working principle of the tbd .",
    "the total intensity @xmath22 is then given by @xmath23 when one is interested in the temporal coherence and uses a mm interferometer to measure it , one must integrate the total intensity with respect to time since the detectors are not fast enough to resolve the temporal changes on such intensity @xcite .",
    "spatially , we proceed in an analogous fashion by integrating the total intensity @xmath22 over the detection area @xmath24 . following this",
    ", the integrated intensity @xmath25 reads @xmath26 .",
    "\\label{itot}\\ ] ] from eq .",
    "( [ itot ] ) , one recognizes the usual interference pattern of partially coherent beams mediated by the transverse displacement @xmath0 . in analogy with the temporal interference in a mm interferometer , the gaussian factor accompanying the cosine function",
    "is proportional to the degree of spatial coherence of the source @xcite .",
    "it is then possible to recognize @xmath27 as the corresponding spatial coherence length .",
    "in particular , if @xmath0 is smaller or approximately equal to @xmath5 , the interference is revealed as an intensity modulation governed by the product of the cosine function and an envelope given by the gaussian term .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath0 is greater than @xmath5 , one gets a constant total intensity equal to @xmath28 since the exponential function vanishes .",

    "apart from observing the spatial interference , the tbd also allows to measure the spatial age .",
    "to observe this formally , one needs to calculate the intensity @xmath35 at the fourier plane , where @xmath36 is the fourier transform of the total electric field magnitude , @xmath37 since the effects of the tbd will only be observed in the @xmath14-direction , we take @xmath38 , so that @xmath39 becomes @xmath40 , \\label{stot}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 , and @xmath42 given by eq .",

    "observing eq .",
    "( [ stot ] ) , one notices again an intensity modulation of @xmath31 mediated by the cosine function , but in the conjugate variable @xmath43 .",
    "in particular , if the period of oscillation @xmath44 of the cosine function is greater than the width @xmath45 of @xmath31 ( fig .",
    "[ theory](c ) ) , there is no modulation , as depicted in fig . [",

    "this means that even if the two gaussian beams are far enough from each other in such a way that there is no interference pattern in the position variable , they do display an intensity modulation at the fourier plane , revealing a spatial analogous to the age .",
