    "given an algebraic curve @xmath4 of genus @xmath1 , it is an open problem to determine an equation for @xmath4 over its minimal field of definition @xmath3 .",
    "it is well known that the minimal field of definition is an algebraic extension of the field of moduli @xmath2 . while for small genus it is known how to construct such equations , in general this",
    "is still an open problem .",
    "the overall strategy is to describe the point in the moduli space @xmath5 corresponding to the given curve .",
    "this determines the field of moduli @xmath2 and the minimal field of definition @xmath3 is a finite extension of the field of moduli .",
    "however , describing the moduli point explicitly can be done only for superelliptic curves of small genus ; see @xcite .",
    "superelliptic curves are curves with affine equation @xmath6 .",
    "such curves have at least an automorphism of order @xmath7 .",
    "the quotient by the automorphism group of such curves is a genus 0 curve , hence a conic .",
    "this conic always has a rational point over a quadratic extension of the field of moduli .",
    "hence , for superelliptic curves @xmath8 \\leq 2 $ ]",
    ". if the automorphism group of @xmath4 is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order @xmath7 then an idea of clebsch can be extended to determine if the field of moduli is a field of definition .",
    "moreover an equation can be determined over the minimal field of definition .",
    "this is intended in @xcite .",
    "when the superelliptic curves have extra automorphisms , i.e. the automorphism group has size @xmath9 then the algorithm suggested above does not work .",
    "the isomorphism classes of such curves are determined by dihedral invariants ( or shaska invariants ) as in @xcite .",
    "in this short note we give an equation of superelliptic curves of genus @xmath1 with extra automorphisms over the minimal field of definition @xmath3 and determine the algebraic conditions in terms of such invariants of curves when the field of moduli is a field of definition .",
    "our main result is the following .",
    "let @xmath4 be a genus @xmath1 superelliptic curve , defined over @xmath10 , with an extra automorphism , @xmath11 its dihedral invariants , @xmath2 the field of moduli , and @xmath3 its minimal field of definition . then , + i ) the minimal field of definition @xmath3 is @xmath12    \\ii ) the equation of @xmath4 over @xmath3 is @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the discriminant of the above quadratic , @xmath16    hence , this provides an weierstrass equation of the curve over @xmath17 .",
    "an immediate consequence of the above result is that the field of moduli is a field of definition when the above quadratic has rational solutions .",
    "this happens if and only if @xmath18 is a complete square .",
    "it was noted in @xcite that when @xmath18 the automorphism group of the curve is larger and can be explicitly determined .",
    "the case when the genus @xmath19 is odd differs from the case when it is even . as a corollary",
    "we get that if @xmath20 then the field of moduli is a field of definition as noted in @xcite for hyperelliptic curves .",
    "the results of this paper determine when the field of moduli is a field of definition and give an equation of the curve over the minimal field of definition for almost all superelliptic curves with extra automorphism .",
    "the next natural thing to study is the case of the generic superelliptic curve , that is the curves with equation @xmath21 and automorphism group of order @xmath22 .",
    "such algorithm is given in @xcite for genus @xmath23 and it is intended in @xcite for all superelliptic curves .",
    "let @xmath0 be a genus @xmath24 curve with full automorphism group @xmath25 .",
    "the curve @xmath0 is called a * superelliptic curve * if there exists an element @xmath26 which is central in @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "denote by @xmath29 the cyclic group generated by @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "thus , @xmath32 is called the reduced automorphism group of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath29 .",
    "superelliptic curves are curves with affine equation @xmath21 . denote with @xmath33 the function field of @xmath0 and by @xmath34 the genus zero subfield of @xmath3 fixed by @xmath29 . then , @xmath35=n$ ] , where @xmath36 .",
    "the group @xmath37 is a subgroup of the group of automorphisms of a genus zero curve .",
    "therefore , @xmath38 and @xmath37 is finite .",
    "then , @xmath37 is isomorphic to one of the following groups @xmath39 .",
    "since @xmath27 is a degree @xmath7 extension of @xmath37 and we know the possible groups that occur as @xmath37 , it is possible to determine @xmath27 and the equation of @xmath3 , see @xcite .    the group @xmath40 acts on @xmath34 via the natural way .",
    "the fixed field of this action is a genus 0 field , say @xmath41 .",
    "thus , @xmath42 is a degree @xmath43 rational function in @xmath44 , say @xmath45 .    given a superelliptic curve @xmath0 with equation @xmath21 such that @xmath46 , the genus of the curve can be calculated using the following formula @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "if @xmath49 and @xmath7 are relatively prime then @xmath50 , see @xcite for proof .",
    "much interesting to us are superelliptic curves with extra automorphism .",
    "let @xmath0 be a superelliptic curve that has an extra automorphism @xmath51 such that its projection @xmath52 has order @xmath53 .",
    "then the equation of the superelliptic curve is given as @xmath54 or @xmath55 , for some @xmath56 $ ] , see @xcite for proof . in other words",
    "@xmath0 has equation @xmath57 or @xmath58 for both cases",
    "the dihedral invariants of such curves or _ shaska - invariants _ denoted by @xmath59-invariants are defined in @xcite .",
    "they were discovered by shaska in his thesis for curves of genus 2 with extra automorphisms and later generalized to all hyperelliptic curves in @xcite for all hyperelliptic curves with extra automorphisms .",
    "such invariants are used by many authors in computational aspects of hyperelliptic and superelliptic curves such as duursma , ritzenthaler , lauter , lercier , et al .",
    "we define them for our purposes in the next section .",
    "let @xmath0 be a superelliptic curve defined over a field @xmath60 , @xmath61 such that @xmath0 has an extra involution and its weierstrass equation is given by @xmath62 our main goal is to find an equation of this curve defined over its minimal field of definition .",
    "the corresponding moduli point of such curves is determined by the dihedral invariants @xmath63 and the field of moduli is @xmath64 .",
    "recall that the dihedral invariants are defined as follows @xmath65 notice that these invariants are homogenous polynomials of degree @xmath66 to 2 respectively .",
    "the field of moduli of the corresponding curve is given by @xmath67 .",
    "our goal is to find a weierstrass equation over @xmath67 of the curve in eq .  .",
    "we perform a coordinate change @xmath68 { a_s } \\ , x\\ ] ] to get @xmath69 denote by @xmath70",
    ". then we have @xmath14 this quadratic has discriminant @xmath71 the equation of the curve becomes @xmath72 we will show that all coefficients @xmath73 , @xmath74 can be expressed in terms of the dihedral invariants and @xmath75 . hence , we have an equation of the curve over the quadratic extension @xmath76 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a genus @xmath1 superelliptic curve , defined over @xmath10 , with an extra automorphism , @xmath11 its dihedral invariants , @xmath2 the field of moduli , and @xmath3 its minimal field of definition .",
