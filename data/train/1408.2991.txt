    "i.e. the associated production of higgs and @xmath51 bosons in laser - boosted lepton collisions , for both circular and linear polarization .",
    "the collision energy can , by applying an intense laser field , be increased since the particle beam that propagates along with the laser wave will be substantially accelerated by the field . because the counterpropagating particle beam is virtually unaffected by this effect , this results in an asymmetric collision geometry @xcite .",
    "the biggest advantage of linear as compared to circular polarization for our setup lies in the fact that , in order to keep the colliding particles inside the laser wave , smaller spatial extensions of the laser beam and thus a smaller pulse power are necessary . in a circularly polarized laser field , on the other hand , the total cross section and thus the number of produced higgs bosons is the same as without the laser field , which , depending on the laser intensity parameter @xmath49 , can be much larger than the outcome in a linearly polarized laser field .",
    "we have also found that , due to the larger mass and thus smaller lorentz factor for muon - antimuon collisions as compared to electron - positron collisions with the same initial energy , the required laser pulse parameters are in favor of muon - antimuon collisions in such a highly energetic process . furthermore , the reduction of the collider luminosity due to the geometry of the laser pulse estimates to be larger for electron - positron collisions , since the required laser pulse needs to have a larger spatial extension than for muon - antimuon collisions . the luminosity loss can be reduced by suitably adjusting the photon energy and beam extensions , as we have seen in sec .",

    "[ otherprocesses ] , we have shown the calculation for the process @xmath211 , i.e. muon pair production in laser - boosted electron - positron collisions , again for circular and linear laser field polarization .",
    "this process and the higgs boson production process discussed earlier , despite being of different natures , show very similar characteristics .",

    "[ otherprocesses ] , we briefly discussed the resonant production of hadrons in laser - boosted lepton collisions .",
    "we presume that the general characteristics will be the same as for the two processes investigated in detail .",
    "the resonance @xmath212 is , in principle , in reach of the eli laser pulse when combined with electron - positron beams , even in the case of circular polarization . for the creation of particles with higher rest masses ,",
    "muon - antimuon collisions are favorable .",
    "+ between the production of muon pairs and resonant @xmath213 meson production in laser - boosted electron - positron collisions and @xmath5 meson production in muon - antimuon collisions , we identified several possible proof - of - principle experiments that might be realizable in the near to intermediate future . while the experimental demands for the collider scheme considered in this paper are certainly ambitious , it might be interesting to investigate its feasibility in such an experiment and to investigate the opportunities it might be able to offer in future particle colliders .",
