    "although the study of magnetoresistance in ferromagnets started as early as 1857 with the measurements of anisotropic magnetoresistance in nickel and iron by william thomson ( lord kelvin ) , recent years have witnessed a tremendous interest into magnetotransport phenomena in magnetic oxides .",
    "studies were stimulated by the discovery of `` colossal magnetoresistance '' ( cmr ) in ferromagnetic perovskites of the type @xmath0 .",
    "the so - called manganites display a rich phase diagram as a function of temperature , magnetic field and doping that is due to the intricate interplay of charge , spin , orbital and lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "colossal magnetoresistance is found on a magnetic field scale of several teslas being not very appealing for applications .",
    "accordingly , many research groups focused on the investigation of extrinsic magnetoresistance effects found in various magnetic oxides , since these promised a large magnetoresistance ratio in low magnetic fields . to a large extent this research is driven by the rapid increase of data storage density in magnetic storage devices . since read heads for hard disks employ magnetoresistive read - out techniques , progressive miniaturization of sensors requires materials or heterostructures with increasing magnetoresistive effect",
    "the development of hard disk storage media is currently very rapid with a doubling of storage density about every nine months .",
    "therefore , the need for more efficient magnetoresistive sensors will persist in the future .",
    "it has to be clear that room temperature performance is the most vital criterion in judging new magnetoresistive materials .    in this review",
    "intrinsic and extrinsic magnetoresistive effects are distinguished .",
    "whereas intrinsic effects are found in the bulk of the ferromagnetic material and are determined by material parameters , extrinsic effects are only found at defect structures , in suitable artificial heterostructures and devices .",
    "this distinction is not unique , since impurity scattering plays a vital role in some of the effects and is per se an extrinsic effect .",
    "extrinsic magnetotransport effects in ferromagnetic oxides fall into three broad classes , namely grain - boundary magnetoresistance , spin - polarized transport in ferromagnetic tunnelling junctions and domain - wall magnetoresistance .",
    "it was realized that manganite samples containing a large number of extended defects such as grain boundaries display a huge low field magnetoresistance much larger than the intrinsic magnetoresistance ( hwang 1996 , gupta 1996 ) .",
    "various samples have been studied , namely polycrystalline ceramics and films , pressed powders , single grain boundaries on bi - crystal substrates , scratched substrates , step - edge and laser - patterned junctions .",
    "the extrinsic effect therefore appears under various names such as grain - boundary magnetoresistance , junction magnetoresistance ( jmr ) and powder magnetoresistance ( pmr ) .",
    "however , the basic physical mechanism behind these phenomena appears to be the same .",
    "this mechanism is likely to be spin - polarized tunnelling , although a final consensus on the interpretaion of grain boundary magnetoresistance has not yet been reached ; this conclusion links the investigations of transport properties near extended defects to another class of extrinsic magnetoresistance : spin - polarized tunnelling in heterostructures .",
    "such a heterostructure consists of two ferromagnetic layers separated by an insulating layer .",
    "the tunnelling current is found to depend sensitively on the relative magnetization direction in the ferromagnetic electrodes .",
    "this is related to the spin - dependent density of states at the fermi level .",
    "it is useful to define a spin - polarization at the fermi level that quantifies the spin - imbalance in itinerant ferromagnets ; the elemental ferromagnets fe , co and ni have spin - polarizations of 45% , 42% and 31% , respectively .",
    "spin - polarized tunnelling in a thin film heterostructure and the basic theory was first discussed by julliere ( 1975 ) .",
    "however , an even earlier work on magnetic tunnelling junctions using manganite electrodes was reported by van den brom and volger ( 1968 ) .",
    "early experiments yielded only small magnetoresistive effects and the reproducibility of the junctions was poor .",
    "a breakthrough was achieved by the work of moodera ( 1995 ) reporting magnetoresistance ratios in excess of 20% in permalloy/@xmath1/cofe junctions at low temperature in agreement with julliere s model ; at room temperature effects of about 10% were recorded .",
    "experimental work on manganite tunnelling junctions started at about the same time ( sun 1996 ) .",
    "these studies were stimulated by band - structure calculations that indicated the half - metallic nature of ferromagnetic manganite oxides .",
    "the concept of a half - metal was introduced by de groot ( 1983 ) motivated by band - structure calculations of mn - based heusler alloys ; a half - metal is defined as having a metallic density of states in one of the spin channels and a gap in the density of states in the other spin channel ; within any reasonable definition of spin - polarization this corresponds to a spin - polarization value of 100% .",
    "the concept of spin - polarization is central to the theory of spin - polarized tunnelling ; the only parameters entering julliere s model for the tunnelling magnetoresistance are the spin - polarizations of the ferromagnetic electrodes ; in the case of half - metallic metals the magnetoresistance ratio is expected to reach 100% .",
    "this is intuitively clear , since in the absence of spin - flips , a tunnelling current can not flow between half - metallic electrodes with antiparallel magnetization directions , since there is no density of states at the fermi level of the other electrode into which electrons could be tunnelling",
    ". therefore , spin - polarized tunnelling in heterostructures using half - metallic electrodes is promising for applications and , at the same time , theoretically challenging , since the dependence of the tunnelling current on the band structure and barrier properties is not yet fully understood .",
    "the first experiments on manganite - insulator - manganite tunnelling junctions showed large magnetotunnelling effects at low temperatures ( lu 1996 ) .",
    "the magnetoresistance ratio , however , decreases rapidly with temperature .",
    "a future experimental challenge is the achievement of a huge room temperature magnetoresistance in magnetic oxide heterostructures .",
    "apart from the manganites , cro@xmath2 , magnetite ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath4 are suspected to be half - metallic magnets and are investigated in view of device applications .",
    "a long - standing problem is the question of the magnetoresistance of a domain wall . within a domain",
    "the magnetization vector and therefore the majority and minority currents have spatially independent orientations . accordingly",
    ", when charge carriers cross a domain wall , majority electrons may end up in the minority channel and vice versa leading to an additional magnetoresistance .",
    "an obvious measure of the scattering efficiency of a domain wall is the ratio between the time of passage through the domain wall and the precession period of the spin around the exchange field . in the adiabatic limit scattering effects",
    "are likely to be small , whereas these are expected to become appreciable in the ballistic regime .",
    "this review is divided into two parts .",
    "the first part starts with a brief overview over the materials as well as the definition and measurement of the spin - polarization in section  [ materials ] .",
    "section  [ optical ] deals with the temperature dependent resistivity and the optical conductivity , whereas the intrinsic magnetoresistance is analyzed in section  [ intrinsic ] .",
    "these sections were included in order to elucidate the basic models for magnetotransport in the relevant oxides and to facilitate comparison with and identification of extrinsic magnetotransport phenomena .",
    "the presentation is restricted to a discussion of resistivity as the basic transport coefficient and does not include other valuable transport coefficients such as thermopower , hall effect , etc .",
    "this is due to space limitations and the idea to use this review as a handbook in the evaluation of resistivity behaviours encountered in studies of magnetic oxides . in the second part",
    "extrinsic magnetotransport phenomena are reviewed .",
    "an overview of recent developments in the study of domain - wall scattering in both elemental ferromagnets and the manganites is given in section  [ dw ] .",
    "section  [ lcmometal ] presents a discussion of various interface properties between magnetic oxides and normal metals , superconductors and conventional ferromagnets .",
    "sections  [ tunnelling ] and [ jmr ] contain the main experimental data and theoretical models relating to spin - polarized tunnelling and grain - boundary magnetoresistance , respectively . in the section on spin - polarized tunnelling",
    "appropriate room is given to the discussion of recent results for tunnelling junctions made from elemental ferromagnets in order to constitute background information for the discussion of the oxide magnets .",
    "the discussion of grain - boundary magnetoresistance concentrates on magnetic oxides , since grain - boundaries of elemental ferromagnets do not form junctions with tunnelling - like characteristics . in section  [ summary ] a summary of significant results and an outlook into the budding field of spin - electronics",
    "is given .",
    "the bulk of recent investigations on the magnetotransport properties of oxides deals with cmr materials .",
    "the number of publications on this subject grows exponentially and it is virtually impossible to write a fully comprehensive review .",
    "therefore , it might be helpful to point out some review articles on related topics .",
    "an excellent and extensive review on the physical properties of mixed - valence manganites was written by coey , viret and von molnr ( 1999 ) ; this review is mainly focused on intrinsic properties .",

    "often transport properties are of interest , especially for applications . in a ferromagnet",
    "the majority and minority carriers can be regarded as two parallel transport channels , see mott ( 1936 ) , campbell and fert ( 1982 ) , and a definition of the spin - polarization in terms of the majority ( @xmath42 ) and minority ( @xmath43 ) current densities seems more appropriate . within classical boltzmann transport theory , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 denotes a fermi - surface average and",

    "( [ pj ] ) defined via the currents .",
    "if a specular barrier is present , the tunnelling current depends in a more complex way on both the fermi velocity and the barrier transparency , and the measured spin - polarization does not agree with any of the definitions introduced so far .",
    "this analysis shows that experimental values obtained with different techniques relate to different definitions of the spin - polarization that need not necessarily agree .",
    "the concept of half - metallicity was introduced by de groot ( 1983 ) on the basis of band - structure calculations of heusler alloys .",
    "these calculations showed a gap in the density of states of minority carriers .",
    "half - metallicity is an independent particle concept and the inclusion of many - body - effects leads to the appearance of non - quasiparticle states extending down to the fermi level , see irkhin and katsnelson ( 1994 ) .",

    "the situation is not clear for @xmath3 , especially since it is not possible to perform andreev reflection measurements due to the insulating nature of magnetite at low temperatures .",

    "the transport properties of magnetite are analyzed ; magnetite is a strongly correlated ferrimagnet with significant polaronic effects and represents a class of its own .",
    "since the resistivity depends sensitively on grain boundaries , see later sections , it is important to perform resistivity measurements on high quality single crystals and epitaxial films . since research activity in recent years mainly focused on the colossal magnetoresistance perovskites , the bulk of this section will be devoted to this system .",
    "apart from the specific mechanisms relating to the individual systems , the issue of a minimal conductivity has re - emerged .",
    "this is due to the fact that many metallic oxides such as the ferromagnetic compounds discussed here as well as high temperature superconductors apparently violate the ioffe - regel limit ( ioffe and regel 1960 , see also mott 1978 ) .",
    "this concept is based on the idea that the mean free path @xmath109 can not be smaller than the interatomic spacing @xmath110 . in order to fix ideas ,",
    "a simple estimate that should be valid for srruo@xmath26 in the paramagnetic phase can be made .",
    "srruo@xmath26 is particularly interesting , since shubnikov - de haas oscillations have been observed at low temperatures indicating fermi - liquid behaviour ( mackenzie 1998 ) . assuming a typical metallic carrier density @xmath111  m@xmath112 , a fermi velocity @xmath113  m / s ( allen 1996 ) and an interatomic distance @xmath114   , one finds from drude theory a maximal resistivity @xmath115 srruo@xmath26 displays at room temperature a resistivity of about 200  @xmath116 cm already close to the estimated saturation value .",
    "allen ( 1996 ) measured the resistivity of a srruo@xmath26 single crystal and found a linear dependence between room temperature and 1000  k without any sign of saturation up to a resistivity value of 300  @xmath116 cm .",
    "other ferromagnetic oxides discussed here also show resistivities of the same order of magnitude without any tendency to saturation .",
    "this behaviour is distinctly different from the resistivity curves found in a-15 compounds such as nb@xmath26sn which show an apparent saturation towards a value @xmath117  @xmath116 cm ( wiesmann 1977 ) .",
    "fisk and webb ( 1976 ) interpreted this resistivity saturation in terms of a saturation of the mean free path towards the interatomic distance in accordance with the ioffe - regel limit .",
    "the lack of saturation seen in many oxides motivated emery and kivelson ( 1995 ) to introduce the term `` bad metal '' meaning a system with a positive resistivity coefficient , @xmath118 , and a mean free path at high temperature smaller than the interatomic distance .",
    "these authors speculated that such systems could not be described within a fermi - liquid picture with weak scattering .",
    "a solution to this problem was indicated by millis ( 1999 ) investigating electrons coupled to classical phonons with an arbitrary strong coupling .",
    "the resistivity was calculated within dynamical mean field theory .",
    "these calculations show a linear temperature dependence of the resistivity at small coupling and a linear temperature dependence with a non - zero offset at large coupling constants ; these features are reminiscent of the saturation behaviour in a-15 compounds .",
    "however , a comparison of the numerical results to second order perturbation calculations shows that at strong electron - phonon couplings , the scattering rate increases with temperature at a rate much smaller than that given by perturbation theory .",
    "this indicates that the term `` saturation '' is a misnomer and that the apparent violation of the ioffe - regel limit is not per se a remarkable feature .",
    "actually , at high temperatures classical diffusion might be expected leading to a linear temperature dependence of the resistivity according to the einstein relation @xmath119 where @xmath120 denotes the diffusion constant .",
    "although the debate on a minimal metallic conductivity is certainly not exhausted , the apparent violation of the ioffe - regel limit in certain oxides with strongly coupled electron - phonon systems might not be an experimental smoking gun in regard to exotic transport theories .",
    "srruo@xmath26 is a strongly - correlated ferromagnetic @xmath27-band metal .",
    "the curie temperature in the bulk is 165  k ; for thin films reduced curie temperatures of 150  k were observed possibly due to strain effects ( klein 1996 ) .",
    "magnetization measurements on single crystals ( cao 1997 ) showed a magnetic moment of about @xmath121 per ru@xmath23 ion . within an ionic model , the fivefold degeneracy of the ru ( @xmath122 ) states is split by the octahedral crystalline field due to the o ions into two - thirds occupied t@xmath123 and empty e@xmath124 levels . thus , ru@xmath23 is in a low spin state with an ideal value of the magnetic moment of @xmath98 .",
    "the magnetization does not reach this ideal limit indicating the itinerant character of the ferromagnetism .",

    "the resistivity increases strongly from residual resistivity values of about 4  @xmath116 cm in high quality films to about 200  @xmath116 cm at room temperature .",
    "klein ( 1996 ) reported anomalously strong spin - scattering as evidenced by a resistivity derivative @xmath126 of srruo@xmath26 being much larger than that of iron ; these authors speculated that this might be related to the `` bad metal '' property .",

    "thus , srruo@xmath26 is close to being a half - metal ; mazin and singh ( 1997 ) pointed out that this nearly half - metallic character is important for understanding the transport properties .",

    "kostic ( 1998 ) measured @xmath128 for temperatures between 40  k and 250  k. at low temperatures the real part of the optical conductivity was found to decrease with frequency as @xmath129 , a behaviour that is difficult to reconcile with standard fermi - liquid theory predicting @xmath130 at comparable frequencies . at higher temperatures",
    "the low frequency conductivity was actually found to increase with frequency indicating the opening of an optical gap in contrast with the general characteristics of metals .",
    "accordingly , kostic ( 1998 ) concluded that srruo@xmath26 shows non - fermi - liquid behaviour and derived frequency dependent scattering times and effective masses .",
    "this work was extended by dodge ( 2000 ) who employed terahertz time - domain and far - infrared spectroscopy to measure the conductivity over three decades in frequency .",
    "the results can be analyzed with a conductivity @xmath131 yielding an exponent @xmath132 in contrast to the drude result @xmath133 .",
    "the authors conclude that srruo@xmath26 displays non - fermi liquid behaviour in the temperature 5  k @xmath13495  k and investigated frequency regime . at still lower energies , however , the observation of shubnikov - de haas oscillations in the resistivty of srruo@xmath26 films at 35  mk by mackenzie ( 1998 ) strongly suggests a ground state that is actually a fermi - liquid .",
    "accordingly , the fermi - liquid state in srruo@xmath26 might display some fragility leading to a breakdown of this concept at energies much lower than in conventional metals .",
    "the carrier mean free path was estimated by kostic ( 1998 ) using the measured scattering times and fermi velocities derived from band - structure calculations . at 145  k ,",
    "the mean free path for majority and minority carriers was found to be about 0.6  nm and 1.2  nm , respectively .",
    "these values are comparable to the size of the unit cell and clearly show that srruo@xmath26 is a `` bad metal '' .",
    "mazin and singh ( 1997 ) argued that there is a strong coupling between electrons , phonons and magnons that probably produces significant spin - flip scattering .",
    "furthermore , the fermi - surface has a complex topology with electron- and hole - like sheets in each spin channel . assuming electron - phonon and electron - paramagnon scattering mazin and singh ( 1997 ) argued that the resistivity is linear in temperature at high temperatures with the coefficient proportional to the sum of the coupling constants .",
    "the coupling constants derived from resistivity and specific heat data are in reasonable agreement in support of the above picture .",
    "the change in slope of the resistivity while warming through the curie temperature is explained by a change from electron - magnon scattering to electron - paramagnon scattering , the latter having a weaker coupling .",
    "the quadratic temperature dependence of the resistivity at low temperatures is due to electron - magnon scattering , again with an extraordinary large coupling constant . in summary",
    ", the transport properties of srruo@xmath26 can be qualitatively understood on the basis of band - structure calculations and boltzmann transport - theory .",
    "this is in agreement with the general results by millis ( 1999 ) on the resistivity of a metal with strong electron - phonon coupling , see above .",
    "the pyrochlore @xmath13 has a curie temperature of about 140  k with a saturation magnetic moment of @xmath136 per formula unit corresponding to a ferromagnetic ordering of the mn@xmath23 ions ( shimakawa 1997 ) .",
    "the transport and magnetotransport properties are similar to the cmr manganites , namely : metallic transport below @xmath9 crossing over to semiconducting behaviour above @xmath9 ; near the curie temperature a large magnetoresistance is seen .",
    "typical resistivity data are shown in figure  [ imai](b ) .",
    "these properties make the pyrochlore interesting in comparison to the manganites , since they , especially the large magnetoresistance , do not seem to arise from a double exchange mechanism ( shimakawa 1997 , kwei 1997 , majumdar and littlewood 1998a , 1998b , imai 2000 ) .",
    "the carrier density of @xmath13 is small of the order of 0.001 - 0.005 per formula unit ( shimakawa 1996 , raju 1994 ) and depends on temperature and magnetic field ( imai 2000 ) , see figure  [ imai](a ) .",
    "this carrier density is supposed to be too small to give rise to significant double exchange effects .",
    "x - ray and neutron diffraction studies did not indicate any structural changes near the curie temperature ( shimakawa 1997 ) , thus ruling out any spin - lattice or charge - lattice coupling .",
    "the compound does not show any significant jahn - teller distortion in accordance with the idea that manganese is in a mn@xmath23 ionization state which is not jahn - teller active . a comparison of the magnetic and transport properties of @xmath137 pyrochlores with a = y , lu , in and tl shows ferromagnetic order for all compounds with the curie temperature varying from 15  k ( @xmath138 and @xmath139 ) to 140  k ( @xmath140 and @xmath13 ) .",

    "band - structure calculations using the local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) ( lewis 1997 ) and lsda+u ( korotin 1998 ) indicate half - metallic behaviour with a finite density of states at the fermi level for the majority carriers and a gap of about 1.5  ev in the minority density of states .",
    "the bands crossing the fermi energy are predominantly of o(2@xmath148 ) character ; thus , these can be viewed as charge reservoirs leading to a non - integral occupation of the @xmath27-bands , a mechanism called `` self - doping '' by korotin ( 1998 ) .",
    "an almost dispersionless majority spin - band is located about 1  ev below the fermi energy and is an almost pure @xmath27-band in character .",

    "the issue of phase separation in manganites is not new .",
    "already the first extensive neutron study of @xmath258 by wollan and koehler ( 1955 ) reported the co - existence of ferromagnetic and a - type antiferromagnetic reflections in non - stoichiometric lamno@xmath26 ( 14 , 18 and 20% mn@xmath23 ) and in @xmath259 .",
    "the authors concluded : `` the fact that the magnetic measurements show the ( 200 ) and ( 220 ) ferromagnetic reflections to be field sensitive and the superstructure reflections ( 100 ) and ( 210 ) to be unaffected by the field is strong evidence in favour of accounting for the overall magnetic structure of samples in this composition range as consisting of an incoherent mixture of ferro- and antiferromagnetic regions or domains . '' astonishingly enough , this major experimental work was published five years before the theoretical work of de gennes ( 1960 ) who interpreted the spin structure at low dopings as a canted antiferromagnet . within de gennes model the spontaneous magnetization at low doping is proportional to the doping ( de gennes 1960 ) .",
    "khomskii ( 2000 ) pointed out that the electron energy in this approximation is given by @xmath260 such that @xmath261 and accordingly the compressibility is negative .",
    "this indicates the instability of the canted state and a tendency to phase separation ; for more detailed arguments see kagan ( 1999 ) and arovas and guinea ( 1998 ) .",
    "this discussion is far from being settled , see e.g.  the magnetization data by geck ( 2001 ) that support evidence for a canted antiferromagnetic state in @xmath262 single crystals .",
    "intimately related to the concept of phase separation is the idea of percolation of insulating and metallic regions .",
    "a percolation mechanism for the metal - insulator transition was proposed by bastiaansen and knops ( 1998 ) .",
    "starting from a half - metallic band - structure , where electrons can propagate only in magnetic domains with the magnetization parallel to the electron spin , the metal - insulator transition temperature corresponds to the percolation threshold for magnetic domains . above @xmath9 both majority and minority carriers percolate leading to a resistivity decrease .",
    "monte - carlo simulations of resistor networks within the ising model including nearest neighbour and next - nearest neighbour bonds yielded qualitative agreement with experimental data concerning both the temperature variation of the resistivity and the influence of a magnetic field ( bastiaansen and knops 1998 ) . since this model does not take into account the gradual spin precession in the rather thick domain walls , it is unlikely to capture the essential physics of the manganites . however , in the light of recent results on phase separation ( moreo 1999 ) , percolation of metallic and semiconducting regions might occur near @xmath9 , especially in compounds with a low curie temperature .",
    "the manganites have a tendency to segregate into hole - rich ferromagnetic metallic and undoped antiferromagnetic insulating regions",
    ". these might coexist near the metal - insulator transition , such that the resistivity below @xmath9 is determined by percolating metallic regions .",
    "scanning - tunnelling microscopy studies of lcmo single crystals and films revealed the coexistence of metallic and semiconducting regions on length scales of several 10  nm ( fth 1999 ) .",
    "the application of a magnetic field leads to the reversible growth of metallic regions .",
    "the origin of this phase separation is not fully understood , since a separation into differently charged regions is energetically unfavourable due to the long range coulomb interaction .",
    "therefore , the experimental findings might be related to structural disorder like twinning , variation of the oxygen content or cation disorder ( fth 1999 ) .",
    "uehara ( 1999 ) reported a percolation transition in @xmath263 as evidenced by electron microscopy . in this sytem phase separation into metallic ferromagnetic and charge - ordered insulating domains occurs on a sub - micrometer scale .",
    "this phase separation is not of a charge - segregation type , but is one between the optimally doped ferromagnetic and @xmath264 charge - ordered states .",

    "this assertion was later contested by rdiger ( 1999a ) on the grounds of magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) studies and micromagnetic modelling of co wires .",
    "viret ( 1996 ) tried to extract the domain - wall resistance in co and ni films by adding the longitudinal and transverse magnetoresistance and identifying the non - vanishing contributions with domain - wall contributions .",
    "this method relies on the fact that the anisotropic magnetoresistance depends on the square of the cosine of the angle between magnetization and current , such that the amr adds to a constant when measured before and after a field or current rotation by 90@xmath127 .",

    "since the observed effects are very small , these assumptions are doubtful .",
    "both gregg ( 1996 ) and viret ( 1996 ) found a positive domain - wall resistivity .",

    "the domain structures in these wires were characterized using mfm and micromagnetic modelling .",
    "the co wires have a perpendicular anisotropy such that the magnetization within a domain is oriented along the surface normal .",
    "mfm and micromagnetic modelling , however , show that flux - closure domains exist ; the fraction of the flux - closure caps depends on the film thickness varying between 35% and 17% for thicknesses between 50 and 200  nm .",
    "the existence of these flux - closure domains was neglected by gregg ( 1996 ) .",
    "the magnetoresistance in these wires is due to normal state ( lorentz ) magnetoresistance , anisotropic magnetoresistance as well as a domain - wall contribution .",
    "the anisotropic magnetoresistance in fe and co is positive , i.e.  @xmath348 .",
    "in contrast , the lorentz magnetoresistance shows the opposite behaviour , i.e.  the transverse mr is larger than the longitudinal mr . since the lorentz magnetoresistance depends on the local induction , a considerable normal state magnetoresistance due to the large saturation magnetization in fe ( @xmath349  t ) and co ( @xmath350  t ) is present even at zero applied field .",
    "this leads to the existence of a compensation temperature with equal resistivities of magnetic domains oriented perpendicular or parallel to the current .",
    "these resistivities are obtained by extrapolation of the normal state resistivity above saturation .",
    "the compensation temperatures are about 65  k for fe and 85  k for co , respectively . in the absence of domain wall effects , at the compensation temperature the resistivity measured in zero field should agree with that determined by extrapolation .",
    "the experiment , however , shows a negative resistivity contribution in fe films for thicknesses below 100  nm due to domain walls , see figure  [ kent ] .",
    "this negative contribution increases with domain - wall density and decreases with film thickness . at other temperatures ,",
    "the domain - wall resistivity can be estimated by the difference in the measured resistivity and the resistivity estimated from the high field extrapolation combined with the measured domain configuration .",
    "this yields a negative domain - wall resistivity in fe wires persisting up to temperatures of about 80  k. in co the situation is different .",
    "the measured resistivities are always very close to the effective resistivities calculated from the extrapolation values and the measured domain configuration .",
    "however , at the compensation temperature of about 85  k a small positive contribution to the magnetoresistance ratio of @xmath351 is found .",
    "this is consistent with an additional contribution due to domain - wall scattering .",
    "a report on domain - wall resistance in co zig - zag wires found a negative domain - wall contribution of @xmath352 at 5  k ( taniyama 1999 ) .",
    "this persists up to 200  k. an investigation by ebels ( 2000 ) on 35  nm thin co wires identified a steplike resistance increase of about @xmath353-@xmath354 . in these thin wires",
    "the c - axis grows parallel to the wire axis and both shape and crystal anisotropy lead to magnetic domains being oriented along the wire . during a hysteresis loop in a parallel magnetic field head - to - head domain walls can be induced that supposedly lead to the resistance increase .",
    "this discussion shows that the experimental situation is controversial ; the status of theoretical studies is also far from being clearcut .",
    "the analogy between a domain wall and a metallic multilayer system intuitively leads to the idea of a positive resistivity contribution of the domain wall .",
    "this idea was advanced by gregg ( 1996 ) and later confirmed by levy and zhang ( 1997 ) by a more rigorous calculation .",
    "these treatments visualize an itinerant electron traversing the domain wall and adiabatically tracking the rotating exchange field .",
    "majority and minority carriers in the bulk conduct in parallel with different resistivities @xmath355 , @xmath356 .",
    "levy and zhang ( 1997 ) showed that the carrier wave functions in the domain wall contain contributions of both spin orientations , thus facilitating a spin mixing that leads to an additional resistivity due to the different resistivities for majority and minority carriers .",
    "the domain - wall resistivity was found to be anisotropic with respect to the current direction relative to the domain wall .",
    "this anisotropy was investigated by viret ( 2000 ) in fepd films and was found to be consistent with the predictions .",
    "levy and zhang ( 1997 ) obtained a domain - wall resistivity proportional to @xmath357 , where @xmath358 denotes the domain - wall width .",
    "van hoof ( 1999 ) and brataas ( 1999b ) calculated the domain - wall resistivity in ni , fe and co due to spin - flip scattering both within a two - band model and using a realistic band - structure . within the two - band model these authors recovered levy and",
    "zhang s ( 1997 ) result of a domain - wall resistivity proportional to @xmath357 .",
    "the first - principles calculation including a realistic bandstructure , however , yielded a considerably larger domain - wall magnetoresistance inversely proportional to @xmath358 in contrast to the two - band result .",
    "on the other hand , tatara and fukuyama ( 1997 ) and lyanda - geller ( 1998 ) pointed out that domain walls might contribute to the de - coherence of electrons , thus leading to a resistivity decrease due to the suppression of weak localization effects .",
    "although this is in qualitative agreement with the results of kent ( 1999 ) and taniyama ( 1999 ) , kent ( 1999 ) pointed out that the negative mr contribution persists to much higher temperatures than expected for quantum interference effects .",
    "indeed , rdiger ( 1998a ) estimated the maximum temperature for the observation of weak localization effects by equating the wall de - coherence time to the inelastic scattering time and found a value of 7  k being an order of magnitude lower than observed .",
    "finally , based on the observation that the negative domain - wall contribution vanishes for large film thicknesses , rdiger ( 1999b ) argued that surface scattering might be important ; in their model the negative magnetoresistance arises from the deflection of charge carriers away from the surface that is being mediated by the presence of domain walls .",
    "a recent calculation by van gorkom ( 1999a ) showed that a negative domain - wall resistance can also arise from the reduced magnetization in a domain wall , if the ratio of the spin - dependent relaxation times is appropriate .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "the drude resistivity of a single domain ferromagnet is given within the two - band stoner model by ( van gorkom 1999a ) @xmath359 where @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) denote the majority ( minority ) density of states and @xmath360 ( @xmath361 ) the relaxation time for majority ( minority ) electrons .",
    "a redistribution of the electrons in a domain wall with @xmath362 , @xmath363 modifies the resistivity according to @xmath364 depending on the ratio of the spin - dependent relaxation times , this resistivity change can be positive or negative .",
    "van gorkom ( 1999a ) calculated @xmath365 and @xmath366 self - consistently for a semiclassical domain - wall model and indeed found a negative domain - wall resistance for @xmath367 .",
    "since the relaxation times depend on the type of impurity ( campbell and fert 1982 ) , this model can be experimentally checked by measuring the domain - wall resistivities of a series of alloys .    despite the experimental and theoretical debate on the relation between domain - wall magnetoresistance and domain - wall width",
    ", it is generally accepted that a significant magnetoresistance will only arise in the case of a narrow wall .",
    "it is therefore promising to investigate nanocontacts with geometrically constrained domain walls .",
    "indeed , bruno ( 1999 ) showed that the domain - wall width of such a geometrically constrained wall is of the order of the width of the constriction .",
    "garca ( 1999 ) investigated the magnetoresistance of ni nanocontacts and found values of up to 75% ( with respect to the zero field value ) at room temperature for contacts with a conductance of only a few conductance units @xmath368 .",
    "this was explained by tatara ( 1999 ) by scattering at a narrow domain wall located at the nanocontact .",
    "the agreement between theory and experimental values , however , is only qualitative ( tatara 1999 ) ; the theory shows that the magnetoresistance is enhanced at small contact sizes corresponding to conductances of only a few conductance units .",
    "a similar experiment was performed by wegrowe ( 2000 ) .",
    "these authors investigated the magnetoresistance of co nanowires exchange biased by a gdco@xmath369 layer . in this configuration",
    ", a domain wall is expected to form at the interface and to be compressed by an applied magnetic field .",
    "wegrowe ( 2000 ) observed a strong decrease of the domain - wall resistance as a function of the domain - wall width in the range 5  nm to 10  nm .",
    "the limited range of domain - wall thicknesses accessible in this experiment did not allow to distinguish between the various predictions for the domain - wall width dependence .",
    "the resistance contribution of partial domain walls located on either side of permalloy / permalloy , co / permalloy , co / co , ni / ni and co / cu point contacts was found to be negative ( van gorkom 1999b , theeuwen 2001 ) .",
    "following the theoretical results of van gorkom ( 1999a ) this could be interpreted as arising from boundary scattering in combination with an appropriate ratio of the spin dependent relaxation times .      within the double - exchange model , the transfer integral @xmath191 for the e@xmath124 electrons depends sensitively on the angle @xmath192 between the core spins of the adjacent mn@xmath105 and mn@xmath23 sites .",
    "therefore , it is expected that a narrow domain wall has a considerable influence on the conductance of the manganites .",
    "the scattering by domain walls in double - exchange ferromagnets was treated by zhang and yang ( 1996 ) , yamanaka and nagaosa ( 1996 ) , gehring ( 1997 ) and brey ( 1999 ) . whereas zhang and yang ( 1996 ) calculated the temperature and field dependence of the resistivity due to the temperature and field dependence of the average domain size , yamanaka and nagaosa ( 1996 ) , as well as gehring ( 1997 ) , calculated the conductance of a single domain wall as a function of the domain - wall width @xmath358 .",

    "thus , depending on the wave vector of the electrons incident under an angle @xmath143 with respect to the wall normal ,    1 .",
    "the electrons will be scattered regardless of incoming angle @xmath143 , if @xmath374 , 2 .",

    "gehring ( 1997 ) estimated @xmath380 such that case ( ii ) is likely to apply .",
    "thus , electrons incident under an angle @xmath381 with @xmath382 , will be scattered through an angle @xmath383 giving a contribution to the resistivity proportional to @xmath384 = 2k_f\\cos^2(\\phi)$ ] , whereas electrons incident at smaller angles pass the wall nearly undisturbed .",

    "mathur ( 1999 ) measured the resistivity of a patterned lcmo track .",
    "this track had narrow constrictions separating regions with wider linewidth ( `` bellies '' ) ; small permanent magnets were placed near every second belly .",
    "after magnetizing to saturation in an in - plane field , the magnetic field was slowly reversed ; the unbiased `` belly '' regions are believed to reverse the magnetization at small negative fields , thus creating domain walls near the constrictions .",
    "mathur ( 1999 ) report a step - like behaviour of the resistivity hysteresis below about 130  k. this was attributed to the switching of individual `` belly '' regions and , accordingly , to the creation of single domain walls .",
    "the areal resistivity was found to be large about @xmath395  @xmath396m@xmath397 at 77  k. mathur ( 1999 ) estimated an areal domain - wall resistivity of @xmath398  @xmath396m@xmath397 within a born approximation . using @xmath399 with @xmath400  @xmath116 cm ,",
    "a domain - wall width @xmath401  nm and @xmath402 according to equation  ( [ yamanaka3 ] ) yields an even smaller value of about @xmath403  @xmath396m@xmath397 .",
    "this discrepancy might indicate some internal structure of the domain walls ( mathur 1999 ) .",
    "wu ( 1999 ) and suzuki ( 2000 ) investigated the magnetoresistance of compressively strained lsmo films on laalo@xmath26 .",
    "these films have a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy leading to the formation of perpendicular magnetic domains on a scale of about 200  nm . if the magnetoresistance is measured after sweeping an in - plane or an out - of - plane field perpendicular to the current , the resistivity should return to the same value in zero field apart from domain - wall scattering effects due to the different domain configurations .",
    "the measurement on a 80  nm lsmo film at 300  k yielded a deviation of about 0.1% in the two field configurations .",
    "this corresponds to a domain - wall areal resistivity of @xmath404  @xmath396m@xmath397 .",
    "this value is significantly smaller than the value obtained by mathur ( 1999 ) , possibly due to the higher measurement temperature .",
    "the calculation of brey ( 1999 ) yielded an areal resistivity of @xmath405  @xmath396m@xmath397 smaller than the value observed by mathur ( 1999 ) , but close to the value found by wu ( 1999 ) .",
    "this shows that the precision of the experimental values is not sufficient at the moment in order to test different theories .",
    "ziese ( 1999b ) determined the domain - wall width in various lcmo films , i.e.  a polycrystalline film on si ( 200  nm ) , an as - deposited film on laalo@xmath26 ( 120  nm ) and an annealed film on laalo@xmath26 ( 9  nm ) using magnetic viscosity measurements .",
    "the magnetic viscosity @xmath406 is related to the average activation volume @xmath407 by @xmath408 where @xmath409 denotes the saturation magnetization and @xmath410 the irreversible susceptibility . from measurements of @xmath248 , @xmath409 and @xmath410 the average activation volume can be determined .",

    "ziese ( 1999b ) found that the domain - wall thickness did not significantly depend on the microstructure , see figure  [ domain ] .",
    "this is surprising , since it was believed that domain walls located near grain boundaries were relatively narrow due to the weakened double - exchange coupling near the defect . gehring ( 1997 )",
    "speculated that the large low field magnetoresistance observed in polycrystalline materials is due to electron scattering by narrow domain walls near the grain boundaries .",
    "experimentally , this idea could not be confirmed , since the magnetoresistance of the epitaxial and polycrystalline films investigated by ziese ( 1999b ) varied by one order of magnitude , whereas the measured domain - wall thickness was identical .",

    "the magnetization of the film was technically saturated and the stripe domains had been driven out of the film ; the stripe domain pattern was not recovered after removal of the magnetic field , implying that the irreversible resistivity drop was related to this particular domain structure .",

    "moreover , a significant surface segregation was found with the ca content being strongly enhanced near the surface ; this was also found to depend on doping with a surface ca fraction of 0.9 for @xmath423 and 0.6 for @xmath424 .",
    "the authors conclude that the surface could be fundamentally different from the bulk and that any measurement of bulk properties using surface sensitive techniques such as angle - resolved photoemission has to be treated with care .",

    "the conductance decreases at large bias voltages , presumably due to heating effects .",
    "the voltage dependence of the differential conductance at low temperatures does not depend on the applied magnetic field for fields up to 12  t. the conductance dip was interpreted as being due to andreev reflection at a clean ferromagnetic / superconducting interface . since lbmo has a high spin - polarization ,",
    "andreev reflection is suppressed .",
    "the disappearance of the conductance dip at about 60  k might indicate that the superconductor is in the orthorombic ii phase near the interface .",

    "the magnetoresistance of the junction in ( c ) reaches about 200% , whereas the larger junction in ( b ) has a magnetoresistance of only 20% .",
    "very large values of 870% ( sun 1998 ) and 450% ( viret 1997a ) have been reported at low temperatures",
    ". however , the junction characteristics are not reproducible .",
    "several groups have investigated the tmr ratio as a function of temperature .",
    "lu ( 1996 ) reported a strong decrease of the magnetoresistance with temperature in lsmo / sto / lsmo junctions ; the tmr ratio is found to vanish above about 200  k , whereas the curie temperature of the electrodes is much higher with @xmath537  k. obata ( 1999 ) report tmr values extending up to the curie temperature in lsmo / sto / lsmo junctions with very smooth interfaces and thin sto barriers with thickness of 1.6  nm , see figure  [ obata1 ] .",
    "yin ( 2000 ) obtained a similar result in lsmo / la@xmath538sr@xmath539mno@xmath26/lsmo junctions .",
    "however , even in this case the tmr ratio decreases much faster with temperature than the bulk magnetization .",
    "this behaviour might not be surprising , since the spin - polarization is controlled by the interfacial magnetization that shows a much stronger decay with temperature than the bulk magnetization .",
    "indeed , as discussed in section  [ lcmometal ] , measurements of the surface spin - polarization by park ( 1998a ) indicate that the surface spin - polarization is strongly reduced in comparison to the bulk magnetization in qualitative agreement with the tunnelling magnetoresistance .",
    "the strong temperature dependence , however , might to some extent still be of extrinsic origin related to non - stoichiometry of the interface region and interface roughness .",
    "viret ( 1997a ) observed a maximum in the tunnelling resistance for parallel magnetization at about 200  k. in view of the dependence of the curie temperature on oxygen content , this might be interpreted as due to an oxygen deficient lsmo layer near the interface .",
    "this is corroborated by the results of gilabert ( 2001 ) who observed a strong photoconductivity in a la@xmath540mno@xmath26/al@xmath2o@xmath26/nb junction below 95  k. this finding was interpreted as arising from photoinduced charge - carrier generation in an oxygen - depleted region near the interface , thus effectively reducing the tunnelling barrier thickness .",
    "sun ( 1997 ) found indications of variable range hopping in the junction resistance above about 130  k , where the tmr vanishes , see figure  [ sun3 ] .",
    "this was interpreted as indicating a high defect density in the srtio@xmath26 barrier leading to defect - state mediated tunnelling through the barrier at higher temperatures .",
    "fits of the simmons model to the non - linear conductance yield small tunnelling barriers with values 0.5 - 0.7  ev ( sun 1997 ) and 0.1 - 0.2  ev ( obata 1999 ) .",
    "these are much smaller than the srtio@xmath26 band gap of about 3  ev and also indicate the presence of defect states .",
    "sun ( 1998 ) reported a zero bias dip in the conductance for temperatures below 130  k and bias voltages below 200  mev .",
    "since this zero bias dip was also present in lsmo / al@xmath2o@xmath26/permalloy junctions , it was related to the properties of the lsmo bottom electrode .",
    "sun ( 1998 ) suggested this feature to arise from a coulomb gap effect due to metallic inclusions of approximate size 1.5  nm at the interface .",
    "the nature of the metallic inclusions is unknown ; it was speculated that these are related to the localization length of the spin - polarized carriers .",
    "moreover , the different switching fields of the electrodes are only induced by shape anisotropy .",

    "the agreement is remarkable .",

    "however , the effective spin - polarization in these junctions does also strongly decrease with temperature and was seen to vanish above 150  k. as in the data of sun ( 1997 ) the junction resistivity indicates an activated non - tunnelling conductance .",
    "moon - ho jo ( 2000a ) , however , argue that this is insufficient to explain the drastic decrease in tunnelling magnetoresistance above 120  k. they propose a model based on percolative phase separation at the interface : within this model the decrease of the spin - polarization is caused by the growth of paramagnetic regions nucleated near interface defects at the expense of ferromagnetic regions .",
    "this model is consistent with the mesoscopic results of fth ( 1999 ) , see section  [ optical ] .",
    "direct evidence for phase separation near @xmath545/srtio@xmath26 interfaces has been obtained from a nmr study as a function of thickness , 6  nm @xmath546 108  nm of the manganite layer ( bibes 2001 ) .",

    "the resistivity along the c - axis displays insulating behaviour above the magnetic ordering temperature . perring ( 1998 ) performed a neutron scattering study on single crystals with dopings @xmath594 in order to determine the magnetic structure .",
    "whereas the @xmath593 compound appears to be ferromagnetically ordered below 121  k , the @xmath170 compound was found to order ferromagnetically in the ab - planes with these ferromagnetic sheets stacked antiferromagnetically along the c - axis .",
    "a magnetic field of 1.5  t applied parallel to the ab - planes was found to switch the magnetic order from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic .",
    "simultaneous measurements of the antiferromagnetic superstructure peaks and the c - axis magnetoresistance revealed a similar field dependence ; the magnetoresistance saturates , when the antiferromagnetic order is destroyed , see figure  [ perring98 ] .",
    "perring ( 1998 ) argued that the semiconducting behaviour of the c - axis resistivity above the magnetic ordering temperature indicates the insulating nature of the @xmath595 spacing layers .",
    "the mno layers are metallic ferromagnets due to the double - exchange interaction .",
    "accordingly , the layered manganites can be viewed as an intrinsic stack of tunnelling junctions such as @xmath596 single crystals are stacks of intrinsic joesphson junctions . at 4",

    "neglecting shunting currents , the spin - polarization can be calculated from the magnetoresistance ratio within julliere s model , equation  ( [ tunresist ] ) , yielding @xmath598 .",
    "as already discussed in section  [ optical ] , the double exchange mechanism is extraordinarily sensitive to distortions of the mn  o  mn bond .",
    "this leads to the formation of insulating regions in the strain fields of extended defects such as grain boundaries .",
    "therefore , polycrystalline manganite samples do actually behave as granular metals , although the variation in stoichiometry across grain boundaries is likely to be negligible .",
    "an unexpectedly large low field magnetoresistance was discovered in polycrystalline manganite bulk and thin film samples ( hwang 1996 , gupta 1996 ) .",
    "this finding initiated numerous studies on extrinsic magnetoresistance effects in magnetic oxides ; investigations were extended to other systems such as cro@xmath2 , @xmath13 , the double perovskite @xmath4 as well as srruo@xmath26 .",
    "the characteristics of the extrinsic magnetoresistance in these materials will be compared at the end of this section .",
    "the bulk of the experimental data , however , is related to the manganites .      with few exceptions , models for grain - boundary magnetoresistance",
    "are based on spin - polarized tunnelling .",
    "this implies that the grain boundary strongly hinders charge transport leading to the formation of an insulating region ; simultaneously the adjacent grains are only weakly magnetically coupled across this interfacial region .",
    "thus , polycrystalline manganite samples are similar to granular ferromagnetic metals ; at this point a brief review of the properties of granular metals seems appropriate .",
    "a typical granular metal consists of small grains surrounded by insulating material .",
    "usually the values of both grain diameter @xmath27 as well as grain separation @xmath147 follow a broad distribution .",
    "carrier transport involves charging of grains that costs a charging energy @xmath599 , where @xmath600 denotes the vacuum permittivity and the function @xmath601 depends on grain shape .",
    "the conductivity is proportional to the tunnelling matrix element @xmath602 $ ] with @xmath603 ( simmons 1963 ) and the population of a single grain @xmath604 $ ] ; these terms determine the essential temperature dependence of the conductivity .",

    "the metal grains are formed by diffusion of metal atoms or clusters and , for a given composition , there exists a definite relationship between grain diameter @xmath27 and grain separation @xmath147 such that @xmath606 is constant ( sheng 1973 ) .",

    "it is surprising , however , that the spin polarization @xmath36 appears linearly in the expression for the magnetoresistance .",
    "thus , the magnetoresistance should be positive for fe and negative for ni grains which is not seen experimentally .",
    "there seems to be some inconsistency in the work of helman and abeles ( 1976 ) in that it relates the spin dependence of the hopping probability to one grain , whereas the magnetic energy is an intergrain property .",
    "this issue is somehow resolved by wagner ( 1998 ) within a different context , namely hopping between spin polarons in single crystalline material .",

    "it is reasonable that two mechanisms contribute to the conductivity , namely tunnelling through the barrier and thermal hopping over the barrier ; these lead to two contributions to the magnetoresistance , a temperature independent one due to tunnelling and a temperature dependent one due to hopping .",
    "a systematic investigation of these effects , however , has not yet been carried out .",
    "data on the magnetoresistance of granular metals , see e.g.  mitani ( 1997 ) , honda ( 1997 ) , show that the magnetoresistance in granular metals is often independent of or weakly dependent on temperature . this lead inoue and maekawa ( 1996 ) to contest equation  ( [ granular4 ] ) and propose another mechanism for the magnetoresistance in granular materials .",
    "since the tunnelling probability depends on the relative directions of the grain magnetizations , see equation  ( [ slonc1 ] ) , the field dependence of the conductivity arises mainly from the pre - exponential factor , @xmath620 . averaging over @xmath192 and the grain separation @xmath147 yields a temperature dependence of the conductivity as in equation  ( [ granular2 ] ) and a magnetoconductivity @xmath621 with @xmath622 .",

    "equation  ( [ gpoly ] ) was derived under the assumption that the grains within a specific percolation path are connected in parallel . in reality",
    "a granular material is a complicated conduction network . in the case of a narrow distribution of grain separations as it might occur in polycrystalline films with tunnelling barriers defined by grain boundaries , a multitude of conduction paths contribute to the global resistance .",
    "this can be approximated by a resistor network .",

    "the main experimental data are summarized in this section .",
    "typical polycrystalline manganite samples have grain sizes in the range 100  nm ... 10  @xmath265 m being too large for charging effects to dominate .",
    "therefore , the temperature dependence of the resistivity does not follow equation  ( [ granular2 ] ) , but is rather determined by the specific transport mechanisms in the barrier . moreover ,",
    "the grains are coupled ferromagnetically .",
    "a systematic study of the magnetotransport and magnetic properties of @xmath638 ceramics was reported by balcells ( 2000 ) . at small grain sizes below about 40  nm charging effects become significant . the charging energy was found to be reciprocal to the grain diameter as expected .",

    "the intergranular magnetoresistance to be discussed in the following sections involves effects beyond this classical model ; within the discussion a theoretical description will evolve .",
    "the effects of grain boundaries on the resistivity and magnetoresistance of polycrystalline manganite compounds were reported very early ( volger 1953 , van den brom and volger 1967 ) .",

    "these results can not be explained by the intrinsic magnetoresistance alone , since the intrinsic magnetoresistance is only a function of the magnetization .",
    "hwang ( 1996 ) suggested that the low field magnetoresistance in polycrystalline samples is due to spin - polarized tunnelling between misaligned grains .",
    "it was shown by wang ( 1998 ) that , phenomenologically , one has to distinguish weak and strong links between the grains .",
    "only weak links give rise to a considerable low field magnetoresistance .",

    "it might be concluded that tunnelling between ferromagnetic grains occurs mainly via one or two localized states .",
    "this qualitatively explains the experimentally observed reduction of the magnetoresistance in comparison to julliere s model , since a spin - polarization loss results during the inelastic tunnelling process .",
    "this idea was further developed by hfener ( 2000 ) : the bi - crystal magnetoresistance was observed to decrease drastically with increasing voltage bias , since the junction is shunted by inelastic tunnelling processes that do not conserve the spin .",
    "hfener ( 2000 ) proposed an extension of julliere s model to a three - current model by taking inelastic tunnelling into account ; this is the same approach used by zhang and white ( 1998 ) .",
    "this leads to a voltage dependent magnetoresistance @xmath673 here @xmath674 denotes the current due to inelastic tunnelling and @xmath535 the current through the junction in the antiparallel magnetization state due to direct tunnelling .",
    "independent measurements of the voltage dependent magnetoresistance and the elastic to inelastic current ratio showed significant correlation , thus corroborating the importance of inelastic tunnelling processes .",
    "lee ( 1999 ) argued that spin - polarized tunnelling in manganite ceramics proceeds mainly via one localized state . within this model",

    "the magnetoresistance , as well as the magnetoconductance , are linear at high fields .",
    "however , lee ( 1999 ) showed that the magnetoconductance of manganite polycrystals is linear in magnetic field to a very good approximation .",
    "it is generally argued that the high field slope @xmath679 is proportional to the grain - boundary susceptibility @xmath678 ( guinea 1998 , evetts 1998 , ziese 1999 , lee 1999 ) . here",

    "such a relationship was derived by guinea ( 1998 ) within a model including tunnelling via paramagnetic impurities which leads to a high field slope being proportional to the curie susceptibility .",
    "however , the temperature dependence of @xmath678 , see figure  [ chigb ] for data on various manganite samples , indicates some magnetic ordering of the grain - boundary region .",
    "moreover , the high field magnetoresistance slope extends to very high fields @xmath682  t , whereas a paramagnetic grain - boundary region containing mn@xmath23-ions is expected to saturate at about 1  t at 4.2 k. some evidence for the magnetic state of the grain - boundary region comes from the work of fontcuberta ( fontcuberta 1998 , balcells 1998a , 1998b , martnez 1998 ) , ziese ( ziese 1998b , ziese 1999a , ziese 1999 ) , zhang ( 1997 ) and zhu ( zhu 2001 ) .",
    "fontcuberta studied lsmo ceramics with various grain sizes and observed an increase of the thickness of the tunnelling barrier as well as a reduction of the saturation magnetization with decreasing grain size .",
    "this indicates that the surface layer of the grains is in a magnetically disordered state .",
    "this magnetically frustrated interface region is presumably insulating and serves as the tunnelling barrier between the ferromagnetic grains .",
    "this interpretation is corroborated by studies of various rare - earth substitutions on the magnetotransport properties ( fontcuberta 1998 , zhou 1999 ) .",
    "there seem to be ideal cation substitutions maximizing the low field magnetoresistance .",
    "this might be related to enhanced spin disorder induced by the competition of double exchange and super - exchange interactions .",
    "zhang ( 1997 ) related the tunnelling barrier to the energy difference between the bulk and surface double - exchange sytems . within this approach resistivity versus temperature curves could be successfully modelled .",
    "zhu ( 2001 ) directly observed a spin - freezing transition in lsmo nanoparticles with a mean grain size below 50  nm : at temperatures below 45  k the field cooled magnetization suddenly increases .",
    "this transition indicates the alignment of the surface magnetic moments with the moments in the nanoparticle core .",
    "ziese investigated the grain - boundary magnetoresistance as a function of angle between the applied field and the current and found typical anisotropic magnetoresistance ( see also coey 1999 ) of the same order of magnitude as in epitaxial films ( ziese 1999a , ziese 1999 ) .",
    "this was interpreted by ziese ( 1999 ) to indicate tunnelling via manganese ions in the barrier , since the anisotropic magnetoresistance is mainly determined by the local environment of the magnetic ion , see section  [ intrinsic ] .",
    "it is therefore likely that electrons tunnel between different grains via magnetically coupled , frustrated manganese ions in the grain - boundary region . since this region has a negligible volume compared to the rest of the film , a direct magnetic investigation has not been possible so far .",
    "however , indirect information on the magnetic state of the grain boundary stems from resistance relaxation experiments ( ziese 1998b ) . in these experiments",
    "the resistance relaxation of various manganite samples was measured after a field step from 1  t to the remanence field of the magnet of about 7  mt .",
    "the relaxation was found to be logarithmic in time , see figure  [ relax]a .",
    "the relaxation rate @xmath683 scales with the low field magnetoresistance , see figure  [ relax]b proving that the relaxation is due to magnetization processes in the grain - boundary region .",
    "this was corroborated by measurements of the magnetic viscosity of a polycrystalline lcmo film on si ( ziese 1999b ) .",
    "the resistance relaxation expected from magnetic viscosity of the grains is one order of magnitude smaller than the resistance relaxation due to the barrier spins .",
    "the logarithmic time decay indicates a frustrated magnetic state of the barrier spins .",
    "calculations of the surface structure of double - exchange ferromagnets indicate an antiferromagnetic ordering ( calderon 1999b ) . assuming an antiferromagnetically ordered interface between two ferromagnetic grains , calderon ( 1999b ) calculated the high field magnetoresistance and found a linear resistivity decrease in agreement with experiment .",
    "however , it might be argued that the linear high field magnetoresistance is a signature of any frustrated spin structure in the barrier , since it arises from the action of the applied field against the exchange field .",

    "the grain boundary magnetization vanishes above 370  k. adapted from soh ( 2001).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the magnetic properties of the grain boundary play a central role in the understanding of the magnetotransport properties in polycrystalline manganites .",
    "local magnetic information has been obtained by magneto - optical imaging ( miller 2000 ) and magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) ( soh 2000 , 2001 ) of bi - crystal junctions .",
    "miller ( 2000 ) detected a reorientation of the grain - boundary magnetization pointing out - of - plane , whereas the grain magnetization lies in plane .",
    "this magnetization rotation might contribute to the low field magnetoresistance .",
    "more astonishing are the results of mfm studies on the temperature dependence of the grain - boundary magnetization : this was found to have a higher curie temperature than bulk material ( soh 2000 , 2001 ) ! figure  [ mfm ] shows mfm - scans near a grain boundary grown on a bi - crystal substrate at temperatures between 300  k and 365  k. at 300  k a domain - wall located at the grain boundary is seen . above the bulk curie temperature of 300",
    "k the grain magnetization vanishes ; a clear magnetic signal is recorded , however , at 355  k , localized near the grain boundary . this magnetic state is also found near natural defects .",
    "it vanishes above 370  k. from these studies it follows that the grain - boundary region is magnetically ordered ; moreover , the size of this mesoscale magnetic region varies with temperature and the nature of the underlying defect .",
    "this provides additional evidence for the mechanism of tunnelling through a magnetic barrier .",
    "the temperature dependence of the grain - boundary resistance is not very well understood . in all samples",
    "a broad resistance maximum is seen well below the curie temperature . at low temperatures @xmath684",
    "k , a resistance upturn is observed .",
    "phenomenologically , such a temperature dependence can be reproduced by considering a model of parallel conduction channels ( de andrs 1999 ) . since the resistivity is dominated by the least resistive paths , parallel conduction through well linked grains and intergranular regions can be considered .",
    "in such a model , the intergranular regions are assumed to be semiconducting , whereas the grains are metallic . introducing effective cross sections for both channels , a satisfactory fit to the data",
    "can be made ( de andrs 1999 ) .",
    "this model , however , is not fully satisfying , since it does not provide information on the microscopic transport mechanism .",
    "ziese and srinitiwarawong ( 1998 ) showed that the resistivity of polycrystalline lcmo and lbmo films above the curie temperature followed a variable range hopping law @xmath685 , wheras epitaxial films are better described by polaron transport in the adiabatic limit , @xmath686 .",
    "this result is consistent with the idea of intergranular transport via impurities .",
    "balcells ( 1998b ) found a @xmath687 $ ] variation of the resistivity of ceramic lsmo samples at low temperature and interpreted this behaviour as arising from a coulomb gap .",
    "in contrast to this result , raychaudhuri ( 1999 ) observed variable range hopping at low temperatures in polycrystalline lsmo .",
    "the broad resistance maximum at intermediate temperatures might be an indication of a mainly antiferromagnetic spin structure at the interface .",
    "the ubiquitous resistance minimum at low temperatures was interpreted by rozenberg ( 2000 ) as due to the thermal disordering of a mainly antiferromagnetically aligned spin structure .    in conclusion , a consensus seems to emerge on the nature of spin - polarized transport in polycrystalline magnetic oxides .",
    "it was realized that charge - carrier transport occurs via inelastic tunnelling processes .",
    "this implies that the magnetotransport depends strongly on the barrier characteristics .",
    "the grain - boundary region shows magnetic order , presumably a frustrated magnetic state or a mainly antiferromagnetic state with some frustration , causing an approximately linear high field magnetoresistance extending to very large fields .",
    "the inelastic tunnelling process is detrimental to the low field magnetoresistance , since the spin - polarization is reduced during the transit through the magnetically disordered barrier .",
    "this is confirmed by calculations of the apparent spin - polarization of ferromagnetic tunnelling junctions with a disordered barrier ( tsymbal and pettifor 1998 ) .",
    "the great future challenge is to produce grain - boundary junctions with non - magnetic or magnetically ordered tunnelling barriers in order to improve the effective spin - polarization .",
    "annealed bi - crystal junctions seem to be promising candidates for such a development ( steenbeck 1998 )",
    ".        apart from the low field magnetoresistance studies of manganite ceramics discussed above , the extrinsic magnetoresistance of polycrystalline material of cro@xmath2 ( hwang and cheong 1997a , coey 1998a , manoharan 1998 , dai 2000 , dai and tang 2000a , 2000b ) , @xmath13 ( hwang and cheong 1997b ) , @xmath4 ( kim 1999 , yuan 1999 ) and @xmath688 ( drr 1999 ) was studied .",
    "these investigations usually show a large low field magnetoresistance between about 20% and 60% at low temperature .",

    "typical data of a @xmath4 polycrystal are shown in figure  [ kim]a .",
    "the temperature dependence of the tunnelling magnetoresistance , however , varies strongly among these compounds .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ kim]b comparing the normalized low field magnetoresistance as a function of the reduced temperature , @xmath689 , for cro@xmath2 , @xmath638 , @xmath141 and @xmath4 .",
    "a clear trend emerges : the decay of the tunnelling magnetoresistance with temperature becomes smaller along this series .",
    "this was corroborated by lee ( 1999 ) .",
    "for @xmath108 the magnetoresistance is proportional to @xmath690 as expected for spin - polarized tunnelling .",
    "the interpretation of these data is not fully clear .",
    "the different temperature dependences seem to be related to both the interfacial magnetism and the tunnelling barrier properties .",
    "one might speculate that @xmath4 has the most robust interfacial magnetization of the four compounds compared . at the same time",
    "the tunnelling barrier might contain less magnetically active localized states . on a microscopic scale",
    "the distinction between grains and barrier might not be suitable , since the transition between those is supposed to be gradual .",
    "the spin structure of the itinerant and super - exchange ferromagnets @xmath4 and @xmath13 might be less sensitive to structural disorder than in the double exchange systems @xmath638 and cro@xmath2 , since the latter show a competition between ferromagnetic double exchange and antiferromagnetic super - exchange .",
    "the double exchange mechanism is supposed to be weakenend near an interface due to the reduced carrier mobility .",
    "scanning tunnelling microscopic and spectroscopic investigations on manganite polycrystals indicated a semiconducting nature of the intergranular layers with a band gap of 0.3 - 0.45  ev ; there might also be some band bending in the adjacent grains ( kar 1998 ) .",

    "it has , however , been notoriously difficult to obtain a significant extrinsic magnetoresistance even at low temperatures , see the studies by coey ( 1998a ) , ziese ( 1998b ) , li ( 1998a ) , nishimura ( 2000 ) , kitamoto ( 2000 ) , chen and du ( 2000 ) , uotani ( 2000 ) and taniyama ( 2001 ) .",

    "precipitates form between grains ; these appear to be good tunnelling barriers minimizing spin - polarization loss near the grain - boundary as well as inelastic tunnelling effects .",
    "the spin - polarization vanishes sharply at the curie temperature of 318  k. if the interpretation of the large magnetoresistance due to spin - polarized tunnelling is correct , this work opens the way to efficiently engineer room temperature devices based on magnetite .",
    "some investigations focused on the controlled fabrication of grain boundaries in other ferro- and ferrimagnetic oxides .",
    "this research was driven by the realization that the strong magnetoresistance decay as a function of temperature observed in the manganites and in cro@xmath2 precluded room temperature applications .",
    "possible remedies are magnetic oxides with a high curie temperature or with a robust interfacial spin structure as indicated by the encouraging results on polycrystalline material .",
    "grain - boundary junctions introduced in srruo@xmath26 films ( bibes 1999b ) , @xmath4 films ( yin 1999 ) and @xmath3 films ( ziese 1998b ) were investigated .",
    "all these experiments showed only a small extrinsic magnetoresistance .",
    "24@xmath127 bi - crystal junctions had no effect on the magnetoresistance of srruo@xmath26 films , whereas laser - patterned junctions enhanced the high field magnetoresistance , but did not induce a low field magnetoresistance characteristic of spin - polarized tunnelling ( bibes 1999b ) .",
    "24@xmath127 bi - crystal junctions in @xmath4 films showed a small magnetoresistance of about 2% at 2  kg and 20  k , twice the value of the magnetoresistance of a virgin film ( yin 1999 ) .",
    "ziese ( 1998b ) did not observe any significant enhancement of the magnetoresistance of @xmath3 `` scratch '' junctions compared to epitaxial films .",
    "this is consistent with the small extrinsic magnetoresistance in @xmath3 polycrystalline films and pressed powders ( coey 1998a ) .",
    "it has to be noted , however , that magnetite films show a high field extrinsic magnetoresistance due to antiphase boundaries ( ziese and blythe 2000 ) that might mask any contribution from artificially introduced defects .    in conclusion , these results indicate that the large low field magnetoresistance observed in manganite bi - crystal junctions might be specific to this double - exchange system .",
    "it seems that it is much more difficult to introduce insulating regions in the itinerant ferromagnets srruo@xmath26 , @xmath4 and the ferrimagnet @xmath3 and thus to decouple the magnetic electrodes .",
    "this , apart from the lower spin - polarization in srruo@xmath26 , seems to be the limiting factor in the device performance of those junctions .",
    "one might state this conclusion in another way : the instability of the interfacial spin structure of the manganites toward antiferromagnetic ordering or magnetic frustration is a pre - requisite to readily fabricate grain - boundary junctions .",
    "the large low field magnetoresistance observed in polycrystalline samples does not contradict this conclusion , since strong magnetic disorder is often induced in small particles .",
    "disordered magnetism at grain boundaries was also reported for pure nanocrystalline iron ( bonetti 1999 ) .",
    "in this work extrinsic magnetoresistance phenomena in magnetic oxides were reviewed . besides domain - wall scattering ,",
    "the most important effects are spin - polarized tunnelling in ferromagnetic junctions and grain - boundary magnetoresistance .",
    "one indicator for the potential of a magnetic material in tunnelling structures is the degree of spin - polarization . here",
    "the magnetic oxides are almost unique is having spin - polarizations approaching 100% .",
    "great progress has been made in recent years in both the fabrication of tunnelling junctions and the understanding of the transport mechanisms in grain - boundary junctions .",
    "a huge magnetoresistance was seen in @xmath694 tunnelling junctions at @xmath695  k in agreement with the large spin - polarization .",
    "the magnetoresistance ratio , however , decays strongly with increasing temperature rendering these junctions useless for room - temperature applications .",
    "this strong decay appears to be related to a reduced interfacial spin - polarization . at present , it is not clear whether this is mainly an intrinsic effect related to surface reconstruction or is more a problem of producing high quality atomically flat interfaces .",
    "a similar problem was found in grain - boundary junctions . here , insulating connections between different crystallites in polycrystalline material are formed leading to spin - polarized tunnelling between ferromagnetic grains .",
    "this process is very similar to the tunnelling process in ferromagnetic tunnelling junctions . the insulating layer between the grains , however , has many defect states leading to inelastic tunnelling processes and an apparent spin - polarization decrease .    there are some indications that domain - wall scattering might be important in magnetic oxides . a rigorous experimental proof including a precise measurement of its magnitude , however , has not yet been given .",
    "the use of nano - constricted domain walls certainly opens the most promising perspectives for further research .    in summary",
    ", the physics of spin - polarized transport in both ferromagnetic tunnel junctions and grain - boundary junctions has led to great challenges to both theoretical as well as experimental physics and many interesting discoveries have been made .",
    "the initial aim of fabricating magnetic field sensors operating at room temperature , however , has not yet been achieved .",
    "this is in part due to the sensitive surface chemistry of the materials and furthermore due to the relatively low curie temperatures . here ,",
    "the investigation of @xmath14 that has a @xmath9 above 400  k and a seemingly robust interfacial magnetization might lead to a breakthrough .",
    "magnetite has a high curie temperature , but has not been successfully used as electrode material for tunnelling junctions .",
    "an issue that has not been addressed in this review but that is of particular importance for applications is the noise level in magnetic oxides . in the oxides",
    "studied so far  mixed - valence manganites , cro@xmath2 and @xmath3 ( see alers 1996 , rajeswari 1996 , hardner 1997 and raquet 1999 )  a large @xmath696 noise exceeding the noise level in elemental metals by three to four orders of magnitude was found .",
    "the @xmath696 dependence can be understood within the dutta - dimon - horn model as arising from a very broad distribution of thermally activated fluctuators coupling to the resistivity ( dutta 1979 ) .",
    "this , however , is a very formal treatment analogous to the analysis of magnetic after - effects by a distribution of thermally activated processes or the modelling of the low temperature properties of glasses with a distribution of two - level systems .",
    "the physical nature of the processes is usually difficult to reveal .",
    "two candidates causing the large noise level in magnetic oxides are thermally activated motion of oxygen defects as well as electronic excitations of reversed spin in a nearly half - metallic band - structure .",
    "further work is clearly necessary in order to understand the noise properties of magnetic oxides and to limit their negative influence on device performance .",
    "the investigation of spin - polarized tunnelling in ferromagnetic oxides constitutes a research area within the emerging field of spin - electronics ( also called magneto - electronics , prinz 1998 ) .",
    "spin - electronics denotes a novel field of solid - state electronics that strives to realize electronic devices based on the differential manipulation of currents with well - defined spin direction .",
    "the simplest device is a magnetic field sensor and such devices have been realized on the basis of oxides working at low temperatures ( ferromagnetic tunnelling junctions ) and utilizing colossal magnetoresistance at room temperature ( thick film sensors , balcells 1996 ) or at 360  k ( bridge sensors , steinbei and steenbeck 1998 ) .",
    "there are three - terminal devices , so - called spin transistors , made from elemental ferromagnets ( johnson 1993a , 1993b ) or semiconductor / ferromagnet hybrids ( monsma 1995 ) , but such devices have not yet been realized using ferromagnetic oxides .",
    "however , since magnetic oxides are almost unique in having a half - metallic band structure , research in this direction will certainly have a huge potential .",
    "many challenging problems , e.g.  the intrinsic transport mechanism in mixed - valence manganites , the realization and investigation of double tunnelling junctions , the relation between tunnelling current and band - structure , the study of surface and interface magnetism , the investigation of bonding effects between ferromagnets and insulating barriers as well as a microscopic description of grain - boundary transport , remain and will certainly lead to the discovery of much more interesting physics .",
