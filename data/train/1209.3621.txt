    "the response of magnetic systems to time dependent external magnetic fields has been of current interest in statistical physics ( @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "magnetisation reversal dynamics is an important subject for many technological applications of magnetic materials . in magnetic recording industry",
    "fast magnetisation reversal in storage media is essential for high data transfer rate @xcite .",
    "these spin systems driven by time - dependent external magnetic fields , have basically got a competition between two time scales : the time period of the driving field and the relaxation time of the driven system , giving rise to interesting non - equilibrium phenomena .",
    "magnetisation reversal by pulsed magnetic field has been studied extensively ( @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the magnetisation reversal were studied below the corresponding static transition temperature ( @xmath0 ) , where the system remains ordered .",
    "a pulse of finite strength ( @xmath1 ) and finite duration ( @xmath2 ) , applied along the opposite direction of the prevalent order tends to reverse the magnetisation .",
    "depending on the temperature ( @xmath3 ) and pulse duration ( @xmath2 ) , there will be a critical field strength ( @xmath4 ) at which the system will be forced to change from one ordered state ( magnetisation @xmath5 ) to another ordered state ( magnetisation @xmath6 ) .",
    "below this critical strength , the magnetisation will eventually remain unchanged as the field pulse is taken off .",
    "this transition is called  magnetisation - reversal transition \" .",
    "a percolation transition is also associated with this magnetisation reversal induced by the external magnetic field . by percolation transition",
    "we mean the transition of the largest  geometrical cluster \" ( consisting of nearest neighbor parallel spins ) size from a large value to zero . in the initially ordered state ,",
    "large clusters of particular spin orientation (  up \" or  down \" ) exists .",
    "but due to the pulsed field directed along the opposite direction , the spins gradually flip ( depending on the magnitude and duration ) and for a critical value of the field or pulse duration the pre - existing large clusters vanish , giving rise to oppositely oriented clusters . thus if we measure the largest",
    " geometrical cluster \" size for a particular orientation at a certain temperature ( below the critical temperature ) and finite duration of field pulse , it shows a transition at a critical field magnitude .",
    "although thermal percolation transition of the  geometrical \" clusters , in 2d ising model has been studied extensively @xcite , very little is known about the field induced dynamical percolation transition @xcite .",
    "it was found numerically ( based on monte carlo simulation ) that for pure two dimensional ising model at finite temperature the field induced magnetisation transition and the percolation transition occur for the same critical magnetic field . moreover the critical exponents were found ( using finite size scaling analysis ) different from that of the thermal percolation transition , indicating the dynamical percolation transition to belong to a separate universality class @xcite .",
    "this transition was also studied for the 2d ising model with diagonal next nearest neighbor interaction for a typical value of the frustration parameter @xcite and it was found that the critical exponents remain unchanged .    here we intend to study the field induced percolation transition for the 2d axial next nearest neighbour ising ( annni ) model which is one of the simplest classical ising model with a tunable frustration and has been studied for a long time ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "the 2d annni model is a square lattice ising model with nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic interaction along both the axial directions and second - neighbor anti - ferromagnetic interaction along one axial direction .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath7\\ ] ] where the sites ( @xmath8,@xmath9 ) run over a square lattice , the spins @xmath10 have binary states ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 is the nearest - neighbor interaction strength and @xmath13 is a parameter of the model . for positive values of @xmath13",
    "the second - neighbor interaction introduces a competition or frustration .",
    "the @xmath14 phase diagram for this model shows a rich behavior .",
    "it is easy to prove analytically that @xcite at zero temperature , the system is in a ferromagnetic state for @xmath15 , and in antiphase ( @xmath16 along @xmath8 direction and all like spins along @xmath9 direction ) for @xmath17 with a `` multiphase '' state at @xmath18 .",
    "( the multiphase state comprises of all possible configurations that have no domain of length 1 along the @xmath8 direction . ) but the finite temperature phase diagram is yet to be solved analytically .",
    "there had been many predictions from various kinds of numerical calculations .",
    "but here we present the qualitative phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ani ] ) that has been obtained by extensive monte carlo studies @xcite . as the previously conjectured floating phase was not found in @xcite ,",
    "it has not been shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ani ] .    schematic phase diagram of the two - dimensional annni model according recent studies @xcite , width=288 ]    the phase diagram consists of ferromagnetic phase ( for @xmath15 ) and antiphase ( for @xmath17 ) at low temperature along with a paramagnetic phase at high temperature ( for all @xmath13 values ) .",
    "so for both @xmath15 and @xmath17 there is a transition temperature depending upon the value of @xmath13 . for @xmath15 , the study of percolation transition",
    "is done in a similar way as that for the unfrustrated 2d ising model .",
    "but for @xmath17 , the cluster can not be defined as we have for @xmath15 . because for @xmath17 below the static transition temperature we mainly have striped states with like spins oriented along @xmath19-axis and a periodic modulation along the direction of frustration . here",
    "we propose an alternative definition of cluster to study the percolation transition . by a cluster we mean a set of nearest neighbour spins which is in the same state as it was in its initial condition .",
    "starting from an exactly antiphase state ( initial cluster size is the system size ) we acheive a steady state at a particular temperature ( due to thermal agitation some of the spins flip and thus patches of clusters form ) .",
    "now we apply a field pulse which varies spatially along the system such that the field acts on the spin along the direction opposite to that with which it started the dynamics i.e. @xmath20 , where @xmath1 is the applied field strength at site @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the initial spin value at lattice site @xmath21 .",
    "this means that if we start with a ",
    "@xmath16 \" spin configuration along @xmath8 direction , the applied field will be along downward direction for the first two columns and upward along the next two columns and this pattern continues over the entire system . as soon as we switch on the field pulse ( applied along the reverse direction of the initial spin orientation ) , the spins will tend to orient along the field direction and the spins which are at a state identical to that of its initial state may flip ( depending on the field strength and duration ) and thus the cluster sizes eventually decreases giving rise to a percolation transition .",
    "in this paper we study the percolation transition for a wide range of frustration parameter ( @xmath23 ) and find how the critical field strength varies with the frustration parameter for a particular pulse duration .",
    "we have used monte carlo simulation to obtain the numerical results and fully periodic boundary condition throught our entire study .",
    "we have calculated the critical exponents numerically by finite size scaling analysis to see whether the exponents are affected by the frustration parameter . in section @xmath24 we discuss the model studied . in section @xmath25 , we present the results obtained for the finite size scaling analysis of the percolation order parameter and in section @xmath26 the fractal dimension and the scaling analysis of the binder cumulant . in the final section",
    "we have discussed some consequences related to our study .",
    "the main observation of this work is that the critical exponents are independent of the frustration parameter and also same as that of the normal @xmath27 ising model .",
    "the model studied here is the 2d annni model under a time - dependent external magnetic field pulse , described by the hamiltonian @xmath7 - h(t ) \\sum_{x , y } s_{x , y}\\ ] ] where the sites ( @xmath8,@xmath9 ) runs over a square lattice , the spins @xmath10 are @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the nearest - neighbor interaction strength ( we keep @xmath28 here on ) and @xmath13 is the competition or frustration parameter .",
    "the static critical temperature ( @xmath0 ) depends on the value of @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ani ] ) . for @xmath29 , @xmath30 . for @xmath31 ,",
    "the field pulse applied is spatially uniform ( directed opposite to that of the initial spin configuration we start with ) having a time dependence as : + @xmath32 for @xmath33 , the field pulse applied is such that the field direction is opposite to that of the starting configuration ( antiphase order ) of the spins , but the time dependence is the same as that of eq .",
    "[ field - pulse ] . in our simulation",
    "we ensure that the time @xmath34 at which the pulse is applied , the system reaches its equilibrium configuration at that temperature @xmath35 .",
    "the spins are selected randomly and are flipped following the normal metropolis algorithm . the energy difference ( @xmath36 ) to flip the spin is calculated and flipped with probability min\\{@xmath37}. at @xmath38 , the system acheives a steady state at the corresponding temperature ( in the absence of any field ) . as soon as the field pulse is switched on , a large number of spins which were intact in their initial state , flip during the pulse duration .",
    "thus the percolation order parameter @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 is the size of the largest cluster and @xmath41 is the linear size of the system ) decreases during this duration and for a particular combination of @xmath42 and @xmath2 , for a particular value of @xmath4 , the system undergoes a percolation transition ( fig .",
    "[ compare ] ) .",
    "it is found that for a particular temperature for @xmath31 , as the value of @xmath13 is increased , the transition field @xmath4 decreases , but for @xmath33 , @xmath4 increases with @xmath13 ( fig .  [ fig : kappa_hp ] ) . for @xmath31 , as @xmath13 is increased , the increasing frustration itself destabilises the order and thus the pulse amplitude needed for transition decreases . but",
    "for @xmath33 , the situation is different .",
    "the increasing frustration parameter stabilises the antiphase more and more , thus requiring higher pulse amplitude for the percolation transition ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa_hp ] ) .",
    "in this section we discuss about the percolation transition behaviour . for a particular combination of @xmath43 and @xmath2 ,",
    "we study the variation of @xmath44 with @xmath1 .",
    "the percolation transition is characterised by several exponents which also determine the universality class . the order parameter",
    "i.e. , the relative size of the largest cluster varies as , @xmath45    the correlation length diverges near the percolation transition point as @xmath46 where , @xmath4 is the critical field amplitude . the other exponents can be calculated from various scaling relations @xcite .",
    "but due to finite - size effects it is difficult to determine these exponents precisely .",
    "we have determined these exponents from the finite size scaling relations .",
    "@xmath44 follows the scaling form @xmath47,\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is a suitable scaling function . by tuning @xmath49",
    ", all the @xmath50-@xmath1 curves can be made to cross at a single point and this point determines the critical field amplitude ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "now once @xmath49 and @xmath4 has been estimated , by tuning @xmath51 one can collapse all the @xmath50-@xmath52 curves on one another , and thus @xmath53 is determined .",
    "we have shown both these plots for @xmath54 ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath55 ( @xmath33 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : perc - dist4.klt ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : perc - dist6.kgt ] respectively .",
    "for both the curves we get the same values for @xmath56 and @xmath57 and more importantly this value is the same as that we obtained for the normal 2d ising model found earlier @xcite which indicates that the dynamical percolation transition of the 2d annni model also belongs to the same universality class as that of the normal 2d ising model . only the critical field amplitude changes ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa_hp ] ) .",
    "we have repeated the same exercise for some other combination of @xmath43 and @xmath2 , but the exponents remain unchanged .",
    "this suggests that the magnitude of frustration does not have any drastic effect on the dynamical percolation phenomenon except the quantitative shift of the transition point .    to have a picture of the effect of various parameters on the critical field amplitude we have given two graphs , one for @xmath31 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hp_deltat_klt5 ] ) and the other for @xmath33 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hp_deltat_kgt5 ] ) , each showing the variation of @xmath4 with @xmath2 for different sets of @xmath13 and @xmath3 .",
    "it is quite clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : hp_deltat_klt5 ] that , for any combination of @xmath13 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 decreases with @xmath2 .",
    "also for any comination of @xmath13 and @xmath2 , @xmath4 decreases with @xmath3 , because thermal excitation always helps in percolation transition and thus reducing the necessary external field amplitude .",
    "but the frustration parameter plays an opposite role on the two halves of the @xmath13 regime . for a fixed pair of @xmath3 and @xmath2 ,",
    "when we are below @xmath31 , with increase of @xmath13 we need less field for reaching the transition point because increasing the frustration parameter itself reduces the parallel alignment between the adjacent spins and thus facilitating the transition . but",
    "above @xmath58 , the increase in frustration parameter supports the antiphase structure ( with which we begin the dynamics for @xmath17 ) , and thus we have to apply more field amplitude to flip the spins to opposite direction .",
    "thus the frustration parameter plays opposite role in cluster formation in the two regimes .",
    "at the transition point , the percolation clusters become self similar .",
    "the largest cluster depends on the linear system size and it varies as @xmath59 where @xmath40 is the largest cluster and @xmath60 is the fractal dimension . the fractal dimension measured ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fractald ] ) is found to be independent of the value of @xmath13 and the value is @xmath61 which is again the same as that we found in case of the normal 2d ising model .",
    "this fractal dimension is known to be related to the spatial dimension ( @xmath62 ) as @xmath63 .",
    "this relation is also satisfied for our estimated values of @xmath56 ( mentioned in previous section ) and @xmath60 for all values of @xmath13 .    for further verification of the critical points and the exponents , we have also studied the binder cumulant of the order parameter , defined as @xcite , @xmath64 where @xmath44 is the percolation order parameter and",
    "the angular brackets denote the ensemble average .",
    "the crossing point of the curves @xmath65 for different system sizes gives the critical field amplitude ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the binder cumulant has also been used to determine the correlation length exponent as it follows the scaling form @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a suitable scaling function .",
    "having obtained @xmath4 from the crossing point , if we plot @xmath68 with the scaled field amplitude @xmath52 , for a suitable value of @xmath53 we will obtain a data collapse and that value of @xmath53 determines the correlation length exponent .",
    "we have studied these results both for @xmath31 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : perc - dist4.klt.binder ] ) and @xmath33 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : perc - dist6.kgt.binder ] ) .    for all values of @xmath13 (",
    "only two sets of @xmath69 has been presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : perc - dist4.klt.binder ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : perc - dist6.kgt.binder ] ) , the value of @xmath51 remains same ( @xmath70 ) and also equal to that we have already obtained from that of the finite size scaling of percolation order parameter .",
    "the value of the binder cumulant at the crossing point for various system sizes is also identical ( @xmath71 ) . the only obvious quantitative change is seen for the transition point .",
    "spatially modulated phases of metallic alloys can be investigated in terms of annni model and considering the application of these alloys in magnetisation reversal phenomenon , we have studied the magnetic field - pulse induced percolation phenomenon in 2d annni model .",
    "we have focused on the role of the frustration parameter in affecting the percolation transition of the 2d annni model . by applying magnetic field - pulse of finite duration ( @xmath2 ) for a certain frustration parameter ( @xmath13 ) and temperature ( @xmath3 ) ( below the corresponding static transition temperature )",
    ", we have determined the critical field strength ( @xmath4 ) for which the transition occurs .",
    "although we have found that the frustration parameter highly enriches the static phase diagram of 2d annni model ( various novel phases and transitions appear due to @xmath13 ) , quite surprisingly it does not have any large impact on the dynamical percolation transition apart from shifting the transition points .",
    "we have restricted our study in the regime @xmath23 . from finite size scaling analysis we have showed that both the percolation order parameter and the binder cumulant leads to the same values of critical exponents as we have found for the normal 2d ising model ( thus it belongs to the same universality class as that of the dynamical percolation transition of 2d ising model ) .",
    "the values of exponents determined are @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the fractal dimension @xmath61 also confirms the relations between the exponents .",
    "although we have not presented the details , in this context we have also investigated the transition behaviour of the magnetisation ( for @xmath31 ) and sub - lattice magnetisation ( for @xmath33 ) .",
    "the sub - lattice magnetisation is defined as , @xmath8-direction , the sub - lattice magnetization is defined by @xmath72 with , @xmath73 where @xmath41 is the length of the system .",
    "it has been found that the transition points were same as that of the percolation transition ( for a certain set of value of @xmath43 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "the study of finite - size scaling of the order parameters also gives the same critical exponents ( @xmath49 and @xmath51 ) .",
    "only the value of the crossing point of the binder cumulant for magnetisation shows non - universal behaviour for different temperatures .",
    "this value ( @xmath74 ) is robust in case of percolation transition",
    ".    this study may be useful in the application of magnetisation reversal of spatially modulated magnetic materials where the only change necessary is the value of the magnitude of the critical field , keeping the nature of the transition intact .",
