    "ogle ( optical gravitational lensing experiment , the leader : andrzej udalski ) is a long term project , with a gradual expansion of its capability .",
    "the dedicated 1.3 meter telescope is located at the las campanas observatory in chile , a site owned and operated by the carnegie institution of washington .",
    "ogle is operated by the warsaw university observatory .",
    "information about it may be found at : 0.2 cm    ogle : 1.0 cm http://sirius.astrouw.edu.pl/~  ogle/    ogle : 1.0 cm http://bulge.princeton.edu/~  ogle/ 0.05 cm    0.2 cm    ogle - iii is the current , third stage of the project .",
    "the observations are done with a mosaic @xmath0 ccd camera built by a. udalski . ogle - iii begun in may 2001 . in the 2002 galactic bulge season",
    "almost 400 candidate microlensing events were discovered :    ogle - ews : 1.0 cm http://sirius.astrouw.edu.pl/~  ogle / ogle3/ews / ews.html    a search for planetary transits was conducted on 32 nights during a 45 day interval in 2001 .",
    "a total of 59 stars were identified , for which low depth flat bottom transits with orbital periods shorter than 10 days were found ( udalski et al . 2002a , b ) .",
    "some of these are likely caused by ` hot jupiters ' , others by brown and red dwarfs .",
    "the analysis of ogle - ii stage ( udalski , kubiak & szymaski 1997 ) , which covered years 1997 - 2000 , is advanced , and almost all data is in public domain .",
    "this includes catalogs of i , v , b magnitudes and positions for a total of almost 40 million stars in the galactic bulge , and in the magellanic clouds ( udalski et al .",
    "2002c , 2000b , 1998a ) , catalogs of over 500 microlensing events ( udalski et al .",
    "2000a , woniak et al . 2001 ) , catalogs of over 270 thousand variable stars ( zebru et al .",
    "2001 , woniak et al .",
    "2002 ) , and in particular thousands of eclipsing binaries in the smc ( udalski et al .",
    "1998a ) and cepheids in the lmc and smc ( udalski et al .",
    "1999a , b ) .",
    "in addition ogle astrometry provided proper motion measurements of thousands of stars ( soszyski et al .",
    "2002 , sumi et al .",
    "2002 ) , leading to the discovery of streaming motion ( rotation ) in the galactic bar .    of particular interest",
    "are special microlensing events .",
    "ogle-2000-bul-43 was found to have a spectacular parallax effect ( soszyski et al .",
    "even more dramatic was ogle-1999-bul-19 , the first event with multiple peaks in its apparent brightness caused by the earth s orbital motion and a very long time scale : @xmath1 days ( smith et al .",
    "even longer time scales were found for ogle-1999-bul-32 ( mao et al .",
    "2002 , @xmath2 days and ogle sc_5 2859 ( smith 2002 , @xmath3 days ) .",
    "the last two events are likely caused by massive lenses , probably stellar mass black holes .",
    "asas ( all sky automated survey , the leader : grzegorz pojmaski ) is a long term project , with gradual expansion of its capabilities .",
    "currently it has 4 small instruments , with apertures of 2 cm , 7 cm , 7 cm , and 20 cm , all located at the las campanas observatory in chile , at a site owned and operated by the carnegie institution of washington .",
    "asas is operated by the warsaw university observatory .",
    "information about it may be found at : 0.2 cm    asas : 1.0 cm http://www.astrouw.edu.pl/~  gp / asas / asas.html    asas : 1.0 cm http://archive.princeton.edu/~  asas/ 1.6 cm    0.2 cm    all four instruments use as detectors apogee @xmath4 ccd cameras . the two instruments with 7 cm aperture cover all sky every two nights in standard v and i filters down to about 14 magnitude .",
    "a total of over 6 thousand variables was discovered so far by asas ( pojmaski 1998 , 2000 , 2002 ) , and all photometric data are on the www .",
    "all instruments are fully robotic , with some support provided by the ogle observers .",
    "both projects aim at real time data processing , and in particular at real time recognition and verification of any new events in the sky , among them microlensing events , supernovae , novae , dwarf novae , stellar flares , grb afterglows , etc .",
    "two specific goals of ogle are : a firm detection of microlensing by planets , and by stellar mass black holes .",
    "so far stellar mass black holes were suggested as lensing masses for several long microlensing events ( bennett et al .",
    "2002 , mao et al .",
    "2002 , smith 2002 ) , but evidence is not conclusive .",
    "no definite planetary microlensing event has been discovered so far ( cf . bennett et al .",
    "1999 , albrow et al . 2000 , gaudi et al .",
    "2002 ) .    inspecting almost 400 microlensing events reported by ogle - iii ews ( early warning system ) in 2002",
    "jaroszyski & paczyski ( 2002 ) noticed that the event ogle-2002-blg-055 has a single data point deviating from otherwise smooth microlensing light curve by 0.6 magnitudes , while the photometric errors were about 0.01 magnitude .",
    "udalski kindly examined the ccd image and found that there was nothing wrong with it , i.e. the bright point appears to be real .",
    "as nearby data points show no obvious departure from a smooth light curve a plausible interpretation of the phenomenon is in terms of a binary lens with a very extreme mass ratio .",
    "while a unique value of the mass ratio can not be determined from so sparse time coverage , a good fit to all data was obtained for the mass ratio of 0.01 and 0.001 , indicating a planetary mass companion to a stellar mass lens .",
    "obviously , it is not possible to make a strong claim based on a single data point , but a modest modification of the future ogle observing procedure will provide a far better coverage of future planetary events .",
    "there are typically only several hundred stellar microlensing events unfolding at any given time , compared to over 150 million stars monitored on a given night .",
    "small ccd sub - frames covering known events can be processed within minutes of data acquisition . when an anomalous data point is noticed the observation of the field will be repeated . if the anomaly is confirmed the field",
    "will be observed every 30 or 60 minutes , to provide a good coverage of the rapidly changing brightness , and allowing a unique determination of the mass ratio .",
    "we expect that ogle - iii ews system will have this capability by the spring of 2003 ( a. udalski , private communication ) , and it is likely that the first definite planetary microlensing event will be detected in 2003 .    at the opposite end of the lens mass spectrum are the very long duration events , which are plausible candidates for stellar mass black holes .",
    "currently two independent lens parameters can be determined for long events with the ogle - iii photometry : the event time scale @xmath5 and the magnitude of the parallax effect .",
    "one additional parameter : the angular separation between the two images , or the astrometric shift in the combined light centroid is needed to determine uniquely the lens mass .",
    "it will be possible to make such measurements with the future vlt interferometer ( delplancke et al .",
    "2001 , segransan et al .",
    "2002 ) , or with the existing hst . a massive lens like the one associated with ogle-1999-bul-32 had the two images separated by several milli arc seconds ( mao et al . 2002 ,",
    "9 ) , leading to the centroid motion of a comparable amount .",
    "this astrometric effect is within easy reach of the hst ( e.g. benedict et al .",
    "the long events last several years , and with the ogle - iii data rate there will be several of them unfolding at any given time within several degrees of the galactic center . very likely the vlti and/or hst observations may be scheduled in advanced , with no need for the too ( target of opportunity ) mode of operation .",
    "little is known about the number and the distribution of stellar mass black holes in the galaxy , and the range of their masses .",
    "ogle is likely to lead to the first definite mass determination in 2004 - 2005 .",
    "we expect that ogle as well as asas will expand their capability in the future .",
    "there are no definite and specific plans for the expansion , but there is a general idea how to proceed . a natural step to ogle - iv would be another 1.3 - 1.8 meter telescope with a ccd camera with a total of @xmath6 giga pixels , i.e. an instrument with the data rate 16 times higher than current ogle - iii .",
    "the data rate is the single most important parameter for the search and/or monitoring projects like ogle and asas . for asas",
    "we expect more frequent all sky coverage , with a more gradual increase in its depth .",
    "a virtue of bright transients is that they may be followed up for a longer time , in greater detail and with more instruments than faint transients can .",
    "obviously , bright transients are rare , hence the need for all sky coverage and a frequent time sampling .",
