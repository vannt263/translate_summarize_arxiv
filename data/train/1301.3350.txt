    "algebra and logic are two dominant approaches for the specification , verification and systematic development of reactive and concurrent systems .",
    "they take different standpoints for looking at specifications and verifications , and offer complementary advantages .",
    "logical approaches devote themselves to specifying and verifying abstract properties of systems . in such frameworks , the most common reasonable property of concurrent systems , such as safety , liveness , etc .",
    ", can be formulated in terms of logic formulas without resorting to operational details and verification is a deductive or model - checking activity .",
    "however , due to their global perspective and abstract nature , logical approaches often give little support for modular designing and compositional reasoning .",
    "algebraic approaches put attention to behavioral aspects of systems , which have tended to use formalisms in algebraic style .",
    "these formalisms are referred to as process algebra or process calculus .",
    "in such a paradigm , a specification and its implementation usually are formulated by terms ( expressions ) of a formal language built from a number of operators , and the underlying semantics is often assigned operationally",
    ". the verification amounts to comparing terms , which is often referred to as _ implementation verification _ or _",
    "equivalence checking_. algebraic approaches often support compositional construction and reasoning , which bring us advantages in developing systems , such as , supporting modular design and verification , avoiding verifying the whole system from scratch when its parts are modified , allowing reusability of proofs and so on @xcite .",
    "thus such approaches offer significant support for rigorous systematic development of reactive and concurrent systems .",
    "however , since algebraic approaches specify a system by means of prescribing in detail how the system should behave , it is often difficult for them to describe abstract properties of systems , which is a major disadvantage of such approaches .    in order to take advantage of these two approaches when designing systems ,",
    "so - called heterogeneous specifications have been proposed , which uniformly integrate these two specification styles . amongst , based on bchi automata and labelled transition system ( lts ) augmented with a predicate , cleaveland and lttgen provide a semantic framework for heterogenous system design ( cleaveland and lttgen 2000 , 2002 ) . in this framework , not only usual operational operators but also logic connectives are considered , and must - testing preorder presented in @xcite is adopted to capture refinement relation .",
    "unfortunately , this setting does not support compositional reasoning since must - testing preorder is not a precongruence in this situation .",
    "moreover , the logic connective conjunction in this framework lacks the desired property that @xmath4 is an implementation of a given specification @xmath5 if and only if @xmath4 implements both @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "recently , lttgen and vogler have introduced the notion of a logic lts ( llts ) , which combines operational and logic styles of specification in one unified framework ( lttgen and vogler 2007 , 2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "in addition to usual operational constructors , e.g. , csp - style parallel composition , hiding and so on , logic connectives ( conjunction and disjunction ) and standard modal operators ( @xmath2 and @xmath8 ) are also integrated into this framework .",
    "moreover , the drawbacks in ( cleaveland and lttgen 2000 , 2002 ) mentioned above have been remedied by adopting ready - tree semantics @xcite . in order to support compositional reasoning in the presence of the parallel constructor ,",
    "a variant of the usual notion of ready simulation is employed to capture the refinement relation , which has been shown to be the largest precongruence satisfying some desired properties @xcite .    along the direction suggested by lttgen and vogler in @xcite , a process calculus called cll",
    "is presented in @xcite , which reconstructs their setting in pure process - algebraic style .",
    "moreover , a sound and ground - complete proof system for cll is provided . in effect",
    ", it gives an axiomatization of ready simulation in the presence of logic operators .",
    "however , cll is lack of capability of describing infinite behaviour , that is important for representing reactive systems .",
    "it is well known that recursive operations are fundamental mechanisms for representing objects with infinite behavior in terms of finite expressions ( see , for instance @xcite ) .",
    "we extend cll with recursive operations and propose a process calculus named cll@xmath9 . since llts involves consideration of inconsistencies , it is far from straightforward to re - establish existent results concerning recursive operations in this framework .",
    "a solid effort is required , especially for handling inconsistencies .",
    "this paper intends to explore recursive operations over llts in pure process - algebraic style .",
    "a behavioral theory of cll@xmath9 will be established , especially , we prove that the behavioral relation ( i.e. , ready simulation mentioned above ) is precongruent w.r.t all operators in cll@xmath9 .",
    "moreover , the uniqueness of solution of equations will be obtained , provided conditions that , given an equation @xmath10 , @xmath11 is strongly guarded and does not occur in the scope of any conjunction in @xmath12 .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section recalls some related notions .",
    "section  3 introduces sos rules of @xmath13 . in section  4",
    ", the existence and uniqueness of stable transition model for @xmath14 is demonstrated , and a few of basic properties of the lts associated with @xmath14 are given .",
    "more further properties are considered in section  5 . in section  6",
    ", we shall show that the variant of ready simulation presented by lttgen and vogler is precongruent in the presence of ( nested ) recursive operations . in section  7 ,",
    "a theorem on the uniqueness of solution of equations is obtained .",
    "finally , a brief conclusion and discussion are given in section  8 .",
    "this subsection will set up notations and briefly recall the notions of logic lts and ready simulation presented by l \" uttgen and vogler .",
