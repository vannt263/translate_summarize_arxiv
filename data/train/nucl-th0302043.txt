    "weakly bound systems have attracted a lot of attention in different domain of physics .",
    "halo nuclei have been studied for several years using various probes @xcite .",
    "diffuse van - der - waals dimers and trimers represent another interesting example , such as @xmath4 whose existence has been established only recently @xcite .",
    "all these systems are characterized by very large spatial extensions on one hand and very small separation energies on the other hand .",
    "for example , the one - neutron halo @xmath5 has a separation energy of about 0.5 mev , the average separation energy being of 6 mev , while the average distance between the halo neutron and the core is about 7 fm .",
    "the @xmath4 dimer is a paragon : its predicted dissociation energy is 0.1 @xmath6ev , whereas the ionization energy is of about 27 ev and the measured average distance between the two atoms is of about 52 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this is by far the largest dimer ever observed !",
    "one of the intriguing features of very weakly bound systems is that they can reveal `` universal '' behaviors , i.e. independent of the specific interaction which keeps together the particles .",
    "an example is given by the relation between the size of the system , which can be characterized through different moments of the wave function , like the mean square radius or @xmath8 , and the ( separation or dissociation ) energy @xmath9 necessary to break the system , that is @xmath10 this relation is often called ( asymptotic ) scaling law .",
    "several works exist on the topic of scaling laws for two- and three - body systems obtained with short - range and repulsive ( mainly coulomb ) long - range interactions @xcite . for the short - range case ,",
    "so far only potentials defined by two parameters , the depth and the range , have been considered .",
    "recently these investigations have been widened by the study of a larger class of potentials @xcite , namely : _",
    "i ) _ short range potentials having a repulsive core to simulate the pauli exclusion principle ; _ ii ) _ long - range attractive potentials . here",
    "we report on this investigation and describe how scaling laws for short - range potentials are modified by the presence of the core .",
    "we present scaling laws for long - range interactions and emphasize analogies and differences between the short- and the long - range case .    finally , we come to a question which has been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite , namely : what is a halo system ?",
    "the image we are now accustomed to is the one in which the halo particle has a very large probability of being outside the classically allowed region .",
    "this image needs to be enlarged if one wants to include the case of long - range potentials , as we will discuss .",
    "scaling laws for two - body systems ( [ e:1 ] ) can be treated in the context of the two - body problem in quantum mechanics .",
    "a bound state of the system is then identified as a bound state of the potential @xmath11 acting between the two atoms or the core and the halo nucleon in a nucleus .",
    "the separation energy of the system @xmath12 is taken equal to the energy of the bound state @xmath13 .",
    "there are ( at least ) three possible ways to tackle this problem @xcite :    * using very general arguments , without specifying the potential @xmath11 .",
    "these arguments are based , for example , on inequalities like the bertlmann - martin inequality , or on properties of the schrdinger equation . ]",
    "( @xmath14 ) : @xmath15   \\psi_{\\ell}(r)= e_{\\ell}\\psi_{\\ell}(r ) , \\ ] ] such as its invariance under the transformation @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 characterizes the range of the potential . *",
    "once the range of the potential is defined , in the limit of very small binding one can make the following approximations : _",
    "i ) _ for short - range potentials the wave function is mainly given by the tail outside the potential , i.e. by the hankel wave function @xmath19 with @xmath20 ; _ ii ) _ for long - range potentials the wave function , mainly inside the potential , can be taken as the spherical bessel function of the first kind @xmath21 with @xmath22 , cutting the integrals at the first zero .",
    "* specific potentials can be used to get quantitative estimates .",
    "for the class of short - range potentials going to zero faster than @xmath23 , the scaling laws are @xcite :    @xmath24    for s- ( @xmath25 ) , p- ( @xmath26 ) and d - states as well . ] ( @xmath27 ) . as we can see",
    ", the mean square radius diverges as @xmath28 and as @xmath29 for s- and p - states respectively , but no divergence is present for states having @xmath30 .",
    "if we take the divergence of the second moment of the wave function as a reference for the appearance of halos , we can say that halos may occur for s- and p - states , in the limit of very weak binding , but that such phenomenon can not appear for states of higher @xmath0 .",
    "the relations ( [ e:3 ] ) have been obtained using the behavior of the tail of the wave functions @xcite .",
    "this automatically implies that the constants @xmath31 are independent of the potential @xmath32 .",
    "numerical studies have also been performed in the past to check the sensitivity of @xmath33 $ ] to the specific shape of the potentials ; but so far potentials defined by their depth and their range ( like the square well and the gaussian potential ) have been considered .",
    "however , strictly speaking the scaling law is completely independent of the shape of the short - range potential for the s - state only , since @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "can physical systems , like halo nuclei or diffuse dimers , attain this region of very small binding , where the scaling law ( [ e:3 ] ) become completely independent of the potential ? this can be easily checked by looking if @xmath35 .",
    "we show results for @xmath5 and the @xmath4 dimer from calculations in @xcite which well reproduce the measured @xmath36 of @xmath4 . ] , as examples ( fig.1 ) .",
    "we can see that if nuclear halo systems are located in a region which is still sensitive to the specific choice of the potential , diffuse dimers attain the region of very weak binding @xcite .",
    "concerning the other coefficients @xmath31 ( @xmath37 ) , if one considers a larger class of short - range potentials , defined by more than two - parameters , like those including a repulsive core , the independence of ( [ e:3 ] ) from the potential is no more strictly true @xcite . to illustrate how @xmath31 depend on @xmath32 , we compare the results obtained with a two parameters potential and with a potential including a repulsive core ( fig.1 ) .",
    "we can see that the higher @xmath0 is , the stronger is the dependence of @xmath31 and therefore of the corresponding scaling law ( [ e:3 ] ) on the shape of the potential .",
    "in fact , the role played by the centrifugal barrier is the larger , the higher is @xmath0 . as a consequence , the wave function is pushed more and more inside the potential and becomes sensitive to its specific shape .",
    "+    for the states having @xmath42 , the mean square radius always diverges as @xmath43 , contrary to the short - range case ( [ e:3 ] ) .",
    "therefore systems kept together by a long - range interaction can develop very large extensions , and this for states of any angular momentum @xmath0 ! this difference with the known short - range case results can be intuitively understood .",
    "in fact , in the long - range case the centrifugal barrier is not playing a major role in confining the halo particle inside the potential .",
    "an example of very extended systems bound by a long - range interaction is already known : rydberg atoms .",
    "however , there is a major difference .",
    "here we are predicting that there may exist very weakly bound two - body systems bound by long - range interactions having large spatial extensions in their lowest energy states .",
    "how to define a halo system has been the object of extensive discussions in the literature .",
    "nowadays we think of halo systems as systems in which the halo particle has a very high probability of being outside the classical turning point @xcite . in the case of long - range potentials",
    "the particle is mainly in the classical allowed region .",
    "the appearance of halos can still be characterized in a common way for both the short- and the long - range cases : the @xmath44 has to be much larger than a typical physical length of the system ( such as for example the size of the core ) .",
    "these new results tell us that the appearance of halos is a threshold phenomenon , independent of the range , short or long , of the interaction and therefore also of the time spent by the halo particle inside or outside the classical region .",
