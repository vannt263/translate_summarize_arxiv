    "such setup can be interpreted as two linear amplifiers with distinct features , complementing each other by sharing the burden of amplification .",

    "conversely , a higher probability of success , though with an increased noise , can be obtained by increasing the dla gain .",
    "hence , by tailoring both gains appropriately , one can achieve the desired cloning fidelity , with vanishing probability of success as the fidelity approaches unity .",

    "@xmath76 converges to 1 in the limit of an infinite number of clones .",
    "however , since this also requires an infinitely large nondeterministic gain , and thus an unbounded truncation in post - selection , the probability of success will be essentially zero .",
    "in summary , we have proposed and demonstrated a hybrid cloning machine that combines a deterministic and a probabilistic amplifier to clone unknown coherent states with fidelity beyond the no - cloning limit . even though an ideal nla implementation is not possible with our setup , as this would require zero deterministic gain , our hybrid approach does allow the integration of measurement - based nla in the optimal deterministic amplifier .",

    "our cloner , while only working probabilistically , provides a clear heralding signal for all successful cloning events .",
    "several comments on the prospects and avenues for future work are in order .",
