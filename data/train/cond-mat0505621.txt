    "various candidates for realizing building blocks of quantum information processors with nanoscale solid state structures have been proposed and also partially realized in ground - breaking experiments .",
    "an important class of proposals consists of using the charge degree of freedom in semiconducting double quantum dots ( dqds ) @xcite to realize a quantum mechanical two - state system or quantum bit ( qubit).@xcite thereby , the logical states @xmath1 and @xmath2 are given by the low - energy charge states of the dqd with one excess electron either on the left or the right dot .",
    "the transition between these states occurs via tunneling between the two dots .",
    "a significant advantage of the charge qubit is its direct controllability via external voltage sources . in recent experiments ,",
    "the coherent manipulation of charge states of dqds has been achieved.@xcite thereby , the control over the bias and the gate voltages permits to reliably tune the dqd in the coulomb blockade regime to the required transition line @xmath3 .",
    "the large charging energies suppress leakage to energetically higher lying many - electron states .    a central impediment for coherent quantum information processes is decoherence and dissipation , see ref .",
    "for a particular example .",
    "since charge qubits are rather easily addressable from outside , they are , in turn , also rather fragile for various decoherence mechanisms from the environment . in order to achieve a thorough understanding of the role of the various decoherence mechanisms",
    ", one has to rely on realistic and precise model calculations which allow to sort out the different contributions . among them , decoherence due to acoustic phonons is one possible candidate .",
    "this mechanism has been studied previously upon using approaches relying on the born - markov approximation.@xcite the decoherence rates obtained in these studies were one or two orders of magnitude smaller than those determined experimentally for gaas dqds.@xcite however , no exact treatment was available to validate the born - markov approximation in the dqd context .",
    "this is particularly interesting in view of realistic dqd designs since geometrical form factors tailor a rather peculiar spectral density @xmath4 of the phonon environment . for piezoelectric phonons",
    ", it has a high - frequency tail decaying only algebraically with @xcite @xmath5 while it is superohmic at low frequencies with @xmath6 , with a crossover at frequencies in the regime of the tunneling amplitude of the dqd . as it has also been pointed out in ref .",
    ", the use of the born - markov approximation is appropriate only at small tunneling amplitudes .",
    "however , is is expected to become increasingly unreliable at dqd with larger interdot tunneling amplitudes . the motivation to find exact reference solutions for this problems also stems from the fact that the born - markov approximation has led to the conclusion that other mechanisms of decoherence , as for instance , background charge fluctuations and electromagnetic noise from voltage fluctuations , would be the dominating source of decoherence while phonon decoherence should be a negligible contribution . in view of further design optimization for real devices ,",
    "exact results are clearly desirable .    in this paper , we study phonon decoherence using the same model as in ref .   as a basis for the numerically exact iterative quasiadiabatic propagator path integral ( quapi ) scheme .",
    "@xcite in particular , we avoid the born - markov approximation which turns out to be problematic at larger tunneling amplitudes @xmath7 of the dqd",
    ". the decaying oscillations of dqd charge states allows us to extract the quality ( or q- ) factor .",
    "we find that @xmath0 decreases with increasing tunneling amplitudes @xmath7 for small @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , the solution in this regime is accurately described by the weak - coupling result for a superohmic environment.@xcite at large @xmath7 , the @xmath0-factor increases with increasing @xmath7 and the non - markovian corrections become noticeable changing even the order of magnitude of @xmath0 . in between these two regimes , a crossover occurs which is related to the geometry of the dqd , see below . in particular , our numerical precise method allows to obtain results for the dqd device recently realized in experiments.@xcite we find that the calculated value lies approximately two orders of magnitude above the experimentally measured value .",
    "indeed , this suggests that the phonon decoherence mechanism is subordinate and other mechanisms dominate decoherence in dqd charge states which have been realized until now . in comparison to the results from the born - markov approximation , we find that the exact @xmath0-factor is in general larger , indicating that the former overestimates phonon decoherence .",
    "in order to solely investigate the role of the phonons in the decoherence processes , we start with the simplifying assumption that the dqd is isolated from the leads . the total hamiltonian is given by@xcite @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is the hamiltonian of the dqd which is modeled in the basis of the two localized charge states @xmath10 and @xmath11 as a symmetric two - level - system in pseudo - spin notation ( @xmath12 are the pauli matrices ) as @xmath13 in this simple model , we have assumed that the external gate voltage is tuned such that the two charge states are energetically nearly degenerate and that the excess electron can tunnel between the two dots with the tunneling amplitude @xmath7 . a possible energy bias between the two states",
    "could easily be included in the model but is not considered in this work .",
    "the hamiltonian for the phonon bath is , as usual , given by @xmath14 with the phonon dispersion relation @xmath15 .",
    "the interaction part of the hamiltonian is determined by the electron - phonon interaction and reads @xcite @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is the number of the excess electrons on the left / right ( @xmath18l / r ) dot and @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the position vectors of the two dots . as in ref .",

    "[ fig.geometry ] for a sketch .",
    "the two dots are assumed to have an equal radius of @xmath24 and to be confined to the @xmath25-plane in the underlying 2deg .",

    ", we associate a form factor @xmath28 to each dot , where @xmath29 is the charge density distribution of the dot . in the following ,",
    "the two dots are assumed to have identical form factors . with this",
    "the coupling hamiltonian simplifies to @xcite @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "notice that the phonons can propagate in all three dimensions and that the electron - phonon - coupling is not isotropic.@xcite having specified the coupling , we can now introduce the spectral density of the phonon bath which reads @xmath32 as in ref .  , we specialize to linear acoustic phonons with velocity @xmath33 ( @xmath34 m / s for gaas ) and linear dispersion @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , we only consider coupling to longitudinal piezoelectric phonons and neglect the contribution of the deformation potential which is justifiable at temperatures below 10 k for bulk gaas material.@xcite this yields the coupling constant @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the dimensionless piezoelectric constant ( @xmath38 for gaas ) and @xmath39 being the volume of the unit cell . assuming that the charge density distribution on the dot is gaussian in the @xmath25-plane and localized in the @xmath40-direction , one finds for the spectral density of the bath @xcite @xmath41 \\ , .",

    "the often used born - markov approximation corresponds to replacing the strongly peaked real part @xmath55 by a @xmath57-function with the corresponding weight while the imaginary part @xmath58 is often neglected .",

    "we have investigated the quality ( @xmath0- ) factor as a function of the tunneling splitting and have compared our results with those obtained from a weak - coupling approximation within an analytical approach in terms of real - time path - integrals .",

    "however , at larger ( but still realistic ) values of the tunneling amplitude , non - markovian corrections appears and are relevant .",

    ", we find that the theory predicts a @xmath0-factor two orders of magnitudes larger than the measured value .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that phonon decoherence is a subordinate mechanism in gaas quantum dots realized with present state - of - the - art technology .",
    "clearly , other forms of coupling to the external environment prevail for those already realized devices .",
    "however , our results also represent a fundamental upper limit to the coherence of dqd charge qubits which can hardly be overcome due to its intrinsic nature",
