    "galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) are the oldest known objects for which accurate ages can be derived . for this reason , they play a major role in posing a lower limit to the age of the universe , thus constraining cosmological models ( e.g. , van den bergh 1992 ; bolte & hogan 1995 ; vandenberg , bolte , & stetson 1996 ; chaboyer et al .  1996 ; mould 1998 ) and scenarios for the early formation history of the galaxy and its nearby companions ( e.g. , eggen , lynden - bell , & sandage 1962 ; mironov & samus 1974 ; searle & zinn 1978 ; zinn 1980 , 1993 ; brocato et al .  1996 ; buonanno et al .",

    "from a theoretical point of view , it is crucial that the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of gcs be accurately reproduced by theoretical isochrones and synthetic cmds , so that the stellar structure and evolution models , as well as the model atmospheres used to transfer the predicted @xmath7 and @xmath8 values into observed magnitudes and colors , can be relied upon for ages to be determined from the observations ( e.g. , vandenberg et al .  1996 ; salaris , deglinnocenti , & weiss 1997 ; vandenberg & irwin 1997 ; cassisi et al .  1999 ; vandenberg 1999 ) .    of primary interest for these purposes",
    "are the main - sequence ( ms ) and horizontal - branch ( hb ) evolutionary phases .",
    "more specifically , both the ms turnoff luminosity and the hb morphology are sensitive to age , with the former being the standard clock for gc age determination ( iben & renzini 1984 ) .",

    "( note that the hottest bhb stars in m30 lie close to the limiting temperature for the occurence of the jump . ) therefore , the effect is by no means restricted to the case of m13 , originally investigated by grundahl et al .",

    "in the case of m13 , _ the jump occurs at intermediate temperatures only _ ;    3 .",

    "the _ color @xmath22 appears to change little from cluster to cluster , even when the [ fe / h ] values are quite different_.    the occurrence of _ the jump is most decidedly not a spurious consequence of the telescope and/or instrumentation used _ , since it is independently seen with data obtained using four filter / detector combinations .",
    "we also point out that the jump is evident in _ all instrumental _ cmds as well , thus ruling out any problems arising from the adopted data reduction or calibration procedures (  2 ) as a  cause \" for the occurrence of the @xmath2-jump .",
    "more detailed information can be obtained from the entries in table  1 . before discussing it in depth (  3.3 )",

    "1)especially since , as already noted , the jump is best described as a systematic deviation in @xmath2 magnitudes _ and/or _ @xmath1 colors with respect to the canonical zahbs .",
    "specifically , for each hb star we measured its projected distance from the zahb ( @xmath28 ) as well as the  path length \" ( @xmath27 ) along the theoretical zahb for the appropriate metallicity . the zero point for @xmath27",

    "increases with increasing @xmath1 and @xmath28 is positive for stars lying at luminosities higher than the theoretical zahb model ; both quantities are measured in magnitudes . since the zahb models have been fit to the hb stars cooler than the jump , these stars will have @xmath28 values close to zero",
    ". dashed horizontal lines are added to locate the @xmath28  =  0.0 and @xmath28  =  0.25 loci .",
    "the latter value corresponds to our estimate of the change in @xmath28 ( or  jump size \" ) for m13 , as can be seen by inspection of the middle left panel in figure  2 .",
    "we have not calculated @xmath27 and @xmath28 for the hst data set , as we do not have the models transformed to the appropriate colors and magnitudes .",
    "the zahb overplotted in the hst cmd for m13 refers to the @xmath2 ,  @xmath4 system , and not to the wfpc2 filters , and is only intended to guide the eye .",
    "note that our zahb models do not extend to very small envelope masses , implying that @xmath27 ( and hence @xmath28 ) for the hottest hb stars can not be directly estimated on their basis .",
    "we have therefore extended the zahb locus , extrapolating it and adding ( by hand ) an extra point in our @xmath30 zahb sequences such that these stars could be included .",
    "similarly the detailed morphology of the zahb tracks for the coolest hb stars leads to some ambiguity in the measurement of @xmath28 for these stars .",
    "we have thus excluded these stars from figure 2 .",
    "we emphasize that our adopted procedure to deal with the hottest / coolest bhb stars has _ no _ effect on the conclusions of this paper .",
    "for all the clusters ( fig .",
    "2)except m15 , for which there is a lack of stars ",
    "it is easy to determine the @xmath27location of the jump , which we simply estimate by eye . in order to assess the error in @xmath21 we estimated by eye the minimum and maximum  tolerable \" values of @xmath21 for each cluster and adopted half the distance between these two points as our error .",
    "since @xmath27 is measured along the theoretical zahb it has a one - to - one relationship with @xmath31 ; we then proceeded to calculate @xmath22 from the @xmath27 location of the jump .",
    "an error of 0.01  mag in @xmath1 at the color of the jump corresponds to an error of approximately 56  k in temperature .",
    "the @xmath22 colors thus determined can be found in table  1 , along with the estimated errors . directly from the @xmath30 cmds presented in figure  1 . in all cases",
    "the agreement was better than 0.03  mag , which is within the errors in the determination of the jump location ( see table  1 ) . ]    having determined such colors , we evaluated the corresponding temperature @xmath23 and mass @xmath24 values characterizing the canonical zahb models for the metallicity of the adopted zahb model by cubic spline interpolation in @xmath31 .",
    "these quantities are also given in table  1 , and will be discussed in  3.3 below . combining the error in @xmath22 with the expected photometric zero point errors we estimate that the typical errors in @xmath23 and @xmath24 are 300  k ( smaller for m13 and ngc  6752 ) and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "note that our error estimates ignore any potential errors in the models , as well as uncertainties in the adopted reddening values and cluster - to - cluster differences in sample size ; these may appear as an additional source of random scatter among the various clusters .",
    "table  1 provides detailed quantitative information on the nature of the @xmath2-jump in our set of gcs , as well as some of the most relevant physical parameters characterizing the latter .",
    "the most important implications from this table include the following :    1 .",
    "remarkably , the onset of the @xmath2-jump occurs at a color @xmath22 which is essentially the same ( within the errors ) for every gc in our sample ( except possibly for m3 and m92 ) , irrespective of metallicity , central density , concentration , or mixing history on the rgb ; } < -1.65 $ ] ( m92 ) , we caution that a small metallicity dependence of @xmath22 could be present .",
    "more data for metal - poor gcs are needed to settle this issue .",
    "we stress however that _ if _ present such a relation amounts to a change of only @xmath33  k between @xmath34 } = -1.3 $ ] and @xmath34 } = -2.3 $ ] . ]",
    "2 .  due to the low dependence of the color - temperature transformations on metallicity",
    ", it also follows from the above that the temperature @xmath23 is also essentially the same for all gcs in our sample , irrespective of metallicity , central density , concentration , or mixing history on the rgb ;    3 .  unlike @xmath23",
    ", the mass cutoff @xmath24 is found to depend on metallicity , increasing with decreasing [ fe / h ] at a rate @xmath35 } \\approx -0.09\\ ,        m_{\\sun}\\,{\\rm dex}^{-1}$ ] .",
    "such a mass variation ( at an essentially constant temperature ) can be ascribed to the behavior of the canonical zahb models as a function of metallicity ;    4 .",
    "it thus follows that @xmath23 is the fundamental quantity characterizing the onset of the @xmath2-jump , rather than the mass at that point ;    5 .",
    "the size of the @xmath2-jump is also remarkably constant amongst our sample of gcs , as is evident from inspection of figure  2 ;    6 .",
    "no metal - poor gc is known which does not show a @xmath11-jump .",
    "therefore this too seems to be a ubiquitous phenomenon .",
    "however , while every gc with a @xmath11-jump also shows a @xmath2-jump , the converse can not yet be stated with certainty , given that gravities have not yet been measured for an extensive sample of gcs ;    7 .",
    "importantly , the presence of a @xmath11-jump , like that of a @xmath2-jump , seems to be completely uncorrelated with any physical parameter of the gcs , including the metallicity . from figure  9 in moehler et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , one can also see that the boundaries of the @xmath11-jump region do not vary as a function of metallicity .",
    "remarkably , _ the occurrence of the @xmath11-jump too does not seem to depend on the mixing history of the gc stars during the rgb phase _ ;    8 .",
    "the presence of the @xmath2-jump does not depend on the gc dynamics . in our sample",
    ", we have loose gcs ( m12 , m30 , ngc  288 ) showing @xmath2-jumps which are extremely similar to those found in much more concentrated gcs ( m80 , ngc  1851 ) .",
    "the phenomenon also extends to the realm of core - collapsed gcs with extremely high central densities ( m15 , ngc  6397 , ngc  6752 ) .",
    "again , the same can be said about the @xmath11-jump ;    9 .",
    "the jump phenomenon  whether @xmath2- or @xmath11- does not appear to depend on the distance from the center of the galaxy .",
    "however , since we do not have bulge , disk or outer - halo gcs in our sample , we can not give support to the more general conclusion that the jump phenomenon does not depend on the stellar population to which the cluster belongs : bulge , disk , inner halo , or outer halo .",
    "figures  3a ( @xmath2 ,  @xmath1 plane ) and 3b ( @xmath27 ,  @xmath28 plane ) show a direct comparison between our calibrated cmds for m13 ( circles ) and ngc  288 ( plus signs ) .",
    "this figure shows that , _ notwithstanding the different metallicities and mixing histories on the rgb ( see table  1 ) , m13 and ngc  288 present remarkably similar jump location , size , and overall morphology_.      in several of the observed clusters it is evident ( figs .  1 and 2 ) that stars on the hot side of the jump region again approach the canonical zahb , as is particularly evident for m13in which case we estimate a temperature of @xmath36  k for the end of the jump region . the data presented here for the other clusters with extremely long blue tails ( m2 , m79 and ngc  6752 ) appear to show that the temperature at which stars again approach the zahb varies .",
    "for these three the data were obtained at eso for the central regions in seeing which was significantly poorer than for the m13 observations .",
    "consequently we can not at present decide whether the apparent differences for the location of the hot end of the jump are significant or due to the effects of poor seeing and crowding .",
    "only observations obtained under better seeing conditions can decide this issue .",
    "analysis of table  1 , as we have seen above , already hints that there may be a connection between the @xmath2-jump and the @xmath11-jump .",

    "as can be seen from this figure , stars located in the @xmath2-jump region ( circles ) are univocally located inside the @xmath11-jump region as well .",

    "can easily be accounted for on the basis of observational errors .",
    "as an explanation for the @xmath2-jump , grundahl et al .",
    "( 1998 ) tentatively suggested that very deep mixing during the rgb phase  reaching , in fact , all the way into the hydrogen - burning shell and leading to non - canonical dredge - up of helium to the envelope  could provide an explanation for their observations .",
    "this would appear to be an especially compelling explanation in the case of m13 , for which deep mixing among rgb stars is extremely well documented ( see table  1 ) .",
    "such helium mixing was first conjectured by vandenberg & smith ( 1988 ) , who highlighted the implications it would have upon our understanding of such problems involving the hb phase as the period - shift effect (  1 ) .",
    "the idea was later revived by langer & hoffmann ( 1995 ) , and especially by sweigart ( 1997a , 1997b ) .",
    "it is generally assumed that mixing processes on the rgb are somehow related to stellar rotation , as in the meridional circulation theory ( sweigart & mengel 1979 ; see also kraft 1994 , 1998 , 1999 and sneden 1999 for recent reviews ) .    as pointed out by sweigart ( 1997b ) , one key aspect of the helium mixing theory",
    "is that al enhancements , according to rgb nucleosynthesis models computed by langer , hoffman , & sneden ( 1993 ) , langer & hoffman ( 1995 ) , cavallo , sweigart , & bell ( 1996 , 1998 ) , etc .",

    "in fact , such temperatures should be _ substantially _ higher than that found at the h - burning shell in the models ( e.g. , langer , hoffman , & zaidins 1997 ; denissenkov et al .",
    "1998 ) : @xmath39  k , as opposed to @xmath40  k. mixing to such high temperatures is completely ruled out by canonical evolutionary theory , and is not envisaged in sweigart s ( 1997a , 1997b ) helium - mixing theory either .",
    "thus , the basic nuclear - reaction mechanism which lies at the root of the helium - mixing scenario remains unsettled . and , as emphasized by denissenkov et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ,   ` unfortunately ' [ sic ] , nuclear physicists seem to have little ( if any ) doubt concerning the current @xmath38mg(p,@xmath41)@xmath42al reaction rate \" . for further discussion ,",

    "( 1997 ) , and denissenkov et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . ]",
    "hence , any al overabundance should necessarily be accompanied by the dredge - up of helium freshly produced inside the shell .",
    "this is a particularly important result , given that large al overabundances are indeed observed among rgb stars in several gcs [ see table  1 , and also norris & da costa 1995a , 1995b and zucker , wallerstein , & brown 1996 for the impressive case of @xmath43  cen ( ngc  5139 ) ; recent reviews have been provided by kraft 1994 , 1998 , 1999 and sneden 1999 ] .",
    "if helium mixing were present among galactic gcs , one would expect a correlation between hb morphology and o , na , mg , and al abundance variations on the rgb .",
    "indeed , a correlation between hb morphology and the presence / extent of signatures of deep mixing on the rgb has been independently suggested by several different authors ( catelan & de freitas pacheco 1995 ; kraft et al .",
    "1995 , 1998 ; peterson , rood , & crocker 1995 ; carretta & gratton 1996 ) .",
    "in fact , helium mixing stands out as the best candidate to explain the anomalous hb morphology of the  metal - rich \" gcs ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 ( sweigart & catelan 1998 ; layden et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we thus attempt to ascertain the extent to which helium mixing on the rgb may be responsible for the @xmath2- and @xmath11-jump phenomenon .",
    "sweigart ( 1997b ) has shown that it is possible to reproduce the @xmath11 , @xmath12 pattern seen among all gc bhb stars observed to date by invoking helium mixing on the rgb .",
    "it is useful to recall what requirements such helium - mixed stars would have to fulfill in order to explain the jump phenomenon .",
    "expanding on sweigart s ( 1997b ) scenario , one would expect the following behavior as a function of zahb temperature :    1 .",
    "@xmath44 : hb progenitors ( i.e. , rgb stars ) do not experience significant helium mixing , and hb stars accordingly lie along canonical evolutionary tracks ;    2 .",
    "@xmath45 : hb stars are somewhat more luminous than canonical models due to a larger helium abundance ( @xmath46 ) in their envelopes ;    3 .",
    "@xmath47 : the increase in envelope helium abundance due to deep mixing becomes very large , @xmath48 ;    4 .",
    "@xmath49 : the hb luminosity is dominated by the helium - burning core ( as opposed to the hydrogen - burning shell at lower temperatures , which is now inert ) , and so the helium - mixed and canonical models essentially agree  even though the envelope helium abundance in the helium - mixed models can be @xmath50 .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to directly test for the presence of enhanced surface helium because helium is generally observed to be depleted in the photospheres of hot hb stars ( e.g. , moehler et al .",
    "1997 ) , most likely due to diffusion processes (  6 ) .",
    "we suggest , however , that the helium mixing pattern among bhb stars , as described above , is unlikely .",
    "we have four main arguments against helium mixing as an explanation for the jump based on the morphology of the @xmath2 ,  @xmath1 and @xmath11 ,  @xmath12 diagrams :    1 .",
    "the variation of @xmath51 with temperature required by sweigart ( 1997b ) , not having been derived from first principles , can only be achieved by fine - tuning of free parameters in the helium - mixing theory . even if one assumes that there is a ",
    "cutoff rotational velocity \" beyond which mixing occurs , but below which no mixing takes place , it seems virtually impossible to produce a low - temperature cutoff for the jump which is so remarkably constant  i.e .",
    ", to within @xmath52  k  from one gc to the next , given the strong dependence of zahb properties upon variations in gc evolutionary parameters ( e.g. , sweigart & gross 1976 )",
    ". in fact , given that the hb effective temperature becomes less sensitive to changes in mass as the metallicity decreases ( see fig .",
    "7 in buonanno , corsi , & fusi pecci 1985 ) , one would expect some intrinsic relationship between @xmath23 and [ fe / h ] .",
    "as already mentioned (  3.3 ) , any intrinsic relationship between @xmath23 and [ fe / h ] , if present at all , seems to be quite mild",
    ". this may be called the _  global \" fine - tuning problem_. this global fine - tuning problem is a major impediment facing _ any _ stellar evolution - related scenario for the jump , probably pointing instead to a stellar atmospheres - based explanation (  6 ) ;    2 .",
    "fine tuning is also required in the helium mixing scenario _ at any given metallicity _ and _ for any given gc_. quantitative information in this respect can be obtained from detailed inspection of the plots published by sweigart ( 1997a , 1997b ) .",
    "figure  4 in sweigart ( 1997a ) is particularly relevant in this regard .",
    "this figure shows how the expected zahb temperature increases with increasing values of both reimers ( 1975a , 1975b ) mass loss parameter , @xmath53 , and the deep mixing depth , @xmath54 .",
    "thus in order to produce a jump at fixed @xmath8 an increase in the mixing extent must be compensated by a decrease in the mass loss parameter . at @xmath55 , which is very close to the empirical value for @xmath23 ( see table  1 ) , the following combinations ( @xmath54 ,  @xmath53 ) are found : ( 0.00 ,  0.52 ) ; ( 0.05 ,  0.46 ) ; ( 0.10 ,  0.40 ) ; ( 0.20 ,  0.30 ) .",
    "if we relax the fixed-@xmath8 constraint and keep instead not only the age , metallicity and original helium abundance , but also @xmath53 fixed ( which is the more natural assumption ) , a _ very _ large gap in @xmath12 results .",
    "figures 7 through 9 in sweigart ( 1997b ) show how the gravity - temperature plane is affected by the extent of helium mixing on the rgb . from those plots",
    "one can infer that the substantial increase in @xmath51 that would be required to reproduce the observed jump would lead to a gap in temperature encompassing several thousand degrees kelvin , besides leading to an increase in gravity ( and hence a _ decrease _ in luminosity ) .",
    "if some natural variation in @xmath53 is invoked , one would most likely expect  due to the widely suggested mixing - rotation connection  that @xmath53 should actually _ increase _ , and not decrease , with increasing mixing extent ( see , e.g. ,  6.2 in kraft et al .",
    "1995 ) , as opposed to what would be required to eliminate the gap .",
    "these perhaps surprising predictions of the helium - mixing scenario have no counterpart in either the @xmath2 ,  @xmath1 or the @xmath11 , @xmath12 diagrams , and demonstrate the high degree of fine tuning required for helium mixing to account for the jump phenomenon at a given metallicity and for any given gc .",
    "this may be called the _  local \" fine - tuning problem_not to be confused with the global , metallicity - related fine - tuning problem described above ;    3 .  without appealing to ad - hoc hypotheses ,",
    "the jump location _ and _ size should depend quite strongly ( in the helium mixing scenario ) on the extent of deep mixing on the rgb .",
    "however , gcs in which the rgb stars have undergone extreme deep mixing  such as m13present jump characteristics virtually identical to those of gcs whose giants seem to have undergone much less extensive deep mixing  such as ngc  288 ( see figs .",
    "1 , 3 , and 5 , and also table  1 ) ;    4 .  in a similar vein ,",
    "if deep mixing is related to stellar rotational velocity , and given that there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect rotational velocities at a given metallicity to be the same from one cluster to the next ( as supported by the observations of , e.g. , peterson , rood , & crocker 1995 and references therein ) , one would definitely expect large intrinsic scatter in @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and jump size at any given metallicity unless one resorts to ad - hoc hypotheses .",
    "while there _ does _ seem to be a perceptible difference in the jump temperature for m3 and m13 ( table  1)which might perhaps be related to the difference in hb rotational velocities between the two ( see  6)we note that the jump _ size _ appears very similar for all clusters ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "we shall present an alternative scenario to explain the jump phenomenon in  6 below .",
    "it is well known that rgb stars in the field do not show ( deep ) mixing patterns nearly as large as gc giants . since kraft et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , the literature has become very extensive in this regard : e.g. , sneden et al .",
    "( 1991 , 1997 ) ; kraft et al .  ( 1992 ) ; pilachowski et al .  ( 1996 ) ; shetrone ( 1996b ) ; hanson et al .",

    "( 1999b ) ; etc .",
    "if helium mixing is responsible for the jump , one would reach the conclusion that _ field bhb stars should not show any evidence for a jump in @xmath2 or @xmath11 _ similar to that seen amongst gcs .",
    "however , as can be seen from the @xmath11 ,  @xmath12 diagrams obtained by saffer et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1997 ) , and most recently by mitchell et al .",
    "( 1998 , their fig .  5 ) , cluster and field bhb stars are clearly closely related as far as the jump morphology goes .",
    "in fact , according to saffer ( 1998 )  the cluster and field bhb distributions in the @xmath11 ,  @xmath12 plane are completely consistent with one another . \"",
    "this implies that deep mixing is unlikely to be the primary cause for the jump phenomenon .    what is the evidence for a @xmath2jump among the field bhb stars ? in order to answer this question one should ideally have a sample of bhb stars with accurately determined distances and well calibrated strmgren photometry , such that their absolute magnitudes could be reliably derived and plotted in a @xmath56 $ ] diagram as for the clusters .",
    "however to the best of our knowledge a sample of bhb stars with accurately determined distances does not currently exist in the literature .",
    "thus at present we can not shed further light on the connection between the @xmath2- and @xmath11-jumps for field bhb stars .    whereas the _ overall _ field hb population is believed to contain only a small fraction of ehb stars ( @xmath57 ; saffer & liebert 1995 ; villeneuve et al .",
    "1995 ) , the _ halo _ field appears to contain a surprisingly large population of sdb ( or ehb ) stars , if compared to the disk field .",
    "mitchell ( 1998 ) estimates that  the metal - poor halo population can produce a horizontal - branch morphology that is , by a factor of @xmath58 [ @xmath59 lower limit ] , more heavily weighted toward the ` extreme ' blue end than the horizontal branch produced by the relatively metal - rich disk population \" . assuming mitchell s arguments to be correct , this , along with the lack of abundance anomalies among field metal - poor giants ,",
    "could imply that most halo ehb stars do not originate from deep mixing processes on the rgb evolutionary phase .",
    "this , of course , would _ not _ rule out the possibility that some ehb stars in some gcs  especially , of course , those showing extreme mixing patterns on the rgb  may indeed have undergone helium mixing during the rgb phase .",
    "more work is needed to verify mitchell s results .",
    "is the @xmath2-jump reported in this paper due to a deviation in the bolometric luminosity from canonical hb models , or is it due to a spectral peculiarity which makes the @xmath2 band brighter without changing the bolometric luminosity ? in principle , ultraviolet photometry can be used to answer this question because the stars hotter than the jump temperature emit most of their bolometric luminosity in the ultraviolet .",
    "for example , using the model atmosphere tabulation of lejeune , cuisinier , & buser ( 1997 ) , one finds that a star with @xmath60  k , @xmath61 , and @xmath34 } = -1.5 $ ] emits 73% of its bolometric luminosity shortward of 3000   .",
    "ultraviolet photometry of gcs has been obtained using both the ultraviolet imaging telescope ( stecher et al .",
    "1997 ) and the ultraviolet ( f160bw , f218w , f255w ) filters on wfpc2 ( e.g. , sosin et al .  1997 ; ferraro et al .",
    "the instruments are complementary in that the uit had a large ( @xmath62 diameter ) field of view , but a relatively coarse ( @xmath63 ) spatial resolution which made it mainly useful in the outer regions of the clusters , whereas the wfpc2 images have much better resolution ( 01 ) but can only record significant hb number counts in the cluster cores , due to its much smaller field of view .",
    "we note that the comparison of ultraviolet cmds with absolute theoretical luminosities can be problematic because the reddening correction is large , and the ultraviolet reddening law is known to show spatial variations in the galaxy ( fitzpatrick 1999 ) . in addition , uit had a calibration anomaly reminiscent of ( but not identical to ) reciprocity failure ( stecher et al . ) , while the absolute photometry using the wood s ( f160bw ) filter is limited by a high contamination rate ( whitmore , heyer , & baggett 1996 ) and a psf that varies across the field ( watson et al .",

    "note that this offset occurs at a @xmath72 color which is 0.75  mag bluer than would be predicted from the temperature ( @xmath73 ) of the jump found in the strmgren @xmath2  cmd .",
    "also note that this offset in the ultraviolet cmd is best described as an absence of stars near the zahb , since the majority of the stars are still contained within the same empirical upper envelope that fits stars at lower and higher temperatures_unlike the case with the @xmath2-jump and the @xmath11-jump_. thus , while there is some evidence for a luminosity offset in the ultraviolet cmd of m13 , it does not appear to be simply connected to the jump observed in the strmgren @xmath2   cmd .",
    "in conclusion , with the _ possible _ exception of m13 , the ultraviolet data show _ no _ evidence for a luminosity jump corresponding to the jump reported here for strmgren @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , m13 is the cluster for which the strongest evidence for deep mixing is currently available ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the strmgren @xmath2  bandpass is located just shortward of the balmer jump and thus the emergent flux is dominated by the hydrogen opacity .",
    "atmospheric effects ( related , e.g. , to an increase in the metal opacity ) that decrease the relative importance of the hydrogen opacity should result in a brighter strmgren @xmath2  flux . figure  7 shows how the flux in different bandpasses varies as a function of metallicity for kurucz models ( taken from lejeune et al .  1997 ) at three temperatures ( @xmath74  k , @xmath67  k , and @xmath75  k ) , which span the range of the strmgren @xmath2  jump . at all",

    "we thus suggest that the @xmath2-jump reported here , and its absence in the ultraviolet , is most likely due to radiative levitation of heavy elements to supra - solar abundances .",

    "the metal - rich model provides a much better fit than the model with the cluster metallicity .",
    "the metal - rich model also provides a somewhat better fit for temperatures hotter than the jump temperature in the ultraviolet cmd , where there is some evidence for a  negative jump \" to fainter ultraviolet luminosities . for temperatures cooler than the jump temperature , radiative levitation presumably does not occur .",
    "the sudden onset of the jump at a well - defined temperature , @xmath79  k , is possibly a result of the competition between the radiative levitation and nuclear ( hb ) timescales : radiation forces increase with @xmath8 so that it is conceivable that there is a  critical temperature \" above which radiative acceleration becomes effective in a time much shorter than the hb lifetime . between m3 and m13 (  3 ) , since it is well known that hb stars in m13 rotate significantly faster than their m3 counterparts ( peterson 1983 ; peterson et al .",
    "]    at the high temperatures ( @xmath80 ) and gravities of the sdb ( ehb ) stars , the metal - rich models in figure  8 are too bright in strmgren @xmath2 , which probably indicates that radiative levitation is no longer as effective .",
    "bergeron et al .  ( 1988 ) posited the existence of additional transport processes in sdb atmospheres , such as a weak stellar wind , to explain why silicon abundances were _ observed _ to be strikingly lower than predicted by radiative levitation models ( also see fontaine & chayer 1997 ) .",
    "studies of the pulsation modes in sdb stars suggest that radiative levitation of iron occurs in these stars ( charpinet et al .",
    "1997 ) , _ but _ not necessarily reaching the photosphere .",
    "an important caveat in the interpretation of figures  7 and 8 is that hot hb stars are known to have helium depletions ( e.g. , moehler et al .",
    "1995 , 1997 ) and ( as discussed below ) likely do _ not _ show significant enhancements of most of the light ( @xmath81 ) elements .",
    "both of these effects will somewhat reduce the brightening in strmgren @xmath2  predicted by the kurucz models , which use a solar helium abundance and solar - scaled metallicities .",
    "in addition , the predicted ultraviolet fluxes are uncertain if the important carbon and silicon opacity sources do not scale with the heavy metals .",
    "better predictions of the flux distribution in hot hb stars will most likely require the computation of model atmospheres with non - scaled solar abundances , for example , by use of the opacity - sampled atlas12 program ( kurucz 1993 ) .",
    "what is the evidence that significant radiative levitation of heavy elements occurs in hot hb stars ?",
    "first , we note that among the main - sequence b- and a - type stars , slow ( @xmath82 ) rotation appears to be a necessary condition for the appearance of abundance peculiarities ( wolff & preston 1978 ; abt & morrell 1995 ) .",
    "although @xmath83   measurements of hot hb stars are not yet available , observations of somewhat cooler bhb stars yield upper limits of @xmath84 , and no indication for an increase in @xmath83  with @xmath8 ( peterson et al .   1995 ; cohen & mccarthy 1997 ) .",
    "the observed helium depletions provide more direct evidence that chemical separation is possible in hot hb stars . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the calculations of radiative levitation and diffusion processes in hot hb stars by michaud , vauclair , & vauclair ( 1983 ) indicate that if the outer envelope is stable enough for the gravitational settling of helium to be efficient , then overabundances of heavy elements by factors of @xmath85 are expected .",
    "direct evidence for radiative levitation of heavy elements comes from the echelle spectroscopy of two hot hb stars in ngc  6752 by glaspey et al .",

    "an even more recent ( but less accurate ) spectroscopic analysis of bhb stars in ngc  6752 ( moehler et al . 1999 ) has also confirmed the enhanced fe ( but  normal \" mg ) pattern discussed in this section .",
    "] however , some additional guidance can be provided by high - dispersion analysis of helium - depleted field hb stars within the temperature range of the @xmath2-jump .",
    "table  2 shows the results of abundance analyses for the field hb stars feige 86 ( castelli , parthasaraty , & hack 1997 ) , pg  0954 + 049 , pg  1008 + 689 , pg  2301 + 259 ( hambly et al .",

    "in general , the hot hb stars show depletions of helium and the light elements ( with the exceptions of chlorine and phosphorous ) , but supra - solar abundances of iron and heavier elements . of course",
    ", one does not know the original abundances of the field hot hb stars , but observations of somewhat cooler field hb stars do suggest that they arise from a metal - poor population . for example , gray et al .  (",
    "1996 ) find that field hb stars between 7000  k and 9000  k are metal - poor ( less than @xmath34 } \\sim -1 $ ] ) and lie close to the zahb in the @xmath11 ,  @xmath12 diagram .",
    "as noted above , the abundances of most of the light metals in hot hb stars do not seem to show the same enhancement as the heavy metals .",
    "this effect can be understood in terms of two circumstances which preferentially favor saturation of the radiative forces in the light elements : the light metals generally have larger initial abundances and a less rich absorption spectrum ( a few strong lines rather than many weak lines ) than the heavy metals .",
    "the absence of overabundances in the light elements will make it difficult to detect the presence of radiative levitation in low - dispersion optical and ultraviolet spectra .",
    "the strongest lines in low - resolution optical spectra of hot hb stars are due to ions of the light elements such as , , and .",
    "similarly , in the ultraviolet the strongest lines are due to ions of the light elements , although in this case , one expects the continuum to be depressed by the presence of numerous weak iron - peak lines .",
    "such a depression of the far - uv continuum might have been seen by vink et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who analyzed a far - uv spectrum of m79 obtained with the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) .",
    "they suggest that the the agreement between their synthetic and the observed spectrum could be improved if the surface abundances of the hot hb stars in m79 were enhanced by radiative levitation .",
    "iue spectra of gc hb stars ( cacciari et al .",
    "1995 ) do not show any especially strong absorption features , and , in particular , do not show the strong photoionization resonances , which dramatically distort the far - ultraviolet continuum in the apsi stars ( lanz et al .",
    "thus , silicon is almost certainly not enhanced to suprasolar abundances in gc bhb stars .    as we have seen previously (  4 ) , the @xmath2-jump is strongly correlated with the @xmath11-jump . what is the effect of radiative levitation on the derived gravities of hot hb stars ?",
    "the gravities are derived by finding the gravity of a model ( of a given temperature and metallicity ) which best fits the balmer line profiles ( e.g. , saffer et al .",
    "1994 ; moehler et al .",
    ". the temperature must be either determined independently ( e.g. , from the ultraviolet continuum ) , or the gravity and temperature can be determined together from simultaneous fitting of multiple balmer lines .",
    "thus , to determine how radiative levitation of heavy elements can alter the derived gravity , one must also consider how the temperature is derived .",
    "this exercise was performed by moehler et al . , who compared derived gravities for hot hb stars in m15 using models with both solar and @xmath89 metallicity ( close to the cluster metallicity ) .",
    "they found that gravities could be underestimated by at most 0.1  dex if the hb stars had solar metallicities and metal - poor models were used to analyze them .",
    "they concluded that radiative levitation was insufficient to explain the size ( @xmath90  dex ) of their observed low gravity anomaly ( the @xmath11-jump ) .",
    "in fact , their exercise is consistent with our strmgren @xmath2  study in that it requires that heavy element abundances must be significantly _ above _ solar , in order for radiative levitation to be the origin of the anomaly .",
    "this statement is supported by the study of leone & manfr ( 1997 ) who , in their analysis of helium - weak stars , found that the derived @xmath11  value could be underestimated by up to 0.25  dex if a solar metallicity model were used to determine the gravity of helium - weak stars with a heavy metal abundance ten times solar .",
    "in addition to low gravities , the spectroscopic studies of de boer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and moehler et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1997 ) led to hb masses ( derived from values of the stellar @xmath8 , @xmath11 , @xmath0 magnitude , and the cluster distance ) significantly below canonical values .",
    "heber , moehler , & reid ( 1997 ) found that this discrepancy could be partially alleviated by use of the larger cluster distances indicated by some hipparcos studies ( e.g. , reid 1997 ; gratton et al .",
    "1997 ) , although the derived masses were still lower than canonical values for ngc  6397 and ngc  288 .",
    "the use of the long distance scale also led to absolute magnitudes brighter than canonical models , leading heber et al .  to favor non - canonical evolutionary models .",
    "however , if our hypothesis of radiative levitation is correct , then the derived masses must be considered uncertain at best , at least for hb stars in the  critical \" temperature range , @xmath91  k.    recently , caloi ( 1999 ) has also proposed that radiative levitation occurs in hot hb stars , mainly based on the suggested existence of a gap in the hb number counts in several gc cmds near @xmath92  mag . in principle , such gaps could be related to the `` jumps '' discussed in this paper ; for example , if a luminosity jump were much more prominent in @xmath69 than in @xmath0 , then a gap would appear at the location of the onset of the jump in a @xmath0 ,  @xmath9 diagram  but _ only if _ @xmath23 could be associated to a @xmath9 color along the  horizontal \" part of the hb .",
    "however , the temperature corresponding to @xmath93  mag is @xmath94  k , much cooler than the @xmath95  k found here for the onset of the strmgren @xmath2   jump .",
    "in addition , it appears that a gap at @xmath93  mag is not a _ ubiquitous _ phenomenon ( see , e.g. , the appendix in catelan et al .",
    "1998 ) , contrary to what might be expected in caloi s scenario .",
    "finally , we also note that our @xmath2 ,  @xmath4 data for m68 ( ngc  4590 ) from eso do not show clear evidence for a @xmath2-jump because its _ hottest _ bhb stars are close to the temperature limit for the onset of the jump . in summary",
    ", it is unlikely that the gaps discussed by caloi are related to the jump discussed in this paper , although the connection between hb gaps and atmosphere effects merits further investigation .    to summarize",
    ", radiative levitation of heavy elements can plausibly explain the temperature range and magnitude of both the @xmath2- and @xmath11-jump as well as the low - mass problem , but further high - resolution optical and ultraviolet spectra are needed to demonstrate that the abundances of iron and other heavy elements are significantly above solar . as part of this effort , we have a current hst cycle  8 program ( go-8256 ) to obtain stis ultraviolet spectra of nine hb stars in ngc  6752 which span the temperature range of the jump .",
    "also needed are model atmospheres with non - scaled solar abundances ( computed , e.g. , with the atlas12 code ) to determine quantitatively whether the observed strmgren @xmath2   and gravity anomalies can be entirely explained by overabundances of heavy elements or whether additional effects such as those discussed in  5 ( i.e. , helium mixing ) are required . in this regard , we issue a cautionary remark on attempts to calibrate the free parameters of the helium - mixing theory ( which is not a  first - principles \" theory ) using the @xmath2- and @xmath11-jump properties : before this task can be successfully accomplished , the effects of radiative levitation upon the adopted model atmospheres must be taken into account .    finally , we note that there have been no theoretical studies of diffusion processes in hot hb stars since the work of michaud et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , and that much more sophisticated calculations of radiative accelerations are now possible ( e.g. , richer et al .  1998 ) .",
    "in the present paper , we have carried out an extensive analysis of the grundahl et al .",
    "( 1998 )  jump \" in strmgren @xmath2 first detected in m13 . with this purpose",
    ", we presented new @xmath2 ,  @xmath4 photometry of fourteen gcs based on four filter / detector combinations .      1 .",
    "the strmgren @xmath2  jump is a ubiquitous feature , present in every metal - poor gc with sufficiently hot bhb stars .",
    "such a jump is morphologically best described as a systematic deviation , in @xmath2 magnitudes and/or @xmath1 colors , with respect to the expectations of canonical zahb models , in the sense that the observations appear brighter and/or hotter than the theoretical predictions ;    2 .",
    "the parameter that best defines the onset of the jump is its temperature , which we find to be remarkably constant from one cluster to the next : @xmath96  k ; the error estimate is essentially due to measurement and/or calibration uncertainties .",
    "we do not find any significant evidence for a dependence of @xmath23 on metallicity .",
    "the high - temperature end of the jump appears to be situated at @xmath97  k ;    3 .  the occurrence of the jump is not related to the gc metallicity , central concentration , central density , extent of mixing on the rgb , hb morphology ( provided the ",
    "critical \" temperature @xmath23 is reached by the cluster s bhb ) , or galactocentric distance ;        recently , a non - canonical evolutionary scenario ( helium mixing : sweigart 1997a , 1997b ) has been proposed as a possible explanation for the low bhb gravities ( @xmath11-jump)which , as we have just remarked , seems strongly connected to the @xmath2-jump . from our discussion , we were able to pose the following constraints on this scenario :    1 .",
    "_  global \" fine - tuning problem _ : given the strong dependence of zahb properties upon variations in gc evolutionary parameters , one would naturally expect some intrinsic relationship between @xmath23 and [ fe / h ] .",
    "however , any intrinsic relationship between these two quantities , if present at all , seems to be quite mild  posing , in fact , a major challenge for _ any _ stellar evolution - related scenario for the occurrence of the jump , and pointing instead to a stellar atmospheres - based solution ;    2 .  _  local \" fine - tuning problem _ : ( extreme ) fine tuning is also required in the helium mixing scenario _ at any given metallicity _ and _ for any given gc _ in order for @xmath2- and @xmath11-jumps such as the ones observed to be reproduced by the non - canonical models ;    3 .",
    "helium mixing theory predicts that the jump size and location should depend quite strongly on the extent of deep mixing on the rgb .",
    "however , gcs in which the rgb stars have undergone extreme deep mixing  such as m13present jump characteristics virtually identical to those of gcs whose giants seem to have undergone little mixing  such as ngc  288 ;    4 .",
    "if ( as commonly assumed ) deep mixing on the rgb is related to stellar rotational velocity , current measurements of hb rotational velocities ( peterson et al .",
    "1995 ) would lead one to expect ( perhaps large ) intrinsic scatter in @xmath23 _ and _ jump size at any given metallicity ",
    "contrary to what our observations appear to suggest ;    5 .",
    "the jump phenomenon ( at least in @xmath11 ) is present not only among gc bhb stars , but also in the field ( e.g. , mitchell et al .",
    "1998 ) . since it is well known that rgb stars in the field do not show deep mixing patterns nearly as large as gc giants ( e.g. , hanson et al .  1998 ; carretta et al .",
    "1999b ; kraft 1998 , 1999 ) , their progeny must clearly not have undergone helium mixing .",
    "this provides strong indication that deep mixing can not be responsible for the jump phenomenon .",
    "in addition , it may also imply that ( most ) ehb ( sdb ) stars in the _ halo _ field ( mitchell 1998 ) , and possibly also in gcs , can not have their origin ascribed to helium mixing on the rgb ;    6 .  with the _ possible _ exception of m13 ,",
    "the jump phenomenon is _ not _ seen in ultraviolet cmds , and thus does _ not _ appear to be caused by a jump in the bolometric luminosity  contrary to what would be expected in the helium - mixing scenario .",
    "these observations suggest that a stellar atmosphere effect , rather than helium mixing , is the primary cause of the @xmath2- and @xmath11-jump phenomenon . _",
    "we propose here that radiative levitation of metals might be able to explain all aspects of the jump problem .",
    "_ this suggestion , which requires further development on the basis of new observations and diffusion / model atmosphere computations , is in essence based on the following main lines of evidence :    1 .",
    "the temperature range of the jump is similar to that found for the chemically peculiar ( hg - mn and helium - weak ) b - type stars , which show helium depletions and large overabundances of heavy elements . observations of ( somewhat cooler ) bhb stars show them to be slow ( @xmath98 ) rotators ( peterson et al .",
    "1995 ; cohen & mccarthy 1997 ) , and slow rotation ( @xmath82 ) seems to be a necessary condition for the appearance of overabundances in the b - type stars ( wolff & preston 1978 ) .",
    "the helium depletions observed in the hot hb stars ( moehler et al .",
    "1995 ) show that chemical separation is feasible in these stars",
    ". theoretical considerations ( michaud et al .  1983 ) suggest that if an hb atmosphere is stable enough to show helium depletion , then overabundances of heavy metals by factors of @xmath85 might be expected ;    2 .",
    "an abundance analysis derived from echelle spectra of the star cl  1083 ( @xmath8  @xmath99  k ) in ngc  6752 yielded an overabundance of iron by a factor of 50 ( glaspey et al .",
    "1989 ) and observations of field hb stars within the temperature range of the jump consistently show an overabundance of iron - peak and heavier metals ( table  2 ) ;    3 .",
    "simple experiments with kurucz model atmospheres suggest that an increase of the metallicity to suprasolar abundances can lead to 0.3  mag brightening of the strmgren @xmath2  flux , with little change or a decrease in the ultraviolet flux .",
    "the work of leone & manfr ( 1997 ) suggests that an underestimate of the gravity by as much as 0.25  dex might result if super metal - rich spectra were analyzed using models with the cluster metallicity .",
    "this implies that efforts to employ @xmath2 ,  @xmath4 or @xmath11 ,  @xmath12 diagrams to constrain non - canonical evolutionary models can not be reliably carried out until the effects of radiative levitation upon the adopted model atmospheres have been properly taken into account .        2 .",
    "even @xmath43  cen will show a well - defined jump in @xmath2 and in @xmath11 , in spite of its large intrinsic spread in metallicity ( by @xmath100  dex : e.g. , norris , freeman , & mighell 1996 ; suntzeff & kraft 1996 ) .",
    "moreover , the low - temperature cutoff of the jump is predicted to be located at the same place in both @xmath43  cen and ngc  288 ( i.e. , @xmath96  k ) , in spite of the dramatic differences in mixing history between the two globulars ( @xmath43  cen : norris & da costa 1995a , 1995b ; zucker , wallerstein , & brown 1996 ; ngc  288 : see table  1 ) ;    3 .  any bona - fide bhb star  whether in gcs or in the field  lying in the critical temperature range @xmath91",
    "k , will lie above the canonical zahb loci in the @xmath2 ,  @xmath1 and @xmath11 ,  @xmath12 planes ;    4",
    ".  the radiative levitation hypothesis will be easily falsifiable , once additional echelle spectra of cluster hot hb stars have been obtained .",
    "( this project is feasible for the nearest gcs using the coming generation of 8-m and larger telescopes . )",
    "should the derived iron abundances not be consistently above solar , then an alternative explanation will be required for the @xmath2- and @xmath11-jump phenomenon .",
    "on the other hand , if the suprasolar iron abundances are confirmed , then metal - rich model atmospheres ( with non - solar - scaled abundances ) must be constructed to derive the fundamental stellar parameters .",
    "our gc sample is comprised of inner - halo clusters only .",
    "( for the hb morphology - independent definition of  outer halo , \" the reader is referred to  7 in borissova et al .",

    "1999)and in bulge gcs with blue hbs ( ortolani , barbuy , & bica 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "as pointed out in  5 , there seems to be a significant correlation between deep - mixing signatures on the rgb of gcs and hb morphology .",
    "_ if _ helium mixing should turn out not to be the cause , whence this correlation ?",
    "one possibility is that non - canonical mixing on the rgb is related to mass loss ( through stellar rotation ? ) .",
    "this idea has tentavile been raised by catelan & de freitas pacheco ( 1995 ) and kraft et al .",

    "this is obviously a very surprising result : where are the rgb progenitors of such bhb stars in m13 ? could the discrepancy be related , at least in part , to langer s ( 1991 ) mass loss scenario , whereby ( some ) rgb stars might appear more oxygen - poor than they actually are due to forbidden emission from an extensive , cool , slowly expanding outer envelope  possibly implying somewhat enhanced mass loss rates ?",
