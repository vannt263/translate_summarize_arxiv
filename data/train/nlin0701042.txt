    "such @xmath78 interferogram ( fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] ) contains additional array of vortices with alternative charges .",
    "the net angular momentum tends to be close to zero , because at the central part of array each positively directed tc @xmath71 is compensated by four adjaicent negative ones having charge @xmath79 .",

    "hence the probability distribution @xmath92 of finding atom some near the point @xmath93 at the moment @xmath94 is similar to the intensity distribution of trapping field as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "more information could be obtained from the study of phase structure of wavefunction and comparison of topological charges of trapping field and bec vortex .",
    "it is easy to realize using madelung transform @xmath95 that there exists flow of `` probability fluid '' with velocity @xmath96 proportional ( parallel ) to the phase gradient lines : @xmath97    such `` flow of wavefunction '' occurs around the @xmath64-axis ( beam axis ) .",
    "the `` flow '' described by ( [ lg ] ) is potential and conservative as it should be for superfluid .",
    "this picture is complicated by vorticity of em - momentum , inherent to lg - beams @xcite . strictly speaking the rotation of classical dipole around core",
    "is accelerated by nonconservative torque induced by azimuthal force circulating around vortex core . for two - level atom the value of torque @xmath98",
    "is given by following expression obtained by babiker , power and allen @xcite :    @xmath99\\ ] ]    where @xmath100 - normalized trapping filed intesity , @xmath101 - detuning of trapping field frequency @xmath102 from resonant frequency @xmath103 of dipole . in saturation limit @xmath98 is simply : @xmath3 . in nonresonant case",

    "@xmath107 the @xmath108-line dublett of @xmath109 with linewidth @xmath110 @xcite the torque is reduced by factor depending on laser intensity @xmath100 .thus due to trade - off between the saturation and detuning the torque exists both near and at large detuning from the resonance .",
    "consequently the loop integral of the azymuthal force over circular trajectory around core @xmath111 is nonzero ( fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] ) .    in classical picture because of this torque the dipole placed in the doughnut beam will move `` upwards '' the helicoidal phase staircase , i.e. it will rotate around lg - beam axis .",
    "the direction of rotation is determined by topological charge @xmath71 of the trapping beam ( fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] ) .",
    "qualitatively classical dipole is pushed by azimutally periodic electric field - it happens because the phase of electric field oscillations at each point in circle around the center of beam is shifted with respect to neighbouring points .",
    "thus classical dipole placed at maximum of intensity of gl - beam will feel the `` plane - wave - like '' nonresonant pressure of light field .",
    "the associated azimuthal doppler shift of the moving atom was observed experimentally recently @xcite . outside the resonance",
    "the origin of torque @xmath98 is interpreted in similar way : the pointing vector has component @xmath112 tangent to helix and local flux of electromagnetic momentum pushes dipole along phase gradient , i.e. in azimuthal direction . the local density of em - momentum @xmath113 is proportional to components of pointing vector@xcite : @xmath114 where @xmath115 - is tangential component of pointing vector , @xmath116 - is axial one , @xmath117 - is the distance from optical vortex core , @xmath118 - is frequency of trapping field .",
    "the existence of tangential component of pointing vector became visible when macroscopic dielectric ball with radius larger than lg - beam core and comparable to `` doughnut '' radius is placed in center of lg - beam .",
    "the rotation of particle is induced via such torque and corresponding transfer of the angular momentum@xcite .    when loaded in optical vortex lattice ( fig .",
    "[ fig.5])the atomic dipole will move around the adjaicent vortex core with acceleration .",
    "the radius of rotation will increase until the dipole will approach the separatrice of the velocity fields.next after certain amount of rotations around the vortex core it could jump to another vortex using bright areas between vortices as bridge ( fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] ) .",
    "this qualitative picture is complicated by azimuthally inhomogeneous distribution of intensity around each core .",
    "our aim now is to show that just described classical motion have quantum mechanical counterpart . the transfer of angular momentum results in the specific form of macroscopic wavefunction @xmath11 maintaining coherence all over trapping array : @xmath119.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    next section presents the method of solution of gross - pitaevsky equation with vortex trapping field @xmath120 in the form ( [ hold_vort ] ) .",
    "in order to get closed form solution for macroscopic @xmath11 it is worth to mention that azimuthal accelerating force has very small value , falling as @xmath121 under detuning from resonance@xcite .",
    "next let us introduce optical potential @xmath122 as a square modulus of trapping field @xmath123@xcite .",
    "the torque @xmath98 will be taken into account as a `` selection '' rule for choosing distribution of topological charges @xmath124 in resulting solution .",
    "it was shown recently @xcite that gross - pitaevsky equation@xcite in 3d - configuration : @xmath125 admits the application of standard method of separation of variables widely used for solution of @xmath126 partial differential equation , e.g. in quantum mechanics .",
    "the separation of variables means that wavefunction is factorized :    @xmath127    provided the hamiltonian is the sum of two components .",
    "first component depends on a longitudinal variable @xmath64 and a second component depends upon transverse variables @xmath128 .",
    "following to @xcite in order to separate variables and factorize the wavefunction let us choose trapping potential in the following form , as a sum of components depending on longitudinal coordinate @xmath64 and transverse coordinates @xmath128 separately :    @xmath129 { \\ : } } |{e}(\\vec{r}_{\\bot } ) |{\\:}^2 & + &     \\nonumber \\\\ + { \\frac { m{\\ : } { \\omega{_{\\bot}}}^2 { | ( \\vec{r}_{\\bot } ) |{\\:}^2   } } { 2 } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath130 is atomic polarizability@xcite :    @xmath131    the @xmath130 is assumed to be real due to large negative ( `` red '' ) detuning from atomic resonance at frequency @xmath132hz .",
    "the imaginary part of denominator under detuning @xmath101 for @xmath109 atoms trapped by em - field at @xmath133 is @xmath134 times smaller than real part , so the permittivity of atom @xmath130 is real with good accuracy @xcite .",

    "this solution proved to be stable with respect to small harmonic perturbations .",
    "each sfv carries angular momentum @xmath171 per particle and rotational kinetic energy @xmath190 , @xmath191 - diameter of vortex core , @xmath192 - interatomic distance , @xmath193 - length of vortex which is roughly equal to thickness of `` pancake '' @xcite .",
    "the energy associated with superfluid vortices is of order @xmath194 or @xmath195 at density of dilute @xmath177 gas @xmath196 .",
    "in contrast to superfluid in rotating bucket where angular momenta of vortices are co - directed @xcite , the bec vortices trapped by optical vortex array are counter - directed from site to site .",
    "consequently in the net sum of angular momenta each vortice of positive topological charge is compensated by the term with negative charge and total angular momentum tends to zero .",
    "nevertheless the mutual subtraction of angular momenta(vectorial ) of adjaicent vortices in the net sum does not mean the mutual subtraction of rotational energies , which are the positive scalars .",
    "the ground state carry substantial amount of rotational kinetic energy of condensate which contains @xmath197 particles of mass @xmath88 per unite volume , namely @xmath198 .",
    "the optical vortex arrays emitted by solid - state microchip laser were analysed from the point of view of application to optical dipole traps .",
    "firstly the numerical modeling of thin slice microchip fabry - perot solid - state laser resonator gave transverse field distributions(fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] ) well correlated with experimentally observed previously .",
    "the longitudinal intensity distribution consists of periodically spaced array of parallel hollow tubes which slowly diverge while propagating along @xmath64-axis(fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] ) .",
    "the array of phase - locked gaussian - laquerre beams equispaced at the nodes of rectangular lattice proved to be a reasonable approximation for experimental and numerical results as well .    for macroscopic wavefunction @xmath11 of bec trapped in such complex optical field the analytical solutions of gross - pitaevsky equation were found .",
    "these solutions are based upon separation of variables and mutual compensation of vortex component of external trapping field via nonlinear term of gpe .",
    "the obtained wavefunctions have perfect correlation with trapping field , including distribution of topological charges , which form `` antiferromagnetic - like '' lattice . within framework of this particular model the `` antiferromagnetic '' lattice of bec vortices carriers",
    "total angular momentum close to zero while net rotational kinetic energy of sfv lattice tends to be equal to the sum of rotational energies of vortices .",
    "geometrically such bec - cloud looks like `` pancake '' perpendicular to @xmath64-axis .",
    "the field of classical velocities , i.e. the field of phase gradients , obtained via madelung transform , forms `` labyrinth '' structure .",
    "it means that trapped atoms move in the `` pancake '' plane , i.e. @xmath199 plane.the rotation of atom around some vortex core is accelerated by em - torque .",
    "the radius of rotation is gradually increased . when particle reaches the separatrice it comes to another vortex area .",
    "the trajectory of particle in transverse plane ( @xmath199 plane ) is mobius - like : because the number of optical vortices is finite , in classical picture the particle will return to initial vortex eventually after roaming for some time inside trapping `` labyrinth '' .    in quantum picture represented via analytic solution of gpe for one trapping vortex and numerical solution for optical vortex array",
    "the coherent macroscopic wavefunction extends all over ov trapping array with transverse spatial dimension of several hundred microns .",
    "the complex field of velocities , rotational energy and high degree of correlation of sfv wavefunction with ov trapping field promise more resistance to decoherence .",
    "the qualitative analytic solution supports the basic feature related to trapping of macroscopic particles and to bec trapping : the transfer of oam from optical field to superfluid .",
    "the proposed ova trap might be interesting from the point of view of studies of quantum - classical correspondence .",
    "the mechanism of imposing the topological charges to bec vortices by means of manipulating the vorticity of trapping optical array could result in demonstration of macroscopic quantum interference phenomena .",
    "evidently there are 4 possible topologically equivalent combinations of parameters of solution ( [ lg_array ] ) of ov charges ( @xmath200 ) and their relative phases ( @xmath201 ) .",
    "thus there exist 4 wavefunctions @xmath11 having an indentical probabability @xmath202 distribution and different orientation of sfl vortices with respect to physical axes @xmath203 of trapping setup , characterised by @xmath204 and their relative phases .",
    "the transformation of the one @xmath11 into another one which have different phase structure is equivalent to @xmath205 rotation around @xmath64 - axis .",
