    "strontium ruthenate , sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 , is according to theoretical predictions the best candidate to date to host @xmath0-wave superconductivity . generally speaking , the order parameter in superconductors describes the spatial profile of the gap function , @xmath3 .",
    "the order parameter in @xmath0-wave superconductivity is an odd function of the wave vector @xmath4 , unlike the s - wave superconductors where it is an even function of @xmath4 .",

    "microscopic calculation of the superconducting gap is a highly demanding task that requires a detailed knowledge of the pairing mechanism which in many cases is not available .",
    "what remains then is to exploit all the symmetries ( continuous and discrete ) exhibited by the material under consideration and build a model that will depend on certain number of parameters .",
    "the possible superconducting order parameters that have been reported for @xmath0-wave superconductors required a detailed description of the crystal structure of the considered material .",
    "@xcite in that respect , strontium ruthenate ( sro ) is a layered perovskite with a crystal structure similar to the well known high - t@xmath9 superconductor ( la , sr)@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , where oxygen ions at the corners of an octahedron surround the body - centered ru ion .",
    "@xcite the planar layers of ruo@xmath1 are separated by sr layers that stack along the highly symmetric axis @xmath10 .",
    "the fermi surface of strontium ruthenate contains three sheets arising from the binding of the ru and o ions within the same layer .",
    "bindings between the ruo@xmath1 layers are weak due to the long separation of the interplanar ruo@xmath11 octahedra . the fermi sheets @xmath12 and @xmath13 are both one dimensional ( 1d ) , while the @xmath14 sheet is two dimensional ( 2d ) . for sufficiently high fields along the @xmath10 direction ,",
    "the zeeman splitting between electrons with opposite spins demands vector @xmath7 to lie in the ruo@xmath1 layer or the basal plane , @xcite i.e @xmath15 .",

    ", there is one which is 2d and consequently breaking time - reversal symmetry .",
    "@xcite this representation is suitable for strontium ruthenate since muon - spin relaxation ( @xmath17sr ) measurements detected spontaneous magnetization below its superconducting critical temperature , @xmath18 k , @xcite fitting well to what was predicted in a formalism where the superconducting order parameter has at least two components .",

    "@xcite similarly , in mesoscopic chiral @xmath0-wave superconductors hqvs have been predicted to exist , owing the reduction of their otherwise divergent energy to the low dimensionality of the system .",
    "@xcite we found these hqv states in multiple forms , but also fv and skyrmionic states and transitions between them as a function of the external magnetic field applied perpendicularly to the sample .",

    "@xcite nevertheless , many works have failed to convincingly detect spontaneous currents , half - quantum vortices and skyrmions in large samples .",
