    "recently , much attention has been paid to the formation of small bubbles , sometimes called nanobubbles , in water @xcite .",
    "they have been observed with a dissolved gas on hydrophobic surfaces @xcite and in bulk @xcite in ambient conditions ( around @xmath5 k and 1 atm ) , where the pressure in the bulk liquid region is larger than the saturated vapor pressure @xmath1 or outside the coexisting curve ( cx ) .",
    "their typical radius @xmath4 is of order @xmath6 nm and their life time is very long .",
    "the interior pressure is given by @xmath730 atm for a bubble with @xmath8 nm from the laplace law , where @xmath9 is the surface tension equal to @xmath10 erg@xmath11@xmath12 .",
    "strong attractive forces have also been measured between hydrophobic walls in water due to bubble bridging @xcite .",
    "these effects are important in various applications , but the underlying physics has not yet been well understood .    in this paper , we ascribe the origin of bubble formation to a hydrophobic interaction between water and solute @xcite . in our theory , the solute - induced phase separation generally occurs in equilibrium when the solvent is in a liquid state outside cx and the solute - solvent interaction is repulsive .",
    "most crucial in our theory is the solvation chemical potential of the solute @xmath13 depending on the solvent density @xmath14 and the temperature @xmath15 . with increasing such a repulsion , its difference @xmath16 between the liquid and gas phases can be considerably larger than the thermal energy @xmath17 ( per solute particle ) .",
    "in this situation , the solute molecules are repelled from the liquid to form domains of a new phase ( in gas , liquid , or solid ) .",
    "supposing bubbles with a small volume fraction @xmath3 , we set up a free energy @xmath2 accounting for considerably large @xmath18 .",
    "then , its minimization with respect to @xmath3 and the interior solute density @xmath19 yields the equilibrium conditions of bubbles in liquid ( those of chemical equilibrium and pressure balance ) .    as a bubble - forming solute in water ,",
    "we treat o@xmath0 , which is mildly hydrophobic with @xmath20 on cx at @xmath21 k. furthermore , the critical temperature and pressure of water and o@xmath0 are given by @xmath22 k , 22.12 mpa ) and ( @xmath23 k , @xmath24 mpa ) , respectively .",
    "notice that the critical temperature of water is much higher than that of o@xmath0 ( and than those of n@xmath0 , h@xmath0 , and ar etc ) due to the hydrogen bonding in water . as a result",
    ", no gas - liquid phase transition takes place within bubbles composed mostly of o@xmath0 in liquid water in ambient conditions .",
    "in contrast , strongly hydrophobic solutes usually form solid aggregates in liquid water except for very small solute densities @xcite .    in our theory",
    ", solute - induced bubbles can appear outside cx only when the solute density exceeds a threshold density , where the threshold tends to zero as the liquid pressure approaches @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , above the threshold density , a surface bubble ( a gas film ) appears on a hydrophobic wall in the temperature range @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) . as is well known ,",
    "this is possible only on cx without solute ( in one - component fluids ) . here",
    ", @xmath27 is the drying temperature @xcite determined by the solvent - wall interaction , so it is insensitive to a small amount of solute with mild @xmath16 . with a solute below the threshold density , we predict only a microsopically depleted layer outside cx ( as in one - component fluids ) .",
    "indeed , some groups @xcite detected only microscopic depletion layers on a hydrophobic wall with a dissolved gas , while other groups observed surface bubbles @xcite .    on the other hand , to prepare stable bulk bubbles , macroscopic gas bubbles composed of o@xmath0 etc .",
    "have been fragmented by stirring in liquid water @xcite . in such measurements ,",
    "ohgaki et al.@xcite realized bubbles with @xmath28 nm in quasi - steady states , where the bubble density was @xmath29m@xmath30 and the bubble volume fraction was @xmath31 .",
    "we shall see that the nucleation barrier of creating solute - induced bulk bubbles in quiescent states is too high for nucleation experiments for a gas such as o@xmath0 except for very high liquid pressures .    as a similar bulk phenomenon , long - lived heterogeneities",
    "have also been observed in one - phase states of aqueous mixtures with addition of a salt or a hydrophobic solute @xcite .",
    "dynamic light scattering experiments indicated that their typical size is of order @xmath32 nm .",
    "theoretically , such a phase separation can occur if the solute - solvent interaction is highly preferential between the two solvent components @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we will present a thermodynamic theory of bubbles induced by a small amount of solute , where the liquid pressure and the total solvent and solute numbers are fixed . in sec.iii",
    ", we will set up a bubble free energy @xmath2 .",
    "in sec.iv , we will examine solute - induced nucleation .",
    "in addition , in sec.iiic and appendix",
    "a , we will briefly examine bubble formation at fixed chemical potentials and at fixed cell volume .",
    "we consider a one - component solvent , called water , in a liquid state outside the coexistence curve ( cx ) .",
    "we then add a small amount of a neutral , hydrophobic solute ( impurities ) .",
    "the total solvent and solute numbers are fixed at @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , with @xmath35 and @xmath36 being the initial water and solute densities . here",
    ", @xmath37 is larger than the liquid density @xmath38 on cx before bubble formation .",
    "we keep the pressure in the liquid region at the initial value @xmath39 larger than the saturated vapor ( coexistence ) pressure @xmath1 by attaching a pressure valve to the cell , as illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "we do not assume the presence of surfactants and ions ( see remarks in sec.iva ) .",
    "we assume that the molecular volume of solute @xmath40 is of the same order as that of solvent @xmath41 , since large hydrophobic impurities tend to form solid precipitates @xcite .",
    "we then consider the helmholtz free energy density @xmath42 depending on the water density @xmath14 and the solute density @xmath43 in the dilute limit of solute . in this paper , we neglect the solute - solute interaction to obtain f(n , n_i ) = f_w ( n ) + k_b tn_i [ ( n_i v_i ) -1 + _",

    "hereafter , the @xmath15-dependence of the physical quantities will not be written explicitly .",

    "thus , @xmath51 may be chosen to be independent of @xmath14 without loss of generality .",
    "it is known that the entropic contribution to @xmath52 is crucial for nonpolar impurities in liquid water @xcite .    from eq.(1 )",

    ". the typical size of @xmath56 is of the order of the solute molecular volume @xmath40 . in the presence of bubbles , @xmath53 and",
    "@xmath54 take common values in gas and liquid , while the pressure in the bubbles is higher than that in the liquid by @xmath57 .",
    "first , the homogeneity of @xmath54 in equilibrium yields n_i = n_i^0 , as a function of @xmath14 in two - phase states , where @xmath58 is a constant . in gas - liquid coexistence , let the water and solute densities be @xmath59 and @xmath60 in gas and be @xmath61 and @xmath62 in liquid , respectively .",
    "then , eq . ( 7 ) gives / n_i= , where the @xmath63 .",
    "this density ratio is called the ostwald coefficient , which represents solubility of a gas @xcite .",

    "s(n_cx^)-_s(n_cx^g ) , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the liquid and gas densities on cx of pure water .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath64 in eq.(9 ) is related to the henry constant @xmath67@xcite . from partitioning of a solute between coexisting gas and liquid ,",
    "it is defined by k_h= k_bt n_i/=k_btn_cx^ ( _ s ) , where @xmath68 is the solute partial pressure in gas and @xmath69 is the solute molar fraction in liquid . in water in the ambient conditions , @xmath64 is @xmath70 for o@xmath0 , @xmath71 for n@xmath0 , and 0.18 for co@xmath0 , where co@xmath0 is highly soluble in liquid water .",
    "thus , our theory is not applicable to co@xmath0 .",
    "however , there are a variety of solutes with stronger hydrophobicity@xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath72 for pentacosane .",
    "in addition , from numerical simulations , a neutral hard - sphere particle deforms the surrounding hydrogen bonding ; as a result , @xmath73 for @xmath74 nm and @xmath75 for @xmath76 nm with varying the particle radius @xmath77 @xcite .",

    "since the total solvent and solute numbers are fixed , the densities in the liquid are given by & & =    & & n_i=|n_i- _ i hereafter , we set @xmath83 .",
    "we also have @xmath84 from @xmath85 .",

    "the fraction of the solute in the bubbles is given by = n_i/|n_i= /[+ ( -_s ) ] , which tends to 1 for @xmath86 .",

    "<S> it becomes a function of the bubble radius @xmath4 under the laplace pressure balance . </S>",
    "<S> then , for sufficiently large solute densities above a threshold , @xmath2 exhibits a local maximum at a critical radius and a minimum at an equilibrium radius . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine solute - induced nucleation taking place outside cx , where bubbles larger than the critical radius grow until attainment of equilibrium . </S>"
