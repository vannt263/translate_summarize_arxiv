    "our aim in this paper is to study the _ boundary of hyperbolicity _ of certain families of two dimensional maps .",
    "we say that a family of @xmath2 plane diffeomorphisms is called a _",
    "hnon - like family _ if it can be written in the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 is a @xmath0 `` perturbation '' of the standard _",
    "hnon family _",
    "@xcite satisfying @xmath8 in this paper we consider @xmath9 fixed sufficiently small and investigate the dynamics as the parameter @xmath10 is varied . for simplicity we shall therefore omit @xmath11 and @xmath12 from the notation and denote a hnon - like family by @xmath13 . for future reference",
    "we remark that the inverse of @xmath14 is given by an equation of a similar form : @xmath15 where @xmath16 as @xmath17 .",
    "we shall suppose without loss of generality that @xmath18        hnon and hnon - like families have been extensively studied over the last almost 30 years .",
    "one of the earliest rigorous results on the subject is @xcite in which it was shown that the non - wandering set @xmath19 is uniformly hyperbolic for all @xmath20 and all sufficiently large @xmath10 ( depending on @xmath21 ) . on the other hand , for small @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    "there exists positive probability of `` strange attractors '' which contain tangencies between stable and unstable leaves .",
    "this was first proved in @xcite for the hnon family and later generalized in @xcite to hnon - like families , see also @xcite .",
    "these attractors can not be uniformly hyperbolic due to the presence of tangencies but turn out to satisfy weaker _ nonuniform _ hyperbolicity conditions @xcite .",
    "more recently bedford and smillie have described the transition between these two regimes for hnon families by identifying and describing some of the properties of the _ boundary of uniform hyperbolicity _ @xcite . in particular",
    "they show that for small @xmath24 , the nonwandering set is uniformly hyperbolic up until the first parameter @xmath10 at which a tangency occurs between certain stable and unstable manifolds . combining this with the statements contained in @xcite",
    "their results also imply uniform bounds on the lyapunov exponents of all invariant probability measures at the bifurcation parameter @xcite .",
    "their methods rely crucially on previous work @xcite which in turn is based on the polynomial nature of the hnon family , a feature which allows them to consider its complexification and to apply original and highly sophisticated arguments of holomorphic dynamics .      in this paper",
    "we develop a new and completely different strategy to the problem , based purely on geometric `` real '' arguments , which have the advantage of applying to general @xmath0 _ hnon - like _ families .",
    "we also obtain the analogous _ uniformity _ results by showing that the hyperbolicity expansion and contraction rates are uniform right up to the point of tangency and that even _ at _ the point of tangency some strong version of nonuniform hyperbolicity continues to hold : all lyapunov exponents of all invariant measures are uniformly bounded away from 0 .",
    "for all @xmath25 and @xmath26 sufficiently small we have the following property .",
    "for every hnon - like family @xmath27 of plane diffeomorphisms there exists a unique @xmath28 such that    1 .   for all @xmath29 the nonwandering set",
    "@xmath30 is uniformly hyperbolic ; 2 .   for @xmath31",
    "the nonwandering set @xmath32 contains an orbit of tangency but is `` almost uniformly hyperbolic '' in the sense that all lyapunov exponents of all invariant probability measures supported on @xmath33 are uniformly bounded away from 0",
    ".    moreover , the bounds on the expansion and contraction rates for all @xmath34 are independent of @xmath10 and of the family .",
    "we remark that this is not the only existing definition of hnon - like in the literature .",
    "one standard approach is to consider `` singular '' perturbations of the limiting one - dimensional map corresponding to the case @xmath35 : @xmath36 this formulation however has some slight technical issues .",
    "for example , one can not assume that @xmath37 is small on all of @xmath38 since that would violate the requirement that @xmath39 be a global diffeomorphism of @xmath1 .",
    "this can be dealt with by restricting our attention to some compact region , say @xmath40 \\times [ -2,2 ] $ ] , and supposing only that @xmath41 in this region .",
    "our arguments apply in this case also and yield a more local result on the hyperbolicity of the nonwandering set restricted to @xmath40 \\times [ -2,2 ] $ ] .",
    "we recall that a point @xmath42 belongs to the _ nonwandering _ set @xmath43 of @xmath44 if it has the property that for every neighbourhood @xmath45 of @xmath42 there exists some @xmath46 such that @xmath47 .",
    "the nonwandering set is always invariant and closed ( and thus if bounded , also compact ) .",
    "we say that a compact invariant set @xmath33 is _ uniformly hyperbolic _",
    "( with respect to @xmath44 ) if there exists constants @xmath48 and a _ continuous _",
    "decomposition @xmath49 of the tangent bundle such that for every @xmath50 , every non - zero vector @xmath51 and @xmath52 and every @xmath46 we have @xmath53 by standard hyperbolic theory , the stable and unstable subspaces @xmath54 are tangent everywhere to the stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "in particular uniform hyperbolicity is incompatible with the presence of any tangencies in @xmath33 between any stable and any unstable invariant manifolds associated to points of @xmath55 .",
    "a weaker notion of hyperbolicity can be formulated in terms of invariant measures .",
    "for simplicity we restrict our discussion to the two - dimensional setting , as relevant to the situation we consider in this paper .",
    "let @xmath56 be an @xmath44-invariant ergodic probability measure with support in some compact invariant set @xmath33 . by oseledec",
    "s ergodic theorem @xcite there exist constants @xmath57 and a measurable decomposition @xmath49 such that for @xmath56-almost every @xmath58 and every non - zero vector @xmath51 and @xmath52 we have @xmath59 the constants @xmath60 and @xmath61 are called the _",
    "lyapunov exponents _ associated to the measure @xmath56 .",
    "we say that @xmath56 is _ hyperbolic _",
    "@xcite if @xmath62 clearly implies for any @xmath56 .",
    "the converse however is false in general : the measurable decomposition may not extend to a continuous one on all of @xmath33 and the exponential expansion and contraction in implies only a limited version of in which the constants @xmath63 are measurable functions of @xmath64 and not bounded away from 0 .",
    "this definition of hyperbolicity in terms of lyapunov exponents is sometimes called _ nonuniform hyperbolicity _ and is consistent in principle with the existence of tangencies between stable and unstable manifolds .      in general",
    "there may be many ergodic invariant probability measures supported in @xmath33 of which some may be hyperbolic and some not . even if they are all hyperbolic the corresponding lyapunov exponents may not be uniformly bounded way from @xmath65 .",
    "the situation in which all lyapunov exponents of all ergodic invariant measures are uniformly bounded away from zero is , in some sense , as `` uniformly hyperbolic '' as one can get while admitting the existence of tangencies .",
    "this situation can indeed occur , for example in the present context of hnon - like maps .",
    "a first example of a set satisfying this property was given in @xcite .",
    "after completing the proof of the theorem 1 we realized that _",
    "much simpler _ versions of our arguments yield an analogous , new and non - trivial , result in the context of one - dimensional maps . we explain and give a precise formulation of this result .",
    "we consider first the quadratic family @xmath66 we choose this particular parametrization for convenience and consistency with our two dimensional results , but any choice of smooth family of unimodal or even multimodal maps with negative schwarzian derivative would work in exactly the same way .",
    "it is well known that for @xmath67 the nonwandering set @xmath30 is uniformly expanding although we emphasize here that this depends crucially on the negative schwarzian derivative property .",
    "the negative schwarzian property is not robust with respect to @xmath0 perturbations and standard methods do not therefore yield this statement for such perturbations .",
    "there exists a constant @xmath68 such that if a family @xmath69 of @xmath70 one - dimensional maps satisfies @xmath71 then there exists a unique parameter value @xmath28 such that    1 .   for all @xmath72 the non - wandering set",
    "@xmath33 is uniformly hyperbolic ; 2 .   for @xmath31",
    "the lyapunov exponents of all ergodic invariant probability measures are all positive and uniformly bounded away from 0",
    ".    moreover the rates of expansion and the bound on the lyapunov exponents are uniform , independent of the family and of the parameter .",
    "the proof of this result is exactly the same as that of theorem 1 but hugely simpler as all more geometrical arguments concerning curvature etc become essentially trivial .",
    "we emphasize that the uniform expansivity of @xmath30 for a particular parameter value @xmath67 is of course robust under sufficiently small perturbations of @xmath39 , by standard hyperbolic theory .",
    "however this approach _ requires the size of the perturbation to depend on the parameter _",
    "@xmath10 and in particular to shrink to zero as @xmath10 tends to @xmath73 . the crucial point of our approach , both in this one - dimensional setting , as in the two - dimensional setting is that the size of the perturbation _ does not _",
    "depend on the parameter .",
    "we have divided our argument into three main sections . in section [ proofnonwan ]",
    "we analyze the geometric structure of stable and unstable manifolds of the two fixed points and define the parameter @xmath28 as the first parameter for which a tangency occurs between some compact parts of these manifolds .",
    "we also identify a region @xmath74 which we show contains the non - wandering set .",
    "in section [ sectionhyp ] we define a `` critical neighbourhood '' @xmath75 outside of which our maps are uniformly hyperbolic by simple perturbation arguments",
    ". however @xmath76 does contain points of @xmath33 and thus we can not ignore this region . to control the hyperbolicity in @xmath75 we introduce the notions of hyperbolic coordinates and critical points which form the key technical core of our approach .",
    "finally , in section [ sectionhypest ] we apply these techniques to prove the required hyperbolicity properties .",
    "in this section we define the parameter @xmath77 as in the statement of our main theorem , and show that for @xmath78 the nonwandering set is contained in the closure if the unstable manifold of a hyperbolic fixed point restricted to a certain compact region of @xmath79 .",
    "we define the bifurcation parameter @xmath28 below as the first parameter for which there is a tangency between certain compact parts of the stable and unstable manifolds of the fixed points .",
    "this does not immediately imply that it is a first parameter of tangency though this will follow from our proof of the fact that the nonwandering set is uniformly hyperbolic for all @xmath29 .      for the endomorphisms",
    "@xmath81 with @xmath82 , there are two fixed points , @xmath83 both hyperbolic .",
    "for the special parameter value @xmath84 , to simplify the notation below , we write @xmath85 since @xmath86 and @xmath87 are repelling in the horizontal direction , their stable sets are simply their preimages : @xmath88 in particular these sets contain the following curves @xmath89 and @xmath90     and @xmath91.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    the first preimage of @xmath86 is a parabola with a minimum at @xmath92 and intersecting the @xmath64-axis at @xmath93 , and having slope equal to @xmath94 at the point @xmath95 and the second is a parabola with a minimum at @xmath96 .",
    "similarly we can compute @xmath97 which is a parabola with a minimum at @xmath98 , intersecting the @xmath64-axis at @xmath99 and having slope equal to @xmath73 at the point @xmath100 , and @xmath101 which is a parabola with a minimum at @xmath102 .",
    "the unstable manifolds going @xmath103 and @xmath104 can be defined and computed in a similar way and are easily seen to be horizontal .",
    "consider first the _",
    "hnon family _",
    "@xmath105 for @xmath106 , @xmath107 is a diffeomorphism .",
    "the hyperbolicity of the fixed points implies that there exists a neighbourhood of the set @xmath108 corresponding to pairs of parameters for which there is an _ analytic continuation _ @xmath109 as hyperbolic fixed points of @xmath107 . considering @xmath110 small , we also have that the analytic continuations @xmath111 and @xmath112 are also well defined and hyperbolic . for simplicity we shall often just refer to these two points as @xmath113 leaving implicit their dependence on @xmath44 .",
    "explicit formulas for @xmath109 can be easily derived from the equation @xmath114 but these would not be particular useful . instead we just observe that the fixed points must lie on the line @xmath115 and so in particular this means that for @xmath116 and @xmath117 the vertical coordinates of @xmath118 and @xmath119 are negative and positive respectively , and the converse for @xmath120 .",
    "clearly the same holds for @xmath121 and @xmath122 if @xmath12 is sufficiently small .",
    "moreover , the determinant of @xmath123 is given by @xmath124 in particular the determinant is constant and negative if @xmath21 is positive and positive if @xmath21 is negative .",
    "we thus refer to the case @xmath125 as the _ orientation - reversing _ case , and the case @xmath126 as the _ orientation - preserving _ case .    ) and the orientation - preserving ( @xmath127 ) case ( dotted curves indicate negative eigenvalues),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] ) and the orientation - preserving ( @xmath127 ) case ( dotted curves indicate negative eigenvalues),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    recall that the determinant of a matrix is the product of the eigenvalues , and thus in particular , the sign of the determinant has implications for the sign of the eigenvalues which , as we shall see , in turn has implications for the geometry of the stable and unstable manifolds of the fixed points . for @xmath35",
    "the fixed points @xmath128 and @xmath129 have derivatives @xmath130 and @xmath131 respectively , and thus , for @xmath22 and @xmath12 small , the expanding eigenvalues of @xmath132 and @xmath133 are @xmath134 and @xmath135 respectively .",
    "this implies that for @xmath136 , the orientation - reversing case , the contracting eigenvalues of @xmath137 and @xmath132 must be @xmath138 and @xmath139 respectively , while for @xmath127 , the orientation preserving case , they must be @xmath139 and @xmath140 respectively .",
    "the two situations are illustrated in figure [ fixedpoints ] with dashed lines showing the invariant manifolds corresponding to negative eigenvalues .      by classical hyperbolic theory ,",
    "compact parts of the stable manifolds depend continuously on the map ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , for small @xmath21 and small @xmath12 the analytic continuations @xmath113 of the fixed points @xmath129 and @xmath128 have stable and unstable manifolds which are close to those computed above for the limiting case .",
    "elementary calculations show that the actual geometrical relations between these continuations depend on whether we consider the orientation reversing ( @xmath125 ) or the orientation preserving ( @xmath127 ) case , and are as illustrated in figure [ intersection ] .",

    "again this continues to hold also for a hnon - like family for sufficiently small @xmath149 .",

    "we carry out a detailed geometrical study aimed at showing that the nonwandering set is contained in a relatively restricted region . to prove hyperbolicity",
    "we will then just have to focus our efforts in this region .",
    "for the moment we restrict ourselves to the orientation - reversing case . at the end we shall remark how the orientation - preserving case follows by identical arguments with a few minor changes of notation .",
