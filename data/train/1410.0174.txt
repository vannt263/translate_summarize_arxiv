    "all energy contributions show similar oscillations after the excitation pulse and pass energy between each other .",
    "in particular , the oscillation of the linear interaction energy , , and photon energy , , are strong and almost in anti - phase . in the following ,",
    "we will concentrate on the oscillations of the photon energy or more precisely said , the oscillations in the mean photon number , which is proportional to the photon energy .    during the excitation pulse",
    ", there is an additional energy appearing due to the excitation pulse itself @xmath72.\\ ] ] the excitation pulse can also increase or decrease the total energy of the otherwise closed system .",
    "the change of the total energy is relatively small compared to the photon excitation energy @xmath73 . in this sense",
    ", the excitation pulse can be considered to be weak meaning that it can not change the mean photon number by a whole photon .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the response of the charge density to the external excitation of the quantum ring system .",
    "excited by the dipole excitation pulse in @xmath17-direction , the center of charge ( dipole moment of the charge density ) @xmath74\\ ] ] with @xmath75 being the dipole operator , @xmath76 where @xmath77 , oscillates as is shown in .",
    "the oscillations are a superposition of periodic oscillations after the excitation pulse , but not during the time , the pulse is exciting the system .",
    "we therefore exclude the excitation time interval @xmath78 for a further analysis of the oscillations .",
    "figure [ fft ] shows the ft of the center of charge oscillations .",
    "it is mainly composed of two peaks , a strong one at @xmath79  mev and a much weaker one at @xmath80  mev .",
    "( notice the logarithmic scale of the peak height . ) for @xmath17- or @xmath19-polarized ( linearly polarized ) cavity photon field the center of charge oscillates in @xmath17-direction , meaning that @xmath81 is vanishing .",
    "we have seen , however , that a circularly polarized cavity photon field leads to center of charge oscillations in both @xmath82 and @xmath81 , even though the excitation pulse is only a dipole excitation in @xmath17-direction .",
    "alternatively , a strong magnetic field leads also to center of charge oscillations in both the @xmath17- and @xmath19-direction , even though the cavity photon field is linearly polarized .",
    "we have seen earlier that the photon energy oscillates also in time . in",
    ", we show the related mean photon number @xmath83\\ ] ] as a function of time , which describes the number of cavity photons in the system .",
    "similar to , the oscillations are a superposition of periodic oscillations after the excitation pulse , but the main components are of a higher frequency .",
    "this can be seen more clearly from the fourier analysis in , which shows the main peaks at the energies @xmath84  mev , @xmath85  mev , @xmath86  mev and @xmath87  mev , which would all be visible in a linear plot with the largest fourier peak at the relatively high energy @xmath86  mev . as mentioned earlier",
    "the oscillations of the electron energy and electron - photon interaction energy are composed of a similar frequency spectrum as the mean photon number .",
    "but why are the center of charge oscillations with a different spectral composition ( ) ?      to understand the fourier components of the oscillations in the center of charge and the mean photon number , we have a look at the mb energy spectrum of the quantum ring system and the occupation of the mb states at @xmath47  ps in . only a few states are with an occupation above @xmath88 , which we find all relevant to understand the visible peaks in a linear plot .",
    "( the sum over the occupation of all mb states is one . )",
    "this is showing that the dipole excitation pulse is not very strong , it is however strong enough that we would expect differences in the results , when we would compare to a linear response calculation . furthermore , the relevant mb states lie all at rather low energies , hinting at the fact that the selected @xmath89 mb states are sufficient to predict the time - evolution of the system with reasonable accuracy ( only the lowest mb states are shown in ) .",
    "the energetic position and occupation of the mb states changes slightly with the electron - photon coupling constant @xmath90 .    to compare the mb spectrum to the fourier analysis of the center of charge oscillations",
    ", we look at . here",
    ", we have plotted the bohr energies @xmath91 between all mb states with occupation above @xmath88 and compare them to the peaks of the ft of the center of charge oscillations .",
    "we can see that not all transitions are likely or allowed and that some selection rules apply .",
    "in particular , we find the allowed transitions by considering the value of the matrix element @xmath92 with @xmath93 being the mb representation of the dipole potential .",
    "the bohr energies of the allowed transitions with large @xmath94 are @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "these transitions are allowed for the whole @xmath90-range .",
    "in addition , for @xmath98 , the bohr energies @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are allowed .",
    "the bohr energies @xmath95 and @xmath96 can be recognized as peaks of the ft of the center of charge oscillations .",
    "the occupation of the higher mb states @xmath102 is very low , such that the transition @xmath97 is very weak .",
    "the same argument applies for the transitions , which are only allowed for @xmath98 . when comparing the two allowed and likely ft peaks in their strength , the peak with @xmath95 is dominant over the peak with @xmath96 .",
    "this can be directly correlated to the fact that the occupation of the mb state @xmath103 is much larger than the occupation of the mb state @xmath104 .",
    "figure [ levels_x_photon ] shows the comparison of the mb spectrum to the fourier analysis of the mean photon number oscillations .",
    "we note here , that we can associate a fractional photon content @xmath105 to each mb state . the deviation of the photon content from integer numbers increases in general with the electron - photon coupling strength @xmath90 .",
    "still , we can approximately state that the mb states @xmath106 are with a photon content close to zero and @xmath107 are with a photon content close to one . the transitions observed as ft peaks of the mean photon number are @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 . except for the strongest peak with @xmath110 , the photon content is changing in all other transitions by approximately one ( @xmath112 ) . for the peak with @xmath110 ,",
    "the photon content difference of the states is @xmath113 for @xmath114  mev and gets smaller with decreasing @xmath90 .",
    "however , it is clear from that the occupation of the excited mb state for the transitions with @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath111 becomes also smaller with decreasing @xmath90 . as a consequence",
    ", we found all fourier peaks of the mean photon number to become smaller with decreasing @xmath90 , but their relative strength is almost conserved ( i.e.  the main change of with @xmath90 is only the scaling of the @xmath19-axis ) .",
    "therefore , we have to consider both the change in the photon content @xmath115 and the occupations of the two mb states associated with the transition to be able to say something about the selection rules governing the optical transitions . as a side remark , we could also associate an angular momentum @xmath116 to each mb state with increasing deviations from integer angular momentum numbers @xmath117 with increasing electron - photon coupling strength @xmath90 . the absolute value of the angular momentum number @xmath118 for the mb states @xmath119 ; @xmath120 for the mb states @xmath121 ; and @xmath122 for the mb state @xmath104 . the mb states corresponding to the ft peaks of the mean photon number show a difference of @xmath123 with one exception with the bohr energy @xmath110 , where @xmath124 .",
    "the approximate values of the absolute value of the angular momentum numbers @xmath125 and photon contents @xmath126 for the mostly populated mb levels are depicted in .",
    "it shows also the bohr energies , which describe the frequencies of the center of charge oscillations and the frequencies of the oscillations of the mean photon number .",
    "one could pose the interesting question concerning the transition with bohr energy @xmath110 of the latter type , where @xmath124 and @xmath127 , whether this transition would in fact be composed of two processes , each with @xmath123 and possibly a photon content difference @xmath112 in the first and @xmath128 in the second process .",
    "we have studied the non - linear response of a quantum ring system to a short dipole excitation pulse .",
    "the quantum ring system is coupled to a photon cavity using exact numerical diagonalization .",
    "we have seen that the many - level description is essential to describe properly the physical response of the system .",
    "the short pulse excites oscillations of the energy between the electron and cavity photons .",
    "the coupling energy between the photons and electron is small as the linear and quadratic term in the vector potential are of opposite signs .",
    "we find center of charge oscillations in the direction of the dipole excitation of the pulse .",
    "the direction of the linear polarized cavity photon field does not influence the center of charge oscillation direction . a circularly polarized cavity photon field or magnetic field , however , changes the direction .",
    "the oscillations of the mean photon number and center of charge have a different fourier spectrum , but are all reflected in transition energies between mb levels .",
    "the oscillator strengths for the center of charge oscillation spectrum are given by selection rules due to the matrix elements of the dipole potential with the mb states corresponding to a mb transition ( i.e.  the geometrical symmetry of the mb states ) and the population of the levels .",
    "for the selection rules governing the mean photon number oscillations , the difference of the photon content of the mb states determining a transition and the mb level population play a crucial role .    in summary , we have supplied a rather small amount of energy to the system with an excitation pulse with a rather broad frequency spectrum , we are thus not exciting isolated resonances in the system , but instead probing its response to a broad frequency range .",
    "it is demonstrated why both the linear and quadratic electron - photon interactions are necessary together with a large section of the system states .",
