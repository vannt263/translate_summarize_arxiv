    "in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath0 the problem of two charged particles can not be solved in a closed form as the relative motion and the motion of the center of mass are coupled to each other .",
    "therefore no theory exists for a solution of this problem that is uniformly valid for any strength of the magnetic field and the coulomb force between the particles .",
    "the energy loss of ion beams and the related processes in a magnetized plasmas which are important in many areas of physics such as transport , heating , magnetic confinement of thermonuclear plasmas and astrophysics are examples of physical situations where this problem arises .",
    "this topic was studied starting with the classic papers in ref .   using kinetic equation approach , where the binary collisions of the particles are masked due to the velocity average in the collision operator .",
    "recent applications are the cooling of heavy ion beams by electrons  sor83,pot90,mes94,men08 and the energy transfer for heavy - ion inertial confinement fusion.@xcite    calculations have been performed for binary collisions ( bc ) between magnetized electrons  @xcite and for collisions between magnetized electrons and ions.@xcite in the presence of a magnetic field only the total energy @xmath1 of the interacting particles is conserved but not the relative and center of mass energies separately . in addition , the rotational symmetry of the system is broken , and as a consequence only the component of the angular momentum parallel to the magnetic field is a constant of motion .",
    "the apparently simple problem of charged particle interaction in a magnetic field is in fact a problem of considerable complexity and the additional degree of freedom of the cyclotron orbital motion produces a chaotic system with two degrees of freedom.@xcite    in this paper we consider the bc between two gyrating charged particles treating the interaction ( coulomb ) as a perturbation to their helical motions .",
    "for electron - heavy ion collisions this has been done previously in first - order in the ion charge @xmath2 for an ion at rest @xcite and up to @xmath3 for an uniformly moving heavy ion .",
    "@xcite here we focus on second - order perturbation theory and its comparison with classical trajectory monte carlo ( ctmc ) simulations .",
    "the present work considerably extends the earlier studies in refs .   where the second - order energy transfer was calculated for an electron - heavy ion bc neglecting the gyration of the ion or assuming identical gyrating particles ( e.g. electrons ) .",
    "but in some cases of an interaction of magnetized electrons with light ions ( e.g. protons , antiprotons ) at a rather strong magnetic field ( e.g. in traps ) the cyclotron motion of the ion can not be neglected .",
    "the general expressions for the energy transfers are briefly discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : s1 ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : s2 ] we discuss the perturbative methodology used in this work .",
    "then we turn to the explicit calculation of the second - order energy transfer for two arbitrary gyrating particle collision and without any restriction on the magnetic field . in sec .",

    "for our description of bc we start with the equations of motion for two charged particles moving in a homogeneous magnetic field and the related conservation laws in general .",
    "next the quantities of interest , the velocity transfer , and the energy transfer of particles during the binary collision will be introduced and discussed , before we turn to the solution of the equations of motion in the subsequent section . for further details",

    "relative velocities which exceed the thermal velocity lead to an asymmetric interaction potential which in general considerably complicates the theoretical description .",
    "it has been shown , however , that such a dynamic , highly asymmetric interaction potential can be replaced with an effective spherically symmetric velocity - dependent interaction @xmath15 with a velocity - dependent screening length @xmath16.@xcite we adopt these findings for our present considerations and assume a spherically symmetric interaction with a given fixed screening length in both our analytic expressions and the ctmc simulations . for the envisaged applications of our given results , such as cooling forces , stopping power , etc . ,",
    "which typically involves an average over the velocity distribution , the screening length has then to be replaced by an appropriately chosen velocity - dependent one .",

    "in addition in the limit of very large velocities @xmath249 the elcs @xmath233 calculated either within perturbation theory or ctmc method with different strength of the magnetic field and @xmath250 converge to the same value .",
    "this behavior agrees with the predictions of the asymptotic eq .   which is independent on @xmath243 and @xmath251 , @xmath252 .",

    "assuming that the magnetic field is infinitely strong this model completely ignores the cyclotron motion of the particles and they move along @xmath73 .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that for repulsive interaction the magnetic field together with the interaction potential forms a potential barrier because of the particles motion is effectively one - dimensional . in this case",
    "the relative velocity transfer is @xmath275 which corresponds to a reversion of the initial motion , i.e. to a backscattering event .",

    "[ fig:4 ] the agreement with ctmc simulations is quite satisfactory even for finite cyclotron radii and magnetic field .",

    "the hard collisions like backscattering events may also occur but the transverse dynamics of the particles will reduce the domain of the backscattering events@xcite . with increasing @xmath271",

    "the second - order energy transfers for two  particles collision is calculated with the help of an improved bc treatment which is valid for any strength of the magnetic field and involves all cyclotron harmonics of the particles motion . for further applications ( e.g. , in cooling of ion beams , transport phenomena in magnetized plasmas )",
    "the actual calculations of the energy transfers have been done with a screened interaction potential which is regularized at the origin .",
    "the use of that potential can be viewed as an alternative to the standard cutoff procedure .    for checking the validity of the perturbative approach and also for applications beyond the perturbative regime",
    "we have employed numerical ctmc simulations .",
    "these ctmc calculations have been performed for a very strong magnetic field and in a wide range of @xmath271 and for a small regularization parameter , that is , for an interaction which is rather close to coulomb at short distances . within the second - order treatment",
    "we have introduced a dynamic cutoff parameter which substantially improves the agreement of the theory with ctmc simulations . from a comparison with the nonperturbative ctmc simulations we have found as a quite general rule which is widely independent of the magnetic field strength that the predictions of the second - order perturbative treatment are very accurate for @xmath282 for all studied parameters and cases . in contrast , for low relative velocities @xmath283 the results obtained from perturbation theory strongly deviate from the ctmc simulations . we have also tested the exact analytical model derived for repulsive interaction and an infinitely strong magnetic field in ref .   by comparing it in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] with the ctmc simulations and found that the agreement is rather satisfactory even for finite ( but strong ) magnetic fields .",
    "we believe that our theoretical findings will be useful for the interpretation of experimental investigations . here , it is of particular interest to study some macroscopic physical quantities on the basis of the presented theoretical model such as cooling forces in storage rings and traps , stopping power of ion beams as well as transport coefficients in strongly magnetized plasmas .",
    "these studies require an average of the energy or velocity transfers with respect to the velocity distribution of the electrons .",
    "the cooling forces obtained by the perturbative approach are expected to be quite accurate if the low velocity regime only slightly contributes to the @xmath284 average over @xmath285 .",
    "that is , if the typical @xmath271 , given by the maximum of the thermal electron velocity and the ion velocity , are large compared to @xmath196 , as it is usually the case for , e.g. , electron cooling in storage rings .",
    "is grateful for the support of the alexander von humboldt foundation , germany .",
    "this work was supported by the bundesministerium fr bildung und forschung ( bmbf ) under contract 06er9064 .",
    "for the second - order bc treatment the most critical situation is the small velocity regime where we expect some deviations from the nonperturbative ctmc simulations . for the improvement of the theoretical approach it is therefore imperative to investigate the energy transfer in the small velocity limit , @xmath286 , or alternatively @xmath287 . in principle",
    "this limit can be evaluated using the integral representation of the elcs , eqs .   and .",
    "however , while these expressions are very convenient to calculate the high velocity limit of the energy transfers ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : s2 ] ) they are not adopted for the evaluation of the small velocity limit due to the oscillatory nature of the function @xmath179 at @xmath288 . in this appendix we consider instead an alternative but equivalent expression for the elcs . for the axially symmetric interaction potential",
