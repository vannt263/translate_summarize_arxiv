    "<S> the sharp peak at the fermi energy corresponds to partially filled fe-@xmath15 band . </S>",
    "<S> broad bands between -2 and 6 ev represent oxygen and arsenicum @xmath18 bands .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have calculated the values of coulomb interaction parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 via constrained dft procedure in the basis of wannier functions . for minimal model including only fe-@xmath3 orbitals and bands we have obtained coulomb parameters @xmath8=0.8  ev , @xmath2=0.5  ev . for `` full basis '' calculations coulomb parameters are @xmath8=3.5  ev , @xmath2=0.8  ev . the lda+dmft calculation for both models with calculated parameters results in weakly correlated nature of iron @xmath15 bands in this compound . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is supported by spectroscopic investigations of this material . </S>",
    "<S> as the choice of the orbitals to construct the effective hubbard model from lda results is to some extent arbitrary , showing that different choices leading to largely different interaction parameters yield similar physical observables provides an important consistency test of the whole procedure .    </S>",
