    "for a long time it was believed that distinct phases of matter can be classified entirely by the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking , which is formulated mathematically in the ginzburg - landau theory . with the discovery of the quantum hall effect @xcite",
    "it has become clear that this classification has to be extended by the inclusion of topological orders @xcite .",
    "more recently , the discovery of topological insulators @xcite and subsequent theoretical analysis @xcite have revealed that the class of topologically ordered states contains a large number of phases , at least some of which have concrete physical implementations and can be observed in experiments .",
    "when the quantum hall effects were discovered @xcite , solid state systems were the most promising candidates to search for new phases of matter .",
    "nowadays ultracold atom experiments constitute a promising alternative platform for a systematic search for novel states of matter @xcite .",
    "their large length scales make a number of new measurement methods available , and the cleanness allows for long coherence times .",
    "these ingredients have enabled the observation of the superfluid to mott insulator transition in the bose hubbard model @xcite , which can be understood from the ginzburg - landau paradigm . over the last century , great effort has been devoted to the observation of _ topological _ phase transitions in such systems , going beyond the ginzburg - landau paradigm .",
    "in particular systems with synthetic magnetic fields were studied @xcite , where analogues of the quantum hall effects were predicted to be observable . recently",
    "this goal has been achieved and topological phase transitions where observed in systems of essentially non - interacting ultracold quantum gases @xcite .",
    "while all possible topological phases of non - interacting fermions in arbitrary dimensions have been classified @xcite , it is established that interactions can enrich the number of possible topological phases enormously , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the resulting phases attract much attention because they can support exotic excitations with fractional charge and statistics @xcite , which have possible applications for topological quantum computation @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a setup for the realization of topological states in strongly interacting bosons , see fig.[fig : intro ] . to this end",
    ", we consider the thin - torus - limit @xcite of a 2d fractional chern insulator on a square lattice @xcite , and show how it can be implemented in current experiments with ultracold quantum gases .",
    "the resulting groundstate is a cdw at average filling @xmath0 per lattice site , related to the @xmath2 laughlin state @xcite in the 2d limit .",
    "it can be interpreted as well as a symmetry protected topological phase @xcite ( protected by inversion symmetry ) .",
    "in addition our model includes the possibility of twisted boundary conditions around the short perimeter of the torus , with a fully tunable twist angle @xmath3 , see fig.[fig : intro ] ( b ) .",
    "adiabatically changing this twist angle by @xmath4 realizes a many - body version of a thouless pump @xcite , which is _ fractionally _ quantized , see fig.[fig : intro ] ( c ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : model ] we introduce the model and show that it is identical to the thin - torus - limit of the 2d hofstadter - hubbard model .",
    "possible experimental realizations are discussed . in sec.[sec : topologynoninteractingsystem ] we elucidate on the topological properties in the non - interacting case , and show that they enable a realization of a thouless pump . in sec .",
    "[ sec : interactingtopology ] we return to the discussion of interacting bosons , where dmrg results for the melting of the cdw at weak interactions and the system in a harmonic trap are presented .",
    "the topological classification of the ground state is carried out in sec .",
    "[ sec : topclass ] , before we close our discussion with a summary and an outlook in sec .",
    "[ sec : outlooksummary ] .",
    "we consider the following bose - hubbard type model of bosons hopping between the links of a 1d ladder , see fig.[fig : intro ] ( a ) , @xmath5 here @xmath6 annihilates a boson on the left ( @xmath7 ) or the right ( @xmath8 ) leg of the ladder , at the horizontal link @xmath9 .",
    "the first line describes hopping along the ladder ( vertical links ) with amplitude @xmath10 . on the right leg",
    "an additional phase @xmath11 is picked up on every second bond , for @xmath12 from even @xmath9 to odd @xmath13 and for @xmath14 from odd @xmath9 to even @xmath13 . along the horizontal bonds the tunneling rates are alternating between @xmath15 and @xmath16 , both assumed",
    "to be real - valued and positive . in the third line we added on - site hubbard - type interactions of strength @xmath17 everywhere . the model is completed by an external harmonic trapping potential in the fourth line .",
    "below we will show that the model is equivalent to the thin - torus - limit of the 2d hofstadter hubbard model .",
    "afterwards we discuss possible experimental realizations with ultra - cold atoms using currently available technology , based on the experimental setups described in @xcite .",
    "now we show how the model can be related to the thin - torus - limit of the 2d hofstadter - hubbard model with flux per plaquette @xmath18 ( in units of the flux quantum ) .",
    "the latter is described by a hamiltonian @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are peierls phases picked up when hopping from site @xmath22 to a neighboring site @xmath23 .",
    "when a particle is hopping around a plaquette these phases sum up to @xmath24 , which can be achieved e.g. with the gauge choice @xmath21 shown in fig.[fig : mappingthintorus ] ( a ) .",
    "next we consider this model on a torus of size @xmath25 with twisted boundary conditions along @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the coordinate of the @xmath29-th particle , @xmath30 .",
    "such boundary conditions can be implemented by adding additional phases @xmath3 to the hoppings from @xmath31 to @xmath32 for all @xmath33 .",
    "we perform the thin - torus - limit by setting the length @xmath34 equal to two lattice sites , yielding an effective ladder system as shown in fig.[fig : mappingthintorus ] ( b ) . because of the periodic boundary conditions along @xmath26 there are two possibilities how a boson can tunnel from the left to the right leg of the ladder , originating from paths across the top and bottom of the torus .",
    "when summing up these contributions , we obtain complex hoppings across the ladder @xmath35 from @xmath36 to @xmath37 and @xmath38 from @xmath39 to @xmath40 ( site - labels as in eq . ) , see fig.[fig : mappingthintorus ] ( c ) .",
    "the hopping elements along the legs of the ladder are real and given by @xmath41 at links @xmath37 to @xmath40 and @xmath10 at all other links .    to show the equivalence of the thin - torus hofstadter hubbard model to the hamiltonian we now define @xmath42 , yielding @xmath43 such that the absolute values of all hopping amplitudes in both models coincide .",
    "thus , we only have to calculate the magnetic fluxes through each of the plaquettes of the ladder and show that they coincide in both models . in the thin - torus - limit of the 2d model",
    "we obtain fluxes @xmath44 and @xmath45 in units of the magnetic flux quantum , see fig.[fig : mappingthintorus ] ( b ) , ( c ) . choosing @xmath46 in eq .",
    "we obtain the same fluxes in the 1d ladder model",
    ". therefore the thin - torus - limit of the @xmath18 hofstadter hubbard model is equivalent to the model , up to a unitary gauge transformation @xmath47 which depends explicitly on the twist - angle @xmath3 .",
    "quasi 1d ladder systems were investigated before , and it was shown that effective gauge fields give rise to interesting physical effects such as meissner currents @xcite . a version of the thin - torus - limit of the hofstadter model at arbitrary flux per plaquette @xmath48 was also studied already in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to our model , this work did not take into account periodic boundary conditions across the ladder , resulting in a _ homogeneous _ flux @xmath49 per plaquette and equal hopping amplitudes corresponding to @xmath50 using our notations . as a consequence",
    "the authors could study interesting edge states , carrying chiral currents along opposite edges of the ladder . within our model on the other hand , we can study the effect of tunable twisted boundary conditions across the ladder .",
    "in addition , we study interactions between bosons .",
    "next we discuss a possible experimental realization of our scheme .",
    "the first required ingredient is a superlattice for creating ladders ( with a four - site unit - cell ) , which has been implemented experimentally , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the second ingredient is a ( staggered ) artificial gauge field , which has been experimentally demonstrated as well @xcite .",
    "the implementation of the hamiltonian is motivated and very closely related to the recent experiment @xcite , and we think that alternative realizations should be possible .    to begin with , our scheme requires a cubic lattice created by standing waves with short wavelength @xmath51 both in @xmath26 and @xmath52 direction .",
    "we choose the origin such , that lattice sites are centered at @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "additional standing waves with long wavelength @xmath56 are required in both directions .",
    "the strong long - lattice along @xmath26 separates the individual ladders , whereas the weaker long - lattice along @xmath52 induces a staggered potential of strength @xmath57 along the legs that is indicated by white and grey filled sites in fig .",
    "[ fig : realization](a ) .",
    "this staggered potential is required for realizing the artificial magnetic field .",
    "we will denote the bare hopping elements in the so - obtained ladder by @xmath58 ( along the ladder ) and @xmath59 ( across the ladder ) .",
    "the alternating flux @xmath60 ( in units of the magnetic flux quantum ) can be realized with a similar configuration as in the experiment @xcite , where a homogeneous flux of @xmath18 was realized via laser assisted tunneling @xcite .",
    "bare hopping along the legs is strongly suppressed by the staggered potential @xmath61 , and has to be restored by resonant modulation of the potential landscape .",
    "this can be achieved by a time - dependent potential of the form @xmath62 , and as pointed out by kolovsky @xcite the freedom in choosing the phase - shifts @xmath63 allows to implement peierls phases  and thus to create artificial gauge fields . to implement a suitable time - dependent potential experimentally",
    ", two side - bands of the long - wavelength laser can be employed .",
    "they make up four additional beams , two red - detuned ones with frequencies @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and two blue - detuned ones at frequencies @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "when the red sidebands are sufficiently far detuned from the blue sidebands , i.e. @xmath68 for both @xmath69 , interference terms between them can be neglected and they can be treated separately form each other .",
    "we now move on by constructing suitable interference patterns between the red - detuned and blue - detuned pairs of beams respectively , with relative frequencies @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "these beat - notes give rise to the required modulation of the potential at frequency @xmath57 , and we chose them to be @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "as in @xcite both beams @xmath74 and @xmath75 are retroreflected in @xmath26 direction to form standing waves , see fig .",
    "[ fig : realization ] ( a ) , and they interfere with running waves @xmath76 and @xmath77 in @xmath52 direction .",
    "this configuration gives rise to the time - dependent interference patterns shown in fig.[fig : realization ] ( b ) @xmath78,\\\\ v_b(x , y , t ) & = v_0/4\\big [ 1 + 4 \\sin^2(k_l x)\\nonumber\\\\ & + 4 \\sin(k_l x)\\cos(k_l y-\\delta t-\\pi/4 ) \\big ] .",
    "\\label{eq : vxyt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from fig.[fig : realization ] ( b ) we recognize that the phase of the retroreflected red sideband is chosen such that the resulting modulation is restricted to the left leg of the ladder and moves in negative @xmath52 direction in time .",
    "the blue sideband , vice - versa , leads to a modulation restricted to the right leg of the ladder which is moving in positive @xmath52-direction in time .",
    "this counter - directed movement of the potential modulation introduces angular momentum into the system , which mimics the effect of a magnetic field . note that the additional standing waves in eq .",
    "sum up to a constant overall energy shift only .",
    "the described setup is completely analogous to the one implemented in @xcite , except for the phases chosen for the different laser beams .",
    "now , as desired , every lattice site is subject to a time - dependent modulation of the local potential @xmath79 ( with @xmath80 ) . from eq .",
    "we read off the phase shifts , which are given by @xmath81 and @xmath82 . to proceed and calculate the resulting peierls phases ,",
    "let us consider the simplified case when two lattice sites @xmath83 and @xmath84 are coupled by a hopping element @xmath58 , where the second site is detuned by an energy @xmath61 from the first one .",
    "resonant periodic modulations of the local potentials @xmath85 with frequency @xmath57 and phases @xmath86 and @xmath87 restore strong hopping . indeed , the effective tunneling matrix element from @xmath83 to @xmath84 is given by @xmath88 @xcite , where we defined the amplitude @xmath10 as @xmath89 returning to the ladder model , in this way we find for the induced hoppings @xmath90 the above configuration can be mapped to eq . via a gauge transformation .",
    "finally we turn to the implementation of the hoppings @xmath91 connecting the legs of the ladder . without further modifications of the described setup ,",
    "they are given by @xmath92 .",
    "choosing the modulation strength @xmath93 such that @xmath94 readily realizes the cases @xmath95 .",
    "they are of special relevance , because the resulting model is inversion symmetric around the center of links on the legs .",
    "as will be shown below , the model supports inversion - symmetry protected topological phases at these points . in order to realize arbitrary values of @xmath3",
    ", the hoppings @xmath91 can be manipulated with a second independent square lattice rotated by @xmath96 , such that the potential barrier along every second horizontal bond of the ladder is increased when the lattice is properly adjusted .",
    "to this end an additional sideband of the short wavelength laser is added in @xmath26 and @xmath52 direction and both beams are retroreflected .",
    "the resulting interference pattern realizes the required rotated square lattice with lattice constant @xmath97 .",
    "lastly we note that the periodic modulation used to restore hoppings along the ladder reduces the tunneling amplitudes @xmath91 between the legs .",
    "this gives rise to effective hoppings @xmath98 , but the effect can be neglected for large @xmath57 .",
    "we start the analysis of our model by investigating non - interacting bosons . in this case",
    "all properties of the bandstructure immediately follow from the 2d hofstadter model @xcite .",
    "the lowest band of the 2d hofstadter hamiltonian at @xmath18 is characterized by a chern number @xmath99 , which gives rise to a quantized hall current perpendicular to an applied external force .",
    "we show below that such quantized particle transport along the 1d ladder survives in the thin - torus - limit , when the external force is induced by inserting magnetic flux through the smaller perimeter of the torus .",
    "experimentally this corresponds to an adiabatic change of the twisted boundary conditions , @xmath100 .",
    "a change of @xmath3 by @xmath4 can also be interpreted as one cycle of a thouless pump @xcite .",
    "now we discuss the relation between bloch wavefunctions of the one- and two - dimensional models . at @xmath18",
    "the 2d hofstadter model has a four - site unit - cell . using the gauge choice introduced earlier in fig.[fig : mappingthintorus ] ( a )",
    ", we can calculate the bloch hamiltonian @xmath101 of the 2d model , resulting in bloch wavefunctions @xmath102 ( see e.g. supplementary material in @xcite for a concrete calculation ) .",
    "when performing the thin - torus - limit as described in [ subsec : relationthintorus ] , the bloch wavefunctions do not change , except that the quasimomentum @xmath103 across the resulting ladder is replaced by the angle @xmath3 defining the twisted periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the bloch wavefunction in the thin - torus - limit thus reads @xmath104 . by applying the gauge transformation @xmath47 ( see [ subsec : relationthintorus ] )",
    "we also obtain the bloch function of the 1d ladder model , @xmath105 , at a given twist angle @xmath3 . consequently the bloch bands @xmath106 labeled by @xmath107",
    "( i.e. the eigenenergies of the bloch - hamiltonian ) of the 2d hofstadter hubbard model coincide with those of the 1d ladder model , @xmath108 .    from the bloch wavefunctions",
    "we will now derive the topological properties of the 1d ladder model . to this end",
    "we calculate the zak phase @xcite @xmath109 for a path through the brillouin zone ( bz ) along @xmath110 and for a given value of @xmath3 . because the zak phase is invariant under the gauge - transformation @xmath47 , the 1d ladder model reproduces the result @xmath111 of the 2d hofstadter model , @xmath112 .",
    "zak phases can be measured in ultra cold atom systems using ramsey interferometry in combination with bloch oscillations @xcite .",
    "a similar measurement in the simplified 1d model would thus allow to study the berry curvature of the 2d hofstadter model , see also @xcite .",
    "a characteristic feature of the hofstadter model at @xmath18 is that its lowest band is topologically non - trivial , with a chern number @xmath113 .",
    "the chern number can be directly related to the winding of the zak phase @xcite , @xmath114 for the 1d ladder model the winding of the zak phase equivalently defines the chern number , @xmath115 now we discuss the physical consequences of the non - trivial chern numbers @xmath116 . in the case of the 2d hofstadter model , it is related to the hall current induced by a constant external force @xcite .",
    "this current was recently measured with essentially non - interacting atoms , in ultra cold fermi gases @xcite and also with ultra cold bosons homogeneously populating the lowest bloch band @xcite . in the thin - torus limit of the hofstadter model ,",
    "a constant force around the short perimeter of the torus can be applied by adiabatically changing the twist angle in the boundary conditions , @xmath117 . like in the 2d model , this leads to a hall current perpendicular to the induced force ",
    "i.e. along the ladder  which is quantized and proportional to the chern number @xmath118 .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the quantized current in the 1d model is given by the concept of a thouless pump @xcite .",
    "to understand this , we note that the zak phase is related to the macroscopic polarization @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the extent of the magnetic unit - cell in @xmath52-direction @xcite .",
    "now , by definition , it follows that the zak - phase changes continuously from @xmath121 to @xmath122 when the parameter @xmath3 is adiabatically changed by @xmath4 in a time @xmath123 .",
    "this corresponds to a quantized change of the polarization by @xmath124 , or a quantized current @xmath125 . below ( in [ sec : topclass ] ) we give an intuitive explanation of the microscopic mechanism of this effect in the 1d ladder system .",
    "experimentally the thouless pump could be detected by loading non - interacting ultra cold atoms ( bosons or fermions ) into the lowest bloch band .",
    "then , comparing in - situ images of the atomic cloud before and after adiabatically changing @xmath3 by @xmath4 reveals the quantized current .",
    "this is similar to the measurements performed recently on the 2d hofstadter model @xcite .",
    "now we turn to the discussion of interacting atoms , where we will give an example for a _ fractionally quantized _",
    "thouless pump corresponding to a chern number @xmath126 .",
    "as a next step we add local hubbard - type interactions between the bosons to the investigation of our model . in the 2d limit of the hofstadter - hubbard model the existence of an incompressible laughlin - type ground state has been established numerically for fluxes within a range @xmath127 @xcite . for @xmath18 studied in this paper we thus expect a fractional chern insulator at a magnetic filling @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the number of particles and @xmath130 the number of flux quanta in the system . the average occupation number of each lattice site is thus @xmath0 in this phase .",
    "now we will show using dmrg calculations that in the thin - torus limit an incompressible cdw survives at the same filling .",
    "we study the robustness of this phase when the interaction strength @xmath17 is lowered . in a harmonic trap",
    "the incompressible phase is shown to be robust enough to form plateaus of constant density .",
    "we use a matrix product state ( mps ) based algorithm to find the ground state of finite size ladder systems with open boundary conditions ( obc ) @xcite .",
    "mps are very well suited to approximate the cdw like states we expect in the incompressible phase and can  with increased resources  also describe the melting of the cdw at fillings near @xmath0 . by varying the chemical potential we have determined the ground state energy for particle numbers around @xmath131 ( corresponding to @xmath0 ) and three different interaction energies @xmath132 . due to symmetries it is sufficient to consider twist angles from the parameter space @xmath133 $ ] .",
    "we now define the critical chemical potentials @xmath134 as the upper and lower boundaries of the incompressible cdw phase . in fig .",
    "[ fig : grandcanonicalpd](a ) we show the corresponding particle hole gap @xmath135 extrapolated to thermodynamic limit from finite system results at @xmath136 .",
    "strong interactions stabilize the non trivial cdw that is protected by a gap on the order of @xmath137 . at moderate interaction @xmath138 the incompressible phase is still protected by @xmath139 , whereas for @xmath140 the gap almost closes and the cdw phase vanishes .",
    "the topological nature of our system and the presence of obc edges have to be taken into account when analysing dependence of the particle number @xmath141 on the chemical potential , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : grandcanonicalpd](b ) . at @xmath142",
    "we find a single plateau at filling @xmath0 , however at @xmath143 this plateu is split by the addition of a single particle at intermediate chemical potential .",
    "this is an edge effect and strongly dependent on the choice of boundary conditions @xcite , allowing us to interpret the full plateau as an incompressible bulk phase .",
    "the incompressible , integer filling phases of the conventional bose - hubbard model can be nicely demonstrated in harmonically trapped systems where mott - insulating plateaus of constant density emerge , surrounded by superfluid regions ( `` wedding - cake '' structure ) .",
    "we here show that in a similar fashion the non trivial cdw phase on the ladder could be visualized in harmonically trapped gases .    using the mps code ( with increased bond dimension to correctly describe the compressible regions in the trap )",
    "we have calculated the density distribution in traps up to size @xmath144 for fixed global chemical potential @xmath145 .",
    "the trap depth @xmath146 is choosen such that from local density approximation we expect a wedding cake structure of quarter filling in the center , a compressible transition region and a large incompressible region of filling @xmath0 before vacuum . as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : harmonictrap ] this picture is well reproduced by the numeric simulation , where the local density @xmath147 reveals the cdw nature . to check the incompressibility of the phases",
    ", we calculated an averaged density @xmath148 .",
    "it illustrates the two density plateaus which lie within the extend predicted by the local chemical potential @xmath149 and the critical chemical potantials @xmath150 calculated in the previous section .",
    "the outer incompressible phase is the cdw state at filling @xmath0 we are mostly interested in , corresponding to a half - filled lowest bloch band .",
    "the inner incompressible phase at quarter - filling corresponds to a completely filled lowest bloch band , and is similar to the mott phase of bosons in the lowest band of the 1d su - schrieffer - heeger model @xcite .",
    "now we discuss the topological properties of the @xmath0 cdw phase .",
    "we distinguish two cases for the classification of the phase , the @xmath152d model where the second dimension is defined by the twist - angle @xmath153 , and the @xmath83d model at points of highest symmetry @xmath154 . in the first case ,",
    "robust topological properties carry over from the @xmath2 ln state from the 2d hofstadter - hubbard model . in the second case",
    ", the cdw constitutes a ( inversion- ) symmetry - protected topological phase ( spt ) which is not robust against disorder .",
    "the @xmath1 ln state in the 2d hofstadter - hubbard model is characterized by a fractionally quantized chern number @xmath126 @xcite , and as will be shown shortly this carries over to the @xmath152d gapped cdw state . before going through the details of the calculation ,",
    "however , let us give an intuitive physical picture .    as mentioned above , the chern number is directly related to the quantized hall current in the 2d model ( on a torus ) . if one unit of magnetic flux is introduced through the perimeter of the torus , i.e. @xmath155 , a quantized hall current around the torus is induced .",
    "while in the case of an integer - quantized chern number @xmath156 the state returns to itself immediately , when @xmath157 takes a fractional value the state returns to itself only after introduction of @xmath158 flux quanta , @xmath159 .",
    "as discussed in the non - interacting case , an integer - quantized thouless pump still exists in the thin - torus limit when the twist - angle @xmath3 is adiabatically increased .",
    "this mechanism carries over to the @xmath0 cdw , as can be understood from a simple gutzwiller - ansatz . to this end",
    "we approximate the cdw by a product state @xmath160 where @xmath161 creates a boson in the wannier orbital corresponding to unit - cell @xmath9 . to understand how the wannier orbitals depend on @xmath3 , we approximate them at the points of highest symmetry , @xmath162 . to this end we search for the state of lowest energy within each unit - cell , and note that in principle the residual coupling between unit - cells could be treated perturbatively .",
    "the result is illustrated in fig.[fig : thoulesspumporbitals ] . at @xmath142",
    "the hoppings are @xmath10 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 , such that wannier orbitals are localized on every other rung , with an energy of @xmath165 to zeroth order in the described perturbation theory . at @xmath166 on the other hand , the hoppings read @xmath10 and @xmath167 such that considering only rungs is not sufficient .",
    "instead we compare the energy of a particle hopping around a single four - site plaquette with zero and @xmath11 flux respectively . while in the latter case there are two degenerate states with energy @xmath168 , for vanishing flux we find a non - degenerate state with lower energy @xmath169 .",
    "although we consider only local hubbard - type interactions , the cdw state is stabilized by a finite gap @xmath170 to any excitations ( it can also be interpreted as a mott insulator ) .",
    "this is due to a hopping - induced finite range interaction . if we calculate the wannier orbitals beyond the zeroth order approximation introduced above , nearest and next - nearest neighbor orbitals acquire a finite overlap .",
    "thus , if the twist - angle @xmath3 is adiabatically changed , the state follows the modified wannier orbitals . because they re - connect to their neighbors after a full pumping cycle , see fig.[fig : thoulesspumporbitals ] , a quantized atomic current flows along the ladder . because  assuming periodic boundary conditions along @xmath52  the state only returns to itself after _ two _ full pumping cycles , the thouless pump is fractionally quantized , with a coefficient ( the chern number ) @xmath126 .",
    "this quantization is robust against any perturbations which are small compared to the gap @xmath170 .",
    "the thouless pump is also illustrated in fig.[fig : intro ] ( c ) .",
    "now we turn to a more formal topological classification of the @xmath152d model , following @xcite . to this end",
    "we calculate the many - body chern number of the @xmath0 cdw state . because periodic boundary conditions are required along the ladder ( in @xmath52-direction ) , we restrict our analysis in this section to exact diagonalization of small systems ( instead of performing dmrg calculations as before ) . before starting , we note that on a torus the cdw ground state is two - fold degenerate ( in thermodynamic limit @xmath171 ) , as expected from the topologically protected two - fold ground state degeneracy of the @xmath1 ln state in the 2d hofstadter model .",
    "naively this degeneracy can be understood in 1d from the obvious ambiguity in the choice of occupied orbitals in eq .",
    ": choosing odd orbitals instead , @xmath172 , yields an equivalent but orthogonal cdw state .",
    "we saw already in the discussion above , that @xmath173 can be adiabatically transformed into @xmath174 without closing the bulk gap by applying one full thouless pumping cycle .",
    "the many - body chern number is defined , in analogy to the single - particle case , by employing twisted boundary conditions . in the @xmath83d thin - torus limit model",
    "we thus have a @xmath84d parameter space spanned by the external parameter @xmath153 and the the twist angle @xmath175 of the @xmath83d ladder model .",
    "however , because the groundstate is two - fold degenerate ( for some values @xmath176 this is true even in a finite system ) , only the _ total _ chern number of both states can be defined .",
    "it can most conveniently be calculated as the winding of the @xmath177 wilson loop @xmath178 , which is a non - abelian generalization of the zak phase @xcite .",
    "it is defined via @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the non - abelian berry connection @xcite and @xmath181 denotes path - ordering .",
    "then its winding yields the _ total _ chern number @xmath182 , which divided by the number of degenerate states @xmath183  in our case @xmath184  yields the fractional chern number , @xmath185 the wilson loop phase can easily be evaluated numerically in a gauge - independent way , see e.g. @xcite , and in fig.[fig : manybodychern ] we show @xmath186 for the thin - torus model .",
    "we observe a winding by @xmath4 , which as expected results in a many - body chern number @xmath187 .      at special values of the twist angle",
    "@xmath166 the model is inversion - symmetric around the center of links on the legs of the ladder . in this case , the cdw phase can be understood as a spt phase @xcite . to come up with an elegant formal classification",
    ", the spontaneous breaking of inversion symmetry by the cdw has to be carefully accounted for .",
    "we postpone this issue to a forthcoming publication , where related models will be discussed . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the definition and calculation of a topological invariant @xmath188 , which is quantized to @xmath189 and protected by inversion symmetry .",
    "the topological invariant we employ is the many - body zak or berry phase defined by twisted boundary conditions along the ladder @xcite . like in the case of the chern number in the @xmath152d case ,",
    "we introduce the twist angle @xmath190 , however now the second parameter @xmath154 is fixed . in practice the most convenient way to implement twisted boundary conditions is to multiply the hopping elements from the last to the first sites of the ladder ( which realize periodic boundary conditions ) by the complex phase @xmath191 .",
    "then the eigenstate @xmath192 depends on @xmath190 and the berry phase can be calculated as usual , @xmath193 from inversion symmetry it follows that @xmath189 is strictly quantized @xcite .    to calculate the topological invariant @xmath188 , we restrict ourselves to the simple representation of the cdw state @xmath194 .",
    "then we distinguish four different cases , characterized by @xmath195 and by which of the two states @xmath173 and @xmath174 we use .",
    "to begin with we note that only for , say , @xmath143 the link with the complex phase @xmath191 is part of an atomic orbital , as defined in the discussion of fig.[fig : thoulesspumporbitals ] .",
    "then in the trivial case @xmath196 , @xmath194 is independent of @xmath190 and thus @xmath197 vanishes for both cdw states . for @xmath198 on the other hand , we have to distinguish between cdw and cdw. only for one of the two states ",
    "say for @xmath173  the link with the complex phase @xmath191 is part of an _ occupied _ atomic orbital .",
    "thus for the state described by cdw the wavefunction @xmath194 is independent of @xmath190 and @xmath197 again .",
    "finally we will show that the state cdw is topologically non - trivial with @xmath199 . to this end , note that there is an occupied atomic orbital on the link connecting the last and the first rung of the ladder .",
    "the energy of this orbital can not be changed by the complex phase @xmath191 , which is merely a gauge transformation , but the eigenfunction of the orbital @xmath200 ( with @xmath201 labeling the four sites ) , depends on @xmath190 .",
    "in fact , a simple calculation shows that the corresponding berry phase is @xmath202 . because @xmath173 is a simple product state it follows that @xmath199 in this case .",
    "in summary , we have proposed and analyzed a realistic setup for the realization of a topologically non - trivial cdw state ( at filling @xmath0 ) of strongly interacting bosons in a 1d ladder geometry .",
    "our model was derived by taking the thin - torus limit of the 2d hofstadter - hubbard model at flux @xmath18 per plaquette .",
    "the @xmath2 laughlin - type fractional chern insulator in this 2d model is directly related to the 1d cdw at filling @xmath0 . as a consequence ,",
    "the cdw has interesting topological properties : when adiabatically introducing magnetic flux @xmath203 through the small perimeter of the thin torus , which can be realized by changing the hoppings in our model , a fractionally quantized hall current is induced along the ladder .",
    "alternatively , the cdw phase can be interpreted as inversion symmetry - protected topological phase , characterized by a quantized topological invariant taking values @xmath189 .",
    "we used dmrg calculations to determine the particle - hole gap of the cdw and found values of @xmath204 , a sizable fraction of the bare hopping @xmath10 .",
    "when placed in a harmonic trap , the wedding cake structure of the density provides a clear signature of the appearance of the topological cdw state .    investigating the thin - torus limit of fractional chern insulators is a promising route to gain understanding of more complicated , but closely related , topologically ordered states in 2d systems @xcite . in this work",
    "we showed how the thin - torus limit can be realized experimentally with ultracold atoms , including the possibility of fully tunable twisted boundary conditions .",
    "similar ideas can be carried over to photonic systems , where synthetic gauge fields can also be implemented @xcite and strong non - linearities on a single - photon level are realized e.g. using rydberg atoms @xcite .",
    "therefore an interesting future direction for such experiments would be the observation of more complicated thin - torus models , going beyond the analogue of the simple @xmath1 ln state and including for instance states related to the non - abelian read - rezayi series @xcite .",
    "once a system like the one described in this paper is realized , an important question is how to witness its topological properties .",
    "the quantized transport connected to the chern number could be measured by taking in - situ images of the atomic cloud .",
    "a more direct measurement of the topological invariant would be desirable , which should also be able to measure the invariant @xmath188 characterizing the symmetry - protected topological order .",
    "such measurements have been performed in non - interacting systems @xcite using a combination of ramsey - interferometry and bloch oscillations , and they could be extended to interacting systems in the future .",
