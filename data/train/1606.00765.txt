    "since the 1960 s , muon colliders ( mc ) @xcite and neutrino factories ( nf ) @xcite , based on high brilliance muon beams , have been proposed .",
    "their design has been optimized in references @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite and @xcite .",
    "while a mc addresses the high - energy frontier : looking at precise higgs physics @xcite and beyond , a nf will provide the ultimate tool for neutrino oscillation studies , looking at cp - violation .",
    "the current design of a nf or a mc front - end is similar , up to the beginning of the cooling section , as can be seen from the layouts reported in figure [ fig : mc - nf ] .",
    "-0.2 cm   0.5 cm     mc s may be developed with c.m.s energy up to many tev and , due to the large @xmath1 mass as compared to the electron one , may easily fit in the footprint of existing hep laboratories   tev muon collider ( @xmath2 higgs factory ) has a ring circumference of @xmath3 km , to be compared to the @xmath4 km of the lhc tunnel . ]",
    "s - channel scalar higgs production is greatly enhanced in a @xmath5 collider ( as respect to @xmath6 ) as the coupling is proportional to the lepton mass .",
    "precision measurements in the higgs sector are thus feasible : at @xmath7 gev/@xmath8 only a @xmath9 collider may directly measure the @xmath10 lineshape . with an integrated luminosity of 0.5 fb@xmath11 , the @xmath10 mass may be determined , in the standard model case , with a precision of 0.1 mev@xmath12 and its width @xmath13 mev@xmath12 ) with a precision of 0.5 mev@xmath12 .    through the processes @xmath14 and @xmath15 , neutrino beams with a flux known at better than @xmath16 and well - known composition ( @xmath17 or @xmath18 , @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) may be produced in a nf @xcite .",
    "the `` golden channel '' linked to @xmath21 ( or @xmath22 ) oscillations , manifests itself by wrong sign muons , as respect to initial beam charge , suggesting the use of large magnetized far detectors .",
    "after the experimental discovery of a large @xmath23 value , @xmath24 , the design of the nf has been revised to improve precision in the study of sub - leading effects in neutrino oscillations and provide better capabilities for the measurement of the phase @xmath25 , if leptonic cp - violation occurs @xcite .",
    "many r@xmath26d issues are relevant for the development of a nf or a mc , such as the availability of a suitable proton driver or a high - power target , but the most critical one is still the muon cooling .",
    "muons are produced as tertiary particles in the process chain @xmath27 and thus occupy a large longitudinal and transverse phase space .",
    "conventional accelerator technologies require input beams with small phase space . to alleviate this problem one may use either new large aperture accelerators , such as `` fixed field alternating - gradient '' ( ffag ) machines @xcite or try to reduce ( `` cool '' ) the incoming muon beam phase space . while for a nf",
    "the required cooling factor is small : around 2.4 for the 75 m cooling section in the ids - nf design @xcite , @xcite , for a mc a longitudinal emittance reduction @xmath28 and a transverse emittance reduction @xmath29 in both transverse coordinates are needed , requiring a total cooling factor @xmath30 .",
    "conventional beam cooling methods do not work on the short timescale of the muon lifetime ( @xmath31s ) .",
    "the only effective way is the so - called `` ionization cooling '' that is accomplished by passing muons through a low - z absorber , where they loose energy by ionization and the longitudinal component of momentum is then replenished by rf cavities @xcite .",
    "the initial goal of the mice experiment  @xcite to study a fully engineered cooling cell of the proposed us study 2  @xcite , has been downsized in 2014 to a demonstration of ionization cooling with a simplified lattice based on the available rf cavities and absorber - focus coils ( see the top panel of figure 2 ) .",

    "the mice beamline has been characterized by the use of the tof detectors ( with @xmath33 ps resolution ) , with data taken mainly in summer 2010 @xcite . as conventional emittance measurement techniques",
    "reach barely a @xmath34 precision , the final measure of emittance will be done in mice on a particle - by - particle basis by measuring @xmath35 with the trackers and the tof system . foreseen performances of the mice cooling cell",
    "are shown in the bottom panel of figure 2 .      both a reduction in transverse emittance and longitudinal emittance",
    "are needed for a @xmath2 higgs factory or a multi - tev collider , as shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : wedge ] from reference @xcite . as a direct longitudinal cooling",
    "is not feasible , due to the energy - loss straggling that increases the energy spread , the only practical solution is to transfer a fraction of the cooling effect from transverse to longitudinal phase space ( via `` emittance exchange '' ) , as shown schematically in figure [ fig : wedge ] .",
    "dispersion is used to create an appropriate correlation between momentum and transverse position / path length .",
    "clearly this is at the expense of a reduced transverse cooling .",
    "some aspects of the `` emittance exchange '' will be addressed also in the mice experiment , by inserting lih wedge absorbers .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    one may envisage multi - pass cooling rings @xcite and then extract the cooled beams , with a substantial cost reduction , instead of single - pass linear cooling channels , as in mice .",
    "these designs are based on solenoidal focussing strictly interleaved with rf accelerating cavities @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "difficult beam dynamics must be handled and performance limits or cost - effectiveness are not completely defined . in a multi - turn cooling ring",
    ", the main problems will be connected to beam injection and extraction .",
    "the recent discovery of the standard model higgs at about 126 gev has revived the interest for a compact muon collider : the higgs - factory . as cooling factors up to @xmath36",
    "are needed for a mc , the optimization of the cooling channel is essential .",
    "a vigorous @xmath37 program is thus needed .",
