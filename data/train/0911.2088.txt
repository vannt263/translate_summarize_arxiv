    "thermally driven flows near liquid interfaces continue to be an active area of research since the first experimental studies by h. bnard over 100 years ago .",
    "they are characterized by a multitude of interacting physical mechanisms and display a large variety of regular and complex flow patterns .",
    "experimental and theoretical studies of such flows have stimulated and accompanied the development of the theory of pattern formation and nonlinear phenomena in general .",
    "recent developments are summarized in a number of monographs and review papers ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the driving forces in these thermally driven flows are surface - tension gradients ( marangoni forces ) and buoyancy forces , which originate from the temperature dependency of surface tension and density , respectively .",
    "both mechanisms are classically studied in convection taking place within a finite layer subjected to a steady temperature difference : for the buoyancy - driven case , this is the celebrated rayleigh - bnard convection formulated by @xcite , for the surface - tension driven case this is the bnard - marangoni convection studied by @xcite . in both cases , a certain critical temperature difference must be applied in order to sustain convective motion .",
    "the theoretical predictions for such critical temperature differences are in excellent agreement with experiments ( @xcite ) .",
    "thermal convection can also appear when the external conditions are time - dependent , e.g. by a modulation or abrupt change of cooling or heating . in this case , the basic conductive temperature distribution is time dependent , and the stability problem becomes a non - autonomous one , i.e. the solution can not in general be sought in the form of exponentials @xmath0 . for time - periodic modulation of the basic state one can resort to floquet theory ( @xcite ) but , in the general case , the formulation and prediction of critical conditions for the onset of convection becomes much less clear - cut than for a steady base state .",
    "the following two basic approaches are common for a general , time - dependent basic state :    * reduction to an autonomous problem by the _ frozen - time assumption _ , whereby the basic state is supposed to evolve much more slowly than the perturbations , and * solution of the full non - autonomous linear perturbation problem for some initial conditions which are supposed to be representative .",
    "this is called _ amplification theory _ ( denoted by at in the following ) .",
    "both approaches go at least back to the 1960s .",
    "the first one was used by @xcite and @xcite and the second by @xcite . later work by @xcite introduced energy stability ideas , but the resulting bounds are not necessarily useful for predicting instability thresholds and the mathematics is considerably more involved . in each of these",
    "works the focus was on buoyancy - driven convection .",
    "the frozen - time approach was used for the marangoni convection by @xcite .",
    "these authors studied the dynamics of a fluid layer subjected to a sudden change in surface temperature .",
    "however the frozen - time method was only applied for late times in the evolution . for early times",
    "they formulated the so - called propagation theory , whereby the problem is again reduced to an autonomous one by using a certain similarity solution for base state and perturbations .",
    "this approximation is actually appropriate for an infinite layer .",
    "the frozen - time model relies on the validity of the assumption of fast instability development ( relative to the base state ) .",
    "this could be inadequate at instability thresholds , at which the instability can develop on the same time scales as the base state .",
    "the other method namely the amplification model , has a sounder mathematical foundation , but comes with the necessity of identifying representative initial conditions and amplification levels for the perturbations .",
    "a specific analysis suitable for transient problems is developed in this paper , which is an extension of the previous amplification model .",
    "the underlying concept is called the non - normal approach . in such a case ,",
    "the choice of initial perturbations is not somewhat arbitrary as in at but it is guided by an optimization technique .",
    "this procedure consists in identifying , for a given time @xmath1 and a given wavenumber @xmath2 , the initial perturbation with the strongest amplification ( called the optimal perturbation ) .",
    "hence this method may exhibit initial conditions which are not a priori obvious configurations . as a consequence it gives the maximal value for the perturbation norm that was previously defined for the problem under study .",
    "this can not be achieved through an at simulation .",
    "concerning the determination of initial conditions , we note that the non - normal approach has also been used for instability problems of steady base flow , e.g. in parallel shear flows , such as boundary layers ( @xcite ) or plane poiseuille flow  ( @xcite ) . for such problems",
    ", there was a long - standing gap between the standard two - dimensional tollmien - schlichting modes obtained using the classical normal mode analysis  though these modes were only observed in some very controlled experiments  and the general experimental observation of streak generation .",
    "it is by resorting to non - normal mode analysis that the coherent structures observed in boundary layer transition , i.e. streamwise rolls and streaks , could be deduced from an optimal approach and their generation linked to the lift - up mechanism proposed by landahl ( @xcite ) .",
    "the non - normal approach can be extended to transient cases .",
    "this is precisely what we propose here .",
    "such a method provides the strongest amplification , i.e. the optimal growth at a given duration @xmath3 after initial conditions have started their evolution .",
    "if this amplification is sufficiently large , the optimal perturbations may result in the modification of the basic flow at time @xmath3 and we can speak of an unstable regime in a way to be defined by a norm . to the best of our knowledge , this approach is the only one capable to provide clear - cut answers on instability problems for truly unsteady basic flows .",
    "however , as mentioned by one referee , this definition of the stability condition is blurred owing to a certain arbitrariness in choosing the norm and defining the critical amplification gain .",
    "this is inherent to any unsteady linear stability problem and does not depend on the particular method .",
    "it is then more suitable to view the results as the estimation of a transition region between a domain exhibiting strong convection and a domain where initial perturbations are damped or have no time to significantly develop during the transient regime .",
    "the non - normal approach allows one to characterize this transition domain properly .",
    "the results presented here for different norms and different critical amplification values show that this transition region is thin , so that the notion of stability threshold is still valid for this transient problem . on the contrary , the frozen - time assumption may fail , for instance if the base state evolves on the same time scale or faster then the unstable modes characterizing its frozen - time stability . in that case",
    ", the computed growth rates might not correspond to any true amplifications , at the system time scale .",
    "this might affect the determination of critical conditions  .",
    "however the pertinent character of this method stongly depends on the rapid variation of these `` quasi - static growth rates '' with the basic state changes . for instance , the amplification between times @xmath4 and @xmath5 would be , at zeroth order wkb theory , equal to @xmath6 .",
    "so if the instantaneous growth rate strongly varies during this interval , its positive value at a given moment may not be interpreted in the right way . ] .    in the present work ,",
    "we provide the results obtained by means of the non - normal approach as well as the frozen - time approach . in the specific flow case presented here ,",
    "the quasi - static method is shown to provide similar results except for some particular quantities .",
    "the proposed analysis is general and can be easily extended to many other unsteady problems , e.g. , chemically driven hydrodynamic instabilities ( @xcite ) . in the present paper , we determine the onset of convection in a drying experiment , which leads to an unsteady bnard - marangoni problem .",
    "more specifically we study the sudden cooling due to evaporation of a liquid layer , where the decrease of surface temperature is induced by the vaporization latent heat .",
    "this problem has been the subject of many experimental or theoretical studies ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , and more recently @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "the specific motivation for our work is the drying process studied in experiments by  @xcite performed on a polymer solution ( polyisobutylene / toluene ) .",
    "the solution initially at the ambient temperature is poured in a dish located in an extractive hood .",
    "when evaporation of toluene begins , convective patterns are observed at the very beginning of the experiment ( quasi - instantaneous or less than 100  s after pouring the solution ) .",
    "they disappear well before the end of the drying .",
    "the very large lewis number @xmath7 ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the thermal and mass diffusivity ) of the polymer solution ( about @xmath10 ) is an indication that the thermal diffusion is faster and that convective patterns observed in the first minutes should be mainly driven by thermal effects .",
    "two experimental observations detailed in @xcite support this thesis .",
    "first , a few experiments were conducted with deuterated solvent , whose density is higher than the polymer density . in that case , the density of the solution decreases when the polymer concentration increases , leading to a stable situation if the solutal rayleigh - bnard problem is considered .",
    "since no differences were found with the experiments conducted with the standard solvent , we can exclude solutal buoyancy as a dominant mechanism .",
    "second , free surface temperature fields measured by infrared camera showed that the end of free convection was related to the duration of the transient thermal regime . in these free convection experiments it can be inferred from the work on steady convection by @xcite , that the marangoni effect is dominant for thicknesses typically less than 1 cm and the buoyancy dominant for higher thicknesses . for a more accurate description of the experiments see  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : equations ] , we present the basic assumptions of the model and the governing equations . thereafter the unsteady basic state is described and a specific stability analysis is introduced in section [ linearoptimal ] . in particular",
    "the non - normal method is explained and the choice of norms is discussed .",
    "section [ results ] contains the main numerical findings for the two limiting situations : the pure rayleigh - bnard and the pure marangoni case .",
    "critical conditions for the optimal modes are presented .",
    "part of these numerical results are also obtained by a scaling analysis .",
    "a comparison of this method with the frozen time approach is also performed .",
    "finally , in section [ experiment ] , the comparison with experimental results is discussed .",
    "the mathematical model of rayleigh - bnard - marangoni convection used throughout this paper is based on a one - layer model in which three assumptions are made : ( 1 ) the upper surface remains planar , ( 2 ) the layer thickness @xmath11 remains constant , ( 3 ) the heat and mass fluxes across the upper surface are given by transfer coefficients .",
    "moreover our analysis is restricted to fluids characterized by a prandtl number @xmath12 with @xmath13 the kinematic viscosity .",
    "this turns out to be the case of most liquids ( including water and organic solvents ) . in that instance , the thermal diffusion time scale is always larger than the viscous diffusion time scale .    the first hypothesis can be tested as follows .",
    "two modes of instability are known to occur in the bnard - marangoni problem ( @xcite ) .",
    "one is generated from the interaction of the velocity perturbations with the basic temperature , while the other mode , characterized by a wavelength long compared with the layer thickness , is due to the coupling of the marangoni effect with the deflection of the free surface .",
    "mathematically , surface deformation can be neglected on scales of order @xmath11 when the laplace pressure associated with a curvature @xmath14 is large compared with the dynamic pressure .",
    "this condition ( @xcite ) corresponds with the smallness of the crispation number @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively denote fluid density and surface tension .",
    "moreover , the galileo number @xmath18 characterizes the relative importance of gravity ( @xmath19 gravity constant ) and diffusion .",
    "a large value of the galileo number indicates that gravity stabilizes the long - wave mode .",
    "the free surface deformation can be neglected if @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "such conditions are shown be satisfied for the experiments considered here .",
    "the second hypothesis can be adopted if @xmath22 , where the peclet number @xmath23 is defined as the ratio between @xmath24 the interface velocity due to evaporation which is equal to minus the time derivative of @xmath25 , and the thermal velocity scale @xmath26 .",
    "indeed when @xmath22 , the surface displacement @xmath27 remains negligible compared to the total thickness @xmath28 during the problem characteristic time i.e. the diffusion time @xmath29 . in the experiment  ( see section [ experiment ] ) , the peclet number is smaller than @xmath30 .    finally let us discuss the third assumption .",
    "the boundary condition at the free surface results from the coupling between the system and its surroundings . in evaporation experiments ,",
    "the solvent flux and thus the temperature gradient in the fluid depends on the heat and mass transfer with the ambient air .",
    "several authors have developed numerical or theoretical studies taking into account this coupling , see for example @xcite . in this paper",
    "we adopt a simple description by global heat and mass transfer coefficients , as our main interest is directed on the transient character of the problem under study and not on the detailed description of the transfer per se .",
    "we formulate the basic equations in a cartesian coordinate system , where the bottom of the layer coincides with the plane @xmath31 and the upper free surface with @xmath32 .",
    "the fluid is characterized by a density @xmath16 , a kinematic viscosity @xmath13 , a thermal diffusivity @xmath8 and a thermal expansion coefficient @xmath33 .",
    "the boussinesq approximation is assumed to govern the velocity field @xmath34 and temperature field @xmath3 @xmath35 where @xmath19 denotes the acceleration due to gravity and @xmath36 the temperature of the ambient air . in this approximation ,",
    "the density @xmath16 is taken to be the density at @xmath37 . at the bottom , the velocity satisfies the no - slip condition and the wall is assumed adiabatic since , in the experiment , the bottom of the dish is thermally insulated by an air gap . @xmath38",
    "the upper boundary conditions are more involved . assuming a planar surface",
    ", the local evaporation mass flux reads @xmath39 moreover the global mass balance reads ( no fluid is introduced to counterbalance the evaporation mass loss ) @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the mean evaporation flux over the free surface . from relations [ chirie1 ] and [ chirie2 ] we get : @xmath42 if we assume that the flux variations @xmath43 are much smaller than the flux @xmath44 itself , then @xmath45 , the peclet number being defined using the evaporation velocity ( see section 2.1 ) . since @xmath22 and @xmath46 is the velocity scale , the kinematic boundary condition so reduces to @xmath47 in addition , the balance of tangential forces at the upper surface requires that the velocity field satisfies @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the temperature inside the fluid layer at @xmath32 and @xmath50 denotes the surface tension which is assumed to be a linearly decreasing function of temperature , @xmath51    finally , the conservation of energy flux should be imposed at the interface .",
    "it reads : @xmath52    the first l.h.s .",
    "term represents the heat conduction in the liquid , @xmath53 denoting the thermal conductivity related to the thermal diffusivity _ via _ @xmath54 with @xmath55 the liquid specific heat .",
    "the second l.h.s .",
    "term expresses the heat flux density in the gas using a simple phenomenological model based on the heat transfer coefficient @xmath56 and the difference between the air temperature @xmath57 far from the liquid and the surface temperature @xmath49 .",
    "finally the cooling effect due to solvent vaporization is expressed in the r.h.s .",
    "term , where @xmath58 stands for the latent heat of vaporization and @xmath59 for the solvent mass flux per unit area .",
    "this latter quantity depends on the surface temperature @xmath60 . in the framework of the one - layer model ,",
    "one imposes @xmath61 where @xmath62 ( resp .",
    "@xmath63 ) denotes the solvent concentration in the gas phase near the surface ( resp .",
    "far from the surface ) and @xmath64 is the phenomenological mass transfer coefficient in the gas . assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium , @xmath62 directly depends on the surface temperature through the saturated vapour pressure .",
    "the variable @xmath59 can be linearized around @xmath57 which leads to the final expression : @xmath65    initially the liquid layer is isothermal i.e. @xmath66 .",
    "at large times , the system reaches a steady state in which the temperature in the layer is again uniform but with a temperature difference @xmath67 with the gas located far from the surface .",
    "this difference is imposed by the condition ( [ model - alphamodel ] ) , where @xmath68 to put the above equations in a non - dimensional form , scales for temperature , length , velocity and time are needed .",
    "the temperature difference @xmath69 provides the temperature scale and the layer thickness @xmath11 the relevant length scale .",
    "two velocity scales can be introduced in this problem namely the viscous velocity scale @xmath70 and the thermal velocity scale @xmath71 . here",
    "only the thermal scale @xmath71 is used .",
    "finally the appropriate time scale is the thermal diffusion time @xmath72 .",
    "the non - dimensionalization leads to equations for @xmath73 and @xmath74 : @xmath75 in which the rayleigh , marangoni , prandtl and biot numbers @xmath76 appear .    in the following",
    ", we discriminate between two opposite cases : @xmath77 or @xmath78 .",
    "this corresponds respectively to an effective conductance @xmath79 in the gas much smaller or much larger than the heat conductance @xmath80 in the fluid .",
    "we study the stability of a purely conductive unsteady basic state @xmath81 which is initially uniform i.e. @xmath82 .",
    "this state evolves since the upper free surface is cooled down by the latent heat released through evaporation : the velocity field remains always zero but the unsteady field @xmath83 satisfies a pure heat equation @xmath84 the basic state only depends on the biot number @xmath85 .",
    "note that the term @xmath86 characterizes the heat transfer in the gas phase and the term @xmath87 represents the cooling effect due to evaporation .",
    "the unsteady temperature field @xmath83 is shown in figure  [ basictemperature ] for different biot numbers and times .",
    "a cooled layer develops from the upper surface whose thickness @xmath88 is similar at a given time for different biot numbers and increases until it fills the whole layer .",
    "conversely , if @xmath89 denotes the characteristic temperature difference within the fluid , the maximum reached over the whole time evolution by this quantity increases with biot number @xmath85 ( figure  [ basictemperature]d ) .",
    "actually , two different regimes are observed according to the value of @xmath85 . for small biot numbers , typically @xmath90 , the cooled layer reaches the bottom while the jump @xmath91 is less than one .",
    "afterwards , @xmath91 decreases .",
    "such time evolution can be summarized by the following scalings @xmath92 @xmath93 , the temperature field @xmath94 relaxes towards the steady uniform temperature @xmath95 and all the energy needed by evaporation is carried on by convection in the gas phase .    for large biot numbers , typically @xmath96 ,",
    "the temperature jump @xmath89 reaches a maximum before the cooled layer reaches the bottom ( figure [ basictemperature]a ) . in that case",
    ", the maximal jump is equal to one and @xmath97 at that time .",
    "the time evolution can be summarized by the following scalings : @xmath98 for @xmath99 , the temperature decreases in the whole layer thickness to reach the steady state regime @xmath95 .      to quantify the amplification gain at time @xmath4 , it is customary to define a norm which is generally based on the kinetic energy of perturbations .",
    "this norm can be orthogonally decomposed in a fourier basis so that the individual contributions of each wavenumber  @xmath2 can be studied independently . in the present case",
    ", the temperature field is playing a major role as well .",
    "we thus define two different norms corresponding to two different situations . the first one is based on the kinetic energy of perturbations @xmath106 where superscript @xmath107 denotes complex conjugation . the integration is performed over the entire layer width and perturbations",
    "are obtained after integrating the above linear system over the time period @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "the second one @xmath109 is based on the temperature field and not the velocity field .    for finite prandtl number two extreme cases",
    "are considered , with the initial perturbation concerning either the velocity field , or the temperature field . in",
    "the following we will consider the amplification factors @xmath110 or @xmath111 to characterize the stability . then , when the initial perturbations only concern the velocity field , we only take into account the amplification @xmath110 since @xmath112 .",
    "conversely , when the initial perturbations only concern the temperature field we use the amplification factor @xmath111 . for the infinite prandtl number case ,",
    "the velocity perturbations are not dynamical quantities since the time derivative of the velocity drops out from equations ( [ direct1])-([direct3 ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the velocity perturbations are slaved to the temperature perturbations . in this case",
    ", we use only @xmath113 and hence the norm @xmath114 .",
    "for the unsteady basic state @xmath83 , a given set @xmath136 , and a given type of initial perturbation ( temperature or velocity ) , the non - modal analysis determines at a given time @xmath4 , the maximum energy amplification @xmath137 over all possible perturbations of wavenumber @xmath2 ( see figure [ dispersionrelation ] ) . in a way , the value @xmath138 is analogous to a growth rate for classical stability analysis .",
    "more generally , it appears possible to extend the usual concepts of classical stability analysis to unsteady flows .",
    "for instance , @xmath139 can be maximized over wavenumber @xmath2 and time @xmath4 providing the global maximum amplification @xmath140 ( see figure [ maxiampli ] ) .",
    "this value is reached at time @xmath141 , for an optimal wavenumber denoted by @xmath142 and for a specific perturbation structure in @xmath143 .",
    "these latter two quantities play the role of the most amplified wavenumber and of the most amplified mode for the standard stability analysis .",
    "one also obtains a `` stability '' diagram , by determining the region of the space @xmath144 where the amplification gets above a threshold @xmath145 .",
    "it is a way of separating the region where amplification or attenuation occurs .",
    "the value of @xmath145 , for instance @xmath146 , is somewhat arbitrary : as already said in the introduction , an unsteady problem is indeed characterized more by a transition domain than a well defined threshold .",
    "it is demonstrated below that choosing @xmath146 or @xmath147 does not result in major differences , so that the transition region is thin compared with the absolute values of the marangoni and rayleigh numbers . for fixed @xmath148 and @xmath149",
    ", one can determine the curve @xmath150 such that if @xmath151 ( resp .",
    "@xmath152 ) then @xmath153 ( resp .",
    "@xmath154 ) .",
    "similarly one may define for fixed @xmath155 and @xmath149 , the curve @xmath156 .",
    "these curves play a role very much similar to marginal stability curves .",
    "each point of the critical curve is associated to a critical wavenumber @xmath157 and critical optimal time @xmath158 .",
    "note that until this point , most of this procedure can be extended to other unsteady problems in a straightforward way .",
    "a comparison between these critical curves and the experimental diagram that separates the domains where convection is observed or not observed , is made in section [ experiment ] .      for infinite prandtl number ,",
    "the velocity is slaved to the temperature field . as a consequence ,",
    "only perturbations in temperature field are pertinent . in the plane",
