    "in the recent papers @xcite in the framework of @xmath0 model we have demonstrated very strong d - wave pairing between dressed quasiholes induced by spin - wave exchange .",
    "the pairing gives critical temperature in a reasonable agreement with experimental data for copper oxide superconductors .",
    "in general terms our approach follows the studies , of monthoux , pines , scarlapino , schriffer , and others , supporting idea of the magnetic fluctuations mechanism of pairing@xcite . for calculations we have used bcs - like approximation for dressed quasiholes .",
    "a similar approach to the pairing of dressed quasiholes has been used by dagotto , nazarenko , and moreo @xcite .",
    "the important difference is that in our work@xcite the hole - hole interaction is derived from the parameters of the t - j model , while in @xcite it is introduced _",
    "ad hoc _ with magnitude adjusted to fit experimental data .",
    "we consider the holes as well as spin - waves moving in the background with long - range antiferromagnetic ( af ) order .",
    "it means that we assume that the af order is preserved at distances smaller than inverse fermi momentum @xmath5 .",
    "it is widely believed that this assumption is correct and present work confirms this point .",
    "it is also widely believed that correct spin structure of the ground state should be of the type of anderson spin - liquid state@xcite . for @xmath0 model the instability of long - range af order together with normal - hole fermi liquid",
    "was probably first pointed out by shraiman and siggia@xcite .",
    "later it has been demonstrated in numerous works ( e.g. see refs .",
    "it is due to the strong interaction of spin - waves with mobile holes .",
    "however , a structure of the ground state as well as a spectrum of excitations was not understood , and spin - liquid state was not derived .",
    "now we understand that we have to consider a hole - fermi - liquid with superconducting pairing which interacts with long - range fluctuations of af ordering .",
    "physical difference of the paired fermi - liquid from normal one is stiffness of the former . in the present work",
    "we demonstrate that the long - range af order is also destroyed , but pairing is preserved .",
    "we derive explicitly the spin - liquid state of the system .",
    "we show that selfconsistent translation invariant spin - liquid solution exists at doping @xmath6 . using this solution",
    "we calculate spin - wave pseudo - gap @xmath2 , magnetic correlation length @xmath3 and static magnetic formfactor @xmath7 . in general terms",
    "the results which we derive here in the framework of @xmath0 model are very close to the picture of magnetic state discussed in the works of chubukov , pines , sachdev , sokol , and ye@xcite .",
    "the paper has the following structure . in sec.ii",
    "we present the effective hamiltonian of @xmath0 model and discuss pairing of holes .",
    "in sec.iii we formulate the idea of our approach presenting the simplified calculation of spin - wave green s function .",
    "sec.iv presents calculation of spin - wave polarization operator . in sec.v spin - wave green s function is calculated .",
    "we also discuss the pseudo - gap in spin - wave spectrum .",
    "sec.vi presents calculations of magnetic correlation length @xmath3 and static magnetic formfactor @xmath4 .",
    "finally our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "the @xmath8-@xmath9 model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the creation operator of a hole with spin @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) at site @xmath14 on a two - dimensional square lattice .",
    "the @xmath11 operators act in the hilbert space with no double electron occupancy .",
    "the spin operator is @xmath15@xmath12@xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 are the nearest - neighbour sites on the lattice .",
    "below we set @xmath9 as well as lattice spacing equal to unity .    at",
    "half - filling ( one hole per site ) @xmath8-@xmath9 model is equivalent to the heisenberg af model@xcite which has long - range af order in the ground state@xcite .",
    "let us denote the wave function of this ground state by @xmath18 .",
    "this is undoped system .",
    "we consider the doped system basing on the ground state of undoped one . in spite of destruction of the long - range",
    "af order it is convenient to use @xmath18 and corresponding quasiparticle excitations as a basis set in the problem with doping .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for @xmath0 model in terms of these quasiparticles was derived in the papers@xcite @xmath19 it is expressed in terms of usual spin - waves on af background @xmath20 ( see e.g. review@xcite ) , and composite hole operators @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the summations over @xmath23 and @xmath24 are restricted inside the brillouin zone of one sublattice where @xmath25 .",
    "spin - wave dispersion is @xmath26    single hole properties are well established ( for a review see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "wave function of a single hole can be represented as @xmath27 . at large @xmath8 the composite hole operator @xmath28 has complex structure .",
    "for example at @xmath29 the weight of bare hole in @xmath30 is about 25% , the weight of configurations `` bare hole + 1 magnon '' is @xmath3150% , and of configurations `` bare hole + 2 or more magnons '' @xmath3125% .",
    "dressed hole is a normal fermion .",
    "hole energy @xmath32 has minima at @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "for @xmath35 the dispersion can be well approximated by the expression@xcite @xmath36 the decimals in this formula are some combinations of the heisenberg model spin correlators . constant @xmath37 defines reference level for the energy . to find @xmath32 with respect to undoped system one has to set @xmath38 .",
    "however for present work it is convenient to set @xmath39 , and therefore @xmath40 . the coefficient @xmath41 is small and therefore the dispersion is almost degenerate along the face of the magnetic brillouin zone @xmath42 . according to refs .",
    "@xcite @xmath43 at @xmath44 .",
    "to avoid misunderstanding we note that formula ( [ hdisp ] ) certainly is not valid for very large @xmath8 where the hole band width is saturated at the value of the order of unity and does not increase with @xmath8 .",
    "however physically we are interested in @xmath45 ( e.g. , see refs.@xcite ) where ( [ hdisp ] ) works well . near the band minima",
    "@xmath46 the dispersion ( [ hdisp ] ) can be presented in the usual quadratic form @xmath47 where @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) is the projection of @xmath50 on the direction orthogonal ( parallel ) to the face of the magnetic brillouin zone ( fig.1 ) . from eq.([hdisp ] ) for @xmath51 we find @xmath52 , hence the mass anisotropy is @xmath53 .",
    "the interaction of a composite hole with spin waves is of the form ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the parameters of bogoliubov transformation diagonalizing spin - wave hamiltonian .",
    "the hole spin - wave coupling constant @xmath57 is a function of @xmath8 evaluated in the work@xcite . for large @xmath8 the coupling",
    "constant is @xmath8-independent @xmath58 .",
    "let us stress that even for @xmath59 the quasihole - spin - wave interaction ( [ hsw ] ) has the same form as for @xmath60 ( _ i.e. _ as for bare hole operators ) with an added renormalization factor ( of the order @xmath61 for @xmath62 ) .",
    "this remarkable property of the @xmath8-@xmath9 model is due to the absence of single loop correction to the hole - spin - wave vertex .",
    "it was first stated implicitly by kane , lee , and read@xcite . in refs.@xcite",
    "it was explicitly demonstrated that the vertex corrections with different kinematic structure are of the order of few percent at @xmath63 .",
    "there is also some @xmath64-dependence of the coupling constant @xmath57 . for example @xmath65 at @xmath66 ( see refs .",
    "however this dependence is weak , it is practically beyond the accuracy of the calculation of the renormalized value of @xmath57 .",
    "therefore we neglect this dependence .",
    "finally there is contact hole - hole interaction @xmath67 in the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) .",
    "@xmath67 is discussed in details in the refs.@xcite .",
    "it is proportional to some function @xmath68 . for small @xmath8",
    "this function approaches the value -0.25 , which gives the well known hole - hole attraction induced by the reduction of the number of missing antiferromagnetic links .",
    "however for realistic superconductors @xmath69 ( see e.g.refs.@xcite ) .",
    "surprisingly function @xmath68 vanishes exactly at @xmath69 , and it means that the mechanism of contact hole - hole attraction is switched off .",
    "in contrast the spin - wave exchange mechanism @xmath70 is negligible for small @xmath8 where @xmath71 , and it is most important at large @xmath8 where @xmath57 approaches 2 .",
    "we are interested in `` physical '' values of @xmath8 : @xmath45 .",
    "therefore in the present work we neglect contact interaction ( @xmath72 ) and consider only the hole - spin - wave interaction at @xmath73 .",
    "corresponding value of @xmath57 according to@xcite is @xmath74 .",
    "the interaction which gives hole - hole superconducting pairing arises from spin - wave exchange ( fig.2 ) . from ( [ heff ] )",
    "we find @xmath75 where @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is the energy of quasihole excitation above the bcs ground state ( see below ) .",
    "we consider the interaction in static approximation .",
    "justification of this approximation is as follows . at small hole concentration @xmath78",
    ", the holes are localized in momentum space in the vicinity of the minima of the band @xmath79 and fermi surface consists of ellipses .",
    "the fermi energy and fermi momentum of non - interacting holes are @xmath80 the fermi momentum @xmath81 is measured from the center of corresponding ellipse . in pairing ,",
    "the exchange of spin - waves with typical momenta @xmath82 is the most important ( see also refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the energy of such spin wave is much higher than the typical energy of a cooper pair @xmath83 this justifies the static approximation ( [ vkk ] ) for hole - hole interaction ( see also comment at end of section v ) .",
    "this is much different from usual phonon induced pairing where debye s frequency is much lower than the fermi energy .    with trial function of ground state",
    "@xmath84 we get conventional bcs equation for superconducting gap @xmath85 @xmath86 where @xmath87 , and @xmath88 is chemical potential fixed by equation @xmath89 all details of approximate analytical and exact numerical solutions of equation ( [ bcs ] ) are discussed in our papers@xcite .",
    "this equation has an infinite set of solutions of different symmetries with strongest pairing in the d - wave ( four nodes of the gap at the face of magnetic brillouin zone ) . for further discussion",
    "we need only the results for d - wave .",
    "all numerical values are calculated at @xmath73 , @xmath90 , and @xmath74 . in table",
    "i we present for different values of hole concentration 1)fermi energy @xmath91 , 2)chemical potential at zero temperature @xmath92 , 3)maximum value of the gap in brillouin zone at zero temperature @xmath93 , 4)maximum value of the gap at fermi surface at zero temperature @xmath94 , 5)chemical potential at critical temperature @xmath95 , 6)critical temperature @xmath96 . in fig.1 we give the map of a single hole mean occupation number @xmath97 at @xmath98 and zero temperature .",
    "it is well known that in the long wave - length limit heisenberg model is equivalent to the nonlinear @xmath12-model ( e.g. , see review paper@xcite ) .",
    "therefore usual field theory crossing symmetry is valid .",
    "the same is valid for @xmath0 model .",
    "technically it is evident from eq.([hsw ] ) : at @xmath99 the vertex @xmath100 .",
    "this means that instead of considering a set of green s functions @xmath101 , @xmath102 ... , one can introduce one combined green s function of vector excitation @xmath103 where @xmath104 is mobile holes polarization operator . for stability of the system the condition @xmath105 should be fulfilled .",
    "otherwise the green s function ( [ gf ] ) would possess poles with imaginary @xmath106 .",
    "it was demonstrated in the papers@xcite ) that with @xmath107 calculated in the normal hole fermi liquid approximation the condition ( [ stab ] ) is violated .",
    "it means the instability of long - range af order .",
    "now we want to : 1)take into account strong hole - hole pairing , 2)formulate the approach for description of state without long - range af order . in the present section",
    "we discuss only point 2 ) .",
    "for elucidation of physical meaning of our approach it is convenient to use hamiltonian technique instead of the feynman one . due to the interaction with mobile holes the wave function of the renormalized spin - wave corresponding to the green s function ( [ gf ] )",
    "is a combination of @xmath108 and @xmath109 . to find this wave function",
    "let us write down the effective spin - wave hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath110 the term proportional to @xmath111 comes from the `` bare '' hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) .",
    "first `` @xmath112-term '' comes from the diagram fig.3a where one spin - wave is annihilated and the other is created .",
    "second `` @xmath112-term '' comes from diagrams fig.3bc where two spin - waves are annihilated or created .",
    "let us note that spin - waves have definite values of @xmath113 : @xmath108 has @xmath114 and @xmath109 has @xmath115",
    ". therefore they can appear only in combinations presented in ( [ sw ] ) .",
    "one can certainly prove this explicitly using ( [ hsw ] ) and calculating the polarization operator .",
    "in the second `` @xmath112-term '' the spin - waves have the opposite momenta . at @xmath99",
    "the vertex @xmath116 is proportional to the momentum @xmath64 .",
    "just for this reason second `` @xmath112-term '' has different sign in comparison with first one .",
    "diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( [ sw ] ) by the bogoliubov transformation gives the spectrum of bose excitations in the system @xmath117 this is exactly the equation for the poles of the green s function ( [ gf ] ) .",
    "so the hamiltonian approach reproduces conventional result of the feynman technique .",
    "account of @xmath106-dependence of the polarization operator in hamiltonian technique is rather cumbersome .",
    "therefore in the present section we neglect it : @xmath118 . as usual",
    "bogoliubov transformation gives the ground state of the form @xmath119 with some coefficients @xmath120 .",
    "this is the condensate of spin - waves .",
    "we started from neel ground state @xmath18 with two sublattices @xmath121-up and @xmath122-down .",
    "the difference in magnetization of the two sublattices is of the form ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) @xmath123 using parameters of transformation which diagonalizes the hamiltonian ( [ sw ] ) one can easily calculate the renormalized magnetization @xmath124 where @xmath125 .    in the above discussion we assumed that condition ( [ stab ] )",
    "is fulfilled and hence @xmath126 is real .",
    "let us now increase polarization operator ( @xmath127 , @xmath128 ) approaching @xmath126 to zero .",
    "there are two possibilities : 1 ) @xmath126 vanishes at some values of @xmath24 , but @xmath129 remains finite positive because of the convergence of the integral in ( [ magn ] ) .",
    "2 ) in approaching @xmath126 to zero @xmath129 vanishes and then becomes negative .",
    "the choice between these two scenario depends on @xmath24-dependence of @xmath107 .",
    "we will demonstrate below that for paired hole fermi liquid at @xmath130 second scenario is realized .",
    "therefore let us discuss this situation .",
    "vanishing of the magnetization @xmath129 means that there is a lot of spin - waves in the condensate ( [ gs ] ) and we have to take into account their nonlinear interaction",
    ". we can not do it exactly .",
    "fortunately , there is approximate way .",
    "we can apply the modified spin - wave theory suggested by takahashi for the heisenberg model at nonzero temperature@xcite . following takahashi",
    "let us impose the condition that the sublattice magnetization vanishes in the quantum spin - liquid state @xmath131 to find the ground state with this condition we have to diagonalize @xmath132 where @xmath133 is lagrange multiplier , @xmath134 is given by ( [ sw ] ) and @xmath135 by ( [ sz ] ) .",
    "simple calculation shows that instead of ( [ om ] ) we get a spectrum of excitations with a gap @xmath136 the average value of the magnetization is given by the formula ( [ magn ] ) with @xmath137 replaced by @xmath138 . the gap @xmath139 should be found after substitution of this formula into condition ( [ s0 ] ) .",
    "let us stress that this condition reflects strong nonlinearity of the spin - wave theory .",
    "in essence it gives an effective cutoff of unphysical states in the dyson - maleev approach .",
    "this question is discussed in the paper@xcite where the modified spin - wave theory is applied to the description of the transition from af state to spin - liquid state in @xmath140 model .    in the conclusion of present section",
    "we would like to note that realization of the first scenario ( finite positive magnetization @xmath129 at vanishing of @xmath126 at some values of @xmath24 ) would mean instability with respect to decay to spiral state .",
    "it happens at @xmath141 .",
    "we are interested in hole concentration @xmath142 . corresponding value of @xmath64 is @xmath143 . therefore , for practical calculations @xmath12-model long - wave - length approximation ( [ gf ] ) is not enough .",
    "the technique which overcomes this problem was developed by igarashi and fulde@xcite , see also the paper by khaliullin and horsch@xcite .",
    "following these works let us introduce the green s functions for spin - waves @xmath144\\rangle , \\\\ d_{\\alpha \\beta}(t,{\\bf q})&= & -i\\langle t[\\alpha_{\\bf q}(t)\\beta_{\\bf -q}(0)]\\rangle , \\nonumber \\\\ d_{\\beta \\alpha}(t,{\\bf q})&= & -i\\langle t[\\beta_{\\bf -q}^{\\dag}(t)\\alpha_{\\bf q}^{\\dag}(0)]\\rangle , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "d_{\\beta \\beta}(t,{\\bf q})&= & -i\\langle t[\\beta_{\\bf -q}^{\\dag}(t)\\beta_{\\bf -q}(0)]\\rangle , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath145 is the time - ordering operator , and @xmath146 represents an average over the exact ground state . in zero approximation in the interaction with mobile holes the spin - wave",
    "green s functions in @xmath106-@xmath24 representation are given by@xcite @xmath147 polarization operator in this technique is also a matrix .",
    "so there are @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 components .    in one loop approximation polarization operator",
    "is given by the diagrams presented in fig.4 . where the normal as well as the anomalous hole green s function is taken into account .",
    "first of all let us discuss contributions of the `` coherent '' and `` incoherent '' parts of the hole green s function into the polarization operator .",
    "the diagrams in fig.4 are represented in terms of the dressed quasiholes @xmath152 which involve in the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) .",
    "however one can ask the question : what is the accuracy of this approximation and what happens if we substitute the green s function of bare hole @xmath153 into polarization operator ?",
    "the green s function of bare hole is of the form @xmath154 where @xmath155 is quasiparticle residue .",
    "if we use bare hole green s function we also have to use bare hole - spin - wave coupling constant @xmath156 in the vertex @xmath116 ( [ hsw ] ) .",
    "substitution of the pole ( coherent ) part of ( [ hgf ] ) into polarization operator gives combination @xmath157 , but this is exactly the effective coupling constant @xmath57@xcite .",
    "thus , the effective theory with hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) is equivalent to the account of the coherent ( pole ) part of the bare hole green s function ( [ hgf ] ) . according to condition ( [ stab ] )",
    "the most important characteristic is the polarization operator at zero frequency .",
    "if we neglect the pairing of quasiholes we can easily calculate its value in normal fermi - liquid approximation@xcite ) @xmath158 this is coherent contribution .",
    "it is independent of the hole concentration !",
    "incoherent part of the polarization operator which comes from @xmath159 in ( [ hgf])is proportional to hole concentration @xmath160 .",
    "therefore it is negligible at @xmath78 .",
    "this conclusion agrees with that of the ref.@xcite .",
    "it is interesting that incoherent contribution can be also calculated analytically@xcite @xmath161 at any reasonable @xmath160 the incoherent part @xmath162 does not exceed 10% of @xmath163",
    ". therefore further we neglect @xmath164 and use effective theory with the hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) which is equivalent to the account of only coherent part in the hole green s function ( [ hgf ] ) .    due to the symmetry of green s function",
    "it is convenient to introduce following notations @xmath165 calculation of the polarization operator fig.4 in single loop approximation is straightforward .",
    "account of both normal and anomalous hole green s functions gives @xmath166,\\nonumber\\\\ { \\overline \\pi}^{(1)}(\\omega,{\\bf q})= & & \\sum_{\\bf k } \\biggl(v_{\\bf k}^2 u_{\\bf k+q}^2 g_{\\bf k , q}g_{\\bf k+q ,-",

    "let us consider now two and more loop corrections to polarization operator .",
    "some diagrams of this type with normal hole green s function are presented in fig.5 .",
    "one can easily prove that the diagram fig.5a ( single spin - wave exchange ) vanishes due to the spin - flip nature of the hole - spin - wave vertex .",
    "vanishing of this diagram is absolutely similar to the vanishing of the single loop correction to the hole - spin - wave vertex ( see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the diagram fig.5b equals to zero for the same reason . to calculate the diagram fig.5c let us represent it using goldstone diagram technique : fig.6 . in the intermediate state in the diagram",
    "fig.6a as well as in the diagram fig.6b there is two - particles two - holes excitation@xcite .",
    "nevertheless these two diagrams are essentially different .",
    "all intermediate momenta in the diagram fig.6b are in the vicinity of fermi surface ( @xmath169 ) , and therefore this diagram is convergent . on other hand",
    "the particles momenta in diagram fig.6a are not restricted and this diagram is ultraviolet divergent .",
    "the divergence gives logarithmic enhancement of this diagram .",
    "further we neglect contribution fig.6b , and transform fig.6a into an effective diagram fig.7 with `` dot '' given by fig.8 .",
    "we are interested in relatively small @xmath64 ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "therefore all momenta in the diagram fig.7 are close to the fermi surface .",
    "it means that we need to calculate the effective interaction ( `` dot '' ) at fig.8 at @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "let us neglect q - dependence ( set @xmath173 ) and denote this effective interaction by @xmath174 .",
    "single particle state near @xmath175 is related to that near @xmath176 via umklapp process and therefore these points are actually equivalent .",
    "it is like one pocket of the fermi surface . due to this reason @xmath177 .",
    "certainly one can prove this relation explicitly using perturbation theory expression corresponding to diagram fig.8 .",
    "so there are only two independent pockets of the fermi surface ( for example centred near @xmath178 and @xmath179 ) , and the effective interaction can be characterized by the two values only : @xmath180 first one is the effective particle - hole interaction when particle and hole are from the same pocket .",
    "second value is particle - hole interaction when particle and hole are from different pockets .    using hole - spin - wave interaction ( [ hsw ] )",
    "one can easily derive expression for @xmath181 corresponding to diagram fig.8 @xmath182 here @xmath183 . at @xmath184",
    "the integral in ( [ dot ] ) is logarithmic divergent ( @xmath185 ) and therefore @xmath181 can be analytically calculated with logarithmic accuracy @xmath186 the big logarithm @xmath187 equals to @xmath188 where @xmath189 is typical value of superconducting gap and @xmath190 is ultraviolet cutoff which is of the order of hole band width .",
    "actually only this logarithm justifies introduction of the effective point - like interaction @xmath191 . certainly expression ( [ dot ] )",
    "can be easily exactly evaluated numerically .",
    "similar consideration shows that due to the structure of hole - spin - wave vertex ( [ hsw ] ) effective particle hole interaction for particle and hole from different pockets vanishes @xmath192    above discussion is not the end of the story about effective particle - hole interaction in the spin - flip channel .",
    "it was just a leading order . to find correct value we have to sum all the `` ladder '' given at fig.9 .",
    "fortunately each additional rung in ladder gives additional big logarithm and therefore summation can be easily done with logarithmic accuracy @xmath193 summation of the ladder does not change the relation ( [ dot+- ] ) : effective particle hole interaction for particle and hole from different pockets vanishes .",
    "for very small hole concentration @xmath160 the superconducting gap @xmath189 is approaching zero , @xmath194 , and hence @xmath195 in practice @xmath187 is never big enough to reach this limit",
    ". realistic value of @xmath187 can be found by comparing ( [ dotan ] ) with the result of exact numerical calculation of ( [ dot ] ) . at @xmath196 @xmath197 , and it drops down to @xmath198 at at @xmath199 . substituting correct value of @xmath187 into ( [ ladder ] )",
    "we find renormalized particle - hole interaction in spin - flip channel @xmath200 .",
    "numerical values of @xmath200 are presented in the table.ii .",
    "actually it is almost constant @xmath201 for interesting concentrations .",
    "now we can calculate exact spin - wave polarization operator chaining effective particle hole interaction in the spin - flip channel , see fig.10 .",
    "this chaining is substantially simplified by the fact that the pockets of the fermi surface are well separated .",
    "let us represent single loop polarization operator ( [ polpi ] ) as a sum of contributions corresponding to different pockets @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the integrand in formula ( [ polpi ] ) .",
    "regions @xmath204 and @xmath205 of magnetic brillouin zone are shown at fig.1 .",
    "we remind that point @xmath175 is connected with @xmath176 via umklapp process and therefore the region @xmath204 represents one pocket .",
    "the same is valid for @xmath205 . due to",
    "the condition ( [ dot+- ] ) particle - hole scattering does not transfer particle - hole excitation from one pocket to another , but inside pocket scattering amplitude ( [ ladder ] ) is constant . in this situation summation of chain in fig.10 is trivial .",
    "the exact spin - wave polarization operator ( [ pol ] ) is of the form @xmath206 where @xmath207    unfortunately further analytical calculation of @xmath104 and @xmath208 given by ( [ polex ] ) is impossible .",
    "however numerical calculation using ( [ polpi ] ) , ( [ polpok]),([q ] ) and parameters of superconducting wave function found in the section ii is straightforward",
    ". we will discuss it in detail in the next section .",
    "let us look here only at the limit @xmath209 .",
    "in this limit @xmath210 this reflects the fact that we can forget about all complications connected with multi component spin - wave green s function ( [ gfs ] ) , and use simple @xmath12-model picture ( [ gf ] ) .",
    "let us introduce parameter of spin - wave instability @xmath211 according to equation ( [ stab ] ) if @xmath212 spectrum of excitations is unstable .",
    "naive value of @xmath213 corresponding to normal fermi liquid approximation ( [ p0q ] ) is @xmath214 numerical values of @xmath213 obtained with ( [ polex ] ) for different hole concentrations are presented in the table ii .",
    "we see that pairing and particle - hole rescattering ( [ ladder ] ) substantially reduce value of @xmath213 .",
    "actually rescattering is more important , but it has the same origin as the pairing .",
    "nevertheless @xmath215 , and long - range antiferromagnetic order is unstable .",
    "to deal with spin - wave instability let us apply approach developed in the section iii . with takahashi condition ( [ s0]),([sz ] ) bare spin - wave hamiltonian is transformed to @xmath216.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] lagrange multiplier @xmath139 will be found later from the condition ( [ s0 ] ) .",
    "dioganalization of the hamiltonian ( [ hnu1 ] ) by usual bogoliubov transformation gives new bare spin - wave spectrum @xmath217 and new bare spin - wave operators @xmath218 , @xmath219 @xmath220 we will see below that @xmath139 is very small .",
    "therefore we neglect @xmath221 in comparison with @xmath222 . hole - spin - wave interaction ( [ hsw ] ) should be also expressed in terms of @xmath223 and @xmath224 operators @xmath225 let us note that due to the goldstone theorem @xmath226 at @xmath227 . however , in the state which we discuss now rotational symmetry is restored and therefore @xmath228 .    similar to ( [ gfs ] ) we introduce green s functions @xmath229 , @xmath230 , @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",
    "zero approximation green s functions @xmath233 ... are given by eqs .",
    "( [ gfs0 ] ) with replacement @xmath234 .",
    "polarization operators are given by the formulas of the previous section with replacement @xmath235 .",
    "spin - wave green s functions obey usual dyson equations@xcite ) @xmath236 solution of these equations together with ( [ pol ] ) gives @xmath237 in these formulas we omit for simplicity argument @xmath24 in the polarization operator .",
    "we do not specify imaginary part of @xmath238 in the poles because below we perform wick s rotation @xmath239 which automatically gives correct behaviour . using ( [ sz ] ) one can easily express average magnetization in the terms of green s functions ( [ dren ] ) @xmath240 where @xmath138 is given by the expression @xmath241\\biggr).\\ ] ] we have to find the lagrange multiplier @xmath139 from equation ( [ m1 ] ) . at small @xmath24 , due to the relation ( [ q=0 ] ) , the expression in square brackets in ( [ m2 ] ) vanishes and @xmath242 . if one neglects also @xmath243-dependence of polarization operator , the integration over @xmath243 in ( [ m2 ] ) is trivial and it is reduced to formula ( [ gap ] ) derived in section iii in @xmath12-model approximation .",
    "now we can proceed to the discussion of the results of numerical calculations .",
    "dependence of hole - hole pairing on the modification of spin - wave spectrum is rather weak at @xmath78 , and we neglect it ( see also end of these section ) .",
    "therefore , we use parameters of hole bcs wave function found in section ii . calculation of the polarization operator is described in detail in section iv .",
    "one should not forget about the replacement @xmath235 , but numerically it is not very important .",
    "the values of @xmath139 found from equation ( [ m1 ] ) are presented in the table ii .",
    "the effective spin - wave frequency @xmath138 depends both on direction and magnitude of @xmath24 .",
    "it is convenient to take the bare spin - wave frequency @xmath111 as an argument instead of @xmath244 .",
    "the plots of @xmath138 as a function of @xmath111 for the directions @xmath245 and @xmath246 and for different hole concentrations are given in figs.11a - d .",
    "at very small hole concentration @xmath160 , equation ( [ m1 ] ) has no solution .",
    "one can easily understand the reason for this .",
    "the parameter of spin - wave instability @xmath213 is larger then 1 at arbitrary small hole concentration @xmath160 , see eqs.([zakr]),([naive ] ) and table ii .",
    "it means that dependence of @xmath138 on @xmath244 should be of the type of solid line at fig.11a with minimum at @xmath247 .",
    "let us denote the value of @xmath138 at this point by @xmath248 .",
    "this minimum value is directly related to @xmath139 . therefore instead of @xmath139 we can consider @xmath248 as a variable which should be found from eq.([m1 ] ) .",
    "if frequency @xmath138 is isotropic @xmath249 the equation ( [ m1 ] ) has obvious solution at arbitrary small @xmath160 @xmath250 the problem is that the polarization operator and hence @xmath251 is not isotropic .",
    "it is seen explicitly from fig .",
    "the anisotropy is proportional to some power of @xmath252 .",
    "therefore at small enough concentration the anisotropy is larger than exponentially small @xmath248 and equation ( [ m1 ] ) has no solution .",
    "thus if we start from spin - liquid phase ( say from @xmath98 ) and decrease hole density @xmath160 , at some critical value @xmath253 the gap @xmath248 vanishes .",
    "it means instability of spin liquid state with respect to decay to spin waves with momentum @xmath254 ( spirals ) . the critical value @xmath255 .",
    "due to the strong exponential dependence of ( [ om0 ] ) on @xmath160 it is hard to find numerically the exact value of @xmath256 .",
    "we would like to note that the dip in fig.11a is a result of virtual admixture of spirals to the spin - liquid ground state .",
    "one can consider @xmath139 as a gap @xmath2 in the spin - wave spectrum at @xmath173 . at small hole concentration ( @xmath257 ) minimum of the effective spectrum",
    "is shifted from the point @xmath173 , see figs.11ab .",
    "one has to be careful with interpretation of @xmath2 .",
    "the effective frequency @xmath251 defined by eq.([m2 ] ) is not a frequency of simple excitation in the sense that green s function @xmath258 .",
    "green s function is of essentially more complicated form .",
    "it has poles and cuts .",
    "therefore , using standard terminology , it is better to say that @xmath2 is pseudo - gap and that @xmath138 is pseudo - spectrum .",
    "the calculated value of pseudo - gap as well as its dependence on the hole concentration reasonably agrees with experimental data@xcite .    in equation ( [ m1 ] )",
    "we have overcome the problem of real spectrum by integrating over imaginary @xmath106 . for real @xmath106 structure of the spectrum",
    "is as follow . at very small @xmath259",
    "there is a damped spin - wave with frequency @xmath260 .",
    "the decay of the spin - wave into particle - hole pair is allowed due to the nodes of the superconducting gap .",
    "with increasing of @xmath64 , spectrum is split into the two branches : 1)damped spin - wave with frequency @xmath261 , and 2)low frequency collective excitation consisting mainly of the particles and holes .",
    "starting from some value of @xmath64 decay of this excitation into particle and hole is forbidden due to the superconducting gap . therefore in this low frequency region spin - wave",
    "green s function can be represented as @xmath262 where @xmath155 is the spin - wave residue .",
    "the frequency of collective excitation @xmath263 as a function of @xmath111 for direction @xmath264 and for hole concentration @xmath98 is plotted at fig.11b . due to the decay to real particle - hole pair",
    "this spectrum has no meaning at very small @xmath64 and at large @xmath64 .",
    "spin - wave residue @xmath155 changes along the drawn curve from @xmath265 at left hand side of curve to @xmath266 at right hand side of the interval .",
    "detail analysis of the spectrum of spin @xmath1 excitations is an important problem .",
    "it requires calculation of the dynamic magnetic formfactor @xmath267 of the system . having this formfactor one can perform accurate comparison with an experimental data on neutron scattering and nmr .",
    "it is a subject of a separate work .",
    "here we concentrate on the magnetic correlation length @xmath3 and static magnetic formfactor @xmath268 .",
    "this is the place to remind the reader that in the calculation of the superconducting pairing we have used unperturbed spin - wave spectrum .",
    "this approximation is justified by the parameter @xmath269 ( see refs.@xcite and eq.([omega ] ) ) .",
    "however for most interesting concentrations ( @xmath270 ) this parameter is not so good .",
    "we see from fig.11a that for @xmath196 the effective spin - wave spectrum is actually close to the unperturbed one .",
    "however for @xmath199 ( fig.11d ) deviation is rather big .",
    "therefore to complete our program we have to solve eliashberg equations for pairing with renormalized spin - wave green s function ( compare with ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this should be a subject of a separate work .",
    "however qualitatively the influence of this effect is evident .",
    "effective pairing interaction ( [ vkk ] ) is roughly proportional to the inverse spin - wave frequency .",
    "therefore , the renormalized interaction gives stronger pairing than that in `` zero approximation '' .",
    "due to our preliminary estimations , the correction to pairing is about 30% at @xmath271 .",
    "we remind the reader that the spin wave operators @xmath272 and @xmath273 are introduced using dyson - maleev transformation@xcite for localized spin @xmath274 , @xmath275 the operators @xmath272 and @xmath273 are related to @xmath276 and @xmath277 by usual combination of fourier and bogoliubov transformations , see e.g. refs.@xcite . following takahashi@xcite",
    "we introduce notations @xmath278 where brackets @xmath146 represents an average over ground state . using mean field procedure for",
    "the averaging of the quartic terms ( @xmath279 ) one can express spin - spin correlators in terms of functions @xmath57 and @xmath280 ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "@xmath281    using definition ( [ fg ] ) , the functions @xmath57 and @xmath280 can be expressed in terms of green s functions @xmath282 , @xmath283 ... this is quite similar to the average magnetization ( [ m1 ] ) .",
    "then with the help of formulas ( [ dren ] ) one gets @xmath284 the effective frequency @xmath138 is given by equation ( [ m2 ] ) .",
    "the `` prime '' effective frequency is defined by slightly different formula @xmath285 + 2{\\overline \\pi}(i\\xi,{\\bf q})\\biggr).\\ ] ] for small momentum @xmath286 .",
    "therefore @xmath287 for @xmath99 .",
    "according to computations the relation @xmath288 is valid with reasonable accuracy for arbitrary @xmath64 .",
    "let us note that due to the spin - liquid equation ( [ m1 ] ) @xmath289 .",
    "together with ( [ ss ] ) this gives correct value of spin : @xmath290 .",
    "the results of numerical calculation of the functions @xmath57 and @xmath280 are given in fig.12 .",
    "distance between sites attains the values @xmath291 .",
    "we plot @xmath292 for odd value of @xmath293 , and @xmath294 for even value of @xmath293 .",
    "one can see that for @xmath295 the dependence is practically linear .",
    "hence @xmath296 the values of the magnetic correlation length @xmath3 found from fig.12 are given in the table ii .",
    "using eqs.([ss ] ) and ( [ fgexp ] ) one can express static magnetic formfactor in terms of the effective frequencies @xmath297 and @xmath298 @xmath299 for @xmath300 the integrand in ( [ ffact ] ) vanishes at small @xmath23 because @xmath301 at @xmath302 . therefore only large momenta contribute into @xmath303 .",
    "for @xmath304 situation is different because @xmath305 and @xmath306 .",
    "therefore contribution of small @xmath307 into @xmath308 is stressed like one over spin - wave pseudo - gap squared ( @xmath309 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath303 and @xmath308 for different hole concentrations are given in the table ii .",
    "the static formfactor @xmath268 at hole concentration @xmath310 is plotted at fig.13 .",
    "we have to note that due to the strong dependence on the pseudo - gap which is nearly zero at @xmath196 , the value of @xmath308 at this concentration is sensitive to small variation of parameters .",
    "therefore the accuracy of calculation of @xmath308 at this point is very poor .",
    "this is reflection of the closeness to the critical concentration @xmath256 at which system drops down into the irregular spin - glass state ( see discussion in the previous section ) .",
    "although we do not observe the shift of the @xmath268 maximum from the point @xmath311 our result agrees qualitatively with that of finite cluster numerical simulation@xcite ( see also review paper@xcite and references therein , where results for other models are presented ) .",
    "however the values of @xmath308 obtained by us are substantially higher than those from finite cluster simulations .",
    "we have mentioned already that @xmath308 is very sensitive to the spin - wave pseudo - gap at small momenta .",
    "therefore the possible reason of disagreement is that with relatively small claster it is impossible to reproduce correct spin - wave spectrum at small momenta .",
    "in the present work using the picture of spin - wave condensation we have derived explicitly spin liquid ground state of the doped two - dimensional @xmath0 model . translation invariant spin - liquid solution exists at doping @xmath312 .",
    "we have demonstrated that spin - wave condensation and condensation of cooper pairs ( superconducting pairing of mobile holes ) are intrinsically connected .",
    "the developed approach allows to calculate any property of the ground state as well as spectrum of excitations . in the present work we have calculated spin - wave pseudo - gap @xmath2 ( table ii ) , effective spectrum ( or pseudo - spectrum ) of @xmath1 excitations ( fig.11 ) , magnetic correlation length @xmath3 and static magnetic formfactor @xmath4 ( table ii and fig .",
