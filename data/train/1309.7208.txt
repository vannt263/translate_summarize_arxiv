    "the focus of this paper is the cauchy problem for the 2d advection - diffusion equation ( ade ) , a.k.a . passive scalar equation , which in the ` small - diffusion ' formulation reads @xmath0 the unknown @xmath1 is a scalar function of spatial coordinates @xmath2 and time @xmath3 , while @xmath4 is a given time - independent or time - periodic vector - field ( flow ) , and @xmath5 is a given diffusivity . we restrict our attention to divergence - free flows only , i.e. , the flows which satisfy @xmath6 .",
    "more specifically , we assume the existence of a time - independent or time - periodic stream - function ( hamiltonian ) , @xmath7 , such that @xmath8 , with @xmath9 denoting the two - dimensional curl .",
    "the equation constitutes an important paradigm for a wide range of physical , chemical , and biological processes that are characterized both by transport induced by a fluid flow as well as diffusive forces of different nature .",
    "examples include homogenization in fluid mixtures , pollutant dispersion in the ocean or atmosphere , temporal evolution of biological systems in flowing media , energy transport in flowing media , etc .",
    "thus , it is at all not surprising that understanding of the advective dynamics of passive scalars in the presence of diffusion has been a subject of intensive research reaching back to at least as far as batchelor @xcite .",
    "a significant amount of physical and mathematical literature has been devoted to the study of the ade in various settings : on unbounded domains , compact manifolds , or bounded domains in conjunction with certain boundary conditions .",
    "the diffusion is responsible for a rather simple long - time dynamics characterized by the relaxation toward an equilibrium @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 in the case of dirichlet boundary conditions , or @xmath13 in the case of von neumann or periodic boundary conditions , for example . )",
    "a large open area of study remains the rather intricate interplay between diffusion and advection in the semi - classical limit @xmath14 .",
    "the convection - driven enhancement of dissipation ( relaxation , mixing ) is of particular interest .",
    "depending on the boundary problem , and closely related to it , on the structure of the spectrum of the non - self - adjoint advection - diffusion operator @xmath15 , various methods ( e.g. homogenization , probabilistic , variational and ` pde ' methods ) have been employed . here , we review some of the relevant existing literature .    on unbounded domains and periodic media , some of these questions have been addressed within the framework of the homogenization theory @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the long - time , long - distance behavior of solutions is governed by an effective - diffusion equation , @xmath16 , where the constant matrix @xmath17 is the so - called effective diffusivity tensor . the effective diffusion in a given direction @xmath18 is then given by @xmath19 , and convection - enhanced scaling regimes as ` good ' as @xmath20 and as ` bad ' as @xmath21 have been identified .",
    "in particular , the typical scaling regime @xmath22 has been observed and referred to as convection - enhanced diffusion ( see @xcite ) .",
    "homogenization theory does not , however , provide satisfactory explanation of the short - term enhancement of dissipation by convection .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , zlato defined dissipation enhancing flows @xmath23 on an unbounded domain @xmath24 by requiring that for any initial condition @xmath25 , the solution @xmath26 of the cauchy problem ( [ eq : initial_ad_eqn ] ) satisfy @xmath27 loosely speaking , zlato then characterized these flows by the condition that the only eigenfunctions of the advection operator @xmath28 are the first integrals of @xmath23 .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we are primarily interested in the case of a bounded domain @xmath24 with dirichlet ( or von neumann ) boundary conditions . under some mild regularity conditions on @xmath23 , the time - independent advection - diffusion operator possesses a pure point spectrum consisting of isolated eigenvalues that have positive ( nonnegative ) real part @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalue with the least positive real part is referred to as the principal eigenvalue , @xmath29 .",
    "this value determines the slowest time scale of relaxation toward the equilibrium in the sense that , for generic initial data @xmath30 ( i.e. , the initial data with a non - vanishing projection onto the eigenspace corresponding to the principal eigenvalue ) , the following holds : @xmath31 therefore , the dependence of @xmath29 on @xmath21 essentially determines any convection - enhanced dissipation ( relaxation , mixing ) rate for generic initial conditions .",
    "berestycki et al .",
    "@xcite identified a sharp criterion for the principal eigenvalue @xmath29 to scale linearly with @xmath21 as @xmath14 ( no dissipation enhancement ) .",
    "more precisely , the authors proved that @xmath32 is bounded as @xmath14 if and only if @xmath23 has a first integral @xmath33 in the space @xmath34 , i.e. , if @xmath35 .",
    "when this is not the case , the authors proved that we find ourselves in the dissipation enhanced regime in the sense that for any initial datum @xmath30 , ( [ diss_enhance ] ) holds .    while the principal eigenvalue is the most relevant quantity , the complete picture of the relaxation dynamics",
    "is given by the structure of the entire spectrum , potentially a very complicated set since the advection - diffusion operator @xmath36 is a sum of a self - adjoint operator , @xmath37 , and an anti - self - adjoint operator , @xmath28 , and as such , possesses neither symmetry .",
    "the theory of non - self - adjoint ( nsa ) operators lags far behind the theory of self - adjoint ( sa ) operators ( see @xcite ) .",
    "self - adjoint theory has at its disposal a powerful tool in the spectral theorem , as well as a variety of variational methods , that can be used to obtain tight bounds on eigenvalues both theoretically and numerically .",
    "the self - adjoint theory and its techniques have been used to great effect in quantum mechanics .",
    "the non - self - adjoint theory , on the other hand , is much less cohesive and still remarkably incomplete .",
    "it comprises a wide variety of diverse methods whose only commonality is the use , in one way or another , of ideas from analytic function theory .",
    "the complicated structure of the spectrum for ade has been observed numerically by giona et al .",
    "( see @xcite ) where the most important feature is the occurrence of different eigenvalue branches with possibly different convection - enhanced scaling regimes .",
    "in particular , for the parallel sine flow @xmath38 on the unit torus , a ` diffusive ' branch of eigenvalues which scale linearly with @xmath21 is found to coexist with two ( equivalent ) ` convective ' branches of eigenvalues which scale as @xmath22  the same scaling also observed by homogenization techniques ( see @xcite ) and referred to as convection - enhanced diffusion .",
    "giona et al .",
    "provide a heuristic argument for the presence of the convection - enhanced branch based on the numerically observed localization of the eigenfunctions .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a rigorous mathematical justification .    in accordance with our discussion above about nsa operators ,",
    "general results are extremely difficult to obtain .",
    "we focus on the case of liouville integrable hamiltonians",
    "@xmath39 that allow for canonical transformation to action - angle coordinates @xmath40 , and consider domains @xmath24 topologically equivalent to either a disk or an annulus whose boundary consists of level sets of @xmath39 . in this case",
    ", @xmath41 possesses a first integral in @xmath34 and hence the principal eigenvalue scales linearly with @xmath21 .",
    "the advantage of action - angle coordinate formulation is that the advection assumes a very simple form @xmath42 and , under mild conditions on @xmath43 , solutions converge to solutions of the equation obtained by averaging the coefficients of the diffusion operator written in action - angle coordinates with respect to the angle coordinate @xmath44 .",
    "the underlying eigenvalue equation allows for separation of action and angle coordinates through the ansatz @xmath45 , leading to a countable family of 1d equations in @xmath46 involving an imaginary potential @xmath47 ( @xmath48 is the imaginary unit and @xmath49 is an integer ) .",
    "for @xmath50 , the equation is a self - adjoint problem leading to eigenvalues which scale linearly with @xmath21 . when @xmath51 , however , it is a non - self - adjoint convection - dominated problem which is much more difficult and leads to nonlinear scaling with respect to @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , the solutions for any initial data @xmath52 with zero - mean in the angle coordinate @xmath44 , i.e. , when @xmath53 , are subject to the dissipation enhanced regime in the sense of ( [ diss_enhance ] ) . fixing @xmath54 , the equation can be thought of as the 1d analogue of the advection - diffusion equation which retains exact features of the ade not based on approximations .",
    "this equation also involves a non - self - adjoint operator whose spectral structure is difficult to characterize in general .",
    "an important example is the case of unidirectional axisymmetric radial flows in annular regions or disks , which include physically realizable flows such as the couette flow and poiseuille flow .",
    "we are able to apply the wkbj method on the complex plane , as developed in @xcite .",
    "the complexity of the spectrum depends on the behavior of the potential near the boundary and its critical points .",
    "following @xcite , we consider the case when @xmath55 is either monotone or concave , which includes the cases of ( regularized ) vortical flow , the couette flow and the poiseuille flow .",
    "we show that in the semi - classical limit @xmath56 , the spectrum converges to a collection of lines related to the so - called stokes graphs .",
    "we also infer information about the scaling of eigenvalues on those lines with respect to @xmath21 , which is typically either @xmath22 ( for quadratic critical points ) or @xmath57 ( for non - critical boundary points ) .",
    "note that the case of mhd driven annular micromixers leading to the poiseuille profile was examined in @xcite . using a particular ansatz",
    ", the authors identified one spectral branch with the scaling @xmath57 .",
    "as we shall see , scaling regimes @xmath57 and @xmath22 coexist for this particular case .",
    "in addition to treating the autonomous case , we also treat the time - periodic case , assuming , however , that the time dependence of the stream function @xmath58 is completely separable so that @xmath59 the case where @xmath60 is a mean - free periodic function of time with period @xmath61 , @xmath62 was treated in @xcite .",
    "lie - transformation based averaging techniques were used to show that the solutions converge to solutions of a autonomous self - adjoint diffusive equation . in this paper",
    ", we treat the case of non - vanishing mean @xmath63 .",
    "we use the averaging principle for perturbations of hamiltonian systems ( see @xcite ) to show that the solutions converge to solutions of an autonomous advection - diffusion equation , so that the relaxation dynamics in this particular non - autonomous case are , up to a small diffusive correction , the same as those of the autonomous diffusion equation .",
    "let us first consider the autonomous advection - diffusion equation ( [ eq : initial_ad_eqn ] ) with @xmath64 for some time - independent hamiltonian @xmath39 . throughout the paper , we assume that the level sets @xmath65 are compact , closed and connected curves , so that the conditions of the liouville s theorem on integrable systems are satisfied .",
    "it is well known ( see @xcite ) that the system then allows for a canonical transformation to action - angle variables @xmath66 which satisfy the following two conditions : ( a ) the hamiltonian is a function of the action coordinate , @xmath67 and ( b ) @xmath68 .",
    "let us first assume that @xmath24 is topologically equivalent to an annulus bounded by curves @xmath69 and @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "we consider the dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath72 ( or the von neuman boundary conditions @xmath73 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath23 possesses a first integral belonging to @xmath34 , and therefore it is not dissipation enhancing in the sense of ( [ diss_enhance ] ) .",
    "introducing @xmath74 , the original advection - diffusion equation ( [ eq : initial_ad_eqn ] ) in action - angle coordinates can be written as @xmath75 expressing the new coefficients for the laplacian in terms of action - angle coordinates , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we write the equation as @xmath80 here @xmath81 note that the coefficient functions @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are periodic in the angle coordinate @xmath86 with period @xmath87 .",
    "we introduce the following notation for the averages @xmath88 and @xmath89 note that @xmath90 .",
    "we now write the averaged equation , @xmath91 if @xmath92 has a finite number of zeros , then the solutions of ( [ eq : ad_in_aa_coordinates ] ) converge to the solutions of ( [ eq : ad_av_in_aa_coordinates ] ) in the limit @xmath14 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we are interested in the underlying eigenvalue problem @xmath93 this equation has the advantage that we can seek the eigenfunctions through the ansatz @xmath94 where @xmath49 and @xmath95 are integers and @xmath96 satisfies the eigenvalue problem @xmath97 together with the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath98 ( or von neumann boundary conditions @xmath99 ) . for @xmath50 , this equation reads @xmath100 which is a self - adjoint problem leading to eigenvalues which scale linearly with @xmath21 . when @xmath51 , however , it is a non - self - adjoint convection - dominated problem which is much more difficult to analyze and leads to nonlinear scaling with respect to @xmath21 .",
    "as already discussed in the introduction , the solutions for any initial data @xmath52 with zero - mean in the angle coordinate @xmath44 , i.e. , when @xmath101 , are subject to the dissipation enhanced regime in the sense of ( [ diss_enhance ] ) .",
    "the case when @xmath24 is topologically equivalent to a disk , i.e. , when the boundary @xmath102 for some @xmath103 is treated similarly .",
    "then , there exists @xmath104 ( w.l.o.g . , we assume that @xmath71 ) , so that @xmath69 consists of a point at which @xmath105 is undefined . we then study the problem on a punctured disk @xmath106 .",
    "the difficulty , however , arises from the fact that the coefficients of the diffusion operator in action - angle coordinates possess a singularity at the punctured point , and one has to infer the boundary condition at @xmath104 from the asymptotic behavior of the solution at the punctured point .",
    "let @xmath60 be @xmath61-periodic for some @xmath107 , and let @xmath108 , where @xmath109 this paper is a continuation of authors work @xcite for the mean - free case @xmath110 , and in this section we review some of the results of that paper .",
    "the functon @xmath111 is assumed to be time - periodic with period @xmath107 .",
    "we assume that @xmath112 is periodic and mean - free function of time @xmath3 and @xmath113 is a constant .",
    "there are three dynamically distinct cases : ( 1 ) the autonomous case ( @xmath114 ) ; ( 2 ) the non - autonomous case with vanishing mean ( @xmath115 ) ; and ( 3 ) the non - autonomous case with non - vanishing mean ( @xmath116 and @xmath117 ) .",
    "firstly , we introduce @xmath118 which is also @xmath61-periodic .",
    "again , we transform the equation using action - angle coordinates , @xmath119 similarly as before , the original advection - diffusion equation ( [ eq : initial_ad_eqn ] ) in these coordinates is written as @xmath120 we now use stream - lines @xmath121 and @xmath122 as new coordinates via the transformation @xmath123 with the following transformation rules : @xmath124 this transformation to stream - lines coordinates is nothing but a transformation to a new `` co - moving '' reference frame . denoting by @xmath125 and",
    "@xmath126 the ( time - dependent ) coefficient matrix and vector in these new coordinates , the equation ( [ eq : ad_in_aa_coordinates1 ] ) becomes @xmath127 when @xmath128 , the advective term in equation ( [ eq : ad_in_aa_coordinates1 ] ) disappears , and we obtain an equation for @xmath129 of the form @xmath130 all effects of the influence of the advective field are now contained in the time - dependent coefficients @xmath131 and @xmath126 and , therefore , equation ( [ eq : new_equation_in_streamlines_coords ] ) is now suitable for averaging .",
    "the main idea of the authors paper @xcite was to apply a near - identity lie transform that eliminates the explicit time dependence of the coefficients ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "however , in the case when @xmath132 , we write the averaged equation in an ad - hoc fashion , @xmath133 the justification for convergence to the averaged equation via the lie - transform approach , which was used for the zero - mean case does not apply to this case .",
    "the convergence to the averaged equation on timescales @xmath20 , however , can be justified by the averaging principle , given that the hamiltonian @xmath39 satisfies some mild regularity conditions ( see @xcite , theorem 3.2 ) .      as already mentioned in the introduction , we are particularly interested in a special case that is very instructive both analytically and numerically , the case of unidirectional axisymmetric radial flows in annular regions or disks , which include physically realizable flows such as the couette and poiseuille flows , and the ( regularized ) vortical flow .",

    "the advection - diffusion equation ( [ eq : initial_ad_eqn ] ) then reads in polar coordinates @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the laplace operator in polar coordinates . in the non - autonomus case @xmath116",

    "in the following section , we study the spectral properties of the autonomous non - selfadjoint operator associated with the equation ( [ eq : ad_averaged1 ] ) , i.e. the problem , @xmath151 on a disk @xmath152 or an annulus @xmath153 subject to homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath154 or the von neumann boundary conditions @xmath155 . here",

    "the set @xmath297 consists of three disjoint , connected , closed components , the ` left ' , @xmath298 , the ` right ' , @xmath299 and the ` upper ' , @xmath300 . we need to show that there is a number @xmath293 so that for @xmath296 , the characteristic determinant @xmath301 for the fundamental solutions ( [ fundamental_solutions ] ) does not vanish on @xmath302 . it can be proven ( see @xcite ) that for @xmath303 there exists a canonical domain @xmath225 and a path @xmath304 within @xmath225 which connects the points @xmath305 and @xmath306 .",
    "hence , the following representation holds : @xmath307-e^{-(m\\varepsilon)^{-\\frac12}(s(r^+,\\mu)-s(r^-,\\mu))}[1]\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath308 , which does not vanish in @xmath196 .",
    "therefore , @xmath309 is only possible if @xmath310 a sufficient condition for @xmath311 is therefore @xmath312 with a constant @xmath313 depending only on @xmath294 .",
    "the proof requires a separate discussion depending on the position of @xmath215 with respect to the lines @xmath314 . in the case when @xmath215 is above @xmath315 , we use the fact that @xmath305 and @xmath306 are connected by @xmath304 which intercepts one stokes line only , at which @xmath316 changes sign . therefore , @xmath317 and @xmath318 are of opposite signs .",
    "we use compactness arguments to arrive at the conclusion . for @xmath215 under @xmath315 , @xmath304 can be chosen to be the segment @xmath205 $ ] , and therefore w.l.o.g . ,",

    "note that @xmath311 in this case is equivalent to @xmath324 further details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the last theorem can be strengthened in the sense that the dirichlet eigenvalues of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eigenvalue ] ) can be tracked by points @xmath277 , @xmath278 and @xmath279 , which lie on @xmath291 ( @xmath270 , @xmath271 and @xmath272 , respectively ) , and their scaling with @xmath21 yields the scaling of the eigenvalues .",

    "( [ eq : eigenvalue ] ) lies either in @xmath328 or in a @xmath330 neighborhood of one of the points from those three sets .",
    "each neighborhood contains at most one eigenvalue .",
    "again , we only sketch the proof .",
    "let us focus on the curve @xmath270 .",
    "for the sake of clarity , let us assume that @xmath331 . recall that with each @xmath219 a three - line stokes complex @xmath224 is associated .",
    "these yield three distinct canonical domains , each of which has one of the stokes lines from the complex belonging to it , and the other two on its boundary .",
    "we denote each one by @xmath227 , @xmath228 or @xmath229 , depending which one of the three stokes lines belongs to it .",

    "the two fundamental sets of solutions ( [ fundamental_solutions ] ) are related through the following transmission formula for neighboring canonical domains : @xmath339 & [ 1 ] \\\\                                           1 & 0 \\end{array } \\right ) \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } g^+_{\\rm right}(r,\\mu ) \\\\",

    "therefore , @xmath309 is equivalent ( up to exponentially small terms ) to @xmath351 this equation , in turn , is equivalent to @xmath352 if we neglect the @xmath353 term , the roots near the curve @xmath354 are determined from the equation @xmath355 the conclusion for eigenvalues near @xmath354 follows similarly .",
    "near @xmath356 , the conclusion is simpler and does nt require the transmission formula .",
    "note that the relation ( [ q ] ) for eigenvalues bellow @xmath315 reads @xmath357 if we were allowed to neglect @xmath353 , we would obtain the following formula for the solutions @xmath358 again , the details , and in particular the justification for neglecting @xmath353 can be found in @xcite .    the last two theorems remain valid in the case of the disk .",
    "the proof has to be slightly modified , however , because the approximation ( [ fundamental_solutions ] ) breaks down in the neighborhood of the singularity @xmath164 .",
