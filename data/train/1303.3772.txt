    "identifying thermoelectric materials composed of environmentally friendly and/or plentiful elements is one current thrust of the thermoelectric community .",
    "recent successes in this area include several zintl phases , such as ca@xmath0alsb@xmath0 and ca@xmath10al@xmath11sb@xmath12.@xcite simple binaries such as fesb@xmath11 and fesi may be promising for low - temperature applications.@xcite in addition to environmental concerns and abundance issues , low - density materials are also of interest for applications due to their potential for large specific powers , and the associated reduced mass requirements . for instance , mg@xmath11si is an example of a material that possesses all of the above desired properties and good thermoelectric performance.@xcite the higher manganese silicides ( mnsi@xmath13 , @xmath14@xmath30.25 ) are another group of low - cost , abundant materials with promising thermoelectric performance.@xcite it is this combination of abundant and low - density materials that brought us to examine another silicide , nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 , of which little is known beyond the crystallographic structure .",
    "nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 is isostructural with cu@xmath0sbse@xmath1,@xcite which has recently been shown to possess moderate thermoelectric performance . at the materials level ,",
    "thermoelectric performance is quantified via the dimensionless figure of merit @xmath9=@xmath15/@xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the seebeck coefficient , @xmath2 the electrical resistivity , and @xmath18 the thermal conductivity . in cu@xmath0sbse@xmath1",
    ", @xmath9 reaches between 0.7 and 0.9 near @xmath3650k , with the exact value depending on the particular alloying and doping employed.@xcite    nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 and cu@xmath0sbse@xmath1 are isostructural with the mineral famatinite cu@xmath0sbs@xmath1 , which is a member of the stannite ( cu@xmath11fesns@xmath1 ) group .",
    "these materials possess a tetragonal unit cell ( space group @xmath19@xmath202@xmath21 , no .",
    "121 ) based on the zinc - blende structure with all atoms being tetrahedrally coordinated ( though the tetrahedral coordinations are slightly distorted with bond angles deviating from the ideal 109.5@xmath22 ) . in cu@xmath0sbse@xmath1 , cu and sb",
    "are tetrahedrally coordinated by se , whereas in nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 , ni and si are surrounded by p.    in this work , we characterize nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 , and find it to be a narrow gap semiconductor where holes naturally dominate conduction .",
    "this material is too resistive to yield large thermoelectric performance , and thus doping studies were undertaken . at first , we attempted to substitute co for ni , though this did not appear to produce extrinsic holes .",
    "thus , in analogy with si and sige alloys , we attempted to use boron as a hole dopant , and nominal compositions nisi@xmath23b@xmath24p@xmath1 were found to produce extrinsic hole concentrations .",
    "if boron substitutes for silicon , it does so with a relatively limited solubility , as the maximum hole concentration observed in these samples is approximately 5@xmath510@xmath6@xmath7 at 200k .",
    "it is also possible the extrinsic hole concentration is associated with off - stoichiometry of the nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 phase induced by the nominal compositions employed . with some modest success at doping , it was clear that the lattice thermal conductivity severely limits the thermoelectric performance . thus , we attempted to alloy in 20% ge on the si site , and this resulted in only a small decrease in @xmath18 ( primarily at low temperatures ) .",
    "the net result is a rather low figure of merit @xmath9@xmath30.1 at 700k .",
    "further improvements in performance may be achieved with higher doping levels , as the material has a relatively high band mass , though a reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity is also necessary .",
    "therefore , this material is unlikely to be pursued in further detail unless theoretical calculations provide insights into doping or suggest anomalous performance for other regions of the electronic structure .",
    "polycrystalline samples were prepared by first arc - melting high - purity ni , si , b , and ge as appropriate for the nominal compositions listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the resulting ingot was hand ground to a fine powder , and combined with red phosphorus in a silica ampoule that was subsequently sealed under vacuum .",
    "the ampoule was heated to 450@xmath22c , held at this temperature for 10h , then heated to 900@xmath22c and held for 100h to allow phosphorus to react through the vapor phase . after cooling ,",
    "the ampoule was shaken vigorously and heated to 900@xmath22c for another @xmath350 - 100h to ensure full reaction of the phosphorus . during the first heating ,",
    "a rate of 25@xmath22c / h was employed , and 50@xmath22c / h was used for the second heat treatment .",
    "indications of decomposition and significant volatilization of phosphorus were observed when sintering of a cold - pressed pellet at 1000@xmath22c was attempted , and thus @xmath3900@xmath22c was used as a high temperature limit .    after heating , the powders were hand ground and consolidated with a hot press .",
    "hot pressing was performed in a graphite die within a graphite furnace , using pressures near 10,000psi and a maximum temperature near 900@xmath22c@xmath2550@xmath22c .",
    "after exposure to the maximum force / temperature for @xmath31h , the force was removed for a one hour stress - free anneal , followed by cooling to 675@xmath22c over one hour , at which temperature the furnace was turned off to cool more rapidly .",
    "this procedure resulted in samples with densities greater than 92% of the crystallographic density .",
    "the samples are relatively stable in air , with only a very slight tarnish appearing after several months .",
    "grinding was generally done in a helium glove box , though grinding in air prior to hot pressing did not appear to affect the transport properties provided the reaction was complete .",
    "the acrid smell of phosphorus was experienced upon cutting or grinding the final specimens .",
    "the polycrystalline samples were found , by powder x - ray diffraction , to contain mainly the desired nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 phase . the undoped nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 sample contained a small amount ( @xmath262 wt.% ) of ni@xmath11si .",
    "rietveld refinement of the room temperature powder diffraction data using the published structural model@xcite yielded lattice parameters of @xmath27=5.155(1)@xmath28 and @xmath29=10.345(1)@xmath28 .",
    "boron substitution resulted in a negligible change in lattice parameters .",
    "with increasing nominal concentrations of boron , the impurity phase(s ) changed from ni@xmath11si to bp and nisi , with up to 3% and 6.4% , respectively , observed in sample 4,b in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "as discussed below , transport measurements suggest that the boron solubility limit was reached by the nominal composition of nisi@xmath30b@xmath31p@xmath1 .",
    "it is also possible that the phase width of nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 is reached at this nominal composition and boron does not incorporate into the lattice . in the sample with nominal composition nisi@xmath11ge@xmath32b@xmath33p@xmath1 ,",
    "the diffraction revealed about 87% purity of the main phase , with bp ( 7wt.% ) and ge ( 6 wt.% ) as the primary secondary phases .",
    "the lattice parameters indicate some ge incorporated into the lattice , though , with refinement yielding @xmath27=5.169(1)@xmath28 and @xmath29=10.367(1)@xmath28 .",
    ".nominal compositions and lattice parameters of the nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 and doped - nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 samples presented in this study .",
    "[ cols=\">,<,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    transport data suggested very high hole concentrations are necessary to achieve large thermoelectric performance , and thus we attempted to synthesize samples with large concentrations of boron .",
    "the secondary phases seem to have little influence on the transport properties , as similar results were obtained on the different samples . to allow for an appreciation of the variations in properties across batches , we report data on several boron containing samples that possess similar transport properties and thus likely possess similar amounts of boron in the primary phase .",
    "p@xmath1 , as well as b- and ge - doped compositions as listed in table [ tab1].,width=288 ]    seebeck coefficient @xmath17 , electrical resistivity @xmath2 , and hall coefficient @xmath34 measurements were utilized to investigate the electrical properties ; the hall carrier density is @xmath35=1/@xmath36 .",
    "below 300k , these measurements were performed in a quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms ) .",
    "the thermoelectric measurements , including the thermal conductivity @xmath18 , were performed using the ppms thermal transport option ( tto ) , and the hall effect was measured using the resistivity option on the ppms . for tto measurements ,",
    "gold - plated copper leads were attached to the sample using silver epoxy ( h20e epo - tek ) , and silver paste ( dupont 4929n ) was utilized to obtain low resistance contacts for hall effect measurements performed using 0.025 mm pt wires .",
    "hall coefficients were obtained from a fit of the hall resistance versus magnetic field , with maximum fields of @xmath256tesla employed .",
    "high temperature thermoelectric performance was assessed using an ulvac zem-3 m8 to measure @xmath17 and @xmath2 .",
    "the thermal conductivity @xmath18 ( above room temperature ) was calculated via @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the density .",
    "the specific heat capacity @xmath39 was approximated using the dulong petit limit of @xmath40= 3r , calculated according to nominal composition .",
    "the differences between @xmath40 and @xmath41 are assumed to be negligible at the temperatures of interest , and this estimation likely results in a slight overestimation of @xmath9 at the highest temperatures .",
    "the thermal diffusivity @xmath42 was obtained on @xmath310 mm diameter discs between 1.5 and 2 mm thick , in an anter fl-5000 with a graphite furnace ; data analysis followed astm 1461 for flash diffusivity .",
    "no sign of oxidation occurred during the high temperature measurements , and data collected on cooling were consistent with those collected on heating .",
    "nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 was found to behave similar to a narrow gap semiconductor with a low concentration of charge carriers .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : tto ] , activated electrical conduction is observed for nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 below room temperature .",
    "between 150 and 250k , a simple activation energy was obtained from fitting to @xmath2=@xmath43exp[@xmath44/kt ] , resulting in @xmath44=0.11ev , which is equivalent to a fundamental band gap of 0.22ev .",
    "however , the fit to this simple activated behavior becomes poor when wider temperature ranges are considered .",
    "consistent with the semiconducting - like behavior , a large seebeck coefficient is observed in nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 , as shown in figure [ fig : tto]b .",
    "also consistent with this behavior , the hall carrier density @xmath35 increases with increasing temperature for nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 , as shown in figure [ fig : hall]a .",
    "we emphasize that this is a single band @xmath35 , and may not reflect the true carrier density if electrons are also contributing to electrical transport .    in order to probe the potential for thermoelectric performance , we attempted to hole - dope nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 .",
    "we first tried the substitution of co for ni , but this sample had a higher resistivity than undoped nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 at 300k , and also displayed activated conduction below room temperature .",
    "we then found that boron successfully increased the hole concentration in samples with nominal compositions of nisi@xmath23b@xmath24p@xmath1 .",
    "however , synthesis with @xmath14=0.02 , 0.10 , 0.20 , 0.40 all yielded similar transport properties , as observed in figure [ fig : tto ] .",
    "one explanation for this trend is that the solubility limit of boron has been reached .",
    "hole - doped samples of nisi@xmath23b@xmath24p@xmath1 behave metallic above @xmath3 150k with @xmath2 increasing with increasing @xmath45 . similarly , the seebeck coefficients of these samples increase with increasing @xmath45 , consistent with extrinsically doped samples .",
    "the seebeck coefficients remain rather large in these doped samples , with @xmath17@xmath3250@xmath4v / k obtained at 300k .",
    "the hall carrier concentration and mobility @xmath46 of boron- and boron / germanium - doped nisi@xmath47p@xmath1 are shown in figure [ fig : hall ] .",
    "as observed , the values of @xmath35 are relatively temperature independent , and fairly similar for the different nominal boron concentrations .",
    "this is consistent with similar @xmath2 and @xmath17 in the various samples .",
    "this result suggests that , if boron substitutes for silicon , the solubility limit of boron has been reached . if lattice - incorporated boron atoms are fully ionized and contribute one hole to the system , then a solubility limit of @xmath30.2%b per silicon is obtained from the hall carrier concentration of approximately 5@xmath510@xmath6holes/@xmath48 at 200k .",
    "this seems reasonable considering the solubility limits of boron in silicon , which are @xmath3 2@xmath510@xmath6b/@xmath48 at 700@xmath22c and @xmath3 1@xmath510@xmath49b/@xmath48 at 900@xmath22c.@xcite the small increase of @xmath35 above @xmath3200k may be the result of some carriers being activated from other impurities or across the band gap .",
    "the hole mobility of boron - doped nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 is found to be approximately 12@xmath8/v / s at 300k",
    ". the mobility increases with decreasing temperature , consistent with a carrier mean free path limited by phonon scattering .",
    "however , this behavior only occurs down to @xmath3125k , where the mobility reaches a maximum of approximately 18@xmath8/v / s .",
    "while @xmath46 decreases upon cooling below 125k , @xmath35 remains relatively constant , which may suggest that additional carrier scattering mechanisms are important at low @xmath45 .",
    "ionized impurity scattering generally leads to a mobility that increases as @xmath50 , though the low - t rise in @xmath46 occurs more slowly than @xmath50 in boron - doped nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 .",
    "it is also possible that anderson localization occurs due to disorder in the lattice , causing a mobility gap that leads to an increase in @xmath2 at low-@xmath45 . also , we note that the high - temperature decay occurs more slowly than the @xmath51 behavior expected for a lightly doped semiconductor ( or even the @xmath52 behavior expected for a degenerate semiconductor ) . therefore , it is possible impurity band conduction is important in these materials or grain boundary scattering influences transport .",
    "p@xmath1 , as well as b- and ge - doped compositions as listed in table [ tab1].,width=288 ]    the hole mobility of boron - doped nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 is less than that of isostructural cu@xmath0sbse@xmath1 .",
    "the mobility of undoped cu@xmath0sbse@xmath1 is @xmath341@xmath8/v / s at 300k , with a hole concentration of 7.5@xmath510@xmath53@xmath7.@xcite the mobility of undoped nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 is not shown in figure [ fig : hall ] because the single band model likely fails for the undoped composition . at a more comparable hole concentration of 6.3@xmath510@xmath6@xmath7 in cu@xmath0sb@xmath54sn@xmath55se@xmath1",
    "the mobility is approximately 35@xmath8/v / s , and it is 31@xmath8/v / s in cu@xmath0sb@xmath56sn@xmath57se@xmath1 at 300k.@xcite given that the carrier mobility in doped nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 is dominated by phonon scattering at room temperature , it seems unlikely that the boron dopant is leading to this large difference in carrier mobility .",
    "therefore , the hole mobility in nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 appears to be inherently lower than in the copper - based analogues .    to better understand the differences between transport in nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 and cu@xmath0sbse@xmath1",
    ", we consider a parabolic band analysis of the hall and seebeck coefficients ( equations [ eqn : alpha][eqn : f ] ) .",
    "analysis of the hall and seebeck coefficient data allows the carrier mass @xmath58 to be obtained .",
    "when phonon scattering limits the relaxation time of charge carriers , the mobility is expected to scale as @xmath4@xmath59@xmath60 .",
    "therefore , even small changes in the band mass can have significant influence on carrier transport .    within a single parabolic band model ,",
    "the seebeck coefficient is a function of the reduced electrochemical potential @xmath61 and scattering parameter @xmath62 :    @xmath63    the scattering parameter @xmath62 is used to incorporate the energy dependence of the carrier relaxation time , @xmath64 .",
    "the value of @xmath62 influences @xmath17 , but @xmath65 does not . in this analysis",

    ", this process yields 2.9 - 3.7@xmath73 for the various samples of boron - doped nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 . from literature values for @xmath35 and @xmath17 in cu@xmath0sbse@xmath1",
    "( corresponding to the @xmath4 values noted above),@xcite we obtain @xmath74 depending on the particular sample .",
    "therefore , it is clear that the band mass is much larger in nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 than in cu@xmath0sbse@xmath1 , and this likely contributes to the lower mobility .",
    "this large band mass results in a relatively large seebeck coefficient in nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 , but the impact on carrier mobility is detrimental to the thermoelectric performance of nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 .    the thermal conductivity of nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 is approximately 10w / m / k at 300k .",
    "boron doping reduces the low - temperature value of @xmath18 slightly . in an attempt to further reduce @xmath18 , we substituted ge for si , in addition to the boron doping .",
    "this results in some additional suppression of @xmath18 at low-@xmath45 , though little change is observed at higher temperatures .",
    "interestingly , @xmath18 does not display much temperature dependence below room temperature , even in undoped nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 .",
    "this suggests there may be some disorder in the system , or perhaps grain boundaries or secondary phases are reducing @xmath18 at low-@xmath45 .",
    "we note that due to the large values of @xmath2 , the lattice thermal conductivity @xmath75 dominates @xmath18 for all samples below @xmath3600k .",

    "interestingly , the decrease in @xmath2 with increasing @xmath45 for undoped nisi@xmath0p@xmath1 turns into a nearly temperature independent @xmath2 above @xmath3400k , and the corresponding seebeck coefficient is large and relatively temperature independent .",
    "the boron - doped samples display typical doped semiconductor behavior at high temperatures , with the resistivity and seebeck coefficients increasing with increasing temperature until the effects of minority carrier activation are observed near 650k .",
    "the thermal conductivity decreases with increasing @xmath45 in all samples , consistent with the dominant role of phonon - phonon scattering in these crystalline materials . as noted above , the substitution of 20% ge ( nominal composition ) did not result in a significant reduction in @xmath18 above 300k . for comparison ,",
    "the thermal conductivity of cu@xmath0sbs@xmath1 reaches approximately 1.5w / m / k at 600k.@xcite    p@xmath1 , as well as b- and ge - doped compositions as listed in table [ tab1].,width=288 ]    the maximum in @xmath76 , which is relatively unpronounced in these materials , can be utilized to estimate the thermal band gap by @xmath77=2@xmath78.@xcite this analysis suggests that the band gap is between 0.43 and 0.50ev , which is about two times larger than that obtained from the analysis of @xmath79 at lower temperatures .",
    "it is possible that one of these estimates of @xmath77 is influenced by the activation of carriers from an impurity band . without high temperature hall effect data the source for this discrepancy is difficult to isolate .",

    "boron - doping greatly improves both the power factor and @xmath9 , and additional improvements would likely come with higher doping levels .",

    "it is possible that altering the si / p ratio would permit higher doping levels to be achieved , and may also allow @xmath82-type behavior to be probed .",
