    "relativistic jets are the most powerful manifestations of the release of energy produced by super - massive black holes ( smbh ) in the centers of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . in about 15 per cent of agn",
    "the accretion disc is at the base of a bipolar outflow of relativistic plasma , which may extend well beyond the host galaxy , forming the spectacular lobes of plasma visible in radio .",
    "the jet emission is observed across the entire electromagnetic spectrum . when the jet axis is closely aligned with our line of sight",
    ", the rest - frame radiation is strongly amplified due to doppler boosting with a large fraction of the output observed at high energy , giving rise to the blazar phenomenon .",
    "radio galaxies are typically viewed at larger angles , with a less extreme amplification of the emission @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "a very small fraction of radio galaxies is observed at high energy @xcite . the discovery in 2008 by the large area telescope ( lat ) on board the _ fermi _ satellite of @xmath0-ray emission from radio - loud narrow - line seyfert 1s ( nlsy1 ) revealed the presence of a possible new class of agns with relativistic jets .",

    "nlsy1 is a class of agn identified by @xcite and defined in terms of the optical properties of its members : narrow permitted lines ( fwhm ( h@xmath12 ) @xmath13 2000 km s@xmath7 ) , [ oiii]/h@xmath12 @xmath13 3 , and a bump due to fe ii ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of the most surprising aspects related to these nlsy1s was the detection of flaring activity in @xmath0 rays .",
    "a few strong @xmath0-ray flares were observed from pmn j0948@xmath10022 @xcite , with an apparent isotropic @xmath0-ray luminosity up to 10@xmath9 erg s@xmath7 , comparable to that of the bright flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ; e.g. , pks 1510@xmath14089 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "in addition , the high apparent @xmath0-ray luminosity observed in these objects suggests a large doppler boosting and thus a small viewing angle , similar to blazars .",
    "these are important indications that nlsy1s are able to host relativistic jets as powerful as those in blazars .",
    "pmn j0948@xmath10022 could be considered the archetypal object of a new class of @xmath0-ray emitting agns ; therefore several multifrequency campaigns were performed to investigate in detail its characteristics over the whole electromagnetic spectrum @xcite .",

    "these data are complemented by the monitoring campaigns performed by the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) and the monitoring of jets in active galactic nuclei with vlba experiments ( mojave ) at 15 ghz , and by the catalina real - time transient survey ( crts ) in @xmath15-band .",
    "the aim of the paper is to discuss the radio - to-@xmath0-ray activity from pmn j0948@xmath10022 during 2012 december2013 august .",
    "this allows us to characterize the sed of the 2013 flaring state of the source in order to compare the sed with that observed in a different activity state observed in 2011 may , to investigate the emission mechanisms of this source and to discuss its properties in the context of the blazar scenario .",

    "have shown a different delay or no indication of correlated variability @xcite , thus making the radio - gamma connection complex in this object .",

    "further observations with the current generation of iacts ( veritas , magic , and h.e.s.s . ) , especially during the peak of @xmath0-ray activity , may lead to vhe detections of this object . with a lower energy threshold and better sensitivity , future observations with the cherenkov telescope array will constrain the level of @xmath0-ray emission at 100 gev and below @xcite .",

    "we compared the broad - band sed of the 2013 flaring activity state with that from an intermediate activity state of pmn j0948@xmath10022 observed in 2011 .",
    "contrary to what was observed for some fsrqs ( e.g. , pks 0537@xmath14441 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the two seds , modelled as an ec component of seed photons from a dust torus , could not be modeled by changing only the electron distribution parameters .",
    "a higher magnetic field is needed for modelling the high activity state of pmn j0948@xmath10022 , as was also observed for the fsrq pks 2142@xmath1475 @xcite . in a compton dominance vs.",
    "synchrotron peak frequency plot ( see figure  [ cd_fig ] ) , the values for the two activity states of pmn j0948@xmath10022 lie in the same region occupied by the fsrqs , as well as the other nlsy1 sbs 0846@xmath1513 .",
    "this suggests that the ec scattering is likely the dominant mechanism for producing high - energy emission in pmn j0948@xmath10022 , confirming the similarities between @xmath0-ray emitting nlsy1s and fsrqs .",
    "the inverse compton ( ic ) peak of this source seems to lie at 100 mev or below . with the improved sensitivity of the lat at low energies with pass 8 data @xcite we will be able to characterize in more detail the ic bump of pmn j0948@xmath10022 , and therefore the sed modelling .",
    "in addition to the large uncertainties on the bh mass of the nlsy1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , the structure of the host galaxies is unclear . for four out of five nlsy1s detected in @xmath0 rays by lat ,",
    "no high - resolution observations of their host galaxies are available .",
