    "the nature of the interaction between the hydrogen bond ( hb ) network of liquid water and the solvated chloride ion ( a member of the hofmeister series ) is currently a topic under intense research due to its fundamental importance in biochemistry , atmospheric chemistry , and geological processes  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the interaction between the solvated chloride ion , cl@xmath1 , and the surrounding aqueous environment has been successfully probed by a variety of techniques  @xcite . in particular , x - ray and neutron scattering as well as x - ray absorption measurements ,",
    "have been used to investigate the solvation structure of aqueous chloride solutions , providing experimental determination of the cl - o and cl - h radial distribution functions ( rdf ) , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and the associated coordination number , _",
    "i.e. _ , the number of water molecules populating the first solvation shell surrounding a given cl@xmath1 ion  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the electronic structure associated with this fundamental aqueous ionic solution was studied by delahay  @xcite and winter _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , in which state - of - the - art photoemission spectroscopy ( pes ) was utilized to characterize the valence 3@xmath4 bands of the solvated cl@xmath1 ion , which were found to be approximately 1.251.50 ev above the valence band maximum ( vbm ) of liquid water .    from a theoretical and computational point of view",
    ", first - principles based computational methods such as _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( aimd ) have become powerful tools in the study of condensed - phase systems such as liquids  @xcite and aqueous ionic solutions  @xcite . with the aimd technique ,",
    "the nuclear potential energy surface is generated `` on the fly '' from the electronic ground state  @xcite without the need for empirical input , thereby allowing for a quantum mechanical treatment of not only the structure and dynamics of a given molecular system of interest , but also its electronic and dielectric properties , as well as potential chemical reactions  @xcite ( _ i.e. _ , the breaking and forming of chemical bonds ) . since the initial pioneering simulations of liquid water ,  @xcite aimd has been applied to many complex problems in biology , chemistry , and energy research , _",
    "e.g. _ , the designing of efficient catalysts for hydrogen production  @xcite and the modeling of the auto - ionization  @xcite and electrocatalytic splitting of water ,  @xcite to name a few .",
    "in particular , aimd simulations employing density functional theory ( dft ) as the source of the underlying quantum mechanical potential have been used to generate reasonably accurate microscopic descriptions of the structure of the aqueous chloride ion solution ,  @xcite with rdfs and associated coordination numbers that were consistent with the available experimental data .",
    "these studies found that the predicted solvation structure in the aqueous chloride ion solution is moderately dependent on the exchange - correlation ( xc ) potential , with semi - local generalized - gradient approximation  @xcite ( gga ) functionals such as pbe  @xcite and blyp  @xcite yielding similar predictions to hybrid functionals such as pbe0 .",
    "@xcite in addition , the hb network of water was found to be only locally perturbed by the presence of the solvated ion , a finding which is consistent with the general expectation that cl@xmath1 is a weak disrupter of the aqueous environment  @xcite .",
    "however , these studies also demonstrated that the electronic structure of this aqueous ionic solution is very sensitive to the adopted xc approximation  @xcite .",
    "in particular , higher - level electronic structure calculations performed on gga - dft generated configurations ( structures ) were found to significantly underestimate the energy levels of the solvated cl@xmath1 ion , with resulting energetics that can even be qualitatively incorrect  @xcite .    in the study of an aqueous ionic solution ,",
    "an accurate theoretical description of the underlying hb network is a prerequisite for characterizing and understanding the interaction between a solvated or embedded ion and its surrounding environment .",
    "in neat liquid water , the predictive power of dft - based aimd in the microscopic description of the hb network critically depends on the accuracy of the underlying xc functional utilized in the quantum mechanical treatment of the electronic degrees of freedom . in this regard , it is now clear that the most widely used xc functionals , _",
    "i.e. _ , the class of functionals based on the gga , have severe limitations when applied to liquid water  @xcite as well as the crystalline phases of ice .",
    "@xcite most notably , gga - dft suffers from the presence of self - interaction error ( sie )  @xcite and the neglect of non - local electron correlation effects that are responsible for van der waals ( vdw ) or dispersion interactions ; as a result , these deficiencies in the gga xc potential manifest as significant overstructuring and excessively sluggish dynamics in aqueous systems such as ambient liquid water . beyond the choice of the xc functional ,",
    "most aimd simulations of liquid water and aqueous ionic solutions performed to date have adopted classical mechanics for the nuclear equations of motion and therefore completely neglect nuclear quantum effects ( nqe)another approximation that has been deemed insufficient for a highly accurate quantitative description of the microscopic structure and hb network in aqueous systems . in the case of liquid water , light atoms such as hydrogen deviate significantly from classical behavior even at room temperature ,  @xcite as evidenced by experimental isotope effect studies which demonstrated a softening of the liquid structure ( _ i.e. _ , in the comparison of h@xmath5o to d@xmath5o ) .",
    "@xcite hence the neglect of nqe in aqueous systems such as ambient liquid water leads to overstructuring in the predicted rdfs .",
    "@xcite    a commonly adopted method to alleviate the deleterious effects of sie in gga - dft is the use of hybrid xc functionals , wherein a fraction of exact ( or hartree - fock ) exchange ( @xmath0 ) is included in the density functional approximation .",
    "due to the relatively high computational cost associated with these xc functionals , applications of hybrid dft have mostly been restricted to small gas - phase clusters of water ,  @xcite although recently hybrid functionals have been applied in the study of several crystalline phases of ice  @xcite and liquid water .",
    "@xcite in comparison to ggas , these studies demonstrated that the energetic , structural , and vibrational properties of these aqueous systems , as predicted by hybrid dft calculations , are generally in closer agreement with the available experimental data .",
    "@xcite indeed , an accurate microscopic description of the hb network by hybrid xc functionals has a non - negligible effect on the theoretical characterization of the solvated chloride ion . in this regard",
    ", it was found that the use of hybrid dft was crucial in obtaining a qualitatively correct energy difference between cl@xmath1 and the vbm of liquid water .",
    "in addition , both hybrid and gga xc functionals lack the ability to describe vdw / dispersion interactions , which arise from non - local dynamical electron correlation and have a substantial effect on the microscopic structure of condensed - phase aqueous systems .",
    "in fact , the explicit inclusion of vdw interactions in dft has been shown to significantly improve upon the theoretical description of the transition pressures among the high - pressure phases of ice  @xcite and the predicted equilibrium density of liquid water .",
    "@xcite while many recent studies have concluded that the structure of liquid water significantly softens when vdw interactions are accounted for in the underlying xc potential , the extent to which these non - local forces affect the structure of liquid water is largely dependent upon the given approach utilized to facilitate vdw - inclusive dft .",
    "@xcite hence , the inclusion of vdw or dispersion interactions in the underlying xc potential is expected to have a non - negligible effect on the theoretical description of the hb network and must be accounted for in the study of aqueous ionic solutions such as the solvated chloride ion .    recently it was shown that utilization of the hybrid pbe0 functional ,  @xcite which includes 25% exact exchange , in conjunction with a fully self - consistent ( sc ) implementation of the density - dependent vdw / dispersion correction of tkatchenko and scheffler  @xcite ( ts - vdw ) ,  _ i.e. _ , the pbe0+ts - vdw(sc ) xc functional , yields an oxygen - oxygen structure factor , @xmath6 , and corresponding rdf , @xmath7 , that are in quantitative agreement with the best available experimental data .",
    "@xcite this level of agreement between  _ ab initio _ simulations and experiment was attributed to an increase in the relative population of water molecules in the interstitial region ( _ i.e. _ , the region between the first and second coordination shells ) , a collective reorganization in the liquid phase which is facilitated by a weakening of the hb strength by the use of a hybrid xc functional , coupled with a relative stabilization of the resultant disordered liquid water configurations by the inclusion of long - range vdw / dispersion interactions .",
    "in fact , this increasingly more accurate description of the underlying hb network in liquid water also yielded other correlation functions , such as the oxygen - hydrogen rdf , @xmath8 , and the higher - order oxygen - oxygen - oxygen triplet angular distribution , @xmath9 , which encodes the degree of local tetrahedrality , as well as electrostatic properties , such as the effective molecular dipole moment , that are in much better agreement with experiment .",
    "@xcite in this regard , the overall agreement between experiment and the pbe0+ts - vdw(sc ) description of the microscopic structure of ambient liquid water is indeed a very promising starting point for accurately investigating the structural and energetic properties that characterize the aqueous chloride ion solution , which is the main focus of the work reported herein .",
    "in this work , we have systematically performed a series of car - parrinello aimd simulations  @xcite of the aqueous chloride ion solution at ambient conditions using a hierarchy of different xc functionals .",
    "the sequence of xc functionals employed herein includes the standard semi - local gga of perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe ) ,  @xcite the corresponding hybrid pbe0  @xcite which includes 25% exact exchange , and the self - consistent ( sc ) dispersion - corrected analogs  @xcite thereof , _",
    "i.e. _ , pbe+ts - vdw(sc ) and pbe0+ts - vdw(sc ) , based on the tkatchenko - scheffler  @xcite density - dependent vdw / dispersion functional .",
    "all of these aimd simulations were performed in the canonical ( @xmath10 ) ensemble using periodic simple cubic simulation cells containing cl@xmath1 ion in ( h@xmath5o)@xmath11 with lattice parameters set to reproduce the experimental density of liquid water at ambient conditions .",
    "all of the aimd simulations were initially equilibrated for approximately 6 ps and then continued for an additional 2050 ps for data collection ( with the aimd simulations employing the hybrid pbe0 functional at the lower end of this range of simulation times ) . since a classical treatment of the nuclear degrees of freedom",
    "was found to be insufficient for a quantitatively accurate description of the microscopic structure of ambient liquid water , we have performed all aimd simulations in this work at the elevated temperature of 330 k , a technique that is suggested by the lowest - order perturbative expansion of the free energy ( in @xmath12 ) to account for the quantum mechanical nature of the nuclear degrees of freedom .",
    "@xcite in practice , this increase of approximately 30 k in the simulation temperature has been found to mimic the nuclear quantum effects ( nqe ) in structural quantities such as the oxygen - oxygen radial distribution function ( @xmath7 ) in both dft  @xcite and force field  @xcite based md simulations of liquid water .",
    "all calculations reported herein were performed within the plane - wave and pseudopotential framework and utilized a modified development version of the quantum espresso ( qe ) software package .",
    "@xcite to meet the additional computational demands associated with large - scale aimd simulations based on hybrid xc functionals , we have employed a linear scaling o(@xmath13 ) exact exchange algorithm that exploits the natural sparsity associated with the real - space maximally localized wannier function ( mlwf )  @xcite representation of the occupied kohn - sham electronic states .",
    "@xcite in addition , we have also developed and utilized a linear scaling o(@xmath13 ) self - consistent implementation of the ts - vdw dispersion correction ,  @xcite which provides a framework for computing atomic @xmath14 dispersion coefficients as explicit functionals of the charge density , _",

    "@xcite more explicit descriptions of the theoretical methods employed herein can be found in ref . [  ] .",
    "the car - parrinello ( cp )  @xcite equations of motion for the nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom were integrated using the standard verlet algorithm and a time step of 4.0 a.u . ( @xmath16 0.1 fs ) . to ensure an adiabatic separation between the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom in the cp dynamics",
    ", we used a fictitious electronic mass of 300 a.u .",
    ", which was found to be a reasonable choice for the simulation of water ,  @xcite and the nuclear mass of deuterium for each hydrogen atom .",
    "all electronic wavefunctions were expanded using a plane wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 72 ry , and the interactions between the valence electrons and the ions ( consisting of the nuclei and their corresponding frozen - core electrons ) were treated with troullier - martins type norm - conserving pseudopotentials .",
    "@xcite ionic temperatures were controlled with massive nos - hoover chain thermostats ,  @xcite each with a chain length of 4 .",
    "@xcite a neutralizing background charge was included in the ewald summation of the electrostatic energy to compensate for the net negative charge of the chloride ion solution .    to examine the electronic structure surrounding the solvated chloride ion , we have performed wavefunction optimizations ( _ i.e. _ , self - consistent solutions of the non - linear kohn - sham equations ) using the pbe , pbe0 ( 25% exact exchange ) , and bhlyp  @xcite ( 50% exact exchange ) xc functionals on a set of configurations ( structures ) selected at even intervals along a given md trajectory .",
    "real - space integration of the orbital densities surrounding the solvated chloride ion was performed within a sphere of radius @xmath17   to determine the ionic contribution to the overall electronic structure and to identify the highest - occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) states .",

    "in this regard , it was previously found that the energy level of the solvated cl@xmath1 ion is quite sensitive to both the underlying molecular structure as well as the choice of the electronic structure method employed during ground state wavefunction optimization .",

    "[ fig : all - pbe0 ]    to accomplish this goal , we first performed band structure calculations with the hybrid pbe0 xc functional based on structures ( configurations ) generated with aimd simulations at the pbe , pbe+ts - vdw(sc ) , pbe0 , and pbe0+ts - vdw(sc ) levels of theory . with a self - consistent solution to the non - linear kohn - sham ( ks ) equations , we projected the optimized ground - state ks eigenfunctions onto the solvated cl@xmath1 ion with a radius of @xmath17  .",
    "@xcite the resulting total density of states ( dos ) and real - space projected dos ( pdos ) computed at the pbe0 level of theory are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : all - pbe0 ] , from which it is evident that the total dos of the aqueous cl@xmath1 ion solution is dominated by the features belonging to the valence electrons of liquid water . in this regard , the oxygen @xmath20 states are located well above ( @xmath21 ev ) the oxygen semi - core @xmath22 states , and can be further decomposed into three features , corresponding to the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 bands representing the covalently bonded and non - bonded ( lone pair ) electrons .",
    "as far as the pdos of the solvated cl@xmath1 ion is concerned , the @xmath26 states of the cl@xmath1 ion were found to be between the @xmath22 and @xmath20 bands of liquid water while the @xmath27 states of the cl@xmath1 ion were found to be located at the edge of the vbm of liquid water  a picture which is consistent with the pes measurements in aqueous cl@xmath1 ionic solutions .",
    "@xcite moreover , it can be seen that the total dos computed based on molecular configurations generated from different aimd trajectories remain very similar in terms of the peak positions and spectral distributions .",
    "this finding is indicative of the fact that the band structure of liquid water is rather insensitive to the underlying molecular configurations ( _ i.e. _ , to whether or not @xmath0 and/or non - local vdw / dispersion interactions are accounted for in the underlying xc potential ) .",
    "in sharp contrast , the relative position of the orbital levels associated with the solvated cl@xmath1 ion with respect to the vbm of liquid water shows a much stronger dependence on the underlying molecular configurations . as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : all - pbe0 ] , the pdos computed at the pbe0 level of theory based on molecular configurations generated from the pbe - aimd trajectory is mostly located below the vbm of liquid water , yielding a value of @xmath28 ev ( see table  [ table2 ] ) . with exact exchange and/or non - local vdw / dispersion interactions accounted for in the underlying potential to generate the aimd trajectories , the distribution of the pdos becomes more prominantly separated from the vbm of liquid water . as a result , the computed @xmath19 increases in the direction of the experimental value of @xmath29 1.251.50 ev as shown in table  [ table2 ] , a result that we attribute to the weakened interaction between the cl@xmath1 ion and its surrounding water molecules with the use of vdw - inclusive hybrid xc functionals . as discussed above in sec .",
    "[ sec : solvation ] , the collective effects of @xmath0 and non - local vdw / dispersion interactions lead to a net decrease in the strength of the hydrogen bonds existing between the lone pair electrons of the cl@xmath1 ion and the water molecules residing in the first solvation shell . with the positions of the first maximum in @xmath2 and @xmath3 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , slightly increased , hybridization between the cl@xmath1 @xmath27 and the oxygen @xmath20 orbitals ( located at the edge of the liquid water valence band ) becomes less favorable .",
    "we note in passing that this explanation is consistent with the increased @xmath19 depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : all - pbe0 ] .",
    "ion solution computed using the ( a ) pbe , ( b ) pbe0 , and ( c ) bhlyp xc functionals based on structures ( configurations ) generated from an aimd trajectory at the pbe0+ts - vdw(sc ) level of theory . the dos and pdos above were obtained from electronic structure calculations on 200 configurations taken from the aimd trajectory.,width=302 ]    from the above discussion , one can see that an accurate prediction of the electronic properties of the solvated cl@xmath1 ion crucially depends on the description of the interaction between the @xmath4 electrons of cl and o. in this regard , the more accurate prediction of the hydrogen bond tends to discourage hybridization among these @xmath4 orbitals , thereby increasing @xmath19 towards the experimental value .",
    "this trend is even more pronounced when different xc approximations are utilized in the theoretical treatment of the electronic structure . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbe0-vdw ] , we now present the dos and pdos of the aqueous cl@xmath1 ion solution based on ground - state wavefunction optimizations performed at the pbe , pbe0 , and bhlyp levels of theory . in this case , the underlying molecular structures or configurations are kept fixed and were taken from an aimd trajectory employing the vdw - inclusive hybrid pbe0+ts - vdw(sc ) xc potential .",
    "this choice is motivated by our recent study in which we found that the pbe0+ts - vdw(sc ) xc potential yielded a very accurate prediction of the microscopic structure of ambient liquid water that is in quantitative agreement with respect to the available scattering experiment data .",
    "@xcite    as clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : pbe0-vdw ] , the pdos of the solvated cl@xmath1 ion is significantly affected by the choice of dft functional employed in the electronic structure calculation . at the semi - local pbe - gga level of theory ,",
    "the computed value of @xmath32 ev is negative , which is opposite in sign compared to the experimental value ; however , as the fraction of @xmath0 is increased from 25% ( pbe0 ) to 50% ( bhlyp ) , the @xmath19 steadily increases to 0.34 ev and 0.92 ev , respectively , and is rapidly approaching the experimental value .",
    "again , we attribute this trend to the removal of the deleterious self - interaction error that is present in semi - local xc functionals _ via _ the admixture of exact exchange in the hybrid pbe0 and bhlyp xc functionals . as such",
    ", the electronic structure predicted by semi - local gga functionals ( such as pbe ) artificially favors the interaction of the cl@xmath1 ion and its surrounding water molecules by facilitating a greater extent of @xmath4 orbital hybridization .",
    "this effect is greatly reduced at the hybrid dft level of theory  at the bhlyp level , the eigenfunctions of the cl@xmath1 ion homo were found to have a non - negligible amplitude located on water molecules in the first coordination shell in only @xmath16 5% of the configurations .",
    "however , we note in passing that this fraction increases to over 70% when the semi - local pbe - gga xc functional is used instead ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : orbital ] ) .",
    "orbitals for the cl@xmath1 ion.,width=302 ]    these findings reported above are consistent with the previous study by zhang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite in which it was found that the use of hybrid xc functionals in generating both the electronic and molecular structure was essential for a qualitatively correct prediction of @xmath19 .",
    "the current study further indicates that accounting for non - local vdw / dispersion interactions in the generation of the underlying molecular structure is also important for obtaining a quantitatively correct theoretical prediction of this fundamental quantity in aqueous ionic solutions . by admixing 25% of @xmath0 ,",
    "the hybrid pbe0 xc functional has successfully generated an electronic structure that is qualitatively consistent with the available pes experiments .",
    "however , 25% of @xmath0 might not be sufficient to completely eliminate the effects of self - interaction error on @xmath19 ,  @xcite which can serve as an explanation for the remaining discrepancy that exists between theory and experiment .",
    "in addition , it should also be noted that an explicit treatment of nuclear quantum effects ( nqe ) , as provided by the feynman discretized path integral technique , is expected to further decrease the strength of the interaction between the cl@xmath1 ion and water  as a result , a further increase in @xmath19 towards the experimental value is anticipated with such a theoretical treatment of this fundamental aqueous ionic solution .",
    "in this work , we have systematically studied the solvation and electronic structure of the aqueous chloride ion solution using dft - based aimd which incorporates exact exchange ( @xmath0 ) and non - local vdw / dispersion interactions in the underlying xc potential . from an analysis of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we find that the inclusion of exact exchange and non - local vdw / dispersion interactions _ via _ the use of the pbe0+ts - vdw(sc ) xc functional effectively _ weakens _ the interactions between the cl@xmath1 ion and the surrounding water molecules residing in the first solvation shell and yields a mean cl - o coordination number , @xmath33 , that is in excellent agreement with the available experimental data . moreover , we found that most configurations at the vdw - inclusive hybrid pbe0+ts - vdw(sc ) level of theory can be characterized by 6-fold cl - o coordination and are predominantly comprised of distorted trigonal prism structures ",
    "findings which are strongly indicative of a significantly disordered first solvation shell surrounding the cl@xmath1 ion .    by performing a systematic series of band structure calculations on molecular structures ( configurations ) generated from aimd simulations with various differing xc potentials",
    ", we were able to selectively isolate the effects arising from the underlying molecular structure as well as the choice of the electronic structure method on the energy levels of the solvated cl@xmath1 ion relative to the vbm of liquid water ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "in doing so , we found that while the band structure of liquid water is rather insensitive to the underlying molecular configurations , the relative positions of the orbital levels associated with the solvated cl@xmath1 ion with respect to the vbm of liquid water strongly depend on the underlying molecular configurations . here",
    ", the effective weakening of the hydrogen bonds existing between the lone pair electrons of the cl@xmath1 ion and the water molecules residing in the first solvation shell due to the collective effects of @xmath0 and non - local vdw / dispersion interactions leads to a decrease in the degree of hybridization between the cl@xmath1 @xmath27 and the oxygen @xmath20 orbitals located at the edge of the liquid water valence band . in the same breath ,",
    "the pdos of the solvated cl@xmath1 ion is also significantly affected by the choice of dft functional employed in the electronic structure calculation ; as the fraction of @xmath0 was increased from 25% ( pbe0 ) to 50% ( bhlyp ) , @xmath19 steadily increased from 0.34 ev to 0.92 ev , thereby rapidly approaching the experimental value of 1.251.50 ev .    as a final set of remarks",
    ", we note that the quantitative description of the microscopic structure of the aqueous cl@xmath1 ion solution may change by further refinement of the underlying xc functional approximation , which may be accomplished by reducing the self - interaction error _ via _ fine - tuning the exchange correction  @xcite , and/or including a better description of vdw / dispersion interactions _ via _ the inclusion of beyond - pairwise interactions , as provided , for example , by the recently proposed many - body dispersion ( mbd ) scheme  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , structural refinements are also expected to result from a proper treatment of nuclear quantum effects _ via _ the feynman discretized path - integral approach , which is expected to further weaken the interactions between the solvated cl@xmath1 ion and its aqueous surroundings ; the use of such configurations in conjunction with a higher - level electronic structure theory , such as hedin s gw self - energy approximation  @xcite and/or the random phase approximation ( rpa )  @xcite , should lead to even better agreement with pes experiments on the relative energetics among the solvated cl@xmath1 orbitals and the vbm of liquid water .",
