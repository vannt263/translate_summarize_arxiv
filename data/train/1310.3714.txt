    "surveying a large sky area is one of the most common and elementary types of observation . in principle",
    ", one would want to image as wide an area of the sky as possible , at high spatial resolution and through a telescope with a large aperture . covering a wide field at high resolution",
    "requires a detector with a large physical area and many pixels , leading to high cost and complexity .",
    "astronomers deal with this problem in two ways :    * using complex and expensive arrays of detectors . * using detectors with large pixels , at the expense of resolution .",
    "we propose a novel method to address this issue .",
    "the performance of the multiplexed imaging method strongly depends on the properties of the relevant noise .",
    "we consider the following origins of noise in astronomical observations .    *",
    "* poisson noise * - the difference between the expected flux of energy coming from a light source ( or a noise source ) and the flux actually arrived . * * background noise * - the fluctuations in the number of photons originating in the space between the observer and the source ( e.g , atmospheric background noise and zodiacal light ) . * * read noise and instrumental thermal noise ( dark current ) * : the noise coming from the process of reading the data from the detector and the electrons that originate in the electronics and the detector itself .    when imaging from the ground , all types of noise exist and contribute , while when imaging from space , in some situations we can neglect the background noise and assume that the only sources of noise are the read noise and the poisson noise .",
    "a very important feature of many astronomical images is that they are almost * empty*. when we pick a random patch of sky and observe it ( not a specifically chosen close galaxy , nebula or dense star cluster ) there are very few objects with non - zero flux .",
    "most of them are either point source objects ( the size of the seeing disk ) or small patches ( like distant galaxies ) with sizes on the scale of a few arcseconds .",
    "our analysis only applies to sparse images because the source of the improvement that we offer is the sparsity of the part of the sky observed .",
    "we propose to use the sparse nature of astronomical images to effectively measure all objects contained in the corrected field of view of a telescope using a physically small detector , without reducing the resolution .",
    "this is done by projecting different areas of the focal plane simultaneously onto the detector .",
    "because of the scarcity of objects one can perform scientific measurements using the combined images with the same quality and greater efficiency compared to mosaicking .",
    "flux measurements of known sources in combined images can be done directly ( e.g to search for transients ans planets ) . using sub - observations",
    "it is possible to chart an unknown part of the sky .    in section [ sec : recovery ]",
    "we analyze both cases and present our recovery algorithm . in section [ sec : efficiency ]",
    "we analyze the efficiency gain factor of our method under different dominant noise sources and show that multiplexed imaging is very efficient when the dominant noise source is either poisson or read noise . in section [ sec : simulations ] we show simulations of our charting recovery algorithm . in section",
    "[ sec : applications ] we analyze the possible impacts of the method on instruments designed for sky surveys , finding exoplanets , looking for transients , fast photometry and lucky imaging , finding orders of magnitude potential improvements to the area observed per unit time .",
    "a conceptual optical realization of this method is discussed in ben - ami et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , and laboratory experiments with this design are ongoing .      *",
    "the focal plane is divided into @xmath0 parts , each part can be covered by the detector in a single exposure of length @xmath1 . *",
    "our device directs the light of @xmath2 parts ( @xmath3 ) onto one detector . *",
    "an observation is composed of @xmath4 sub - observations . each sub - observation is a measurement of the sum of the flux from @xmath2 areas on the focal plane . *",
    "the time each observation takes depends on the exposure time @xmath5 , readout time @xmath6 and slew time @xmath7 .",
    "when referring to two different exposure times , the duration of multiplexed imaging will be denoted by @xmath8 . * the total time required for one observation using multiplexed imaging is given by @xmath9 * regular imaging can be thought of as multiplexed imaging with @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( it will take @xmath0 observations to cover the whole area ) . in that case @xmath12 . *",
    "the efficiency @xmath13 of the system is given by the time required to cover the described area with the regular mode divided by the time required to do so with the multiplexed method , * when both observations have the same snr * , meaning @xmath14 ( and @xmath15 is adjusted to match the snr ) .",
    "* for example , under the assumptions that @xmath16 ( which is not always the case , see section [ subsec : background ] ) and @xmath17 ( which will make the snr equal when the dominant source of noise is poisson noise ) this yields @xmath18 .",

    "we consider separately two scientific cases : * charting * and * re - observing*.      we define charting as an observation of a part of the sky that is unknown to the resolution and depth in question . in this mode , since we have no prior knowledge of the position of every object , we need to obtain several sub - observations , allowing for each part of the sky to have a specific pattern of appearance ( fig .",
    "[ toyexample ] ) in order to recover the correct position of each source .",
    "when re - observing , we have a prior image of the relevant region of the sky .",
    "our observational goal in re - observing mode is to measure the flux from previously known objects , measuring variability or searching for new transients . in the re - observing mode",
    "we can calculate for each pixel on the image a - priory ( using our known mapping of the sky ) which areas on the focal plane contribute to the measured flux , allowing for a simple recovery algorithm . the number of sub - observations required and",
    "therefore also the efficiency depends on whether the scientific mission requires to measure * all * the objects in the field , or just as many of them as possible .",
    "those two cases are analyzed separately .",
    "the case where it suffices to measure only most of the objects should allow using a trivial recovery algorithm , and requires only @xmath31 sub - observations .",
    "the other case , where all objects in the field are important , is similar to the charting mode because different objects falling on the same detector area must be dealt with .",
    "this case is not addressed in this paper as we expect it to be rare .    with recent advances in the recording of a multi - wavelength static image of much of the sky ,",
    "e.g. , by surveys such as sdss @xcite ps1 @xcite and ptf ( @xcite , @xcite ) in the optical , galex @xcite in the uv and 2mass @xcite , ukidss @xcite and wise @xcite in the ir , the re - observing mode is likely to be the common mode ( see applications [ subsec : lucky imaging ] , [ subsec : fast photometry ] , [ subsec : searching for transients ] , [ subsec : planet search ] ) .",
    "the recovery algorithm is simple , but to present it , we first need to introduce some notations and construct the sets of regions of sky combined during each sub - observation .",
    "we use @xmath0 , @xmath4 , and @xmath2 as defined before .",
    "denote the set of sky regions combined during sub - observation @xmath32 by @xmath33 .",
    "denote the flux recorded in sub - observation @xmath34 at pixel location @xmath35 by @xmath36 $ ] and denote the flux arriving to pixel @xmath35 from region @xmath37 on the focal plane by @xmath38 $ ] .",

    "this allows us to choose in a special way the set of vectors such that there will be no ambiguity in the reconstruction algorithm .",

    "this demonstrates a possible ambiguity , even without considering observational errors .",
    "there could be more than one combination of fluxes that will generate the same observed vector .",
    "this problem is inherent because we have less measurements than free parameters we are trying to measure ( here we try to measure 3 free parameters , @xmath60,g_1[x],g_2[x]$ ] , but we have only 2 measurements , @xmath52,f_1[x]$ ] ) .",
    "this is where the sparsity assumption is necessary .",

    "we can not solve the ambiguity and we can not determine neither the locations nor the fluxes of the non - zero sources .",
    "we should therefore construct the sets @xmath33 carefully , preventing ambiguities when few sources are contributing non - zero flux to a pixel location .",
    "the most basic requirement on our sets is that if there is only one non - zero flux contributing to a location @xmath35 then the recovery is unique .",
    "from here we can immediately deduce a strict demand on the construction of the set @xmath66 : for every pair of different vectors , @xmath67 and for all pairs of real numbers @xmath68 the following should hold : @xmath69 this demand , implying @xmath70 and @xmath71 , defines the absolute lower bound for the number @xmath4 of sub - observations to chart @xmath0 regions of the focal - plane , which is @xmath72 .",
    "it is sub - optimal to recover only objects that do not overlap with other objects ( this limits the multiplexing number @xmath0 ( and therefore @xmath2 ) to be smaller than desired , leading to smaller region of the sky being observed ) .",
    "therefore we wish to construct our sets such that unique recovery is guaranteed also when two objects fall on the same detector area , ( and with high probability will be unique even when there are 3 or more objects falling on the same detector area ) . in the case of two objects , in a similar fashion , we have @xmath73 again , we choose the set @xmath66 to hold an analogue condition : for every quadruplet of different vectors , @xmath74 and for all quadruplets of real numbers @xmath75 the following should hold : @xmath76 in our simple example above , this condition does not hold , as @xmath77 this fact is the cause of the ambiguity in the recovery .",
    "when we consider the charting of weak sources , another source of confusion can be the noise ( of all kinds ) .",
    "if two regions of sky have close representing vectors , i.e @xmath78 is small , then it is easy to confuse flux coming from region @xmath34 with flux coming from region @xmath37 .",
    "this is because the recovery algorithm can use only sub - observations that contain only one of the regions @xmath79 to distinguish between sources coming from region @xmath34 and sources coming from region @xmath37 .",
    "the snr of one sub - observation is lower than the snr of the reconstructed observation , meaning that statistically significant sources on the reconstructed image might not be significant in one sub - observation .",
    "this means that weak ( yet statistically significant sources ) which are non - significant in a single sub - observation can be mistakenly misplaced to positions with a representing vector which is close to the representing vector of the correct position .",
    "therefore we prefer to choose the representing vectors such that the difference between every pair of vectors is non - zero in at least @xmath80 coordinates .",
    "@xmath81 , we will just remark that it can be done for a multiplexing of @xmath0 with @xmath82 if we want a robust recovery . in a slightly less robust case ,",
    "when in the above notation @xmath83 ( @xmath84 is introduced later and is a confidence parameter of the algorithm , this condition means that with high probability there is no confusion between @xmath85 and @xmath86 due to noise ) then we can use as little as @xmath87 sub - observations for full recovery . on our simple example",
    "above , the minimal set that satisfies condition and condition with @xmath88 is : @xmath89      a detailed description of the charting recovery algorithm can be found in section [ algorithm ] , here we show only a simplified conceptual version .",
    "the input of this algorithm is @xmath90 for every pixel position @xmath35 .",

    "this algorithm is the simplest recovery algorithm one could think of , yet it captures the essence of the algorithm presented in section [ algorithm ] , which is statistically more accurate .",
    "this simple algorithm does not treat the case @xmath99 .",
    "we note that using the information from neighboring pixels we can easily solve ambiguities rising from the case @xmath99 .",
    "the results of employing this algorithm ( without using data from neighboring pixels ) to real data from galex are shown in section  [ sec : simulations ] .",
    "to understand the behavior of the efficiency @xmath100 , we need to know the exposure time factor @xmath101 .",

    "there are many possible applications to the multiplexed imaging method , and many scientific missions operating in the visible , uv and ir ( from space ) can substantially increase their capabilities by using it .",
    "high multiplexing may be limited by the observed object density , or by practical / optical reasons . here",
    "we discuss the expected improvements assuming no optical limitations , which will surely arise when designing a multiplexed imaging system with a large number of optical elements .",
    "we assume that the object density ( @xmath23 ) can be as low as @xmath160 , and the expected improvement shown below assume this object density .",
    "multiplexed imaging would be powerful for sky surveys from space because of the combination of the following factors :    * detectors are more expensive to operate in space , and the multiplexed imaging system may reduce the amount of expensive space - qualified hardware . *",

    "the lucky imaging method is a technique used to decrease the effects of atmospheric aberrations using high frequency imaging @xcite . when imaging at high frequency , the dominant noise source is the read noise , meaning that high multiplexing might be useful .",
    "one should notice that the current charting recovery algorithm will not suffice for this approach , because objects that fall on the same detector area will interfere differently on each sub - observation , as a result of the atmospheric aberrations .",
    "therefore , we must assume that the logical limit set by the object density is lower than the bound we got from the object density , to prevent the interference of objects .",

    "astronomers use high frequency observations ( @xmath162 ) to search for rapid changes in the light flux coming from stars , e.g caused by random occultations by kuiper belt objects @xcite or by intrinsic changes of the stellar flux ( e.g , astro - seismology , @xcite ) . in this scientific use ,",
