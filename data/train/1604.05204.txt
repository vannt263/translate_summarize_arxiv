    "<S> we report on the temperature and layer thickness variation of spin - orbit torques in perpendicularly magnetized w / cofeb bilayers . </S>",
    "<S> harmonic hall voltage measurements reveal dissimilar temperature evolutions of longitudinal and transverse effective magnetic field components . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse effective field changes sign at 250 k for a 2 nm thick w buffer layer , indicating a much stronger contribution from interface spin - orbit interactions compared to , for example , ta . </S>",
    "<S> transmission electron microscopy measurements reveal that considerable interface mixing between w and cofeb is primarily responsible for this effect .    </S>",
    "<S> efficient manipulation of magnetization using electrical signals at the nanoscale will further the development of next generation magnetic memories , logic @xcite and microwave devices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spin hall effect@xcite and rashba effect@xcite are intensively studied , as they produce effective magnetic fields that can be used to switch the magnetization of magnetic nano - pillars @xcite , excite microwave oscillations in nano - discs @xcite or induce magnetic domain - wall motion in nanowires @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quantitatively , spin - orbit torques are characterized by the spin hall angle ( @xmath0 ) , which is a measure of the ratio between spin current density ( @xmath1 ) and charge current density ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> different heavy metal / ferromagnet bilayers have been proposed as the source of spin - orbit torque , including : ta @xcite , hf @xcite , pt @xcite , cuir @xcite , and w @xcite , with w exhibiting the largest @xmath0 to date . </S>",
    "<S> recent work on oxidized w has also revealed promising results @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> studies on symmetry of spin - orbit torques pointed out different contributions to the effective magnetic field arising from the bulk spin hall effect and interface rashba interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it has been shown that the interface between heavy metal and ferromagnetic layers strongly affects both @xmath0 @xcite and the spin diffusion length @xcite .    in this letter , we demonstrate that spin - orbit torques in w / cofeb bilayers are strongly affected by interface mixing . </S>",
    "<S> both transverse and longitudinal torque components are measured in a temperature range from 19 to 300 k. the interface contribution to the transverse effective field is dominant at low temperatures , leading to a sign reversal at 250 k , where the bulk spin - orbit torque starts to dominate . </S>",
    "<S> considerable mixing between w and cofeb is supported by transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) and x - ray reflectivity ( xrr ) analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> the investigated samples consisted of sputter - deposited multilayers with the following structure : w(@xmath3)/co@xmath4fe@xmath5b@xmath6(1.3)/mgo(2.5)/ta(4 ) ( thicknesses in nm ) , with @xmath3 = 2 , 4 , and 6 nm . after deposition , the samples were measured using vibrating sample magnetometry ( vsm ) , x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) and xrr and they were successively annealed in a high vacuum chamber . </S>",
    "<S> microstructure analysis was performed using a jeol 2200fs tem with double cs correctors , operated at 200 kev . </S>",
    "<S> cross - sectional tem specimens were prepared by a multiprep polishing machine ( allied high - tech ) and ar ion milling . </S>",
    "<S> selected samples were patterned using e - beam lithography , ion - beam etching and lift - off processes into 70 @xmath7 m long hall bars of different width spanning from 1 to 40 @xmath7 m . during microfabrication , electrical contacts with a dimensions of 100 @xmath8 100 @xmath7 m were deposited and most of the ta top layer was etched away leaving only a thin oxidized layer as protection .    </S>",
    "<S> the resistivity of the samples was measured using a four - probe method , both for as - deposited devices ( with in - plane magnetic anisotropy ) and annealed ones ( with effective perpendicular magnetic anisotropy - pma ) . </S>",
    "<S> the harmonic hall voltage measurements were carried out using lock - in amplification in a janis cryogenic probe station equipped with an electromagnet . during these experiments </S>",
    "<S> , the temperature was varied between 19 and 300 k. measurements were performed for various magnetic field orientations : perpendicular to the sample plane ( along @xmath9 axis - i.e. anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) configuration ) , longitudinal to the stripe ( along @xmath10 axis ) and transverse to the stripe ( along @xmath11 axis ) .    </S>",
    "<S> first , the crystallographic phases of w with different layer thicknesses ( @xmath3 = 2 , 4 , and 6 nm ) were determined using xrd measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath12 - 2@xmath12 scans of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : xrd_vsm](a ) reveal that the @xmath13-tungsten phase is present in all samples , whereas , a clear @xmath14-tungsten reflection is visible only for the sample with a 6 nm thick w layer . </S>",
    "<S> the same conclusion can be drawn from four - point resistivity measurements . assuming a cofeb resistivity of 113 @xmath15 cm ( measured independently ) and a parallel resistor model , the calculated w resistivity ( @xmath16 ) amounts 128 and 105 @xmath15 cm for @xmath3 = 2 nm and 4 nm , respectively , but it decreases significantly to 36 @xmath15 cm for @xmath3 = 6 nm , supporting the presence of a low - resistive @xmath14-tungsten phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also verified , that @xmath14-tungsten does not form in the thinner w layers during annealing ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : xrd_vsm](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> because the @xmath13-tungsten phase is crucial for obtaining pma and large spin hall angles @xcite , we focus on the thinner w buffers only . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the resistivity of w / cofeb bilayers did not change ( within experimental error ) upon annealing .    </S>",
    "<S> -2@xmath12 scans for as - deposited samples with different @xmath3 ( a ) and for annealed samples with @xmath3 = 4 nm ( b )  curves are offset for clarity . in - plane and perpendicular magnetization curves for the sample with @xmath3 = 4 nm after annealing at 250 @xmath17c ( c ) and 350 @xmath17c ( d ) . ]     </S>",

    "<S> inset presents ahe measured for @xmath3 = 4 nm measured at various temperatures . ]    independently , the magnetic properties of the deposited stacks were verified using vsm . </S>",
    "<S> exemplary magnetic hysteresis loops for @xmath3 = 4 nm are presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : xrd_vsm ] . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements indicate a transition from in - plane anisotropy to pma after annealing at 350 @xmath17c , which is consistent with our earlier work @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> next , the ahe of samples with @xmath3 = 2 and 4 nm were measured in perpendicular magnetic field ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ahe ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> although both w layers induce pma in cofeb , the switching for @xmath3 = 2 nm is more abrupt compared to @xmath3 = 4 nm . </S>",
    "<S> this effect , which can be attributed to more gradual magnetization rotation or magnetic domain formations@xcite , hampers the extraction of effective magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this behavior persist even at low temperatures ( inset in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ahe ] ) , ruling out superparamagnetism in 1.3 nm thick cofeb as its origin . because of abrupt magnetic switching , we limit our discussion to effective magnetic fields in w / cofeb bilayers with @xmath3 = 2 nm .     </S>",
    "<S> = 2 nm . </S>",
    "<S> note that the first harmonic hall voltage signal vs. transverse field is similar to ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> inset in ( c ) shows the harmonic hall voltage measurement configuration . ]    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : hall ] shows ahe and harmonic hall voltages at t = 19 k for the sample with @xmath3 = 2 nm . the first harmonic hall voltage signal measured in a magnetic field applied longitudinal to the hall bar ( @xmath18 ) exhibits a parabolic shape and was fitted using a quadratic function both for the remanent magnetization point along + @xmath9 and -@xmath9 directions . </S>",
    "<S> results for a magnetic field applied transverse to the long axis of the hall bar ( @xmath19 ) are almost identical . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , the second harmonic signal was fitted using a linear function for both remanent magnetic field orientations . in this case , the two fitted lines are either symmetric ( measurement along @xmath18 - fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : hall](c ) ) or asymmetric ( measurement along @xmath19 - fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : hall](d ) ) with respect to the magnetic field polarity . </S>",
    "<S> the model presented in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite was used to calculate the effective longitudinal @xmath20 and transverse @xmath21 magnetic fields :    @xmath22     and transverse @xmath21 fields as a function of temperature - left axis , measured for a 10-@xmath23-wide stripe with @xmath3 = 2 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the oersted field contribution was calculated from the current flowing through the buffer and subtracted from the transverse field . </S>",
    "<S> the right axis presents data of spin hall efficiency calculated using eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : efficiency ] . ]    using a parallel resistor model , we calculated the current density in the w buffer layer as @xmath2 = 2.17@xmath810@xmath24 a / m@xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 drops by about 3% at t = 19 k with respect to the room temperature value , as the resistance increases with decreasing temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this negative temperature coefficient is explained by the existence of an amorphous phase in the w buffer and will be discussed in detailed elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> the data presented here were measured in 10-@xmath7m - wide stripe , however , no significant dependence of the strip s width on the determined values of effective magnetic field were found . instead of @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , we characterized our bilayers using damping - like and field - like spin - orbit torque efficiencies ( @xmath26 and @xmath26 , respectively ) , as we independently measured these two torque components . </S>",
    "<S> the following equation was used to calculate the effective spin - orbit torques :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the reduced planck s constant , @xmath29 is the electron charge , @xmath30 is the saturation magnetization and @xmath31 is the effective thickness of cofeb : @xmath31 = 0.92 nm ( comparing to @xmath32 = 1.3 nm nominal thickness , without a magnetic dead layer taken into account ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the saturation magnetization of cofeb at room temperature equals @xmath33 = 1.6 t and it increases to 2 t at t = 19 k. figure [ fig : torque ] presents the effective magnetic fields and spin - orbit torque efficiencies vs. temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that a relatively large planar hall effect ( phe ) of maximum 30% of ahe value @xcite was measured in this sample . </S>",
    "<S> however , its magnitude vanishes when the magnetic field is aligned along the @xmath10 or @xmath11 directions , and therefore , we did not take it into account in the analysis of the effective magnetic fields .     </S>",
    "<S> is assumed ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the interface roughness does not change during annealing . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the result of @xmath26 are in agreement with spin hall angles derived in the literature data for w buffer layers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a slightly higher value is expected for thicker w , as @xmath3 = 2 nm used here is smaller than the spin diffusion length of w @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the longitudinal spin - orbit - torque is similar to ta @xcite . on the other hand , the transverse effective field changes sign at around 250 k , which is not the case for ta with the same thickness . </S>",
    "<S> similar behavior has only been measured for very thin ta , namely @xmath34 = 0.5 nm , which indicates a much stronger interface effect in w. generally , interface interactions ( for example the rashba effect ) are dominant for thin buffers , whereas , for thicker heavy metals stronger contributions from field - like spin torques originating in the bulk are expected . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude that in our case ( @xmath3 = 2 nm ) , both effects are of similar magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> this also implies , that the field - like spin - orbit torque opposes the interfacial interactions and that it varies more strongly with temperature . to elucidate the origin of the strong interface effect </S>",
    "<S> , tem analysis of the samples was performed . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : tem ] presents a z - contrast image . the chemical sensitivity of the high - angle scattered electron signal provides good contrast between the polycrystalline w buffer , cofeb / mgo bilayer and the ta film with a thin oxidized layer on top . </S>",
    "<S> the line scan in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tem](b ) shows a gradual change of z - contrast near the w / cofeb interface , providing proof of considerable intermixing between these two layers . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is further corroborated by the xrr measurements of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tem](c ) , which show that the w / cofeb interface is very rough ( @xmath35 = 0.57 nm ) , whereas a much smaller roughness is obtained for the cofeb / mgo interface ( @xmath36 = 0.18 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that @xmath35 is not affected by thermal annealing of the sample , i.e. , intermixing primarily occurs during film growth . </S>",
    "<S> strong intermixing between the w and cofeb layers , explains the large interface contribution ( for example via the rashba effect ) , to the total spin - orbit effective magnetic field in this study . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it can also explain high spin - orbit interactions in w / cofeb bilayer leading to strong planar and spin hall effects as well as anisotropic and spin - hall magnetoresistance @xcite .    in summary , we investigated spin - orbit torques in perpendicularly magnetized cofeb on thin w buffer layers . </S>",
    "<S> harmonic hall voltage measurements were used to determine longitudinal and transverse spin - orbit effective magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the damping - like spin - orbit torque component is found to slightly increase with decreasing temperature reaching @xmath26 = 0.27 at 19 k. in contrast , the field - like component , depends strongly on temperature and changes sign at 250 k. this temperature dependence indicates a strong interface contribution to the total spin - orbit torque ( rashba effect ) . from tem and xrr measurements , we conclude that the large interface effect originates from strong intermixing between the w and cofeb layers . </S>"
