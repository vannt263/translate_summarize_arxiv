    "in the last decade we have gained a deep understanding of the interplay between the topology of single complex networks @xcite and the behavior of critical phenomena occurring on them @xcite .",
    "recently , it has become clear that in order to fully investigate the properties of a large variety of complex systems such as energy supply networks @xcite , complex infrastructures @xcite , social networks @xcite , climatic systems @xcite and brain networks @xcite , it is necessary to consider their multilayer structure @xcite .",
    "each layer corresponds to a network with a specific function , but the entire complex system requires multiple layers operating in a coupled way and forming an interacting set of networks . for example , analyses of the disruptions provoked by an earthquake to large infrastructures show the relevance of interdependence among power transmission and telecommunications @xcite and the different resilience of coupled networks such as the power grid and the water system @xcite .",
    "an important and ubiquitous example of multilayer networks is a multiplex where the same nodes are linked by different networks ( layers ) .",
    "a multiplex is formed by a set of @xmath0 nodes and @xmath1 layers .",
    "every node is represented in every layer , and every layer is formed by a network of interactions ( links ) between the nodes .",
    "for instance , multiplexes are good descriptions of social networks , where the nodes represent agents and the different layers correspond either to different types of interaction ( such as family , work or friendship ties)@xcite or to different means of communication ( email , chat , mobile phone , etc .  ) @xcite .",
    "other examples of multiplexes can be found in transportation networks , where cities can be connected by roads , railways , waterways or airline connections @xcite , or brain networks where different regions of the brain belong at the same time to the functional network of brain activity and to the structural brain network @xcite .    in the last years ,",
    "interest on multiplexes has been growing both on the theoretical side , and on the empirical side of multiplex data analysis .",
    "in fact different models of multiplex structure have been formulated @xcite , critical phenomena and dynamical processes have been characterized on multiplex structures @xcite , and finally new structural measures have been introduced and evaluated in large multiplex datasets @xcite .",
    "the theoretical interest has been partly sparked by the discovery @xcite that the robustness properties of a multiplex formed by interdependent networks is strongly affected by its multilayer structure .",
    "in fact a multiplex can be much more fragile than single networks and its functionality can be affected significantly by cascades of node failures @xcite . in this context , the mutually connected giant component ( mcgc ) plays a pivotal role .",
    "the mcgc of a multiplex is the extensive component where every pair of nodes is connected in every layer by at least one path formed by nodes inside the mcgc .",
    "if a fraction @xmath2 of nodes is removed from a multiplex with a mcgc , the size of the mcgc is reduced . at some value of @xmath3",
    ", a critical point is reached where a first order hybrid transition is observed and the mcgc abruptly drops from a finite value to zero @xcite .    despite the interesting theoretical behavior , analysis of the empirical side offers another observation not yet addressed by the theory , which is that many multiplexes @xcite are formed by correlated networks characterized by a significant overlap of the links .",
    "for example , in social networks it is common for two friends to communicate both via email and via mobile phone , or in transportation networks two cities connected by a main road are likely to be connected also by a railway .",
    "given such empirical findings , the theory of multiplex networks can not be complete until the effects of link overlap in the multiplex robustness properties ( characterized by the mcgc ) are understood .",
    "our aim is not to address a specific application , but give instead a general theoretical approach that can include edge overlap in the study of percolation under random damage .",
    "percolation is perhaps the simplest model of robustness and stability , but it constitutes a first step in dealing with more complex models and even dynamical processes occurring on the network . therefore , introducing a formalism with edge overlap in percolation on multiplex networks should be seen as an important building block of the science of complex networks .    in this paper",
    ", we apply this formalism to the case of 2 and 3-layer poisson graphs and calculate the phase diagrams of the models .",
    "we show that edge overlap can significantly enhance the robustness properties of the multiplex .",
    "we also show that a multiplex formed by more than two layers presents a very rich phase diagram with high order critical points , characterizing the increased complexity of this percolation problem .    in section ii",
    "we introduce the notation of multiplexes with edge overlap , in section iii we formulate a general framework to characterize the emergence of the mcgc , in section iv we calculate the phase diagrams of percolation on 2 and 3-layer poisson graphs and in section v we draw the conclusion of this work .",
    "consider a multiplex formed by @xmath0 labelled nodes @xmath4 and @xmath1 layers .",
    "we can represent the multiplex as described in @xcite . to this end",
    "we indicate by @xmath5 the set of all the networks @xmath6 at layer @xmath7 forming the multiplex .",
    "each of these networks has an adjacency matrix with matrix elements @xmath8 if there is a link between node @xmath9 and node @xmath10 in layer @xmath11 and zero otherwise .    a useful concept to characterize multiplex structure are _ multilinks _ , and _ multidegrees _ recently defined in @xcite",
    "let us consider the vector @xmath12 in which every element @xmath13 can take only two values @xmath14 .",
    "we define a _ multilink _ , and we represent it with @xmath15 , as the set of links connecting a given pair of nodes in the different layers of the multiplex and connecting them in the generic layer @xmath11 only if @xmath16 .",
    "multilinks are mutually exclusive , i.e. any pair of nodes @xmath17 can be linked only by one multilink @xmath15 , that we call @xmath18 . in figure @xmath19",
    "we show an example of a multiplex where nodes @xmath17 are linked by a multilink @xmath20 and nodes @xmath21 are linked by a multilink @xmath22 .",
    "are linked by a multilink @xmath23 , the nodes @xmath21 are linked by a multilink @xmath24 , all the other pairs of nodes are linked by a multilink @xmath25 . ]",
    "note how the introduction of the multilink now makes explicit the notion of overlap of the links : the links @xmath17 in the layers @xmath26 overlap if the nodes @xmath9 and @xmath10 are joined by a multilink @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "for a multiplex it is possible to define a set of multiadjacency matrices of elements by setting @xmath29 if node @xmath9 is linked to node @xmath10 by a multilink @xmath15 and @xmath30 otherwise .",
    "in other words , every element @xmath31 not only depends on the node pair @xmath17 as in classical adjacency matrices , but it is also a function of the generic multilink @xmath32 . these multiadjacency matrices can be defined in terms of the adjacency matrices @xmath33 on each layer @xmath11 , for each @xmath34 , a_ij^=_=1^m .",
    "the expression in the square brackets ( in an unweighted network ) can only be zero or one .",
    "it equals one only when the components of @xmath32 match the actual presence of an @xmath17 link on the layer @xmath11 .",
    "otherwise , the expression is zero and correctly represents the absence of a multilink of given type @xmath32 between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the number of multilinks is @xmath35 but the elements of the multiadjacency matrices are not all independent .",
    "in fact they satisfy the relation _",
    "\\{0,1}^ma_ij^=1 , [ norm ] where the sum is over the set of all possible multilinks . since the elements of the multiadjacency matrices @xmath31 are either zero or one , the condition given by eq.@xmath36 implies that between any pair of nodes @xmath17 there is a single multilink that we indicate with @xmath18 .",
    "therefore only @xmath37 adjacency matrices are independent . in most multiplex networks the number of layers is finite , therefore the exponential number of multilinks is not an important limitation to this approach .",
    "moreover , our framework can be easily generalized to the case of multiplexes with a large number of layers @xmath1 in which only few types of multilinks are allowed .",
    "finally , we define the _ multidegree _ with respect to @xmath15 of a node @xmath9 , @xmath38 , as the total number of multilinks @xmath15 connected to node @xmath9 , i.e. k_i^=_j=1^n a_ij^. in the specific case of a duplex ( @xmath39 ) we have @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the local overlap of node @xmath9 , i.e. the total number of nodes @xmath10 linked to node @xmath9 both in layer 1 and in layer 2 . in general , for a multiplex of @xmath1 layers the multidegree @xmath42 can be considered as a high order measure of local overlap as long as @xmath43 .",
    "this framework encapsulates two particular cases , which are already known to the scientific community .",
    "first , let us consider the case of fully overlapping multiplexes , where all links are the same in all layers . in this case , we recover classical percolation with a continuous second order phase transition .",
    "second , we may consider the case where edges on different layers are totally uncorrelated . as we are considering configuration model graphs on each layer ,",
    "the multiplex consists of a random coupling of locally tree - like , sparse random graphs @xcite .",
    "therefore , the probability of edge overlap vanishes as @xmath44 .",
    "it has been recently shown that in this case the phase transition is discontinuous @xcite .",
    "in general , instead , one needs to consider overlap effects when designing or studying the fragility of multiplexes .",
    "our formalism , and in particular the concept of multilink , can be very helpful , giving us a fully controllable tool to study the problem .",
    "as we mention in the introduction , the mcgc of a multiplex is the extensive component where every pair of nodes is connected in every layer by at least one path formed by nodes inside the mcgc .",
    "then , we can consider the behavior of the size of the mcgc in a multiplex as a fraction @xmath2 of nodes is removed . if there is no link overlap , at a critical value of @xmath3 , a first order hybrid transition is observed and the mcgc abruptly drops from a finite value to zero @xcite .",
    "our goal is to characterize the effect of link overlap on how the mutually connected giant component ( mcgc ) changes as a function of @xmath3 ( the fraction of remaining nodes ) .",
    "specifically , we will follow and extend the approach developed by son @xcite for studying the percolation on two interdependent networks without overlap .",
    "first of all , we observe that a node @xmath9 belongs to the mutually connected giant component of the multiplex networks if and only if the following @xmath1 conditions are met simultaneously : for every layer @xmath7 _ at least one of the neighbor nodes of @xmath9 in network @xmath11 belongs to the mutually connected giant component of the interdependent networks_. we consider a tree - like multiplex , a multiplex in which the combined network of all the layers ( the network of adjacency matrix @xmath45 , where @xmath46 if @xmath47 otherwise @xmath48 ) is locally tree - like . according to the above recursive definition of the mcgc , on a locally tree - like multiplex we can determine if a node belongs to the mcgc by a message - passing algorithm @xcite , described in son as an `` epidemic spreading '' process @xcite .",
    "let @xmath49 indicate if a node is removed or not from the network and let @xmath50 be the indicator function that the node @xmath9 is in the mutually connected giant component .",
    "the value of @xmath51 is determined by the  messages \" that the neighboring nodes send to node @xmath9 .",
    "we denote these  messages \" as @xmath52 .",
    "the value of the message is set to one @xmath53 if and only if the following two conditions are satisfied :    * node @xmath10 is a neighbor of node @xmath9 with a multilink @xmath18 connecting them such that @xmath54 ; * node @xmath10 belongs to the mutually connected giant component even if the multilink @xmath18 between node @xmath10 and node @xmath9 is removed from the multiplex .",
    "otherwise we will have @xmath55 .    in a locally tree - like multiplex the value of @xmath51 and",
    "@xmath52 satisfy the following message - passing relations @xmath56 ,      \\label{sigma-1}\\ ] ] @xmath57 ,      \\label{sigma - ijm-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 indicates the set of nodes that are neighbor of node @xmath9 in layer @xmath11 .",
    "the expression within square brackets in eq .",
    "( [ sigma-1 ] ) is one only if on layer @xmath11 at least one of the neighbors @xmath10 of node @xmath9 is connected to the mcgc by an edge other than the @xmath17 edge , otherwise is zero .",
    "equation ( [ sigma - ijm-1 ] ) has been written using the same logic , but taking now into consideration that @xmath10 is required to be in the mcgc by connecting to a neighbor @xmath59 which must be different from @xmath9 .",
    "this is calculated by subtracting from one the probability that all the neighbors @xmath10 of @xmath9 are not attached to the mcgc .",
    "let us now consider equation ( [ sigma - ijm-1 ] ) , by using the formula @xmath60 where @xmath61 with @xmath62 , and where the sum @xmath63 is over all possible vectors @xmath64 .",
    "we can expand the multiplications and write @xmath65 by observing that for each node @xmath59 neighboring node @xmath10 in layer @xmath11 we should necessarily have @xmath66 and that @xmath67 , it is possible to swap the two products in equation ( [ sigma - ijm-2 ] ) and show that @xmath68 similarly , we can show that @xmath69    let us now consider a multiplex belonging to the multiplex ensemble @xcite characterized by a given multidegree distribution and no degree - degree ( multidegree - multidegree ) correlations .",
    "we can construct a network in this ensemble by extending the configuration model to networks with multidegrees .",
    "to this end , we draw the multidegree sequence @xmath70 from a multidegree distribution @xmath71 .",
    "we then attach @xmath38 stubs of type @xmath15 such that @xmath43 to each node @xmath9 .",
    "finally we randomly match the stubs of the same type of multilinks belonging to different nodes . in this ensemble the probability @xmath72 of a multiplex @xmath73 is given by p()=_ij_()^a_ij^^a_ij^ where we have assumed that the multidegrees @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and we have indicated with @xmath76 the average of the multidegrees @xmath15 present in the network .",
    "the condition on the multidegrees imposes a  multidegree structural cutoff \" that ensure the fact that in the multiplex the multidegrees of linked nodes are not correlated .",
    "we assume that the nodes are removed with probability @xmath77 , and that therefore the sequence @xmath78 indicating if the node @xmath9 is removed ( @xmath79 ) or not ( @xmath80 ) has probability p(\\{s_i})=_i=1^n .",
    "we define @xmath81 the probability that following a multilink @xmath82 ( with @xmath83 ) we reach a node in the mcgc in a multiplex in this ensemble . since @xmath84 the probability @xmath81 that a random message in the multiplex is equal to one , i.e. @xmath85 is equal to the average s_&= & [ snp1 ] where @xmath86 if @xmath87 and @xmath88 otherwise , and where we use the notation & = + & = _ p()_\\{s_i}p(\\{s_i})_i , j . for any function @xmath89 .",
