    "one such a [ computationally justified ] approach for studying complex dynamics capitalizes on the concept of sensitivity of deterministic chaos .",
    "sensitivity of chaotic trajectories can be quantified in terms of the divergence rate evaluated through the largest lyapunov characteristic exponent .",
    "the approach has been proven to work exceptionally well for various systems with chaotic and simple dynamics .",
    "in several low - order dissipative systems , like the rssler model , the computational technique based on the largest lyapunov characteristic exponent reveals that they possess common , easily recognizable patterns involving spiral structures in bi - parametric planes @xcite .",
    "such patterns turn out to be ubiquitously alike in both time - discrete @xcite and time - continuous systems @xcite , and they are easily located when the spiral patterns have regular and chaotic spiral `` arms '' in the systems with the shilnikov saddle - focus @xcite .",
    "application of the lyapunov exponents technique fails , in general , to reveal fine structures embedded in the bi - parametric scans of lorenz - like systems . as such it can not deliver the desired insights into intrinsic bifurcations because regions of chaotic dynamics appear to be uniformly",
    "this basically means that the instability of the lorenz attractors does not vary noticeably as control parameters of the system are varied .",
    "this holds true too when one attempts to find the presence of characteristic spiral structures that are known to exist theoretically in the lorenz - like systems @xcite and therefore could only be identified using accurate bifurcation continuation approaches @xcite .",

    "it follows from the theoretical analysis that the unfolding of this bifurcation includes three main curves ending at the t - point : a spiraling bifurcation curve , ( 1-hom @xmath1 ) corresponding to two simultaneous ( due to the symmetry ) homoclinic loops of the saddle , a curve , ( 1-hom @xmath2 ) , corresponding to two simultaneous homoclinic loops of the saddle - foci , and another codimension - one bifurcation curve , ( 1-het @xmath2 ) , corresponding to a heteroclinic correction between both saddle - foci .",

    "it is our intention to enhance further the technique thus allowing for systematic studies of the stunning complexity and universality of spiral structures in models of diverse dynamics and origins .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec:2 ] we review the homoclinic bifurcation theory and discuss the routes to chaos and the formation stages of the strange attractor in the lorenz model ; in section [ sec:3 ] we introduce basics of kneading theory ; in section [ sec:4 ] we demonstrate of the computational technique using kneading invariants to reveal hidden structures of biparametric chaos in the iconic lorenz model ; in section [ sec:5 ] we apply the technique to uncover colorfulness of the bifurcation diagrams of the shimizu - morioka model .",
    "finally , in section [ sec:6 ] the proposed technique will be tested on a 6d model of the optically pumped , far infrared red three - level laser @xcite to confirm the universality of the patters produced by the deterministic chaos in the lorenz like systems .",

    "the equilibrium states become saddle - foci of the ( 1,2)-type through a subcritical andronov - hopf bifurcation @xcite .",
    "the topological ( 1,2)-type means that each saddle - focus has 2d unstable and 1d stable manifolds ; the latter is formed by two incoming separatrices . some local properties of the saddle - foci can be revealed without evaluating their characteristic exponents explicitly .",
    "let @xmath55 stand for the real stable exponent of @xmath2 , and @xmath56 stand for a complex conjugate pair such that @xmath57 .",

    "this implies @xmath60 , i.e. , the complex conjugate pair is closer to the imaginary axis than the real negative exponent , and hence the saddle - foci meet the shilnikov condition @xcite .",
    "therefore , as soon as the saddle - focus possesses a homoclinic loop , such a bifurcation causes the abundance of periodic orbits nearby .",
    "those periodic orbits constantly undergo saddle - node and period doubling bifurcations as the parameters are varied . moreover , since the divergence of the vector field of the lorenz equation is always negative , saddle - node bifurcations give rise to stable periodic orbits near the homoclinic saddle - focus bifurcation . under fulfillment of some global conditions",
    ", a single shilnikov saddle - focus bifurcation can lead to the formation of a spiral or screw - like attractor .",
    "however , a strange attractor due to the shilnikov saddle - focus in a 3d system with a negative divergence is no genuinely chaotic set in the sense that it contains stable periodic orbits within .",
    "because of that , such a chaotic attractor is called quasi - attractor thus referring to that because besides stable periodic orbits with weak basins it may have structurally unstable or non - transverse homoclinic orbits @xcite .",
    "note that systems in higher dimensions can possess genuinely strange attractors with the shilnikov loop without stable periodic orbits , the so - called wild chaotic attractors @xcite .    .",

    "( b ) a typical time evolution of the @xmath62-coordinate of the right separatrix of the saddle . ]    the lorenz attractor is non - hyperbolic because it includes the singularity at the origin  the saddle equilibrium state with an 1d unstable manifold while all other saddle periodic orbits on the attractor have 2d stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "moreover , the manifolds of those orbits in the lorenz attractor ( self ) cross transversally in the 3d phase space thereby producing only structurally stable ( transverse ) homoclinic and heteroclinic trajectories .",
    "this condition imperative for the lorenz attractor will not always hold for larger parameter values and lead to homoclinic tangencies of the manifolds which are followed by saddle - node bifurcations in the newhouse regions @xcite of the parameter plane of the system .",
    "thus , in order for the lorenz attractor to be strange and chaotic with no stable orbits , it must not include the [ homoclinic ] saddle - foci , @xmath2 , as well as contain only structurally stable homoclinic orbits due to transverse intersections of the manifolds of saddle periodic orbits .",
    "chaos can be quantified by several means .",
    "one customary way is through the evaluation of the topological entropy .",
    "the greater the value of topological entropy , the more developed and unpredictable the chaotic dynamics become .",
    "another practical approach for measuring chaos in simulations capitalizes on evaluations of the largest ( positive ) lyapunov exponent of a long yet finite - time transient on the chaotic attractor .",
    "after the stable foci have lost the stability through the subcritical andronov - hopf bifurcation , the lorenz equation exhibits the strange attractor of the iconic butterfly shape .",
    "the wings of the butterfly are marked with two symmetric eyes containing the saddle - foci isolated from the trajectories of the lorenz attractor .",
    "this attractor is structurally unstable @xcite as it undergoes bifurcations constantly as the parameters of the lorenz equation are varied .",
    "the primary cause of structural and dynamical instability of chaos in the lorenz equation and similar models is the singularity at the origin ",
    "the saddle with two one - dimensional outgoing separatrices .",
    "both separatrices fill in densely two spatially symmetric , [ @xmath7 ] , wings of the lorenz attractor in the 3d phase space ( see fig .  [ fig1l ] ) .",
    "the lorenz attractor undergoes a homoclinic bifurcation when the separatrices of the saddle change the flip - flop pattern of switching between the butterfly wings centered around the saddle - foci . at such a change , the separatrices comes back to the saddle thereby causing additional homoclinic explosions in phase space @xcite .",
    "the time progression of the  right \" ( or symmetrical  left \" ) separatrix of the origin can be described geometrically and categorized in terms of the number of flip - flops around the equilibrium states @xmath64 and @xmath65 in the 3d phase space of the lorenz equation ( fig .",
    "[ fig1l ] ) . or , alternatively , can be reduced to the time - evolution of the @xmath62-coordinate of the separatrix , as shown in panel  b of fig .",
    "[ fig1l ] .",
    "the sign - alternation of the @xmath62-coordinate suggests the introduction of a @xmath61-based alphabet to be employed for the symbolic description of the separatrix .",
    "namely , whenever the right separatrix turns around @xmath19 or @xmath20 , we write down @xmath66 or @xmath67 , respectively . for example , the time series shown in panel  b generates the following kneading sequence starting with @xmath68 etc .       in what follows",
    "we will introduce and demonstrate a new computational toolkit for the analysis of chaos in the lorenz - like models .",
    "the toolkit is inspired by the idea of kneading invariants introduced in @xcite .",
    "a kneading invariant is a quantity that is intended to uniquely describe the complex dynamics of the system that admit a symbolic description using two symbols , here @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the kneading invariant is supposed to depend monotonically on the governing parameter so that any two systems can be compared and differentiated , or equivalently , ordered in terms of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , by the kneadings .",
    "two systems with the lorenz attractors are topologically conjugate when they share the same kneading invariant , see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "moreover , for the lorenz - like systems , the topological entropy can be evaluated though the kneading invariants by reducing consideration to piecewise monotone mappings of a closed interval @xcite .",
    "such mappings are closely related to the geometric models of the lorenz attractor which are 1d and 2d poincar return mappings defined on some cross - section transverse to trajectories of the lorenz attractor .",
    "the basic idea behind either geometric model capitalizes on extended properties of the local poincar mapping near a homoclinic butterfly of the saddle @xcite .",
    "the mapping is assumed to meet a few other conditions related to the global properties of the flow far from the homoclinic butterfly .",
    "such a 1d constrained mapping shown in fig .",
    "[ 1dmapping](a ) can be written as : @xmath71 here @xmath72 is the saddle index , @xmath73 controls the distance between the returning separatrices , @xmath74 , and the saddle , and @xmath47 is a scalar whose sign determines whether the homoclinic loops at @xmath75 are oriented if @xmath76 , or twisted when @xmath77 , see @xcite for more details .    loosely speaking ,",
    "this geometric model ( [ map ] ) should have no critical point on both branches , and moreover possess a property of strong stretching with a rate of expansion more than @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "this would guarantee that the lorenz attractor will be densely filled in by the forward iterates of the separatrices , @xmath79 with no holes  lacunas containing isolated periodic orbits inside , stable or not .",
    "strong stretching would also imply a monotone dependence of the kneading invariants on a governing parameter .    in a symmetric system with the lorenz attractor",
    ", the kneading invariant is assigned to quantify the symbolic description of either separatrix ; in the asymmetric case one should consider two kneading invariants for both separatrices of the saddle .",
    "thus , in respect it reflects quantitatively a qualitative change in the separatrix behavior , such as flip - flopping patterns , as the parameter of the system is changed .    by construction , kneading invariants",
    "are proposed to serve as moduli of the topological equivalence that are employed to compare or contrast between any two lorenz attractors or , equivalently , any two lorenz - like systems . due to the symmetry of the lorenz mapping @xmath80 from eq .",
    "( [ map ] ) , forward iterates of the right separatrix , @xmath81 , of the discontinuity point ( resp .",

    "the condition @xmath86 is interpreted as a homoclinic loop , i.e. the separatrix returns to the origin after @xmath85 steps .",
    "the kneading invariant for the separatrix is defined in the form of a formal power series : @xmath87 setting @xmath88 make the series  ( [ fs ] ) convergent .",
    "the smallest zero , @xmath89 , if any , of the graph of ( [ fs ] ) in the interval @xmath88 yields the topological entropy , @xmath90 , of the 1d mapping  ( [ map ] ) .",
    "let us next draw a parallelism between the geometric model and the lorenz equation : the kneading sequence @xmath91 comprised of only @xmath66s of the mapping  ( [ map ] ) corresponds to the right separatrix converging to the stable equilibrium state , @xmath19 ( or possibly , a periodic orbit with @xmath92 ) .",
    "the corresponding kneading invariant is maximized at @xmath93 .",
    "when the right separatrix converges to an @xmath94-limit set with @xmath95 , like the left stable focus , @xmath65 then the kneading invariant is given by @xmath96 because the first entry @xmath66 in the kneading sequence is followed by infinite @xmath67s .",

    ", we employ a rough idea for defining the kneading sequences of @xmath66s and @xmath67s that relies on whether the right separatrix of the saddle makes a revolution around the right equilibrium state , @xmath19 , or the left one , @xmath20 , respectively , in the ( @xmath103)-projection of the 3d phase space .",
    "one can utilize even a simpler approach where the sign of the current kneading entry in the sequence is determined by the sign of the @xmath62-coordinate of the separatrix at the off - lying turning points , @xmath104 ( on the butterfly wings ) , given by @xmath105 , see the trace in fig .",
    "[ fig1l](b ) .",
    "there are other alternative ways for defining kneading entries , involving cross - sections , @xmath106 etc , that are not free of certain limitations either . in the future",
    "we plan to enhance the current kneading algorithms by utilizing the incoming 1d separatrices of the saddle - foci and finding the winding numbers around them instead .    in this computational study of the lorenz equation and two other models below , we consider partial kneading power series truncated after the first 50 entries : @xmath107 .",
    "the choice of the number of entries is not motivated by numerical precision , but by simplicity , as well as by a resolution of the bitmap mappings for the bi - parametric scans of the models .",
    "one has also to figure the proper value of @xmath108 : setting it too small makes the convergence fast so that the tail of the series has a little significance and hence does not differentiate the fine dynamics of the lorenz equation on longer time scales .    at the first stage of the routine",
    ", we perform a bi - parametric scan of the lorenz equation within a specific range in the @xmath109-plane .",

    "are dominated by simple attractors such as stable equilibria or stable periodic orbits to which the separatrix converge .",
    "a quick examination of the kneading definition ( [ fs ] ) reveals that the kneading invariant does not vary at a supercritical andronov - hopf bifurcation and a pitch - fork bifurcation describing continuous transitioning between stable symmetric and asymmetric periodic orbits .",
    "this holds true for a period - doubling bifurcation too , because the kneading sequence , say @xmath120 , inherits the same block repeated twice @xmath121 in the code for the periodic orbit of a double period and so forth .",
    "while the kneading technique does not detect such safe bifurcation boundaries @xcite having crossed through which the phase point does not run far from an old attractor to a new one , though it detects dangerous boundaries well , including a generic saddle - node bifurcation , homoclinic bifurcations , and some other .",
    "a borderline between two solid - color regions corresponds to a bifurcation through a dangerous boundary which is associated with a jump between the values of the kneading invariant .",
