    "optical tomography ( ot ) and electrical impedance tomography ( eit ) are medical imaging techniques that utilize the large contrast between the optical and electrical response of certain unhealthy tissues and that of healthy tissues . however , because ot and eit are modeled by diffusion operators that are highly smoothing , the reconstructions are typically very low resolution @xcite .",
    "several recent imaging techniques aim to combine the high contrast in ot and eit with a high resolution modality , for instance based on magnetic resonances ( mreit ) @xcite or , for what is of interest for us here , ultrasound .",
    "there are several ways of combining eit and ot with ultrasound .",
    "one way is to use the photo - acoustic or the electro - acoustic effects ; see , e.g. , @xcite . in this paper , we consider another way based on ultrasound modulation .    in the setting of eit , ultrasound modulated electrical impedance tomography ( umeit )",
    "is also called acousto - electric tomography ; see @xcite . in the setting of optical tomography , ultrasound",
    "modulated tomography ( umot ) is also called acousto - optic tomography . a model has been derived in @xcite in the so - called incoherent regime of wave propagation , while the coherent regime is addressed in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the inverse problem of umeit may be described as follows .",
    "the electric potential @xmath0 solves a diffusion equation ( see below ) with unknown conductivity @xmath1 .",
    "the ultrasound modulation whose modeling is recalled in section provides access to the power density @xmath2 for all @xmath3 inside the domain of interest .",
    "reconstruction of @xmath1 from this one internal functional @xmath4 is typically not feasible unless additional constraints are imposed ; see e.g. , @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we assume that several such power densities corresponding to , e.g. , different boundary conditions in are known . by polarization or direct measurements as shown in section [ sec : derivation ] , we can have access to @xmath5 for @xmath6 and @xmath7 solutions to the same elliptic equation with different boundary conditions .",
    "the case of the spatial dimension @xmath8 was treated in @xcite .",
    "this paper aims to generalize these results to the case @xmath9 ( which also generalize to the case @xmath10 , see @xcite , although we shall not present the details here ) and to show that umeit is a stable inverse problem , in the sense that in an appropriate norm , errors on the measurement of the power densities @xmath11 result in errors on the reconstruction of @xmath1 that are of the same order .",
    "this should be contrasted with the case of eit and ot , where the error on @xmath1 is roughly proportional to the logarithm of ( and hence much larger than ) the error on the available ( cauchy ) data . moreover ,",
    "our derivation is constructive in the sense that it produces an explicit procedure to reconstruct @xmath1 from knowledge of a sufficiently large number of internal measurements of the form @xmath11 .    in dimension @xmath8 ,",
    "one set of measurements for @xmath12 is sufficient to uniquely characterize @xmath1 . in dimension @xmath9 ,",
    "sets of measurements @xmath13 are sufficient locally but not necessarily globally .",
    "we show the existence of sets of measurements @xmath14 , which uniquely ( and stably ) characterize @xmath1 . this construction is based on showing that the determinant of a matrix whose columns are the gradients of three of the four solutions to the elliptic equation is always positive at any point @xmath3 of the domain .",
    "the three chosen solutions depend on the point @xmath3 .",
    "such constructions are based on the use of complex geometric optics solutions , which are a convenient tool to show that solutions to elliptic equations satisfy desired qualitative properties @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the derivation of the power density measurements from ultrasound modulations of media of interest is recalled in section [ sec : derivation ] .",
    "the main results obtained in this paper are presented in section [ sec : main ] .",
    "the proofs of the main theorems are given in the following two sections .",
    "section [ sec : local ] provides the proof of uniqueness , stability , and reconstruction procedures on a domain @xmath15 on which the determinant of a matrix composed of @xmath16 gradients of solutions is shown to be bounded below by a positive constant .",
    "how such results can be patched together to provide global reconstruction results is given in section [ sec : global ] . that determinants can be shown to have a prescribed sign is based on the use of complex geometric optics ( cgo ) solutions that are presented in section [ sec : global ] .",
    "we consider the following elliptic equation @xmath17 here , @xmath1 is the unknown diffusion coefficient , which we assume in this paper is a real - valued , scalar , function defined on a simply connected domain @xmath18 for @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that @xmath1 is bounded above and below by positive constants so that the above equation admits a unique solution .",
    "we also assume that @xmath1 is sufficiently smooth so that the solution to the above equation is continuously differentiable on @xmath19 , the closure of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath21 the boundary of @xmath20 and by @xmath22 the imposed ( sufficiently smooth ) dirichlet boundary conditions . the coefficient @xmath23 may model the electrical conductivity in the setting of electrical impedance tomography ( eit ) or a diffusion coefficient of particles ( photons ) in the setting of optical tomography ( ot ) .",
    "both eit and ot are modalities with high contrast , in the sense that @xmath23 takes different values in different tissues and allows one to discriminate between healthy and non - healthy tissues . in ot ,",
    "high contrasts are mostly observed in the absorption coefficient , which is not modeled here @xcite .    a methodology to couple high contrast with high resolution consists of perturbing the diffusion coefficient acoustically .",
    "let an acoustic signal propagate through the domain . in this presentation",
    ", we assume that the sound speed is constant and that the acoustic signal is a plane wave of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the amplitude of the acoustic signal , @xmath26 its wave - number and @xmath27 an additional phase . the acoustic signal modifies the properties of the diffusion equation .",
    "we assume that such an effect is small and that the coefficient in is modified as @xmath28 where we have defined @xmath29 and where @xmath30 is the product of the acoustic amplitude @xmath31 and a measure @xmath32 of the coupling between the acoustic signal and the modulations of the constitutive parameter in , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "we assume that @xmath33 so that the influence of the acoustic signal on @xmath34 admits an asymptotic expansion that we truncated at the second order as displayed in .",
    "the size of the terms in the expansion are physically characterized by @xmath35 and depend on the specific application .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath36 be solutions of with fixed boundary conditions @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "when the acoustic field is turned on , the coefficients are modified as described in and we denote by @xmath39 and @xmath40 the corresponding solutions .",
    "note that @xmath41 is the solution obtained by changing the sign of @xmath25 or equivalently by replacing @xmath27 by @xmath42 .    by the standard continuity of the solution to with respect to changes in the coefficients and regular perturbation arguments",
    ", we find that @xmath43 .",
    "let us multiply the equation for @xmath39 by @xmath44 and the equation for @xmath44 by @xmath39 , subtract the resulting equalities , and use standard integrations by parts .",
    "we obtain that @xmath45 here , @xmath46 is the standard surface measure on @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that @xmath47 and @xmath48 are measured on @xmath21 , at least on the support of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively , for all values @xmath51 of interest .",
    "note that the above equation holds if the dirichlet boundary conditions are replaced by neumann boundary conditions .",
    "let us define @xmath52 we assume that the real valued functions @xmath53 are known ( measured functions ) .",
    "notice that such knowledge is based on the physical boundary measurement of the cauchy data of the form @xmath54 and @xmath55 on @xmath21 .    equating like powers of @xmath51",
    ", we find that at leading order @xmath56 \\cos(k\\cdot x+\\varphi ) dx = j_1(k,\\varphi).\\ ] ] this may be acquired for all @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and hence provides the fourier transform of @xmath59(x ) = \\zeta \\sigma(x ) \\nabla u_0\\cdot\\nabla v_0(x).\\ ] ]    note that when @xmath60 , then we find from the expression in that @xmath61 in so that the expression for @xmath62 may be obtained from available measurements in with an accuracy of order @xmath63 .",
    "note also that @xmath64(x ) = \\dfrac14\\big(h[u_0+v_0,u_0+v_0]-h[u_0-v_0,u_0-v_0]\\big)\\ ] ] by polarization .",
    "in other words , the limiting measurements ( for small @xmath51 ) in may also be obtained by considering expressions of the form @xmath65 with @xmath66 .    in the setting of optical tomography ,",
    "the coefficient @xmath34 in takes the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath69 is the light speed , and @xmath16 is spatial dimension .",
    "when the pressure field is turned on , the location of the scatterers is modified by compression and dilation . since the diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to the scattering coefficient , we find that @xmath70 moreover , the pressure field changes the index of refraction ( the speed ) of light as follows @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a constant ( roughly equal to @xmath73 for water ) .",
    "this shows that @xmath74 in the setting of electrical impedance tomography , we simply assume that @xmath35 models the coupling between the acoustic signal and the change in the electrical conductivity of the underlying material .",
    "the value of @xmath35 thus depends on the application .",
    "the objective of ultrasound modulated optical tomography ( umot ) and ultrasound modulated electrical impedance tomography ( umeit ) is to reconstruct the coefficient @xmath23 from measurements of the form , i.e. , since we assume that @xmath35 is known , from measurements of the form @xmath75 , where @xmath0 and @xmath36 are two solutions of the unperturbed equation with ( possibly ) different boundary conditions .    in the setting where @xmath76 , measurements are of the form @xmath77 . plugging the latter expression into the elliptic equation yields the nonlinear equation @xmath78",
    "we thus observe that the reconstruction of @xmath1 may be recast as solving the above nonlinear partial differential equation .",
    "it turns out that the above equation is not directly amenable to analysis .",
    "however , the above expression makes clear the connection between inverse problems with internal information and nonlinear partial differential equations .",
    "the methodology to obtain follows the presentation in @xcite and is very similar in spirit to the derivation obtained in @xcite .",
    "an alternative method based on physical focusing in time of acoustic signals has been presented in @xcite .",
    "assuming the validity of the above derivation , the mathematical problem of interest in this paper is as follows .",
    "we want to reconstruct @xmath23 from knowledge of the interior functionals @xmath79 where @xmath7 is the solution to the equation @xmath80 for appropriate choices of the boundary conditions @xmath81 on @xmath21 .",
    "obviously , we would like @xmath82 to be as small as possible and ideally equal to @xmath83 .",
    "our results propose explicit reconstructions for @xmath84 in dimension @xmath8 and @xmath84 or @xmath85 depending on additional parameters in dimension @xmath9 .",
    "the case of the dimension @xmath86 can be handled in a similar fashion although we shall not present the mathematically more involved and practically less interesting details in this paper .",
    "the main strategy we use to reconstruct @xmath1 from knowledge of @xmath87 is first to write equations for the quantities @xmath88 that are independent of @xmath1 and then to show that @xmath1 is uniquely determined when @xmath89 is known .",
    "this was implemented in the two dimensional setting in @xcite and the main result of this paper is the extension to the three dimensional case .",
    "the extension to arbitrary dimensions is also feasible although we shall restrict ourselves to the cases @xmath90 for concreteness .",
    "we define : @xmath91 using the equations , the definitions and the fact that @xmath92 is a gradient , we obtain : @xmath93      n=2\\,:\\quad   \\left[\\nabla,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\sigma } } s_j \\right ] = 0 \\quad&\\leftrightarrow\\quad [ \\nabla , s_j ] - [ f , s_j ] = 0 , \\label{eq : curlsj2d }   \\\\[2 mm ]      n=3\\ , : \\quad \\nabla\\times \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\sigma } } s_j \\right ) = 0 \\quad&\\leftrightarrow\\quad \\nabla\\times s_j - f\\times s_j = 0 , \\label{eq : curlsj3d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined for @xmath8 the product @xmath94 : = a_x b_y - a_y b_x$ ] and @xmath95 : = \\partial_x a_y - \\partial_y a_x$ ] for smooth vector fields @xmath96 and @xmath97 , while for @xmath9 , @xmath98 is the standard cross product .",
    "we now wish to eliminate @xmath99 from such equations and get a closed form equation for the vectors @xmath89 with sources that only involve the known matrix @xmath100 .",
    "such an elimination requires that we find @xmath16 vectors @xmath89 that form a basis of @xmath101 for @xmath90 . in dimension",
    "@xmath8 , it is not difficult to find such a basis for all @xmath102 . in dimension @xmath103 , we are able to construct such bases on subset of @xmath101 that cover @xmath20 using triplets of vectors that depend on the subset .",
    "we thus consider the above equations for @xmath89 and @xmath99 over an open subset @xmath104 , over which we make the assumption that @xmath105 where the @xmath16 vectors @xmath106 for @xmath107 are chosen among the @xmath82 vectors considered in . since the determinants are central in our derivations , we define @xmath108 for all @xmath109 .",

    ", we have @xmath112 , and for @xmath9 , we may write @xmath113 after successively using the cauchy - schwarz inequality and a property of the cross - product . then , since @xmath114 ( by regularity of the solutions and assuming @xmath1 continuous ) , the assumption   is equivalent to @xmath100 being invertible over @xmath115 . in this case",

    "for instance , we may choose @xmath121 on @xmath21 and we are then guaranteed that @xmath122 is a diffeomorphism from @xmath20 to its image so that the determinant is clearly signed , and by continuity ( assuming that @xmath1 is sufficiently smooth so that gradients are continuous functions , which we also assume for the rest of the paper @xcite ) , bounded from below by a positive constant .    in three dimensions , there is no known guarantee that the determinant of three solutions with prescribed boundary conditions remains positive throughout the domain @xmath20 independent of the conductivity @xmath1 . for boundary conditions of the form @xmath123 on @xmath21 for @xmath124 , it is known that the determinant can change signs for some conductivities @xcite .",

    "<S> this allow us to construct the power density of the equation point - wise inside the domain . </S>",
    "<S> such a setting finds applications in ultrasound modulated electrical impedance tomography and ultrasound modulated optical tomography .    </S>",
    "<S> we show that the diffusion coefficient can be uniquely and stably reconstructed from knowledge of a sufficient large number of power densities . </S>",
    "<S> explicit expressions for the reconstruction of the diffusion coefficient are also provided . </S>",
    "<S> such results hold for a large class of boundary conditions for the elliptic equation in the two - dimensional setting . in three dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> the results are proved for a more restrictive class of boundary conditions constructed by means of complex geometrical optics solutions . </S>"
