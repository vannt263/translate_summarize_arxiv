    "there are two main questions we want to discuss in this paper .",
    "the first question is a physical one : how does disorder influence criticality ? taken that a non - disordered ( `` ideal '' ) system possesses a phase transition and a critical behavior governed by some scaling laws , will these universal laws be altered by disorder introduced into the system ?",
    "the second question elaborated below is related to the unknown convergence properties of the series that result from the perturbative treatment of the corresponding models .",
    "the first question we address here is rather specific since it concerns properties in a narrow region of the phase diagram in the vicinity of a critical point . nonetheless , in order to give an extensive description of current studies in the field we are forced to restrict the subject further .",
    "in particular , in the present paper we will be interested only in static critical properties leaving the bulk of dynamic phenomena outside of our scope .",
    "we will choose three - dimensional systems of infinite size ignoring the influence of surfaces on the critical behaviour though such problems are very attractive @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we will address the subtle limit of weak disorder where the random system can be treated as perturbed with respect to an `` ideal '' one ; this disregards the class of phenomena relevant in the strong disorder limit , like those appearing in the vicinity of a percolation threshold .",
    "finally , we will touch only the quenched `` frozen '' disorder . to summarize ,",
    "the main scope of our review will cover the static criticality of random quenched three - dimensional systems . in spite of our restriction of the subject ,",
    "a lot of fascinating and still unsolved problems remain as we will try to convince the reader in our subsequent exposition .    to get a quantitative description of the phenomena occurring in the vicinity of the critical point",
    "it is standard to rely on renormalization group methods @xcite . in this approach",
    "the physical quantities describing the critical behavior are obtained in the form of perturbation theory series .",
    "for some ideal ( undiluted ) systems these series have proven to be asymptotic and to have a zero radius of convergence .",
    "therefore , special resummation methods are used to extract reliable data from the series . however , so far there is no proof of the asymptotic nature of the perturbation theory series for disordered ( diluted ) models .",
    "moreover , there exist serious indications of possible non - asymptotic divergences .",
    "nonetheless , the bulk of results that were obtained from the perturbation theory expansions of disordered models are presented _ as if _ they were asymptotic .",
    "here arises the second question we address in this paper : how does the possible non - asymptotic nature show up in the analysis of perturbation theory expansions for the models with weak quenched disorder ? putting the first and the second questions together , the main goal of the current review will be to discuss what information about the influence of weak quenched disorder on the critical behavior can one extract working with renormalization group perturbation theory series .",
    "the set - up of the paper is as follows . in the next section [ ii ]",
    "we discuss different models of weak quenched disorder and introduce the physical quantities used for their description . here , of main interest for us will be systems with non - correlated point - like defects , systems with long - range correlated disorder and systems with disorder in the form of random anisotropy . in section [ iii ] we give examples of experimental realizations of such systems .",
    "these include : site  diluted magnets , @xmath0 in porous medium , magnets with extended impurities , polymers in random media , some amorphous rare - earth  transition metal alloys .",
    "the effective hamiltonians for the disordered models under consideration are given in section [ iv ] together with the main relations of the field theoretical renormalization group theory . in section [ v ]",
    "we describe the methods of resummation of divergent series and in section [ vi ] we display the results obtained by their application to the field theoretical renormalization group expansions .",
    "we conclude and give an outlook in the section [ vii ] .",
    "we start our consideration from one of the simplest and most carefully studied models which is introduced as a generalization of the hierarchy of the lattice ising model , the @xmath1model and the heisenberg model .",
    "consider a simple ( hyper)cubic lattice of the dimension @xmath2 , to each site of which it is prescribed a @xmath3component vector @xmath4 with a fixed length ( for convenience of further notation one usually sets @xmath5 ) .",
    "imposing a pair interaction with the energy proportional to the scalar products between pairs of spins , one defines the stanley model ( it is also known as @xmath3vector , @xmath6symmetric or generalized classical heisenberg model ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the stanley model reads @xcite : @xmath7 where the @xmath2-dimensional vectors @xmath8 span the sites of a simple ( hyper)cubic lattice ( see fig . [ stanley.eps ] ) and @xmath9 is an isotropic and translationally invariant short - range interaction .",
    "the stanley model has further been generalized by analytic continuation in @xmath3 to describe critical properties of self - avoiding walks ( @xmath10 ) , spherical ferromagnet ( @xmath11 ) , the gaussian model ( @xmath12 ) , etc .",
    "a many  body system described by the model ( [ stanley ] ) can undergo a continuous phase transition into a ferromagnetic phase .",
    "yet , the transition occurs only for lattice dimensions @xmath2 larger than a certain lower critical dimension @xmath13 .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath13 is a function of the spin component number @xmath3 .",
    "if the hamiltonian ( [ stanley ] ) remains invariant under continuous rotations in the space of vectors @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath14 , one can show that @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "otherwise , for @xmath16 ( the ising model ) the continuous @xmath6 symmetry degenerates into a discrete one corresponding to the invariance of the hamiltonian ( [ stanley ] ) under discrete flip of all spins to the opposite direction . in this case @xmath17",
    "@xcite .    in the theory of critical phenomena one is interested in the peculiarities of the behavior in the vicinity of the critical temperature @xmath18 .",
    "the critical temperature essentially depends on microscopic details of the model .",
    "however , asymptotically close to @xmath19 the thermodynamic and correlation functions for very different systems may depend on the external parameters by the same power - like functions .",
    "these functions are primarily characterized by their critical exponents .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath20 of a physical observable @xmath21 asymptotically close to the critical point @xmath19 is defined by @xcite : @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the reduced distance to the critical point .",
    "for instance , the magnetic susceptibility @xmath24 diverges as : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the susceptibility critical exponent , while @xmath27 and @xmath28 are critical amplitudes above and below the critical point respectively .",
    "the power law of type ( [ exp_def ] ) is exact in the asymptotic regime @xmath29 .",
    "the definitions of the most common static critical exponents of a magnet are provided in table [ tab1 ] .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     as we have seen from the analysis of the subsection [ vic ] the local anisotropy axis distribution has a crucial influence on the scenarios of low - temperature behavior . for the ram with isotropic distribution",
    "the inaccessibility of any stable fixed point leads to the conclusion that a second order phase transition is absent .",
    "the existence of a reachable disordered ising - like fixed point in case of the ram with cubic distribution of the random anisotropy axis indicates that the system undergoes a second order phase transition with the critical exponents of the weakly diluted quenched ising model . here",
    ", we want to attract the readers attention to the similarity of the critical behavior of both the random - site @xcite and the random - anisotropy @xcite quenched magnets : if new critical behavior is present then it is always governed by the critical exponents of the site - diluted ising type .",
    "the above calculations of a  phase diagram \" of the ram are based on two - loop expansions improved by a resummation technique .",
    "once the qualitative picture becomes clear there is no need to go into higher orders of a perturbation theory as far as the critical exponents of site - diluted ising model are known by now with high accuracy ( see table  [ table_theory ] and discussion of the subsection  [ via ] ) .",
    "to conclude this review , let us return to the question posed in the introduction : what information about the influence of weak quenched disorder on criticality can one get analyzing the rg expansions ? comparing the results of the theoretical analysis in section [ vi ] with the available data about different physical phenomena listed in section [ iii ] one definitely can state that in most cases the rg analysis provides a correct description .",
    "indeed , the change of the universality class of the ising model upon weak quenched dilution predicted by the rg analysis is confirmed by numerous experiments on diluted uniaxial magnets @xmath30 , @xmath31 as well as by extensive mc simulations ( c. f. data of the table [ table_theory ] and of the section [ iii ] ) . by high precision experiments under microgravity conditions",
    "it was shown @xcite that the specific heat asymptotic critical exponent of liquid @xmath0 for the @xmath32-transition is not influenced by quenched disorder and belongs to the universality class of the @xmath33 stanley model .",
    "this result also follows from the rg analysis as far as the stanley model heat capacity critical exponent @xmath34 changes its sign already for @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the mc simulations of self - avoiding walks on random - site lattices @xcite confirmed the theoretical result of ref .",
    "@xcite that universal properties of self - avoiding walks are not influenced by point - like uncorrelated disorder . the change of the universality class of self - avoiding walks by a long - range - correlated disorder predicted by the rg analysis @xcite waits for an experimental or simulational confirmation .",
    "the mc study of the influence of the long - range - correlated disorder on the ferromagnetic phase transition confirms the change of the universality class in this case @xcite .",
    "one more interesting check of the rg predictions might be the verification ( experimental or in mc simulations ) of the envisaged random ising model critical behavior for the random anisotropy magnet with a cubic distribution of the anisotropy axis @xcite .",
    "as we have seen in these lectures , for the majority of the phenomena listed above a careful analysis of the rg expansions provides also a quantitative description , giving reliable numbers for the physical values describing criticality .",
    "however , if one compares the rg expansions for non - diluted (  pure \" ) and diluted systems one certainly notices essential differences .",
    "a typical scenario that one encounters when analyzing the critical properties of the @xmath36 stanley model ( i.e. applying the field theoretical rg technique to the @xmath6-symmetrical @xmath37 model ) may be sketched by two steps : ( i ) already in the first non - trivial order of the perturbation theory one observes a new non - trivial critical behavior ( a stable non - trivial fixed point ) ; ( ii ) the higher order contributions do not change the picture qualitatively and improve the numerical outcome provided the resummation is applied .",
    "this scenario does not hold for most of the models with disorder . here",
    ", the first - order perturbation theory expansions as a rule do not lead to new criticality ( a non - trivial fixed point is absent or its stability is questioned ) .",
    "the ( experimentally confirmed ! ) answer about new critical behavior is obtained only by considering higher order contributions with the help of the resummation technique .",
    "but then again , even the resummed series appear to be divergent starting from some order of perturbation theory showing an  optimal truncation \" behavior .",
    "some expansions that are familiar and useful for the  pure \" models appear to be of no use for certain disordered models : e.g. the @xmath38-expansion turns into the @xmath39-expansion for the random - site ising model and does not lead to any quantitative information .    technically , this  strange \" behavior of the perturbation theory expansions for the disordered models is not strange : it rather signals the divergent nature of the series .",
    "for some disordered models this behavior was shown @xcite to originate from griffith - like singularities @xcite caused by zeroes of the partition function of the pure system .",
    "the physical reason for griffith singularities is the existence of ordered islands within the temperature interval below the critical temperature of the pure model and above that of the diluted model .",
    "so in this sense the studies of random models reviewed above may serve as examples when more complicated physics leads to a more complicated theoretical description .",
    "and as one may conclude from the results obtained so far in many cases this description is a fruitful one .",
    "the materials presented here were the subject of lectures given by one of us in summer semester 2001 in the universit henri poincar , nancy 1 ( france ) and at the 2nd pamporovo workshop on cooperative phenomena in condensed matter ( august 2001 , bulgaria ) .",
