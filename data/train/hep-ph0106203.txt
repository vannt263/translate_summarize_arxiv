    "the investigation of rare semileptonic @xmath3 decays induced by the flavour - changing neutral current transitions @xmath4 and @xmath5 represents an important test of the standard model or its extentions .",
    "rare decays are forbidden at the tree level in the standard model and occur through loop diagrams .",
    "thus they provide the possibility to probe the structure of the electroweak sector at large mass scales from contributions of virtual particles in the loop diagrams .",
    "interesting information about the structure of the theory is contained in the wilson coefficents in the effective hamiltonian which describes the @xmath6 transition at low energies .",
    "these wilson coefficients take different values in different theories with testable consequences in rare @xmath3 decays .    among rare",
    "@xmath3 decays the radiative decays @xmath7 and @xmath8 have the largest probabilites .",
    "the @xmath7 transitions are ckm favoured and have larger branching ratios than the @xmath8 transitions . the @xmath7 transition has been observed by cleo in the exclusive channel @xmath9 in 1993 and measured inclusively in 1995 .",
    "the @xmath10 decay will be extensively studied by babar and belle .",
    "the main uncertainty in the theoretical analysis of @xmath3 decays is connected with long - distance qcd effects arising from the presence of hadrons in initial and final states . in inclusive decays these effects are under better control , however from inclusive measurements it is more difficult to obtain precise results .",
    "the decay amplitude contains two different contributions : one arising from the electromagnetic penguin operator and another from the 4-fermion operators in the effective hamiltonian .",
    "one of the effects generated by the 4-fermion operators is the weak annihilation ( wa ) .",
    "further details about short- and long - distance effects in the radiative decays can be found in recent publications @xcite and references therein .    in the @xmath9 decay",
    "the weak annihilation is negligible compared to the penguin effect : it is suppressed by two powers of the small parameter @xmath11 of the cabbibo - kabayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix . in @xmath10",
    "both effects have the same order in @xmath12 and must be taken into account .",
    "the penguin contribution has been analyzed in several ways and is known quite well . on the other hand ,",
    "the wa in @xmath10 has been studied in less detail : the relevant form factors were analyzed within sum rules @xcite and perturbative qcd @xcite .",
    "however , some contributions to these form factors were neglected .",
    "these contributions may be relevant if precise measurements become available .",
    "the aim of this paper is to analyze the weak annihilation for the @xmath13 decay more closely .    in the factorization approximation ,",
    "the weak - annihilation amplitude can be represented as the product of meson leptonic decay constants and matrix elements of the weak current between meson and photon .",
    "the latter contain the meson - photon transition form factors and contact terms which are determined by the equations of motion .",
    "the photon can be emitted from the loop containing the @xmath14 quark which is described by @xmath1 transition form factors .",
    "it can also be emitted from the loop containing only light quarks described by the @xmath2 transition form factors ( fig [ fig : diag ] ) .",
    "we calculate the @xmath1 form factors within the relativistic dispersion approach which expresses these form factors in terms of the @xmath3 meson wave function .",
    "we demonstrate that the form factors calculated by the dispersion approach behave in the limit @xmath15 in agreement with perturbative qcd .",
    "the @xmath3 meson wave function was previously tested in the @xmath16 light meson weak decays and is known quite well , allowing us to provide reliable numerical estimates for the @xmath1 form factors .",
    "the @xmath2 transition form factor is related to the divergence of the vector and axial - vector currents . in the case of the axial - vector current",
    "it is proportional to the light - quark masses if the classical equation of motion is applied .",
    "because the quark momenta in the loop are high , these masses have to be identified with current quark masses .",
    "for this reason the corresponding @xmath2 form factor was neglected in previous analyses @xcite .",
    "we find however that this argument is not correct : this form factor remains finite in the limit of vanishing light quark mass @xmath17 and behaves like @xmath18 which means the violation of the classical equation of motion .",
    "we present the result for the @xmath2 transition form factor but leave a detailed discussion of the anomaly appearing for the matrix element @xmath19 for a special publication .",
    "finally , we provide numerical estimates of the weak - annihilation amplitude taking into account the @xmath1 , @xmath2 transition form factors , and the contact term contributions .    in section ii the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath5 transition and the general structure of the amplitude are presented . in section iii",
    "we discuss the photon emission from the @xmath3 meson loop and obtain the @xmath1 transition form factors within the dispersion approach .",

    "the corresponding contribution to the invariant amplitudes is therefore @xmath54      the radiative @xmath55 transition also receives contribution from the 4-fermion operators @xmath56 and @xmath57 . for the charged @xmath58 transition the corresponding amplitude reads @xmath59 in what follows we suppress the lable wa . neglecting the nonfactorizable soft - gluon exchanges , i.e. assuming vacuum saturation , the complicated matrix element in eq .",

    "this approach has been formulated in detail in @xcite and applied to the weak decays of heavy mesons in @xcite .",
    "recall that the form factors @xmath87 describe the transition of the @xmath3-meson to the photon with the momentum @xmath25 , @xmath27 , induced by the axial - vector ( vector ) current with the momentum transfer @xmath23 , @xmath28 . for technical reasons",
