    "anderson localization  @xcite is one of the most fundamental and ubiquitous quantum phenomena . conventionally , strong localization is thought of as occurring in real space in spatially extended disordered systems with the system size much larger than the localization length .",
    "it was , however , pointed out in a seminal paper  @xcite by altshuler , gefen , kamenev , and levitov ( agkl ) that anderson localization can also manifest itself in a disordered ( or chaotic ) quantum dot where single - particle states extend through the whole system . in this case , localization takes place not in the coordinate space but in the fock space of the interacting quantum system and is closely related to the concepts of ergodicity and thermalization .",
    "the work of agkl was largely motivated by two influential papers on quantum dots : the experiment by sivan _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , which measured the quasiparticle spectrum of a quantum dot , and by the subsequent theoretical work by sivan , imry , and aronov  @xcite ( sia ) where a golden - rule analysis of this problem was performed .",
    "agkl emphasized that the golden - rule calculation becomes inapplicable at low quasiparticle energies because of anderson localization in fock space .",
    "they developed an hierarchical fock - space model for the problem of a `` hot quasiparticle '' decay in a quantum dot and argued that the problem can be reduced to a tight - binding anderson model on the bethe lattice  @xcite with a large coordination number . on this basis",
    ", they concluded that there is an anderson localization transition in fock space which takes place at the energy of the order of [ e1 ] e_1/2=(g / g)^1/2  .",
    "here , @xmath0 is the characteristic single - electron level spacing in the dot , and @xmath1 is the dimensionless conductance which determines the characteristic value of the interaction matrix elements @xmath2",
    ". the energy scale ( [ e1 ] ) can be found , up to a logarithmic factor , by equating @xmath3 and the characteristic level spacing of three - particle states to which a single - particle state is directly coupled by the interaction .",
    "subsequent work  @xcite has corroborated the basic physical picture proposed by agkl .",
    "in particular , the bethe - lattice framework of ref .  @xcite was supported and substantiated by the analysis  @xcite of fluctuations near the localization transition on the bethe lattice with a large coordination number .",
    "however , refs .",
    "@xcite also emphasized important deficiencies of the agkl arguments in regard to the connection between the quantum - dot and bethe - lattice problems .",
    "first , jacquod and shepelyansky  @xcite pointed out that the number of directly connected states decreases as @xmath4 with increasing generation number @xmath5 in the problem of a hot quasiparticle decay ( in ref .",
    "@xcite , this circumstance was noted but neglected in order `` to simplify the discussion '' ) and that this has important ramifications .",
    "namely , eq",
    ".  ( [ e1 ] ) does not represent the transition energy for the quantum - dot problem but rather gives the lower boundary of a parametrically broad energy interval within which higher fock - space generations become gradually admixed to the original hot - electron state .",
    "one of the questions that arise then is at what energy all generations `` get mixed up '' .",
    "an extension of the agkl argument to the resulting `` typical '' many - particle states leads  @xcite to the replacement of the energy in eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) by a parametrically larger energy scale [ e2 ] e_2/3=g^2/3  .",
    "this energy scale emerges if one compares @xmath3 and the level spacing of the states to which a typical state is coupled directly .",
    "second , silvestrov  @xcite noted strong cancellations in higher orders of the schrdinger perturbation theory and pointed out  @xcite that , if the cancellations compensate for the @xmath6 growth of the number of contributions to the coupling at @xmath5th order , the localization threshold will be at the energy of the order of [ e3 ] e_1=(g / g )  , instead of eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "he stated , however , that this scenario `` seems very unlikely '' and that eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) is `` more physically motivated . ''",
    "a considerable number of works have studied the problem by means of numerical simulations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the scaling analysis of a crossover between the poisson and wigner - dyson statistics of many - body energy levels  and thus between localization and delocalization ( quantum chaos)was performed within the `` two - body random interaction model '' ( tbrim ) . the conclusion  @xcite was that the crossover takes place around @xmath7 . in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , a gradual delocalization of single - particle states within the tbrim was reported , in qualitative agreement with refs .",
    "@xcite , and @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the localization - delocalization crossover with increasing energy of many - particle states was observed through the exact diagonalization of a tight - binding many - particle hamiltonian , although the system size was too small to extract information on the scaling of the position and sharpness of the crossover with @xmath8 .",
    "leyronas , silvestrov , and beenakker  @xcite used a restricted ( `` layered '' ) version of the tbrim where only a subset of matrix elements was kept . analyzing numerically the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) , which characterizes spreading of many - body eigenstates in fock space , they concluded that the crossover to chaos takes place around the energy @xmath9 , and that the crossover likely becomes a sharp transition in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "later , the problem was considered by rivas , mucciolo , and kamenev  @xcite within a self - consistent approximation to the quasiparticle green function .",
    "solving numerically the self - consistent equations , they found a gradual spreading of a hot - electron state starting from the energy scale @xmath10 , in qualitative agreement with the previous analytical arguments  @xcite and numerical works  @xcite . on the other hand , the analysis of the ipr for many - body eigenstates led the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite to the conclusion that the localization transition is not governed by the parameter @xmath11 , contrary to the results of ref .",
    "specifically , it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that an intermediate regime , where neither the localized - regime nor the golden - rule formulas for the ipr describe the numerical results , becomes broader as @xmath8 is increased .",
    "more recently , two papers  @xcite extended the ideas of agkl to explore the localization properties of high - energy states in disordered many - body systems with spatially localized single - particle states .",
    "as a prime example , such a question necessarily arises when one considers ( quasi-)one - dimensional systems at nonzero temperature , since all single - particle states are localized in this geometry .",
    "it was found  @xcite that the system exhibits a transition between the low - temperature localized phase  @xcite and the high - temperature delocalized phase  @xcite at the temperature [ e4 ] t_c ~  , where @xmath12 is the characteristic single - particle level spacing in the localization volume , and @xmath13 is the dimensionless strength of ( short - range ) interaction . while the approximations used in refs .",
    "@xcite were somewhat different , the results for @xmath14 are the same , up to a numerical prefactor , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent detailed discussion .",
    "references  @xcite have triggered a considerable amount of research on the nature of many - body localization in extended systems .",
    "most intensively the problem has been studied through numerical simulations of disordered interacting one - dimensional systems , see , in particular , refs .  @xcite . by and large ,",
    "the numerical results have provided support for the existence of the localization - delocalization transition . on the other hand",
    ", the nature of the delocalized phase still remains controversial .",
    "two recent numerical works  @xcite concluded that transport in the delocalized phase just above the transition is of a subdiffusive nature ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "if true , this would imply , at least , an intermediate delocalized phase with zero dc conductivity , with ref .",
    "@xcite suggesting that transport is subdiffusive throughout the whole delocalized part of the parameter space of the problem .",
    "many - body localization was discussed in both normal and superconducting systems ; in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite analyzed many - body localization in the vicinity of a superconductor - insulator transition , also in connection with available experimental data .",
    "recently , experimental evidence of a finite - temperature many - body localization transition was reported for amorphous indium - oxide films  @xcite and for fermionic atoms in a `` quasi - random '' one - dimensional optical lattice  @xcite ( many - body localization of cold atoms was studied experimentally also in an array of coupled one - dimensional optical lattices  @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the problem of localization of many - body states in a quantum dot . while a large number of works addressed this problem both analytically and numerically ( mainly during the years 1997 - 2002 , as outlined above ) , the obtained results are in part ambiguous or contradictory  despite much progress  even at the conceptual level . in particular , there remains ambiguity as to the very basic questions : ( 1 ) at what energy does the many - body localization - delocalization crossover in a quantum dot take place ?",
    "( 2 ) what is the width of the crossover ? does the crossover become a sharp transition , for proper scaling , in the limit of a large dot ?",
    "( 3 ) what is the behavior of observables in the localized and delocalized phases , and in the critical region ?    our goal is to provide answers to the above questions within a unifying analytical framework . among the observables , we particularly focus on the many - body level statistics and on temporal relaxation of various types of excited many - body states .",
    "although we concentrate here on localization in fock space of a finite fermion system , we expect that the solution of the quantum dot problem will be essential for answering the open questions concerning many - body localization in spatially extended systems .",
    "we begin by briefly reminding the reader about the formulation of the problem and the relevant parameters . we consider a disordered quantum dot with the mean single - particle level spacing @xmath0 ( the average single - particle density of states is given by @xmath15 ) and the dimensionless conductance @xmath1 .",
    "the system is isolated from the `` external world '' : the conductance @xmath8 characterizes the interior of the quantum dot . the thouless energy @xmath16 is given by the product @xmath17 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system reads @xmath18 written in the basis of single - particle orbitals with random energies @xmath19 .",
    "the single - particle states are coupled by a two - particle interaction whose matrix elements @xmath20 are taken to be random quantities with zero mean ( the hartree - fock terms are assumed to be accommodated in the first term in @xmath21 ) . for ( internally ) screened coulomb interaction , the root - mean - square matrix element  @xcite v~/g [ v ] for energies of the interacting single - particle states all within an energy band of width @xmath16 .",
    "the matrix elements for couplings outside this band are strongly suppressed and play no role in what follows .",
    "being closed , the system is characterized by a discrete spectrum ( of both single - particle and many - particle states ) .",
    "that is , in contrast to spatially extended systems , the perturbation theory in powers of the interaction can not diverge and no broadening of the spectra is generated in higher - order resummations .",
    "the coupling between single - particle states only leads to their mutual hybridization , i.e. , to a spreading of an excitation in fock space .",
    "it is the `` depth '' of this spreading that is the subject of the problem . in terms of observables ,",
    "the spreading can be probed , e.g. , in the tunneling spectrum by slightly opening the quantum dot through a tunnel coupling to the lead(s ) .",
    "more specifically , in the absence of interaction , the many - body eigenstates are slater determinants built out of the eigenstates of the disordered single - particle hamiltonian .",
    "these slater determinants form the basis of fock space .",
    "the interaction - induced hybridization of the basis states raises the question on how the exact eigenstates in the presence of interaction are spread over the basis states .",
    "this question can be viewed as one about the degree of localization of the many - body eigenstates in fock space , which has much in common with the problem of anderson localization of noninteracting particles in real space .",
    "two limiting cases are : ( i ) strong localization , when an exact state almost coincides with one of the noninteracting states , with a small admixture of a few neighboring fock - space basis states , and ( ii ) strong delocalization , when an exact state is spread over all the basis states that have energies within the energy band given by the golden rule .",
    "one of the main problems here , which we address below , is that of the parameters characterizing the crossover ( or the transition , provided the appropriate scaling limit exists ) between these two extremes with varying excitation energy @xmath22 .    for zero temperature , we parametrize a many - body excitation by its total energy @xmath22 and its single - particle content . for given @xmath22 ,",
    "depending on the single - particle content , two limits of prime interest are a `` hot electron '' excitation and a `` typical '' many - body excitation . in the first case ,",
    "a single electron with energy @xmath22 is excited above the many - body ground state .",
    "this is the problem that was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the second case",
    ", the excitation energy @xmath22 is divided between n_e ~(e/)^1/2 [ n_e ] quasiparticles whose characteristic single - particle energy determines the `` effective temperature '' of the system t_e~(e)^1/2  .",
    "[ t_e ] as a characteristic example , one can think of a basis state with @xmath23 quasiparticles . in the typical many - body excitation ,",
    "the total energy @xmath24 scales quadratically with the number of excited quasiparticles : @xmath25 .",
    "note that the number @xmath26 of excited many - body states with energy @xmath22 grows exponentially with @xmath23 , namely @xmath27 , i.e. , n_~(e/)^1/2  .",
    "[ n_mb ]    below , we study the problem of relaxation in fock space by focusing on three types of excitations with energy @xmath28 : ( i ) a single hot electron `` on top '' of the exact zero - temperature ground state ; ( ii ) a `` typical '' many - body excitation in the form of a basis state consisting of @xmath23 single - particle states ; ( iii ) an extra single - particle excitation with the energy of the order of @xmath29 on top of the exact eigenstate characterized by the effective temperature @xmath29 .",
    "note that problem ( iii ) has particularly much in common with the problem of charge and/or energy spreading ( and , correspondingly , finite - temperature localization ) in real space  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [ s2 ] , we investigate how far each of the initial states described above extends in fock space in the long - time limit .",
    "this will allow us , in particular , to establish a `` phase boundary '' between the localized and delocalized phases in the sense of the anderson transition in fock space . in sec .",
    "[ sec : statistics ] , we show that the localization - delocalization crossover ( which , in particular , manifests itself in the change between the poisson and wigner - dyson spectral statistics for many - body energy levels ) becomes a sharp transition in the limit of large @xmath8 and analyze the critical behavior of the level statistics . in sec .",
    "[ s5 ] , we complement the long - time - limit analysis of sec .  [ s2 ] by a discussion of the temporal evolution of the initial states . finally , in sec .",
    "[ s6 ] , we compare our results with previous numerical findings and discuss the connection of the delocalization transition in a quantum dot to the spatial many - body localization .",
    "let us start by considering the problem of relaxation of a single - particle excitation with energy @xmath28 above the ground state at zero temperature .",
    "the elementary process for this kind of relaxation is a decay of the initial single - particle state into a three - particle state ( two electrons and one hole ) by exciting an electron - hole pair .",
    "the characteristic level spacing of the final ( three - particle ) states is given by _",
    "3(e)~^3/e^2  .",

    ", the initial single - particle state is well connected to ( a subset of ) distant many - body states that are constructed out of the maximum number @xmath23 [ eq .  ( [ n_e ] ) ] of single - particle states ( `` delocalized regime '' ) .",
    "however , in a logarithmically wide interval @xmath43 , where @xmath44 the single - particle tunneling density of states ( dos ) , given by the overlap matrix elements between the single - particle states and the exact eigenstates , experiences strong fluctuations ( in the sense that the sharp resonances in the dos  recall that the system is finite  that group together do not show a regular pattern for the envelope of a group ) .",
    "the energy scale @xmath45 corresponds to the condition @xmath46 which implies that a single - particle state at energy @xmath22 is strongly hybridized with available three - particle states .",

    "( [ gamma = delta3 ] ) is that a self - consistent broadening of the single - particle levels ( if one employs the notion of self - consistency in the spirit of the golden - rule calculation ) at this energy is of the order of the relevant ( three - particle ) level spacing .",
    "the difference in the logarithmic factor between @xmath45 and @xmath37 is traced back to the contribution to the hybridization of rare resonances between the sites in fock space  @xcite . for @xmath49 , the peaks in the single - particle dos ( which are clusters of the `` partial peaks '' that describe multiple channels for the hybridization of a given single - particle excitation ) acquire a regular lorentzian envelope whose width is given by the golden - rule decay rate .",

    "@xcite was the replacement of the actual graph in fock space by the bethe lattice ( a tree with a constant branching number ) .",
    "as already briefly mentioned in sec .",
    "[ s0 ] , this approximation is insufficient for determining the chaotization threshold ( in the finite system ) for the following two reasons .",
    "\\(i ) the branching number is not constant : it decreases with increasing number of steps in the hybridization process .",
    "this introduces a factorial in the generation number @xmath5 suppression of the coupling between the initial single - particle state and the final many - particle states  @xcite .",
    "this is because higher - order matrix elements for transitions between distant states in fock space are dominated by the contributions of intermediate ( virtual ) states that approximately conserve the total energy along the paths in fock space .",
    "this implies that the effective phase space for higher - order processes is reduced , since the total energy @xmath22 is redistributed among many single - particle states . as a result of the energy partitioning , the level spacing for elementary processes at generation @xmath5",
