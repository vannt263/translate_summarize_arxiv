    "the discovery of iron - based superconductors ( fescs ) opened new avenues in the research of strongly correlated systems .",
    "@xcite despite the diversity in crystallographic structure and chemical composition , all the fescs share several generic trends .",
    "fescs are multiband and multipocket materials . according to angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) the fermi surface ( fs ) contains two or three hole pockets at the center of the brillouin zone , the @xmath1 point , and two electron pockets centered at @xmath2 , the @xmath3 point in two - iron - atom unit - cell notations .",
    "the underdoped compounds undergo structural tetragonal to orthorhombic transition at the temperature @xmath4 followed by or coincident with the spin density wave ( sdw ) transition at @xmath5 . the superconductivity sets in when the magnetism is suppressed by doping  @xcite or pressure  @xcite .",
    "the interplay between the magnetism and superconductivity is manifest in the weak - coupling renormalization - group analysis of competing instabilities .",
    "@xcite the interaction amplitude in the spin - density - wave channel is renormalized in a way similar to that for the usual renormalization in the particle - particle channel that normally leads to cooper instability . above the fermi energy @xmath6",
    "the two channels affect each other . as a result ,",
    "the interpocket pairing interaction is enhanced by the spin fluctuations , which were suggested to drive the unconventional @xmath7 superconductivity with the order parameter changing sign between the electron and hole fss . in this picture",
    "low ( high ) doping makes the magnetic ( cooper ) instability a winner in a competition at energies below @xmath6 .",
    "it follows that the proximity of the magnetic and superconducting phases on a phase diagram is not accidental .",
    "hence , the understanding of magnetic and structural transitions is instrumental for the description of the superconductivity .",
    "most commonly , at the magnetic transition the continuous @xmath8 symmetry and the discrete time - reversal symmetry are broken . in the fescs",
    "the spin alignment is magnetic along one direction and antiferromagnetic in the orthogonal direction .",
    "such stripe magnetization lowers , therefore , the discrete @xmath9 rotational symmetry of the lattice down to @xmath10 .",
    "the possibility of breaking the @xmath9 symmetry without breaking the spin @xmath8 and time - reversal symmetry was studied in the context of the structural transition , and the corresponding transition was referred to as being ising nematic .",
    "@xcite in this picture , below @xmath4 the spin - correlation length increases in one of the symmetry directions and decreases in the other , and the magnetisms sets in with little or no delay .",
    "the prevailing scenario of the structural transition is electronic .",
    "specific to fescs is a rather high degree of @xmath11 anisotropy in the electronic properties .",
    "the resistivity anisotropy @xmath12 in cobalt - doped bafe@xmath13as@xmath13 is reported @xcite to reach values as high as 2 for cobalt concentration @xmath14 , whereas the maximal orthorhombic distortion for the parent material , @xmath15 , is only about 0.36@xmath16 .",

    "@xcite the @xmath18 so obtained is only 22k lower than the actual transition temperature , @xmath19= 138k .",
    "the relatively small difference @xmath20 is due to the lattice fluctuations being suppressed under the conditions of fixed strain .",
    "likewise , the optical reflectivity is nearly divergent at the nematic transition .",
    "@xcite all these findings are indicative of the dominance of the electronic degrees of freedom in the nematic transition .",
    "it is , in general , hard to disentangle different electronic fluctuation channels breaking the same symmetry . at present the dominance of either charge or spin degrees of freedom in driving the structural transition",
    "is not settled .",
    "there are two schools of thought as to the origin of electronic nematicity .",
    "@xcite in the orbital nematicity scenario the difference in populations @xmath21 of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 iron orbitals is believed to be the primary cause of the nematic transition .",
    "@xcite in another scenario it is the spin that drives the nematic transition .",
    "@xcite let @xmath24 be the two staggered ( antiferromagnetic ) magnetizations on the even and odd iron sublattices , respectively .",
    "the nematic transition occurs when the two spin sublattices lock , @xmath25 .",
    "@xcite the two alternatives are the positive and negative @xmath26 , resulting in two orthogonal stripe magnetizations , @xmath27 .",
    "these are the spin arrangements ferromagnetic in the @xmath28(@xmath29 ) direction and antiferromagnetic in the @xmath29(@xmath28 ) direction in an fe - only lattice .",
    "the magnetic perspective is supported by the nmr data showing a low-@xmath30 curie - weiss - like upturn of a spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath31 ,  @xcite and by the scaling between the magnetic fluctuations and softening of the elastic shear modulus at the structural transition .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we do not attempt to resolve the above controversy , but rather explore the consequences of the nematic fluctuations as observed in recent raman experiments .",
    "@xcite even though the region of the phase diagram contained between @xmath4 and @xmath5 is either absent or quite tiny , the dynamical nematic fluctuations revealed by raman spectroscopy kick in far into the paramagnetic phase up to room temperatures .",
    "the raman spectroscopy is essentially a dynamic probe of electronic correlations of prescribed symmetry .",
    "@xcite the photon scattered inelastically leaves some of its energy with the crystal .",
    "selection rules fix the symmetry of the excitation , while the energy difference between the incoming and scattered photons , the so - called raman shift , determines the energy of the electronic excitations .",
