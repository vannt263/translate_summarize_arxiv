    "of the three proper elements most commonly used to identify an asteroid family , the inclination is the one usually less affected by dynamical evolution .",
    "secular resonances involving the precession frequency of the longitude of the node of an asteroid , like the linear secular resonance with ceres @xmath5 , can , however , change the inclination distribution of families crossed by this kind of resonances @xcite .",
    "this is , for instance , the case of the astrid family , that is characterized by a dispersion in inclination of its members at @xmath6  2.764  au much larger than that of members at other semi - major axis , giving this family a characteristics `` crab - like '' appearance in the @xmath7 plane @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite used the time evolution of the pearson kurtosis of the @xmath0 component of terminal ejection velocities to set independent constraints on the astrid family age and ejection velocity parameter @xmath8 .",
    "since @xmath0 can be obtained by inverting the third gaussequation and is mostly dependent on @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the inclination of the barycenter of the family , families whose distribution in proper inclination is characterized by larger tails and more concentrated peaks than that of a gaussian distribution would have values of pearson kurtosis @xmath4 larger than zero . by simulating fictitious families for different values of ejection velocities parameter @xmath8 under the influence of the yarkovsky non - gravitational force , and by observing when current values of @xmath4 were reached for the astrid families it was possible to set independent constraints on the family age , @xmath8 , and on key parameter determining the strength of the yarkovsky force such as the mean density and surface thermal conductivity of family members .    of the eight @xmath0 leptokurtic families with @xmath2 ,",
    "three are highly inclined families ( @xmath11 ) in the central main belt : the hansa , barcelona , and gallia families @xcite .",
    "it has recently been suggested that these families could be interacting with node secular resonances with vesta @xcite . in this work",
    "we attempt to use the numerical tools developed for the astrid family to i ) assess the importance ( or lack of ) of the @xmath3 secular resonance and of possible analogous resonances with pallas , and ii ) set independent constraints on the three families ages .",
    "overall , we found that the use of the @xmath4 could indeed provide valuable hints on the importance of secular resonances with massive bodies , and , more generally , on the whole dynamical evolution of @xmath4 leptokurtic asteroid families .",
    "as a first step in our analysis of the @xmath0 leptokurtic highly inclined families , we start by identifying the hansa , barcelona and gallia family in the space of proper elements , and by studying the local dynamics . for the first purpose , we use the data from @xcite , where these families were identified in the domain of proper @xmath12 using the hierarchical clustering method and cutoff velocities of 200 m / s for the hansa and gallia families and of 150 m / s for the barcelona one .",
    "the groups so identified have 1094 members for the hansa family , 182 for the gallia group , and 306 for the barcelona cluster . as also discussed in @xcite ,",
    "these three families have s - type taxonomies .",
    "values of the mean geometric albedos for these three groups were 0.26 for hansa , 0.17 for gallia , and 0.25 for barcelona , respectively @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated in depth the local dynamical environment for these families .",
    "the author obtained dynamical maps in the domain of synthetic proper @xmath13 , @xmath7 , and @xmath14 domains .",
    "highly inclined asteroid families in the central main belt are separated by the effect of the local secular dynamics .",
    "the strong @xmath15 secular resonance acts as a dynamical barrier between highly inclined and low inclined asteroids .",
    "of importance are also the other two main linear secular resonances , the @xmath16 and the @xmath17 , that , together with the local mean - motion resonances 3j:-1a , 8j:-3a , and 5j:-2a separate the regions into eight different stable islands .",
    "the region is also crossed by several interesting non - linear secular resonance , whose detailed identification and description can be found in @xcite .",
    "repeating the detailed dynamical analysis of @xcite is of course redundant and beyond the purposes of this paper . to allow the reader to have a visual understanding of the complex local dynamics , in this work we obtained dynamical maps of 7000 particles in the domains of synthetic proper @xmath13 and @xmath7 with the same approach described in @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to that paper for a discussion of the methods and initial conditions used for obtaining these maps .",
    "[ fig : dyn_maps ] displays our results in the @xmath13 ( panel a ) and @xmath7 ( panel b ) planes .",
    "vertical lines display the location of local mean - motion resonances .",
    "objects with eccentricities larger than 0.35 are mars - crossers in this region of the main belt , and are lost on time - scales of @xmath18 1 myr .",
    "the @xmath19 secular resonance causes asteroids in librating states to increase their eccentricity to mars - crossing levels , and to become unstable .",
    "the region associated with this resonance appears as a strip at @xmath20 depleted of proper elements .",
    "other secular resonances appear as inclined alignments of test particles . apart from the @xmath21 , important for its interaction with the barcelona family @xcite , and the @xmath22 linear secular resonances , important non - linear secular resonances in the region are the @xmath23 , and @xmath24 secular resonances .",

    "other symbols are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_maps ] , panel b.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    recently , @xcite suggested that the linear secular resonances @xmath27 with vesta could have played a role in the dynamical evolution of the barcelona and hansa family . to further investigate this hypothesis",
    ", we obtained a dynamic map in the @xmath7 domain , ( node secular resonances change values of asteroids proper inclinations ) with the same initial conditions used before , but adding ceres , vesta , and pallas as massive perturbers .",
    "[ fig : map_ai_cpv ] displays our results .",
    "black circles identify objects whose proper frequency @xmath28 is to within @xmath29 arcsec / yr from the value of vesta , assumed equal to -39.597 arcsec / yr .",
    "these are the objects most likely to be affected by this kind of resonant dynamics .",
    "magenta circles do the same for objects whose @xmath28 is @xmath29 arcsec / yr from -46.393 arcsec / yr , the proper node precession frequency for pallas .",
    "pericenter resonances with vesta were not found to be important for this region in @xcite , and the proper @xmath30 frequency of pallas is outside the range of values covered in this dynamical map .",
    "for these reasons , we did not further investigate the role of pericenter secular resonances with massive asteroids in this work .",
    "the @xmath25 could in principle be affecting the dynamical evolution of the hansa , gallia , and , marginally , the barcelona families .",
    "the @xmath26 resonance , however , does not seem to interact with any of these families , and could play a minor role just for the case of the hansa family .",
    "we will further investigate the role played by those resonances in the next sections .",
    "having briefly revised the local dynamics , we then turn our attention to the taxonomic properties of the three studied families .",
    "taxonomic properties and geometric albedo values of all highly inclined families in the central main belt were studied in @xcite in some detail .",
    "the three families all belong to the s - type taxonomic class .",
    "there are 94 objects with photometric data compatible with a s - type composition in the sloan digital sky survey - moving object catalog data , fourth release ( sdss - moc4 hereafter , @xcite ) in this region .",

    "panel b displays objects whose wise geometric albedo @xmath31 has values compatible with a s - complex taxonomy , ( i.e. , @xmath32 , @xcite ) .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , most of the objects with photometric and albedo s - type compatible data are indeed associated with the three studied families . using the sdss - moc4 data",
    ", we tried to obtain halos for the three families with the method discussed in @xcite for the koronis family . in this method ,",
    "asteroids with sdss - moc4 data are considered to be members of the halo of the family if their values of proper eccentricity and inclination are in a range from the center of dynamical family to within four standard deviations of @xmath33 and @xmath34 of the distribution observed for the hcm family .",
    "we applied this method for the three studied families , but , unfortunately , we are limited by small number statistics for the cases of the gallia and barcelona families , that have halos of less than 10 members .",
    "the hansa family has a halo of 63 members , but its distribution in proper inclination is comparable to that of the hcm family . for the purpose of studying the kurtosis of the @xmath0 component of terminal ejection velocities ,",
    "we are therefore left using standard hcm data alone .",
    "the apparent lack of significant halos for these three families may be caused by the fact that these groups are contained in stable islands surrounded by unstable regions , which limits the number of long - term surviving outlying asteroids .",
    "@xcite studied the shape of the @xmath0 component of the ejection velocity field of these three families , that are among the most leptokurtic among the studied group . for the sake of the reader not familiar with that work",

    "the time evolution of the kurtosis of the @xmath0 component of the ejection velocity field was recently used by @xcite to set constraints on the age and acceptable values of key parameters describing the yarkovsky force , such as the surface thermal conductivity and asteroid density of the astrid asteroid family .",
    "here we use the same approach to investigate the dynamics of the three @xmath0 leptokurtic highly inclined families . the set - up of the simulations",
    "was discussed in @xcite , interested readers could find more details in that paper .",

    "we also generated fictitious families with the optimal values of the ejection parameter @xmath8 found in sect .",
    "[ sec : chron ] , for the three families particles were integrated with @xmath48 , the symplectic integrator developed by @xcite that simulates the diurnal and seasonal versions of the yarkovsky effect , over 1000 myr for the hansa family , 600 myr for the barcelona group , and 800 myr for the gallia cluster , a time long enough to cover the putative estimated ages of these families .",
    "two sets of simulations were performed . in the first we accounted for all planets from mercury to neptune , while in the second we also include ceres , vesta , and pallas as massive bodies . once proper elements were obtained , then values of @xmath0",
    "were computed by inverting the third gauss equation @xcite :    @xmath49    where @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the inclination of the barycenter of the family , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 assumed equal to 30@xmath52 and 50.5@xmath52 , respectively . as discussed in @xcite , the shape of the @xmath0 distribution ( and therefore its kurtosis ) ,",

    "[ fig : gamma_vw ] displays our results for the set of six simulations . since the value of @xmath53 increased significantly when isolated objects drift beyond 4 sigma values in @xmath34 from the center of the family , as in @xcite we eliminated from our computations of this parameters objects with inclination beyond that range .",
    "in particular , this meant considering asteroids with inclination between @xmath54 and @xmath55 for the hansa family , between @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the barcelona family , and between @xmath58 and @xmath59 for the gallia family .",
    "results for the hansa family without the effect of massive asteroids show that values of @xmath53 are compatible with the current one for times larger than 200 myr , which sets a lower limit on the family age . including the massive asteroids",
    "only slightly alters this scenario , which suggest that the effect of resonances with vesta for the hansa family should be minor , when compared with other local resonances able to affect the inclination in the region .",
    "spikes in the time behavior of @xmath53 are associated with isolated asteroids whose inclination temporarily approached values of @xmath34 close to the limits considered in our analysis .",
    "of course , changing the allowed limits of @xmath34 could modify the length and the shape of the isolated spikes observed in fig .",
    "since our goal in this paper is , however , to assess the importance of different dynamical models and since we are using the same limits for the model with and without massive asteroids , we believe that our approach should be reasonable .    concerning the barcelona family , resonances with massive asteroids are not important for this family , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma_vw ] , panels c and d. results are essentially identical with and without massive asteroids , as expected from the results of sect .",
    "[ sec : fam_ide ] , that showed that the barcelona family is not actually crossed by the @xmath25 resonance , or other resonances with massive bodies .",
    "this negative result , however , confirm the usefulness of the @xmath53 as a tool to investigate the long - term behavior of secular dynamics .",
    "as observed for the astrid family @xcite , commonly used values of the key parameters density and thermal conductivity for s - type families are not able to produce the currently observed value of @xmath53 over the estimated age of the family .",
    "this could be either caused by i ) the fact that the mean values of density and thermal conductivity for members of the barcelona family could be higher , or ii ) that the actual age of this family could be younger than what obtained from estimates from the monte carlo method of section  [ sec : chron ] .",
    "an analysis of the full dependence of the @xmath53 time behavior on values of density and thermal conductivity for the barcelona family performed in the same way as recently done for the astrid cluster seems to be outside the goals of this paper , that focused on studying the effectiveness of the use of @xmath53 as a tool to investigate the long - term effect of secular dynamics .",
    "but it certainly remains an interesting topic for future research .",
    "finally , the case of the gallia family is of particular interest .",
    "if we do not consider the effect of secular resonances with vesta , the simulated @xmath53 does not reach current values over the estimated age of the family .",
    "but there is an excellent agreement if we include secular perturbations from massive asteroids , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma_vw ] , panel f. the larger values of @xmath53 obtained when massive asteroids are considered and the agreement with estimates of the gallia family age obtained with independent methods represent , in our opinion , some of the newest and most interesting results of this work .",
    "our results could be summarized as it follows :    1 .",
    "we identified the hansa , barcelona , and gallia families in the domain of proper elements , obtained dynamical maps in the domains of proper @xmath13 and @xmath7 , and mapped the location in the @xmath7 of the three node resonance with ceres , vesta , and pallas .",
    "the hansa and gallia families are crossed by the @xmath60 secular resonances .",
    "all families are s - complex group , all characterized by relatively large values of @xmath53 .",
    "2 .   we obtained age and terminal ejection velocities estimates for the three families using a monte carlo method to simulate the yarkovsky and stochastic yorp evolution in proper @xmath61 of family members . at one sigma confidence level we found that @xmath62 myr , and @xmath63 m / s for the hansa family , @xmath64 myr , and @xmath65 m / s for the barcelona family , and @xmath66 myr , and @xmath67 m / s for the gallia one .",
    "our results are summarized in table  [ table : ghb_ages ] .",
    "3 .   simulated the dynamical evolution of fictitious families with values of the ejection velocity parameters @xmath8 obtained from our previous analysis under the gravitational influence of all planets , the yarkovsky force , and the effect of ceres , vesta , and pallas .",
    "the @xmath53 parameter was computed as a function of time for all simulated family members , and we monitored when its value was comparable to the currently observed ones .",
    "the gallia and , in a less measure , the hansa families were significantly affected by secular resonances with vesta .",
    "current values of @xmath53 for the gallia family could only be reached over the estimated family age if secular resonances with vesta were accounted for .",
    "conversely , secular resonances with main belt massive bodies play no significant role in the evolution of the barcelona family .",
    "independent constraints on the family age can be set by the time behavior of the @xmath53 parameter .",
    "overall , we found that the @xmath53 parameter could be an invaluable tool for providing hints about the relative importance of secular dynamics , and to set constraints on the ages , ejection velocity fields , and key parameters influencing the yarkovsky force , such as the mean density and surface conductivity of @xmath0 leptokurtic families , and could be in principle applied to other similar families identified in @xcite .",
