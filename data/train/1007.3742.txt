    "the high energy range of the cosmic ray ( cr ) spectrum is broken into three parts : the knee - to - ankle segment extends roughly from @xmath6 to @xmath7ev , and the ultrahigh energy cr ( uhecr ) above the ankle can be further segmented into those below the gzk cutoff at about @xmath8ev , and those above it .",
    "those above the ankle are believed to be extragalactic , showing both a flattening of slope in the observed flux , and little anisotropy below the gzk cutoff , and some anisotropy towards the local supercluster above it .",
    "both uhecr components require particle acceleration well beyond the energies at which @xmath1-rays themselves are detected .",
    "the cosmic rays ( cr ) beyond the ankle have been attributed to active galactic nuclei , but this is not the case for cr in the range @xmath9  ev , whose origin remains a mystery . in this energy range ,",
    "cr are probably galactic in origin and do not fill intergalactic space as the cr above the ankle do .",
    "gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) have been considered by some authors ( e.g. levinson and eichler 1993 , milgrom & usov 1995 , waxman 1995 , vietri 1995 ) as sources of uhecr . levinson and eichler ( 1993 ) ,",
    "while not taking a position on whether grbs could account for uhecrs above the ankle ( despite giving this possibility serious consideration ) , suggested tha suggested that those just below are due to galactic grb .",
    "doubts that grb could supply the highest - energy cosmic rays include the total energetics , discussed in this paper , adiabatic losses , which lower the maximum energy should the acceleration be in a compact region , and galactic isotropy , which is discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "later authors ( milgrom & usov 1995 , vietri 1995 , waxman 1995 ) focused on the possible connection between grb and cosmic rays above the gzk cutoff .",
    "grbs have also been considered as sources of uhe neutrinos ( e.g. eichler 1994 , waxman & bahcall 1997 , eichler and levinson , 1999 ) .",
    "levinson and eichler , the detection of uhecr and/or uhe neutrinos in association with grbs would provide valuable information .    in recent years",
    "there have been new and improved data . in particular",
    ", the lat detector on the fermi observatory provides information about the energy in non - thermal tails of particle distributions , and the gamma ray burst monitor ( gbm ) , which can measure energies up to 30 mev , provides a more reliable measurement of the grb bolometric luminosities .",
    "amanda ii has been operational for over 1000 days and has set limits on the neutrino output of grb .",
    "this paper takes another look at grb and uhecr energetics in the context of previous suggestions . in the steady state",
    ", the total demands of local power per unit cosmic volume on sources of uhecr above the ankle , @xmath10 , can be written in terms of the measured allsky uhecr flux in any specified energy range , @xmath11 , as @xmath12 assuming the uhecr fill intergalactic space . here",
    "@xmath13 is the cosmic - ray energy loss time due to interactions with the microwave background .",
    "the quantity @xmath14 is the bolometric correction assuming the source produces a spectrum typical of familiar shock acceleration .",
    "the ratio @xmath15 is thus given by a product of four separate dimensionless numbers .",
    "below , we determine the values of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "we find that for cosmic rays above the ankle , @xmath16 is 4 , @xmath20 is about 2 for popular estimates of cosmic star formation rates , @xmath21 is between 5 and 8 for cr above the ankle , and more for cr above the gzk cutoff , and @xmath19 is between 4 and 20 , depending on assumptions about the acceleration .",
    "altogether , the value of @xmath15 is of order @xmath22 to @xmath23 , despite the fact that each of the four factors may be modest .",
    "the average cosmic energy density in @xmath1-rays from grb is a directly measurable quantity , independent of distracting uncertainties in the beaming angle , average energy , or rate of grb . for a sample of hundreds of grb or more , and spectral coverage from 8 kev on upward , as we now have",
    ", we can measure the total allsky flux in grb merely by summing over all events within a given time interval .",
    "most of the photon energy in grb detected by fermi is in the gbm range .",
    "we have considered all long ( @xmath24 seconds ) bursts detected by the fermi gamma - ray burst monitor from august 2008 until february 2010 ( see table 2 of guetta et al .",
    "the fluences have been collected from the literature ( mainly gcn circulars ) and usually are given in the 8 kev1 mev energy range .",
    "there are @xmath25 grbs with fluences given in the 50 - 300 kev energy range . for grb 080916c , grb 090902b and grb 100116a",
    "the fluences are given up to 10 mev .",
    "there exists the possibility of some additional unreported fluence outside the quoted range , but we presume the quoted range is selected so that the unreported fluence is relatively small .",
    "we have summed the reported grb fluences and found the sum to be @xmath26  erg/@xmath27 .",
    "short bursts , which we do not include here , contributed another several percent .",
    "the gbm field of view ( fov ) is roughly @xmath28 steradians , and we can thus write the total allsky flux as    @xmath29    this is below the [ 10 - 1000 ] kev flux for all grb that would have been derived from batse data by a factor of @xmath30 ( m. schmidt , private communication to v.s .",
    "berezinsky 2002 ; d. eichler and d. guetta , in preparation ) .",
    "in addition to differences in instrumental sensitivity and calibration , some discrepancy may be expected due to year - to - year fluctuations in grb flux , because it receives much of its contribution from the several brightest grb in any given year ( see below ) .",
    "although we continue to use the gbm number , we note that the error in this estimate may be a factor of order 40 percent or so .",
    "the important conclusion is that the 3 - 30 mev energy band , which was not covered by batse , does not appear to contain enough flux to significantly affect our conclusions .",
    "it appears to be less than the flux below 3 mev .",
    "this is consistent with the steep post - peak spectra ",
    "i.e. large band parameter @xmath31  that is seen for many of the bursts .",
    "as most of the grb flux is in relatively bright grb , we can be reasonably confident that no significant flux is hidden in dim , nondetectable grb - unless they form a separate , as yet unidentified , class of events , rather than merely the low - luminosity extension of what has already been identified .",
    "there remains , however , the logical possibility that most grb are dominated by huge grb that are so infrequent that we do not yet have a fair sample of them .",
    "of the 205 long grbs detected by the gamma ray burst monitor before february 2010 , only @xmath32  12 long bursts were detected above 30 mev by the lat telescope .",
    "we have estimated the fluences above 100 mev of 10 grbs detected by lat - hence out of fov of lat , nor grb100116a , as we did nt find its lat fluence ] to be between 5% and 30% of the total gbm fluence .",
    "the sum of the 100 mev to 10 gev fluences in these 10 lat - detected grb is @xmath33  erg/@xmath27 , which is about 13.5% of the total gbm fluence for the same grbs , @xmath34  erg/@xmath27 .",
    "an additional 9 grb were not detected by lat despite being `` lat - eligible '' , i.e. within the lat field of view and as bright as those that _ were _ detected by lat .",
    "their total gbm fluence was @xmath35 erg/@xmath27 , and the upper limit to the lat fluence for these grb was about 5% of the total .",
    "thus , the overall emissivity in the 100 mev to 10 gev range is apparently below 13% of that in the gbm band , which is consistent with the view that grb typically ( though not necessarily always ) emit most of their photon energy in a quasi - thermal mev peak ( e.g. levinson and eichler 2000 , meszaros and rees 2000 , ryde 2004 , ryde and peer 2009 ) .",
    "the total detected lat fluence over 1.5 years corresponds steradians , ] to an allsky flux of    @xmath36    which is about 11% @xmath37 4.5% of the _ total _ inferred all - sky gbm flux , cf .",
    "equation [ el ] .",
    "the error of @xmath38 is estimated on the basis of the fact that more than 70% of the total is dominated by only 3 grb , ( 090902b , 080916c , and 090926a ) . as we include two decades of energy in the above flux , the inferred flux per decade",
    "is @xmath39 .",
    "the fermi gamma ray observatory has a sufficiently large dynamic range of photon energy that it is beginning to provide a basis for comparison with theory of how energy in violent , non - thermal astrophysical events is distributed among radiative particles .",
    "theory predicts power - law particle spectra whose index depends on the compression ratio of the shock .",
    "as the acceleration may be very efficient , the compression ratio may be affected by the particle acceleration itself , so that the problem can become non - linear .",
    "non - linear theory of shock acceleration ( eichler 1979 , eichler 1984 , ellison and eichler 1985 ) predicts that about half of the internal energy of the shocked fluid should be found in the energetic tail and the other half in thermal particles .",
    "the basic reason is that , because the energetic particle distribution must be injected from the thermal pool , some of the compression ( about half as it turns out ) must be saved for viscous heating of the latter , otherwise the injection of fresh particles gets choked off . while the energetic tail receives of order 50% of the total , it is generally distributed over many decades , so that there is only of order @xmath40 per decade or less .",
    "this becomes significant in the interpretation of isolated energy ranges of high - energy emission .",
    "the energy in uhecr is likely to be most of the total only if the spectrum is extremely hard - much harder than the conventionally applied models of shock acceleration - because the uhe range is so many decades above the low - energy cutoff .",
    "the lat fluence , when observed , appears to be only about @xmath41 of the total gbm fluence in the 100 mev-10 gev range , or about @xmath42 per lat decade , which is perhaps less than expected from certain early synchrotron emission models .",
    "the 100 mev10 gev fluences observed by lat may or may not be a good proxy for the total output of uhecr and/or uhe neutrinos . as opposed to the gbm flux , which may represent a thermal pool , the lat fluxes measure the non - thermal tail of the energy distribution in the grb primary",
    "charged particles , which , if hadronic , is the part that could contribute to the uhecr and uhe neutrino fluxes .",
    "however , there still remain the uncertainties of the electron - to - proton ratio , the microscopic details of the injection process , and the optical depth at which the particle acceleration takes place .",
    "it is possible that degradation of high - energy particles and/or photons also contributes to the thermal component .",
    "the point nevertheless remains that maximally efficient shock acceleration over a large range of high energy is generally limited from above by the large number of decades in the overall energy range of the acceleration process , to at most 5 - 10% per decade of particle energy , so it is consistent with the spectra of the lat sources without the need to invoke pair opacity .",
    "this necessitates a considerable bolometric correction , of order @xmath40 , when comparing the total grb flux with cosmic ray energies in a given energy decade .",
    "were pair opacity the only uncertainty , we might reasonably say that the lat flux is a lower limit , and the gbm flux is an upper limit , but this upper limit would include three decades in the gbm range , plus @xmath43 , the number of decades in the range subject to pair opacity .",
    "as the total gbm flux is only 20 times the lat flux per decade , the upper limit and lower limits so obtained would be rather close together .",
    "in our view , the main uncertainties in using lat fluence as a proxy for uhecr output are the uncertainty in the electron - to - proton ratio and the possibility that only electrons contribute to the lat @xmath1-rays .",
    "relativistic shocks can accelerate charged particles , and , in the case of efficient stochastic scattering a spectral index of -2.3 is generally predicted ( kirk and schneider 1987 , bednarz and ostrowski 1998 ) . because the energy spectrum is convergent at high energy ,",
    "it need not affect the compression ratio .",
    "it follows that only a small fraction @xmath44^{-0.3}$ ] of the relativistic shock s energy budget can be apportioned to the highest decade of the energy range .",
    "we conclude that the measured lat fluxes are consistent with maximally efficient shock acceleration , if the gbm is interpreted as a thermal particle peak or as a catch - basin for pair cascade end products .",
    "they are also consistent with the @xmath45 spectra expected from relativistic shocks , since they lie nearly 3 orders of magnitude above the thermal peak and contain about 10% of the total flux .",
    "another important energy reservoir for grb is the kinetic energy of the blast , @xmath46 , which is the ultimate source of shock energy for producing uhecr . as the proton - to - electron efficiency ratio @xmath47",
    ", the proton to prompt - gamma - ray efficiency ratio @xmath48 , and the blast energy to prompt @xmath1-ray efficiency ratio @xmath49 could each conceivably be large , no constraint can rigorously be placed on the proton energy budget from @xmath1-rays , so the latter could come from inverse comptonizing electrons .",
    "afterglow calorimetry models ( frail et al . 1997 , waxman et al . 1998 , freedman and waxman , 2001 ) typically put @xmath50 , but see eichler and waxman ( 2005 ) , and below . also , eichler and jontof - hutter ( 2005 ) argue on the basis of correlation between @xmath51 ( as derived from afterglow calorimetry ) and spectral peak , that @xmath52 is in fact nearly an order of magnitude below previous estimates , and this is supported by the detailed analysis by vergani et al .",
    "( 2008 ) of grb 060418 .",
    "simulations of relativistic shocks typically give @xmath53 ( spitkovsky 2008 ) , but , as shocks responsible for uhecr are more likely to be non - relativistic , this result may not apply .",
    "the possibility that @xmath54 is much larger than the @xmath1-ray output @xmath55 , necessary to make the grb - uhecr connection , is not consistent with many claims that @xmath56 , but we can not rule it out , as there remains the possibility that the injection of electrons into the diffusive shock acceleration process is of low efficiency ( eichler and waxman 2005 ) .    in figure 1 , we adopt the star formation rate ( sfr ) @xmath57 where @xmath58^{1/2}/(1+z)^{3/2}\\ ] ] with @xmath59 , @xmath60 ( porciani & madau 2001 ) , and , for comparison , that of hopkins and beacom ( 2006 , 2008 ) , which gives very similar results . assuming the grb energy input rate @xmath61 scales as @xmath62 , we plot the expected energy contribution per unit time of grb to the present cosmic energy density @xmath63 as a function of redshift . in the second frame ,",
    "we calculate the cumulative contribution at redshift less than z , @xmath64[dt / dz]dz } { \\int^{z(t)}_{0}[\\dot w(z)/(1+z)][dt / dz]dz}=\\frac{\\int^{z}_{0}[\\dot w_{\\gamma}(z)/(1+z)][dt / dz]dz } { f_{\\gamma}/c},\\ ] ] where @xmath65  gyr .",
    "both sfr give a present day value for @xmath66 of @xmath67 the present day energy input from grb in the gbm range is thus given by @xmath68 which may be somewhat below some previous estimates .",
    "such a difference would appear if grb with known afterglows are systematically brighter than those with unknown afterglow , for it is the former group that is the basis for estimating the typical isotropic equivalent energies of grb .",
    "this is connected to the claim ( nakar and piran , 2005 , band and preece , 2005 ) that grb with unknown redshift are less energetic on the average , even if placed at a very high redshift , than those of known redshift , which are reported to lie on the amati relation . on the other hand , schmidt ( 2002 , private communication to v.s .",

    "the uncertainty lies in the instrumental energy calibration and in the location of the high energy cutoff .    if most of the trans - gzk cr are heavy nuclei , as suggested by recent analysis of auger data , ( abraham et al . , 2010b ) , then their production is limited to an even smaller lookback time ( stecker and salamon , 1999 ) , and the uhecr production demanded of individual grb would be raised accordingly .",

    "we also consider the energy per decade inferred from the fermi lat detections in the energy decades 100 mev to 10 gev as the basis for a representative estimate of the amount of the energy per decade that could be expected for uhecr and uhe neutrinos at even higher energies .",

    "for example , the gbm flux , which appears to have a quasithermal spectrum peaking around 1 mev , may be the catch - basin of all of the radiation that was converted into pairs .",
    "for grb unseen by lat , this can be as much as all the fireball energy . in cases where the grb is detected by lat ,",
    "the observed gbm - to - lat flux ratio is consistent with the assumption that shock acceleration could put at most of order @xmath117 of its energy budget at any given decade well beyond the thermal peak of cosmic - ray energy .",
    "we tentatively make the conventional best - case assumption for shock acceleration [ tentatively leaving aside the extreme case of negligible phase velocity , ( ellison and eichler , 1985 ) ] that the spectral index is -2.0 , which represents a spectral distribution of equal energy per decade of individual particle energy .    altogether , assuming @xmath118 , and combining it with @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121",

    ". this might give a source spectrum that is much harder than the post - shock spectrum .",
    "however , this does not seem to be the case for supernova remnants ( snr ) , if they are the source of low energy cr , as the galactic energy budget in cr is only about 3% of the energy budget of snr .",
    "rather , it would seem that adiabatic losses of uhecr ( which we have not included ) would exacerbate the bolometric correction .",
    "there are ways in the literature to get a very hard spectrum . this does not , however , lessen the energy requirement above 4 eev , which still challenges the hypothesis of a grb origin for uhecr .",
    "other `` ultrahard '' acceleration scenarios exist for baryonic acceleration in grb which could produce much harder spectra than shock acceleration . in the neutron pick - up scenario ( eichler and levinson , 1999 , levinson and eichler , 2003 ) , neutrons that leak out of the surrounding matter into the fireball",

    "the number of neutrino events per year allowed in icecube from grb is limited by the lack of neutrino events in amanda correlating with grb .",
    "amanda ii has had @xmath143 years of live observing time from 2000 through 2007 , and has an effective collection area of about 1/20 of icecube 80 ( de young , et al . , 2008 ) . despite the differences in the spectral response of icecube and amanda , and the varying availability of the contemporaneous grb monitoring needed to eliminate blind searches , the failure to identify a single neutrino event in amanda associated with known grb ( achterberg et al .",
    "2008 ) limits ( to modest confidence ) the expected grb contribution to the icecube detection rate to @xmath144 events per year , unless the neutrinos are a ) out of the @xmath1-ray beam ( eichler and levinson , 1999 ) or b ) dominated by large episodic events more than a year or two apart .",
    "[ a @xmath145 confidence limit would be n times higher . ]",
    "this limit corresponds to a uhe neutrino flux per energy decade of less than @xmath146 erg/@xmath27/yr .",
    "this is less than @xmath147 of the cumulative energy density , @xmath71}/c\\eta(0.2)$ ] , that must have been put into uhecrs in the 4 - 40 eev range to maintain the observed @xmath71}$ ] , and about @xmath148 of that needed to maintain the observed trans - gzk flux , @xmath149 .",
    "this would then rule out models in which grbs produce the uhecrs in region in regions of moderate to high optical depth to hadronic interactions and subsequent photons , unless the uhecr energy spectrum is harder than @xmath4 in the @xmath150 ev range .",
    "note that this limit does not apply to `` orphan '' neutrinos from obscured or otherwise unseen grb ( eichler and levinson 1999 ) as there is no associated grb to which to `` pin '' the neutrino burst .",
    "collimation of fireballs within the envelope of host stars , now believed to almost certainly take place , would naturally lead to wider neutrino beams than the @xmath1-ray beams if there is proton acceleration at collimation shocks .",
    "similarly , shocks in an accompanying baryonic outflow ( levinson and eichler 1993 ) may produce a wide neutrino beam while accompanying @xmath1-rays are stopped .",
    "there may eventually be `` @xmath1-quiet '' ways to confirm that a uhe neutrino is associated with a grb ( eichler and levinson 1999 , guetta and eichler 2010 ) .",
    "for example , an orphan photon afterglow is detectable within several days , and , at @xmath151 tev , the atmospheric background within the icecube angular resolution , less than 1 per square degree per year , is unlikely to cause confusion .     as noted early on ( eichler , 1994 ) ,",
    "_ individual grb _ are unlikely to produce more than one neutrino count unless they are exceptionally energetic to the extent of being rare , and this is important for _ prospective _ identification of he muon / neutrino events with grb .",
    "the brightest individual lat fluence was @xmath152erg/@xmath27 , which would correspond to an expected neutrino fluence of about 0.2 by the above estimation procedure , and this is consistent with the assumption that several percent of grb - related neutrinos would arrive paired , which is important for follow - up searches for paired neutrinos ( franckowiak et al , 2009 ) .",
    "however , the 0.1 to 0.2 probability applies only to the four brightest examples .",
    "the average for the 19 lat - eligible long grb , on the other hand , was limited from above by @xmath153erg/@xmath27 , which would imply a pairing fraction less than 1/19 .",
    "the number of expected neutrino pairs from grb , if lat fluences are used as a basis for estimate , is thus less than 1/yr , though obviously uncertain . because neutrino pairs from grb are ( under reasonable assumptions ) probably rare , as discussed above , we suggest therefore that single he and uhe neutrino counts in icecube be subjected to follow up searches for `` sibling '' orphan afterglows- for example , with robotic telescopes and/or high energy cuts . the selection criteria for choosing a tractable set of single events to be followed up",
    "is a non - trivial matter , but a high energy threshold seems to be one obvious approach .",
    "27 2004 flare from the soft @xmath1-ray repeater sgr 1806 - 20 , which , at a fluence of about 1 erg/@xmath27 , produced the equivalent of 250 years of grb prompt - emission fluence , did not register in amanda ii , and the limit this sets on neutrino fluence to @xmath1-ray fluence ratio is @xmath154 ( achterberg et al .",
    "present - day understanding of grb , which may ( or may not ) be sufficiently similar to giant sgr outbursts to make the analogy , is thus compatible with ( but does not imply ) a signal of less than @xmath155 uhe neutrino events in icecube per year from grbs .",
    "we find that the prompt emission and total afterglow emission from grb produce a cosmic energy density that is two to three orders of magnitude below that ascribed to processes that yield ultrahigh - energy cosmic rays .",
    "this estimate assumes that uhecr are generated with an @xmath4 spectrum . for even a slightly steeper spectrum , the difference between the implied uhecr energy input and the grb photon energy input is even larger .",
    "it applies to the net production of uhecr after adiabatic losses .",
    "such losses are to some extent inevitable for shock acceleration , which relies on compression of trapped particles , but the degree to which they affect the uhe output has not , to our knowledge , been calculated . the total lat flux from grb",
    ", if it is of hadronic origin and if grb generate , in uhe neutrinos in the 1 to 100 tev range , the same energy per decade as what lat detects in high energy @xmath1-rays , implies a neutrino rate of about 2 events per year in icecube .",
    "based on the fact that the overall gbm flux is mostly from the brightest grb , there is a good chance that these neutrinos would mostly correlate with the small minority of bright grb rather than one of the much larger number of dim grb .",
    "fermi can directly observe @xmath1-rays from grb up to about 100 gev beyond which an undetected additional component from , e.g. , inverse compton scattering , could hide .",
    "direct limits on tev band emission ( aharonian et al .",
    "2009 ) from grb are not constraining on account of severe absorption by pair production in intergalactic space , but the pair production will feed an electromagnetic cascade that transports the radiation energy into the 10100 gev band , where it would appear as extragalactic background .",
    "recent fermi measurements of that background indicate that the intensity in the 10 - 100 gev band is about @xmath156 ( abdo et al .",
    "2010 ) , or an allsky flux of @xmath157 .",
    "this can be compared to the implied full - sky flux of @xmath158 that is implied by equation ( 4 ) when the entire energy in a e@xmath159 spectrum from 100 gev to trans - gzk energies is cascaded into the 10100 gev band .",
    "this means that , whatever the origin of uhecr , a significant fraction of them _ may _ have undergone high energy collisions .",
    "this admits , for _ non - grb _ scenarios of uhecr origin , the `` thick target '' scenario - that much or most of the uhe particle acceleration in the universe is buried at large optical depths , and that the uhe electromagnetic radiation we observe , even in a particular episodic event , is just the part that stands out at modest optical depth .",
    "the diffuse 10 - 100 gev @xmath1-ray background would , by itself , admit much larger uhe neutrino fluxes , up to @xmath160 icecube events per year , even if the associated photons escape the acceleration site .",
    "although we have attempted careful estimates of what is known , the overwhelming uncertainty in the above discussion is the spectral index of the cosmic rays which we have taken as @xmath4 for reference .",
    "the uhecr and neutrino outputs , whose relevant energies are much higher than those of the @xmath1-rays observed so far , are so sensitive to the spectral index as to render relatively minor the other considerations that we can discuss with some degree of knowledge .    the other chief uncertainty is the optical depth at which hadronic particle acceleration takes place . if most of it is at high optical depth , the uhe - neutrino signal should be relatively strong .",
    "however , the amanda limits on grb - associated uhe neutrinos are relevant for any optical depth .",
    "the main conclusions to be drawn are :    \\a ) identification of ultrahigh - energy cosmic rays in association with grb would mean that grb put more than @xmath161 times as much energy into uhe cosmic rays above the ankle in the uhecr spectrum as into all @xmath1-rays .",
    "if the spectral index of accelerated particles is -2 , then they put about @xmath22 to @xmath162 times as much energy into cosmic rays over the full spectral range . in view of the large energy requirements for the latter possibility ,",
    "such a result , should it come to pass , could be interpreted as evidence for ultrahard uhe hadronic acceleration scenarios within the grb , as well as a huge baryonic blast wave component .",
    "\\b ) the hypothesis of a grb origin for uhecr by processes occurring over a range of optical depths that includes moderate to high optical depth for the uhecr would need to confront the non - detection by amanda ii of any grb - associated neutrinos .",
    "c ) prospective searches for supernovae or grb signatures with single neutrino events in icecube are motivated by the chance that doublet events will be too rare .",
