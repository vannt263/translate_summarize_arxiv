    "the x - ray transient source  ( also known as x - ray nova scorpii 1994 ) was discovered with batse on the compton gamma ray observatory on 27 july 1994 .",
    "the evolution of the hard ( 20100 kev ) x - ray intensity during the subsequent 5 months has been discussed by harmon et al .",
    "three outbursts were observed , each characterized by a fast ( @xmath2 day ) rise to a level of 600700 mcrab in the 20100 kev range , with no well - defined single maximum during the outbursts ( 1050 days ) .",
    "typical peak flux levels were @xmath3 in the energy range of the observations .",
    "there was no significant emission from the location of for a 50 day period prior to 27 july .",
    "is a nearby ( 23 kpc ) dynamical black - hole candidate with a reported mass function of @xmath4 ( bailyn et al .",
    "1995a , b ; see tanaka & lewin 1995 for a recent review of black - hole candidates ) .",
    "the source shows strong radio outbursts associated with superluminal expansion events ( tingay et al . 1995 ; hjellming & rupen 1995 ) that are correlated with the increase in hard x - ray flux .",
    "bailyn et al .",
    "( 1995b ) found that the optical light curve shows eclipses , at an orbital period of 2.6 days , and suggested that the orbital inclination of  is close to 90@xmath5 .",
    "the energy spectrum can be well described by a power law out to at least 300 kev , with spectral ( photon ) index varying between 2.5 and 3.1 ( wilson et al .",
    "1995 ) .    here",
    "we report on the analysis of the fast variability of the hard x - ray intensity of . in section 2",
    "we describe the observations and data analysis .",
    "we discuss our results in section 3 .",
    "section 4 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "we used the 1.024 second time resolution count rates from the batse large area detectors ( lads ) in 2 energy channels corresponding to the energy range 2050 and ( fishman et al .",
    "intervals were selected of 512 time bins ( 524.288 seconds ) without interruptions or data drop - outs , during which  was above the earth horizon .",
    "our chosen segment length is a compromise between the number of contiguous segments that could be obtained ( this is determined by incomplete data coverage , and saa passages ) and frequency resolution .",
    "we used data only from detectors in which the source was seen at an angle of @xmath6 from the detector normal .",
    "the segments were quadratically detrended , the resulting time series converted to power density spectra ( pds ) , and the pds averaged over an entire day .",
    "approximately 45 intervals were obtained each day during the outbursts . we have determined that for the purposes of this analysis quadratic detrending is equivalent to a detailed background model subtraction as described by rubin et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . using similar intervals obtained when",
    "the source was occulted by the earth ( approximately 29 per day ) we verified that the pds of the detector background counting rate is flat down to at least 0.03 hz .",
    "the data set that we could use is constrained by the presence of other potential noise sources in the field of view of the uncollimated lad detectors that are facing .",
    "cygnus  x-1 is a persistent source that shows strong variability in the frequency interval of interest . because of the large angle ( @xmath7 ) between cygnus  x-1 and , it is possible to choose detectors that face  in which cygnus  x-1 is at an angle @xmath8 from the detector normal .",
    "only these detectors have been used in the following analysis .",
    "the soft x - ray transient source ( located within @xmath9 of ) was found from the source monitoring by batse through daily occultation analysis ( harmon et al .",
    "1993 ) to be bright during the second and third outburst of .",
    "we have therefore confined our observations to the 15 days corresponding to the first outburst when no other sources in the vicinity of  were detected with batse at a level higher than @xmath10 , and when the daily averaged flux of  was higher than @xmath11 ( 28 july 199411 august 1994 ) .",
    "figure  1 shows the flux levels for this interval ( harmon et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the analysis is complicated by the existence of background noise in the lad detectors that is likely due to weak unresolved sources in the uncollimated field of view .",
    "figure 2 shows the power levels normalized to a poisson level of 2.0 ( leahy et al .  1983 ) , and averaged over the frequency interval in detectors facing the region of  for 16 days prior to the outburst . during this period",
    ", no transient sources with a hard spectrum and known fast variability were detected with batse in this region having a flux greater than @xmath12 ( 20100 kev ) .",
    "the 16 day average of the ( 0.030.488 hz ) power density is @xmath13 .",
    "figure 3 shows the averaged pds for  during the interval 28 july 1994 to 11 august 1994 , corrected for the background noise effect described above .",
    "the power density was normalized to represent the squared fractional r.m.s .",
    "amplitude per unit frequency ( see van der klis 1995 for the formulae ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the ( 0.030.488 hz ) integrated daily averaged pds measured from , where the pds have been normalized in the same way as in figure 3 .",
    "the errors have been propagated from the variance per bin calculated for each daily average , the errors in the subtracted background power , and the count rate errors derived from occultation analysis .",
    "the average value of this squared fractional r.m.s .",
    "amplitude equals @xmath14 ( r.m.s./mean)@xmath15 ; the @xmath16 upper limit to this quantity equals @xmath17 . the corresponding @xmath16 upper limit to the fractional r.m.s .",
    "amplitude , @xmath18 , averaged over the 15 days of observation equals @xmath19 .",
    "based on their spectral and fast - variability properties , it appears that the black - hole x - ray binaries have three states , the low , high and very high states ( miyamoto et al .",
    "1994 ; van der klis 1994a ) .",
    "the high state is characterized by the presence of a strong ultrasoft component which dominates the 110 kev x - ray flux .",
    "since no low - energy x - ray observations were made during the period covered by our study , we can not make a statement on the source state of   on the basis of its spectral characteristics .",
    "in the low state the x - ray spectra of black - hole x - ray binaries are very hard , and well described by a power law that extends up to several hundreds of kev .",
    "the pds is characterized by a power law at high frequencies , with an approximately flat part below a variable break frequency @xmath20 . in pds that are normalized according to belloni & hasinger ( 1990 ) the high - frequency part of the pds does not change much ; therefore , @xmath18 , in a given frequency interval that contains the break frequency , is anticorrelated with @xmath20 .",
    "if  had been in the low state during our observations , and followed the ( @xmath21 ) relation of cygnus  x-1 ( van der klis 1994b ; crary et al .",
    "1995 ) the break frequency would have to be at least @xmath22 hz , to account for the observed upper limit to @xmath18 of 6.6% . the required extrapolation of @xmath20 beyond the range observed for cygnus  x-1 ( 0.04 to 0.4 hz ) seems moderate enough that we can not exclude that  was in the low state during our observations .",
    "the high state of black - hole x - ray binaries is characterized by the presence of a strong ultra - soft spectral component , which dominates the flux in the 110 kev range . in the high state",
    "an anticorrelation is observed between the 210 kev source variability and spectral hardness , which has been interpreted as a dilution of the variability in the hard power law spectral component by the less variable ultrasoft component .",
    "no information on the presence or absence of an ultrasoft component in the x - ray spectrum of  during our observation is available . if we assume that the total luminosity of  does not exceed the eddington limit , then with the distance of 3.5 kpc ( bailyn et al .",
    "1995a ) and mass of at least 3.35 m@xmath23 we find that there is ample room for an ultrasoft component ( the 2100 kev luminosity in the power law component is only one third of the eddington limit ) .",
    "we can not , therefore , exclude that  was then in the high state .",
    "if it were , the low value of @xmath18 we have observed would indicate that the variability of the hard ( 20 - 100 kev ) power law spectral component is smaller in the high state than in the low state .",
    "this , in turn , would suggest that the low values of @xmath18 observed in the 2 - 10 kev band in the high state is not only the result of the above mentioned dilution by the ultrasoft component , but that the variability of the power law component in this energy range is low as well .",
    "the very high state ( vhs ) has so far only been observed in two sources , gs  1124@xmath2468 ( miyamoto et al .",
    "1993 ) and gx  339@xmath244 ( miyamoto et al .  1992 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum then has , at least part of the time , a power law component above 20 kev .",
    "miyamoto et al .  ( 1994 ) have decomposed the pds obtained with ginga for gs  1124@xmath2468 in the vhs into a power law component and a flat - topped component .",
    "the latter has a constant value of @xmath25 for frequencies below 1 hz , and is independent of energy in the 137 kev range .",
    "this pds level corresponds to a value for @xmath18 in the frequency range 0.030.488 hz of 3% .",
    "if we assume that the energy independence of the pds in the vhs extends throughout the batse energy range , the observed variability properties of , presented here are consistent with the idea that the source was in the vhs during our observations .",
    "during the first outburst of  we detected no ( 0.030.488 hz ) variability in its ( 20100 kev ) flux , with an upper limit to its r.m.s .",
    "amplitude of 6.6% ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "several bright ( @xmath27 crab , 20100 kev ) black - hole candidate sources observed with batse ( in particular , cygnus x-1 , , and gro  j0422 + 32 ) have shown enhanced noise power in the 0.030.488 hz range , and occasional quasi - periodic oscillations ( kouveliotou 1994 ; van der hooft et al .",
    "fractional r.m.s .",
    "values for this noise observed from cygnus  x-1 ( 1030% , crary et al .",
    "1995 ) and  ( @xmath28 , van der hooft et al .",
    "1995 ) are characteristic of the low state ( van der klis 1994 ) , and it is likely that they were encountered in that state with batse .    based on the batse data for the period july 28august 11 , 1994 alone we can not interpret the observed low variability of  in terms of the source state scheme for black - hole candidates .",
    "for that a better understanding of the hard x - ray properties of black - hole candidates ( e.g. , their spectral slope ) in the different source states is required .",
    "investigations of this type will be facilitated by low - energy ( @xmath29 kev ) observations , performed concurrently with a batse observation .",
