    "many important characteristics of open systems can be missed by not accounting for the non - equilibrium dynamics that stems from their time - dependent ( td ) parameters .",
    "additionally , the application of the km to many problems would move closer to reality by allowing for the natural frequency of each oscillator , or the coupling strengths , to be externally modulated by td forcing , as commonly occurs in living systems . among the numerous collective rhythms",

    ". additionally , similar considerations are to be expected in non - biological examples such as pattern formation in a nonlinear medium far from equilibrium @xcite . here , using trapped ions , one can vary the parameters at will and see the effect on the synchronization .    there has already been much work on coupled oscillators influenced by noise as a special form of external dynamics @xcite . likewise , driving by an external periodic force @xcite is a long - explored model , characterized by the interplay to the phases of each oscillator between the external pacemaker and the mean field of all other oscillators .",
    "a generalization of the km that allowed certain time - varying frequencies and couplings was also numerically explored in @xcite .",
    "however , the simulations were performed over a very small number of oscillators , the dynamics were not described analytically , and a qualitative description was not given for slow or fast varying cases .",
    "other studies of non - constant collective rhythms include asymmetrically - coupled ensembles @xcite and populations with multimodally distributed natural frequencies @xcite , with their complex mean field being a result of multimodal distribution of the parameters .",
    "frequency adaptation as discussed in @xcite assumes non - constant natural frequencies , but without external influence .",
    "it is similar to the models with inertia @xcite and its dynamics , apart from the stable incoherence , are characterized by either synchronization or bistable regime of both synchronized and incoherent states .",
    "in addition , the model with drifting frequencies @xcite assumes frequency dynamics formulated as an ornstein - uhlenbeck process , but it also leads to time - independent mean fields , resembling the simple km under influence of colored noise .",
    "alternately - switching connectivity @xcite or periodic couplings @xcite , are some of examples with varying coupling strengths . yet ,",
    "most of the discussions in these are concerned with the networks and graph theory properties of the system , and only heaviside step functions are considered for the interaction between oscillators .",
    "nevertheless , the td mean fields in most of these models result either from multistability or from unstable equilibria . despite this , even in the cases where it stems from some external system @xcite , the low - dimensional mean field dynamics and",
    "slow / fast reduced approaches are still missing .",
    "as such , none of these models can fully demonstrate the deterministic and stable td dynamics of many real physical , chemical , biological , or social systems that can never be completely isolated from their surroundings .",
    "these systems do not reach equilibrium but , instead , exhibit complex dynamical behavior that includes the td frequencies and couplings .",
    "we will show that our generalization of the kuramoto model encompasses these dynamics .",

    "the one to one correspondence between the fixed and td parameters in terms of pdfs implies that the same number of oscillators can be described by either of the following pdfs @xmath25 or @xmath26 and @xmath27 if @xmath28 and @xmath29 are used for describing the population .",
    "also , the infinitesimal number of oscillators @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 where pdfs @xmath32 and @xmath33 give the proportion of oscillators with phase @xmath21 at time @xmath22 , for given fixed @xmath23 and @xmath24 , or fixed @xmath23 and td @xmath34 respectively .",

    "the chosen probability density function @xmath32 is then normalized as @xmath40 moreover in the @xmath41 parameter space the number of oscillators given by @xmath42 for each natural frequency @xmath23 and strength @xmath24 of the forcing @xmath0 is conserved , and only phases @xmath21 change with time .",

    "the former is shown only for simple periodic forcing , but this does not decrease the generality of the reduction , since any external field can be represented by its fourier components .",
    "these methods are of great importance in modeling systems with multiple time - scales of oscillation and interaction , such as the human cardiovascular system @xcite , or inhibitory neurons in the cortex @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we have characterised a new dynamics of interacting oscillators subject to continuous , deterministic perturbation .",
    "it consists of the dynamics of an external system superimposed on the original collective rhythm and was missing from earlier models @xcite , possibly leading to an incorrect interpretation of some real dynamical systems .",
    "we have derived the impact of the forcing and evaluated the effect of its dynamics , amplitude and distribution .",
    "thus , we have proposed a generalization of the kuramoto model that encompasses na systems @xcite and is directly applicable to any thermodynamically open system .",
    "for example , the observed time - variations of brain dynamics can be easily explained as a consequence of td frequencies or couplings of the single neurons , where the source of the external variation could be due to anaesthesia @xcite , event - related @xcite , or due to some influence from another part of the brain . in particular , the stable , time - varying mean field can now be reconstructed and , in this way , a large range of systems tackled by the kuramoto model  spanning from a single cell up to the level of brain dynamics  can be described more realistically .",
