    "ultra cold atomic gases have been shown to be ideal candidates to observe several intrinsically quantum phenomena , since they can be easily controlled and manipulated by electromagnetic fields .",
    "what type of quantum phenomena we can observe depends dramatically on the strength of the atomic interaction , going from one particle phenomena to highly entangled quantum states .",
    "the first experimental highlight with these systems was the achievement of bose - einstein condensation of weakly interacting atomic gases @xcite .",
    "this success motivated a lot of experimental and theoretical work with cold bosons in the limit of weak interactions . in this",
    "regime atoms essentially occupy the same single particle state , and the physics of the system is perfectly understood via a gross - pitaievski equation for the macroscopic wave function .",
    "many interesting phenomena have been studied in this regime and there still exist certain open questions @xcite .    on the other hand , it seems clear that going in the direction of strongly correlated atoms , and exploring what happens beyond the validity of mean field theory , promises to open a new path to the observation of novel physical phenomena .",
    "strong correlations between particles have been shown to lead to unusual fascinating effects in condensed matter systems . in the same way , if an atomic system is driven into the strongly interacting regime , similar interesting phenomena may be observed . moreover , since atomic gases can be well controlled and manipulated , they may provide us with new scenarios for the observation of these phenomena and , perhaps , new ones that have not been accessible so far in solid state environments .",
    "the difficulty here is , however , how to drive an atomic system into a strongly interacting regime . in order to enter this regime",
    "one should make the typical interaction energy larger than any other ( single particle ) energy scale in the problem .",
    "naively speaking , it may seem that the easiest way to do this would be just to increase the interaction strength , either by increasing the scattering length or the atomic density .",
    "however , though the scattering length can be effectively enlarged by using feshbach resonances @xcite , and the atoms squeezed to increase the density , both methods may lead to undesirable instabilities in the system .    alternatively , in order to make interactions to dominate , one can decrease the single particle energies by creating degeneracies . here",
    ", one possibility is to use internal levels , as in the recent proposal to entangle atomic beams by generation of spin - squeezed states @xcite .",
    "degeneracies can also be induced by using a periodic external potential , since single particle states corresponding to different wells will have the same energy . in the limit",
    "in which the amplitude of tunneling between wells is small compared to the typical interaction energy , the system has been predicted to undergo a transition from a superfluid phase to a mott insulator phase @xcite , which is highly correlated .",
    "this quantum phase transition has been recently achieved experimentally in an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "another way of achieving a quasi - degeneracy in the atomic motional states is to rotate the trap that confines the atoms .",
    "when the frequency of rotation is small compared to the frequency of the trap , the system forms a vortex condensate , with a number of vortices that increases as the rotation becomes faster @xcite .",
    "this vortex condensate is a non  correlated state , in which all the atoms occupy the same single particle quantum state .",
    "however , when the rotation frequency is close to the harmonic trap frequency the system has been predicted to enter a _ fractional quantum hall regime _ , in which the atoms are strongly correlated @xcite .",
    "the ground state is a @xmath3laughlin state , a highly entangled liquid with nearly uniform density .",
    "this atomic liquid offers the fascinating possibility of creating and manipulating anyons with @xmath3fractional ",
    "statistics @xcite . by piercing the system with off resonant localized lasers , @xmath3laughlin quasiholes may be created and manipulated to probe directly their fractional statistics . for the fractional quantum hall regime to be experimentally achieved in current rotating traps one would need bosonic gases consisting of a small number of atoms , a limit that has remained practically unexplored .",
    "a particularly interesting exception is a recent experiment with an optical lattice @xcite , that has achieved a regime in which a few number of atoms are confined in each well of the lattice .",
    "since the two - dimensional rotating realization of this lattice may be accessible in near future experiments , further theoretical investigation in the physics of small rotating bosonic gases is highly motivated .    in this paper",
    "we extend the results of our previous work @xcite on a rapidly rotating gas of bosonic atoms , to the case in which the atoms have an internal degree of freedom .",
    "we will show that the addition of internal levels introduces new aspects of the problem , and novel exotic correlated phases come out .",
    "the problem of strongly interacting bosons with spin in a rapidly rotating trap is , in principle , very difficult to tackle ; in particular it is not easy to guess what type of ground states and excitations appear . in this work we present a formalism , what we call _ fermionization _ of the bosonic system , within which the problem takes a very simple form .",
    "we will show that in the limit of rapid rotation and small temperatures , the problem of interacting bosons maps exactly onto a problem of non - interacting fermions .",
    "the ground state corresponds to a fermi sea in which the fermions fill up the single particle states in order of increasing energy .",
    "furthermore , the lowest energy excitations consist of fermion - hole excitations in the vicinity of the fermi level .",
    "the spectrum of the real bosonic system is identical to the one of the effective non - interacting fermions , with the same eigenvalues and the same density of states .",
    "the fermionization scheme is valid for any number of particles @xmath4 and any number of internal states @xmath5 , provided that the atomic interaction does not depend on the internal states of the atoms .",
    "perhaps the most interesting states appear whenever the ratio @xmath6 is an integer number .",
    "the effective fermions then form an integer quantum hall state with filling factor @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding bosonic state is a fractional quantum hall liquid with filling factor @xmath8 .",
    "this fractional liquid is a multicomponent state made out of @xmath5 copies of a @xmath9laughlin ",
    "liquid @xcite , one for each internal state .",
    "thus , by increasing the number of internal states we can go beyond @xmath10 , and lead the system into new fractions in the sequence @xmath11 . all type of anyons @xcite with statistics @xmath12 , @xmath13 can now be created by choosing the adequate spin degeneracy and inserting lasers with a polarization and frequencies which couple to a given atomic internal state ( spin component ) .",
    "an exotic situation appears when the number of internal states equals the number of atoms in the trap .",
    "the effective fermions form in this case a pure spinor state with no spatial dependence .",
    "the corresponding bosonic state is then the product of a completely antisymmetric spin state and a @xmath2 laughlin state , which is fully antisymmetric too .",
    "this means that as long as the spin degrees of freedom are not excited the behaviour of the system will be fermionic .",
    "we will show that the elementary excitations of the systems are true fermions with fermionic statistics , though the real components of the system are bosons .",
    "the formalism of fermionization that we present in this work can be also applied to explore several interesting possibilities .",
    "a very attractive one consists of inducing pairing in the effective fermions , so that they form a superconducting state .",
    "we will show that this is in fact possible when the atomic interaction depends on the internal state .",
    "we will consider the case of atoms with two internal levels when the interaction between atoms in the same spin state is much stronger than the one between atoms in a different spin state .",
    "we will see that the effective fermions configurate in pairs , forming a paired state identical to the bcs state of electrons with spin triplet p  wave pairing .",
    "the corresponding bosonic state , a pfaffian state , is very well known in the context of the quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we develop the fermionization scheme that maps the problem of interacting bosons in a rapid rotating trap onto one of non - interacting fermions . using this formalism",
    "we show in section iii that , when the ratio @xmath6 is an integer number , the ground state of the system is a @xmath8 fractional quantum hall liquid .",
    "starting with these correlated liquids , we show how to create anyons with @xmath14 fractional statistics , with @xmath15 .",
    "we also discuss a possible experiment to reveal directly the statistics of anyons in a ramsey - type interferometer . in section",
    "iv we study the special situation in which @xmath16 . in section",
    "v we illustrate the results of the preceeding sections with some numerical exact diagonalizations for @xmath17 particles .",
    "the experimental conditions required to observe the fractional quantum hall states and the anyons described in this work are analyzed in section vi .",
    "as an example of the interesting possibilities of the fermionization scheme we show in section vii how pairing in the effective fermions can be induced in a system of atoms with two internal levels .",
    "finally , in section viii we summarize the results of this work , and discuss a possible scenario to observe the fractional quantum hall states and the anyons .",
    "we consider a set of @xmath4 bosonic atoms confined in a potential which rotates in the @xmath18 plane at a frequency @xmath19 .",
    "the atoms have an internal degree of freedom , that we will call spin , which can take @xmath20 values .",
    "we will assume that the confinement in the @xmath21 direction is sufficiently strong so that we can ignore the excitations in that direction , and we will consider that the resulting potential in two dimensions is isotropic and harmonic .",
    "the hamiltonian describing this situation in a frame rotating with the trap is : @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the @xmath21 component of the angular momentum of the @xmath24th atom , and where we have used the trap energy , @xmath25 , as the unit of energy , and @xmath26 as the unit of length .",
    "the atoms are interacting via an effective contact potential , with an interacting coupling constant @xmath27 related to the @xmath28wave scattering length , @xmath29 , and to the localization length in the @xmath21 direction , @xmath30 , by @xmath31 . in most parts of this paper",
    "we will also assume that the interaction between the atoms is spin independent .",
    "following our previous work @xcite we begin by writing the hamiltonian ( [ h2d ] ) in the following form : @xmath32 here , @xmath33 is the quantum hall single particle hamiltonian , whose single particle energy levels are the landau levels equally spaced by the cyclotron energy @xmath34 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath35 is proportional to the @xmath21 component of the total angular momentum , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the interaction term .    from now on",
    "we consider the _ rapid rotation limit _ , in which the energy scales characterizing hamiltonians @xmath38 and @xmath37 are much larger than the one corresponding to @xmath39 . in this limit",
    "the ground state and elementary excitations of the system must lie on the subspace @xmath40 of common zero energy eigenstates of @xmath38 and @xmath37 .",
    "we will show that , projected to the subspace @xmath40 , the bosonic problem described above exactly maps onto a problem of non - interacting fermions with @xmath5 internal levels .",
    "we will first show that any wave function in @xmath40 is the product of a @xmath2 laughlin state and a completely antisymmetric wave function in the lowest landau level .",
    "we will then see that this antisymmetric wave function describes an effective system of non - interacting fermions .",
    "let @xmath41 be a wave function in @xmath40 .",
    "in order to be an eigenstate of @xmath38 with eigenvalue zero , @xmath41 must lie within the subspace spanned by tensor products of single particle states in the lowest landau level @xcite . in the symmetric gauge",
    "these single particle states are labeled by the third component of the angular momentum @xmath42 and the spin @xmath43 , and have the following form : @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is a @xmath28spinor with components @xmath48 , for @xmath49 .",

    "@xmath68= \\prod_{i < j }   ( z_{i}-z_{j})$ ] is proportional , up to a normalization constant , to the @xmath69 laughlin wave function .",

    "these data show how the critical frequency of rotation decreases as the number of internal states is increased , so that the observation of the fractional states @xmath8 requires less faster rotating traps , as we approximate @xmath2 . for an arbitrary number of particles @xmath4 we can estimate what is the condition that the frequency of rotation must fulfill in order for the a state @xmath8 to be the ground state .",
    "the state @xmath8 has a total angular momentum @xmath191 ( decreasing as @xmath192 ) , and thus an angular momentum energy per particle @xmath193 . in order to be in the rapid rotation regime",

    "this implies an upper limit for the trap frequency of @xmath198 .",

    "finally , the most restrictive condition to observe the fractional quantum hall states and their anyons is the temperature . in order to freeze out the excitations we need @xmath202 . for a system of @xmath167 particles the observation of the states",

    "we will show that , in the limit of rapid rotation , the ground state of the system is the product of a @xmath2 laughlin state and a completely antisymmetric wave function .",
    "this antisymmetric wave function has the structure of a bcs state of fermions with p - wave pairing .    from the results of section ii it follows that in the rapid rotation limit the ground state , @xmath41 , of the system must be both an analytic function of the @xmath56 s and an eigenstate of the interaction ( [ upup ] ) with eigenvalue @xmath209 .",
    "let s choose any pair of particles @xmath24 and @xmath55 .",
    "for @xmath41 to be annihilated by the interaction ( [ upup ] ) we have two possibilities .",
    "either the particles @xmath24 and @xmath55 are in a different spin state , or the relative angular momentum of the pair is larger than @xmath209 .",
    "it follows that either the spin triplet @xmath210 or the factor @xmath211 is a factor of @xmath41 .",
    "how many factors of the form @xmath211 and how many spin triplets we will have in the ground state will be the choice that costs the minimal amount of angular momentum energy , thus , we will have as many triplet states as possible .",
    "note that the maximum number of pairs that we can arrange in triplets is precisely @xmath100 , corresponding to a certain pairing of the particles .",
    "it follows that the ground state has the form @xmath212 where the pfaffian @xmath213 is defined by @xmath214 where @xmath215 are the elements of an antisymmetric matrix and @xmath103 denotes the operation of antisymmetrization , normalized such that each distinct term appears one with coefficient 1 .",
    "the state ( [ pfaff ] ) is the product of a @xmath2 laughlin state , in which the factor @xmath211 appears for all pairs of particles @xmath207 , and a pfaffian factor .",
    "the pfaffian factor acts in the following way .",
    "it chooses a pairing of the particles , and for all pairs @xmath207 within the pairing it removes the factor @xmath211 and substitutes it by a triplet state ( @xmath216 ) . in this way the system minimizes its total angular momentum , remaining in the subspace of zero interaction eigenstates .",
    "since the pfaffian factor is completely antisymmetric we can interpret it as the wave function of a system of @xmath4 effective fermions , in the same way that we did in section ii . in this case , however , the fermionic wave function is not an analytic function of the @xmath56 s , and , therefore it does not lie within the lowest landau level .",
    "such a pfaffian state has been shown to be the ground state solution of a bcs theory for fermions with p - wave triplet pairing @xcite . with this result",
    "we can say that the state ( [ pfaff ] ) is a superconducting state of effective fermions . it would very interesting to derive an effective hamiltonian for the fermionic wave function , in a similar way as we did in section ii .",
    "this effective hamiltonian should describe in this case fermions with attractive interactions between particles with different spin states .",
    "derivation of this hamiltonian will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown how by rapidly rotating a gas of ultra cold bosonic atoms , we can drive the system into a strong interacting regime in which novel correlated ground states and excitations appear .",
    "we have developed a theory that exactly maps the problem of interacting bosons in the rapid rotation regime to a problem of non  interacting fermions .",
    "this fermionization scheme allows us to find the exact ground state and low - lying excitations of the system . for the case of a system with no internal levels",
    "we recover the results of our previous work , with a @xmath3laughlin liquid as the ground state , and @xmath93 anyonic excitations . in the presence of @xmath5 internal levels and when the ratio @xmath6 is an integer number ,",
    "the ground state of the effective fermions is a @xmath7 integer quantum hall state .",
    "the corresponding bosonic ground state is a fractional multicomponent quantum hall liquid with filling factor @xmath8 .",
    "this fractional liquid is a highly correlated state made out of @xmath5 copies of a @xmath121laughlin liquid , one for each internal state . starting from these liquids",
    "we have shown how to create @xmath14anyons , by focusing lasers at the desired positions , coupled to @xmath180 different spin states .",
    "the fractional statistics of these anyons may be directly tested in a ramsey - type interferometer similar to the one we proposed to detect @xmath93 anyons .",
    "the experimental observation of the fractional quantum hall liquids and the anyons described in this work requires small temperatures , small number of atoms , and very fast rotating traps .",
    "the conditions required are relaxed as the number of internal levels increases .",
    "a possible scenario for the observation of these entangled states is a two  dimensional rotating optical lattice . as already shown in the recent experiment with a one - dimensional optical lattice it is possible to reach a regime in which a small fixed number of atoms is confined in each well of the lattice .",
