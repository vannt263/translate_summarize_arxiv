    "halo is one of the most interesting exotic nuclear phenomena . in halo nuclei , the extremely weakly binding property results in many new features , e.g. , the coupling between bound states and the continuum due to pairing correlations and very extended spatial density distributions .",
    "therefore one must consider properly the asymptotic behavior of nuclear densities at large distance @xmath1 from the center and treat in a self consistent way the discrete bound states , the continuum and the coupling between them in order to give a proper theoretical description of the halo phenomenon .",
    "this can be achieved by solving the non - relativistic hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb )  @xcite or the relativistic hartree bogoliubov ( rhb )  @xcite equations in coordinate ( @xmath1 ) space which can fully take into account the mean - field effects of the coupling to the continuum .    for spherical nuclei , relativistic hartree - bogoliubov theories in coordinate space",

    "the rchb theory has been generalized to treat the odd particle system  @xcite and combined with the glauber model , the charge - changing cross sections for c , n , o and f isotopes on a carbon target have been reproduced well  @xcite .    since most open shell nuclei are deformed , the interplay between deformation and weak binding raises interesting questions , such as whether or not there exist halos in deformed nuclei and , if yes , what are their new features . in order to consider properly the asymptotic behavior of nuclear densities at large @xmath1 and to make the numerical procedure less complicated , the woods - saxon basis has been proposed in ref .",

    ", lots of efforts have been made to develop a deformed relativistic hartree theory  @xcite and a deformed relativistic hartree bogoliubov theory in continuum ( the defrhbc theory )  @xcite . in order to describe the exotic nuclear structure in unstable odd-@xmath3 or odd - odd nuclei ,",
    "the defrhbc theory has been extended to incorporate the blocking effect due to the odd nucleon(s )  @xcite . the deformed relativistic hartree - bogoliubov theory in continuum with the density - dependent meson - nucleon couplings",
    "is developed recently  @xcite .",
    "the halo phenomenon in deformed nuclei has been investigated with the defrhbc theory  @xcite . in some deformed neutron - rich and weakly bound nuclei , e.g. , @xmath4 mg , a decoupling of the halo orbitals from the deformation of the core has been predicted . in this contribution , the results of the defrhbc theory on the study of deformed halo nuclei will be presented .",

    "the pairing potential then reads , @xmath14 and we need only the local part of the pairing tensor @xmath15    for axially deformed nuclei with the spatial reflection symmetry , we expand the potentials @xmath16 and @xmath17 in eq .",

    "the density distribution of this weakly bound nucleus has a very long tail in the direction perpendicular to the symmetry axis which indicates the prolate nucleus @xmath0 mg has an oblate halo and there is a decoupling between the deformations of the core and the halo .    the single particle spectrum around the fermi level for the ground state of @xmath0 mg is shown in fig .  [ fig : mg42_pro_lev ]  @xcite .",

    "the neutron fermi level is within the @xmath38 shell and most of the single particle levels have negative parities . since the chemical potential @xmath39 is close to the continuum , orbitals above the threshold have noticeable occupations due to the pairing correlations .",
    "the single neutron levels of @xmath0 mg can be divided into two parts , the deeply bound levels ( @xmath40 mev ) corresponding to the `` core '' , and the remaining weakly bound levels close to the threshold ( @xmath41 mev ) and in the continuum corresponding to the `` halo '' .",

    "@xcite , the shape of the halo originates from the intrinsic structure of the weakly bound or continuum orbitals . by examining the neutron density distribution",
    ", we learned that for the ground state of @xmath0 mg , the halo is mainly formed by level 4 and level 5 .",
    "note that the angular distribution of @xmath42 with a projection of the orbital angular momentum on the symmetry axis @xmath43 is prolate and that of @xmath44 with @xmath45 is oblate . for level 4 ( @xmath46 )",
    ", @xmath47 could be 0 or 1 since the third component of the total spin is @xmath48 .",
    "however , it turns out that the @xmath49 component dominates which results in an oblate shape . for level 5 ,",
    "since the third component of the total spin is @xmath50 , @xmath47 can only be 1 , which corresponds to an oblate shape too .",
    "therefore in @xmath0 mg the shape of the halo is oblate and decouples from the prolate core .",
    "the decoupling between the deformations of the core and the halo may manifest itself by some new experimental observables , e.g. , the double - hump shape of longitudinal momentum distribution in single - particle removal reactions and new dipole modes , etc . in particular , a combination of the experimental method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and the theoretical approach developed in ref .",
    "@xcite would be useful in the study of longitudinal momentum distribution in single - particle removal reactions with deformed halo nuclei as projectiles .",
    "the shape decoupling effects may also has some influence on the sub - barrier capture process in heavy ion collisions  @xcite .    for odd particle system , the formation and the size of",

    "we present recent progresses of the development of a deformed relativistic hartree - bogoliubov theory in continuum ( defrhbc ) and the study of neutron halo in deformed nuclei . in very neutron - rich deformed nuclei",
    "@xmath4 mg , pronounced deformed neutron halos were predicted .",
    "the halo is formed by several orbitals close to the threshold .",
    "these orbitals have large components of low @xmath51-values and feel therefore only a small centrifugal barrier .",
    "although their cores are prolately deformed , the deformation of the halos is slightly oblate .",
    "this implies a decoupling between the shapes of the core and the halo .",
    "the mechanism is investigated by studying the details of the neutron densities for core and halo , the single particle levels in the canonical basis , and the decomposition of the halo orbitals .",
    "it was concluded that the existence and the deformation of a possible neutron halo depends essentially on the quantum numbers of the main components of the single particle orbits in the vicinity of the fermi surface .",
