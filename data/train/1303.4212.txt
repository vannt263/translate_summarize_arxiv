    "since the seminal papers by f. giannessi ( see @xcite ) , variational inequalities have been applied to obtain necessary and sufficient optimality conditions in vector optimization . in @xcite a new approach to study set - valued problems has been applied to have a _",
    "fresh look _ to vector optimization .",
    "indeed , it turns out that vector optimization can be treated as a special case of set - valued optimization .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide some variational characterization of ( convex ) set - valued optimization . following the approach known as set - optimization we mean to introduce set - valued variational inequalities , both of stampachia and minty type , by means of dini - type derivatives ( see e.g. @xcite ) . under suitable assumptions ( e.g. lower semicontinuity type assumptions )",
    ", we can prove equivalence between solutions of the variational inequalities and solution of a ( primitive ) set - optimization problem , as introduced in @xcite and deepened in @xcite . to prove the main results we need also to deal with scalarization problems .",
    "however , while in the vector case this might only be a technical need , we prove that eventually the set - valued variational inequalities and their scalar counterparts provides different insight on the problem . some relevant information on the solution of the set - optimization problem are provided only through the scalar version of the inequality . the special case of vector optimization",
    "is finally studied , to recover classical results stated in @xcite .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to preliminar results on set - optimization that will be used throughout the paper .",
    "the concept of solution to a set - optimization problem and the dini - type derivatives are presented and some properties are proved .",
    "section 3 presents the main results . as the notion of solution relays on two properties ,",
    "we develop two different webs of relations between our variational inequalities and the set - optimization .",
    "the first one provides a variational characterization of the notion of infimizer , while the second one is devoted to characterize the notion of minimality .",
    "finally , section 4 applies the previous results to vector optimization .",
    "the notion of epigraphical extension of a single valued function is introduced to obtain a set - optimization problem equivalent to a vector one .",
    "the relations proved for the convex case in this paper reproduce those already known for the vector case between optimization and variational inequalities .",
