    "finding the center of mass is a fundamental part of the mechanics of rigid bodies .",
    "the center of mass of highly symmetric rigid bodies is easily obtained . however , if the shape and size of a body is affected by external factors , like gravity , its center of mass changes in a way that it is sometimes difficult to predict .",
    "this is the case with a soft helical spring .",
    "when such a spring is hung vertically it stretches non - uniformly , and its center of mass is no longer located at the center of the spring s length .    in this article , we find the center of mass of a vertically suspended soft spring ( a slinky ) using the calculus . here",
    ", we use the term `` soft '' to describe a spring whose stiffness is small enough so that its own weight stretches it noticeably when it is suspended vertically .",
    "our results are in excellent agreement with experimental results and non - analytic approaches . the method we use",
    "is easily incorporated into any undergraduate calculus or general physics course .",
    "consider a cylindrical helical spring of total mass @xmath0 , relaxed length @xmath1 ( neither stretched nor compressed ) , and stiffness constant @xmath2 .",
    "if the spring is suspended vertically , the mass per unit length becomes a function of position , and the spring stretches _ non - uniformly _ to a new length @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the elongation due to the spring s own weight .",
    "the static and dynamic properties of such a spring have been extensively discussed by several authors , and expressions for the vertical position of the @xmath5th turn and the stretch per unit mass have been derived  @xcite .",
    "our goal is to describe the spring elongation due to gravity in terms of position coordinates _ only_. a convenient set of equations are those given for the 3d helix in cartesian coordinates @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the radius of the spring , @xmath8 is the pitch ( the width of one complete turn ) , @xmath9 is the number of turns of the spring , @xmath10 is an angular parameter ( @xmath11 ) , and @xmath12 is the spring s elongation due to its own weight .    1.0 cm    to find @xmath12 , we consider first , for simplicity , the elongation of a horizontal spring pulled by a force @xmath13 as shown in figure  [ fig : hvsprings](a ) .",
    "when the spring is not stretched , we use @xmath14 as the position variable to locate any particular turn .",
    "this variable runs from one end of the spring up to its total _ natural length _",
    "( @xmath15 ) .",
    "likewise , when the spring is stretched and gives rise to an elongation @xmath16 , we use the variable @xmath17 running from one end of the spring up to its maximum length of elongation ( @xmath18 ) . from the geometry of the problem , @xmath19 let us consider a spring portion of length @xmath20 located at a distance @xmath17 from an end fixed to a wall . for a uniform spring , the elongation of this segment is given by the direct proportion @xmath21 with @xmath22 being the _ dimensionless _ horizontal elongation factor of the segment .",
    "mak  @xcite showed that if @xmath23 is the stiffness constant of this segment , then from hooke s law and equation  , we have @xmath24 with @xmath25 representing the stiffness constant of the whole spring .",
    "( when a spring is divided into segments , each segment has a stiffness constant different and bigger than the stiffness constant of the whole spring . )    on the other hand , if the spring is suspended vertically ( see figure  [ fig : hvsprings](b ) ) , then , accordingly to galloni and kohen  @xcite , each segment @xmath20 of the spring experiences an elongation proportional to the weight of the spring below the segment , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the acceleration due to gravity .",
    "following hooke s law , we get @xmath28 with @xmath29 the vertical elongation factor of the segment . using   and",
    ", @xmath23 and @xmath20 can be eliminated from  , and the elongation factor takes the form @xmath30 this allows us to find the contribution @xmath12 to the vertical elongation of the spring by integrating the elongation factor @xmath31 from the top of the spring @xmath32 to any particular turn @xmath33 , obtaining @xmath34",
    "to find the position of the center of mass of the suspended spring , we first calculate its linear mass density @xmath35 .",
    "if we assume that the mass of the spring is uniformly distributed along the entire helix , then the density takes the form @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the total arc length of the spring . since the contribution @xmath12 to the vertical elongation of the spring does not affect the length @xmath37 , the infinitesimal element of arc can be written as @xmath38 , and the total arc length of the spring calculated as follows @xmath39 ^ 2 + \\left[\\dfrac{dy}{d\\theta}\\right]^2 + \\left[\\dfrac{d(c\\,\\theta)}{d\\theta}\\right]^2}\\,d\\theta    = \\int_0^{2 \\pi n } \\sqrt{r^2 + c^2}\\,d\\theta    = 2 \\pi n \\sqrt{r^2 + c^2}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the lower and upper bounds of the integral represent the starting and ending turns of the spring .",
    "now , the position of the center of mass can be determined from the equations @xmath40 if the spring is made of an integral number of turns ( i.e. , complete loops ) , symmetry implies that @xmath41 .",
    "however , we must calculate the last integral in equation   to find the vertical position of the center of mass .",
    "this can be done easily if the element of mass @xmath42 is written as @xmath43 therefore @xmath44\\,d\\theta   = \\dfrac{l_0}{2 } + \\dfrac{m_{\\mathrm{s}}\\,g}{3\\,k}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    galloni  @xcite and mak  @xcite , in separate studies of the static and dynamic effects of the mass of a soft spring , found that the total elongation due to gravity of a vertically suspended spring is given by @xmath45 .",
    "using this result , equation   becomes @xmath46 in other words , the center of mass of the suspended spring is displaced from its position when not suspended by two - thirds of its elongation due to gravity ( see figure  [ fig : helixes ] )",

    "this particular problem is an excellent pedagogic tool for beginning students in mathematics and physics . in particular",
    ", it shows the usefulness of a variety of calculus concepts applied to a physical problem to which all students can relate .",
    "it is instructive to compare our results with some other models .",
    "for example , the results of our calculations are in agreement with experimental observations by toepker  @xcite .",
    "equation   is also in accord with equations obtained by newburgh and andes  @xcite , and ruby  @xcite , who used a hybrid calculus / non - calculus approach .",
    "equation   also agrees with the center of mass equation of a suspended slinky obtained by hosken  @xcite , in his revision of french s work  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that there is a difference from their center of mass equation to ours by a factor of @xmath47 .",
    "this is easily explained by the fact that these authors did not incorporate the @xmath47 correction to the total spring mass explained in the works of galloni  @xcite and mak  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", our approach does not concur with the model proposed by sawicki  @xcite .",
    "he found that the center of mass should be located at a distance @xmath48 measured from the point of suspension ."
