    "observations by the _ egret _ instrument ( 30 mev  30 gev ; thompson et al . 1993 ) onboard the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ ( _ cgro _ )",
    "reveal that @xmath0ray emission dominates the apparent power output for many blazar type active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "about 50 sources detected with _",
    "egret _ in the high - energy @xmath0ray band are identified with blazars ( see , e.g. , mattox et al .",
    "1997b ; mukherjee et al .",
    "the @xmath0ray emission extends up to tev energies for three nearby blazars : mrk 421 ( @xmath7 = 0.031 ; punch et al .",
    "1992 ; petry et al .",
    "1996 ) , mrk 501 ( @xmath7 = 0.034 ; quinn et al . 1996",
    "; bradbury et al . 1997 ; aharonian et al . 1997 ) and 1es 2344 + 514 ( @xmath7 = 0.044 ; weekes et al . 1996 ; catanese et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the overall electromagnetic spectra of blazars , when plotted in the @xmath8@xmath9 space , generally reveal two broad peaks ; one located between ir and x  rays , and another in the @xmath0ray regime ( e.g. , von montigny et al .",
    "1995 ) ; in a few objects , additional components are observed in the ir / optical band , but those are probably not directly associated with the blazar phenomenon , but instead they are likely to be due to the isotropic emission of the associated agn ( e.g. , falomo et al .",
    "the models invoked to explain the radiative processes in blazars have these two components correspond to two different emission processes from the same population of relativistic particles .",
    "the polarization observed in the radio and optical bands indicates that the lower energy emission is most likely due to the synchrotron process , while the inverse - compton mechanism is thought to be dominant for the high energy @xmath0ray emission ( see , e.g. , ulrich , maraschi & urry 1997 ) .",
    "however , the source of the ` seed ' photons for the compton process is a matter of debate . in some models , it is synchrotron radiation internal to the jet  the synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) model ( jones et al .",
    "1974 ; marscher 1980 ; knigl 1981 ; marscher & gear 1985 ; ghisellini & maraschi 1989 ; maraschi et al . 1992",
    "; marscher & travis 1996 ) , while in others , it is radiation external to the jet  the external radiation compton ( erc ) model ( dermer & schlickeiser 1993 ; sikora , begelman , & rees 1994 ) .",
    "blazars are highly variable from radio to @xmath0ray bands : flares with time scales as short as 15 minutes have been observed in the tev range ( gaidos et al .",
    "the correlation of variability between different bands can potentially discriminate between various models .",
    "the first tev blazar that was observed simultaneously in multiple bands from radio to tev @xmath0rays is mrk 421 .",
    "the first campaign , conducted in 1994 ( macomb et al .",
    "1995 ) , revealed correlated variability between the kev x  ray and tev @xmath0ray emission , where the @xmath0ray flux varied by an order of magnitude on a time scale of 2 days and the x  ray flux was observed to double in 12 hours . on the other hand , the high - energy @xmath0ray flux observed by _",
    "egret _ , as well as the radio and uv fluxes showed less variability than the kev or tev bands . another mrk 421 multiwavelength campaign performed in 1995 revealed another coincident kev / tev flare ( buckley et al .",
    "1996 ; takahashi et al . 1996b ) . although the relative amplitudes of variability are different , the uv and optical bands also showed correlation during the flares .",
    "these results indicate that the high energy tail of the energy distribution of a single electron population is responsible for both the x ",
    "rays and tev @xmath0rays ( takahashi et al .",
    "1996a ) . with the detection of tev emission from mrk 501 ( quinn et al . 1996 ) ,",
    "several multi - band campaigns were organized to observe this object to verify if such a behavior is a general property of tev - emitting blazars , or if it is unique to mrk 421 .    during the april 1997 multiwavelength campaign for mrk 501 , both x  rays and tev @xmath0rays increased by more than one order of magnitude from quiescent level ( catanese et al .",
    "1997 ; pian et al .",
    "while the synchrotron emission peaked below 0.1 kev in the quiescent state , in 1997 it peaked at @xmath4 100 kev  the largest shift ever observed for a blazar ( pian et al .",
    "1998 ) ; this is in contrast to mrk 421 , which shows relatively little variability of the position of the synchrotron peak ( e.g. , macomb et al .",
    "mastichiadis & kirk ( 1997 ) suggest that the ssc scheme in a homogeneous region is sufficient to interpret the multiband spectrum of mrk 421 .",
    "they also suggest that the flare in 1994 is probably caused by a change in the maximum energy of electrons ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the origin of the april 1997 flare of mrk 501 was also investigated by pian et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "they calculated that the variation of the @xmath3 together with an increased luminosity and a flattening of the injected electron distribution can describe observed spectra well .",
    "their model shows good agreement with the data , but does not reproduce the tev @xmath0-ray flux during the high state in april 1997 .",
    "the correlation between the high - energy @xmath0ray and other bands is important to study the radiation mechanisms of blazars . a combined gev and tev spectrum can place a strong limit on the high energy emission and its relation with the low energy emission .",
    "however , observations of hbls ( high - frequency - peaked bl lac objects ) in the high - energy @xmath0-ray band from 30 mev to several gev are difficult because hbls are faint in this energy band ( e.g. , mukherjee et al . 1997 ) . for instance , mrk 421 is detected at a level comparable to the _ egret _ sensitivity ( fichtel et al . 1994 ; thompson et al . 1995 ) .",

    "in this paper we present mrk 501 data from simultaneous march 1996 observations by _ asca _ ( kev ) , _ egret _ ( gev ) and _ whipple _ ( tev ) , together with the optical observations .",
    "the _ egret _",
    "observation during this campaign indicates a detection with 3.5 @xmath1 significance ( e @xmath2 100 mev ) during a 3.2 day interval of peak flux . also , a month later , _ egret",
    "_ detected mrk 501 with 4.0 @xmath1 significance ( e @xmath2 100 mev ; 5.2 @xmath1 for e @xmath2 500 mev ) .",

    "the observations and analysis are presented in @xmath102 .",
    "the multifrequency spectra during the campaign are described and compared with the april 1997 flare state and a quiescent state in @xmath103 .",
    "we discuss the radiation mechanism of tev blazar mrk 501 in @xmath104 , and present our conclusions in @xmath105 .",
    "we observed mrk 501 four times with _ asca _ during 1996 march 21.3 @xmath11 april 2.9 ut .",
    "each pointing was about 10 ksec in duration .",
    "the observations were performed in a nominal , 1ccd mode for the solid - state imaging spectrometer ( sis : burke et al .",
    "1991 ) , and a nominal ph mode for the gas imaging spectrometer ( gis : ohashi et al .",
    "we applied standard screening procedures to the data and extracted the counts from a circular region centered on the target with a radius of 3 and 6 arcmin for sis and gis , respectively .",
    "we used standard blank sky observations to estimate the background . the sis light curves of these 4 observations are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the count rate includes the background of @xmath4 0.01 counts s@xmath12 .",
    "the flux change between the observations 2 and 3 indicates variability on a time scale of about a day .",
    "the flux calculated from the spectrum decreased by a factor 2 over two weeks .",
    "no evidence was found for time variability within each of the four observations ; the maximum @xmath13 probability of variability was less than 97 @xmath14 .",
    "we summed all photons detected with both siss into a single spectrum for each observation , because the hardness ratio ( defined as the ratio of counting rates at 1.5  7.5 kev to those at 0.7  1.5 kev ) did not change significantly .",
    "here we do not use the gis data , since the efficiency of giss in the low energy band ( e @xmath15 2 kev ) is worse than that for sis , and thus of less utility in a study of details of the spectral shape at low energies ; furthermore , for this bright source , and a relatively simple model , with siss alone , we probably reached the level where the statistical errors are comparable to the systematic errors .",
    "we first fitted such combined sis spectra ( one per observation ) with a single power law with photoelectric absorption whose column density @xmath16 was fixed at galactic value , 1.73 @xmath5 10@xmath17 @xmath18 ( elvis et al . 1989 ) .",
    "however , this model did not represent any of the 4 spectra adequately ; a power law fitting the data above 2 kev was too steep for the data below 2 kev .",
    "all the sis data for these 4 observations showed such discrepancy that the reduced @xmath19 ranged from 1.6 to 2.0 for more than 300 d.o.f .",
    "the single power law model is thus rejected with higher than 99 % confidence level .",
    "a better fit was obtained using a broken power law model with galactic absorption , where the spectrum is harder below the break .",
    "even with this more complex model , we observe a clear spectral variability from one observation to another .",
    "as summarized in table 1 , the spectrum steepened as the flux decreased from ( 9.24 @xmath20 0.05 ) to ( 4.21 @xmath20 0.03)@xmath510@xmath21 erg @xmath18 sec@xmath12 in 2  10 kev . the photon index ( @xmath22 ) below the break energy ( @xmath23 ) changed from 1.72 @xmath20 0.08 to 1.89 @xmath20 0.08 while the index ( @xmath24 ) above @xmath23 changed from 2.15 @xmath20 0.02 to 2.46 @xmath20 0.03 .",
    "but the difference @xmath25 was roughly constant , @xmath4 0.5 , for all periods .",
    "although we do not use gis data for the above fits , the parameters derived here are consistent when we used both gis2 and gis3 data .",
    "figure 2 shows the correlation between the x  ray flux and the photon index .",
    "the maximum flux observed with _",
    "asca _ was five times higher than the quiescent level observed with _",
    "( makino et al . 1991 ) , and one fifth of the highest flux ever observed ( pian et al . 1998 ) .",
    "as shown in figure 2 , the x  ray spectrum tends to steepen as the source gets fainter .",
    "this is a general feature of hbl spectra ( see , e.g. , giommi et al .",
    "the spectral break around 2 kev was observed with both _",
    "asca _ and _ bepposax _ ( pian et al .",
    "1998 ) , while no spectral break was seen in the simultaneous _ rosat _ pspc and _ ginga _ observation , when the combined 0.1  20 kev spectrum was well - described by a power law with the photon index of 2.63 ( makino et al . 1991 ) .",
    "we report here new _ egret _",
    "results for mrk 501 , for which no _ egret _ detection has been reported previously .",
    "we have performed likelihood analysis ( mattox et al . 1996 ) of all viewing periods ( vp ) with exposure greater than 8 @xmath5 @xmath26 @xmath27 s for @xmath0-ray energies e @xmath2 100 mev ; the results are shown in table 2 .",
    "contributions from diffuse high - latitude galactic emission and extragalactic emission ( sreekumar et al .",
    "1998 ) were incorporated in the analysis .",
    "note that for vp 519.0 the result is a 4.0 @xmath1 detection , barely meeting the acceptance criterion used in the construction of _ egret _ catalogs ( thompson et al .",
    "1995 ) .    at this point ,",
    "considerable caution is required , because of the large size ( @xmath4 5 degrees ) of the _ egret _ point spread function ( psf ) , and in this instance because of possible source confusion . within 5 degrees of mrk 501",
    "are three flat spectrum radio quasars : ( 1 ) 3c 345 and ( 2 ) nrao 512 , neither of which have ever been convincingly detected by _",
    "egret _ but which are otherwise similar to the highly variable _ egret _",
    "-detected quasars ; and ( 3 ) 4c + 38.41 , which has been detected several times by _ egret _ , and at times has been very bright . to verify that the source detected in vp 519.0 really was mrk 501 ,",
    "an analysis was done for e @xmath2 500 mev .",
    "although the number of photons detected above 500 mev is considerably smaller than above 100 mev , the extent of the psf for the higher - energy photons is reduced by a factor of about 6 in solid angle , enough to remove the possibility of confusion with the other nearby objects .",
    "the result of the e @xmath2 500 mev analysis is a 5.2 @xmath1 detection , and source location contours ( figure 3 ) that clearly pinpoint mrk 501 as the source of the @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "the strong e @xmath2 500 mev detection suggests a very hard spectrum , and indeed , spectral analysis gives a photon spectral index of 1.3 @xmath20 0.5 , one of the hardest spectra ever determined with _",
    "egret _ .",
    "the vp 516.5 & 519.0 observations listed in table 2 have been examined for a possible time variability .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test of the cumulative number of events ( with e @xmath2 70 mev ) from the direction of mrk 501 as a function of time has been performed ( as described by mattox et al .",
    "for the 21 march  3 april 1996 _ egret _ observation ( which coincides with the _ asca _ observation described in @xmath102.1 ) , kuiper s variant of the ks test ( press et al . 1992 ) indicates variability with 98.9 % confidence .",
    "this interval was therefore analyzed through a likelihood analysis of four equal length intervals with e @xmath2 100 mev .",
    "the light curve thus produced is shown in figure 1 . the second sub - interval ,",
    "24.96  28.17 march 1996 , showed a detection significance of 3.5 @xmath1 , and a flux of ( 32 @xmath20 13 ) @xmath28 @xmath18s@xmath12 , e @xmath2 100 mev .",
    "the spectral photon index was measured to be 1.6 @xmath20 0.5 in the 30 mev  10 gev energy range during the 24.96  28.17 march 1996 sub - interval .",
    "a @xmath19 test of variability using the fluxes of these four intervals indicates variability with 88 % confidence . from figure 1 ,",

    "poor weather prohibited strictly simultaneous observations for most of the campaign .",
    "it was possible , nevertheless , to obtain a few measurements on march 26 and 27 , 1996 .",
    "three observations in r - band were taken in both nights , separated by about one hour . since no variability was found within either of the nights within the photometric accuracy of @xmath4 1.8 % , the three frames were co - added and an average flux for each of the nights was derived .",

    "the convolution in equation ( 2 ) is performed under the condition @xmath71 from the kinematics of electron - photon scattering .",
    "we applied this model to the observed spectrum of mrk 501 . to approximate the values for magnetic field and beaming factor , we first place constraints on the allowed parameter space similar to bednarek & protheroe ( 1997 ) , calculated for the case of mrk 421 . in the following prescriptions",
    ", we basically assume the parameter space for the march 1996 data . however , because of the lack of the information in the hard x - ray band and the high energy tail of the tev spectrum during this campaign , we also use the non - contemporaneous data sets for the calculation .",
    "since the _ ginga _ data in the quiescent state shows no spectral cut off below 20 kev ( figure 4 ) , it is probable that the synchrotron spectrum in march 1996 also extends above 20 kev .",

    "thus the energy density of the synchrotron radiation @xmath80 is related to the magnetic field density @xmath81 as @xmath81 = @xmath80 ( @xmath82/@xmath83 ) , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 is the observed synchrotron / compton luminosity .",

    "one can also see the discrepancy in the radio band , but this can be an effect of at least a part of the emission arising at a larger distance than the location of the kev / tev emitting region .",
    "the one - zone models can not account for the low - energy emission , which is thought to be produced in a much larger region of the source ( e.g. , marscher et al .",
    "1980 ; see also pian et al .",
    "however , investigation of this low - energy discrepancy is beyond the scope of this paper ; in the following , we concentrate on the discrepancy in the higher energy band where the one - zone models are thought to be a reasonable approximation to account for the power output of blazars .",

    "the photon index in the _ egret _ energy range ( 30 mev ",

    "it is worthwhile to compare the overall spectrum , and the parameters derived by us to those obtained for mrk 421 ( see , e.g. , takahashi et al .",
    "observationally , the spectrum of mrk 421 also shows a spectral break around 1 kev , but its energy does _ not _ seem to vary more than a factor of a few when the source enters a flare state , while mrk 501 shows a change of a factor of @xmath129 .",
    "our modelling indicates that the derived magnetic field @xmath77 is comparable between the two sources , on the order of 0.2 gauss , but the main difference appears to be the energy of electrons radiating at the peak of the synchrotron component during the flare , @xmath3 , which for mrk 421 is a few @xmath5 @xmath130 to @xmath91 , while for the flare of mrk 501 , it is larger , several @xmath5 @xmath91 or greater ( e.g. , inoue & takahara 1996 ; pian et al .",
    "1998 ; see also below ) . while for mrk 421 , an independent verification of these parameters exists via the comparison of the klein - nishina limit to the implications of the spectral variability observed in x",
    " rays ( e.g. , mastichiadis & kirk 1997 ; bednarek & protheroe 1997 ) , we do not have a well - sampled x  ray light curve for mrk 501 , and",
    "thus can not make such a comparison here .    in any case , those large differences indicate that the overall electromagnetic spectra of hbls are qualitatively similar , but peaking at different energies , which is likely to be a result of different energy distribution of radiating electrons .",
    "kubo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found that @xmath77 is similar over a large range of blazar classes , and the difference of the overall spectra  where the blazars associated with quasars ( showing emission lines ) have synchrotron components peaking in the infrared , as opposed to hbls , where these peaks are in the x  ray regime  can be also explained by lower @xmath3 in quasar - type blazars than in hbls .",
    "however , it is not possible as yet to determine if this is intrinsic , i.e. related to different conditions for the particle acceleration process , or if some external conditions ( such as the strong diffuse radiation field ) play an important role in the particle population inferred from the observations .",
    "we next investigate whether the one - zone ssc model might be helpful to understand the large flare observed in april 1997 .",
    "inspection of figure 4 suggests that two different components probably contribute to the synchrotron spectrum , one a steady component , and another , variable , responsible for the sudden increase of the highly energetic electrons , when the source goes into the flare state .",
    "we set @xmath3 to 5.5 @xmath5 @xmath121 for the april 7 data and 7.0 @xmath5 @xmath121 for the april 16 data .",
    "the parameters such as region size , magnetic field , and beaming factor are the same as that for march 1996 .",
    "the normalization was determined from the synchrotron spectra obtained during the _ bepposax _ observations ( pian et al .",
    "1998 ) . for these flare data ,",
    "a single break population of electrons is adequate to account for the multiband spectrum ( @xmath50 @xmath4 @xmath51 ) .",
    "we first assumed that the newly injected electrons scatter only the photons emitted by the electron population associated with the flare .",
    "however , the calculated flare amplitude of the tev flux was substantially lower than that observed .",
    "we next assumed that there exists a steady population of synchrotron photons , with the same level as that in 1996 , and those are scattered by the flare electron population . in this case , the flare amplitude of the tev flux is quite well reproduced as shown in figure 4 .",
    "the photon index in the _ hegra _ region is predicted to be 2.6 for april 7 1997 , comparable with the observational data of 2.49 @xmath20 0.11 @xmath20 0.25 ( aharonian et al . 1997 ) .",
    "this result is consistent with pian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , where the scattering of the steady component by the flare electron population is necessary to account for the flare amplitude of the tev flux .",
    "this may imply that the steady and the flare components arise from close parts of the jet , having some interaction with each other .",
    "unfortunately , the observed data during the flare are too sparse to discriminate whether the two emission components originate in the same region or different regions of the jet . more precise observations in various energy bands ( and , in particular , better sampling ) are necessary to further understand this problem .    the relatively flat shape of the spectrum observed with _",
    "hegra _ in march 1996 is discrepant with our one - zone model .",
    "we investigated two possible causes of this discrepancy .",
    "the first is the external soft photons from the host galaxy or obscuring torus and the other is the multiple comptonization .",
    "the integration of the stellar light from the galaxy can be the origin of the ir / optical feature present around 10@xmath122 hz ( see figure 4 ; falomo et al .",
    "these photons are distributed isotropically in the observer s frame and are injected externally into the emission region .",
    "the ir photons are important since they can be scattered to tev energies ( @xmath3 @xmath4 10@xmath131 ) without entering the klein - nishina regime .",
    "additionally , comptonization of such external photons can be more effective than ssc , because of the anisotropy of injected photons in the frame of the jet ( sikora et al .",
    "1994 ; dermer 1995 ; dermer et al .",
    "1997 ) . to account for the flat tev spectrum with such external radiation",
    ", the observed external compton luminosity ( @xmath132 ) must be at least comparable with the synchrotron luminosity ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "this means that the energy densities of magnetic field and external photons have the relation @xmath133",
    "@xmath4 @xmath134/@xmath135 @xmath33 @xmath81/@xmath136 , where @xmath133 is the density of external photons in the observer s frame and @xmath134 in the jet frame . for our model of @xmath77 = 0.2 gauss and @xmath76 = 15",
    ", we obtain the constraint of @xmath133 @xmath33 10@xmath137 erg @xmath126 .",
    "the typical values for the total luminosity of the galaxy @xmath138 = 10@xmath139 erg s@xmath12 and effective radius @xmath140 = 1 kpc ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) give the energy density of @xmath133 @xmath4 3 @xmath5 10@xmath21 erg @xmath126  much smaller than the lower limit given above and thus the galactic ir photons are nt expected to affect the tev spectrum .",
    "however , if the ir photons arise in a region comparable to a parsec - scale torus , postulated to exist in seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , antonucci & miller 1985 ; krolik & begelman 1986 )  then , such a photon field may be important ( e.g. , sikora et al . 1994 ) .",
    "these photons can be emitted from the dust around the nucleus , but may be hidden by the strong jet emission in the observer s frame ; in fact , our spectrum ( see figure 4 ) does not exclude such emission .",
    "we can easily predict that if the total luminosity of such ir photons exceeds @xmath141",
    "@xmath33 10@xmath142 erg s@xmath12 , it can contribute sufficient seed photons that subsequently would be comptonized to dominate the tev spectrum .",
    "the precise ( sub - arcsec ) ir / optical imaging of mrk 501 should limit the spatial extent of the ` ir  bump ' mentioned above .",
    "the second possible cause of the tev spectral discrepancy is the contribution of photons produced by multiple compton scattering ( e.g. , band et al .",
    "1985 , 1986 ; bloom & marscher 1996 ) . in considering the second - order scattering , the same formula ( 2 ) is used , except that the incident photons are now the first - order inverse compton photon density ( bloom & marscher 1996 ) .",
    "our calculation shows the contribution from multiple compton scattering is greatly suppressed due to the klein - nishina effect .",
    "the flux ratio for comptonization of first and second order is @xmath143/@xmath144 @xmath145 10@xmath146 at 1 tev .",
    "thus , the second order ssc process does not make a significant contribution to the spectrum , and we are unable to explain the relatively flat tev spectrum in march 1996 .",
    "a beaming factor much larger than 10 could also make tev spectrum flatter .",
    "however , our previous calculation shows that at @xmath76 @xmath33 40 , compton cooling time for highly energetic electrons becomes larger than the source crossing time scale @xmath95 and thus no clear break should appear in the electron population .",
    "also , a beaming factor much larger than 10 ( e.g. , @xmath76 @xmath33 100 ) does nt reproduce the gev / tev flux ratio of @xmath147/@xmath148 @xmath4 10 , but makes both fluxes comparable because most of the scattering will take place in the thomson regime .",
    "although the boundary for the allowed parameter space could be changed if variability on shorter time scales is found ( see figure 5 ) , a more tightly constrained tev spectral index ( through better statistics and less systematic error ) will be of great value to make further progress on modelling of this source .",
    "together with more refined ssc models such as marscher ( 1980 ) and ghisellini & maraschi ( 1989 ) , we have shown that an exact evaluation of comptonized emission from external ir photons , such as dust emission around the nuclei and accretion disk photons , may be useful for the understanding of the origin of the flat tev spectrum .",
    "our model here is constructed with no time dependence . to be exact ,",
    "this model should be expanded to include the full time dependent evolution of the electron and photon spectra ( e.g. , mastichiadis & kirk 1997 ) .",
    "the time dependent treatment for mrk 501 flare will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "we have conducted a multiwavelength campaign for the tev blazar mrk 501 in march 1996 . in the _ egret _ data , we found 3.5 @xmath1 detection ( e @xmath2 100 mev ) of high - energy @xmath0-rays .",
    "higher flux was also observed in april / may 1996 , with 4.0 @xmath1 significance for e @xmath2 100 mev , and 5.2 @xmath1 significance for e @xmath2 500 mev .",

    ", there were notable changes in overall spectra , such as a 2 decade shift of the peak frequency of the synchrotron component , a change of peak flux in the kev region by a factor of 9 , and a flux change in the tev region by a factor of 33 . to investigate a correlated variation of spectra in the kev and tev region",
    ", we applied a one - zone , homogeneous ssc model with an electron distribution having two break points .",
    "the allowed parameter space ( @xmath77 , @xmath76 ) was systematically investigated to obtain values for the model parameters .",

    "the correlation of the kev / tev flare amplitudes in april 1997 was also reproduced with the assumption that an additional electron population , with higher maximum energies ( @xmath3 @xmath4 6 @xmath5 10@xmath131 ) was newly injected and scattered the photons emitted from the steady component , assumed to be the same level as that in 1996 .",

    "<S> we present the results of a multiwavelength campaign for mrk 501 performed in march 1996 with _ asca _ , _ egret _ , _ whipple _ , and optical telescopes . </S>",

    "<S> asca _ was 5 times higher than the quiescent level and gradually decreased by a factor of 2 during the observation in march 1996 . in the x  ray band , </S>",
    "<S> a spectral break was observed around 2 kev . </S>",
    "<S> we report here for the first time the detection of high - energy @xmath0ray flux from mrk 501 with _ egret _ with 3.5 @xmath1 significance ( e @xmath2 100 mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> higher flux was also observed in april / may 1996 , with 4.0 @xmath1 significance for e @xmath2 100 mev , and 5.2 @xmath1 significance for e @xmath2 500 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0ray spectrum was measured to be flatter than most of the @xmath0ray blazars . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the multiband spectrum in 1996 is consistent with that calculated from a one - zone ssc model where x  </S>",
    "<S> rays are produced via synchrotron emission , and @xmath0-rays via inverse compton scattering of synchrotron photons in a homogeneous region . </S>",
    "<S> the flux of tev @xmath0rays is consistent with the predictions of the model if the decrease of the compton - scattering cross section in the klein - nishina regime is considered . in the context of this model </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the values of the magnetic field strength and the beaming factor allowed by the observational results . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the march 1996 multiwavelength spectrum with that in the flare state in april 1997 . between these two epochs , </S>",
    "<S> the tev flux increase is well correlated with that observed in kev range . </S>",
    "<S> the kev and tev amplitudes during the april 1997 flare are accurately reproduced by a one - zone ssc model , assuming that the population of synchrotron photons in 1996 are scattered by the newly injected relativistic electrons , having maximum energies of @xmath3 @xmath4 6 @xmath5 10@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the tev spectrum observed during march 1996 campaign is flatter than predicted by our models . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this can not be explained by either higher order comptonization or the contribution of the ` seed ' ir photons from the host galaxy for the first - order external radiation comptonization , but we can not exclude possible effects of the ir photons that may arise in the parsec - size torus postulated to exist in agn . </S>"
