    "this note reports the averaged mass of the top quark ( @xmath0 ) obtained by combining the most precise tevatron measurements of its mass at the tevatron @xmath1 collider at fermilab , and updates the combination presented in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "reference  @xcite also provides a detailed description of the systematic uncertainties . the cdf and d0 tevatron experiments , and the atlas and cms lhc experiments , also provided a combination of their most precise top - quark mass measurements  @xcite .",
    "the cdf and d0 collaborations have performed several direct measurements of the top - quark mass .",
    "the pioneering measurements were first based on approximately @xmath5 of  data  @xcite collected from 1992 to 1996 , that included results from @xmath6  ( all  jets ) , @xmath7  ( @xmath8+jets or lepton+jets ) , and @xmath9  ( @xmath10 or dilepton ) channels , where @xmath8 refers to electrons or muons ( all charge - conjugate final states are considered in the analyses ) .",
    "decays of @xmath11 followed by leptonic @xmath12 or @xmath13 decays are included in the direct leptonic @xmath14 and @xmath15 decay channels .",
    "( 20012011 ) had a variety of @xmath0  measurements , and those considered in this paper are the most recent results in these channels , using up to @xmath16 of data for cdf ( corresponding to all the cdf run ii data )  @xcite , and using @xmath2 of data for d0 ( corresponding to all the d0 run ii data )  @xcite .",
    "the cdf analyses based on charged - particle tracking for exploiting the transverse decay length of @xmath17-tagged jets ( @xmath18 ) and the transverse momentum of electrons and muons from @xmath19 boson decays ( @xmath20 ) , using data corresponding to a luminosity of 1.9  @xmath21  @xcite , are not expected to be updated    the latter analysis is not included in the combination because of a statistical correlation with other samples .",
    "the tevatron average @xmath0  is obtained by combining five published  measurements  @xcite with six published   results  @xcite and with the preliminary d0 combination  @xcite of  dilepton measurements  @xcite . this combination supersedes the previous combinations of refs .  .",
    "compared to the summer 2014 tevatron combination of ref .",
    "@xcite :    * the  d0 measurements in the @xmath10 channels have been updated based on the entire  data , using a neutrino weighting technique  @xcite and a matrix element method  @xcite .",
    "the former measurement is published and the latter has been accepted for publication in phys .",
    "d. both measurements use the same data and are therefore correlated . their combination , discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is used as input to the present combination . * the  cdf measurements in the @xmath10  @xcite and all  jets channels  @xcite",
    "are now published , while they were preliminary in summer 2014 .",
    "the published @xmath10 measurement does not differ significantly from its preliminary version .",
    "the published all  jets measurement is identical to its preliminary version .    the definition and evaluation of the systematic uncertainties and of the correlations among channels , experiments , and tevatron runs is the outcome of many years of joint effort between the cdf and d0 collaborations that is described in ref .",
    "the measurements in the present combination are calibrated through the input values of @xmath0  in the monte carlo ( mc ) .",
    "it is expected that the difference between the mc mass definition and the pole mass of the top quark is @xmath22  2  @xcite .",
    "the input measurements and uncertainty categories used in the combination are discussed in sections  [ sec : inputs ] and  [ sec : uncertainty ] , respectively .",
    "the correlations assumed in the combination are discussed in section  [ sec : corltns ] , and the resulting tevatron average top - quark mass is given in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "a summary is presented in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the twelve measurements of @xmath0  used in this combination are shown in table  [ tab : inputs ] .",
    "the  measurements all have relatively large statistical uncertainties and their systematic uncertainties are dominated by the uncertainty in jet energy scale ( jes ) . in both cdf and d0",
    "take advantage of the larger @xmath23  samples , and employ new analysis techniques to reduce the uncertainties . in particular , the  d0 analysis in the @xmath8+jets channel and the  cdf analyses in the @xmath8+jets , all  jets , and met channels constrain the response of light - quark jets using the kinematic information from @xmath24 decays ( the so - called in situ calibration )  @xcite .",
    "residual jes uncertainties associated with @xmath25 and @xmath26 dependence , as well as uncertainties specific to the response of @xmath17 jets , are treated separately .",
    "the  d0 @xmath10 measurements use the jes determined in the @xmath8+jets channel through the in situ calibration  @xcite .",
    "the d0  @xmath8+jets result is the most accurate single result from the tevatron  @xcite . unlike the other inputs , the cdf all  jets measurement  @xcite uses a next - to - leading order generator as default program to model @xmath23  events ( powheg  @xcite ) .",
    "table  [ tab : inputs ] lists the individual uncertainties in each result , subdivided into the categories described in the next section .",
    "the correlations between the inputs are described in sec .",
    "[ sec : corltns ] .",
    "we employ uncertainty categories similar to those used for the previous tevatron combination  @xcite , with small modifications to better account for their correlations .",
    "they are divided into sources of same or similar origin that are combined as in ref .",
    "for example , the _ signal modeling _ ( _ signal _ ) category discussed below includes the uncertainties from different systematic sources that are correlated due to their origin in the modeling of the simulated signal .",
    "some systematic uncertainties have been separated into multiple categories to accommodate specific types of correlations .",
    "for example , the jet energy scale ( jes ) uncertainty is subdivided into six components to more accurately accommodate our best understanding of the relevant correlations among input measurements .    in this note",
    "we use the new naming scheme described in ref .",
    "the previous names of the systematic uncertainties are given in parentheses .    statistical uncertainty ( statistics ) : : :    the statistical uncertainty associated with the    @xmath0  determination . in situ light - jet calibration ( ijes ) : : :    that part of the jes uncertainty that originates from in situ    calibration procedures and is uncorrelated among the measurements . in    the combination reported here",
    ", it corresponds to the statistical    uncertainty associated with the jes determination using the    @xmath27 invariant mass in the cdf    @xmath8+jets , all  jets , and met measurements , and in the d0    run  ii @xmath10 and @xmath8+jets    measurements .",
    "residual jes uncertainties arising from effects not    considered in the in situ calibration are included in other    categories .",
    "for the d0 run  ii @xmath10 measurement , the    uncertainty coming from transferring the @xmath8+jets    calibration to the dilepton event topology is quoted in the _ light - jet    response ( 2 ) ( djes ) _ category described below .",
    "response to jets ( ajes ) : : :    that part of the jes uncertainty that originates from average    differences in detector electromagnetic over hadronic    ( @xmath28 ) response for hadrons produced in the fragmentation    of @xmath17-quark and light - quark jets .",
    "model for jets ( bjes ) : : :    that part of the jes uncertainty that originates from uncertainties    specific to the modeling of @xmath17 jets and that is    correlated across all measurements . for both cdf and d0",
    "this includes    uncertainties arising from variations in the semileptonic branching    fractions , @xmath17-fragmentation modeling , and differences in    the color flow between @xmath17-quark jets and light - quark    jets .",
    "these were determined from  studies but back - propagated to the    measurements , whose _ light - jet response ( 1 ) _ uncertainties ( _ rjes _ ,    see below ) were then corrected to keep the total jes uncertainty    constant .",
    "out - of - cone correction ( cjes ) : : :    that part of the jes uncertainty that originates from modeling    uncertainties correlated across all measurements .",
    "it specifically    includes the modeling uncertainties associated with light - quark    fragmentation and out - of - cone corrections .",

    "signal modeling ( signal ) : : :    the systematic uncertainty arising from uncertainties in    @xmath23  modeling that is correlated across all    measurements .",
    "this includes uncertainties from variations of the    amount of initial and final state radiation and from the choice of    parton density function used to generate the    @xmath23  monte carlo samples that calibrate each    method .",
    "when appropriate it also includes the uncertainty from    higher - order corrections evaluated from a comparison of    @xmath23  samples generated by mc@nlo  @xcite and    alpgen  @xcite , both interfaced to herwig  @xcite for the    simulation of parton showers and hadronization . in this combination ,    the systematic uncertainty arising from a variation of the    phenomenological description of color reconnection ( cr ) between final    state particles @xcite is included in the _ signal modeling _    category .",
    "the cr uncertainty is obtained by taking the difference    between the pythia6.4 tune  apro \" and the pythia6.4 tune  acrpro \" that    differ only in the cr model . in the latest analysis in the    @xmath8+jets channel",
    ", d0 uses the following samples : pythia    with perugia 2011 versus perugia 2011nocr tunes to estimate the    uncertainty due to the cr model .",
    "this uncertainty was not evaluated in    run  i since the monte carlo generators available at that time did not    allow for variations of the cr model .",
    "these measurements therefore do    not include this source of systematic uncertainty . finally , the    systematic uncertainty associated with variations of the mc generator    used to calibrate the mass extraction method is added .",

    "jet modeling ( detmod ) : : :    the systematic uncertainty arising from uncertainties in the modeling    of jet interactions in the detector in the mc simulation .",
    "for d0 , this    includes uncertainties from jet resolution and identification .    applying jet algorithms to mc events",
    ", cdf finds that the resulting    efficiencies and resolutions closely match those in data .",
    "the small    differences propagated to @xmath29    lead to a negligible uncertainty of 0.005  2 , which is then ignored .",

    "it is correlated between all measurements in the same    channel , and includes uncertainties on the background composition ,    normalization , and shape of different components , e.g. , the    uncertainties from the modeling of the @xmath19+jets background    in the @xmath8+jets channel associated with variations of    the factorization scale used to simulate @xmath19+jets events .",

    "offset ( un / mi ) : : :    this uncertainty is specific to d0 and includes the uncertainty    arising from uranium noise in the d0 calorimeter and from the multiple    interaction corrections to the jes . for d0  these uncertainties were    sizable , while for , owing to the shorter calorimeter electronics    integration time and in situ jes calibration , these uncertainties are    negligible",
    ". multiple interactions model ( mhi ) : : :    the systematic uncertainty arising from a mismodeling of the    distribution of the number of collisions per tevatron bunch crossing    owing to the steady increase in the collider instantaneous luminosity    during data - taking .",
