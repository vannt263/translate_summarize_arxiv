    "recently , hayashida et al . ( 1996 ) reported the possible clustering of some of the ultra high energy events of the agasa experiment .",
    "if these ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) are charged particles , protons as it is more likely , then these pairs impose severe constraints on the characteristics of the propagation region and/or their sources ( e.g. , cronin 1996 , sigl et al 1996 )",
    ". catastrophic extragalactic events , like @xmath1-ray bursts ( grb ) or the decay of topological defects ( td ) , which are able to produce the particles over a very short period of time , should only be consistent with the data for a suitable combination of low intergalactic magnetic field ( igmf ) and distance to the source",
    ". nevertheless , the stirring of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) by large agglomerates of galaxies , shocks excited in binary collisions of galaxies or the bow shocks preceding fast moving galaxies in dense igm environments are examples of quiescent sources that could produce chance pairings of uhecr events on the sky .",
    "if these quiescent sources are traced by the distribution of luminous matter in the nearby universe , which is known , then the probability of the corresponding chance pairing can be estimated and compared with the observations .    in this letter , the results of three different calculations are presented .",
    "first , the trajectories of the individual particles through the galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) are calculated for each pair under different assumptions for the gmf ( medina tanco et al , 1997a , medina tanco 1997a ) . in the case of catastrophic events ( i.e , almost simultaneous particle emission )",
    "this constrains the amount of time delay due to intergalactic propagation alone and , consequently , the range of igmf values and source distances allowed .",
    "the separation angle between the momenta of the particles at their arrival at the border of the halo , @xmath2 , can also be estimated .",
    "this is a matching condition that must be satisfied by the particle trajectories at the border of the halo .",
    "second , the same numerical scheme of medina tanco et al ( 1997b ) is used to estimate the arrival relative - deflection distribution function for some allowed combinations of igmf and distance to the source .",
    "the comparison of this distribution function with the previously calculated @xmath2 , gives a quantitative idea of the likelihood of the observed events being the result of point - like catastrophic sources .",
    "third , the actual distribution of extragalactic objects , as given by the cfa catalogue ( huchra et al 1995 ) , is assumed to track the uhecr sources and to modulate the intensity of the igmf .",
    "consequently , with the aid of numerical three dimensional simulations , an all - sky arrival probability distribution function of uhecr is built ( medina tanco 1997b , c ) and compared with the observations .",
    "three different codes are used in the present work .",
    "the first one allows the calculation of the trajectory of an uhecr particle of known mass and charge between the border of the galactic halo and the detector at earth",
    ". a complete description of the model can be found in medina tanco et al ( 1997a ) and medina tanco ( 1997a ) .",
    "the results depend , of course , on the model used to describe the large scale galactic magnetic field .",
    "this is certainly a largely unexplored area .",
    "however , we expect that a rough description , satisfactory for the present treatment , can be attained by the models of stanev ( 1997 ) .",
    "we adopt the same two extreme combinations of stanev ( 1997 ) ( see also sofue et al .",
    "1986 , beck et al , 1996 ) : ( 1 ) a bisymmetric gmf model with field reversals and odd parity ( bss - a ) and ( 2 ) an axisymmetric gmf model without reversals and with even parity ( ass - s ) .",
    "the effects of a small @xmath3 @xmath4 g component are also studied in each case .",
    "table 1 , adapted from hayashida et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , lists the proposed clusters of events .",
    "@xmath5 , is the arrival time delay .",
    "the pairs were classified as type a and b , according to the arrival order of the highest energy particle .",
    "only type a events , where the highest energy particle arrives first , can be originated in a bursting source in which the particles are simultaneously released . in type b events",
    "either the source is quiescent or there is a finite acceleration time involved that delays the production of the high energy particle .",
    "table 2 summarizes the results for pair 1 under different gmf configurations . for",
    "an almost simultaneous release of the particles at the sources , all the gmf configurations but one , imply that the source of pair 1 should lie inside the galactic halo .",
    "the maximum distance to the source for each one of these gmf models is indicated in column 3 . only the ass - s model without a @xmath6 component allows an extragalactic ( eg ) source . in the later case ,",
    "a maximum arrival time delay @xmath7 yr is left for the intergalactic portion of the trajectories of both particles .",
    "the arrival time delay between a proton of energy e and a photon can be estimated as :    @xmath8}\\ ] ]    ( c.f . , waxman and coppi , 1996 ) , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the intensity of the igmf , its correlation length and the distance to the source respectively .",
    "if the correlation length is known , eq . ( 1 ) can be used to estimate maximum igmf for a given @xmath11 and @xmath5 between two protons .",
    "two fiducial distances have been selected for quantification purposes : @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the maximum values of the igmf for these distances are listed in table 2 for @xmath14 mpc ( kronberg 1994 , 1996 ) .",
    "these are the constraints set upon the intergalactic propagation region and uhecr bursting sources by the observed pair 1 , after considering the propagation of the particles through gmf",
    ". however , another constraint must be satisfied : the angle between the momenta of the particles arriving at the border of the halo from the igm should be equal to the calculated @xmath2 in table 2 .    to this end ,",
    "numerical simulations ( medina tanco et al 1997b ) were carried out emulating the intergalactic propagation of the components of pair 1 .",
    "@xmath15 mpc is assumed , while igmf values and distances to the sources are those of table 2 .",
    "protons are injected at the sources with an @xmath16 spectrum and the energy losses included are redshift , pair production and photo - pion production ( berezinsky and grigoreva 1988 ) .",
    "the resulting distribution functions for the relative time delay and the arrival angle between the proton components of pair 1 are shown in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "the average time delay between both protons , as given by the simulations ( figure 1 ) , is consistent with equation ( 1 ) , although there is a considerable dispersion .",
    "furthermore , figure 2 shows that a @xmath17 separation , as inferred for pair 1 at the border of the halo , is at the wing of the distribution .",
    "therefore , if a bursting source were responsible for this pair , a very low probability event was observed indeed .",
    "pairs 2 and 3 are type b events .",
    "this means that a point source can not have emitted the uhecr simultaneously .",
    "therefore , if the point source hypothesis is to be maintained , we must assume either that the source is quiescent or , if bursting , that a finite acceleration time is involved which delays the emission of the high energy component . in this case",
    ", the sum of the arrival time delay and the time delay due to propagation through the gmf and igmf , is a lower limit to @xmath18 , the lifetime of the source .",
    "again , the galactic and intergalactic trajectories must verify the matching of @xmath2 at the galactic halo border .",
    "it is found that @xmath2(pair 2 ) @xmath19 and @xmath2(pair 3 ) @xmath20 , depending on the gmf model adopted .",
    "numerical simulations for the igm propagation of the proton components of pairs 2 and 3 are also shown in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "@xmath21 mpc , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 gauss , were used .",
    "the lower value of the igmf is the one imposed by a bursting pair 1 , and the second is the current upper limit for the igmf .",
    "it can be seen from figures 1 and 2 that , as for pair 1 , a @xmath24 gauss igmf leads to a very low probability for an event with @xmath2 on the order of a few degrees .",
    "taking into account the galactic propagation , the lower limits for the lifetime of single sources for pairs 2 and 3 , with @xmath25 gauss , are @xmath26 and @xmath27 yr respectively . on the other hand , from the point of view of @xmath2 , a consistent picture can be obtained for a higher value of the igmf , say near @xmath23 gauss .",
    "however , @xmath28 yr and so a single source should be quiescent and , probably , extended perhaps enclosing more than one galaxy in order to confine @xmath29 ev particles .",
    "the previous results seem to point to a chance clustering of the three pairs of events , despite the chance probability for the pairs quoted by hayashida et al .",
    "( 1996 ) being only 2.9% .",
    "we note , however , that this chance probability was derived under the assumption that the arrival direction distribution is uniform over the sky .",
    "this is arguable .",
    "several classes of potential extragalactic sources have been proposed ( e.g. , kewley et al 1996 , protheroe and johnson 1996 , biermann et al 1996 , halzen 1997 ) , and these are not uniformly distributed over the sky .",
    "the inhomogeneity of the source s distribution should be more noticeable because the interaction of uhecr with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) imposes an upper limit @xmath30 mpc .",
    "even if the actual sources are unknown , we can naively assume that they follow the distribution of galaxies ( i.e. , luminous matter ) in the nearby universe .",
    "this is compatible with isolated galaxies , interacting galaxies , galactic bowshocks in high density igms and extended sources in turbulent igms powered by concentrations of galaxies .",
    "except for some few observational determinations and upper limits ( e.g. , arp 1988 , kim et al .",
    "1989 , kronberg 1994 ) or numerical simulations of cosmological structure formation ( biermann 1996 and references there in ) we know very little about the igmf .",
    "these constraints , however , point to an igmf structure that follows the distribution of matter ( galaxies ) .",
    "therefore , a high degree of inhomogeneity can be expected , with relatively high values of @xmath31 over small regions ( @xmath32 mpc ) of high matter density ( c.f .",
    ", arp 1988 , kim et al .",
    "1989 ) , pervading vast low density / low @xmath31 regions with @xmath33 g.    following medina tanco et al ( 1997b ) , it is assumed that the uhecr are protons , and that their sources are extragalactic and hosted by , or associated with , normal galaxies .",
    "it is further assumed that the magnetic field scales as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the local density of galaxies as derived from the cfa redshift catalogue ( huchra et al 1995 ) .",
    "the igmf is considered as organised in cells of size @xmath10 of homogeneous field , such that the orientation of @xmath31 between adjacent cells is uncorrelated .",
    "@xmath10 relates to the igmf through the expression : @xmath36^{-2}$ ] , and the normalisation condition @xmath15 mpc for @xmath37 g is adopted .",
    "uhecr protons are injected at the galaxies with an energy spectrum @xmath38 and propagated non - diffusively through the above scenario , while loosing energy via redshift , pair production and photomeson production ( berezinsky and grigoreva 1988 ) .",
    "the results are displayed in the form of all - sky uhecr images of the celestial sphere for galaxies located at @xmath39 mpc ( figure 3.a ) and @xmath40 mpc ( figure 3.b ) for arriving protons with @xmath41 ev .",
    "these surfaces should be representative of the arrival probability of uhecr at the earth position in the galaxy .",
    "the curved lines bound the region of the sky where agasa is believed to be sensitive ( uchihori 1996 ) .",
    "we can see that the arrival probability is by no means isotropic .",
    "furthermore , pair 2 is on top of a maximum of the arrival probability for sources located between @xmath42 and @xmath43 mpc , while pair 1 is also located on a high arrival probability region for sources at more than @xmath43 mpc .",
    "this is in contrast with the chance probability estimated by hayashida et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and points to either different uncorrelated sources of the components of each pair , or to very extended quiescent sources involving several galaxies .",
    "we also note that the sensitivity of agasa is rather low in the vicinity of pairs 1 and 2 .",
    "therefore , an instrument with more uniform coverage ( like the proposed auger project ) should probably detect an extended region of excess uhecr flux at the position of the pairs .",
    "the third pair comes from a region of space where no large clustering of galaxies exist up to the depths considered .",
    "as the components can not have originated simultaneously at the same extragalactic source because of galactic propagation constraints , they must have come from isolated sources .",
    "this seems to indicate that very large agglomerates of galaxies , large enough to give a signature in figure 3 , are not needed in order to accelerate uhecr .",
    "the constraints deduced from the propagation of the components of the pairs of uhecr events proposed by hayashida et al ( 1996 ) through the galactic and intergalactic medium have been analysed .    in the case of pair 1 ,",
    "the low value of the igmf , imposed by the arrival time delay between the protons , is inconsistent with the deflection angle between the momenta of the particles at the border of the halo , inferred from their galactic propagation .",
    "this makes a single , bursting source very unlikely .",
    "if the components of pairs 2 and 3 originate in common sources , then the lifetimes of the sources are probably larger than few times @xmath44 yr and , therefore , extended . this picture is consistent with an igmf value not much smaller than the presently accepted upper limit of @xmath23 gauss ( kronberg 1996 ) and a distance to the sources of @xmath45 mpc .",
    "in fact , the actual distribution of galaxies ( huchra et al , 1995 ) presents a local maximum at about that distance in the direction of pair 2 .",
    "furthermore , our simulations point to a maximum in the arrival distribution of uhecr at exactly the same position of pair 2 , when sources between @xmath42 and @xmath43 mpc are considered .",
    "pair 1 is also located inside a maximum of the arrival distribution , favouring chance pairing between the components .",
    "figure 1 : distribution function of arrival time delays between the observed pair of protons in clusters 1 , 2 and 3 due to propagation in the igmf alone ( i.e. , at the external border of the galactic ) .",
    "the simulations for pair 1 correspond to the two fiducial scenarios of table 2 , and match the constrain in time delay imposed by the galactic portion of the tracks : @xmath46 g and @xmath12 mpc ( dotted line ) and @xmath22 g and @xmath21 mpc ( continuous line ) . for pairs 2 ( broken - dotted line ) and 3 ( broken line ) two possible scenarios are explored : @xmath21 mpc and @xmath47 g and @xmath48 g.    figure 2 : distribution function of the angle between the momenta of the observed particles in each pair , at their arrival at the external border of the galactic halo after propagation through the igmf .",
    "the conditions are the same as in figure 1",
    ". also indicated is a separation angle of @xmath49 typically obtained from the calculations of galactic propagation for all the three pairs .",
    "figure 3 : arrival distribution of uhecr simulated under the assumption that the luminous matter in the nearby universe tracks the distribution of the sources of uhecr , and modulates the intensity of the igmf ( see text for details ) .",
    "redshift , pair production and photo - pion production losses are included .",
    "the arrival distributions due to sources at two different depths are shown : ( a ) @xmath50 mpc , ( b ) @xmath40 mpc .",
    "pairs 1 and 2 lie on top of regions of high arrival probability strengthening the possibility of chance pairing .",
