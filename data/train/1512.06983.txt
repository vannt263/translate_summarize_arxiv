    "the adiabatic theorem for isolated quantum systems is a basic principle of the quantum dynamics : once the system is prepared to be in a stationary state , the system remains to be stationary as long as the parameters of the system are varied slow enough .",

    ", we examine how the final stationary state of the adiabatic time evolution depends on the path in the adiabatic parameter space . in particular , we here focus on the eigenspaces corresponding to the initial and final stationary states , and we will ignore the phase information in the following . first , we will show that the final stationary state generally depends on the adiabatic path , although the initial adiabatic parameter and initial stationary state are kept fixed .",
    "it turns out that the topology of the adiabatic path plays the key role there .",
    "second , we will show that the discrepancy between two final stationary states corresponding to two different adiabatic path is characterized by a permutation matrix , which is governed by a homotopy equivalence .",
    "our idea is an application of the topological formulation for the exotic quantum holonomy  @xcite , which concerns the nontrivial change in eigenspaces induced by adiabatic cycles  @xcite .",
    "the present argument heavily relies on topology , in particular the concept of homotopy and its application to the covering map . at the same time , our argument is formal in the sense of mathematics . since our argument relies only on an elementally account of homotopy and covering map , we refer textbooks of topology for more mathematical description  @xcite . the covering map",

    "here we assume that @xmath26 is a normal covering map , which is equivalent to the condition that @xmath72 is independent of @xmath74 ( proposition 11.35 in ref .",

    "these result concern with the group @xmath75 consists of all possible @xmath65}$ ] for an arbitrary closed path @xmath60 . in the theory of covering map ,",
    "@xmath75 is called a covering automorphism group , and the above result is just the one - to - one correspondence between @xmath75 and @xmath72 ( theorem 12.7 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",

    "we examine a slowly modulated periodically driven systems in this section . here a modification of the adiabatic theorem is required for the stationary states that are described by by eigenvectors of a floquet operator  @xcite .",
    "we choose the periodically driven systems instead of slowly driven hamiltonian systems because the examples in the latter case requires either the divergence or crossing of eigenenergies , as is seen in the studies of exotic quantum holonomy  @xcite .",
    "we refer ref .",
    "@xcite to apply the present formulation for adiabatic paths that involves level crossings .",
    "we compare an arbitrary pair @xmath79 of two adiabatic paths in a two level system , where we suppose that the absence of spectral degeneracy in the adiabatic paths .",
    "after we lay out our result using a parameterization that is suitable to examine the path topology dependence , of two level systems , we will show an example of nontrivial pair of paths @xmath79 using a quantum map .    first , we parameterize the adiabatic path using the set of eigenprojections @xmath80 and @xmath81 @xmath82 where the order of the projectors are ignored .",

    "this amount to the parameterization of adiabatic path by floquet operator through the spectral decomposition @xmath84 where @xmath85 is @xmath86-th eigenvalue ( @xmath87 ) , since non - degenerate floquet operator @xmath44 uniquely specifies @xmath83 .",
