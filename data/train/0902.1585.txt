    "recently ideas proposed by lee and wick  @xcite were used to extend the standard model so that it does not contain quadratic divergences in the higgs mass @xcite .",
    "higher derivative kinetic terms are added for each of the standard model fields .",
    "they improve the convergence of feynman diagrams and result in a theory where there are no quadratically divergent radiative corrections to the higgs mass .",
    "the higher derivative terms give rise to propagators with new poles that are massive resonances . these lee - wick ( lw )",
    "resonances have wrong - sign kinetic terms which naively give rise to unacceptable instabilities and violations of unitarity .",
    "lee and wick  @xcite and cutkowski _ et al . _",
    "( clop ) @xcite proposed a way of defining the integrations that arise in feynman diagrams so that the theory is unitary , lorentz invariant , and free of instabilities .",
    "however , there is acausal behavior caused by the unusual location of poles in the propagators .",
    "physically this acausality is associated with the future boundary condition needed to forbid the exponentially growing modes . as long",
    "as the masses and widths of the lw resonances are large enough , this acausality does not manifest itself on macroscopic scales and is not in conflict with scattering experiments .",
    "various aspects of this model @xcite , its extensions @xcite and of lee - wick theories in general @xcite have been explored in the recent literature .",
    "collider phenomenology @xcite , constraints from electroweak precision measurement @xcite and the cosmology of theories with higher derivatives @xcite have also been studied .    in this paper",
    "we examine the high temperature behavior of lee - wick theories , including the lw standard model . in these theories",
    "the @xmath8-matrix can be calculated in perturbation theory using the prescriptions of lee and wick and clop .",
    "it is unclear whether a functional integral formulation of lw theory exists , so a computation of finite temperature effects solely based on the known s matrix is desired .",
    "the formalism of dashen , ma and bernstein ( dmb ) @xcite expresses the thermodynamic grand potential in terms of the @xmath8-matrix and we apply it to lw theories to deduce the pressure and energy density for these theories at finite temperature . although previous analyses have argued that in scattering experiments no acausal effects persist to macroscopic scales , it is interesting to examine whether this is possible when multiple scattering effects play a role .",
    "this is the case for thermal equilibrium and we explore the propagation of sound waves in a gas consisting of ordinary and lee - wick particles . we find that in such a gas , at a large ( but finite ) temperature , sound waves propagate at a speed less than light .    in the next section we review scattering in a simple scalar lee - wick theory .",
    "section 3 uses the dmb formalism to calculate , in this toy model , the energy density and pressure at thermal equilibrium . at high temperatures @xmath9",
    "we find that the lw resonance contributes minus what an ordinary particle of mass @xmath2 would .",
    "we use our results to conclude that as @xmath10 the speed of sound approaches @xmath11 from below .",
    "this gives in the limit @xmath10 a speed of sound equal to the speed of light and is the largest value consistent with causal propagation of classical sound waves in the gas .",
    "concluding remarks are made in section 4 .",
    "in this section we introduce a simple lee - wick theory with a single self - interacting real scalar field .",
    "in addition to the standard kinetic term there is a higher derivative term .",
    "the lagrangian density is @xmath12 so the propagator of @xmath13 in momentum space is given by @xmath14 for @xmath15 , this propagator has poles at @xmath16 and also at @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the propagator describes more than one degree of freedom .",
    "we can make these new degrees of freedom manifest in the lagrangian density in a simple way .",
    "first , let us introduce an auxiliary scalar field @xmath18 , so that we can write the theory as @xmath19 next , we define @xmath20 . in terms of this variable , after integrating by parts , the lagrangian density becomes @xmath21 in this form , it is clear that there are two kinds of scalar fields : a normal scalar field @xmath22 and a new field @xmath18 , which we will refer to as a lw field .",
    "the sign of the quadratic lagrangian of the lw field is opposite to the usual sign so one may worry about stability of the theory , even at the classical level .",
    "we will return to this point .",
    "if we ignore , for simplicity , the mass @xmath23 , the propagator of @xmath18 is given by @xmath24 the lw field is associated with a non - positive definite norm on the hilbert space , as indicated by the unusual sign of its propagator .",
    "consequently , if this state were to be stable , unitarity of the @xmath8-matrix would be violated .",
    "however , as emphasized by lee and wick , unitarity and lorentz invariance can be preserved provided that @xmath18 may decay .",
    "this is natural in the theory described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : scalarthy ] ) because @xmath25 is heavy and can decay into two @xmath22 particles .    in the presence of the mass @xmath23",
    ", there is a mixing between the scalar field @xmath22 and the lw scalar @xmath18 .",
    "we can diagonalize this mixing without spoiling the diagonal form of the derivative terms by performing a hyperbolic rotation of the fields : @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "this transformation diagonalizes the lagrangian if @xmath28 a solution for the angle @xmath29 exists provided @xmath30 .",
    "the lagrangian density   describing the system becomes @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the masses of the diagonalized fields and @xmath34 . in what follows",
    "we assume that @xmath15 , so that @xmath35 .",
    "introducing the lw fields makes the physics of the theory clear .",
    "there are two fields ; the heavy lw scalar decays to lighter scalars . at loop level",
    ", the presence of the heavier scalar improves the convergence of loop graphs at high energy consistent with our expectations from the higher derivative form of the theory .",
    "loop corrections to the two point function of the lw field play a crucial role . near @xmath36 and at small",
    "@xmath37 the @xmath38 mixing can be neglected and the full lw @xmath25 propagator and its perturbative expansion are given by @xmath39 \\frac{-i}{p^2 - m^2}+\\cdots \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\frac{-i}{p^2 - m^2 - \\sigma(p^2 ) } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that , unlike for ordinary scalars , there is a minus sign in front of the self - energy @xmath40 in the denominator .",
    "the pole mass shift of the lw scalar coming from the radiative corrections is @xmath41 .",
    "this sign is significant ; for example , from a one - loop computation we see that the imaginary part of the self energy is @xmath42 therefore the propagator develops a pole for @xmath43 . in the narrow width approximation",
    "the propagator for the lw field is @xmath44 where @xmath45 this width differs in sign from widths of the usual unstable particles we encounter . strictly speaking the propagator has an additional pole at @xmath46 and a cut over the real axis ; however , the effect of these two terms in the below calculation of the pressure and energy density at finite temperature cancel one another so we ignore them .    using the lee and wick and clop prescriptions the @xmath8-matrix in this theory is unitary and lorentz invariant on the space of physical ordinary @xmath22 particles .",
    "the contour of integration over @xmath47 in this prescription does not lead to any instability , as one may naively guess from the negative sign in the width , but instead leads to apparently acausal behavior .",
    "this has been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "the lw resonance @xmath18 is unstable and therefore does not appear in the initial or final states of the @xmath8-matrix .",
    "this is similar to the case of the @xmath48-boson of the standard model , which does not appear in initial or final states of @xmath8-matrix elements because it is unstable - boson two point function , just a cut that is represented as a pole in the narrow width approximation .",
    "however , for the lee - wick @xmath18 resonance there is actually a pair of negative residue poles in the complex plane in addition to the usual cut . ] .",
    "nonetheless , the @xmath18 resonance impacts the scattering of ordinary @xmath22 particles @xmath49 , particularly near the kinematic point @xmath50 .",
    "writing @xmath51 , the @xmath52 matrix can be computed using the standard feynman techniques , modified appropriately for lee - wick theories .",
    "dmb introduce a closely related quantity @xmath53 that has two particle matrix elements @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 is essentially the usual invariant matrix element .",
    "for center of mass energies near @xmath2 the invariant matrix element is given ( in the narrow resonance approximation ) by rather than in phase space integrations . ]",
    "@xmath58 note that this differs from scattering via the exchange of an ordinary ( _ i.e. _ , not lw ) resonance by an overall minus sign and the fact that @xmath59 given by eq .",
    "( [ lwg ] ) is negative .",
    "the grand partition function @xmath60 at zero chemical potential is defined by @xmath61 where @xmath62 and the trace is over all physical states in the theory . in our toy model",
    "the physical states are the @xmath22 particle states but not states that contain a lw resonance . from @xmath60",
    "one can calculate the thermal equilibrium pressure @xmath1 and energy density @xmath63 in the usual fashion using formulas @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the volume of the system .",
    "dmb derive the following expression for the grand potential @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes that only connected diagrams are taken into account . in eq .",
    "( [ grandpotential ] ) the @xmath8-matrix is given by @xmath68 , @xmath69 is the free particle grand potential and @xmath70 is an operator that sums over permutations of the identical particles in the trace with the appropriate minus signs for fermions .",

    "it is convenient to use the phase space relation @xmath73 where the primed variables are the center of mass momenta and energies , @xmath74 and @xmath75 . in order to calculate the first term of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ dmb ] ) we notice that . ]",
    "@xmath76 so the expression we need to evaluate is @xmath77 using @xmath78 and the phase space relation ( [ phasespace ] ) gives @xmath79 now , recall that @xmath80 is the total energy - momentum four - vector of the states in the trace while @xmath81 is the corresponding energy - momentum four - vector in the center of mass frame .",
    "they are related by a boost with a lorentz gamma factor @xmath82 .",
    "one can go from one set of variables to the other . using the relation",
    "@xmath83 we have that @xmath84 and so the integrations over @xmath85 become the standard two body phase space integration .",
    "we arrive at the result @xmath86 finally , we change from the variable @xmath87 to @xmath88 in all other places . using @xmath89 and interchanging the order of the two integrations we get @xmath90 where @xmath91 the term with @xmath92 gives the same contribution to @xmath60 but with @xmath93 substituted by @xmath94 . in calculating the second term of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ dmb ] ) we use the same methods as previously .",

    "the above formula is the same as one would get for scattering through an ordinary resonance except in that case @xmath59 is positive .",
    "therefore , in the narrow lw resonance approximation @xmath103 hence , the contribution to the grand potential from the single lw resonance is @xmath104 this is precisely what one would expect from a stable particle of mass @xmath2 , except for the overall plus sign instead of a minus .",
    "note that the narrow width approximation is valid provided the prefactor in the integral over @xmath88 is slowly varying .",
    "this will be the case provided @xmath105 .",
    "thus far we have only included two particle states in the calculation of the trace for the grand potential , with a resonant s matrix from eq .",
    "contributions to the trace from states with more than two particle introduce multiple resonance amplitudes .",
    "this has two effects @xcite : they modify the width , as expected for decays in a thermal bath , and they convert the exponential factor to the usual bose - einstein logarithm . in the narrow width approximation",
    "the modified width is still narrow , that is , proportional to @xmath106 , and hence it still vanishes as @xmath107 .",
    "the bose - einstein logarithm arises from considering multiple resonance graphs that are connected only because of the permutation operator @xmath70 .",
    "this gives @xmath108 which is minus the contribution of a boson of mass @xmath2 to the ideal gas grand potential .",
    "note that this result is valid for arbitrarily large temperatures , which is not the case for non - elementary ( composite ) resonances @xcite .",
    "since in the narrow width approximation the lw resonance contributes minus what an ordinary scalar particle of mass @xmath2 would , in our toy model the lw contribution to the energy density is @xmath109 + \\ldots,\\ ] ] while the contribution to the pressure is @xmath110 + \\ldots.\\ ] ] here the ellipses stand for terms of order @xmath111 at most and are less important than those explicitly displayed when @xmath9 .",
    "adding these to the positive contributions from the ordinary scalar ( whose mass @xmath23 we neglect ) @xmath112 gives @xmath113 and @xmath114 a similar analysis holds for theories with a left handed fermion and its lw partner .",
    "this is most easily seen in the higher derivative formulation of the theory . in",

    "the absence of a term linear in t for the fermion pressure and density is as in the normal case . adding the lw fermion contribution to the ordinary fermion energy density and pressure @xmath118 gives @xmath119 and @xmath120 from the above formulas for the pressure and energy density one can calculate the factor @xmath121 in the equation of state @xmath122 to be @xmath123\\ \\ \\ { \\rm for\\ bosons},\\nonumber \\\\ & & w=1+{\\cal o}\\left[\\frac{{\\rm ln}(t)}{t^2}\\right ] \\ \\ \\ { \\rm for\\ fermions}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in figure 1 we plot @xmath124 for both cases as a function of @xmath125 .",

    "there is a lw partner for every ordinary particle .",
    "hence , at high temperatures above all the lw masses the pressure and energy density are approximately proportional to @xmath133 , which implies the same equation of state @xmath6 .",

    "we have studied in this paper lee - wick theories at high temperature . making use of the @xmath8-matrix formulation of statistical mechanics presented in dmb @xcite , we calculated the grand thermodynamical potential for a gas of lee - wick resonances in the boson and fermion case .",
    "we found that the contribution of lee - wick resonances to the energy density and pressure is negative for high temperatures .",
    "next , we considered a gas of both ordinary and lee - wick particles .",
