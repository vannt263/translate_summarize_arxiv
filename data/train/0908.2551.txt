    "since the first experimental observations @xcite of bose - einstein condensation in dilute alkali gases , much interest has been directed to the study of quantum vortices in such systems , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "on one hand , dilute condensates offer an opportunity to gain insight into the physics of superfluids and vortices familiar from condensed - matter systems .",
    "the weakly interacting nature of dilute condensates makes them amenable to _ tractable _ theoretical approaches , complementing the precision of control and observation afforded by dilute atomic - gas experiments @xcite",
    ". however , there are also marked differences between the vortex physics of dilute condensates and that of bulk superfluids .",
    "in contrast to bulk superfluids , dilute condensates have inhomogeneous density profiles , leading to new vortex physics @xcite .",
    "furthermore the behavior of dilute gas condensates is in many cases subtly different to that expected from experience with bulk superfluids : examples are the much slower collision rates in the dilute condensates , resulting in the breakdown of two - fluid hydrodynamics @xcite , and the essential role of dynamical instabilities in the formation of vortex lattices in stirred condensates @xcite .",
    "early numerical investigations by butts and rokhsar @xcite revealed some of the the nature of the rotating condensates at zero temperature .",
    "as in bulk superfluids @xcite , dilute condensates seek to mimic rigid - body rotation @xcite by acquiring vortices in a regular array .",
    "condensates adjust their rotation both by undergoing discontinuous phase transitions @xcite between rotational - symmetry classes by nucleating additional vortices , and also by adjusting their vortex distributions within a symmetry class . at a critical imposed rotation frequency , the ground state of the system makes a transition from an irrotational , vortex - free state to a central - vortex state @xcite , with angular momentum per atom @xmath0 .",
    "this transition is continuous , and the system possesses a continuum of off - axis vortex states with @xmath1 . unlike the stationary @xmath2 and @xmath3 states , these intermediate states are not ground states in any rotating frame @xcite , and are thermodynamically unstable in all frames .",
    "however , they are dynamically stable , and at zero temperature the vortex follows a stable orbit about the trap center .",
    "such states represent the simplest nontrivial example of vortex dynamics in bec .",
    "the precession of such a vortex can be viewed as the vortex being carried by its own _ self - induced _",
    "superflow @xcite , arising due to the effective boundary conditions imposed on the superflow by the inhomogeneity of the condensate orbital density @xcite .",
    "corrections to this picture due to the finite extent of the vortex core have been investigated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "further complexity is attained in finite - temperature scenarios , where the vortex may be subject to additional forces resulting from its interaction with the thermal field @xcite .",
    "if the angular velocity of the thermal cloud is different from that of the vortex , the vortex experiences a frictional force which causes it to drift radially . for thermal - cloud angular velocities below some threshold @xcite",
    ", this interaction induces the expulsion of the vortex from the condensate @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of a vortex at finite temperature are of interest both as a test of theories of finite - temperature condensates @xcite , and for understanding the nature of vortex interactions with bulk thermal flows , which has proved a controversial issue @xcite . in this paper",
    "we realize finite - temperature precessing single - vortex states as _ equilibrium _ configurations of a conserving ( hamiltonian ) classical - field system @xcite , with fixed internal energy and angular momentum . such hamiltonian classical - field methods and closely related stochastic - field methods @xcite have proven useful both in equilibrium and nonequilibrium scenarios @xcite . working at fixed angular momentum",
    "allows us to create rotational - symmetry - broken precessing - vortex states at finite - temperature equilibrium of the classical field . in such configurations , the vortex is at rotational equilibrium with the thermal cloud , and the dissipative force responsible for vortex decay @xcite vanishes .",
    "we extract the symmetry - broken condensate orbital from the classical - field equilibrium , and observe both the goldstone mode associated with breaking rotational symmetry , and the filling of the vortex core by the thermal component of the field . increasing the field energy at fixed angular momentum",
    "we observe an increase in vortex precession radius and frequency , ultimately leading to the expulsion of the vortex from the condensate and the decoupling of the condensate rotation from that of the thermal cloud .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] we introduce the formalism we use in this work , and discuss its interpretation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulation_procedure ] , we discuss our simulation procedure , introducing in turn the parameters of our system , and the details of our numerical approach . in sec .  [",
    "sec : results ] we present results of representative simulations , and discuss techniques used in the extraction of physical information from the simulation trajectories . in sec .",
    "[ sec : energy_dependence ] we discuss the dependence of the system behavior on the internal energy of the field , and in sec .  [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize and present our conclusions .",
    "in this paper we employ classical - field - theory techniques , which have recently been reviewed at length in @xcite . here",
    "we recapitulate the basic elements of the hamiltonian classical field method , and briefly discuss the appropriate interpretation of its application here .    at its simplest level , classical - field theory results from the replacement of a second - quantized ( bose ) field hamiltonian with its classical analogue .",
    "this is motivated by the observation that in regimes of thermal behavior , the dominant characteristic of the atomic bose - field system is its multimode , self - interacting nature .",
    "indeed , under conditions of high mode occupation , field commutators become relatively unimportant , and a satisfactory description of the bosonic field can be obtained from a classical - field model .",
    "more generally , the dynamics of the classical - wave system itself are both of intrinsic interest @xcite , and able also to provide qualitative insight into the _ dynamics _ of degenerate bose - gas systems in scenarios where a precise identification of the method with the many - body field theory is impractical @xcite . in the present work we consider a closed , hamiltonian system , with fixed angular momentum .",
    "this allows us to characterize the motion of a quantum vortex _ at equilibrium _ with a rotating thermal component of the field .",
    "the essential ingredient of the classical - field method as developed and refined by davis , blakie and co - workers @xcite is the projection operator . while the classical dynamics of infinite - dimensional systems is able to be perfectly well - defined ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the projection operator restricts the system to a finite number of degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "this projection reduces the dynamics of the field to a finite hamiltonian system , suitable for numerical implementation .",
    "furthermore it acts to regularize the divergences resulting from the contact scattering potential assumed in the field theory @xcite , such that a formal renormalization can then be performed if so desired @xcite .",
    "the finite - dimensional hamiltonian system so obtained exhibits ergodic behavior @xcite , and this provides a useful tool for analyzing the equilibrium properties of bose - gas systems . by time - averaging functionals of the projected field along a sufficiently long field trajectory ,",
    "one expects to obtain their mean values in the microcanonical ensemble of field configurations satisfying the constraints of the conserved first integrals of the system @xcite .",
    "these mean values then serve as estimates of the analogous quantum - statistical - mechanical correlations of the many - body quantum system . with a careful choice of projector ,",
    "the classical ( equipartitioned ) equilibrium distribution can be chosen to be coincident with the high - occupation limit of the true bosonic system , allowing for highly accurate estimates to be made for the quantum system @xcite .",
    "the utility of the classical - field method in its application to dynamical systems is its ability to include the effects of such _ thermal _ behavior _ nonperturbatively _ in the description of the ` macroscopic ' dynamics of the field @xcite .",
    "the coherent fraction s evolution is influenced by the ( locally ) thermal behavior of the incoherent fraction , including both mean - field repulsion and dissipative effects in its resulting dynamics .",
    "the coupled dynamics of the two components are described also in the method of @xcite , with the crucial difference that in the classical - field approach no distinction between condensed and thermal material is made in deriving equations of motion or implementing their solution numerically .",
    "instead the condensate is identified _ a posteriori _ from the fluctuation statistics of the field .    in this work , while we wish to study the behavior of the classical - field system at equilibrium , there is an essential _ dynamical _ aspect to the equilibrium , i.e. , the precession of the vortex .",
    "our interest is in the dynamics of the vortex , and thus of the condensate , in the presence of the thermal component of the field .",
    "we thus follow @xcite in employing the classical - field method to include the effects of the thermal component of the field on the motion of a collective excitation of the condensate .",
    "in contrast to that work the collective excitation we study here ( the precession of the vortex ) is stable at thermal equilibrium of the system . the equilibrium trajectory of the vortex , which is determined by the balance of coherent and thermal forces acting on it , defines the frame in which the rotational - symmetry - broken condensate mode is stationary .",
    "the ergodic character of the field evolution tends to restore this broken rotational symmetry as time progresses , and we are thus lead to abandon formal ergodic averages and consider the coherence properties of the field on short time scales , as we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "we consider here a system harmonically trapped with a trapping potential isotropic in the @xmath4  plane : @xmath5.\\ ] ] we choose highly oblate harmonic trapping , with trapping frequency @xmath6 sufficiently high that no modes are excited in the @xmath7-direction .",
    "a two - dimensional ( 2d ) description is thus valid provided that @xcite , @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the system chemical potential and temperature respectively ( see also the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . restricting the system to 2d permits the dynamics of a _ point _ vortex interacting with the thermal component of the field to be studied , while removing complexities such as line bending and kelvin - wave excitations of a vortex filament of finite extent , which provide additional mechanisms for vortex dissipation @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we choose physical parameters corresponding to @xmath11 atoms confined in a strongly oblate trap , with trapping frequencies @xmath12 rad / s .",
    "the s - wave scattering length is @xmath13 nm , placing our system in the quasi-2d regime ( @xmath14 ) , with an effective 2d interaction parameter @xmath15 . in our simulations we will often compare our systems to what we will refer to as our principal _ ground state _ , which we take as the ground gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) eigenmode @xcite of the trapped system in a frame rotating at angular velocity @xmath16 , with eigenvalue @xmath17 in that frame .",
    "this state consists of @xmath18 atoms , and contains a single on - axis vortex carrying unit angular momentum per atom ( angular momentum and rotation will always refer to that about the @xmath7  axis in this paper ) .",
    "in an inertial ( non - rotating ) frame this state has eigenvalue @xmath19 , and energy @xmath20 . in this paper",
    "we will refer generically to any such inertial frame as a laboratory frame ( lab frame ) .      to derive the classical - field equation of motion , we begin with the second - quantized hamiltonian of a trapped bose gas in the @xmath21-wave regime @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the bosonic field operator satisfying @xmath24=\\delta(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}')$ ] , and the interaction is assumed to be a contact potential with @xmath25 , @xmath26 the scattering length and @xmath27 the atomic mass .",
    "we choose to write the hamiltonian in a frame rotating at angular velocity @xmath28 about the @xmath7  axis . as",
    "the interaction potential is rotationally invariant this choice affects only the definition of the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath29 we introduce a cutoff energy @xmath30 , delimiting a low - energy region ( @xmath31 ) of the system consisting of single - particle modes [ eigenmodes of eq .",

    "this division is enforced formally by the projection operator defined @xmath34 where summation is over all single - particle modes satisfying @xmath35 .",
    "we refer to the number of such modes spanning the low - energy region as the condensate - band multiplicity ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "we use this projector to define the projected field operator @xmath37 we choose the cutoff such that @xmath38 , and thus all excited @xmath7-axis modes are excluded from the low - energy basis over which @xmath39 is expanded .",
    "a classical theory is obtained by demoting the operators @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : proj_field_opr ] ) to classical variables @xmath41 , thereby defining a projected classical field @xmath42 .",
    "the corresponding classical - field hamiltonian is @xmath43 which is formally a classical hamiltonian with @xmath44 canonical degrees of freedom @xmath45 related to the field variables @xmath46 by a canonical transformation @xcite .",
    "it then follows that the hamilton s equations can be expressed in terms of projected functional differentiation of the classical - field hamiltonian @xcite as @xmath47 which is the projected gross - pitaevskii equation ( pgpe ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the conservation of field energy @xmath48=h_\\mathrm{cf}$ ] and normalization @xmath49 under the action of the pgpe follow immediately from the nature of @xmath50 as a time - invariant classical hamiltonian , and its invariance under the transformation @xmath51 respectively @xcite .",
    "furthermore the rotational invariance of the hamiltonian @xmath50 implies that the angular momentum @xmath52 [ where the bar denotes spatial averaging : @xmath53 is also conserved by the evolution of the pgpe .",
    "for the purpose of the implementation of the pgpe , it is convenient to express the physical quantities @xmath54 in a dimensionless form , which we write as @xmath55 .",

    "davis , blakie and co - workers have shown @xcite that the pgpe can be used to evolve a general configuration of the classical field to a thermal equilibrium .",
    "in contrast to those works , in which the initial field configurations were parameterized solely by their energies @xmath76\\equiv h_{\\mathrm{cf}}[\\psi ] = \\int d^2\\mathbf{x}\\ ; \\psi^*(\\mathbf{x } ) h_{\\mathrm{sp } }   \\psi(\\mathbf{x } ) + \\frac{u_\\mathrm{2d}}{2 } |\\psi(\\mathbf{x})|^4,\\ ] ] in this work we also fix the conserved angular momentum @xmath77",

    ", we investigate the thermal equilibria that result when atoms are thermally excited out of the ground condensate mode , while conserving the total angular momentum .      in applying our classical - field method , we must make a choice of the rotation rate of the frame in which the pgpe is defined , which we will denote by @xmath80 in the remainder of this paper .",
    "the only non - trivial consequence of this choice @xcite is the precise definition of the projector @xmath81 , and thus of the set of modes which span the low - energy space @xmath31 .",
    "this dependence of the projector on @xmath80 generalizes the familiar concept of an energy cutoff in classical - field theory .",
    "as is well known @xcite , the thermodynamic parameters of the classical field at equilibrium depend both on the conserved first integrals of the system and the imposed cutoff . in the present work",
    ", we expect that the equilibrium of the system minimizes the free energy @xmath82 where the thermodynamic angular velocity @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "the utility of the rotationally invariant ( gauss - laguerre ) projector used here is that the classical field evolution is not _ dynamically _ biased towards a particular rotating frame @xcite , i.e. , we retain a ( generalized ) ehrenfest relation @xcite @xmath84 for the angular momentum @xmath85 .",
    "this ensures that for the isotropic trapping we consider here , angular momentum is conserved , and further that the field is free to rotate at the angular velocity @xmath28 which minimizes eq .",

    "the relationship between the first integrals @xmath86 and the thermodynamic variables @xmath87 of course depends on @xmath80 , as different choices of cutoff yield different hamiltonian systems .",
    "we demonstrate this dependence by explicit calculation in appendix  [ app : appendixa ] , and note that the use of a harmonic basis allows the pgpe theory to be extended to include a mean - field description of above - cutoff atoms , whereby insensitivity to ( moderate ) changes in the cutoff is regained ( see @xcite ) . however ,",
    "as a first application to the precessing - vortex system , we restrict our attention to a strictly hamiltonian `` pgpe system '' @xcite , with low - energy region @xmath31 defined by application of the projector in the frame in which the ground state was formed ( i.e. , we take @xmath88 ) , and investigate the behavior of this particular hamiltonian system by varying its energy at fixed angular momentum .      for almost any initial configuration",
    "far from equilibrium , we expect the field to approach equilibrium over time @xcite , due to the ergodicity of the system .",
    "we thus form our initial states as randomized field configurations under the projector defined by cutoff energy @xmath89 and rotation frequency @xmath90 , with the same values of normalization @xmath91 and angular momentum @xmath92 as our principal ground state , but with higher energies .",
    "these states are essentially formed by ` mixing ' a randomized high - energy state with the principal ground state in a procedure similar to that described in @xcite .",
    "the initial - state information will persist in the precise details of the fluctuations @xcite since the field equations are deterministic , although reversibility of the evolution is lost after some time to numerical error @xcite .",
    "the values of the conserved first integrals @xmath92 and @xmath93 are fixed to the desired values to within specified tolerances ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "we form initial states in this manner with a range of energies . in each case",
    "the central vortex of the principal ground state remains , however the density profile of each state is severely distorted .",
    "as all our states have @xmath95 , the inertial - frame and projector - frame energies are in each case related by a constant shift resulting from the fixed rotational kinetic energy of the field : @xmath96 .",
    "this shift is of order @xmath97 for the ground - state wavefunction . in this paper",
    "we will discuss the energies of states in the _ lab frame _ , and quote them as a multiple of the ground - state energy @xmath98 in that frame .",
    "having formed the initial states we evolve them in the projector frame for a period of @xmath99 trap cycles , with an adaptive integrator @xcite with accuracy chosen such that the relative change in field normalization is @xmath100 per time step taken @xcite . by @xmath101 trap cycles the states have reached equilibrium , as evidenced by the settling of the distribution of particles in momentum space @xcite , and we perform our analysis of steady - state properties on the final @xmath102 trap cycles of evolution data .",
    "after the equilibration period , the behavior of the classical field simulations is qualitatively similar for energies in the range @xmath103e_\\mathrm{g}$ ] .",
    "each exhibits a central high - density region containing a vortex which is displaced off and precessing about the trap axis .",
    "viewed in the lab frame , the precession is in the same sense as the vortex ( i.e. positive rotation sense , corresponding to angular - momentum numbers @xmath104 ) , and is stochastic in nature , with the vortex position fluctuating about a circular mean orbit , in the presence of strong density fluctuations of the background field . as noted in sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : choice_of_frame ] , the frequency of the vortex precession is in general not equal to the angular velocity of the projector defining the microcanonical system . the condensate is located entirely in the central bulk ( see sec .  [",

    "we observe that the radius at which the vortex precesses increases as the energy of the field is increased . at higher energies it approaches the edge of the condensate and at @xmath106",
    "it is ultimately lost into the violently evolving peripheral region of surface excitations and short - lived phase defects . as the field energy is decreased",
    ", the vortex approaches the trap center .",
    "however , we expect that as the energy of the field is lowered towards the ground state , the excitation becomes too weak to reliably generate thermal statistics on the time scales of interest , and we suspect that for low energies the background field ` seen ' by the vortex may not appear thermal on the time scale of its precession .",
