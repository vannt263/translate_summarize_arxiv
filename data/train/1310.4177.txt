    "there is significant overlap between the different categories of sdss galaxies , so we are unable to discriminate between sf galaxies and agn using combinations of blended emission lines .    a final alternate to the bpt diagram , the mass - excitation ( mex ) diagram @xcite , is useful as we directly measure the necessary lines ( [ oiii ] and @xmath16 ) and derive stellar mass with sed fitting , which we show in the right panel of figure [ fig : bpt ] .",
    "the solid black lines are their empirical divisions between sf , composite , and agn , which are valid up to @xmath96 .",
    "we include the sdss categories , using stellar masses from the mpa / jhu value - added catalogs @xcite , to demonstrate that while the separation is not as clean as the traditional bpt diagram , it does separate sf galaxies from agn in the local universe .",
    "our data are consistent with the sf region as defined by @xcite , though the data do lie on the division boundary .",
    "however , work by @xcite at @xmath55 has shown that the low redshift empirical divisions in the mex diagram incorrectly classify @xmath55 sf galaxies as agn .",
    "they use the shift in the mass - metallicity relation between @xmath95 and 2 to derive a shift to lower mass to bring the high-@xmath17 values into agreement with the @xmath95 mex diagram ( see fig .",
    "14 of * ? ? ?",
    "this empirical correction ( shown as open grey circles in the right panel of figure [ fig : bpt ] ) shifts our data securely into the sf region of the diagram .",
    "these diagnostics demonstrate that there is likely not much agn contamination to the line emission in our sample .",
    "one of the largest sources of uncertainty in this analysis is our correction for [ nii ] in our measurement of @xmath3from the blended h@xmath15+[nii ] line .",
    "figure [ fig : avplot ] demonstrates how much our results change when we do not correct for [ nii ] .",
    "we use the relation between [ nii]/@xmath3and stellar mass by @xcite as a way of detangling the blended lines .",
    "we infer the [ nii ] contribution from the weighted average mass of each stack .",
    "because the two samples have similar masses and sfrs , and are close in redshift , the average sample properties should be fairly similar .",
    "still , the use of this relation may introduce bias into our results .",
    "however , our gas phase metallicities may be different from those of @xcite , due to slight differences in redshift , mass or ( s)sfr , which could affect both the slope and scaling of the [ nii]/@xmath3relation .",
    "such trends have been proposed by @xcite , in the form of the fundamental metallicity relation ( fmr ) .",
    "the fmr suggests that metallicity depends on both stellar mass and sfr .",
    "we repeat our analysis using the fmr in conjunction with the @xcite [ nii]/@xmath3metallicity calibration as an alternative way of calculating the [ nii ] correction .",
    "this allows us to test whether the trend of @xmath73versus ssfr may be due to a variation in [ nii]/@xmath3with sfr .",
    "if the fmr is adopted , the @xmath0values are slightly lower than the @xmath0values derived using the @xcite values , which reduces the strength of the trend of @xmath73 with ssfr . in this case , the relation we observe between @xmath73and ssfr is weaker than the trend presented in section [ sec : ssfrsfrmass ] , and is consistent with no trend , as the difference is only @xmath97 .",
    "however , the data are still suggestive of a possible decreasing trend of @xmath73with ssfr , which would imply the signal is not entirely caused by trends with metallicity .",
    "it is also possible that there is some agn contamination at the highest masses @xcite , which would also result in an underestimate of the [ nii ] fraction . in most cases ,",
    "our corrected @xmath3flux would be higher than the true value , leading to an overestimate of @xmath0 .",
    "we use the mass-[nii]/@xmath3relation presented in @xcite for our analysis over the fmr due to uncertainty about metallicity relations at high redshifts .",
    "first , the fmr is still not well tested at these redshifts @xcite .",
    "second , recent work has also questioned whether [ nii]/@xmath3correlates with metallicity at these redshifts @xcite .",
    "@xcite present direct measurements of [ nii]/@xmath3 , which allows us to avoid systematic problems with metallicity calibrations .",
    "one of the strengths of our analysis is that we draw a sample from a non - targeted grism survey , with sample cuts designed to avoid bias as much as possible .",
    "however , bias and incompleteness most likely still affect our sample .",
    "the dustiest star - forming galaxies have very attenuated @xmath3fluxes .",
    "our @xmath3snr selection cut , designed to avoid adding noise to our analysis , introduces bias against galaxies with large @xmath0 .",
    "this bias affects the high mass , high sfr end of the sample , as these objects have the largest @xmath35 . as lower mass ,",
    "lower sfr galaxies tend to have lower @xmath3luminosities , the @xmath3snr cut will also exclude objects with the largest @xmath35values in that mass range .",
    "our continuum normalization scheme also introduces bias into our analysis .",
    "we adopt a normalization scheme to improve the signal of our stack , but the cost is that some objects have much higher scaled @xmath3fluxes , and thus they dominate our stacks .",
    "this biases our results towards those objects with higher @xmath3equivalent widths in a given bin .",
    "because the line measurements are biased based on the @xmath3flux , we take the weighted average of the continuum values within a bin to ensure a fair comparison .",
    "however , if we instead used a non - weighted average for @xmath98 , the @xmath1vs .",
    "@xmath0relationship does not change much .",
    "in this paper , we investigate dust attenuation in @xmath23 star - forming galaxies using data from the 3d - hst survey .",
    "we measure both the dust towards hii regions , using balmer decrements , and the integrated dust properties , using sed modeling .",
    "we find that there is extra attenuation towards star - forming regions . on average the total attenuation of these regions , @xmath0 ,",
    "is 1.86 times the integrated dust attenuation , @xmath1 .",
    "however , the amount of extra attenuation is not the same for all galaxies .",
    "we find that the amount of extra attenuation decreases with increasing ssfr , in agreement with the results by @xcite for low - redshift galaxies .",
    "our findings are consistent with the two - component dust model , which assumes there is a diffuse dust component in the ism and a dust component associated with the short - lived stellar birth clouds . for galaxies with high ssfr , the stellar light will be dominated by continuum emission from the younger stellar population in the birth clouds , resulting in similar attenuation toward the line and continuum emission . for more evolved galaxies , much of the stellar light",
    "will only be attenuated by the diffuse ism , leading to larger discrepancies between the two dust measures .",
    "the observed trend of @xmath73with ssfr may be affected by uncertainties in the [ nii ] correction and possible dust attenuation law variations .",
    "future work is necessary to determine what role these effects have on the relation between @xmath73and ssfr .",
    "similar to previous studies @xcite , we find less extra attenuation in distant galaxies than is found in the local universe @xcite .",
    "this effect can also be explained by the two - component model , as lower redshift objects tend to have lower ssfrs than higher redshift galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we find that both @xmath0and @xmath1increase with increasing sfr and stellar mass , and decreasing specific sfrs .",
    "however , our data are biased against the dustiest objects , which may affect these trends .",
    "we also observe there to be little redshift evolution in the @xmath0-@xmath99 relation , although uncertainties and incompleteness makes it impossible to make a definite claim .",
    "using the balmer decrements , we calculate dust - corrected @xmath3sfrs to test the accuracy of sfrs derived from sed fitting .",
    "we find better agreement between the sfr indicators if short sfh decay times are not allowed and the constraint @xmath100 is used .",
    "this generally agrees with the results of past studies comparing uv+ir and sed sfrs @xcite or @xmath3and sed sfrs @xcite .",
    "however , even with this constraint the sed sfrs slightly underestimate the @xmath3sfrs .",
    "we note that our results are slightly impacted by incompleteness and systematic uncertainties .",
    "first , we employ snr cuts on @xmath3to ensure quality data , which likely results in incompleteness of the dustiest galaxies .",
    "second , to obtain significant @xmath16detections , we stack spectra , and thus our normalization scheme or incorrectly measured integrated properties could impact our measurements .",
    "most of these issues can be overcome with future observations by a number of new multi - object near infrared spectrographs on 8 - 10 m class telescopes , among which is mosfire on keck @xcite .",
    "these instruments have higher spectral resolutions , which will avoid blended lines .",
