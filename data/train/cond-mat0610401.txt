    "however , the accurate theoretical description of the physics of mott insulators poses challenging problems , and many questions remain unresolved . a particularly important class of open questions , crucial , for example to the physics of high temperature superconductivity,@xcite concerns the behavior at strong interactions as the carrier concentration is varied away from the commensurate values at which mott insulating behavior occurs .",
    "an important theoretical step forward was achieved with the development of  dynamical mean field theory\",@xcite which showed that if the momentum ( @xmath2 ) dependence of the electron self energy @xmath3 can be appropriately approximated , the computation of electronic properties may be reduced to the solution of a quantum impurity model , along with a self consistency condition . in ",

    "this approximation is strictly valid in the limit of inifinite coordination number , but captures many features of the behavior of finite dimensional compounds.@xcite    one of the early successes of the single - site dynamical mean field theory was an explication of the basic phase diagram of the mott transition in single band ( hubbard - like ) models.@xcite if magnetism may be neglected , the phase diagram in the space spanned by temperature ( @xmath5 ) , interaction strength ( @xmath6 ) and chemical potential ( @xmath7 ) takes the form shown in the upper panel of fig .",

    "the @xmath0 phase diagram is shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] .",
    "if the chemical potential is held at the value @xmath10 , then the model is metallic for interactions weaker than a critical value conventionally denoted @xmath11 and we expect properties varying smoothly with chemical potential . as @xmath12 from below ,",
    "the quasiparticle weight and compressibility vanish continuously , so that the metal - insulator transition at @xmath0 is second order . for @xmath13",
    "the model is insulating for carrier concentration @xmath14 per spin , and there is correspondingly a region of chemical potential ( bounded by the curve labeled @xmath15 ) , where the density is pinned at @xmath16 and no metallic solution exists .",
    "the second order character of the transition at @xmath11 strongly suggests that the critical chemical potential @xmath15 smoothly approaches @xmath17 as @xmath18 from above .",
    "however , the insulating phase at @xmath13 is characterized by a spectroscopic gap @xmath19 which does not vanish at @xmath20 and remains locally stable for a range of @xmath21 ( the lower limit of the region in which the insulating solution exists , is conventionally denoted by @xmath22 ) .",
    "the gap , presented as a chemical potential difference from the half filled value @xmath17 is shown as a dashed - dotted line in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] .",
    "the difference between the values of @xmath19 and @xmath15 implies that in this approximation , doping a mott insulator produces  in - gap \" states , and fisher , kotliar and moeller have presented more precise analytical arguments which support these ideas and show that doping generates in - gap states for all @xmath13.@xcite    however , moving beyond general arguments , very little is known with confidence about the specifics of the phase diagram .",
    "the essential difficulty has been the lack of numerical methods powerful enough to address the region of strong correlations , low temperature and low doping where the interesting physics occurs . in this paper",
    "we use a newly developed method @xcite to solve the problem .",
    "the method permits access to strong correlations and low temperatures , with an unprecedented accuracy which enables us to construct thermodynamic potential curves and establish the nature and location of the transition .",
    "our results are consistent with the following scenario : the point @xmath23 and @xmath24 is a quantum critical point at which the electronic compressibility ( proportional to @xmath25 ) vanishes linearly in @xmath26 . for @xmath13 and @xmath0 ,",
    "a second order metal - insulator transition occurs at an interaction dependent chemical potential @xmath27 , with an exponent @xmath28 close to @xmath29 . for @xmath13",

    "we shall take @xmath38    for this choice of density of states the chemical potential @xmath7 corresponding to the ( potentially mott insulating ) density of one electron per site is @xmath39 and the critical interaction strength for the zero temperature mott transition in the single - site dmft approximation is @xmath40.@xcite      the single - site dmft reduces the solution of the lattice problem to the solution of a quantum impurity problem defined by @xmath41 it is useful to define the hybridization function @xcite @xmath42 the @xmath43-electron green function @xmath44 and self energy @xmath45 .",
    "the hybridization function is fixed by the self consistency condition @xmath46    the challenging numerical task is computing @xmath47 . in order to do this",
    "we have recently developed a new solver,@xcite which is based on a diagrammatic expansion of the partition function in the impurity - bath hybridizations and the monte carlo sampling of certain collections of the resulting diagrams .",
    "the summation of diagrams into determinants eliminates the sign problem , even away from half - filling , and our approach , which expands around an exactly solved atomic limit , leads to lower perturbation orders at stronger interactions @xmath6 .",
    "the method thus allows unprecedented access to low temperatures and strong interactions@xcite and will be used here to study the doping - dependent mott transition . near the end points @xmath48 and @xmath49 the green function converges very rapidly , but more effort is needed to accurately determine the long - time behavior .",
    "we chose a resolution of 10000 points for the green function and a smoothing procedure ( averaging over 30 neighboring bins ) at intermediate @xmath50 to reduce the statistical errors in the region where such a high resolution is not necessary . with this resolution ,",
    "the systematic errors should be small and we therefore estimated the error bars on quantities such as densities and energies from their variation in successive iterations of the converged solution . where no error bars are given , the errors are smaller than the symbol size .    from the computed @xmath47",
    "we directly obtain the density per spin @xmath51 , while the  internal energy \" may be computed as @xmath52 here we have used a property of the semicircular density of states to obtain a compact expression for the kinetic energy term , while the expectation value of the interaction term is obtained from a direct measurement of the double occupancy @xmath53 .      as will be shown below",
    ", a characterization of the metal - insulator transition requires the construction of thermodynamic potentials and the extrapolation of our data to @xmath0 .",
    "the insulating state is characterized by a large gap ( which means that the energy at low temperature is exponentially close to the ground state value ) and an extensive spin entropy of @xmath54 per site , so the thermodynamic potential of the insulating state is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is computed from eq .  ( [ energy ] ) .",
    "the entropy of the metallic state is in general not easy to obtain .",
    "however we note that within single - site dynamical mean field theory the metallic phase is , at low temperatures , a fermi liquid characterized by a @xmath57 variation of physical quantities .",
    "in particular , at sufficiently low @xmath5 , the energy and thermodynamic potential of the metallic state are given respectively by @xmath58 where the specific heat coefficient @xmath59 is @xmath60 here @xmath61 is the chemical potential which , in the model with @xmath62 , produces the density corresponding to @xmath7 in the interacting model . in the last line we used the fact that for the dopings of interest the density of states may be approximated by its half - filled value and that the self energy derivative at low @xmath5 may be approximated by the value of the imaginary part of the self energy at the lowest matsubara frequency divided by @xmath63 .",

    "we have verified that for the dopings considered , we can reach low enough temperatures that the metallic entropy @xmath67 is much smaller than @xmath54 .",
    "finally , we note that the thermodynamic potential may alternatively be obtained from the density - chemical potential trace via the thermodynamic relation @xmath68 . choosing a reference chemical potential @xmath69 we have @xmath70    below",
