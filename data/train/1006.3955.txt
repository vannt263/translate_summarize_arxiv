    "the study of vortices in planar chern - simons ( cs ) models has been pioneered in refs .  @xcite . since then , a lot of investigations on chern - simons vortices have been done ; see , e.g. , dunne1,dunne2,sakai , schap . during the past years , however , theories with non - canonical kinetic term , named generalized of @xmath0-field models , have been intensively studied .",
    "generically , their applications have been found in strong interaction physics , with the skyrme @xcite and skyrme - like models @xcite , and also in cosmology with the so - called @xmath0-essence models @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 fields change the way the fields approach their vacuum values , allowing thereby , for instance , the existence of solitons which approach their vacuum values in a power - like instead of an exponential fashion and which therefore have a compact support @xcite .",
    "also , @xmath0-theories allow to avoid derrick s theorem @xcite increasing the chances to find soliton solutions in symmetry - breaking models . by this way",
    ", several @xmath0-topological defects were already studied by several authors babichev1,jin , sarangi , bmp , bglm , bazeia0,bazeia3,babichev2,babichev3 and the overall conclusion is that their properties can be quite different from the standard ones depending specifically of the choice made for the kinetic term .",
    "the non - linear effects in @xmath0-theories make the equations of motion more difficult to solve and therefore we will focus only on bps vortex solutions which minimize the energy .",
    "they can be found by minimizing the energy functional @xcite or equivalently by using the conservation law for the energy - momentum tensor combined with the boundary conditions that require finite energy for the vortex @xcite .",
    "this method combined with supersymmetry arguments allows for the first order formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , used to obtain bps global @xmath0 defects in one dimension and whose linear stability is proved analytically . in particular , when considering perturbative corrections to the canonical kinetic term , the authors found linearly stable solitons which , as expected , do not differ physically from the standard kinks , as they have the same energy , even though their width and energy densities are different .",
    "they also found kink solutions through a specific combination for the non - canonical kinetic term and the potential .",
    "finally , the method was used to obtain topological compactons @xcite , e.g. , solitons which approach the vacuum values at finite distance , confirming the results of ref .",
    "thus , an important conclusion of this work is that even being a first order formalism ,",
    "it is suitable for the study of nonlinearities in the kinetic term . more recently , supersymmetric extensions of @xmath0-field models has been introduced @xcite .",
    "the most important aim of the present work is to generalize to vortices the first order formalism developed in ref .",
    "we take a @xmath1 abelian chern - simons model with a non - canonical kinetic term for the complex scalar field .",
    "we apply the method of ref .",
    "@xcite to obtain the first order equations of motion , and then search for vortex solutions choosing the usual rotationally symmetric _ ansatz _ for the scalar and gauge fields .",
    "first , we check that all vortex solutions of the bogomolnyi equations , i.e. , bps vortices , are physical requiring that they minimize the action .",
    "we then study analytically the bps vortex equations and present a vortex solution for a specific choice for the non - canonical kinetic term .",
    "finally , we compare our results with the bps vortex solutions obtained in refs.@xcite .",
    "we use standard conventions , taking a @xmath1 spacetime with a plus minus signature for the minkowski metric @xmath2 and using bold style for the spatial components of 3-vectors .",
    "we take an extension of the vortex model suggested by refs.@xcite , which has the standard form @xmath3 where @xmath0 is a constant , @xmath4 is the complex higgs field and @xmath5 is its potential . also , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with @xmath8 being the electric charge . here",
    "we are using @xmath9 , and the electric and magnetic fields are given by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "we modify this model by changing the canonical kinetic term of the scalar field , as described by the new lagrangian density @xmath12 where @xmath13 is , in principle , an arbitrary function of the complex scalar field .",
    "note that the non - canonical term in the lagrangian density , in the limit @xmath14 , leads us back to the standard chern - simons model .",
    "it is convenient for the study of vortices to write all the variables in dimensionless units . for",
    "that we take @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a mass scale of the model . also , we take the two parameters @xmath0 and @xmath8 as : @xmath17 and the electric charge @xmath18 . in this case , we get @xmath19 and we can write @xmath20 , with @xmath21 being the lagrangian density to be used from now on .",

    "this means that the potential has to have spontaneous symmetry breaking , as usual .    the magnetic field , with magnitude @xmath50is parallel to the magnetic momentum , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and the angular momentum , @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "they all vanish near the origin and faraway from it .",

    "we also need to write the energy density , the spatial component of the current density , the magnetic and angular momenta which respectively are given by @xmath63    we note that the procedure used in this section , to get to the first order equations , started with the conditions @xmath64 .",
    "this is motivated by ref .",
    "@xcite , and it shows explicitly that the choice of the potential @xmath65 depends on the choice of @xmath66 .",

    "in this work we have studied the presence of vortices in a generalized chern - simons model .",
    "the idea is different from the recent work babichev1 , where the author has investigated vortices in the maxwell - higgs model , modified to accommodate generalized structure , with the kinetic term being changed to a function of it .",
    "this study was done with the numerical integration of the equations of motion , and the modification there introduced has induced another mass scale .    here , our objective was to generalize the chern - simons model in a way such that we could find first order differential equations . to do this",
    ", we have changed the kinetic term @xmath88 to @xmath89 .",
    "we suppose that this modification leads to an effective planar field theory somehow similar to the standard chern - simons model . despite the modification in the kinematic scalar field term",
    ", we could write a first order framework and find vortices which are qualitatively similar to the vortices of the standard chern - simons model .",
    "however , we could identify several properties of the bps vortices which are quantitatively different from the standard vortices , since the solutions can be thicker then the standard solutions .",
    "these differences are shown in all the figures , where we depict distinct features of the vortices in both the generalized and standard chern - simons models .",
    "when compared to the model investigated in @xcite , an important distinction which appears in our work is that the modification we have included does not introduce another mass scale in the system . to see this clearly ,",
    "let us write the potential in eq .",
    "( [ gpot ] ) in terms of dimensional quantities .",
    "it writes @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the symmetry breaking parameter of the model . in this case , the mass scale @xmath16 which we had to include at the end of sec .",
    "ii can be seen as @xmath92 , so we do not need an extra mass scale , which had to be included in @xcite .",
    "we are now examining how to obtain first order equations in a more general model , modifying the kinetic scalar field term but including both the maxwell and the chern - simons terms .",
    "also , we are studying the presence of vortices in a maxwell - higgs model with the k - field modification similar to the case investigated in @xcite .",
    "preliminary results indicate the presence of compact vortices , e.g. , of vortices with the scalar and gauge fields getting to their vacuum values at finite distances from the origin .    before ending the work ,",
    "let us study the bogomolnyi decomposition of the energy of the static solutions of the first order equations found above . to make the calculation explicit , we rewrite the energy density ( [ csed2 ] ) in the form @xmath93this result",
    "can be used to recover the standard case of the chern - simons model .",
    "we make @xmath94 to get to @xmath95with the standard potential @xmath96which leads to the first order equations obtained in sec .",
    "iii .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we take @xmath97 we get @xmath98where we used @xmath99 we point out that an integration of @xmath100 over all planar space can be identified with an integration of @xmath101 the same space .",
    "this integration process gives the magnetic flux @xmath102 which is topologically invariant . in this way",
    ", this result leads to the first order equations used above , so the corresponding solutions are in fact bps states , with the energy bound being @xmath103 where @xmath104 represents the flux of the magnetic field in the plane .",
    "we note that the energy bound in the generalized model is the same of the energy bound of the standard chern - simons model .",
