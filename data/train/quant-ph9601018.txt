    "in the course of history many ingenious mechanical , acoustic and optical devices have been invented for performing fourier transforms  @xcite ( including nature s own such as the human ear ) .",
    "most of them are now of merely historical interest since the arrival of the computer  based algorithm known as the fast fourier transform ( fft )  @xcite which efficiently computes the discrete fourier transform .",
    "the fft algorithm can also be phrased in terms of quantum dynamics , i.e. , in terms of unitary operations performed by a quantum computer on quantum registers .",
    "indeed , all known quantum algorithms employ the quantum version of fourier transforms , either explicitly or indirectly .",
    "it is used for the periodicity estimation in the shor algorithm  @xcite and its approximate version ( the hadamard transform ) is commonly used to prepare quantum registers in coherent superpositions of different values .    in this paper",
    "we analyse the performance of the quantum fourier transform ( qft ) in the presence of decoherence .",
    "in particular we show that as far as the periodicity estimation is concerned the approximate quantum fourier transform ( aqft ) can yield better results than the full fourier transform .",
    "in the following we use some terms which were originally adopted from the classical theory of information and computer science and became standard in the lore of quantum computation .",
    "more detailed descriptions can be found e.g.  in refs .",
    "@xcite and in some recent reviews  @xcite .    * a _ qubit _ is a two  state quantum system ; it has a chosen ` computational basis ' @xmath0 corresponding to the classical bit values @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "boolean operations which map sequences of 0 s and 1 s into another sequences of 0 s and 1 s are defined with respect to this computational basis . a collection of @xmath3 qubits",
    "is called a _ register _ of size @xmath3 .",
    "* information is stored in the registers in binary form .",
    "for example , number @xmath4 is represented by a register in state @xmath5 . in more compact notation : @xmath6 stands for the direct product @xmath7 which represents a quantum register prepared with the value @xmath8 . * a _ quantum logic gate _",
    "is an elementary quantum computing device which performs a fixed unitary operation on selected qubits in a fixed period of time . * a _ quantum network _ is a quantum computing device consisting of quantum logic gates whose computational steps are synchronised in time .",
    "the outputs of some of the gates are connected by wires to the inputs of others .",
    "the _ size _ of the network is its number of gates . *",
    "a _ quantum computer _ will be viewed here as a quantum network ( or a family of quantum networks ) .",
    "quantum computation is defined as a unitary evolution of the network which takes its initial state `` input '' into some final state `` output '' .",
    "our presentation starts with a brief mathematical introduction to the approximate discrete fourier transform which is followed by the description of its quantum implementation in terms of quantum networks .",
    "then we analyse how the performance of the qft in the periodicity estimation is affected by the approximations in the algorithms and by decoherence .",
    "we also comment on possible simplifications in practical implementations of quantum networks effecting the qft and aqft . the quantum algorithm for the fast fourier transform which we use in this paper",
    "was originally proposed by coppersmith and by deutsch ( independently )  @xcite .",
    "the discrete fourier transform is a unitary transformation of a @xmath9dimensional vector @xmath10 defined by : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are in general complex numbers .",
    "it can also be represented as a unitary matrix @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the @xmath9th root of unity . in the following",
    "we assume that @xmath9 is a power of @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17 for some @xmath3 ; this is a natural choice when binary coding is used .",
    "the approximate discrete fourier transform can be conveniently described when we write the product @xmath18 in the exponent on the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ def ] ) in the binary notation .",
    "writing @xmath19 we obtain @xmath20 because @xmath21 for @xmath22 , the terms @xmath23 do not contribute to the transform , and the term @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ def ] ) can be expressed as @xmath25 beginning from the right of this expression , the arguments in the exponentials become smaller and smaller . in the approximate fourier transform parameterised by an integer @xmath26 , the @xmath27 smallest terms are neglected . in all the remaining terms",
    "the arguments are then multiples of @xmath28 . the @xmath29th root of unity becomes the basic element of the approximate fourier transform as opposed to @xmath30th root of unity which used in the ordinary fourier transform .",
    "( the ordinary fourier transform is obtained for @xmath31 ; when @xmath32 we obtain the hadamard transform , for which all terms but the last one are dropped . )",
    "the quantum version of the discrete fourier transform is a unitary transformation which can be written in a chosen computational basis @xmath33 as @xmath34 more generally , @xmath35 effects the discrete fourier transform of the input amplitudes . if @xmath36 then the coefficients @xmath37 are the discrete fourier transforms of @xmath12 s .",
    "this definition can be trivially extended to cover the approximate quantum fourier transform ( aqft ) .",
    "we will analyse the approximations involved in the aqft in terms of computational networks .",
    "quantum networks for aqft can be constructed following the description of the fast fourier transform algorithm ( as described by knuth  @xcite ) .",
    "this efficient classical algorithm needs to be re  expressed in terms of unitary operations  @xcite .",
    "the construction requires only two basic unitary operations .",
    "the first operation is a one  bit transformation @xmath38 ( one  bit gate ) that acts on a qubit @xmath39 of the register and effects @xmath40 the diagram on the right provides a schematic representation of the gate acting on a qubit @xmath41 .",
    "the second operation is a two  bit gate @xmath42 that effects @xmath43 where @xmath44 depends on the qubits @xmath45 and @xmath46 on which the gate acts and equals @xmath47 .",
    "the transformation @xmath42 is an elementary two qubit operation which affects only states with a @xmath2 in both position @xmath45 and @xmath46 regardless the state of the remaining qubits .",
    "the qft on a register of size @xmath2 reduces to a single operation @xmath48 performed on a single qubit ( cf . equation ( [ qftdef ] ) for @xmath49 ) .",
    "the extension of the qft network to a register of any size @xmath3 follows a simple pattern of gates @xmath48 and @xmath50 which can be seen in fig .  [ dft ] .",
    "it shows the qft network operating on four qubits which can be written as the sequence of the following @xmath51 elementary operations ( read from left to right ) @xmath52 the bit values at the output should be read in the reversed order ( see fig .",
    "[ dft ] ) .",
    "the number of gates needed to complete the qft grows only as a quadratic function of the size of the register : for a transformation on a @xmath3 qubit register , we require @xmath3 operations @xmath48 and @xmath53 operations @xmath50 , in total @xmath54 elementary operations . thus the quantum qft can be performed efficiently .",
    "the aqft of degree @xmath26 is represented by a similar network in which the two ",
    "bit gates that act on qubits which are far apart ( in the register ) are neglected , i.e. , those operations @xmath42 for which the phase shift @xmath55 for some @xmath26 such that @xmath56 are dropped ( cf .",
    "eq.([aprx ] ) ) . in that case",
    ", we need @xmath3 operations @xmath48 , and @xmath57 operations @xmath50 , which is an improvement on the qft case since @xmath58 . in fig .",
    "[ aqft ] we show the @xmath59 aqft network counterpart to the qft network shown in fig .  [ dft ] .",
    "the matrix elements of the qft and the aqft differ by a multiplicative factors of the form @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "the execution time of the aqft grows as @xmath62 .",
    "the quantum fourier transform , like the ordinary fourier transform , is a powerful tool for uncovering periodicities .",
    "any periodicity in probability amplitudes describing a quantum state of a register in a computational basis can be estimated ( with some probability of success ) by performing the qft followed by a measurement of the register in the computational basis .",
    "the result is obtained by reading the qubits of the register in the reversed order .",
    "for example , an interesting periodic state which plays an important role in shor s quantum factoring algorithm can be written as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is an appropriate normalisation factor and @xmath65 it is the state of a quantum register of size @xmath3 in which the probability amplitudes @xmath12 occur with periodicity @xmath66 and offset @xmath67 .",
    "if this offset is unknown , a measurement performed in the computational basis can not reveal @xmath66 or any of its integer multiples directly .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fourier](a ) .",
    "however , if we perform the qft on the register first and subsequently measure its state we obtain number @xmath68 which , with probability greater than @xmath69 , is a multiple of @xmath70 regardless the offset @xmath67 ( cf .  appendix ) .",
    "the probability is not equal to unity , because the finite size of the register leads to a  broadening \" of the fourier  transformed data , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fourier](b ) .",
    "( this is because @xmath70 is not necessarily an integer , and the quantum register can have only integer values ; this is discussed in detail in the appendix ) .    for the aqft the corresponding probability , in the limit of large @xmath3 ,",
    "satisfies @xmath71 this result is derived in the appendix .",
    "the effect of the approximation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ approximate ] where we plot the modulus of the amplitude of the transformed state @xmath72 ( with @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) for the aqft of different orders @xmath26 .",
    "[ phases ] shows how the phase of the transformed state becomes corrupted when @xmath26 becomes smaller .",
    "if the quantum fourier transform forms a part of a randomised algorithm then the computation can be repeated several times in order to amplify the probability of the correct result . in such cases",
    "the performance of the aqft is only polynomially less efficient than that of the qft .",
    "for example , consider shor s quantum factoring algorithm and substitute the aqft for the qft . in order to obtain a correct factor with a prescribed probability of success",
    ", we have to repeat the computation several times .",
    "let @xmath46 and @xmath75 be the number of runs respectively with the qft and the aqft so that we obtain the same probability of getting at least one correct result , i.e. , @xmath76 here @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the corresponding probabilities of success in a single run .",
    "the ratio @xmath79 scales as @xmath80 for some @xmath81 ( the upper bound is found graphically ) .",
    "this shows that in the quantum factoring algorithm the aqft is not less efficient than the ordinary qft , i.e. , the ratio @xmath79 scales only polynomially with @xmath82 .",
    "moreover , we will show that in the presence of decoherence the aqft can perform better than the qft even in a single computational run !",
    "quantum computation requires a controlled , quantum  mechanically coherent evolution at the level of individual quantum systems such as atoms or photons .",
    "this imposes severe requirements on quantum computer hardware .",
    "if we are to harness the unique power of quantum computers , such systems will have to be manufactured with unprecedented tolerances and shielded from noise to an unprecedented degree .",
    "even a minute interaction with the environment will lead to a non  unitary evolution of the computer and its state will , in general , evolve into a mixed state described by a reduced density operator @xmath83 , which is obtained from the density operator @xmath84 of the total computer+environment system by taking a trace over all the quantum states of the environment : @xmath85 consider , for example , a quantum register of size @xmath3 which is prepared initially in some pure state and then left on its own .",
    "as time goes by , the qubits become entangled with the environment . both the diagonal and the off  diagonal elements of the density matrix @xmath83 ( expressed in a computational basis )",
    "are usually affected by this process ( cf .",
    "the rate of change of the diagonal and the off ",
    "diagonal elements depends on the type of coupling to the environment , however , there are realistic cases where the dissapearance of the off  diagonal elements , known as decoherence , takes place on much faster time scale . in this case a simple mathematical model of decoherence has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "it assumes that the environment effectively acts as a measuring apparatus , i.e. , a single qubit in state @xmath86 evolves together with the environment as @xmath87 where states @xmath88 are the states of the environment and @xmath89 are usually not orthogonal ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the elements of the density matrix evolve as @xmath91 states @xmath92 and @xmath93 become more and more orthogonal to each other whilst the coefficients @xmath94 remain unchanged . consequently the off  diagonal elements of @xmath83 disappear due to the @xmath95 factor and the diagonal elements are not affected .",
    "there is an alternative way of thinking about this process .",
    "the environment is regarded as a bosonic heat bath , which introduces phase fluctuations to the qubit states , i.e. , it induces random phase fluctuations in the coefficients @xmath96 and @xmath97 such that @xmath98 the direction and the magnitude of each phase fluctuation @xmath99 is chosen randomly following the gaussian distribution @xmath100d\\phi,\\ ] ] where the distribution width @xmath101 defines the strength of the coupling to the quantum states of the environment .",
    "the elements of the density matrix @xmath83 are then reconstructed as @xmath102 , where the average @xmath103 is taken over different realisations of the phase fluctuations within a given period of time ( cf .",
    "the diagonal elements do not depend on @xmath99 , whereas the off ",
    "diagonal term @xmath104 averages to zero for a sufficiently long period of time .",
    "the latter approach to decoherence is very convenient for numerical simulations and was chosen for the purpose of this paper .",
    "it is similar to the monte carlo wave function method used in quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "we have analysed decoherence in the aqft networks assuming that the environment introduces a random phase fluctuation in a qubit probability amplitudes each time the qubit is affected by gate @xmath50 . in our model",
    "we have not attached any decoherence effects to gate @xmath48 . in most of the suggested physical realisations",
    "the single qubit operations are quite fast , whereas the conditional logic needed in two  qubit operations is often much harder to produce , which makes these operations slower than the single qubit ones , and often much more susceptible to decoherence .",
    "for instance , in the ion trap model proposed by cirac and zoller  @xcite single qubit operations require only one laser pulse interacting with one atom , whereas in a two  qubit operation two subsequent laser pulses are needed , and the atoms involved must form an entangled state with a trap phonon mode between the pulses . in any case , introducing decoherence to gate @xmath48 operations and ` wires ' in the network would not affect our results much , only the time scale for decoherence would change .",
    "we have quantified the performance of the aqft by introducing the quality factor @xmath105 .",
    "it is simply the probability of obtaining an integer which is closest to any integer multiple of @xmath70 , when the state of the register is measured after the transformation . in the decoherence free environment",
    "analysed in sec .",
    "[ estimating ] we obtain @xmath106 for integer values of @xmath70 and for a randomly selected @xmath66 the quality factor @xmath105 is of the order @xmath69 for the qft and of the order of @xmath107 for the aqft of degree @xmath26 .    in fig .",
    "[ decoh1 ] we show how the quality factor @xmath105 behaves as a function of @xmath26 and @xmath101 ( which characterises the strength of the coupling to the environment ) . for @xmath108 the maximum of @xmath105 is obtained for @xmath58 .",
    "thus in the presence of decoherence one should use the aqft rather than the qft .",
    "this ` less is more ' result can be easily understood .",
    "the aqft means less gates in the network and because each @xmath50 gate introduces phase fluctuations the approximate network generates less decoherence as compared to the regular qft network . by decreasing @xmath26",
    "we effectively decrease the impact of decoherence . on the other hand decreasing @xmath26 implies approximations which reduces the quality factor .",
    "this trade - off between the two phenomena results in the maximum value @xmath105 for @xmath109 $ ] .",
    "it is worth pointing out that for @xmath110 ( no decoherence ) @xmath105 remains almost constant for those values of @xmath26 that satisfy the lower bound condition ( derived in the appendix ) @xmath111 and when @xmath108 the optimum @xmath26 is found near this lower bound . in fig .",
    "[ decoh2 ] we also show how @xmath105 decreases rapidly with @xmath3 in the qft network ( although there is not enough data in the figure to determine if it really decreases exponentially ) .    our simulations were performed for ensembles which consisted typically of a one to two thousands individual realisations .",
    "we have analysed the approximate quantum fourier transform in the presence of decoherence and found that the approximation does not to imply a worse performance . on the contrary , using the periodicity estimation as an example of a computational task , we have shown that for some algorithms the approximation may actually imply a better performance .",
    "needless to say , there is room for further simplifications of the quantum fourier transform which may lead to at least partial suppressing of unwelcome effects of decoherence . for example , if the qft is followed by a bit by bit measurement of the register then the conditional dynamics in the network can be converted to a sequence of conditional bit by bit measurements ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . here , we wanted to show that there are cases where quantum networks that are composed of imprecise components can guarantee a ` pretty good performance ' .",
    "this topic has also a more general context ; it has been shown that reliable classical networks can be assembled from unreliable components  @xcite .",
