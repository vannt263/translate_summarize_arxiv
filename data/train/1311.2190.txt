    "the  by now discipline  of evolution by natural selection @xcite , can be distilled to three principles : ( _ i _ ) inheritance with ( _ ii _ ) variation ( called mutations ) and ( _ iii _ ) natural selection .",
    "phenotypes are traditionally defined as organisms that display some traits .",
    "traits may be identified with color of skin , height , speed of running , length of a molecule of protein , volume of cells and so on .",
    "we use a restricted definition of phenotypes , namely an organism that displays some trait that is subject to natural selection . with abuse of the english language",
    ", we call these adaptive traits . for example , an adaptive trait of polar bears may be the thickness of hair in their fur , where length of hair is presumably inherited .",
    "now consider the speed of running of prey to be an adaptive trait .",
    "assume that different values of speed are inherited with some variation and is subject to natural selection .",
    "then the speed of running is an adaptive trait .",
    "three issues of interest emerge : firstly , a value of a trait is an attribute of an organism .",
    "secondly , some variation in these values is not `` recognized '' as such by natural selection . in our example of speed of running , selection influences survival of those prey that run at , say , @xmath0km / hr and those that run at @xmath1km / hr equally",
    "this may be so , even when these two different speeds are inherited .",
    "ergo , a value of an adaptive trait is in fact a set of values .",
    "and this set identifies a subpopulation made of organisms that belong to a single phenotype where the population is made of phenotypes that carry all values of the adaptive trait .",
    "we shall get to the third issue in a moment .    mathematical models of evolution may be cast via differential equations that are either deterministic or stochastic . starting with individual - based models is useful for one can construct such models based on first principles . in such models",
    ", particles may represent single organisms that may be classified as phenotypes  they exhibit particular values of adaptive traits .",
    "particles may also represent a subpopulation of a phenotypes ; namely a set of phenotypes that are lumped into a single subpopulation  of population of all phenotypes  based on the granularity of natural selection .",
    "granularity refers to the idea that in acting upon phenotypes , certain range of values of adaptive traits are indistinguishable by natural selection .",
    "this range defines a subpopulation of phenotypes which in fact represents the unit of natural selection .    in modeling evolution by natural selection ,",
    "one often wishes to switch from individual - based to pde - based approach .",
    "one then begins with an individual - based model , and assumes that the number of particles , @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "the change of approach  from individual - based to pde - based  requires justification .    in a nutshell ,",
    "one begins with a definition of some property that is represented by a particle . in our case ,",
    "such property consists of values of an adaptive trait . in the context of evolution by natural selection ,",
    "the dynamics of values of such property are represented by changes in the frequency of such values in a population .",
    "next , one passes from a space - discrete lagrangian version of the dynamics to space - continuous eulerian version . in",
    "passing , one is faced with two problems :    firstly , showing that the counting measure corresponding to the sequence defined by the @xmath4-particles system as @xmath5 converges to a continuous limit measure .",
    "this convergence must be with respect to average values of adaptive traits .",
    "under appropriate regularity conditions , it can be shown that this limit satisfies a pde - based problem .    secondly , proving that the limiting evolution pde , along with appropriate boundary conditions and initial data , is a well - posed problem . furthermore , that the solution to the problem inherits the essential properties  such as positiveness and boundedness  of the discrete measures ,    the first problem , namely that of showing the convergence to a continuous process , has been addressed by @xcite for the adaptive evolution of a single populations .",
    "similar mathematical problems have been addressed in spatial dynamics of population @xcite , the theory of chemotaxis and phototaxis @xcite , and flow in porous medium @xcite .",
    "the second problem relates to solution of a uniformly parabolic ed .",
    "two approaches were taken to derive these parabolic equations ",
    "one by @xcite and the other by @xcite .",
    "the former applies to a single ed , the latter to a system of ed .",
    "the approach employed by @xcite stems from the original work by @xcite .    when ed is considered as a system of parabolic ed , the resulting pde problem is no longer uniformly parabolic , and in fact has a peculiar structure .",
    "to understand the lack of uniform parabolicity of the system of pdes arising in a multipopulation model , let us recall the essential assumptions of the model : ( _ i _ ) selection affects the dynamics of coevolving populations through mortality  that changes the frequency of subpopulations of phenotypes ; and ( _ ii _ ) selection and birth are instantaneous events .",
    "consequently , selection and birth are independent events .",
    "it follows that mutations , as they should , are random and mutations in each coevolving population occur in a separate ( from other populations ) so - called adaptive space .    for example",
    ", populations of prey and predators may evolve each in an adaptive space made of a single dimension , say , speed of running .",
    "then , through selection , changes in the frequency of phenotypes on the trait value of prey will , in general , induce changes in the frequency of phenotypes along the trait values of predators and vice versa .",
    "therefore , population densities of prey and predators will be affected by the distribution of phenotypes along trait values of their own as well as by those of the other population .",
    "_ however _ , mutations in each population occur in the populations adaptive space . because mutations cause diffusion  along values of the adaptive trait ",
    "population densities depend on trait values of both populations but only diffuse with respect to one of them .    in other words",
    ", we are faced with a special case of anisotropic diffusion in which diffusion of each population remains positive in the directions of their own adaptive space and vanishes in the directions of the other s adaptive space .",
    "recall that the second problem we are faced with is showing that the limiting evolution pde , along with appropriate boundary conditions and initial data , is a well - posed problem .",
    "chipot and coworkers studied related issues in the framework of the theory of singular perturbation . @xcite proved existence of solutions for a general class of time - independent boundary value problems .",
    "they also proved existence and some additional properties of solutions for a particular case of a nonlocal evolution boundary value problem .",
    "the problems they studied addressed a single equation ; we address a system of equations .",
    "yet , we fundamentally rely on their work .",
    "the complexity of the dynamics of evolution implies that exact solutions to the problem in terms of elementary functions are not available .",
    "even analytical qualitative properties of solution are hard to obtain .",
    "thus , in section ( [ sec : discretization ] ) , we introduce a numerical discretization of the problem under the finite element method framework .",
    "then , we construct some numerical experiments to observe salient features of the system of ed that can not be observed otherwise .",
    "we also use the numerical experiments to draw conclusions about potential dynamics of evolution under such peculiar systems .",
    "see @xcite for related numerical approaches .",
    "consider a population in which individuals give birth and die at rates that are determined by values of an adaptive trait , @xmath6 , that they exhibit ( a so - called phenotype ) and by interactions with other phenotypes .",
    "the population is characterized at any time @xmath7 by the finite counting measure    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the dirac measure at @xmath6 .",
    "the measure @xmath10 describes the distribution of phenotypes over the trait space at time @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath11 is the total number of phenotypes alive at time @xmath7 , and @xmath12 denote the values of an adaptive trait  which we identify with individuals ( or particles ) .",
    "let @xmath13 be the initial number of individuals and define a normalized population process by @xmath14    it can be shown that if the initial condition @xmath15 converges to a finite deterministic measure with density @xmath16 as @xmath17 , then under suitable assumptions about the dynamics of the discrete process @xmath10see",
    "@xcite for details  the limit of @xmath18 converges in law to a deterministic measure with density @xmath19 satisfying the following integro - differential equation @xmath20 here , @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote interaction kernels affecting mortality and reproduction , respectively .",
    "functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 define the death and birth rate , respectively , of individuals with trait @xmath6 , whereas @xmath25 is the probability that an offspring produced by a phenotype with trait - value @xmath6 carries a value of the adaptive trait that had mutated . the function @xmath26 encapsulates the so - called mutation kernel .",
    "it reflects the fact that trait values of progeny , @xmath27 , differ from those of the progenitor with trait value @xmath6 ( this , in fact , is the definition of mutations ) .",
    "as noticed by @xcite , ( [ eq.champa ] ) is an extension of kimura s equation @xcite .",
    "when the values of mutations are small and are distributed systematically ( that is according to some probability density ) , the nonlocal equation ( [ eq.champa ] ) may be approximated by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the second moment of @xmath30 .",
    "observe that , because adaptive traits represent biological attributes , the set of their values , @xmath31 , must be bounded .",
    "so ( [ eq.pde ] ) is assumed to hold in @xmath32 , for some final time @xmath33 .",
    "phenotypes with trait - values outside the boundaries can not survive ; therefore , we prescribe homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath34 when the dynamics include two populations , the generalization of ( [ eq.pde ] ) leads to a system of partial differential equations for the densities phenotypes @xmath35 and @xmath36 with respect to their corresponding populations .",
    "it is here that some subtleties arise , and we introduce them next . but",
    "first , some notation .    the open and bounded trait space of each population ( @xmath37 ) is denoted by @xmath38 , with @xmath39 .",
    "an element of @xmath38 is denoted by @xmath40 and is given by its components @xmath41 .",
    "we then write @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we use the laplacian operator restricted to @xmath38 and write @xmath44 we now state the problem for two populations thus .    for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , find @xmath47 such that @xmath48 the magnitude and rate of mutations are defined thus : @xmath49 and the interactions within and among populations  including natural selection ",
    "thus @xmath50 equations ( [ eq : the problem ] ) to ( [ eq : f ] ) specify the problem , which we dub @xmath51 .    from a direct differential approach , the following model was derived in @xcite . for @xmath52 ( number of populations ) , find @xmath53 such that @xmath54 for some monotone functions @xmath55 , and with auxiliary data similar to ( [ eq.bc])-([eq.id ] ) .",
    "observe that for a suitable choice of @xmath56 , @xmath55 and @xmath57 , equation  ( [ eq : the problem ] ) may be recasted in the form ( [ eq : ed ] ) .",
    "the solution of ( [ eq : ed ] ) was dubbed evolutionary distribution @xcite .",
    "in this section we study the well - posedness of a variant of @xmath51 , which we christen @xmath58 , namely : @xmath59 for @xmath37 , where we have used the notation introduced in section [ sec.mathmodel ] .",
    "we rely on the following hypotheses about the data , which we shall refer to as * h * :    for @xmath37 ,    1 .",
    "@xmath60 is arbitrarily fixed , and @xmath39 is a bounded set with lipschitz continuous boundary @xmath61 .",
    "the diffusion coefficients , @xmath62 , are positive constants . 3 .",
    "the birth - selection terms @xmath63 satisfy : 1 .",
    "@xmath64 for all @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath66 is lipschitz continuous in bounded sets of @xmath67 for a.e .",
    "@xmath68 , with @xmath69 .",
    "the initial data are non - negative and satisfy @xmath70 , where @xmath71    we construct a solution of problem @xmath58 , namely @xmath72 , as a limit of a sequence of solutions of approximated singular perturbed problems , @xmath73 . in doing so , we face two main difficulties .",
    "firstly , the lack of uniform estimates for @xmath74 for @xmath46 , which prevent us from getting a global ( in space ) formulation of a weak solution of @xmath58 . as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "the regularity of @xmath75 can not be guaranteed and therefore , the trace of @xmath76 on the boundary @xmath77 is in general not well defined . for examples ,",
    "see @xcite , where a solution of a time - independent problem is shown to satisfy @xmath78 concomitant with @xmath79 .",
    "this difficulty also motivates the introduction of the space @xmath80 in ( [ def.space ] ) .",
    "thus , the notion of weak solution is stated in _ slices _ of the domain ( see theorem  [ th.existence ] ) .    secondly , and ,",
    "again , due to the lack of uniform estimates for the gradients in the whole domain @xmath81 , strong convergence of the sequence @xmath73 in @xmath82 can not be achieved by the usual compactness argument . yet",
    ", this type of convergence is needed to identify the limits of @xmath83 .",
    "thus , we resort to a monotonicity property implied by the lipschitz continuity ( h)@xmath84 which allows us to perform this identification .",
    "\\(i ) with minor modifications , theorem  [ th.existence ] may be proved for @xmath40-dependent diffusion coefficients @xmath62 under regularity assumptions and the conditions @xmath85 , for some positive constant @xmath86 , and @xmath87 in @xmath88 .",
    "indeed , the monotonicity of the elliptic operator in @xmath89 holds under these conditions : @xmath90    \\(ii ) although to prove our main result on existence of solutions we only need to consider a general lipschitz domain @xmath81 , in the context of our application this domain is in fact a regular polyhedra due to the choice of independent traits .    in the following theorem",
    "we assert the existence of solutions of problem ( [ eq.spde])-([eq.sid ] ) in a sense weaker than the usual .",
    "indeed , although the components of the solution are globally bounded in @xmath91 , the existence of their weak derivatives may be justified only in slices and so the notion of weak solution .",
    "[ th.existence ] assume * h*. then problem ( [ eq.spde])-([eq.sid ] ) has a weak solution @xmath72 satisfying , for @xmath37 , @xmath92 in @xmath91 , @xmath93 and , for all @xmath94 and a.e .",
    "@xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) @xmath97 with the initial data being satisfied in the sense that @xmath98 @xmath99    there is no general theory of existence of solutions for problem ( [ eq.spde])-([eq.sid ] ) .",
    "therefore , we introduce the following singular perturbation approximation to the problem .",
    "we follow an approach similar to that taken by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the dynamics of evolution provide unique challenges to its mathematical modeling through pde  which when applied to coevolving populations we call a system of ed  in that ( among others ) ( _ i _ ) diffusion terms in the resulting pdes are anisotropic and ( _ ii _ ) are determined , solely , by the functions that model growth of populations .",
    "anisotropy in a system of pdes refers to the property where the diffusion term in each pde is determined by said pde only .        numerical experiments with such algorithms behave as expected from the latter .",
    "we conduct factorial experiments that illustrate the effects of the perturbation parameter @xmath210 @xmath224 dirichlet and mixed boundary conditions .",
    "the dirichlet boundary conditions apply to models of ed .",
    "this is so because phenotypes that carry values of adaptive traits outside the boundaries of such traits can not survive or can not exist .",
    "for example  except for few exceptional cases  organisms whose body temperature is regulated can not survive if it is ( approximately ) below @xmath225c .",
    "neither can they survive for long when their body temperature is ( approximately ) above @xmath226c .",
    "the numerical experiments with two competing populations , each with its own adaptive trait , reveal the following : ( _ i _ ) the density of phenotypes mirror each other  this , in spite of the anisotropy ; such a pattern surfaces because the ed of the populations interact through the competition term .",
    "( _ ii _ ) near the boundaries , and as expected , the population that diffuses faster ( @xmath214 ) obtains density higher than the population that diffuses slower ( @xmath227 ) . for a single ed ,",
    "we @xcite obtained dynamics that correspond to the ed with @xmath214 ( see left and bottom panels in figure [ fig.exp1 ] ) regardless of the magnitude of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "this is so because in a system with a single ed there is no influence ( in terms of the diffusion ) of another ed that prevents it from achieving high density near the boundaries .",
    "the results from experiments @xmath230 to @xmath231 ( given in figures [ fig.exp3a ] - [ fig.exp3c ] ) illustrate the influence of the perturbation parameter @xmath210 with dirichlet boundary conditions compared to mix boundary conditions .",
    "the right panels of each of the figures reflect the ever increasing density at the boundaries ( compared to the center ) of the distribution .",
    "the trends in these results correspond to those with the dirichlet boundary conditions .",
