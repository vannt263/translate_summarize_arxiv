    "dynamical studies have established the existence of supermassive black holes ( bhs ) with masses @xmath8  @xmath9 in the centers of most , if not all , local galaxies with bulges ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; richstone 2004 ) .",
    "a significant challenge to any model of cosmological bh growth is the nature of seed bhs .",
    "observations of intermediate - mass bhs ( @xmath10  @xmath9 ) in the local universe would provide the most direct empirical constraints on such seeds .",
    "the @xmath11  relation ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al . 2000a ; tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) strongly indicates feedback in the coevolution of galaxies and bhs , but it is still an open question whether the relation is established at early or late times .",
    "if , as some models suggest ( e.g. , di  matteo et al . 2003 ) , the @xmath11  relation is established late in the evolution of a galaxy , then we may expect to see deviations from this relation in a population of intermediate - mass bhs that is not yet fully grown .",
    "there are other motivations to characterize the lowest end of the nuclear bh mass distribution .",
    "certainly their number and mass distribution will impact the expected integrated background in gravitational radiation ( e.g. , hughes 2002 ) .",
    "presumably they will pass through an active phase of accretion and contribute at some level to the observed integrated background radiation , particularly at x - ray energies .",
    "the range of accretion phenomena they display will depend on the major accretion modes for bhs of such low mass .",
    "the accretion states and , by extension , radiative growth mechanisms of this population will therefore have direct implications for the growth history of primordial bhs .",
    "apart from their physical implications , intermediate - mass bhs have practical value in that they offer tremendous leverage in anchoring local bh - galaxy scaling correlations such as the @xmath11  relation .",
    "recently discovered intermediate - mass bh candidates in galactic nuclei offer tantalizing hints as to the nature of this population .",
    "ngc 4395 is a very late - type ( sdm ) spiral with no bulge component , whose central stellar velocity dispersion is @xmath12@xmath13 km s@xmath14(filippenko & ho 2003 ) .",
    "nevertheless , it has the emission properties of a type 1 active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , with broad permitted optical and uv emission lines ( filippenko & sargent 1989 ; filippenko , ho , & sargent 1993 ) , a compact radio core ( ho & ulvestad 2001 ) with a nonthermal brightness temperature ( wrobel , fassnacht , & ho 2001 ) , and a pointlike , hard x - ray source ( ho et al .",
    "2001 ) that is highly variable ( moran et al . 1999 , 2004 ; shih , iwasawa , & fabian 2003 ) .",
    "mass estimates based on the h@xmath15  linewidth - luminosity - mass scaling relation and x - ray variability suggest a bh mass of @xmath16  @xmath17  ( filippenko & ho 2003 ) .",
    "interestingly , these agree with the limit of @xmath18  @xmath17  derived from the @xmath11  relation ( filippenko & ho 2003 ) .",
    "pox 52 , on the other hand , has a dwarf elliptical host .",
    "recently revisited by barth et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , pox 52 was first observed by kunth , sargent , & bothun ( 1987 ) , who noted the seyfert - like characteristics of its optical spectrum , including a broad component to the h@xmath15  emission line .",
    "the galaxy has a central velocity dispersion of 36  km s@xmath14 , which yields a mass estimate of @xmath19  @xmath17 , again consistent with the value of @xmath20 @xmath17  derived from the h@xmath15linewidth - luminosity - mass scaling relation .",
    "the [ ] @xmath35007 linewidth , @xmath21 km s@xmath14 , is also fully consistent with the stellar velocity dispersion ( barth et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is currently technically impossible to obtain direct mass measurements for @xmath22 @xmath17 , because of our inability to resolve the bh sphere of influence , for all but the nearest galaxies in the local group ( e.g. , m33 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "the only direct mass determinations for intermediate - mass bhs come from observations of massive star clusters ( gebhardt , rich , & ho 2002 ; gerssen et al .",
    "2002 ) , which , in any case , have been controversial ( baumgardt et al .",
    "2003a , b ) . barring evidence from spatially resolved kinematics ,",
    "the best indicator for nuclear bhs in nearby galaxies comes from agn activity as revealed through optical emission - line intensity ratios ( baldwin , phillips , & terlevich 1981 ; veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ; ho , filippenko , & sargent 1993 ) , kinematically distinct , broad emission lines ( e.g. , ho et al .",
    "1997c ) , or the presence of compact , nonstellar radio and x - ray cores ( e.g. , ho et al . 2001 ; nagar et al . 2002 ; terashima & wilson 2003 ; see ho 2004a for a review ) .",
    "thus , the best hope to find intermediate - mass bhs is through an agn survey . however , there are at least two practical challenges .",
    "first , it may be that objects like ngc 4395 are quite rare . in the palomar survey of @xmath23 nearby galaxies ,",
    "ngc 4395 is the only example of its kind found ( ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997a , b ) .",
    "pox 52 was discovered serendipitously in a fairly limited objective prism survey for emission - line objects ( kunth et al .",
    "these two are the only known cases of intermediate - mass bhs in galactic nuclei .",
    "thus , to accumulate a significant sample will require a much larger survey .",
    "second , even radiative signatures of accretion in these objects will be challenging to uncover .",
    "the host galaxies are expected to be either very late - type systems with low mass , and therefore intrinsically faint , or else regular , luminous disk - dominated galaxies with a tiny or nonexistent bulge . even at a high accretion rate",
    "a @xmath24  @xmath17  bh will itself have a low luminosity .",
    "as a result , detection of the faint agn will be limited by sensitivity and host galaxy contamination .    a large - area , sensitive , and uniform optical spectroscopic galaxy survey , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et  al .",
    "2000 ) , offers the best opportunity for finding a significant number of new intermediate - mass bh candidates .",
    "we present the first sample of candidates culled from the sdss .",
    "we discuss the data in  2 , the sample definition and analysis in  3 , and the main results in  4 . in this paper",
    "we assume the following cosmological parameters to derive distances : @xmath25  km s@xmath14  mpc@xmath14 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "since we have relied heavily on the sdss software pipeline , we will briefly discuss relevant characteristics of the survey .",
    "this is by no means a complete discussion .",
    "details of sdss photometry and spectroscopy can be found in the early data release paper ( stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ; hereafter edr ) and the data release one paper ( abazajian et al . 2003 ; hereafter dr1 ) .",
    "the sdss uses a dedicated 2.5  m telescope to image one - quarter of the sky and obtain follow - up spectroscopy on automatically selected star , galaxy , and quasar candidates .",
    "the dr1 includes a photometric sample of 53 million objects over 2099 deg@xmath28 and photometrically defined quasar , galaxy , and stellar spectra over 1360 deg@xmath28 ( abazajian et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "calibration and sample selection for both surveys is conducted by automated pipelines . the photometric pipeline , _ photo _ , performs bias subtraction , flat - fielding , cosmic ray rejection , and masking of bad pixels , followed by astrometry , point - spread function modeling , object identification , and image deblending .",
    "it measures four different ( asinh ) magnitudes ( lupton , gunn , & szalay 1999 ) .",
    "the petrosian magnitude , measured within a radius defined by the shape of the azimuthally averaged light profile of the galaxy , is best for photometry of extended objects such as galaxies ( stoughton et al .",
    "typical photometric calibration errors are 0.02 mag in @xmath4 ( smith et al .",
    "2002 ) , while the zeropoints between the sdss and ab magnitude system could differ by as much as @xmath29 ( stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "galaxy targets are automatically selected based on morphology . specifically , resolved sources with @xmath30 mag are targeted as galaxies ( note that this cut - off varied between the edr and the dr1 ) . candidates with magnitudes brighter than 15 in @xmath4 or @xmath31 or 14.5 in @xmath32 are rejected in case of contamination of other fibers .",
    "a surface brightness cut is also applied , and targets may be excluded due to proximity because the fiber holders have a finite size and are kept @xmath33 apart from each other to avoid fiber collisions .",
    "quasar candidates are selected on the basis of a color selection technique detailed in richards et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "sdss spectra are acquired with a pair of double , fiber - fed spectrographs .",
    "a plate of @xmath34 with 640 optical fibers is drilled for each field .",
    "each fiber subtends a diameter of @xmath35 , corresponding to @xmath36  kpc at @xmath37 .",
    "the spectra have an instrumental resolution of @xmath38 ( @xmath39 km s@xmath14 ) .",
    "integration times are determined for a minimum signal - to - noise ratio of 4 at @xmath40 mag .",
    "the spectroscopic pipeline performs basic calibration as above , as well as spectral extraction , sky subtraction , removal of atmospheric absorption bands , and wavelength and spectrophotometric calibration .",
    "redshifts are determined using @xmath41  fits to stellar , emission - line galaxy , and quasar templates , as well as to the emission lines themselves ; the typical accuracy is @xmath42  km s@xmath14 .",

    "( 2000 ) , whose robustness has been tested with respect to the @xmath11  relation of inactive galaxies ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000b ; ferrarese et al .",
    "2001 ; see barth 2004 for a review ) . in order to apply this method , we first identify all the agns from dr1 that have a broad component to at least the h@xmath46 emission line . in order to detect objects with weak lines and to reliably measure emission - line and continuum parameters ,",
    "we must properly remove the contaminating starlight from the host galaxy , model the profiles of the emission lines , and quantify the strength of the agn continuum luminosity .",
    "we discuss these various steps below .",
    "low - luminosity agns are challenging to detect because the signature emission lines are often contaminated by starlight .",
    "the sdss fibers always include significant host galaxy emission , making careful removal of the stellar continuum essential to reliably measure the emission - line spectrum , and especially to detect any weak , broad features . because we expect h@xmath46 to be the strongest permitted line in the optical , and",
    "hence best suited for detecting a broad - line component if present , we start with the @xmath47 galaxies and quasars in the dr1 with @xmath44 .",
    "the next step is to remove the starlight , along with any additional featureless nonstellar continuum emission , in order to produce a pure emission - line spectrum .",
    "a variety of template - fitting techniques exist to accomplish this ( see , e.g. , ho 2004a for a review ) . for this work we use a principal component analysis ( pca )",
    "algorithm adopted from hao & strauss ( 2004 ; see also connolly & szalay 1999 ) . assuming a linear relation between all spectral variations , pca ( or the karhunen - love transform ) transforms a large library of input spectra to an orthogonal basis in which each eigenspectrum is along a direction of maximal variance .",
    "the input spectra are derived from absorption - line spectra from the sdss , and an a - star spectrum may be included to account for a post - starburst stellar population . each program spectrum",
    "is then modeled as a linear combination of the eigenspectra .",
    "the pca technique has a number of benefits when a large , homogeneous database like sdss is available .",
    "the method typically requires no more than eight eigenspectra to fully reconstruct a given galaxy spectrum , and for absorption - line galaxies the resulting solution is unique .",
    "furthermore , the eigenvectors naturally include variance in velocity dispersion as long as the template galaxies span the same range as the target sample . in practice , some galaxies contain substantial nonstellar continuum emission , which we model as a power law fixed to a slope of @xmath48 , where @xmath49 .",
    "as discussed in j. e. greene & l. c. ho ( in preparation ) , the agn - dominated objects in our sample typically have a power - law continuum spectrum with this slope .",
    "examples of spectra before and after starlight and continuum subtraction are given in the left panels of figures 14 .",
    "once we obtained continuum - subtracted spectra , we used , as a first pass , a simple algorithm to cull objects with excess emission in the region 63006700   that is potentially broad h@xmath46emission .",
    "we began by removing any narrow emission lines from this spectral region by adaptively smoothing it , iteratively removing outlier points .",
    "we then calculated the mean , root mean square ( rms ) normalized to the dispersion in a line - free spectral region ( 5600 - 6000  ) , and integrated flux of the region .",
    "since the spectra are continuum - subtracted , any object with a nonzero mean , rms , or integrated flux is a candidate for having broad h@xmath46  emission . by trial and error we chose thresholds in the mean , integrated flux , and normalized rms that identified all broad - line objects down to a very low contrast .",
    "we conservatively chose a low threshold , which increased our contamination rate but enhanced our completeness . the resulting sample from this procedure comprised 4163 candidates .",
    "as an initial cut , this technique has the benefit of being computationally inexpensive ( important for an initial sample as large as the dr1 ) .",
    "it has two major disadvantages : potential incompleteness and high contamination .",
    "contaminants included misclassified late - type stars , which tend to have a broad maximum near 6500   that can be mistaken for broad h@xmath46  emission ( ho et al .",
    "1997c ) , and objects of unknown origin with large calibration errors or whose spectra have been corrupted in the h@xmath46  region .",
    "we experimented with using pipeline flags to automatically remove these , but in the end flagged them by hand .",
    "a more significant contaminant comes from incomplete removal of narrow emission lines from starburst galaxies with extremely strong line emission , or emission - line galaxies with multi - component , relatively broad narrow lines .",
    "detailed profile fitting , as described below , is required to isolate galaxies with a truly kinematically distinct broad - line component .",
    "the broad h@xmath46  feature , a reliable signature of agn activity ( see ho et al .",
    "1997c ) , is coincident with a combination of narrow h@xmath46emission and the flanking [ ] @xmath506548 , 6583 doublet .",
    "while in many cases the broad - line emission in our candidates is evident by eye , the h@xmath46 + [ ]  region is sufficiently complicated that some care is needed to determine the presence or absence of a broad h@xmath46  component .",
    "in addition to imperfect removal of starlight , the shape of the narrow lines themselves may confuse the detection of broad h@xmath46 .",
    "there are often broad , non - gaussian wings , multiple peaks , and asymmetries in the narrow lines that can mimic or hide a true broad component to h@xmath46 .",
    "we therefore use a profile - fitting procedure , similar to that of ho et al .",
    "( 1997c ) , to model the narrow components based on regions of the spectrum less prone to blending and confusion .",
    "we can then determine objectively whether a broad component is present .    while the profiles of the narrow emission lines in some agns are known to vary as a function of critical density and ionization parameter ( e.g. , pelat , alloin , & fosbury 1981 ; filippenko & halpern 1984 ; filippenko 1985 ; de  robertis & osterbrock 1986 ) , empirically the line profile of [ ] @xmath506716 , 6731 is generally well matched to those of [ ] and narrow h@xmath46  ( filippenko & sargent 1988 ; ho et al .",
    "therefore , we model the [ ] doublet with a superposition of gaussian components and then scale this model to fit the h@xmath46 + [ ]  narrow lines .",
    "we use up to four gaussian components when it is statistically justified .",
    "we do not ascribe any particular physical significance to the individual components , but they allow us to describe the line shape as fully as the data quality allows .",
    "the two [ ] lines are assumed to have the same profile and are fixed in separation by their laboratory wavelengths ; the relative strengths of the two lines change with density and so are allowed to vary in the fit . in a few cases where [ ] is undetectable or too weak to yield a reliable fit , we construct a model using [ ] @xmath51 .",
    "[ ] is both strong and nearly ubiquitous , and may seem like a better choice for template fitting . unlike [ ] , the [ ] profile does not typically match that of [ ] in detail .",
    "[ ] often has a broad , blue shoulder to its profile , suggestive of an outflow origin ( de  robertis & osterbrock 1984 , 1986 ; whittle 1985 ) .",
    "nonetheless , [ ] still seems to be an acceptable substitute for [ ] when the latter is unavailable .",
    "once a satisfactory narrow - line model is achieved it serves as a template for fitting the h@xmath46 + [ ]  complex .",
    "the centroids of each component are fixed relative to each other at their laboratory separations , and the relative strength of [ ] @xmath52 and [ ] @xmath53 is fixed at the theoretical value of 2.96 . an additional broad component for h@xmath46  is added if statistically warranted ; we use as many gaussians as needed , but generally no more than 23 , to fully describe the complex shapes of some of the broad components .",
    "our fits are shown as dotted lines in the right panels of figures 14 . from the final model for the broad h@xmath46  line ,",
    "we measure the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the profile and its integrated flux .",
    "this step eliminated a large number of broad h@xmath46  candidates , leaving a sample of @xmath543200 genuinely broad - line objects .",

    "since our sample selection required a relatively prominent agn component relative to the host galaxy , the sample should preferentially single out agns in a relatively `` high '' state .",
    "first classified as a group by osterbrock & pogge ( 1985 ) , nls1s are typically characterized by broad permitted lines with fwhm @xmath73 km s@xmath14 , prominent emission , and relatively weak [ ] @xmath504959 , 5007 lines . nls1s",
    "also tend to emit copiously in the soft x - ray band ( e.g. , boller , brandt , & fink 1996 ; but see williams , pogge , & mathur 2002 ) , presumably as a consequence of their high accretion rates ( pounds , done , & osborne 1995 ) .",
    "our sample conforms to some , but not all , of these expectations . by the linewidth criterion ,",
    "certainly all of the objects would technically qualify as `` narrow - line '' sources : the broad h@xmath46  component has fwhm ranging from 464 to 1730 km s@xmath14 , with an average value of 836 km s@xmath14 .",
    "however , we note that our sample shows a greater diversity of and [ ] strengths than in previous samples of nls1s .",

    "a major uncertainty in this exercise is that we do not have a robust estimate of the bolometric luminosity , but only a measurement of the optical luminosity ( @xmath57 ) . since the spectral energy distributions of agns are known to vary significantly with accretion rate ( pounds et al .",
    "1995 ; ho 1999 ) , it is doubtful that a single bolometric correction is always applicable .",

    "the morphology of the host galaxies of intermediate - mass bhs is of fundamental importance for understanding the origin of this class of objects and their relationship to the overall demography of central bhs in galaxies .",

    "the low end of the bh mass function , in particular , provides critical input to check theoretical models of quasar formation ( e.g. , haehnelt , natarajan , & rees 1998 ; bromley , somerville , & fabian 2004 ) , and it affects predictions of future gravitational wave experiments like _ lisa _  ( hughes 2002 ) .    a useful approach , first proposed by sotan ( 1982 ) , matches the local bh mass density inferred from velocity dispersion measurements with an accretion history inferred from observations of luminous quasars .",
    "yu & tremaine ( 2002 ) conclude that , for standard assumptions about radiative efficiency and quasar lifetimes , accretion during the luminous quasar phase can account for the majority of the local bh mass density . aside from the possibility of significant obscured accretion ( fabian 2004 ) , this method is limited by its use of the sdss velocity dispersion function , which at the moment is only well determined for early - type galaxies with @xmath111 km s@xmath14  ( sheth et al . 2003 ) , corresponding to @xmath112 @xmath17 .",
    "much of the current observational and theoretical effort on intermediate - mass bhs has focused on studies of star clusters ( gebhardt et al . 2002 ; gerssen et al . 2002 ) and so - called ultraluminous x - ray sources ( see van  der  marel 2004 ) .",
    "the existence of bhs in either class of objects is still far from proven , and , in any event , their relationship to galactic nuclei is unclear . with the recognition that galaxies like ngc 4395 and pox 52 do harbor central intermediate - mass bhs , the most straightforward way to make progress would be to find many more objects like them",
    "this study represents the first step in this direction . by sifting through the massive sdss database ,",
    "we have identified a sample of agns that we believe are promising candidates for hosting bhs with masses below the @xmath71 @xmath17  threshold .",
    "our sample opens up several new avenues for further study . while well - defined , our sample is likely to have missed intermediate - mass bh candidates such as ngc 4395 or pox 52 , whose spectrum is dominated by narrow emission lines , with the broad - line component visible only under very high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "moreover , if either agn were embedded in a much more luminous host galaxy , the weak broad lines would be even harder to discern .",
    "furthermore , we know that pure narrow - line ( type 2 ) agns do exist , either because the blr is obscured or intrinsically absent , and there is no reason to suppose that this situation does not persist to the regime of intermediate - mass bhs . a complimentary approach , then , is to use the width of the narrow emission lines to select potential candidates .",
    "while the detailed geometry and kinematics of the narrow - line region ( nlr ) in agns are complex and not well understood , it has been argued that its velocity field is largely dominated by the gravitational potential of the bulge of the host galaxy ( smith , heckman , & illingworth 1990 ; whittle 1992a , b ) .",
    "if so , then the velocities in the nlr are roughly virial , and on average the velocity dispersion of the line - emitting gas , @xmath113 , should be approximately equal to the velocity dispersion of the bulge stars , @xmath12 .",
    "the most detailed comparison between nlr and stellar kinematics for a large sample of seyfert galaxies has been done by nelson & whittle ( 1996 ) , who indeed find that in most cases @xmath114 @xmath12 , where @xmath113 was measured using [ ] @xmath115 .",
    "the exception are objects with powerful , jetlike radio structures where @xmath113 can be much larger than @xmath12 , presumably because of extra nongravitational motions induced by the radio outflows .",
    "thus , in general one expects that @xmath113 , as measured in [ ] @xmath115 or other optical forbidden lines , can be taken as a rough proxy , or perhaps more realistically as an upper limit , for @xmath12 .",
    "we are in the process of enlarging the current sample through a selection based on this strategy .",
    "another important next step is to obtain stellar velocity dispersions for these objects .",
    "such measurements will test whether the bh mass estimates we derive obey the @xmath11relation .",
    "conversely , if we assume that the @xmath11  relation is universally valid , the stellar velocity dispersion measurements will test the reliability of the virial mass estimator for agns .",
    "it would also be valuable to compare the velocity dispersions derived from stars with those derived from gas .",
    "another area requiring attention is to obtain high - resolution , deep imaging .",
    "much better data are needed to quantify the morphologies and detailed structural parameters of the host galaxies .",
    "do these objects have bulges , and if so , what kind and where do they fall on galaxy scaling relations like the fundamental plane ? finally , much work remains to be done , especially at non - optical wavelengths , to further characterize the properties of the agns themselves .",
