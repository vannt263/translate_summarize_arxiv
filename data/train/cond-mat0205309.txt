    "the dynamics of colloidal particles dispersed in viscoelastic polymer solutions are important in both fundamental and applied science . suspensions of particles in polymers are encountered in an vast range of chemical products including coatings , controlled - release drug formulations , personal care products , and filled polymer composites as well as being significant in many biological processes , such as intracellular transport inside the viscoelastic cytoplasm of a cell @xcite . from a fundamental viewpoint ,",
    "the characteristic lengths of polymers and colloids which differ by several orders of magnitude , suggest that these mixtures should be ideal candidates for coarse - grained descriptions .",
    "however while such approaches have been applied to equilibrium properties with considerable success there have been no comparable attempts , so far , to explain and quantify the rich dynamical and rheological properties of these complex mixtures .",
    "understanding the dynamics of these complex systems remains an important goal of soft matter science . in recent years",
    "considerable experimental progress in the characterization of these systems has been made though the development of optical microrheology techniques .",
    "the underlying idea , pioneered by mason and weitz @xcite , is that the brownian fluctuations of a colloidal probe particle reflect the viscoelasticity of the medium in which the probe is embedded . by analysing the thermal motion it is possible to obtain quantitative information about the rheological properties of the polymer matrix over an extended range of frequencies not accessible to conventional rheometers .",
    "optical microrheology experiments typically monitor the thermal fluctuations of a _ single _ probe particle using a combination of video microscopy , optical interferometry @xcite , or diffusing wave spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "while microrheological techniques enjoy significant potential advantages over traditional rheological methods complications in interpretation have limited their application @xcite .",
    "the problem is that the presence of a particle can perturb the surrounding medium ( by , for instance , depleting polymer segments from near the particle surface ) so that the dynamics of a single particle fails to reflect the macroscopic viscoelasticity of the medium @xcite . in effect , a particle diffuses in a `` pocket '' of material whose local rheological properties are not those of the bulk . to circumvent this limitation , crocker _",
    "@xcite conjectured that the correlated fluctuations of _ two _ separated probe particles should measure the bulk rheological properties of inhomogeneous materials more accurately than traditional one - particle experiments .",
    "using video microscopy they tracked the thermal diffusion of pairs of probe particles embedded in a viscoelastic solution of guar and confirmed that the extracted viscoelastic moduli were in close agreement with conventional measurements .",
    "significantly , the single particle results differed substantially , both in magnitude and scaling , from the two - particle results .",
    "recently these observations have been confirmed theoretically by levine and lubensky @xcite . using an analogy to classical electrostatics",
    "they have shown that while one - point techniques measure essentially a local rheology , two - point correlations determine the bulk rheology .",
    "interestingly , these observations suggest that combined one- and two - point measurements could be a powerful tool to probe the nature of the specific interactions between particle and medium .    in this paper",
    ", we present an extension of the two - point correlation technique to high frequencies using optical interferometry to track particles with high spatial and temporal resolution .",
    "our approach allows access to a much faster range of timescales than previous measurements @xcite , as we show later .",
    "in consequence we are able to measure the rheological properties in a frequency range from typically @xmath0 10@xmath1 to .",
    "accurate measurements of multi - point correlations are substantially more demanding than one - point measurements . to achieve adequate signal - to - noise levels we have been forced to use a more intense laser beam than usually employed in particle tracking experiments @xcite .",
    "we consider explicitly the effects of optical - gradient forces and assume that each particle is held within a fixed harmonic potential .",
    "the two - particle correlations measured therefore differ from those discussed by crocker _",
    "@xcite where diffusion occurs in the absence of a potential .",
    "we develop a generalised langevin theory to account for the correlated time - dependent fluctuations in terms of the viscoelasticity of the medium .",
    "our paper is organised as follows : in section  [ sec : theory ] , we present an analysis of our two - particle microrheology experiments , and discuss how two - particle correlations are related to the viscoelasticity of the medium ( sec .",
    "[ sec : rheology ] ) .",
    "next , in section  [ sec : materials ] we describe our experimental setup and numerical procedures .",
    "finally in section  [ sec : results ] we present measurements of one- and two - point fluctuations of two widely - spaced spheres immersed in a semi - dilute polymer solution which demonstrate the validity of our approach before we conclude in section  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "the fundamental concept underlying optical microrheology experiments is that the brownian motion of a rigid spherical tracer particle is determined by the viscoelasticity of the surrounding medium .",

    "the msd is related to the rheological properties of the medium though linear response theory . in general , the time - dependent frictional force @xmath6 on a sphere moving with a velocity @xmath7 through a viscoelastic medium may be written as @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the instantaneous friction coefficient .",
    "the convolution on the _ rhs _ of eq .",
    "[ eqn : linear ] reflects the viscoelastic nature of the suspending fluid .",
    "energy is stored as the brownian particle diffuses , generating a  memory \" of the particle s past motion . in consequence ,",
    "the frictional force experienced at a time @xmath5 depends on the particle velocity at all earlier times @xmath10 .",
    "this non - local time - dependence changes profoundly the brownian trajectory so that from a measurement of the msd the time - dependent friction coefficient @xmath9 can be determined .",
    "the utility of microrheological measurements depend on extracting information about the rheological properties of the medium from the time dependence of @xmath9 .",
    "the optical gradient forces on a high refractive - index particle within a tightly - focused laser beam are well approximated by a harmonic interaction .",
    "consequently , we model our experiments by analysing the dynamics of a pair of rigid brownian particles of radius @xmath11 , each held in a harmonic potential well , and separated by a distance @xmath12 within a linear viscoelastic medium .",
    "fluctuations in the positions of the two particles are correlated as a result of the hydrodynamic interactions which are transmitted through the viscoelastic matrix . the standard langevin description ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) for the brownian motion of a pair of neutrally - buoyant particles of mass @xmath13 is readily modified to include the effects of the viscoelasticity of the medium , @xmath14    here the subscripted indices label the two brownian spheres , @xmath15 is the harmonic force constant of the optical traps ( assumed identical ) , and @xmath16 denotes the random brownian forces acting on particle @xmath17 ( @xmath17 = 1,2 ) .",
    "the time - dependent frictional coefficients @xmath18 in eq .  [ eqn : langevin ] result from the generalisation of the viscoelastic  memory \" ( eq .  [ eqn : linear ] ) to the case of two interacting particles . the self term @xmath19 details the force acting on one sphere when the same sphere is moving ( and the second sphere is stationary ) while the cross friction coefficient @xmath20 describes the force generated on one sphere by the motion _ alone",
    "_ of the other sphere . since the random thermal and frictional forces both have the same microscopic origin they must satisfy in equilibrium at a temperature @xmath21 , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xmath22 = @xmath23 @xcite",
    "the coupled generalized langevin equation ( [ eqn : langevin ] ) is simplified by introducing collective and relative normal coordinates and using standard techniques to solve the resulting decoupled equations of motion . here",
    "we focus on the solution for the two - particle mean - squared displacement , namely @xmath24 where the displacements are normalised by the equipartition result , @xmath25 .",
    "the mutual two - particle mean - squared displacement @xmath26 for @xmath27 details the correlation between the thermal fluctuations of the two separated particles .",
    "the self term @xmath28 , is the msd of particle @xmath17 in the presence of a second particle .",
    "the exact solution for the two - particle displacement function is from eq .",

    "the complete solution ( [ eqn : d12 ] ) is still too complicated to use to analyse experimental data . in order to derive a simpler result",
    "we make two simplifying assumptions .",
    "we start by considering the importance of particle inertia .",
    "the mass @xmath13 of the particle determines the decay time @xmath35 of the particle velocity autocorrelation function . here",
    "@xmath36 is the high frequency viscosity of the medium .",
    "for frequencies small compared to @xmath37 the momentum of the brownian particle will have relaxed to zero and we may neglect particle inertia . in our experiments",
    ", @xmath38 is of order so neglecting particle inertia is an excellent approximation at frequencies of experimental interest ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "secondly , we consider only the situation where the two probe spheres are separated by a distance @xmath12 which is large in comparison to the sphere radius @xmath11 . in this limit ,",
    "batchelor @xcite has argued from general symmetry considerations that the hydrodynamic functions depend on the dimensionless sphere separation @xmath40 = @xmath41 as , @xmath42 where the coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 are constants for a given medium .",
    "this asymptotic solution reveals that provided the two spheres are far enough apart , the self friction @xmath45 is , to leading order , independent of the separation @xmath40 .",
    "the mutual friction coefficient @xmath46 by contrast depends sensitively on the pair separation varying as @xmath47 at large @xmath12 so that the ratio @xmath48 is a small parameter which shrinks with increasing separation as @xmath47 .",
    "consequently the exact expression for the two - particle displacements ( eq .  [ eqn : d12 ] ) may be simplified by expanding @xmath49 in powers of @xmath50 . at large @xmath40 , only the constant terms and the part which decays with distance as @xmath47 contribute to the displacement field .",
    "retaining these leading terms yields the desired simplified expression for the correlated sphere displacements . ignoring particle inertia , the one- and two - particle displacements",
    "may then be expressed as @xmath51 where @xmath27 .",
    "rearranging these equations gives expressions for the friction coefficients in terms of experimental quantities , namely @xmath52 measurements of the single - particle fluctuations yield the self friction @xmath53 , whereas the mutual friction coefficient is found from a knowledge of both single - particle and two - particle positional fluctuations .",
    "our analysis is valid for any viscoelastic media , we make no assumptions about the homogeneity of the medium . we assume only that : ( i ) the particle pair separation @xmath12 is large in comparison to the sphere radius @xmath11 , and ( ii ) particle inertia is unimportant .",
    "the relationship between the friction coefficient @xmath54 and the viscoelasticity of the medium is a challenging problem in fluid mechanics .",
    "some of the complications are illustrated in figure  [ fig : micro ] which shows schematically the microstructure of a colloid - polymer mixture .",
    "if the polymer is non - adsorbing then around each particle is a depletion zone of width @xmath55 where the polymer concentration is less than in the bulk .",
    "physically , we expect the motion of an individual sphere to depend on the _ local _ environment rather than the rheology of the bulk solution .",
    "so it seems reasonable to expect the depletion zone around a particle to speed up diffusion , in comparison to the case where the medium is homogeneous .",
    "while such specific interactions between probe and medium have not been considered , levine and lubensky @xcite have analysed in detail the simpler case of a viscoelastic continuum . over a wide range of frequencies",
    ", they predict that the single particle friction coefficient satisfies the generalised stokes - einstein relation , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the laplace shear modulus of the homogeneous medium .",
