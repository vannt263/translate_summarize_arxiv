    "we argue based on our results that when and unfolded or partially folded polypeptide enters this complex , a large part of the folding may occur in the neck - region before it reaches the cage .",
    "moreover , we hypothesize that the modulating diameter of this chaperon complex would naturally be helpful in modulating the rate of folding in a chemically non - specific way .    in summary ,",
    "our results are important in understanding nanoconfinement induced stability of apolar polymers , solubility of gases and may help design better systems for enhanced oil recovery . while our work has explored the planar hydrophobic confinement in details , the geometry and charge distribution of the confining surfaces may affect the hydrophobicity . furthermore , effect of solute size consideration is also a determining factor for hydrophobicity which we will explore in future work .",
