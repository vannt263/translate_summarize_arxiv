    "a liquid upon cooling undergoes first order phase transition and forms a crystal .",
    "however if the cooling rate is increased it can not crystallize and forms an amorphous glassy material @xcite .",
    "in addition to fast supercooling , there are other methods to favor glass formation over crystallization . in bulk metallic glass community",
    "the usual thumb rules are to at least have a two component mixture with negative enthalpy of mixing and a 12@xmath0 size ratio between the components @xcite .",
    "single component systems are known to crystallize in a fcc+hcp structure @xcite , thus multi - component systems are commonly used for making glasses .",
    "the negative enthalpy of mixing makes sure that the components remain in a mixed state and do not demix to form single component crystals , whereas the size ratio provides frustration in packing .",
    "although there is an array of experimental systems which form glasses , in computer simulation studies there is only a handful of systems known to be good glass former @xcite .",
    "note that most of the glass forming systems have global crystalline minima @xcite . thus depending on the barrier to crystallization it is just a matter of time for the systems to crystallize . with the increase in the available computational power some of the well known glass former like kob - anderson ( ka ) model and wahnstrom ( wa ) model",
    "are now found to crystallize @xcite .",
    "thus in order to design better glass formers we need to be able to estimate the glass forming ability ( gfa ) of these systems .    in order to quantify gfa ,",
    "first we need to understand the origin behind the stability against crystallization .",
    "this is an active field of research and different studies have attributed the gfa to different phenomena @xcite .",
    "the most popular among them is the theory of frustration first proposed by frank @xcite . according to him",
    ", the local liquid ordering is different from the crystalline order and this frustrates the system and decreases the rate of crystallization .",
    "it has also been argued that regions with locally favored structures ( lfs ) give rise to domains and are connected to the slow dynamics in the supercooled liquids @xcite .",
    "sometimes the lfs can also be related to the underlying crystalline structure @xcite . in some cases",
    "the lfs connected to crystal structure grows more than the one connected to the liquid structure @xcite .",
    "the locally favored structures can be different in different dimensions .",
    "there are lfs , like the icosahedral ordering , which can cause frustration in the euclidean space but tile the curved space @xcite .",
    "frustrations are not always structural but can also be energetic in nature @xcite .",
    "most binary equimolar mixtures form crystalline structures @xcite , where the crystal structure may vary according to the size ratio of the components .",
    "there are also some exceptions like the equimolar cuzr structure which is found to be a good glass former @xcite .",
    "however , when the composition of the mixtures are changed then it is usually found that close to the deep eutectic point many of them form glasses .",
    "one of the argument in favor of the deep eutectic point being a good glass forming zone is that the viscosity is highest at this point so kinetically it takes a longer time to form a crystal nucleus .",
    "however it has also been shown that the structural frustration between two different crystal structures can make this region a good glass former .",
    "this kind of phase diagram ( in temperature vs. composition space ) are often referred to as a v - shaped phase diagram where the bottom of the v is the glass forming region @xcite .    in a recent work by some of us",
    "we have shown that even though all the systems at equimolar mixture undergo crystallization , as the composition of the larger size particles increases , the zone which forms cscl crystal at equimolar composition does not crystallize any more @xcite .",
    "it is already known from the study of energetics that the global free energy minima of these systems are cscl+fcc crystals @xcite .",
    "the well known ka glass former is one of the systems present in this more generic cscl zone and it has shown strong resistance towards crystallization even after being inserted with a cscl seed in the liquid @xcite .",
    "so far only in one study it has been reported to crystallize but in a structure which is different from that of the global minima @xcite . in the earlier study",
    "we have shown that in the cscl+fcc crystal structure the bigger  a \" particles need to have two different populations where there is a large difference in the order parameter ( coordination number and bond orientational order parameter ) of these two populations . according to us ,",
    "this large difference in order parameter creates frustration .",
    "thus the stability against crystallization is attributed to the structural frustration between the cscl and the fcc crystal structure @xcite .    in this present work",
    "we study a similar series of binary systems by changing the composition and also the inter species interaction length .",
    "many of the binary systems studied here are good glass formers and have a global minima which is cscl+fcc structure . thus according to our earlier study the structural frustration for these systems are similar . however , these different systems although share the same structural frustration are expected to have different glass forming ability .",
    "the goal of this work is to get a relative estimate of the gfa of different systems and then explore the origin behind their differences .",
    "our study shows that the free energy cost for cscl crystallization increases with the composition of the smaller particles .",
    "the system with lowest free energy cost also shows a pre - crystalline demixing in the liquid phase near the liquid / crystal interface .",
    "the demixing takes place due to the structural frustration between the cscl and fcc structures .",
    "upto a certain composition , the composition dependence of the free energy cost to create a crystal nucleus can be related to the composition dependence of this demixing entropy .",
    "our study of energetics shows that although in the whole range of composition the global minima is cscl+fcc crystal the driving force of crystallization in a certain region is the cscl crystal and in another region is fcc crystal . in the former region",
    "the system tends to demix and form cscl+fcc crystal and demixing frustrates the crystallization process .",
    "however , in the latter region we show that demixing does not play a crucial role .",
    "it is primarily the slow dynamics near eutectic point and lfs around the smaller  b \" particles which frustrate the crystallization process .",
    "the simulation details are given in the next section . in section",
    "iii we present the definition and method for evaluating different quantities , in section iv we have the results and discussion , and section v ends with a brief summary .",
    "the atomistic models which are simulated are two component mixtures of classical particles ( larger `` a '' and smaller `` b '' type ) , where particles of type _",
    "i _ interact with those of type _ j _ with pair potential , @xmath1 , where r is the distance between the pair .",

    "earlier it has been shown to be a good approximation to the full overlap function .",
    "so , the self part of the overlap function can be written as , @xmath38    again , the @xmath39 function is approximated by a window function @xmath40 which defines the condition of `` overlap '' between two particle positions separated by a time interval t : @xmath41    the time dependent overlap function thus depends on the choice of the cut - off parameter @xmath42 , which we choose to be 0.3 .",
    "this parameter is chosen such that particle positions separated due to small amplitude vibrational motion are treated as the same , or that @xmath43 is comparable to the value of the msd in the plateau between the ballistic and diffusive regimes .",

    "the melting temperature is studied by calculating the temperature dependent growth / melting rate of the crystal and fitting them to a straight line .",

    "while our calculations focus on the pre - critical region of the free energy surfaces , we can compare the relative free energy cost to form a crystalline nucleus of certain size as the composition of the system is varied .",
    "we observe that the free energy cost to grow a nucleus from 15 to 35 for all the systems are quite high ( in the range of 10 - 20 @xmath73 ) , which explains why all these systems are good glass formers . a comparative study of the cost of free energy shows that @xmath44 has a lower cost to grow a cscl crystal compared to @xmath51 .",
    "this explains the slow growth of the cscl crystal in the latter system which is observed during the melting study .",
    "we also try to grow cscl crystal for @xmath46 , which we do not observe during our simulation time .",

    "we next analyze the origin behind the difference in the free energy cost to grow a cscl crystal in different systems . in a recent study of crystallization in @xmath78 mixture",
    "it is found that the barrier to crystallization for the mixed system is about @xmath79 higher than the pure system @xcite .",
    "the @xmath80 and the @xmath81 have a small difference in their sizes and form fcc crystal structure . thus unlike structural frustration between the cscl and fcc crystal present in the systems studied here @xcite there exists no structural frustration in the @xmath78 system .",
    "however due to higher @xmath82 interaction the crystal nucleus for the @xmath78 system has a higher concentration of the @xmath80 molecules compared to that in the bulk .",
    "this leads to demixing in the system and the authors concluded that this demixing leads to higher barrier . in a separate study",
    "it is shown that the phase that nucleates easily is the one which has composition closer to the liquid @xcite . in this present study",
    "we note that in the cscl crystallization process , except for the equimolar mixture the composition of the nucleus is different from that of the liquid .",
    "the difference increases as we go towards smaller @xmath83 values .",
    "thus it is obvious that the growth of cscl crystal leads to demixing in the system .",
    "however , we would like to investigate if signature of demixing is present in the liquid which surrounds the crystal .",
    "in a recent study it has been shown that the liquid in the crystal / liquid interface shows some compositional ordering @xcite . in a similar spirit",
    "we now look at the crystal / liquid interface and investigate if the demixing takes place in the pre - crystalline liquid .",
    "for this study we perform @xmath84 calculation in a rectangular box where @xmath85 .",
    "initially the system consists of 432 cscl crystal particles ( equal amount of  a \" and  b \" particles ) and 864 liquid particles .",
    "the 010 layer of the crystal faces the liquid where the last layer of the crystal on one side has  a \" particles and on the other side has  b \" particles .",
    "the box length in the @xmath86 and @xmath87 direction is @xmath88 .",
    "the box length in the @xmath89 direction is @xmath90 .",
    "period boundary condition is applied in all directions .",
    "since we want to study the interface property it is important to not have a rugged interface thus the study is performed above the melting temperature of the pure cscl crystal in the respective liquid ( @xmath91 ) by pinning the crystal particles .",
    "although performed above the melting temperature while equilibrating the @xmath44 system we find the growth of a layer of particle on both sides of the crystal . in the analysis we consider these two layers , which are not pinned , to be part of the crystal .",
    "thus for this system after equilibration there are 504 crystal particles and 792 liquid particles .",
    "the liquid particles span over more than @xmath92 distance which makes it possible to study both the interfacial and bulk properties of the liquid .",
    "for the @xmath51 system an extra layer of  a \" particles grow on the surface which has  b \" particles facing the liquid . due to",
    "the scarcity of  b \" particles no extra  b \" layer grows on the other side . in this analysis",
    "we consider the surface where the extra layer of  a \" particle has grown .",
    "we calculate the fraction of  b \" particles , @xmath93 , within each slab of width @xmath94 , as a function of distance from the interface . the first point ( z=0 ) in this plot",
    "is taken within the crystal which for the both the systems show same value of @xmath93 .",
    "interestingly we find that for the @xmath44 system the concentration of the  b \" particles are higher at the interface and it gradually reaches the bulk value around z=4 .",
    "however for @xmath51 system the concentration of the  b \" particles are same at the interface and at the bulk .",
    "thus we show that the liquid which has a lower free energy cost for crystal growth also undergoes a pre - crystalline demixing in the liquid phase .",
    "similar to the earlier study @xcite we find that the liquid / crystal interface properties differ for apparently similar systems with different glass forming ability .    thus we show that the process of crystallization requires demixing which takes place in the pre - crystalline liquid .",
    "we now analyze the role of demixing in the free energy barrier .",
    "note that the per particle mixing entropy in a liquid can be written as ,    @xmath95    where @xmath96 is the mole fraction of the components .",
    "to form cscl+fcc crystal the liquid needs to demix .",
    "we show here that the demixing takes place in a liquid state ( refer to fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "although the demixing process happens step wise here we calculate the total effect of demixing .",
    "thus we consider that to form a cscl+fcc crystal , part of the liquid needs to form a equimolar mixture and the other part should have pure  a \" particles .",
    "thus the per particle mixing entropy in the pre - crystalline partially demixed liquid should be , @xmath97    the difference between these two entropies , @xmath98 , is the mixing entropy at per particle level that a liquid will loose in the process of partial demixing .",
    "@xmath75 as a function of @xmath83 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] which shows a non - monotonic behaviour with a maximum around @xmath99 .",
    "note that this kind of non monotonic behaviour is obtained in the free energy barrier to crystallization for the @xmath78 mixture which as discussed earlier is attributed to the demixing process@xcite .",
    "thus our demixing entropy study can explain the increase in the free energy cost for cscl crystal growth with decrease in @xmath83 till it reaches a value of @xmath100 .",
    "however this study does not explain why in the @xmath46 system where cscl+fcc is the global minima the free energy cost for fcc crystllization is much lower than cost for the cscl crystallization , the latter being so high that an estimation of it is beyond the scope of the present study .      in order to understand the origin behind lower free energy cost for fcc crystallization we analyze the role of different crystal structures in crystallization by studying the energetics .",
    "in fig.[fig8]a we plot the energy per particle of the liquid , the mixed crystal , the fcc crystal and the cscl crystal for different compositions at 0.8 times the melting temperature of their respective mixed crystals ( given in fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "this is the melting temperature which has been obtained by step wise heating the mixed crystal .",
    "we find that the energy of the mixed crystal is always lower than the supercooled liquid , which implies that the liquid is in a metastable state .",
    "the energy of the cscl crystal is always lower than the liquid .",
    "however for higher @xmath83 values the energy of the fcc crystal is above the liquid and at lower @xmath83 values although it becomes less than the liquid it is always higher than the cscl value .",
    "this would imply that the cscl crystal always drives the crystallization process .",
    "however this does not explain why both in the melting study and the free energy barrier calculation at @xmath46 although we can not grow cscl crystal we can grow fcc crystals .",
    "our subsequent analysis will explain this discrepancy .",
    "next we make an estimation of energy of the mixed crystal , @xmath101 , at the per particle level , at different compositions by assuming that 2@xmath83 of the crystal forms cscl and the rest forms fcc .",
    "@xmath102    here @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the energy of the cscl and fcc crystal respectively , at per particle level calculated for each system at their respective @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath105 and @xmath106 are the estimated contribution from the respective cscl and fcc crystal part of the mixed crystal again presented at the per particle level .",
    "note that the values of @xmath105 and @xmath106 take into account the fraction of the system which is in different crystal form . in this calculation",
    "we of course make some mistake by neglecting the surface energy .",
    "however we find that the value of energy per particle of the mixed crystal thus calculated is not too different from the value of the actual crystal ( fig.[fig8]b ) .",
    "these are again calculated at the same temperatures as reported in fig.[fig8]a .",
    "we now break up the contribution of the two components , the contribution from cscl and that from fcc and plot them separately .",
    "once we do that we find that although at higher @xmath83 values the cscl formation drives the crystallization at lower @xmath83 values it is the fcc crystallization which drives the crystallization .",
    "although the energy per particle of the fcc crystal is still lower than that of the cscl , the larger fraction of the fcc crystal wins over . a cross over happens just above @xmath46 .",
    "this explains why the system at @xmath46 , whose global minima is the mixed crystal , shows higher tendency towards fcc formation .",
    "however , this does not explain why the the crystallization process when driven by fcc formation has a lower free energy cost than when driven by cscl formation . in order to understand this",
    ", we study the coordination number between the  b \" particles , @xmath107 in the @xmath46 system , before and after crystallization . since we can not crystallize the @xmath46 system we study the crystallization of the mka2 model ( referred earlier in the melting temperature study ) which according to dyre and coworkers is similar in structure as the ka model but with a lower viscosity @xcite . confirming their conclusion we find that the lfs of the mka2 model appears quite similar to the ka model however the dynamics is orders of magnitude faster .",
    "we now analyze the @xmath107 as obtained in the mka2 system when it is in liquid form at @xmath108 and when it forms distorted fcc crystal around @xmath109 .",
    "these are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] . for comparison",
    "we also plot the @xmath107 for the pure cscl+fcc crystal at @xmath108 .",
    "note that the probability distribution of @xmath107 in the cscl+fcc crystal should ideally have a peak at 6 but the peak is shifted to smaller value due to the presence of a large number of surface layer of  b \" particles .",
    "the study shows that to form distorted fcc crystal although there is an increase in the @xmath107 it is not as much as required for the cscl+fcc crystal .",
    "thus demixing in the distorted fcc is much weaker that cscl+fcc .",
    "analysis of the same kind for the @xmath110 system ( not shown here ) shows similar behaviour .",
    "thus on the right hand side of the crossover where cscl drives the crystallization there should be free energy barriers due to demixing .",
    "however on the left hand side the system can avoid or reduce the loss of mixing entropy by paying some energetic penalty to form distorted crystals .",
    "the lower energetic stability of the distorted fcc is evident from fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "we find that for @xmath46 the disordered fcc structure melts at a lower temperature compared to the mixed cscl+fcc structure .",
    "[ h ]     as obtained in the mka2 liquid at @xmath108 , the distorted fcc crystal formed by the mka2 liquid at @xmath109 and cscl+fcc crystal at @xmath108 .",
    "the cscl+fcc is formed at the same composition as the mka2 liquid .",
    "the demixing required by the cscl+fcc liquid is much higher than the distorted fcc . ]    in order to strengthen our argument that it is indeed the demixing that frustrates the cscl driven crystallization process and leads to high free energy cost , we present a study of a similar system . reported in a earlier study by some of us",
    "we have shown that for the nacl system ( @xmath111 ) the crystallization takes place not only at equimolar composition but also at smaller value of @xmath83 forming mixed nacl+fcc crystal @xcite . a similar energetic study of the @xmath111 system is shown in fig.[fig10]a .",
    "we find that energy of the nacl crystal is always lower than the fcc crystal ( fig.[fig9]a ) ) .",
    "a similar crossover is also obtained for this system where at higher @xmath83 values the crystallization is driven by nacl and at lower @xmath83 values it is driven by fcc ( fig . [ fig10]b ) .",
    "thus we should expect a similar crystallization problem in this system which appears not to be the case .",
    "although the nacl and cscl systems appear quite similar there are some basic differences .",
    "the cscl crystal is made up of two interpenetrating sc structures of  a \" and  b \" type of particles .",
    "thus in the cscl+fcc crystal the  a \" particles have two different population one which forms sc and the other which forms fcc structure . in an earlier work we had mentioned that this wide difference in the order parameter of the two population causes the frustration between the two structures@xcite .",
    "if we are away from the equimolar mixture the growth of a cscl will deplete the population of the  b \" particles in the neighbourhood which should promote the formation of fcc structure between the  a \" particles .",
    "however a unit cell of fcc is not compatible with the cscl structure thus to reduce the structural frustration the system sacrifices the mixing entropy and increase the concentration of the  b \" particles in the liquid near the cluster as seen in fig.[fig6 ] to form more cscl structures till finally it is devoid of any more `` b '' particles in the liquid .",
    "this is the reason we find  ab \" and  a \" rich zone separated in fig.[fig4]a .",
    "the nacl crystal on the other hand is compatible with a fcc crystal as both require the  a \" particles to form fcc structure with same lattice spacing .",
    "thus unlike cscl and fcc the nacl and fcc can grow in a seamless fashion and the system does not require any demixing which reduces the free energy barrier . a snapshot of the nacl+fcc structure is shown in fig.[fig11 ] which shows that there is no specific  a \" rich zone .    [ h ]    .",
    "the simulation is done at t=0.6 .",
    "the snapshot shows seamless formation of nacl and fcc structure with no demixing . ]",
    "the study of the energetics can also explain the glass forming ability of some systems which has been previously proposed by dyre and coworkers @xcite . in the above calculation",
    "if we decrease the interaction between the  ab \" particles then the contribution from the cscl in lowering the system energy will decrease and the crossover will happen at a higher @xmath83 value . thus the @xmath46 will show higher tendency of fcc crystallization as has been reported earlier @xcite . in the same system if we make the interaction between the  a \" particles repulsive then in a similar fashion the crossover will shift to lower @xmath83 values and this will imply that the @xmath46 system will still be driven by the cscl crystallization . since this will also require demixing thus the system will be a better glass former as reported earlier @xcite .",
    "we find that the loss of mixing entropy is maximum for @xmath46 . in the free energy study within the scope of our calculation",
    "we can not grow a cscl crystal and thus can not estimate the free energy cost to grow a cscl crystal in this system . which implies that free energy cost is high and w.r.t cscl formation the @xmath46 system is most frustrated and a better glass former .",
    "however in the free energy calculation and the study of energetics this system shows a tendency towards fcc crystallization .",
    "the fcc crystallization also has a free energy cost because although without clear demixing the system can crystallize in fcc structure the presence of the lfs centered around ",
    "b \" particles can frustrate this crystallization process . however the cost of free energy to form a fcc crystal in @xmath46 system is lower than the cost of free energy to form a cscl crystal in @xmath51 system .",
    "thus it is tempting to comment that the @xmath51 system is a better glass former .",
    "however the process of crystallization is not only dependent on the free energy barrier but also on the dynamics of the system .",
    "this is the reason the eutectic point is expected to be a better glass forming region and our study of dynamics shows that indeed the @xmath46 system is the slowest . for the study of the dynamics",
    "we calculate @xmath48 from overlap function at the respective 0.8@xmath77 .",
    "note these are the temperatures where the free energy calculations are done .",
    "we find that for the @xmath44 system @xmath112 at @xmath113 , for the @xmath51 system , @xmath114 at @xmath115 and for @xmath46 system @xmath116 at @xmath117 . thus according to the study of the dynamics",
    "the @xmath46 system is a better glass former .",
    "note that the mka2 model which undergoes crystallization differs from the ka model not in terms of the structure of the liquid but in terms of dynamics . the local structure around the smaller  b \" particles which actually frustrates the fcc crystallization is present even in the mka2 model .",
    "however the relaxation timescale of the mka2 model is orders of magnitude faster than the ka model .",
    "thus our study confirms that as stated earlier@xcite it is indeed the dynamics / viscosity of the system which makes ka model a good glass former .",
    "in this article we study the comparative glass forming ability of different binary systems . in an earlier study by some of us",
    "we have shown that binary systems which form cscl crystals in a equimolar mixture fails to crystallization if the mole fraction of the larger particles are increased @xcite .",
    "the well known ka model is one of the systems .",
    "thus the ka models stability against crystallization is more generic and is similar to systems which form equimolar cscl crystal .",
    "the global structure for these systems are a mixed form of cscl+fcc crystal @xcite . in the cscl+fcc crystal",
    "the bigger  a \" particles need to create two different population one which contributes towards the cscl formation and the other which contributes towards the fcc formation .",
    "the order parameters such a boo and coordination number of the  a \" particles are quite different in these two crystal form . thus the failure to crystallize has been attributed to the frustration between the cscl and fcc crystal structure .",
    "note that there is an array of systems which have similar frustration .",
    "however the glass forming ability of these systems although have not been calculated but is believed to be different .",
    "thus there should be more factors contributing to the glass forming ability .    in this article",
    "we perform a comparative study of binary glass forming liquids all having good glass forming ability and similar global minima .",
    "the study has been performed by changing the composition .",
    "we find that the free energy cost to grow a cscl nucleus increases as we move away from an equimolar mixture .",
    "the study of the liquid at the liquid / crystal interface shows that the system which has lowest free energy cost to form a nucleus also shows a demixing near the crystal surface .",
    "we believe that the structural frustration between the cscl and fcc structure makes this demixing a prerequisite for crystallization .",
    "our calculation of the partial demixing entropy in the liquid state shows a non monotonic dependence on composition .",
    "it shows a maxima for @xmath46 system . we could show a connection between the change in free energy cost to create a crystal nucleus and the change in demixing entropy as a function of composition .",
    "our study shows that although the @xmath46 system is strongly frustrated against cscl crystallization , it has tendency towards fcc growth .",
    "we can justify this tendency of fcc growth from the study of the energetics .",
    "we show that in the composition range studied here there are two regions , one which is driven by the cscl crystallization and the other at lower @xmath83 values is driven by fcc crystallization .",
    "it is primarily in the former region that the structural frustration between the cscl and fcc structure leads to the requirement of demixing which eventually increases the free energy barrier and provides stability against crystallization .",
    "this point has been confirmed by studying a nacl+fcc system which naturally undergoes crystallization at all compositions .",
    "the study of the energetics of this system also shows two similar region .",
    "however unlike the cscl+fcc system , in the region where crystallization is driven by nacl , due to the compatibility of the nacl and fcc structure no demixing has been observed and the crystal grows in a seamless fashion . in the second region driven by fcc crystallization we show that demixing is not a stringent criteria and the stability against crystallization comes from the frustration caused by the presence of the  b \" particles with well defined lfs and also the systems proximity to eutectic point where the dynamics is slow .",
    "thus although we study three very similar glass former , which ideally belong to the same class of system and differ only in composition , we find that they do not share the same origin of stability against crystallization .",
    "we should also comment that our search of crystal structures is not exhaustive and the system which we claim to be a better glass former can crystallize in a different crystal form like the @xmath118 structure is found to be a low energy state of a system belonging to the same class where @xmath119@xcite .",
    "this system also is known to show resistance towards crystallization .",
    "the cuzr liquid which has a low energy cscl like structure is also a good glass former @xcite .",
    "note that in these two systems the composition of the crystal is identical to that of the liquid .",
    "thus even above @xmath120 it is not always demixing which provides stability against crystallization .    53 ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ] ",
