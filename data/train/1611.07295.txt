    "<S> the simulation confirms that the dst takes place within the s - shape in the flow curve , which is consistent with the linear stability analysis of the theoretical model .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction . </S>",
    "<S> - _ shear thickening is a drastic rheological process in which the viscosity increases as the shear rate increases . </S>",
    "<S> the shear thickening fluid behaves as a liquid at rest or weakly stirred situation , but its resistance becomes large as if it is a solid above a critical shear rate . </S>",
    "<S> the shear thickening can be continuous or discontinuous depending on its situation . </S>",
    "<S> the former is the continuous shear thickening ( cst ) and the latter is the discontinuous shear thickening ( dst ) which can be observed in densely packed suspensions of cornstarch in water . </S>",
    "<S> there are many industrial applications of the dst such as a body armor and a traction control .    </S>",
    "<S> the dst attracts much attention from not only engineers but also physicists  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a recent review  @xcite suggests three important mechanisms for the shear thickening : the hydro - clustering , the order - disorder transition and the dilatancy effect from the boundary  @xcite as well as their combinations . </S>",
    "<S> however , they are neither necessary nor sufficient . indeed , the jammed dry frictional grains without including any interstitial liquid under a volume control protocol also exhibit a dst  @xcite , but it is obvious that there are no contributions of the three mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , these three mechanisms can not explain that frictionless dry jammed grains do not exhibit any dst but frictional grains do exhibit the dst . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our knowledge is limited to understand the dst .    </S>",
    "<S> the suspensions exhibiting dsts have some common features . </S>",
    "<S> one is that the onset of the dst is insensitive to the volume fraction , which is determined by the stresses . </S>",
    "<S> the second one is that the discontinuous jump can be only observed below the jamming point  @xcite . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> shear thickening is observed almost independent of the density below the jamming point when we apply bulk shear stress  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one of interesting findings is that the mutual frictions between grains play important roles in the dst  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> seto _ </S>",
    "<S> et al._@xcite have performed simulation for suspensions which have frictional contact force based on the stokesian dynamics to confirm the existence of the dst . </S>",
    "<S> there are some similar papers which also indicate important roles of frictional force between grains  @xcite . indeed , kawasaki _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ performed simulation for frictionless non - brownian suspensions without hydrodynamic interaction and found that it exhibits only a cst  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> there are some phenomenologies to understand the mechanism of the dst . </S>",
    "<S> wyart and cates  @xcite as well as nakanishi _ et al _  @xcite proposed phenomenologies for the dst by the introduction of an order parameter which exhibits a s - shape in a plane of stress - strain rate ( flow curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> although the most important question on the origin of the s - shape has not been answered by them , their models qualitatively reproduce experimental observations . </S>",
    "<S> later , grob _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ have examined the validity of the order parameter model for the dst of dry frictional granular particles  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one of key remaining problems for the dst is to clarify the physical origin of the s - shape in the flow curve .    </S>",
    "<S> there are few theoretical papers on the shear thickening . </S>",
    "<S> one of remarkable achievements is that by santos _ </S>",
    "<S> et al._@xcite in which they demonstrate the existence of a cst in moderately dense hard - core gases by using the revised enskog theory . </S>",
    "<S> we do not know any systematic theory to describe dsts , so far , as long as we know except for our previous paper for the bgk equation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the previous approach contains some crucial assumptions and is lack of quantitative test of its validity , though we demonstrate the existence of s - shape in the flow curve .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this letter is to extract the mechanism of the dst in terms of the boltzmann equation for an idealistic situation of dilute gases under the influence of the friction of the background fluid . </S>",

    "<S> one taking home message is that the dst can take place in dilute gases without mutual frictions between particles , though the hydrodynamic interaction in our model is ignored . </S>",
    "<S> this encourages experimentalists to try to find the dst in gases in a fluid . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding experiment might be possible in a sheared granular gases under vibration or sheared suspension in a very dilute solvent .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the essential points of the dst is that there are four time scales , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , and two independent temperatures , the environmental temperature @xmath15 and the kinetic temperature @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the second important points is that the coupling among the pressure , the normal stress difference and the shear stress leads to a cubic equation to exhibit the s - shape in the flow curve . </S>",
    "<S> one can stress that the above scenario is universal , though we have analyzed dilute gases under the friction of the background fluid .    </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to extend the present analysis to a moderately dense granular gases by using enskog equation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the extension of the analysis presented here will be important . </S>",
    "<S> it is notable that the shear thinning below the occurance of the dst for dense suspensions is important , because the dst should emphasize the contrast between the high shear state and the low shear state .    </S>",
    "<S> we can discuss the validity of eq .   and its consistency with the generalized green - kubo formula  @xcite , though the quantitative accuracy of our approach is obvious . </S>",
    "<S> this will be discussed in the proceeding paper .    </S>",
    "<S> our model does not include any friction between grains , though many papers stressed important roles of the friction in dst  @xcite . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> , our analysis does not give any answer for the mechanism of dst observed in typical experiments and simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the difficulty including the friction is to have the contributions from the coupled stress and the spin temperature in addition to the shear stress , the normal stress difference and the pressure . </S>",
    "<S> a recent paper tries to reproduce a hysteresis in the flow curve , which is one of the characteristics of the dst by choosing the shear stress , the temperature ( the pressure ) and the spin temperature  @xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated the existence of a s - shape flow curve which means the existence of the dst in fluid coupled with the drag between particles and the background fluid at @xmath15 within framework of inelastic boltzmann equation . </S>",
    "<S> this model exhibits the crossovers from newtonian viscosity to bagnoldian viscosity for @xmath74 and from newtonian to the viscosity proportional to @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> the even - driven langevin simulation for hard spheres reproduces the dst with hysteresis and perfectly agrees with the theoretical results without any fitting parameters . </S>",
