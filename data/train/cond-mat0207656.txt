    "canonical random  matrix theory ( rmt ) as introduced by wigner  @xcite considers ensembles of random matrices classified  @xcite by their symmetries . in the asymptotic limit of infinite matrix dimension ,",
    "@xmath0 , this theory makes a number of remarkable predictions . the average spectrum ( the spectral density ) has the shape of a semicircle , the spectral fluctuations are universal ( i.e. , are under very weak conditions independent of the weight function used to define the ensemble , are parameter  free , and dependent only on the symmetries of the ensemble ) , and the results are ergodic ( so that for most members of the ensemble the spectral average of any observable coincides with the ensemble average of that same observable ) . for a recent review of the field , we refer to reference  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , early applications of canonical rmt to nuclear spectra encountered objections or , at least , questions .",
    "this is because in rmt , the number of independent random variables ( i.e. , of uncorrelated matrix elements ) is of order @xmath1 .",
    "put differently , in rmt every state in hilbert space is connected to every other such state by a matrix element which does not vanish and is assumed to be an independent random variable . but with the success of the nuclear shell model , it had become clear that nuclei are governed by one and two  body interactions ( the mean field and the residual two  body interaction ) . in a representation of hilbert space spanned by slater determinants of single  particle wave functions ( solutions of the mean  field equations ) , the residual two ",
    "body interaction has non  vanishing matrix elements only between determinants which differ in the occupation numbers of not more than two single  particle states , and most matrix elements of the residual two ",
    "body interaction , therefore , vanish .",
    "even if one is prepared to accept a stochastic approach and considers the non  vanishing two  body matrix elements of the residual interaction as uncorrelated random variables , the ensuing stochastic model is very different from canonical rmt : the number of independent random variables is generically small compared to the dimension of a typical shell  model matrix .",
    "why  so the question  can canonical rmt then serve as a model for the description of fluctuation properties of nuclear spectra ?",
    "french and wong  @xcite and bohigas and flores  @xcite approached this question with the help of numerical simulations .",
    "these authors replaced the actual two  body matrix elements of the nuclear shell model by random variables ( this , in essence , defines the two  body random ensemble ( tbre ) ) and studied the resulting spectral fluctuation properties .",
    "they concluded that the fluctuation properties were consistent with predictions of canonical rmt .    because of the complexities of angular  momentum and spin coupling and the exclusion principle , the tbre is not amenable to analytical investigations .",
    "thus , the introduction of the @xmath2body embedded ensembles ( ege(@xmath2 ) ) by mon and french  @xcite might be considered an essential step towards an analytical understanding of the numerical results obtained by french and wong  @xcite and bohigas and flores  @xcite and , thereby , of the stochastic properties of nuclear spectra . since then",
    ", the question has gained much wider significance : canonical rmt has successfully been used  @xcite in such diverse many  body systems as atoms , molecules , and quantum dots .",
    "all of these systems share with nuclei the feature that they are known to be governed essentially by effective one and two  body forces .",
    "thus , the embedded ensembles may be viewed as the generic models for stochasticity in many  body systems .    the embedded ensembles dispose of all the complexities of the couplings of angular momentum and spin while retaining the symmetries imposed by the exclusion principle .",
    "one considers @xmath3 fermions in @xmath4 degenerate single  particle states interacting via a random @xmath2body interaction .",
    "the single  particle states carry no further quantum numbers like spin or angular momentum .",
    "in contrast to shell  model calculations ( where the single  particle states are usually not degenerate ) degeneracy is here assumed in order to focus attention on the results of a stochastic @xmath2body interaction .",
    "the interaction is not restricted to @xmath5 ( although this remains the physically most interesting case ) .",
    "this is done in order to obtain an understanding of the transition from the case @xmath5 to the case @xmath6 which , as it turns out , is equivalent to canonical rmt . just as in rmt",
    ", the embedded ensembles can be bestowed with unitary , orthogonal or symplectic symmetry , and one distinguishes accordingly egue(@xmath2 ) , egoe(@xmath2 ) , and egse(@xmath2 ) .",
    "as in canonical rmt , one is interested in universal properties .",
    "therefore , one considers the limit of infinite matrix dimension .",
    "this limit is attained by letting the number of single  particle states go to infinity , @xmath7 .",
    "ege(@xmath2 ) is , thus , a generic model for stochasticity in many  body systems governed by @xmath2body interactions . needless to say ,",
    "ege(@xmath2 ) can and has been generalized to the case of bosons .",
    "central questions in the theory of the embedded ensembles then are : ( i ) what is the shape of the spectral density ?",
    "( ii ) what are the spectral fluctuation properties ? ( iii ) are these properties universal ?",
    "( iv ) are the spectra ergodic ?    in this review , we present the status of the field in the light of these questions .",
    "we start with a definition of ege(@xmath2 ) .",
    "then , we order the material by the analytical or numerical technique which has been used , rather than by the properties of ege which have been addressed .",
    "we define the @xmath2body embedded ensembles for fermions and for bosons for the cases of unitary and of orthogonal symmetry . we do not consider symplectic symmetry throughout this paper .",
    "we consider a set of @xmath4 degenerate single  particle states labelled @xmath8 , with @xmath9 . the associated creation and annihilation operators",
    "are denoted by @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the case of fermions and @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the case of bosons .",
    "these operators obey the usual ( anti)commutation relations .",
    "then , @xmath14 or @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the vacuum state .    to define the @xmath2body interaction ,",
    "it is useful to introduce operators which create a normalized state with @xmath17 fermions or @xmath2 bosons from the vacuum . in the case of fermions ,",
    "these are written as ^_k , = ^_j_1,j_2,  ,j_k = _ s = 1^k a^_j_s , [ 1 ] where @xmath18 .",
    "the label @xmath2 defines the number of single  particle creation operators , while @xmath19 stands for the set of @xmath20 s .",
    "the corresponding annihilation operators are given by _",
    "k , = ( ^_k,)^  . [ 2 ] in the case of bosons , the @xmath2body operators have the form ^_k , = ^_j_1,j_2,  ,j_k = n _ _ s = 1^k b^_j_s , [ 5 ] where @xmath21 . here , @xmath22 is a normalization factor which guarantees that the state @xmath23 has norm unity . for every set of equal indices @xmath20 containing @xmath24 elements occurring in @xmath19 , @xmath22 contains the factor @xmath25 .",
    "the random @xmath2body interaction for fermions is given by v_k = _ v_k ; ^_k , _ k ,  .",
    "[ 3 ] the coefficients @xmath26 are random variables with a gaussian probability distribution , mean value zero , and a common second moment .",
    "the @xmath27 form an ensemble of random operators . in the case of unitary symmetry ,",
    "the @xmath26 are complex .",
    "the only non  vanishing second moment is = v^2 _  _   .",
    "[ 4 ] the bar denotes the ensemble average .",
    "the kronecker delta s stand for the string @xmath28 . in the case of orthogonal symmetry ,",
    "the @xmath26 are real and obey = v^2  [ _  _  + _  _  ]  .",
    "[ 6 ] following the usage in canonical rmt , we distinguish both cases by writing @xmath29 with @xmath30 for orthogonal and unitary symmetry , respectively . the @xmath2body random interaction for bosons is defined in complete analogy to equation  ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 sets the scale of the energy . as long as we consider only a single ege(@xmath2 )",
    ", we can put @xmath32 without loss of generality .",
    "we consider a hilbert space obtained by distributing @xmath33 fermions or @xmath3 bosons over the single  particle states @xmath34 .",
    "a complete set of basis states for fermions ( bosons ) is given by @xmath35 ( by @xmath36 , respectively ) .",
    "the dimensions of these two spaces are",
    "n = l m  for  fermions  , +   + n_b = l + m - 1 m  for  bosons  . [ 7 ] here and in the sequel , we use the index @xmath37 for bosons while we typically work without such an index for the more frequent case of fermions .",
    "we take @xmath38 and consider the matrix of the @xmath2body interaction @xmath27 in that @xmath3particle hilbert space .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath39 have the form |",
    "v_k | = 0    equation  ( [ 3 ] ) for @xmath27 , it is easily seen that for @xmath40 , the matrices of the @xmath2body interaction @xmath27 coincide with the gue or the goe , depending on the symmetry chosen , both for fermions and for bosons .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath41 . in this case",
    ", we speak of the @xmath2body embedded gaussian ensembles ( ege(@xmath2 ) ) of random matrices in the @xmath3particle hilbert space .",
    "we use the notation egue(@xmath2 ) and egoe(@xmath2 ) for the cases of unitary and orthogonal symmetry , respectively .",
    "aside from the ( unitary or orthogonal ) symmetry , the embedded ensembles are defined in terms of the three parameters @xmath42 .",
    "we recall that in canonical rmt , the limit @xmath43 of infinite matrix dimension yields universal results . for the ege(@xmath2 ) , we proceed likewise by taking the limit @xmath44 which implies the limit of infinite matrix dimension . for fermions",
    ", we have the obvious constraint that @xmath45 . the limit @xmath44 with fixed @xmath2",
    "can be attained by keeping @xmath3 fixed , or by keeping the ratio @xmath46 fixed .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite define the dilute limit by taking @xmath47 . for bosons ,",
    "@xmath3 may be larger than @xmath4 . since ege(@xmath2 ) is constructed in such a way that ege(@xmath3 ) coincides with canonical rmt for both fermions and bosons , and since in the dilute limit the distinction between fermions and bosons becomes irrelevant , we expect that the spectral properties of ege(@xmath2 ) do not differ qualitatively for fermions and bosons except for the case where the number of @xmath3 bosons is close to or exceeds @xmath4 , the dimension of the underlying single  particle space .",
    "this is indeed what is found .",
    "canonical rmt is invariant under unitary or orthogonal transformations of hilbert space . while this statement carries over trivially to the @xmath2body ensembles embedded into a hilbert space spanned by @xmath2 particles , that invariance is lost for @xmath41 .",
    "the calculation of spectral properties of canonical rmt greatly benefits from such an invariance property .",
    "thus , the determination of the spectral properties of the embedded ensembles is much more difficult than for canonical rmt .",
    "the first analytical approach to ege(@xmath2 ) , developed by mon and french  @xcite , calculates moments of the matrix elements of @xmath27 and related quantities . it has led to insights into the shape of the ege(@xmath2 )",
    "spectra ( the spectral density ) , has led to the development of statistical spectroscopy in nuclei , and has given a limited answer to the question of ergodicity .",
    "these topics are reviewed in references  @xcite .",
    "the approach has mainly been used for fermions in the context of the nuclear shell model , although it can also be applied for bosons as in the interacting boson model for nuclei .",
    "we confine ourselves to fermions .    in a hilbert space with @xmath3 fermions , the @xmath48 moment of @xmath27",
    "is defined as @xmath49 } $ ] .",
    "it is obvious that all odd moments vanish .",
    "the even moments can be evaluated using wick contraction of the @xmath27 s .",
    "the moment is then the sum over all patterns of pairwise contractions . assigning the same letter to pairs of wick ",
    "contracted @xmath27 s , the fourth moment is , for instance , given by @xmath50 where we have used the cyclic invariance of the trace .",
    "for @xmath44 , the low moments can be worked out using combinatorial arguments  @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the moments yields information on the average spectral density @xmath51 .",
    "this is because of the relation = = e   e^p  , [ 8 ] where the @xmath52 are the eigenvalues of @xmath27 .",
    "canonical rmt is obtained for @xmath6 and predicts the spectral density to have semicircular shape . on the other hand , in the dilute limit ,",
    "all wick  contracted pairs of @xmath27 become independent of each other , the moment @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 , and the spectral density is gaussian .",
    "this shows that for fixed @xmath2 and for @xmath3 monotonically increasing from @xmath40 , the spectral density undergoes a transition from the semicircular to the gaussian shape . for @xmath55",
    ", the transition can be worked out easily because the level density for @xmath56 is the convolution of @xmath3 semicircles . already for @xmath57 ,",
    "the spectral shape is very close to gaussian .",
    "this argument fails for @xmath58 . in reference",
    "@xcite , the even moments @xmath53 are worked out for @xmath59 .",
    "the values obtained are consistent with the gradual transition from semicircular to gaussian shape of the spectral density .    in nuclear theory , sums over all final states of the strength of some transition operator @xmath60 play an important role .",
    "examples are single ",
    "particle transfer strengths or the gamow  teller transition strength .",
    "such transition strength sums can be worked out , too , using the moments method .",
    "the reason is that @xmath61 can be expressed in terms of creation and annihilation operators , and terms like @xmath62 $ ] can again be calculated using combinatorial arguments , especially in the dilute limit .",
    "this method has been very successfully applied in the framework of the nuclear shell model . in many cases , egoe(@xmath2 ) results obtained in this way",
    "show remarkable agreement with results of detailed shell  model calculations .",
    "we do not dwell on this important issue because an extensive review has appeared quite recently  @xcite .    using the moments method to calculate the spectral density or transition strength sums",
    ", we always use the ensemble average .",
    "is it justified to compare such averages with properties of a given physical system ( as we do when comparing with shell  model calculations ) ? while a given physical system obviously does not permit averaging over the ( physically non  existent and fictitious ) ensemble , it does permit the determination of spectral averages .",
    "for instance , by grouping neighbouring levels into bins , we can determine the mean spectral density .",
    "this poses the question : are spectral averages ( taken over a specific system ) and ensemble averages ( over the ege(@xmath2 ) ) identical ?",
    "this problem is referred to as the problem of ergodicity , in analogy to the well  known ergodic problem in classical statistical mechanics concerning the equality of phase  space average and the long  time average over a single trajectory .    for ensemble averaging to be relevant for an individual system ,",
    "the property under study must vary little from member to member of the ensemble . in the context of the moments method",
    ", the question of ergodicity is answered by calculating the variances ^(2)_p , q(m ) = - . [ 9 ] for canonical random  matrix theory and in a normalization where the individual moments are finite in the limit @xmath43 , the variances @xmath63 vanish asymptotically : the canonical ensembles are ergodic as far as the spectral density is concerned . for the embedded ensembles , the calculation of the variances in equation  ( [ 9 ] ) involves contractions between pairs of operators located in different traces as well as in the same trace .",
    "the treatment of the first kind of pairs requires combinatorial techniques beyond the ones developed for the moments  @xcite .",
    "mon and french could show that for egoe(@xmath2 ) , @xmath64 vanishes asymptotically for @xmath44 .",
    "thus , they could demonstrate ergodicity for the spectral density . their argument",
    "can easily be extended to egue(@xmath2 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the moments method , while very useful for the spectral density and for statistical spectroscopy , is only of limited use for calculating spectral fluctuations . for canonical rmt , mon and french consider density fluctuations as excitations of the semicircle and use this approach to study spectral goe fluctuations .",
    "they succeed in re  deriving the logarithmic dependence of the spectral stiffness on the length of the energy interval .",
    "however , the method apparently does not permit the study of short  scale fluctuations like the nearest  neighbour spacing distribution .",
    "mon and french apply the same method to egoe(@xmath2 ) with @xmath65 .",
    "they show that long  range fluctuations of the spectrum are large . as a consequence , neither the position of a given ( numbered ) eigenvalue nor the position of the centre of the spectrum or the variance are ergodic .",
    "we return to this point in section  [ eig ] .",
    "the short  range fluctuations , however , which yield information about spectral statistics , pose difficulties . to quote from reference  @xcite : `` ... there is no real theory yet for egoe fluctuations , the gap being one of the most significant ones in the entire subject . ''",
    "insight into the spectral fluctuation properties of the embedded ensembles may be gained from numerical simulations .",
    "such simulations have been performed from the early days of the field . here",
    "we review separately the simulations for fermionic and for bosonic systems .",
    "prior to the introduction of ege(@xmath2 ) by mon and french  @xcite , numerical simulations used the two  body random ensemble ( tbre ) .",
    "this ensemble was introduced in the context of nuclear physics where standard shell ",
    "model techniques were available to calculate spectra of given spin and parity ( and isospin if relevant ) in terms of a fixed two ",
    "body interaction .",
    "the latter was replaced by an ensemble of two  body matrix elements with a gaussian distribution , zero mean value , and a common second moment .",
    "the antisymmetrized ( fermionic ) random two ",
    "body matrix elements thus define the residual interaction among @xmath3 particles distributed over @xmath4 degenerate single  particle states .",
    "inasmuch as nuclei are governed by one and two  body forces , the tbre is clearly a more suitable stochastic model than canonical rmt .",
    "the complexities arising from the angular  momentum and spin couplings , from correlations between many ",
    "body matrix elements induced by the two  body character of the interaction , and from pauli s exclusion principle made it impossible to treat the tbre analytically . this led french and wong  @xcite and bohigas and flores  @xcite to resort to numerical simulations using matrices of rather small dimensions ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the main question addressed in these simulations was : are the spectral fluctuation properties of the tbre the same as those of the goe ?",
    "the main results of these early works are : ( i )  the spectral density of the tbre is gaussian , in agreement with the results of shell  model calculations with realistic interactions .",
    "( ii )  the spectral density displays a transition from gaussian to semicircular shape as the rank of the interaction @xmath2 is increased .",
    "( iii )  unfolding the spectrum of each member of the ensemble separately yields good agreement of the fluctuation properties of the tbre with those predicted by canonical rmt .",
    "( iv )  the fluctuations of the position of the first eigenvalue of the tbre are stronger than those for the goe .",
    "( v )  the tbre is neither stationary nor ergodic .",
    "these results hold also for simplified versions of the tbre , which do not involve , or at least do so only partially , the complexity of the angular momentum algebra .",
    "early results on the @xmath48 nearest neighbour spacing distribution displayed systematic deviations between the tbre and the goe  @xcite while experimental data showed agreement with goe predictions .",
    "this seemed to suggest the existence of an effective many ",
    "body interaction in nuclei .",
    "it was soon realized , however , that the deviations were related to the method of analysis of the spectra and caused by the non  ergodic properties of the tbre  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the deviations were due to the difference between ensemble averaging and spectral averaging .",
    "ensemble averaging uses a single staircase function ( the integrated level density ) to unfold the spectra of all members of the ensemble .",
    "this function is obtained by superposing the levels of all members of the ensemble .",
    "early numerical results  @xcite ( and later analytical studies  @xcite ) had shown that in the dilute limit ( @xmath67 , @xmath7 , @xmath68 with @xmath69 ) , the mean level density is gaussian .",
    "this spectral shape was accordingly used for ensemble unfolding . on the other hand ,",
    "spectral averaging uses a separate staircase function for each member of the ensemble .",
    "it was found that the deviations from goe behaviour obtained by ensemble averaging were related to the variance of the spacing distribution ; an analytical estimate of this effect , linking ensemble and spectral average , was also obtained  @xcite .",
    "a first systematic comparison of spectral and ( a corrected ) ensemble averaging , using matrices of rather small dimensions , was carried out in reference  @xcite .",
    "this comparison showed remarkable agreement between the tbre results and the goe predictions .",
    "the agreement invalidated the earlier conclusion that nuclear interactions are mainly of many  body type , and has left open the question of the rank of the effective nuclear interaction  @xcite .",
    "unfolding the spectrum is technically a subtle task .",
    "it can considerably influence the results on spectral fluctuations .",
    "attention was therefore devoted to a consistent way of constructing ensemble averages which yield correct spectral fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "this problem has recently again attracted attention  @xcite . in the dilute limit ,",
    "the spectral density is gaussian .",
    "however , knowledge of this fact is not sufficient for a proper unfolding of the spectra of the ege(@xmath2 ) and of the tbre as obtained in numerical simulations with _",
    "finite  dimensional _ matrices .",
    "this is because for such matrices , the first and second moments of the spectrum are not ergodic  ( cf .",
    "section  [ low ] ) .",
    "hence , these moments must be normalized for every member of the ensemble .",
    "the sensitivity of the spectral fluctuations to these corrections was addressed in reference  @xcite , where either the first or the second moment , or both , are corrected for every matrix of the ensemble .",
    "the results show that , in the center of the spectrum , the nearest ",
    "neighbour spacing distribution is not sensitive to such corrections .",
    "for the two  point function , ensemble unfolding with the gaussian mean level density yields results that deviate clearly from predictions of canonical rmt . a slight correction results from adjusting the width of the distribution for every member of the ensemble .",
    "a drastic improvement is obtained when the distribution for every member of the ensemble is recentered . applying both corrections together yields results which are hardly distinguishable from those of canonical rmt .",
    "once the low moments of the spectral distributions are adjusted so as to coincide for all members of the ensemble , a polynomial fit for the ensemble staircase function is usually implemented .",
    "this procedure yields a function with which the spectra can be meaningfully unfolded .    a method for spectral unfolding which is somewhat more complicated but has a firm theoretical basis  @xcite for the embedded ensembles , uses a gram  charlier expansion . starting from the fact that in the dilute limit the spectral density is gaussian",
    ", one writes the spectral density @xmath70 of an ensemble of matrices of finite dimension in the form  @xcite @xmath71.\\ ] ] here , @xmath72 is the recentered energy in units of its standard deviation , @xmath73 is the gaussian distribution and @xmath74 is the hermite polynomial of degree @xmath24 .",
    "the hermite polynomials describe the long  wavelength oscillations of @xmath75 ( long in terms of the mean level spacing ) about the asymptotic value @xmath76 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath77 are adjusted so as to minimize @xmath78 , the overall root ",
    "mean  square error of the level  to  level deviations of the staircase function calculated from equation  ( [ num : eq1 ] ) from the data .",
    "explicit expressions for @xmath79 and @xmath80 are given in reference  @xcite .",
    "one uses equation  ( [ num : eq1 ] ) with some maximum value @xmath81 in the sum over @xmath24",
    ". this value should be sufficient to eliminate any secular trend in @xmath78 while preserving the fluctuations of the spectrum .",
    "the value of @xmath81 is usually determined by calculating @xmath78 as a function of @xmath81 , and by choosing the smallest value beyond which no significant corrections to @xmath82 are found . for the ege(@xmath2 ) this method yields good agreement with the spectral fluctuation properties predicted by canonical rmt  @xcite .",
    "the spectral fluctuation properties at the edge of the spectrum have also received increased attention .",
    "these are interesting for a comparison of tbre and egoe(@xmath2 ) results with the positions of low  lying nuclear states .",
    "bohigas and flores  @xcite compared the properties of the low  lying part of the spectrum of the tbre and of the goe .",
    "they showed that the widths of the positions of individual eigenvalues were much larger for the tbre than for the goe .",

    "@xcite fitted the nearest ",
    "neighbour spacing distribution to a brody distribution , @xmath83 $ ] with @xmath84\\right\\}^{\\omega+1}$ ] , obtaining for the brody parameter the value @xmath85 .",
    "more recent results by flores _",
    "@xcite show that the semi ",
    "poisson distribution , @xmath86 $ ] , gives a better fit than the brody distribution , if the levels of each member of the ensemble are normalized first according to an individual gaussian distribution ( spectral unfolding ) .",
    "numerical simulations using matrices of dimension @xmath87 have repeatedly found agreement between the fluctuation properties of the ege(@xmath2 ) and the tbre at the center of the spectrum on the one hand , and the predictions of canonical rmt on the other .",
    "therefore , it is often taken for granted that a random @xmath88 part in the hamiltonian is sufficient to induce level fluctuations of canonical rmt type .",
    "this point of view is at odds with the fact that many ",
    "body systems with random few  body interactions ( both for fermions and bosons ) may possess a high degree of order in the low  lying part of the spectrum  @xcite .",
    "for instance , for the tbre with all the angular momentum couplings taken into account explicitly , it was found that there is a statistical preference for @xmath89 ground states despite the fact that these states account only for a small fraction of hilbert space  @xcite .",
    "moreover , these @xmath89 ground states are separated by a gap from the lowest excited state .",
    "other properties like localization in fock space  @xcite and odd  even binding effects  @xcite show that pairing effects are robust properties of two  body interactions .",
    "such properties are usually understood in terms of hamiltonians which involve some collective behaviour .",
    "all these results , based on hamiltonians with random interactions , contradict the basic philosophy of and the predictions based on canonical rmt and suggest that the embedded ensembles may not always yield results which coincide with canonical rmt .      early analytical results by kota and potbhare  @xcite indicated a gaussian spectral density both in the dilute and in the dense limits .",
    "the dense limit which exists only for bosons , is defined as @xmath90 for fixed @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "manfredi  @xcite , using matrices of dimension @xmath91 ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) , compared for the first time the spectral fluctuation properties at the center of the spectrum of ege(@xmath2 ) for bosons with the results of canonical rmt .",
    "using spectral unfolding he concluded that there is no significant difference between the two ensembles .",
    "@xcite considered this problem in the dense limit , studying the case @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "these authors constructed the ensemble  averaged staircase function using a sixth order gram ",
    "charlier expansion  ( [ num : eq1 ] ) .",
    "they found excellent agreement with canonical rmt results for the nearest ",
    "neighbour spacing distribution ( with a brody parameter @xmath96 ) and for the @xmath97statistic .",
    "these results led them to conclude that the embedded ensembles possess generically ( for fermions and bosons ) the spectral fluctuation properties of canonical rmt .",
    "recently it was found analytically , however , that the embedded ensembles for bosons are not ergodic in the dense limit  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the fluctuations of the centroids and widths of the spectrum ( in units of the average width ) do not vanish in this limit , but attain constant values ( cf .",
    "subsection  [ low ] ) .",
    "this fact implies that unfolding the spectra by ensemble averaging or by spectral averaging will yield different results . the hilbert  space dimension for bosons",
    "is given by equation  ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the effect can be best displayed numerically for @xmath98 .",
    "figures  [ f_1 ] and  [ f_2 ] illustrate the non  ergodic behaviour for @xmath99 bosons and the case of a two  body interaction ( with @xmath100 members forming the ensemble ) for the nearest ",
    "neighbour spacing distribution and for the @xmath97statistic , both taken in the centre of the spectrum .",
    "spectral unfolding ( ensemble unfolding ) was done by fitting a polynomial of degree @xmath101 to the staircase function of each member of the ensemble ( to the ensemble  averaged staircase function , respectively ) . for ensemble unfolding ,",
    "the individual spectra were not recentered or rescaled since there is now no theoretical support for this procedure .",
    "in fact , rescaling and recentering the spectra would yield a non  gaussian average level density .",

    "the special role of the value @xmath138 is due to duality .",
    "the case of dense bosons is special : it is not ergodic .",
    "\\(ii ) what are the spectral fluctuation properties ?",
    "the supersymmetry method suggests that the spectral fluctuations are of wigner  dyson type as long as @xmath236 .",
    "it is possible that the range of validity of wigner ",
    "dyson spectral statistics extends into the domain @xmath238 although here the supersymmetry method yields also non  universal contributions . in the dilute limit , the situation is not clear .",
    "the straightforward extension of the binary correlation approximation yields poissonian statistics for @xmath7 but relies on manipulations which are mathematically questionable .",
    "the eigenvector expansion of the matrix of second moments yields expressions which change smoothly with @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 . from these expressions",
    "one would not expect a sudden transition from poissonian statistics ( which surely applies for @xmath55 ) to wigner ",
    "dyson statistics for @xmath5 .",
    "the group  theoretical approach shows that the part of @xmath27 which transforms under @xmath225 like a multiple of the unit matrix ( and , thus , leads to poissonian level statistics ) is largest for @xmath226 .",
    "the study of the correlations between many ",
    "body matrix elements provides intuitive insight into the causes responsible for deviations from wigner  dyson statistics .",
    "dense boson systems are close to integrable and display no similarity to wigner  dyson spectral statistics .",
    "\\(iii ) are these properties universal ?",
    "in analogy to canonical rmt , we ask here whether the spectral density and the spectral fluctuation properties hold irrespective of the gaussian choice for the @xmath2body matrix elements , i.e. , the variables @xmath26 defined in section  [ defi ] .",
    "this is a meaningful question : we recall that in canonical rmt , ensembles with non  gaussian weight factors have been studied . since for @xmath40 , ege(@xmath3 )",
    "is identical to canonical rmt , non  gaussian ensembles of ege(@xmath2 ) type can certainly be defined .",

    "it shows that the embedded ensembles for fermions and bosons are part of a much wider class of embedded random ",
    "matrix ensembles defined in terms of irreducible representations of some compact lie group .",
    "\\(iv ) are the spectra ergodic ?",
    "partial answers to this question come from numerical simulations , from the moments method , and from the eigenvalue expansion of the matrix of second moments .",
    "ergodicity can be expected only in the limit of infinite matrix dimension . for @xmath6 ergodicity",
    "holds for all observables . in the dilute limit",
    ", the spectral density is ergodic , but non  ergodic contributions vanish very slowly ( with inverse powers of the logarithm of the dimension of the matrices ) .",

    "even the low moments of the spectral density are not ergodic .",
    "it seems that this is the first known case of a random  matrix model which is not ergodic in the limit of infinite matrix dimension .",
