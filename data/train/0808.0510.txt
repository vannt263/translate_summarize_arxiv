    "in view of applications like the distribution of cryptographic keys @xcite or the communication between registers in quantum devices @xcite , the study of natural evolution of permanently coupled spin networks has become increasingly important . a special case of interest consists of homogenous networks of particles coupled by constant and fixed ( nearest - neighbour ) interactions .    an important feature of these networks is the possibility of faithfully transferring a qubit between specific particles without tuning the couplings or altering the network topology .",
    "this phenomenon is usually called _ perfect state transfer _ ( pst ) . since quantum networks",
    "( and communication networks in general ) are naturally associated to undirected graphs , there is a growing amount of literature on the relation between graph - theoretic properties and properties that allow pst ( see @xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "we will give necessary and sufficient conditions for pst in quantum networks modeled by a large class of _ cubelike graphs_. the vertices of a cubelike graph are the binary @xmath1-vectors ; two vertices @xmath2 and @xmath3 are adjacent if and only if their symmetric difference belongs to a chosen set .",
    "equivalently , cubelike graphs on @xmath4 vertices are the cayley graphs of the elementary abelian group of order @xmath4 @xcite .    among cubelike graphs ,",
    "the hypercube is arguably the most famous one , having many applications ranging from switching theory to computer architecture , _ etc .",
    "_ ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "there are various and diverse results about quantum dynamics on hypercubes .",
    "these are essentially embraced by two areas : continuous - time quantum walks @xcite ; quantum communication in spin networks @xcite .",
    "the common ingredient is the use of a hamiltonian representing the adjacency structure of the graph .    concerning state transfer , christandl _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that networks modeled by hypercubes are capable of transporting qubits between pairs of antipodal nodes , perfectly ( _ i.e. _ , with maximum fidelity ) and in constant time .",
    "@xcite generalized this observation , by considering a family of cubelike graphs whose members have the hypercube as a spanning subgraph ( for this reason , these authors coined the term _ dressed hypercubes _ ) .",
    "other questions related to quantum dynamics on hypercubes have been addressed in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 contains the necessary definitions and the statements of our results . a proof will be given in section 3 .",
    "this is obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonians with simple tools from fourier analysis on @xmath0 .",

    "when @xmath28 is the characteristic function of the standard generating set of @xmath0 , the graph @xmath26 is called _ hypercube_.",
    "( for example , the leftmost graph in figure 1 ) .",
    "the _ adjacency matrix _ of @xmath26 is the @xmath29 matrix @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the regular ( permutation ) representation of @xmath32 . in particular ,",

    "this is the usual space of @xmath1 qubits .",
    "if we look at the single excitation case in the xy model , the evolution of a network of spin @xmath41 quantum mechanical particles on the vertices of @xmath37 can be seen as induced by the adjacency matrix @xmath36 , which then plays the role of an hamiltonian ( for details see @xcite or @xcite ) . on the light of this observation , given two vectors @xmath42 ,",
    "the ( unnormalized ) _ transition amplitude _ between @xmath43 and @xmath44 induced by @xmath36 is the expression @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "the _ fidelity _ of state transfer between @xmath43 and @xmath44 is then @xmath47 . by definition ,",
