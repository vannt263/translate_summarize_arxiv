    "being one of the primary candidates for an effective low - energy theory of qcd , the skyrme model @xcite has relished from a large amount of study after which it was realized that it possessed the same symmetry properties as qcd in the limit of large @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the topological solitons that appear as solutions to the model s equations of motion are identified as mathematical representations of nuclear matter .",
    "these solitons , or skyrmions , are then quantized to obtain physical properties of nuclei .",
    "studies have shown that for the nucleon @xmath2 , these calculated properties are within a 30% margin of error from experimental data @xcite .",
    "however , when one raises the baryonic number to any @xmath3 , the solutions that have been obtained thus far do not correctly describe the presumed geometric properties of nuclear matter .",
    "experimental data indicates that the nucleons seem to preserve their individuality within nuclei .",
    "for example , the @xmath0 solutions have the geometrical shape of a toroid , whereas the deuteron , the only stable nuclei with @xmath0 , has the presumed shape of two deformed nucleons lightly bound together .",
    "another problem is that the binding energy of the toroidal skyrmion is much too high , roughly @xmath4 mev ( recall that the deuteron has a binding energy of 2.224 mev ) , which is also a likely contributing factor to the odd toroidal shape it possesses .",
    "even worst , both the geometrical shape and binding energy problems persist and are amplified as we increase the value of @xmath5 . for these reasons , the solitonic field configurations within the standard skyrme model can be viewed as too _",
    "malleable _ in the sense that skyrmions deform noticeably as they form a bound state . for the purpose of comparison here we shall use vibrational energies as a quantifiable measure of rigidity ( as opposed to malleability ) of the field and",
    "analyze the ratio @xmath6 , where @xmath7 labels the vibrational energy of the breathing mode and the two other eigenmodes , and where @xmath8 is the total energy of the soliton ( more on this in sec .",
    "iii ) . reaching for higher rigidity solutions",
    "can also be understood intuitively by the fact that every nucleon within a nuclei of @xmath0 or higher should presumably be deformed while maintaining its individuality within the nucleus , and not meld with others to form complex geometrical objects . a pragmatic goal towards improving",
    "the model would be to find extensions to the current model that point toward a solution to these issues .",
    "therefore , in this optic , one may consider various generalizations of the original skyrme lagrangian to find which types lowers the binding energies . in this paper , we limit our analysis to a one - parameter generalization to the standard mass term of the skyrme model .    in the following ,",
    "we begin by reviewing the standard skyrme model as well as reveal the studied generalized mass term that introduces a dimensionless parameter labeled @xmath9 . initially considered and analyzed by piette and zakrewski @xcite , this new mass term is studied further in the context of rigidity here using the simulated - annealing numerical algorithm to accurately and effectively minimize the pion field configuration .",
    "these exact solutions allow us to deepen our understanding of the dependency between binding energies and the parameter @xmath9 , and will also enable us to conclude that solitonic solutions obtained through the rational map ansatz @xcite are not good indicators of this dependence ( sec .",
    "we consider solutions for @xmath2 and @xmath0 with axially symmetric configurations .",
    "for @xmath2 , axial symmetry is an exact symmetry both for the static solution and the rotationally deformed solution .",
    "both calculation will be performed providing a quantitative insight on such deformations otherwise shown to be significant @xcite .",
    "for @xmath10 the situation is somewhat different .",
    "rotational deformation breaks axial symmetry and would in principle require a full 3d computation .",
    "so only the static energy will be minimized for the @xmath0 case even though axially symmetric solutions were found to be a good approximation in @xcite .",
    "this was done in order to make the numerical efforts more tractable and time efficient .",
    "furthermore , the same solutions are used to compute how the vibrational energies of three eigenstates behave as we increase @xmath9 .",
    "the methods used for this analysis is outlined in sec .",
    "iii , and the results indicate quantitatively that the mass term increases the rigidity of skyrmions with @xmath2 while its effect on the binding energy depend on ( iso-)spin .",
    "the model initially proposed by skyrme comprised of the two term lagrangian @xmath11^{2}\\right )   \\right ]   , \\label{eq - s1}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 are the chiral currents associated to the three component pion fields @xmath13 such that the @xmath14 matrix @xmath15 is defined by @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 are respectively the pion decay constant and the dimensionless skyrme parameter .",
    "the @xmath19 s found in ( [ eq - u ] ) are simply the pauli matrices , and the field @xmath20 is an additional scalar field that must satisfy the constraint @xmath21 in order to avoid adding unphysical degrees of freedom and to enable the possibility of having solitonic solutions .",
    "each solution to ( [ eq - s1 ] ) with boundary condition @xmath22 fall into distinct topological sectors that are distinguished by their given topological charge , or baryon number .",
    "for @xmath2 , spherical symmetry can be utilized to extract a convincing picture of a nucleon through the use of the ansatz @xmath23 where one only has to solve an ordinary differential equation involving the chiral angle @xmath24 that ( [ eq - s1 ] ) brings about @xcite .    however , the physics that ( [ eq - s1 ] ) describes lacks in many respects .",
    "first , it is possible to add as many higher order terms of the form @xmath25^{n})$ ] as one wishes , to account for all possible interactions , and it is simply unknown how the sum of such terms would affect the resulting solutions @xcite although it is generally assumed that higher order terms in derivatives could be neglected in the low - energy limit .",
    "one may also wonder if the two terms of ( [ eq - s1 ] ) , among all the possible terms , are really the two optimal ones for portraying the physics of nuclear matter .",
    "second , all solutions for @xmath26 obtained thus far do not correctly characterize the presumed geometric properties of nuclei that are found in nature .",
    "third , it does not take into account the mass the of pions , but fortunately , this problem is easier to resolve .",
    "one can simply add a chiral symmetry breaking term proportional to the pion mass squared , which has first been successfully introduced by adkins and nappi @xcite , in the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the pion mass ( we assume that the three pions @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are of equal masses ) .",
    "this term has had the added benefit of eliminating shell - like configurations and favoring energy densities that are higher at their centers , which is more appealing since it is known that nucleons have roughly even matter densities within their shell radii .",
    "hence , the lagrangian ( [ eq - s1 ] ) together with the mass term ( [ eq - m1 ] ) is what we consider to be the standard skyrme model .",
    "of course , as we have mentioned , many additions and modifications can be made , particularly to the mass term ( [ eq - m1 ] ) .",
    "if we only constrain ourselves to mass terms that obey the boundary condition ( [ boundary ] ) , kopeliovich , piette and zakrzewski @xcite have shown that a generalized mass term can have the form @xmath32 where the function @xmath33 and constant @xmath34 must obey @xmath35 however , of the many mass terms that are evidently possible , we will study a particular one - parameter family that has the additional property of disfavoring shell - like configurations as did the standard mass term ( [ eq - m1 ] ) .",
    "one then hope that this _ new _ term might also improve the overall properties of skyrmions , such as providing a better account of their binding energies .",
    "this one - parameter mass term is @xmath36 is based on the function @xmath37 where @xmath38 and the parameter @xmath9 can span the range @xmath39 . at @xmath40 , we note that the mass term is infinite .",
    "following their original proposal of the general term ( [ massg ] ) , piette and zakrzewski @xcite studied ( [ eq - md ] ) with the use of rational map ( rm ) solutions . in sec .",
    "iv , we will show the results of a similar study that use exact numerical solutions instead of approximate rm map solutions .",
    "this will demonstrate the limitations of the rational map ansatz when it comes to give a precise measurement of the binding energies as a function of @xmath9 , especially as it approaches the critical value of 0.2 .",
    "before we discuss binding energies , we will describe in the following section how the study of vibrational modes , a worthy study in its own right , can lead us to quantitatively understand how the @xmath2 solutions gradually get more rigid as @xmath9 increases .",
    "the methods used in this paper for calculating the vibrational energies were previously outlined by hadjuk andt schwesinger @xcite , which can be contrasted with the techniques of barnes et al . @xcite and of lin and piette @xcite where the latter performed their vibrational calculations using rational map solutions .",
    "originally put forward by hajduk and schwesinger @xcite , the method for obtaining the vibrational modes and their energies begins by performing the global scale transformation @xmath41 where the @xmath42 are scaling parameters , and where we have assumed that the scaling is uniform with respect to the cartesian coordinates @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the advantage of such a scaling lies in its simplicity both in its mathematical and numerical treatment .",
    "its disadvantage is that it is certainly not as general as would be an arbitrary local scale transformation .",
    "however , it allows to compute vibrational modes that probe the global _ rigidity _ of skyrmions , giving us a clearer indication whether or not ( and how ) the field configurations are getting more _ rigid _ with respect to the parameter @xmath9 . substituting ( [ scaling ] ) into ( [ eq - s1 ] ) together with the new mass term ( [ eq - md ] ) yields a lagrangian of the form @xmath46 where the matrices @xmath47 and @xmath48 are obtained by direct inspection after all substitutions are made . since we are only concerned with small amplitude oscillations , we perform an expansion around the minimum of @xmath49 by taking @xmath50 which results in the expansion of @xmath51 and @xmath49 as @xmath52 keeping only terms up to order @xmath53 gives us the lagrangian @xmath54 in order to compute the vibrational hamiltonian we must now find a coordinate transformation that satisfies @xmath55 where @xmath56 . when such a transformation is found , it gives @xmath57 which can simply be turned into the hamiltonian @xmath58 we now need to diagonalize the matrix @xmath59 in order to obtain the vibrational eigenstates and eigenvalues . thus , we need to solve the eigenvalue equation @xmath60 where the matrix @xmath5 must satisfy @xmath61 .",
    "the energies associated to the eigenstates @xmath62 , @xmath63 , et @xmath64 are then @xmath65 however , in our study , we set the zero - point energy to zero , in other words we set @xmath66 because the zero - point energy of vibrational modes is ill - defined .",
    "this is procedurally how we obtained our eigenstates ( eigen - modes ) and eigenvalues ( eigen - energies ) from our numerical solutions .",
    "but , before we discuss the results of our vibrational analysis of @xmath2 solitons , we must briefly describe what exactly are the numerical solutions we are working with . for simplicity",
    ", we shall from hereon identify vibrational frequencies @xmath67 as vibrational energies although they are not exactly the same ( see eqn .",
    "( [ ew ] ) ) .    beginning from the lagrangian ( [ eq - s1 ] ) , we added the mass term ( [ eq - md ] ) , yielding the _ static _ energy @xmath68^{2}\\right ) \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ &   + \\frac{m_{\\pi}^{2}f_{\\pi}^{2}}{8(1 - 5d)}\\,tr\\,(\\mathbf{1}-u - d(u^{2}-u^{3 } ) ) , \\label{estatic}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 and @xmath70 run over spatial components only and @xmath5 is the baryonic number .",
    "the minimal energy skyrmion for @xmath2 and @xmath0 turns out to have spherical and axial symmetry respectively .",
    "since we are only interested by these values of @xmath5 , the general solution will be cast in the form of the axial ansatz @xmath71 introduced in @xcite where @xmath72 is a three - component unit vector that is independent of @xmath73 .",
    "the boundary conditions at infinity implies that @xmath74 as @xmath75 .",
    "moreover , we must impose that @xmath76 and @xmath77 at @xmath78 .    with the axial ansatz ( [ eq : solaxiale ] )",
    ", we can also set the scaling length and energy in units of @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively and @xmath80 as units of length and energy respectively .",
    "] , giving expressions for the static energy and the baryon number that read @xmath81 @xmath82 with @xmath83 .    also , for all our minimizations , we fixed the constants @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath28 to @xmath84 the values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 were set according to ref .",
    "@xcite for comparative purposes . at such values",
    ", the skyrme model reproduces the mass of the nucleon and of the delta when one discounts the mass term @xcite .",
    "regarding the mass term , @xmath28 is set to its experimental value and the parameter @xmath9 varies in order to probe how the mass term in ( [ estatic ] ) might affect the skyrmion s properties . of course , when the mass term is switched on , the prediction for the nucleon and delta masses will deviate from their experimental values .",
    "this could be corrected with an appropriate choice of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , however here we shall retain @xmath85 mev and @xmath86 mev@xmath87 , since we are more interested in certain ratios of energies than in the actual values of energies , and comparisons with earlier works are easier .    physical states such as the nucleon and the deuteron require an additional contribution to the energy , the rotational and isorotational energy due to spin and isospin of these states . for the nucleon , this is done by fixing the quantum numbers of spin and isospin to @xmath88 , and assuming axial symmetry , it leads to the total isorotational and rotational energy of the form @xmath89   .",

    "we proceed with the appropriate scaling transformation , perform the diagonalization , and finally calculate the eigen - energies of each vibrational mode . by the form of our diagonalization ( [ diag ] ) ,",
    "it is clear that we would obtain strictly three eigenvectors depicting three types of vibration for each solution .",
    "strikingly , but comprehensibly , no matter the value of @xmath9 , the three types of vibration obtained were always of the same form .",
    "the first type observed may be identified to the well - known breathing mode described by the eigenvector @xmath104 in cartesian coordinates .",

    "the dashed line represents the experimentally measured mass of the deuteron over twice the mass of an individual nucleon ( @xmath144 ) .    clearly",

    "[ figuretrois ] ) diminish considerably without ever crossing the dashed line or the value @xmath146 which corresponds to the limit of instability of the @xmath0 solution .",
    "the sharp increase in @xmath147 suggest that it may be possible to adjust the value of @xmath9 such that the relative importance of the binding energy would be arbitrarily small  of course , the solution would still be of toroidal form which is presumably not that of the deuteron .",
    "some cautionary comments are in order here .",
    "first the last point for this set of data shows a sharp increase of the binding energy at @xmath119 .",
    "it is at the boundary of the region of breakdown of our numerical technique and attempts to obtain stable solutions as we push @xmath9 closer to 0.2 were not successful .",
    "also the limit @xmath148 is ill - defined and approaching this limit is physically questionable as the contributions of the mass term which breaks the @xmath149 symmetry gets relatively large .    surprisingly , the situation is more obscure for the deuteron - nucleon data . a first set of data , based on static energy minimization ( squares in fig .",
    "[ figuretrois ] ) , shows that the relative importance of the binding energy is quite insensitive to @xmath9 up to @xmath150 but increases ( i.e. @xmath151 decreases ) dramatically as @xmath9 approaches the critical value of @xmath152 contrarily to what is observed for the spinless skyrmion .",
    "this is entirely due to the distinct behavior of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 rotational energies . of course rotational deformations may affect this behaviour",
    ". to provide some measure of that effect we present a third set of points on fig .",
    "[ figuretrois ] ( circles ) where @xmath147 is computed with the @xmath0 static and @xmath2 rotationally deformed solutions .",
    "note that an exact full 3d @xmath0 rotationally deformed computation would lower @xmath153 and so this third set of data represent the absolute maximum of @xmath147 for the deuteron - nucleon system .",
    "again the mass term ( [ eq - md ] ) that we analyzed always lead to bound states ( @xmath154 ) which is an interesting result by itself .",
    "however the observation of this opposite behavior with respect to the parameter @xmath9 for these last two sets of data emphasizes the importance of the rotational deformations .",
    "it may well be that a full 3d computation of @xmath155 deformed solution leads to a behaviour closer to that of the second set of data ( squares ) but our results does not allow to infer on the exact nature of the bound state for the deuteron . perhaps a full 3d computation allowing for non - axial deformation of the deuteron would conclude otherwise .",
    "it is also clear that the bound states of spinless skyrmions and deuteron - nucleon system may show completely different behaviour .",
    "( triangles ) and @xmath156 ( squares ) as a function of the mass parameter @xmath9 .",
    "the dashed line at @xmath146 corresponds to the limit of instability of the bound state whereas the experimental value for @xmath157 , i.e. very close to 1.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    additionally , these results put into question the conclusions obtained by piette and zakrzewski @xcite .",
    "their results show that for a @xmath9 larger than approximately 0.12 , the toroidal configuration is an unstable one because its total energy is larger than twice that of a single nucleon .",
    "more precisely , their results indicate that the ratio @xmath158 crosses 1 at @xmath159 and continues to increase afterwards , in contradiction with our results ( fig .",
    "[ figuretrois ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy suggests that the use of the rational map ansatz does not adequately minimize the energies of the @xmath0 configurations , and that we can not have too much confidence in its ability to truly find the minimal solutions of any @xmath26 .",
    "hence , the more exact simulated - annealing approach for finding solutions may be the best way to decipher which model types are more suitable than others .",
    "it may also be the only method for finding out why the @xmath0 skyrmion has a toroidal shape in the first place .",
    "there is also certainly a link to make between the increasing rigidity ( characterized by @xmath160 ) and the changing binding energy of the solitons as a function of @xmath9 which also depends on the nature of the solitons , ( iso-)spinless or deuteron - nucleons system . in our view , both characteristics are needed for a better model , and hence adds to the appeal of further dynamical or mass terms such as ( [ eq - md ] ) .",
    "from the behaviors of the binding energies ( fig . [ figuretrois ] ) and the breathing mode energies ( fig . [ figuredeux]a ) , we can assert that the mass term ( [ eq - md ] ) with a non - zero value of @xmath9 does not quantitatively succeed in providing a consistent model of nuclear matter in the sense that the experimental value for binding energy of the deuteron was not attainable for the values of @xmath161 considered here .",
    "it also emphasize the need for rotationally deformed @xmath162 computations to determine the exact behaviour as @xmath147 seems to be very sensitive to rotational deformation near @xmath40",
    ". meanwhile it may be premature to conjecture the exact deuteron - nucleon behaviour on the basis of the results for spinless solitons .",
    "our results have also shown that in contrast to the rational map solutions of piette and zakrzewski , the behavior of the ratio @xmath158 never crosses 1 and seems only to approach 1 in the limit of @xmath163 .",
    "hence , this indicates not only that the @xmath0 is a bound state for all values of @xmath9 considered in this work , but it also demonstrates the clear limitations of the rational map ansatz in providing exact quantitative insight into how the model behaves and works . in conjunction with the behavior of the binding energies , the ratio of @xmath160 shows that as @xmath9 increases the field configurations are more resistant to being vibrationally excited , which is indicative of more rigid solitons and perhaps a relation between rigidity and larger binding energies for the deuteron .",
    "all calculations relied on fixed values for the parameters of the skyrme model ( except for @xmath9 ) mostly for comparison purposes with previous work .",
    "these parameters are usually fitted to reproduce the experimental values of the mass of the nucleon and delta or other physical quantities .",
    "indeed , the values of the energies we have obtained were sometimes far from those of experimental data .",
    "therefore , some of our conclusions may no longer hold for a more physical choice of skyrme parameters despite the fact that they were based on the relative importance of each quantity . on the other hand ,",
    "three dimensional simulated - annealing programs will be needed to explore baryonic numbers beyond 2 , and to confirm the validity of axially symmetric solutions for @xmath0 .",
    "regarding the prospect of obtaining 2-nucleon shape solitons for @xmath0 , it would seem that the mass term in ( [ eq - md ] ) is not sufficient and perhaps we need to rethink what type of lagrangian would permit such a minimal configuration . in any event , it is also possible to add as many parameters in the mass term ( [ eq - md ] ) with higher powers of @xmath15 as we wish , and this alone may lead us towards a sounder effective theory of qcd ."
