    "the advent of ultrafast xuv  and even x - ray light sources that can be synchronized to optical or ir  laser pulses has given rise to several recent studies of the transient absorption of such radiation by laser - dressed atoms , both experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite .",
    "for example , many of the experiments done in attosecond physics involve the transient absorption of attosecond xuv  radiation by atoms interacting with an ir  laser field .",
    "this is because the strong - field process of high harmonic generation ( hhg ) , which is used to produce the attosecond xuv  radiation as either single pulses or trains of pulses , results in the xuv  field being precisely synchronized with the driving ir  field @xcite .",
    "it is then possible to perform experiments using the xuv  field and a replica of the original ir  field with attosecond precision @xcite .",
    "et al . _ also showed that it is possible to overlap pulses of synchrotron - produced soft x - ray radiation with an 800 nm dressing laser in a study of laser - induced transparency in neon  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we explore how an ultrafast xuv  pulse interacts with a simple atom , helium , in the presence of a moderately strong ir  field which may be either shorter or longer in duration than the xuv  pulse .",
    "we have as our goal formulating theoretical methods that can be used to calculate the absorption and emission of xuv  radiation by strongly dressed atoms even when the xuv  pulses are on the femtosecond time scale , and may include multiple frequencies in a comb .",
    "in addition we want to be able to study the transient absorption and reshaping of radiation as it propagates through a macroscopic amount of gas .",
    "we will restrict ourselves in this study to cases where the ir  laser dresses the atom without appreciably exciting it , leaving higher ir  intensities for a future paper .",
    "we will also restrict ourselves to xuv  wavelengths and intensities where single excitations below the first ionization threshold at 24.6 ev dominate the xuv  absorption .",
    "even given these restrictions , the ir  laser has a substantial impact on the rydberg and continuum states of the atom and , in this way , enables profound control over resonant xuv absorption  @xcite .    in the calculations we present we will consider the simplest case , where there are just two radiation fields , one which dresses the atom and one which is absorbed and possibly reshaped .",
    "the fundamental problem of a two - color field like this has been studied before in the context of x - ray absorption by neon  @xcite , argon  @xcite , and krypton  @xcite atoms . specifically , the examination of laser - dressed atoms led to the discovery of electromagnetically induced transparency  ( eit ) for x - rays  @xcite , better characterized as autler - townes splitting  @xcite because the transparency is not predominantly caused by destructive interference",
    ". there have also been several studies of helium in the context of the two - color problem we are discussing .",
    "it was investigated with an optical laser and the xuv  free electron laser in hamburg  @xcite , and the impact of laser - dressing helium on the production of xuv  radiation via high harmonic generation  ( hhg ) was studied theoretically in  @xcite .",
    "we begin by characterizing the single atom response in terms of the cross section for absorption of xuv  radiation of frequency @xmath3 .",
    "first we calculate the linear , frequency - dependent xuv  absorption cross section using a floquet - like method ( non - hermitian perturbation theory ",
    "nhpt ) that treats the xuv  field as a monochromatic source .",
    "this method has been extensively tested in the context of x - ray absorption on the @xmath4  resonance of laser - dressed neon , alluded to above  @xcite .",
    "next , we outline a method using direct integration of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) which achieves essentially the same goal using pulses of finite duration .",
    "the cross section is extracted by projecting out the initial state from the final state wave function .",
    "the two methods , nhpt and the tdse - projection method , are shown to agree when the xuv  pulse bandwidth is very small .",
    "the tdse - projection approach is , however , potentially more flexible in dealing with situations where the dressing laser couples many states of the atom .",
    "we find that the tdse - projection method can be used with a reasonable amount of effort to study laser - dressed absorption over a wide range of xuv  frequencies and dressing wavelengths . as an example of the usefulness of the method",
    ", we show representative results for several dressing wavelengths between 0.4 and 2.0 @xmath5 .",
    "we next extend the treatment of the xuv  interaction to deal with cases where the atomic response varies as a function of time or frequency in a non - trivial way .",
    "this could for instance be because the ir  dressing pulse is so short that non - adiabatic effects cause the cross section to vary substantially over the bandwidth of the pulse .",
    "another interesting situation is when the ir  pulse is so strong that multiphoton processes cause the atom to exchange energy with the light field over a large range of frequencies in many different orders of nonlinearity , so that it is no longer practical to ( artificially ) separate the linear / non - linear absorption from the driven linear / non - linear emission .",
    "we therefore develop a time - frequency approach to the atomic response , based on the time - dependent energy exchange between the atom and the light fields .",
    "our method is similar in spirit to the treatment provided by for instance tannor @xcite and pollard and mathies @xcite with the important difference that we are not separating the atomic response into different linear and non - linear orders but keeping everything in one frequency dependent response function .",
    "we find that when we use long ( @xmath630 fs ) xuv  pulses we get good agreement between linear absorption cross sections calculated using the time - frequency and the tdse - projection cross section .",
    "having obtained this good agreement over a range of frequencies and dressing laser intensities gives us confidence that we can calculate the full time - frequency response of the dressed atom .",
    "finally we show how this time - frequency approach is consistent with our solution of the coupled maxwell wave equation ( mwe ) and the tdse .",
    "this allows for a generalized , _ ab - initio _ description of linear and non - linear absorption , emission , and phase matching in a macroscopic medium .",
    "we apply this formalism to studying the propagation of an xuv  pulse in a macroscopic helium gas dressed by a moderately intense 11  fs , 1600  nm laser pulse .",
    "we find that the xuv  pulse , which is resonant with the @xmath2  transition in the undressed atom , undergoes rich temporal absorption and reshaping dynamics .",

    "has the advantage that it goes to zero on a finite support , which allows us to satisfy the requirement @xmath42 exactly .    in the tdse - projection formalism",
    "we also need to dress the atom with a laser field with frequency @xmath50 .",
    "we do this by using a laser field of the form @xmath51 the envelope function @xmath52 is now a trapezoidal pulse with a linear ramp of one optical cycle at each end and a flat section that completely spans over the xuv  pulse .",
    "the pulse contains an integer number of laser cycles , so we again obtain zero vector potential at the end of the dressing pulse .",
    "we assume this field is too weak to excite or ionize the atom on its own , an assumption that we can explicitly check by running the calculation once without the xuv  field .    to calculate the cross section for absorption we begin with the atom in its ground state @xmath53 at time @xmath54 and use the grid - based methods of reference  @xcite to propagate the wave function forward in time until the end of the combined xuv  and dressing pulse at time @xmath55 . at this time",

    "we extend the treatment of the xuv  interaction to deal with cases where the atomic response varies as a function of time or frequency in a non - trivial way .",

    "( [ sigmatd ] ) we also calculate @xmath102 from @xmath103 for normalization purposes .",
    "the window function on the time - dependent acceleration is necessary in particular in those cases where the xuv  light is resonant with an atomic transition .",
    "the xuv  light then induces a strong coherence between the ground state and the excited state which in the numerical calculation will go on `` ringing '' until long after the xuv  pulse is over .",
    "this ringing does not correspond to stimulated emission or absorption of xuv  radiation .",
    "the window function we use is a trigonometric function as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gaussenv ] ) and is in general chosen to have the same fwhm duration as the longer of the ir  and xuv  pulses .",
    "the choice of window function has some influence on the value of the cross section for the un - dressed atom around the field - free resonances . when the atom is laser - dressed so that the xuv  light is no longer absorbed as strongly , the ringing is strongly suppressed by the laser field and the influence of the window function is very small .",
    "it is interesting to note here that for intense or few - cycle ir  fields , and/or for multi - mode xuv  fields , the sign of the response function @xmath83 ( and therefore the sign of the generalized cross section ) for a particular frequency @xmath104 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : respfunction ] ) can be positive or negative .",
    "when @xmath83 is positive the atom will predominantly absorb light of that frequency , and when @xmath83 is negative the atom will predominantly emit light of that frequency .",
    "this makes the response function a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of the light - atom energy exchange , in particular in combination with a sliding time - window on the time - dependent acceleration .",
    "this would in principle allow for the time - resolution of when different frequencies are absorbed or emitted during a dynamical process .",
    "we will discuss a simple application of this in connection with the macroscopic reshaping of an xuv  pulse presented in the results section .",
    "as we will show at the end of this section , the relationship derived in the previous section , between the dipole spectrum driven by an arbitrary pulse and the absorption cross section for the frequencies contained in that pulse , is consistent with our general framework for the interaction between an ultrafast , multi - color pulse and a macroscopic medium .",
    "this framework consists of the coupled solutions of the mwe and the tdse for all frequencies @xmath104 of the electric field @xmath105 of the multi - color pulse .",

    "sec : timefreq ] .",
    "as the driving field for the tdse calculation we use the evolving electric field @xmath74 at the plane @xmath111 .",
    "this means that @xmath108 in general includes both the linear and nonlinear response of the atom to the multicolor field .",

    "in much of the work described in the literature , see for instance @xcite , the non - linear response is separated from the linear response , and the propagation of the newly generated radiation ( via nonlinear processes ) is separated from the propagation of the driving field .",
    "absorption and dispersion of different frequency components of the light fields are then added separately , typically using tabulated , frequency - dependent values .",

    "however , it can not describe ultrafast or dynamical reshaping of the xuv  pulses driven by for instance absorption , dispersion , or laser - induced transparency .",
    "more generally , processes that are due to the combined response to the strong dressing or driving laser field and the weaker xuv  fields are not described in a self - consistent manner because the generated radiation is not included into the driving field .    in the following",
    "we will argue that the approach presented in this paper , which allows us to calculate the non - linear response of the dressed atom , also allows us to describe the absorption and dispersion of the ultrafast pulses in a self - consistent manner , to within the sae approximation .",

    "as in the earlier study , the transparency in helium is caused predominantly by autler - townes splitting brought about by the strong one photon coupling induced by the dressing laser , in this case between the @xmath146 and @xmath170 states .",
    "we investigated the macroscopic reshaping of an ultrafast xuv  pulse resonant with this transition , for the case when the transparency is induced by an ir  pulse which is substantially shorter than the xuv  pulse .",
