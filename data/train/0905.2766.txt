    "many potential applications of graphene require an electronic gap to switch between conducting and insulating states .",
    "a successful step in this direction has been achieved by recent experiments with hydrogenated graphene ( graphane ) @xcite and with gated bilayer graphene @xcite .",

    "one enters a new field in graphene , where one can switch between conducting and insulating regimes of a two - dimensional material , either by a chemical process ( e.g. oxidation or hydrogenation ) or by applying an external electric field @xcite .",
    "the opening of a gap can be observed experimentally either by a direct measurement of the density of states ( e.g. , by scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite ) or indirectly by measuring transport properties . in the gapless case",
    "we observe a metallic conductivity @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the diffusion coefficient ( which is proportional to the scattering time ) and @xmath2 is the density of states ( dos ) .",
    "this gives typically a conductivity of the order of @xmath3 .",
    "the gapped case , on the other hand , has a strongly temperature - dependent conductivity due to thermal activation of charge carriers @xcite @xmath4 with some characteristic temperature scale @xmath5 which depends on the underlying model .",

    "the experimental observation of a metal - insulator transition in graphane raises two questions : ( i ) what are the details that describe the opening of a gap and ( ii ) what is the dos in the insulating phase ? in this paper we will focus on the mechanism of the gap opening due to a sbp in mlg and blg .",
    "it is crucial for our study that the sbp is not uniform in the realistic two - dimensional material .",
