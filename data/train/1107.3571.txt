    "<S> we find chiral charge order in the superconductor 2h - tas@xmath0 using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy ( stm / s ) at 0.1 k. topographic images show hexagonal atomic lattice and charge density wave ( cdw ) with clockwise and counterclockwise charge modulations . </S>",
    "<S> tunneling spectroscopy reveals the superconducting density of states , disappearing at t@xmath1 = 1.75 k and showing a wide distribution of values of the superconducting gap , centered around @xmath2=0.28 mev .    since the suggestion by anderson and blount@xcite that charge order may appear in metals and superconductors , the size and anisotropy of charge density wave ( cdw ) modulations are an intensely debated issue@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> layered compounds , such as hexagonal bilayer stackings of dichalcogenides , named 2h , have received attention because the charge order is only partial and clean metallic behavior is ubiquitously observed . in the 2h series of tase@xmath3 , tas@xmath3 , nbse@xmath3 and nbs@xmath3 , the critical temperature of the cdw decreases from around 120 k in 2h - tase@xmath3 , to 80 k in 2h - tas@xmath3 , down to 30 k in 2h - nbse@xmath3 and finally no cdw in 2h - nbs@xmath3 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> superconductivity coexists with cdw , with a superconducting critical temperature t@xmath1 which increases from around 0.2 k in 2h - tase@xmath3 up to 7.2 k and 6 k in , respectively 2h - nbse@xmath3 and 2h - nbs@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> generally it is believed that their mutual interaction is competitive , as charge order usually drives towards insulating behavior , and superconductivity towards perfect conductance . </S>",
    "<S> however , evidence for cooperative interactions , which actually shape the form of the gap over the fermi surface , have been found in angular resolved photoemission @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cdw significantly shapes the anisotropy of the superconducting properties of the compound 2h - nbse@xmath3 , producing vortex cores with a star shaped cross section , instead of the tubular cores expected in a simple isotropic s - wave superconductor@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the fermi surface of all four 2h compounds ( 2h - tase@xmath3 , 2h - tas@xmath3 , 2h - nbse@xmath3 and 2h - nbs@xmath3 ) consists essentially of warped tubes deriving from the d electrons of the transition metal , with a strong hybridization to the p electrons of the chalcogen@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> calculations find that , generally , p - electron derived bands of the chalcogens do not cross the fermi level , with the important exception of 2h - nbse@xmath3 , where they form a small 3d pocket@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the charge order properties have been studied in the whole series , although usually at temperatures well above liquid helium ( see e.g. @xcite ) . only the superconducting properties of 2h - nbse@xmath3 and of 2h - nbs@xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> have been analyzed in some detail , finding peculiar multigap superconducting behavior @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , in the related semimetallic compound 1t - tise@xmath3 ( the 1 t trigonal arrangement of single layers produces generally semimetallic or semiconducting systems @xcite ) , cdw has been found with novel properties . </S>",
    "<S> 1t - tise@xmath3 presents the hitherto unique feature of alternating sheets with a 3d helical stacking of intralayer charge modulation with the helical axis perpendicular to the layers@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> domains which are mirror images of each other , and can not be brought together with only rotation operations , are found over the surface . the question </S>",
    "<S> if such kind of chiral charge order can appear in a superconductor with cdw has not been addressed . </S>",
    "<S> chiral symmetry is a particular example of absence of space parity , a concept of fundamental importance in bcs theory . to our knowledge , the only known superconductor where chiral symmetry is presently debated is the p - wave superconductor sr@xmath3ruo@xmath4@xcite . in sr@xmath3ruo@xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> , the chiral symmetry appears due to cooper pair wavefunction phase winding at the superconducting transition , related to the particular form of the p - wave order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> how superconductivity evolves out of a chiral electronic environment , however , has yet to be worked out . </S>",
    "<S> here we find for the first time chiral charge order in a metallic compound , 2h - tas@xmath3 , which , in addition , superconducts below 1.75k . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss chiral properties of cdw in this material , and determine the superconducting density of states from tunneling spectroscopy .    </S>",
    "<S> 2h - tas@xmath3 single crystals were synthesised using a iodine transport method . </S>",
    "<S> stoichiometric amounts of the elements were sealed under vacuum in a silica tube with a small amount of iodine ( 5mg/@xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the tube was then heated for a period of 15 days in a gradient furnace ( @xmath650@xmath7c along the tube ) with the mixture located in the high temperature zone ( @xmath6 800@xmath7c ) . </S>",
    "<S> this synthesis yielded layered crystals some hundreds of @xmath8 m size that exhibit x - ray diffraction patterns corresponding to 2h - tas@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> for scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) measurements , we use a stm in a partially home - made dilution refrigerator set - up described in detail elsewhere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the set - up features the possibility to mount several very small ( some tens of micron size ) single crystals and change the position of the tip from one sample to the other in - situ , at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the gold tip can be moved to a sample of gold to clean and sharpen , and the energy resolution of the set - up is of 15@xmath8ev . </S>",
    "<S> scanning was made at constant current with tunneling conductances of some 0.1 @xmath8s and bias voltages usually below 10 mv . </S>",
    "<S> several 2h - tas@xmath3 samples were glued one by one using silver epoxy on an au substrate , and measured at 100 mk . </S>",
    "<S> samples were mechanically cleaved using scotch tape prior to the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> after cleaving , clean atomically flat surfaces are easily found , with the exposed surface composed of hexagons of the chalcogen atomic layer .     </S>",
    "<S> -0 cm    the stm topography at constant current of 2h - tas@xmath3 taken at 100 mk is shown in fig.1a . </S>",
    "<S> the hexagonal atomic s lattice is nicely observed , together with a remarkable triangular 3x3 charge modulation of wavelength 3 times the lattice constant . </S>",
    "<S> the fourier transform of the whole image ( right panel of fig.1a ) shows that the cdw modulation is located at one third the in - plane reciprocal lattice wavevectors , within experimental error of @xmath9 1% . </S>",
    "<S> the cdw modulation leads to hexagons spanned by 3 vectors parallel to the three symmetry axis of the hexagonal atomic lattice , repeating itself in the topography . </S>",
    "<S> we identify two regions with different hexagonal patterns produced by the cdw modulation , marked by white rectangles in fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> in each region , within a given hexagon , the amplitude of the charge density along the three principal cdw vectors has an angular dependence , breaking six - fold rotational symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude relationship between the three modulations varies when going from the upper left corner to the lower right corner . </S>",
    "<S> in fig.1b we show representative topography profiles along the three cdw wavevectors . </S>",
    "<S> the cdw amplitude is highest along the red arrow direction in the upper left corner , and along the green arrow direction in the lower right corner . </S>",
    "<S> the hexagonal pattern spanning the cdw modulation , changes as a function of the position in the image , without any step or impurity cutting the image in two . </S>",
    "<S> note that both parts can not be transferred into each other by a simple rotation .        </S>",
    "<S> -1.2 cm    the angular dependence of the cdw modulation observed in the real space can be further characterized by making a detailed fourier analysis . </S>",
    "<S> if we look at the fourier transforms of the two different areas marked by rectangles in fig.1a , we find that the amplitude of cdw bragg peaks decrease clockwise ( in r ) and counter - clockwise ( in l ) , respectively . the normalized amplitude relationships for , respectively , @xmath10 ( red ) , @xmath11 ( orange ) , and @xmath12 ( green ) , are 1 - 0.6 - 0.4 for the upper part of the image ( r in fig.2b ) , and 0.6 - 0.8 - 1 for the bottom part of the image ( l in fig.2b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is not followed by the intensity changes of the lattice bragg peaks and evidences the presence of chiral domains in the cdw of 2h - tas@xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distribution of the chiral domains can be imaged by further fourier analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we first fourier transform the whole real space image ( shown in fig.1a ) , center the resulting fourier image at the peak corresponding to cdw s component with highest amplitude in the upper left corner domain ( q@xmath13 ) , filter the rest of the image out , and re - transform into real space . </S>",
    "<S> this gives us the real space dependence of the cdw amplitude corresponding to the wavevector q@xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> we then make the same procedure for the cdw modulation corresponding to q@xmath14 which has the highest amplitude in the lower right corner domain . finally , we subtract both images@xcite obtaining the map of the relative height between both modulations ( fig.2c ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use red color for the area where q@xmath13 has highest amplitude , and green color for the area where q@xmath14 has highest amplitude ( fig.2c ) . </S>",
    "<S> white color is used for the boundary , where both modulations have equal amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the areas with different cdw modulations is rather large , of up to 10 nm , and their boundary is irregular .    </S>",
    "<S> the height of the atomic and cdw fourier bragg peaks measured in the transition metal di - chalcogenides depends always on the direction . </S>",
    "<S> this is the result of the complex moir - pattern , with very different hexagonal symmetry structures appearing in different positions , ubiquitously observed in these materials ( see e.g. @xcite ) . calculating precisely the local density of states to obtain such patterns </S>",
    "<S> is a problem of great complexity . </S>",
    "<S> tip - sample coupling , depending on the detailed band structure of the sample , and of the form and geometry of the tip , or defects , shape considerably the measured local density of states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , moir patterns of 2h - nbse@xmath3 have been widely discussed in literature , and related to different tip - sample coupling effects . in 2h - tas@xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> within the same image , without any change in the properties of the tip nor of the surface ( i.e. without any step , defect , or surface anomaly ) , the moir patterns change its symmetry properties , in a rather complex way , as shown in figs . 1 and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> this was first found in 1t - tise@xmath3 @xcite , and , to the best of our knowledge , was never observed previously in any metallic 2h dichalcogenide compound . </S>",
    "<S> to explain such patterns , it is needed to consider out - of - plane decoupling of the three components of the cdw , which are combined in two different ways in different areas of the surface , giving chiral cdw order@xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> -1,0 cm    microscopic origin of chiral charge arrangements is now under debate . </S>",
    "<S> electronic interactions between planes ( along c ) , which separate in - plane charge modulations through coulomb interaction , can lead to a c - axis chiral modulation of the cdw@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , it has been shown that chiral charge order can also appear in relation to orbital order , which produces transversal polarization introducing phase shifts in the cdw @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the charge modulation observed in 2h - tas@xmath3 can be simulated by assuming that the intensity of the modulations corresponding to each @xmath15 changes as a function of the out - of - plane stacking , or by phase shifting each component @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if we sum up three cdw components with @xmath16**r**)@xmath17**@xmath18 * * * * r**@xmath19 ( with a@xmath20 the amplitude of * @xmath18 * ) , and two different amplitude relationships in two different areas , we obtain the image shown in fig.3a . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , the obtained shapes agree with the experimental image of the cdw ( fig.3b ) .    all these observations , which are similar to those reported in the compound 1t - tise@xmath3@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> demonstrate that 2h - tas@xmath3 has a chiral modulation of its cdw . </S>",
    "<S> note that 2h - tas@xmath3 is a metal which superconducts , but 1t - tise@xmath3 is a semimetal , with no report of superconducting correlations at ambient pressure@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note also that in 1t - tise@xmath3 the cdw modulation is located at two times the lattice constant , whereas in 2h - tas@xmath3 it is located at three times the lattice constant . </S>",
    "<S> the three fold in - plane symmetry with clockwise and counterclockwise domains appearing in the charge order features , are , however , similar . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in 1t - tise@xmath3 , there is a c - axis modulation of the cdw @xcite , with periodicity 2 times the c - axis lattice constant . in 2h - tase@xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , interlayer separation is highest among the 2h series ( it is continuously decreasing from 2h - tase@xmath3 , 2h - tas@xmath3 , 2h - nbse@xmath3 and is smallest in 2h - nbs@xmath3 where no cdw is observed ) the three coexisting cdws lead to a reduction of the crystal symmetry from hexagonal to orthorhombic @xcite . in 2h - nbse@xmath3 , as discussed above , no chiral cdw has been reported , in spite of having been very extensively studied by many different groups . </S>",
    "<S> it could be that 2h - tas@xmath3 lies in between both cases , being sufficiently 2d to present de - coupling of cdw modulations , but not enough to show structural transition or to destroy superconductivity through a too strong destruction of the fermi surface by the cdw gap opening .    </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting tunneling conductance of 2h - tas@xmath3 measured at 100 mk is shown in fig.4 . </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling conductance remains flat until around 0.15 mv , where it starts increasing continuously until 0.4 mv , where the quasiparticle peak is located . </S>",
    "<S> such a feature is found over large parts of the surface , and we could not , until now , observe changes related to the domains of the chiral cdw modulation . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior is instead reminiscent of the compounds 2h - nbse@xmath3 and 2h - nbs@xmath3 , where a distribution of values of the superconducting gap , starting also roughly at half the maximal gap value , is found . in the latter compounds , however , two clear features are seen in the tunneling conductance , which show up as two peaks in the derivative of the corresponding density of states@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these features are due to the two band superconducting properties characteristic of these compounds . here , the derivative of the density of states ( dos , obtained by de - convoluting the temperature , as shown in ref.@xcite ) , shows only one broad peak centered at @xmath2=0.28 mev ( fig.4 ) , which evolves until the t@xmath1=1.75 k following roughly bcs theory . </S>",
    "<S> the value we find for @xmath2 is close to , although somewhat larger , than the value expected within bcs theory , @xmath2=1.76k@xmath21t@xmath1=0.265 mev . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the superconducting gap of 2h - tas@xmath3 has a significant anisotropy , and the two gap features characteristic of 2h - nbse@xmath3 and 2h - nbs@xmath3 are , if they exist at all , less clearly resolved in the superconducting density of states .    </S>",
    "<S> , width=529 ]    our results establish that , in 2h - tas@xmath3 , chiral cdw properties coexist with superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> possible consequences could be related to those found in the context of other superconductors with broken space inversion symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in a superconductor with broken space parity and strong spin orbit coupling ( spin orbit coupling is strong in 2h - tas@xmath3 as discussed in ref.@xcite ) , the two fold electronic spin degeneracy may be lifted , and spin structured cooper pairs could appear @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the form and size of the superconducting gap can be under such conditions peculiar , with nodes along some directions , but it can be also fully opened @xcite . in 2h - tas@xmath3 , the observation of an opened somewhat anisotropic gap , similar to the ones found in related materials , shows that the influence of broken space parity in the superconducting properties is , if present , weak . characterization of superconductivity in the other system of the series , 2h - tase@xmath3@xcite , the observation of the vortex lattice in both compounds , and a closer look to superconductivity in related cdw materials , should bring further advance .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have observed a chiral cdw in a metallic and superconducting compound , 2h - tas@xmath3 , and provide measurements of its superconducting density of states . </S>",
    "<S> we could not establish an influence of broken space parity through a helical electronic structure on the superconducting density of states , but the mere presence of both phenomena in the same material , calls for more work in this and similar compounds .    </S>",
