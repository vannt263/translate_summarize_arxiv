    "one of the most convenient ways to trace magnetic field is related to emission and absorption of polarized radiation by aligned dust .",
    "therefore aligned dust is widely used for this purpose both in diffuse interstellar medium and molecular gas .",
    "moreover , there is evidence of aligned dust around young stellar objects and evolved stars as well as astrophysical environments . at the same time , the processes that aligned dust and their relation to magnetic field are still the subject of debates and require further studies ( see lazarian 2007 for a review ) . while radiative torques ( dolginov & mytrophanov 1976 , draine & weingartner 1996 , 1997 , weingartner & draine 2003 , cho & lazarian 2005 , lazarian & hoang 2007 , hoang & lazarian 2007 ) are currently seen as the most promising candidate mechanism , the variety of astrophysical conditions may enables other mechanisms to dominate in particular environments .",
    "mechanical alignment was pioneered by gold ( 1951 , 1952 ) and then quantified and elaborated by other researchers ( e.g. purcell 1969 , purcell & spitzer 1971 , dolginov & mytrophanov 1976 , lazarian 1994 , 1997 , roberge et al .",
    "while the original mechanism could deal with thermally rotating grains only , two modifications of the mechanism introduced in lazarian ( 1995 ) and elaborated later in lazarian & efroimsky ( 1996 ) , lazarian , efroimsky & ozik ( 1997 ) , efroimsky ( 1999 ) enabled the alignment of grains rotating at much higher rates .",
    "the latter were introduced to the field by purcell ( 1979 ) ( see also lazarian & draine 1999ab , where the limitations on the size for suprathermally rotating grains are discussed ) .",
    "the main shortcoming of the mechanical alignment processes was that they required supersonic gas - dust drift to get any appreciable degree of alignment ( see purcell 1969 ) .",
    "although later studies indicated that such drifts can be produced by ambipolar diffusion ( roberge & hanany 1990 , roberge et al .",
    "1995 ) or interactions of charged grains with mhd turbulence ( lazarian 1994 , lazarian & yan 2002 , yan & lazarian 2002 , yan , lazarian & draine 2004 ) , the degree of alignment that is achievable for the mach number drifts of the order of unity is insufficient to explain observations ( see estimates in lazarian 1997 ) .    the possibility of subsonic flows to mechanically align grains was mentioned in passing in lazarian ( 2007 ) and lazarian & hoang ( 2007 , henceforth lh07 ) , but no relevant calculations were provided there .",
    "this possibility is related to irregular grains demonstrating _ helicity _ , i.e. ability of spin up in a _ regular way _ while interacting with a flow of particles .",
    "in lh07 radiative torques that arise from the interaction of photons with a grain were considered .",
    "similar torques , however , should emerge when atoms bombard the surface of an irregular grain .    in figure",
    "1 we provide a simple model of a helical grain .",
    "the grain consists of an oblate spheroid or an ellipsoid with a mirror attached to it at an angle @xmath0 .",
    "the difference with lh07 is that we assume that the mirror is reflective to atoms rather than photons .    for our purposes in the paper , the actual properties of a spheroid or an ellipsoid do not matter .",
    "those geometric shapes are too symmetric and do not produce torques that can spin up a grain in a regular way , i.e. with angular velocity growing in proportion to time .",
    "the stochastic , i.e. with angular velocity growing as a square root of the time , spin up is the essence of the gold - type alignment processes and it is ignored here , where we deal with subsonic flows . for the sake of simplicity , we assume that the larmor precession of the grain in the external magnetic field is much faster than precession arising from the interaction of the ellipsoidal body with the gaseous flow . as a result ,",
    "following arguments similar to those in lh07 , one can disregard the effects of the gaseous flow on the ellipsoidal body altogether .",
    "thus , the only torques to consider are those arising from the mirror .    as in lh07 ,",
    "the the major role of the ellipsoidal body is to provide a steady rotation about its axis corresponding to the maximal moment of inertia .",
    "this ensures that the model grain is subject to regular torques while it interacts with the gaseous flow .",
    "the difference between the calculations in lh07 and those in the current paper stems from the fact that , while in lh07 the photons are coming as a beam from a single direction , for subsonic flow that we deal with , atoms hit the mirror from all directions characterized by the flux of atoms given by equation ( [ ap2 ] ) .",
    "this induces averaging of the torques that we implement below .",
    "consider a helical grain ( see fig .",
    "[ f0 ] ) drifting across a gas chamber with a velocity @xmath1 along the @xmath2 axis .",
    "the velocity of an atom with respect to the grain is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the thermal velocity of the atom . the torque from the perfect reflecting of atoms on a surface area @xmath5 of the mirror is given by @xmath6 a f({\\bf s}-{\\bf s}_{d } ) d^{3 } s,\\label{ap1}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , vectors @xmath8 is the radius vector directed from the spheroid to the mirror",
    ", @xmath9 and @xmath5 is the surface area of the mirror , and @xmath10 is the flux of incoming atoms that can collide with the grain .",
    "angular momentum element @xmath11 is antiparallel to the normal vector and given by @xmath12 where @xmath13",
    ". here @xmath14 are radius and normal vector which are functions of angles @xmath15 describing the orientation of the grain in the lab system defined by @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( see fig .",

    "equation ( [ eq8 ] ) can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the vector torque efficiency consisting of components @xmath27 and @xmath28 on axes @xmath29 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "two first components for subsonic and supersonic cases are shown in figure  [ f1 ] . the third component produced by the mirror",
    "is found to be zero .",
    "it is clear that the component @xmath28 is responsible for the precession ( lh07 ) .",
    "this component is non - zero for a spheroidal body of the grain .",
    "in fact , as we discussed above , we disregard this component , as it does not induce either alignment or spin up .    in figure [ f1 ]",
    "we show torque components for subsonic case @xmath30 and a supersonic case @xmath31 .",
    "it can be seen that the component @xmath32 has zero points at @xmath33 and @xmath34 in both subsonic and supersonic case .",
    "the component @xmath35 is very symmetric in the latter .",
    "however , the torques are distorted due to the thermal collisions of gaseous atoms in the former case .",
    "the essential properties ( i.e. symmetry of @xmath35 and zero points of @xmath32 ) of mechanical torques which are similar to those of radiative torques indicate that mechanical torques can align grains in the same ways as radiative torques do , i.e. , grains tend to aligned with long axes perpendicular to magnetic fields .",
    "we study this problem in the section below .",
    "when the larmor precession of a grain is larger than the precession induced by mechanical torques ( see  11.6 in lh07 ) , the alignment occurs with respect to magnetic field ( either @xmath36 or @xmath37 ) which defines the axis of alignment . to study the grain alignment induced by mechanical torques , similar to lh07 , we solve the equations of motion for angular momentum @xmath38 in time t : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is given by equation ( [ eq8 ] ) and @xmath41 is the gaseous damping time . for simplicity , we assume a perfect internal alignment ; i.e. the axis of major inertia @xmath42 is always parallel to @xmath38 ( dw97 ; lh07 ) .",
    "we consider a model grain drifting across magnetic field by an angle @xmath43 acted upon by a subsonic flow with @xmath44 .",
    "representing equation ( [ eq10 ] ) in the spherical coordinate system defined by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the magnitude of @xmath38 , @xmath47 is the angle between @xmath38 and @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the larmor precession angle , we get three equations for @xmath50 and @xmath49 ( see sec . 7 in lh07 ) . averaging over @xmath49 from @xmath51 to @xmath52",
    ", we obtain only equations for @xmath53 and @xmath47 .",
    "we construct trajectory map based on the obtained solution @xmath54 .",
    "figure [ f2 ] shows the obtained trajectory map with initial condition @xmath55 and the angle @xmath47 generated from a uniform distribution .",
    "we see that grain phase trajectories that start at different angles @xmath47 converge on either high-@xmath46 attractor points a and b corresponding to perfect alignment , or a low-@xmath46 attractor point c. the latter point formally corresponds to @xmath56 .",
    "however , as it was explained in lh07 and shown by numerical simulations in hoang & lazarian ( 2007 ) , this is an artifact of our ignoring thermal fluctuations within the grain .",
    "if those are taken into account the low-@xmath46 attractor points correspond to the angular momentum of the order of the thermal angular momentum corresponding to the temperature of the grain body ( see also weingartner & draine 2003 , hoang & lazarian 2007 ) .",
    "what should be noted is that the attractor points for @xmath44 correspond to the alignment of @xmath42 parallel to @xmath48 ; i.e. the grain gets aligned with long axes perpendicular to magnetic field .",
    "this is similar to what the davis - greenstein ( 1951 ) mechanism of paramagnetic relaxation predicts , but the process we discuss here does not invoke paramagnetic relaxation .",
    "gaseous bombardment randomizes grain phase trajectories .",
    "however , rather than tracing phase trajectories , it is practically convenient to have a criterion for the efficiency of grain alignment .",
    "the maximal rotational velocity of grains induced by torques can be used for this purpose .",
    "a study in hoang & lazarian ( 2007 ) which solves the lagevin equation in order to account for gaseous bombardment shows that this velocity which us a function of @xmath57 should be approximately 3 times larger than the thermal rotational velocity of the grain .    for practical calculations of the rotational velocity",
    "we assume that 10% of the atoms impinging on the grain mirror are reflected .",
    "figure [ f3 ] shows the angular velocity of a grain as a function of the mach number of the flow .",
    "the horizontal line corresponds to @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "it is clear from looking at figure [ f3 ] that for our model , helical grains get aligned for relatively low velocities of gas - grain drift .",
    "all the earlier mechanisms of mechanical alignment are inefficient for such low subsonic velocities .",
    "indeed , drifting velocities of the order of @xmath60 of sound speed should be quite common in the ism ( see yan , lazarian & draine 2004 ) , so potentially the mechanism is widely applicable .",
    "however , it requires further studies .",
    "one may wonder whether the condition of perfect reflection is absolutely necessary .",
    "it can be shown that the torques are changed by a factor of unity if impinging atoms are absorbed on the grain surface , thermalized there , and emitted from the point that they hit the surface . moreover , for regular torques to act on a helical grain , it is sufficient to have a correlation of the place that the atom impinges on the grain surface and is evaporated from it .",
    "it is only when there is no correlation at all , that our model grain does not experience _ regular _ torques .",
    "therefore we believe that we do not overestimate the torques with our assumption of 10% reflection . in general , to characterize the interaction of grain surface with the gaseous flow , one can introduce a `` reflection efficiency factor '' @xmath61 .",
    "a different issue is the degree of helicity of an irregular grain .",
    "naturally , most of the grains do not have facets , but have numerous irregularities .",
    "an idealized model grain ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , for which the damping arising from the gas interactions with the ellipsoidal body tends to zero , has the maximal possible value of the torques @xmath62 for a given grain size @xmath63 and the mach number @xmath64 and its `` helicity reduction factor '' @xmath65 .",
    "this factor , in a general case , can be characterized by @xmath66 .",
    "further numerical studies should clarify the value of @xmath67 for actual irregular grains . in figure [ f3 ]",
    "we show results for different @xmath68 factors .",
    "in our letter we use the same toy model of a helical grain as in lh07 . in lh07",
    "we proved the validity of the model ( which uses a geometric optics approximation ) comparing the functional dependencies of model s torques and those numerically calculated for the actual irregular grains . in comparison ,",
    "the justification of the model for the gaseous bombardment is self - evident .",
    "however , the combination @xmath68 presents a combined uncertainty factor , which characterizes both the uncertainties in grain - gas interactions and grain shape .",
    "testing of the former requires laboratory studies , while the latter can be established via the numerical research .    what is the relative role of traditional mechanisms of mechanical alignment ?",
    "those mechanisms require supersonic motions to be efficient .",
    "it is only mechanical alignment of helical grains that allows alignment for the subsonic motions .",
    "thus we may claim that mechanical alignment of helical grains constitutes a new class of mechanical alignment processes .",
    "in fact , the difference between the mechanical alignment of helical grains and the gold mechanism of grain alignment is similar to the difference between the radiative torque alignment and the harwit ( 1970 ) process .",
    "the latter appeals to stochastic torques arising from absorption of photons from a light beam and was shown by purcell & spitzer ( 1971 ) to be inefficient for most interstellar situations .",
    "similarly , as the radiative torque alignment is more efficient than the harwit ( 1970 ) alignment , we believe that the mechanical of helical grains is more efficient than the gold processes . therefore , at supersonic velocities we expect the mechanical alignment of the actual irregular grains to be governed by their helicity , rather than the degree of their oblateness of prolateness , which is the case for the gold mechanisms .",
    "the consequence of this is that the mechanical alignment of grains will happen with long grain axes perpendicular to magnetic field irrespective on the gas - grain velocities .",
    "this is in contrast to the gold alignment , for which the change of alignment happens at the van vleck angle @xmath69 .",
    "in hoang & lazarian ( 2007 ) , the effects of gaseous bombardment and uncompensated purcell s torques ( purcell 1979 ) , e.g. h@xmath70 torques , was studied in connection with the alignment of helical grains subjected to radiative torques .",
    "that study shows that , in the case when both high-@xmath46 and low-@xmath46 attractor points coexist , gaseous bombardment transfers grains from low-@xmath46 to high-@xmath46 thus increasing attractor points compared to the low-@xmath46 ones . ] , counter - intuitively , the degree of alignment .",
    "this is surely true only if @xmath71 is sufficiently high , e.g. higher than @xmath72 .",
    "the purcell torques , do not change @xmath46 in the low-@xmath46 attractor points because grains flip fast at those points causing thermal trapping , as discussed in lazarian & draine ( 1999a ) .",
    "they , however , can increase the values of @xmath46 at high-@xmath46 attractor points . for most situations , this does not affect the degree of alignment .",
    "our considerations above deal with ordinary paramagnetic grains . for those",
    ", the influence of paramagnetic torques is mostly negligible for the typical ism conditions .",
    "the situation changes if grains are superparamagnetic ( see jones & spitzer 1967 ) .",
    "in this situation one can expect always to have alignment with high-@xmath46 attractor points , thus having degree of alignment close to 100% .",
    "the assumption of the presence of superparamagnetic inclusions is an extra assumption , however .    as we have stressed above , the mechanical alignment we discuss here and the radiative torque alignment are different incarnations of the alignment of helical grains .",
    "while the radiative torques have attracted a lot of attention recently , the mechanical alignment of helical grains has only be mentioned in a couple of publications ( lazarian 1995 , 2007 , lazarian et al .",
    "1997 , lh07 ) . the relative role of the mechanisms depends on the yet uncertain factor @xmath68 for the mechanical processes .",
    "the observations tends to be in agreement with the radiative torque predictions ( see lazarian 2007 and ref .",
    "therein ) .",
    "it is encouraging that both mechanisms predict the alignment with long grain axes perpendicular to magnetic field .",
    "therefore one may hope that the subsonic alignment of helical grains can reveal via polarimetry the magnetic fields in the situations when the radiative torques fail .",
    "the variety of astrophysical circumstances ensures that there are situations when grains are aligned by mechanical subsonic flows .",
    "note that aligned grains were reported not only for the ism , but also comets and circumstellar regions .",
    "they are also likely to be present in the disks around evolved and young stars .",
    "the goal of this letter above is to attract the attention of the community to the possibility of mechanical alignment of helical dust grains . while further studies of the process are necessary , the following points can be made at this moment :                    1952 , mnras , 112 , 215 harwit , m. 1970 , nature , 226 , 61 - 63 hoang , t. , & lazarian , a. 2007 , mnras , in press ( astro - ph/0707.3645 ) jones , j.v . ,",
