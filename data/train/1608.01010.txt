    "a _ classical _ rising factorial expansion ( factorial series ) as @xmath2 is a series of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is known as the pochhammer symbol , or rising factorial .",

    "excellent introductions to the classical theory of factorial series and their application to solving odes can be found in the books by nrlund and wasow @xcite ; see also @xcite ch.4 .",

    "recent use of factorial expansions to tackle divergent perturbation series in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) triggered considerable renewed interest and substantial literature .",
    "an excellent account of new developments is @xcite ; see also @xcite and references therein .",
    "most often , the classical factorial expansions arising in odes and physics have two major limitations : ( 1 ) slow convergence , at best power - like ; ( 2 ) a limited ( for the function , unnaturally ) domain of convergence : a half plane which can not be centered on the asymptotically important stokes ray ; is a direction in the borel @xmath9 plane along which its borel ( i.e. formal inverse laplace ) transform @xmath10 has singularities .",
    "if @xmath11 is a singularity of @xmath10 then the ray in the @xmath12 plane @xmath13 is sometimes also called a stokes ray , and it is the direction where a small exponential is collected in the transseries of @xmath14 .",

    "one aim of the present work is to address and overcome these limitations .      for clarity of presentation , we start with examples . in  [ eistokes ] we first find a geometrically convergent `` dyadic '' factorial expansion for ei in @xmath15 , a region containing the stokes ray . in  [ s3 ] we establish a dyadic decomposition of the cauchy kernel which we then use in  [ eiaway ] to obtain a somewhat simpler and more efficient expansion of ei in @xmath16 . in  [ bessel ]",
    "we make a first step towards generalization and obtain dyadic factorial expansions for airy and bessel functions .",
    "further examples and useful identities are given in ",
    "[ gamma ] .    in  [ resfun ] we develop the general theory of constructing geometrically convergent dyadic expansions for typical calle resurgent functions .",

    "footnote 1 ) , such series are also resummable in terms of dyadic expansions .",
    "our theory extends naturally to transseriable functions , but we do not pursue this in the present paper .",
