    "it is likely that a significant fraction of all solar - type stars formed in molecular clouds in the vicinity of massive luminous stars ( eg hester & desch , 2005 ) .",
    "an understanding of the interaction between ob stars and their molecular gas environment is therefore necessary in order to understand star formation .",
    "such interaction has been the subject of considerable theoretical study ( eg bertoldi & mckee , 1990 ) , and hydrodynamic models show that complex dynamic structures are formed in such environments ( eg lefloch & lazareff , 1994 ) .",
    "but the effects of ob stars on the formation of new lower - mass stars remains unclear : both modest enhancements ( eg dale et al .",
    ", 2007 ) and supression of the star formation rate ( eg mckee , 1989 ) have been suggested . over the complete lifespan of a giant molecular cloud however ,",
    "the presence of ob stars does limit the star formation efficiency , due to the eventual dispersal of the molecular gas by ionising stellar photons and winds ( eg mckee & ostriker , 2007 ) .",
    "the interaction between ob stars and gmcs have clear observational signatures , including ionisation fronts , photon dominated regions ( pdrs ) , bright - rimmed clouds , dark clumps and cometary globules ( eg hester et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "however , optical and infrared observations of dark clouds and globules reveal only part of the picture ; they show neither the internal structure nor the dynamics of the absorbing clouds , and they can only be seen in the foreground of diffuse emission nebulae .",
    "the rosette nebula , by dint of its overall symmetry and simple optical morphology , has long been regarded as a textbook example of the interaction between ob stars and surrounding gas .",

    "is the well - known symmetrical optical emission nebula . to",
    "the southeast lies a large molecular cloud complex , known as the rosette molecular cloud ( hereafter `` rmc '' ) , of total mass @xmath11 , and extent @xmath740pc ( eg williams et al . , 1995 - w95 ) . near the centre of the rmc",
    "lies the luminous embedded star afgl961 , well studied because of its bright infrared spectra and outflow signatures ( eg lada & gautier , 1982 ) .",
    "the rmc itself has been mapped in the j=1 - 0 transitions of @xmath0co and @xmath12co , with spatial resolutions of 8  arcmin ( blitz & thaddeus , 1980 ) , 1.7  arcmin ( blitz & stark , 1986 ) and 45  arcsec ( heyer et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "more detailed studies have also been undertaken of individual objects within the rmc ( eg patel et al .",
    ", 1993 ; schneider et al . ,",
    "1998 ) .    in the present work",
    "we describe new large - scale observations of the rosette nebula and the surrounding region obtained with high spatial resolution ( 14  arcsec ) in the j=3 - 2 transition of @xmath0co .",
    "this transition has an upper energy level of 33k and critical density of @xmath13 , as compared to 13k and @xmath14 for the 1 - 0 transition , and so are sensitive to relatively compact , warm clumps of dense gas .",
    "we use the data to take a census of outflows within the rmc ( section 3.1 ) , look at the overall spatial and velocity structure of the gas ( 3.2 ) , and investigate the compact clumps ( 3.3 ) .",
    "we compare the results with published co  10 data as well as observations of embedded young stars , in order to determine the effects of the rosette o - stars on the surrounding gmc .",
    "we have adopted a distance of 1400  pc for the rosette nebula ( hensberge et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "the observations described in this paper were carried out using the newly - commissioned heterodyne receiver array installed on the james clerk maxwell telescope , mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the system consists of harp , the 16-element frontend receiver ( smith et al . , 2003 ) , and acsis , the backend correlator and data reduction system ( hovey et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "controlling these instruments , as well as the telescope , is a hardware realtime sequencer , as well as a high - level software control system , known as the ocs ( rees et al . , 2002 ) .",

    "( 2008 ) .",
    "the large datacubes in the present observations were obtained using the fast raster - scan observing mode of acsis / harp .",
    "the telescope was scanned at 75  arcsec / second with a 10  hz sampling rate , providing 7.5  arcsec sampling in the scan direction .",
    "the orientation of the regular square array of the harp frontend was maintained at @xmath15 to the scan direction using a mechanical beam rotator ; with the diffraction - limited beam size of 14  arcsec and the harp beam separation of 30  arcsec , this resulted in near nyquist - sampled data .",
    "the chosen sampling was found to provide a good compromise between wide area coverage and near nyquist sampling of the sky .",
    "the final image was constructed from several map scans , typically @xmath16 or @xmath17 in extent , each requiring 30 - 60 minutes to complete ( including pointing and observations of a spectral line standard ) . in most of the mapped region ,",
    "a basket - weaving technique was employed , where the same area of sky was scanned in orthogonal directions ( ra and decl . , j2000 ) .",
    "to improve the signal to noise ratio , a second pair of orthogonal scans were made in some regions of the map . during most of the observations ,",
    "two of the mixers were unusable and were flagged out during data reduction .",
    "the basket - weaving observing technique significantly improved the fidelity of the final images in such circumstances , by providing relatively even sky coverage , better redundancy , and reduced scanning artifacts .",
    "a common reference observation was taken every 60 - 100 seconds , at the end of every one or two rows .",
    "the line - free reference position used was @xmath18 ( j2000 ; these are the coordinates of the array centre ) .",
    "a total of 20 hours of observations were taken in 2006 dec  9 and 15 and 2007 feb 14 and 15 , including calibration and pointing .",
    "system temperatures were mostly in the range 180 - 320k ( ssb ) during the runs ( although one scan was done at low elevation , resulting in system temperatures as high as 450k ) .",
    "main beam efficiency was determined to be 0.55@xmath19 , as measured on jupiter ( size 30  arcsec ) and the jcmt spectral line standard ngc2071ir",
    ". measurements on the full moon showed maximum mixer - to - mixer calibration differences of about 5% ( hills et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "the pointing errors of the telescope at the time of these observations were higher than normal , at 3  arcsec rms , as measured from observations of the nearby source ngc2071 .",
    "however , the largest variation measured at the start and end of an individual raster map was 7  arcsec , significantly less than the beam size ( 14  arcsec ) , and hence these errors should not significantly affect the final map .    the @xmath0co j=3 - 2 line was observed in the lower sideband , at a rest frequency of 345.796ghz .",
    "acsis was set up in a configuration with a total of 1.0  ghz bandwidth per mixer ; with 2048 spectral channels per if and natural weighting of the correlation function this resulted in an effective spectral resolution of 0.45@xmath20 .",
    "the data were reduced and calibrated in real time using the acsis reduction software , which produces a time- and coordinate - stamped series of spectra . the starlink smurf package ( jenness et al . , 2008 )",
    "was used to transform these data into spectral cubes , using a 7.5  arcsec grid spacing and assigning each data sample to its  nearest neighbour in the final cube . the starlink kappa and ccdpack routines were used to remove a linear baseline from each spectrum ,",
    "transform to the same regular coordinate grid , and combine the maps into a single output data cube . to limit the final datacube size , only the central 66 spectral channels ( from @xmath21 to @xmath22 ) were included .",
    "individual spectra in the unsmoothed datacube had noise levels ranging from 0.9 - 3.6  k ( t@xmath23 , rms ) . moreover , because of the missing mixers , a small number of pixels in this datacube were not filled . to improve the fidelity of the images , the data were smoothed in the spatial dimensions by a gaussian of width ( fwhm ) 15  arcsec , resulting in an effective image spatial resolution of 20  arcsec .",
    "the spectral rms noise per pixel in the final smoothed datacube then ranged from 0.2 - 0.5  k , with a mean value of 0.3  k ( t@xmath23 ) .",
    "the final map , of size @xmath24 , contained @xmath25 spectra .",
    "= 14.0 cm    an image of the peak co j=32 emission , illustrating the overall structure of the warm molecular gas in the region , is displayed in figure  1 .",
    "also shown are the locations of the o stars illuminating the rosette optical nebula ; the size of the symbols represents the uv excitation parameters of these stars ( proportional to the radii of their strmgren spheres - celnik , 1985 ) .",
    "this figure illustrates the lack of molecular gas in the central region around the most luminous o stars . the rosette molecular cloud , previously mapped at lower angular resolution in the co  10 transition ( blitz & stark , 1986 ; heyer et al . , 2006 ) and",
    "( in part ) in the 32 transition ( schneider et al . , 1998 ) , appears as the relatively bright complex structure to the se of the o - star cluster , extending over about @xmath26 ( 20pc ) . in the area of overlap , the new data agree reasonably well with the lower - resolution large - scale images of heyer et al .",
    "however , the factor of @xmath27 higher resolution and the higher energy level of the j=32 co transition reveals more clearly the complex small - scale structures in the warm gas throughout the cloud . in particular , many compact clumps are clearly seen surrounding the ob cluster and , by studying the full datacube ,",
    "several high - velocity outflows are found in the region ( see sections below ) .",
    "peak _ brightness temperature shown in fig .  1 emphasises the multiple compact ( as well as some more extended ) clouds with narrow , bright emission lines .",
    "the image also shows that many of the clumps and clouds are limb - brightening on their edge facing the o stars .    by consideration of the full datacube ,",
    "we identify three distinct spatio - velocity structures : ( 1 ) relatively compact regions with broad line wings , identified as compact or well - collimated high - velocity flows , frequently associated with bright iras sources ; ( 2 ) bright , compact clumps of emission , of sizes up to @xmath73 arcmin ( @xmath71pc ) , many of which have significant velocity gradients ; and ( 3 ) extensive undifferentiated regions of emission with narrow linewidths .",
    "the latter extended components were identified as ambient , relatively - undisturbed cool gas clouds in the region ( heyer et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "in the following sections we investigate the first two types of compact structures in more detail .      inspection of the full datacube reveal seven potential high - velocity ( hv ) protostellar outflows in the region ; their locations and identifications are marked by squares on figure  1 .",
    "such flows are identified in several ways .",
    "firstly their line profiles show broad wings of emission extending @xmath28 from the core cloud velocity , with a gradual decrease of intensity to higher relative velocities .",
    "this is substantially different in character from the discrete , narrow velocity components that would arise from clumps of ambient gas along the line - of - sight . as noted by borkin et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , inspection of full position - velocity datacubes can rapidly reveal these regions of hv gas in complex regions .",
    "a confirmation of the hv outflow nature comes from the j=32 to j=10 line ratio in the wings . in all cases ,",
    "this is significantly higher than the line core , implying that the hv gas is relatively warm .",
    "finally , the regions of hv gas are spatially relatively compact , no larger than a few arcminutes , which is unlikely for multiple line - of - sight clumps .",
    "table  1 gives the characteristics of these regions of hv gas , and the co j=32 spectral profiles at the central positions of the outflows are shown in figure  2 .",
    "we also include in fig .",
    "2 the co j=10 profiles for comparison , using data taken by heyer et al . ( 2006 ) .",
    "the j=32 data have been smoothed to the same spatial resolution as that of the lower transition ( 45  arcsec ) and both lines are shown on the main - beam brightness temperature scale , t@xmath23 . in all cases , the line ratio in the wings lies in the range 1.5  3 , indicating excitation temperatures of 40 - 60  k , assuming optically thin gas in lte ( cf figure  12 below ) . to illustrate the spatio - velocity structure in the outflows , figures 3 and 4",
    "show position - velocity cuts through the objects .",
    "these reveal the notable differences in characteristics of the ambient clumpy gas ( often extended in the spatial direction , but compact in the spectral dimension ) , and the outflow gas ( spatially - compact , but with high - velocity wings ) . further searches through the datacube revealed no other regions with similar characteristics , although it is possible that some are hidden by multiple narrow line components along some lines of sight .",
    "blitz & stark ( 1986 ) proposed that broad co emission from the rmc may be caused by high - velocity interclump gas .",
    "conversely , schneider et al .",
    "( 1996 ) suggested that some of the apparent hv emission is actually due to the superposition of multiple line - of - sight clumps .",
    "the higher spatial resolution of the present data supports their origin in hv outflows , at least for the seven objects noted above . in section 3.2 , we discuss more the velocity extent of the compact clumps .",

    "the others are new flows .",
    "notably there is a close correspondence between this list of outflows and the list of embedded young clusters found by phelps & lada ( 1997 ) : the only co outflow not associated with a nearby cluster ( rof5 ) lies outside their survey area ( although inspection of the 2mass k - band images around rof5 showed no bright nearby cluster ) .",
    "conversely , of the 7 embedded clusters identified by phelps & lada , only one ( pl5 ) has no apparent associated outflow .",
    "phelps & lada also identified 10 iras sources in the region without an associated cluster ; none of these have evidence of outflows in our survey .",
    "moreover , by inspection of the datacube in position - velocity space , we find no evidence of hv gas in other regions around the rosette nebula ( see figure  1 ) . in summary ,",
    "massive high - velocity molecular outflows such as those listed in table  1 are closely associated with young clusters containing luminous iras objects .",
    "iras objects without associated clusters do not show signs of hv outflows . in the following sections we discuss some of these flows , first individually , and then in the global context of the rosette nebula .",
    "this was one of the first bright outflows to be discovered ( eg lada & gautier , 1982 ) , and published maps of the central region in @xmath0co lines indicated that the flow direction lies close to the plane of the sky ( eg schneider et al . , 1998 ) .",

    "however , this inclination is likely to be @xmath39 , as the more extended red and blue - shifted lobes both show similar morphologies .",
    "comparison with infrared images of h@xmath35 v=1 - 0 s(1 ) emission from aspin ( 1998 ) shows that the tip of the ne lobe is concident with the most distant clump of shocked h@xmath35 ( ca6 ) , suggesting this is the bow shock at the end of the outflow jet .    both the spectrum towards afgl961 ( fig .  2 ) and position - velocity diagrams ( fig .",
    "4 ) show a prominent and narrow self - absorption dip near the rmc systemic velocity .",
    "this dip appears spatially extended ( over at least @xmath74 arcmin in fig .",
    "4 ) , implying it is due to absorption in a large cool cloud along the line - of - sight , rather than in a compact outer envelope around afgl961 itself .",
    "in addition to the ne - sw flow , the integrated co maps ( fig .",
    "5 ) show high - velocity gas in regions extending orthogonal to the main flow axis .",
    "it can be seen as hv emission extending to @xmath403  arcmin in the position - velocity cut of fig .",
    "if a separate flow , the origin appears to lie approximately 1  arcmin sw of afgl961 .",
    "this weaker flow appears to be bipolar , with blue and red - shifted gas dominating the nw and se sides respectively , suggesting that the flow axis lies out of the plane of the sky .",
    "infrared images of the region show shocked gas is also found in several other directions in addition to the dominant co axis ( aspin , 1998 ) .",

    "maclow & klessen ( 2004 ) and others have suggested that gas turbulence within a gmc has a strong effect on the efficiency of star formation .",
    "moreover , it has been proposed that protostellar outflows , such as those described above , could provide a significant contribution to this turbulence .",
    "consequently it is important to assess the global effects of all outflows within a gmc .",
    "the current dataset provides a census of hv outflows over a gmc of size @xmath43  pc , which is complete down to an outflow mass of @xmath44 .",
    "this potentially allows us to assess the global effect of such flows on the rmc .",
    "maclow & klessen note that , in most cases , the sizes of outflows are generally too small to be important within a gmc .",
    "the relatively compact nature of the outflows in the rmc confirms this .",
    "even the largest - afgl961 - is only 2pc across , or less than 5% of the size of the rmc . within the individual young clusters , however , the outflows have a similar extent to that of the cluster itself , and their effect may be more significant . we can estimate the importance of the flows by comparing their kinetic energy , ( @xmath45 in table  1 ) with the turbulent kinetic energy of the associated large , dense molecular clumps ( @xmath46 ) . assuming the linewidth @xmath47 is from turbulent broadening , then ke@xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the total clump mass in units of @xmath50 ; values of @xmath51 are listed in table  1 .",
    "using published clump masses from the @xmath12co j=1 - 0 observations of w95 , the outflow kinetic energy in table  1 is 1 - 30% of the clump turbulent energy . after allowing for an underestimate of the outflowing mass by a factor of @xmath52 to account for inclinations and optical depths ( eg beuther et al .",
    ", 2002 - see above ) , then the outflow kinetic energy is similar to the turbulent energy within the dense gas clumps . on a larger scale , however , the main part of the rmc has mass and velocity width of @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( w95 ) , giving @xmath55 ; this compares with the @xmath56 from all the outflows ( after including the correction factor described above ) . therefore , although the outflows may be energetically significant on a stellar cluster scale , their effects are negligible on the tens of pc scale of the whole rmc .",
    "the molecular gas in the vicinity of the rosette nebula shows a complex velocity structure , illustrated in the colour - coded image in figure  7 . here",
    ", we show integrated emission from gas which is blue and red - shifted with respect to the rmc systemic velocity , and ( in green ) the emission from gas around the ambient cloud velocity . on the largest scale ( tens of pc ) , the data shows a velocity gradient from nw - se of @xmath57 , similar to that noted by w95 .",
    "the distant gas is distributed relatively smoothly , both spatially and in velocity .",
    "however , this gradient is clearly highly disrupted towards the central rosette nebula , where many compact clumps and clouds at different radial velocities are superposed along the line - of - sight .",
    "some distinct features are apparent in the velocity - coded image which help in understanding the overall dynamics of the system .",
    "examples are the nw ridge - a line of blue - shifted clumps seen most clearly @xmath58  pc nw of the centre ( along the nw of the ellipse in fig .  7 ) , and the monoceros ridge - the abrupt edge of the se molecular cloud @xmath58  pc se of the centre ( seen along the se of the ellipse ) .",
    "these distinct features are described in the following sections .",
    "= 12.0 cm    the nw ridge is a line of compact blue - shifted clumps to the nw of the central o stars .",
    "these molecular clumps are all associated with dark absorbing globules and elephant trunks in the optical images ( see section 3.3 , figure  9 ) .",
    "their high optical obscuration and blue - shifted profiles indicates they are on the nearside of the nebula , moving towards us ( with respect to the systemic cloud velocity ) .",
    "moreover there is a clear velocity gradient along the ridge ; evidence of this can be seen in the colour - coded image in figure  9 . in order to help understand these data ,",
    "we have fitted the positions , velocities and velocity gradients of the emission clumps using simple 3d gaussians ( see section 3.3.2 ) . using the centroid velocities of these fitted clumps",
    ", we investigate the velocity structure along the inner rim of molecular gas around the rosette nebula ( to a projected radius of @xmath59 from the centre of the nebula , and a depth of 3.5pc ( 9 arcmin ) from the inner edge of the rim ) .",
    "figure  8 shows the velocity of these clumps as a function of @xmath60 , the azimuthal angle around the rim .",
    "the velocity structure of much of the nw blue - shifted ridge ( at @xmath61 ) can be most easily fit with that of an expanding ring of radius 11pc , inclined at 30@xmath62 , with an expansion velocity of 30@xmath20 and a mean velocity of @xmath63 .",
    "this is illustrated by the ellipse in figure  7 .",
    "evidence of gas clumps fitting such a ring can be seen in regions of @xmath60 up to 180 . around the se rim ( @xmath64 )",
    "there are few corresponding red - shifted clumps as predicted by the simple expanding ring model .",
    "most emission here lies within @xmath65 of the rmc systemic velocity , suggesting this material is not participating in the ring expansion .",
    "nevertheless , the structure and velocity gradients across the se cloud rim clearly indicate that this cloud is exposed to the o star radiation field ; this suggests that expansion on this side may have been confined by the ambient cloud .",
    "the conditions of this cloud rim will be described further in section 3.3.2 .",
    "some additional blue - shifted emission is apparent on the e rim , at @xmath66 in figure  7 and 8 , and this corresponds to an optically - dark obscuring cloud ( eg gahm et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "notably , _ all _ of the dark clouds in the region of the rosette nebula - which are presumed to be in the foreground of the nebula - appear to be blue - shifted with respect to the cloud systemic velocity .",
    "this strongly suggests that all these foreground clouds are expanding away from the nebula towards us , and that most ( but not all ) of this expansion is in the form of a ring of material .",

    ", the plot shows that line ratios and derived clump temperatures are consistent with radiative heating by the central stars .",
    "as noted above , it is likely this is the clump surface temperature ; internal clump temperatures are not accessible to the @xmath0co lines because of high optical depths , and their determination would require measurements using less abundant isotopologues .      the sharply - delineated se rim , known as the monoceros ridge , is a clear example of the interface between o  star radiation field and a molecular cloud ( blitz & thaddeus , 1980 ; schneider et al . , 1998 ) . as noted by schneider et al .",

    "they also noted that it is composed of several discrete components in position - velocity space . in figure  13",
    "we show a colour - coded image of the j=3 - 2 line in this region , as well as the edge of the cloud to the s of the central cavity ( the s rim ) . along",
    "both se and s rims , the molecular cloud has a sharply - defined bright edge , spatially unresolved on one side .",
    "this indicates that the edge facing the o stars is @xmath13115  arcsec ( or 0.1pc ) across , ie it is likely to be a thin structure viewed almost edge - on . in the lower - resolution j=1 - 0 images ( heyer et al . , 2006 ) , the limb - brightening is less clear , and the j=3 - 2/1 - 0 line ratio ( after convolving the 3 - 2 data to the same resolution ) shows a peak at the bright edge of 1.1 , dropping gradually into the molecular cloud to @xmath132 .",
    "this suggests that the limb brightening of the j=3 - 2 line is due to a temperature peak at the cloud edge of 30k ( averaged over a 45  arcsec beam ) , dropping to @xmath720k in the cloud core ( cf figure  12 ) .",
    "= 8.0 cm    in addition to the sharp - edged structure , the se - s cloud rims show a velocity gradient , with @xmath133 .",
    "this is mostly orthogonal to the edge , and can be seen in the colour - coded image in fig .  13 , where the rim facing the o stars is blue - shifted , and the emission becomes more red - shifted deeper into the rmc .",
    "the gradient is of similar magnitude but opposite sign to that seen across the nw clumps ( table  2 ) , suggesting that the rims lie on the far side of the nebula , and that gas is being accelerating away from us .",
    "this relative location along the line - of - sight is confirmed by the absence of corresponding dark absorbing clouds in optical images , and contrasts with the nw side , where every blue - shifted co clump has a clear corresponding dark cloud ( cf figure  9 ) .",
    "the bulk molecular gas velocity of the se rim gas is @xmath134 , similar to that of the nebula and rmc itself .",
    "note that this is the projected velocity ; the true velocity may be higher if acceleration has occurred mostly in the plane of the sky ( for example , if it is being viewed edge - on ) .",
    "in addition to a velocity shift , the datacube also shows an increase in linewidth across the se rim , from @xmath135 at the blue - shifted edge , to @xmath136 towards the molecular cloud core .",
    "although in some regions this broadening may be due to multiple clumps at different velocities along the line of sight ( eg schneider et al . , 1998 ) , the general trend throughout the rims is that the clump gas velocities are more dispersed further into the cloud .",
    "both the se - s molecular rims and the nw ridge ( see above ) are at a similar separation from the o stars , and are presumably experiencing a similar photoionisation flux .",
    "other physical characteristics ( co linewidth , velocity gradient , temperature ) are similar in both the se - s molecular rims , and the nw clumps .",
    "however these regions clearly have different morphologies , with small filling - factor clumps elongated in the radial direction in the nw ( fig .",
    "9 ) , and a large filling - factor molecular rim orientated tangentially in the se - s ( fig .  13 ) .",
    "the reason for this difference is likely due to the different molecular gas densities in these two directions .",
    "as the gas in the rmc to the se disperses , the contiguous rim is likely to evolve into a series of more dispersed isolated clumps , similar to that currently found in the nw .",
    "the images of co and optical emission ( figures  1 , 7 & 9 ) show that much of the gas within 25  pc of the rosette nebula appears highly clumped over a wide range of size scales ; several authors have also noted that the rmc contains a large number of compact , low - mass clumps .",
    "molecular observations of the bright se section of the rmc have been used to estimate the clump mass distribution in this region ( w95 , schneider et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "however , the large area coverage and simultaneous high spatial resolution of the present dataset potentially allows us to measure the clump mass distribution over a relatively large dynamic range , and to search for differences in the clump mass distribution over the cloud . to identify individual clumps ,",
    "we have employed the starlink cupid package ( berry et al . , 2007 ) , with the 3-d gaussian fitting algorithm , based on stutzki & gsten ( 1990 ) .",
    "this allows a direct comparison with similar analysis of other gmcs ( eg kramer et al . , 1998 , and refs . therein ) . to minimise the ambiguity of clump identification and increase the robustness of the results , we set rather conservative lower limits to the peak brightness temperature ( 5.5k , @xmath79 ) , clump size ( 20  arcsec ) , and linewidth ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "this technique identified 2050 clumps with these limits over the complete area shown in fig .  1 .    reconstructing a model datacube with the identified clumps generates @xmath138 of the _ compact _ emission flux ( @xmath139  arcmin across ) .",
    "however , very little of the large - scale emission ( @xmath140  arcmin ) from the extended smooth clouds is picked up using this technique , and only 2@xmath141 of the identified clumps have sizes larger than 5 beamwidths , as the gaussian clump - fitting method tends to subdivide larger clumps .",
    "although it is likely that the @xmath0co transition is optically thick - particularly in the dense cores , we assume here that the integrated intensity scales linearly with the mass ( eg w95 ) , and use published @xmath12co studies of individual clumps ( where the masses can be measured more accurately ) to scale the results . in particular , patel et al .",

    ", we derive the clump mass distribution for the whole mapped region shown in the upper histogram of figure  14 .",
    "this can be fit by a slope of -0.8 ( shown by the dashed line ) for masses in the range 3 - 100@xmath50 .",
    "although clumps ( or `` globulettes '' ) with masses as small as @xmath142 can be detected in some sparse regions of the present datacube ( see fig .",
    "9 ) , the confusion limit is considerably higher in most regions , which results in the drop in the number counts below @xmath143 in fig .  14 .    the fitted slope in fig .",
    "14 implies a mass power law , @xmath144 , over the range 3 - 100@xmath50 , for the whole rmc .",
    "this compares with -1.6 found by schneider et al ( 1998 ) using two different datasets covering the se region alone , and -1.3 measured by w95 for the se region using a different clump - finding algorithm ( although their technique was noted by kramer et al . to blend low - mass gaussian clumps , resulting in a flatter slope ) .",
    "this value is similar to that found for other large - scale molecular clouds ( eg kramer et al . , 1998 ; heyer et al . , 2001",
    ") , suggesting there is no excess of compact , low - mass clumps in the rosette nebula , and that it is a typical gmc .",
    "there is marginal evidence of a steeper power law at the high mass end ( above 100@xmath50 ) , although this would need confirmation using a less abundant and hence optically thinner molecular species .",

    "co images ( eg fig .  9 ) show that these inner regions are apparently highly - clumped , and are presumably more disrupted by the central o stars ( see section 3.3.1 above ) . however , the three histograms show that not only is the power spectrum similar to that of other gmcs , but there is no clear difference in the mass distribution of clumps close to the o stars compared with that of the rmc as a whole .",

    "more recent infrared surveys have shown that several of these iras objects may actually be composed of young stellar clusters rather than individual luminous stars ( eg phelps & lada , 1997 ; poulton et al . , 2008 ) . moreover , as noted in section  3.3.2 above , the co clumps identified in w95 decompose into many sub - clumps at increased spatial resolution .",

    "this is best done at 24@xmath8 , where the resolution is high enough to identify individual stars , and the youngest , most embedded objects can be seen .",

    "noted the dearth of class i but abundance of class ii objects within the cluster ngc2244 .",
    "can these different sets of observations be reconciled ?",
    "co emission from a disk - only ( class ii ) source would not be detected with the present observations : for a typical disk of 300  au radius , an optically thick line and a mean temperature of 40k , beam dilution would give @xmath147 , an order of magnitude below the current observational limit .",
    "however , envelopes around young stars typically have radii an order of magnitude larger , and therefore would be detectable in our data .",
    "looking at their individual class i objects , 30/36 in the mapped area have nearby co emission ( within 30  arcsec ) .",
    "however , this is formally an upper limit to the association of gas and young stars , as in some cases the co may just lie along the line - of sight to the star .    using the same @xmath148:@xmath149 scaling factor as measured above ( see section 3.3.3 ) , we can estimate gas mass limits around the 6 class i objects identified by poulton et al . using complete seds , which have _",
    "no _ associated co. the resultant upper limits for their clump masses are @xmath150 .",
    "however , it may be that these objects are misclassified , and are actually class ii disks viewed edge - on ; a highly - inclined disk can mimic the sed of envelope - dominated structure due to the high extinction to the central star . in this case",
    ", we would not expect to detect co. the relatively small number of class i objects without associated co ( 6 , compared with 750 class ii objects ) is consistent with this intepretation , as long as the disks are geometrically thin .",
    "= 9.0 cm    poulton et al . required detections at multiple wavelengths to classify the objects .",
    "however , several additional compact objects can be seen in their longer - wavelength data , which were not formally identified as ysos , either due to incomplete sky coverage at all wavelengths or because they were too faint at some wavelengths .",
    "examples can be seen in the nw ridge , where compact 24-@xmath151 objects are associated with the tips of the 2 or 3 of the co clumps ( see fig .",
    "16 , left panel ) .",
    "optical images of the tip of the wrench clump also show evidence of an embedded star or compact reflection nebula ( gahm et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "many of the associations of ysos with co clumps are found near the bright rims at the edges of the molecular clouds , and resemble the young stars found in some evaporating globules within the eagle nebula ( eg mccaughrean & andersen , 2002 ) .",
    "figure  16 shows in detail some of the clearer examples of co clumps ( given by the contours ) and their association with 24@xmath8 point sources and bright - rimmed clouds .",
    "as argued above , these peaks in the co emission are too bright to be arise from a compact disk , and are likely to be evaporating envelope gas .",
    "this is confirmed by their ir classification as envelope - dominated in several cases ( see poulton et al . ) .",
    "if the @xmath152 m compact sources in the nw globules are also confirmed as young stars , it is likely they will have a similar velocity as that of the co gas  typically , the relative velocity of stars and their gas envelope is @xmath153 ( covey et al . , 2006 )",
    "this would imply that the nw ridge is forming stars which have a relative velocity of @xmath154 compared with the rest of the rmc .",
    "this compares with the escape velocity of the rmc of @xmath155 , implying this will eventually eject a ring of young stars .",
    "the molecular clouds in the vicinity of the rosette nebula , as revealed in the new co images , show a highly clumpy morphology , with sharp - edged clouds mostly facing the ob stars .",
    "the overall clumpy structure is very similar to the simulated images from sph modelling of the effects of o - star photoionisation on a turbulent molecular cloud ( cf dale et al .",
    ", 2007 , fig .  2 ) .",
    "their models suggested that the effect of the luminous stars on the surrounding star formation rate is rather modest ; triggered star formation in such circumstances is not a very significant phenomenon .",
    "the results of the present large - scale mapping of the molecular gas shows a good correlation between luminous young clusters ( with luminosity @xmath156 ) , high velocity outflows and bright regions of molecular emission .",
    "moreover in several cases , individual stars with envelopes are also associated with bright co clumps . in most cases , these are at the edges or rims of the gmc , facing the central nebula .",
    "a particularly clear example is clump 44 in table  2 , seen near the top of the middle panel in figure  16 . here",
    "a point - like 24-@xmath8 source lies at the centre of the head of the co clump .",
    "patel et al . (",
    "1993 ) identified an iras object near this location , with a luminosity of @xmath157 ( although this may be an upper limit as the @xmath158 flux is confused ) .",

    "white et al .",
    "( 1997 ) noted that there was a significant velocity gradient along the length of this globule .",
    "the new data ( figure  17 ) shows that this velocity gradient is remarkably constant , at @xmath159 over a distance of 1.7pc ( 270  arcsec ) behind the star .",
    "it is unclear at present whether the rdi model ( eg bertoldi & mckee , 1990 ; lefloch & lazareff , 1994 ) can predict such an extended and constant acceleration in the molecular gas behind such clumps ; in general most of their results show curvature in the position - velocity diagrams .",
    "furthermore the rdi model predicts significant velocity gradients only in the relatively short - lived ( and hence rare ) `` pre - cometary phase '' .",
    "the present results ( see table  2 ) show that significant velocity gradients are the norm rather than the exception for exposed molecular clumps .",
    "= 9.0 cm    a bright 24@xmath8 source lies near the centre of the head of clump 44 and , in general , the clearest associations of young stars and co clumps are found near the cloud edges ( see figure  16 for other examples ) .",
    "what fraction of the co clumps have embedded young stars ?",
    "this depends on the infrared sensitivity and hence the stellar luminosity limit of the observations and is , moreover , relatively insensitive to the most highly - embedded objects .",
    "but if we use the 24-@xmath160 m spitzer data to trace young stars and  in the absence of longer - wavelength , high - resolution data  assume that the luminosity scales with the @xmath161 flux , then we can estimate the luminosity detection limit in these data by scaling the bolometric luminosity of the clump  44 star . from this",
    ", we estimate a luminosity limit of @xmath162 - equivalent to a @xmath163 ( or f - type ) star at 2  myr age . in table  2",
    "we have indicated the clumps where a compact 24@xmath8 source has been identified within the co emission .",
    "approximately 40% of these clumps have such an object ; figure  18 shows that co clumps with stars ( indicated by the filled histogram ) tend to have somewhat higher velocity gradients compared with clumps without stars .",
    "this suggests that velocity gradients - which we associate with higher photoionisation and clump acceleration - are also related to the presence of a young , relatively luminous star .",
    "although the data can not detect lower - mass stars , it does suggest that the formation of early - type stars ( spectral class f or earlier ) and gas acceleration are linked .",
    "more sensitive observations of the _ apparently _ starless clumps would be of interest to determine whether all molecular clumps with velocity gradients contain stars , and whether the stellar mass is related to the local gas acceleration .",
    "= 8.0 cm    does the presence of a co clump and envelope associated with the embedded stars necessarily imply a more massive molecular clump was originally present , and that these are the youngest objects in the region ?",
    "the photoevaporation lifetime of a clump depends on its radius , @xmath164 , so compact , denser clumps will survive longer ( and will be accelerated more gradually , in the rdi model ) than larger , diffuse clumps .",
    "cores containing stars are thought to have a more centrally - peaked structure than starless cores ( eg ward - thompson et al . , 1994 ) , so for the same clump mass , we might expect clumps with a central star would be more centrally - peaked and hence survive longer in the uv environment , compared with a more diffuse starless core . in such circumstances , we would naturally expect to see that many of the longer - lasting clumps will be the ones containing young stars . rather than the stars still associated with molecular clumps and envelopes being the youngest objects",
    ", it would suggest that the presence of the star causes the molecular clump to survive longer in the uv field .",
    "further observations would be of interest to look for other differences between the clumps with and without young stars .",
    "a large - scale single - dish imaging survey covering 60@xmath3860  pc of the rosette nebula and rosette molecular cloud has been carried out with 14  arcsec resolution in the j=3 - 2 transition of @xmath0co .",
    "the resulting datacube has a high spatial dynamic range ( the ratio of map size to spatial resolution is @xmath165 ) , and reveals the complex and clumpy spatio - velocity structure in the molecular gas throughout the rmc .",
    "the following conclusions can be drawn :    * we identify @xmath72000 clumps with a mass distribution @xmath166 , independent of distance from the central o stars .",
    "this is similar to other less disrupted clouds , and suggests the clump mass distribution is not strongly affected by the o stars .",
