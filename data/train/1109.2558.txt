    "it has a smaller value than the other structure functions , which is consistent with this range consisting of alfvn waves @xcite , since they have wavevectors in the plane perpendicular to @xmath9 . it also remains smaller than the perpendicular structure function throughout the cascade but becomes larger than the parallel one at @xmath54 hz .",

    "the steepening towards small @xmath27 @xcite can be seen but there appears to be little variation with @xmath28 at large @xmath27 .    to visualize how the 3d anisotropy varies through the turbulent cascade , surfaces of constant power were calculated . at a selected structure function value , the corresponding frequency in each angle bin",
    "was found through linear interpolation and the scales corresponding to these frequencies were calculated using taylor s hypothesis .",

    "[ f6 ] , which is the surface of constant normalized power of @xmath58 ( marked as a red dotted line in fig .",
    "it can be seen that the structure of the compressive fluctuations is different to the alfvnic fluctuations : there is no anisotropy in the plane perpendicular to the mean field , meaning that the compressive fluctuations do not depend on the polarization of the alfvnic fluctuations . also , they are more elongated along the mean field direction than the alfvnic fluctuations : for a given perpendicular scale @xmath14 , the ratio @xmath59 is at least 2 or 3 times larger . due to limited angular resolution",
    "this is a lower limit ; by extrapolating the shape in fig .",
    "one could imagine that they are even more extended than can currently be measured .",
    "the spectral indices of @xmath39 for normalized powers between @xmath60 and @xmath61 are between 1.58 and 1.42 in all angle bins , with a typical standard error of the mean of 0.02 .",
    "this is different to the slow solar wind , where spectral indicies close to 5/3 are observed @xcite .",
    "this difference has also been noticed in the electron density spectrum @xcite , although the reason is not well understood .",
    "if the compressive fluctuations are indeed very anisotropic , then we would not expect to measure the true parallel spectral index with the current angular resolution , which may explain the presence of anisotropic structures yet no significant anisotropic scaling .",
    "we have shown that the alfvnic turbulence is locally anisotropic in the plane perpendicular to the mean field .",
    "since the direction of the anisotropy is associated with @xmath9 , the question naturally arises to what extent this anisotropy is a reflection of the solenoidality of the magnetic field @xcite . while the magnetic field has zero divergence at each point ,",
    "this does not imply that the correlation length along @xmath9 is infinite , because at any given scale we are considering finite field increments , not derivatives .",
    "the effect of solenoidality can be derived from knowledge of the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath9 .",
    "since we are considering the conditional structure function at each scale @xmath62 , the joint pdf @xmath63 , or , equivalently , the pdf of the vector @xmath9 is required . as a simple illustration ,",
    "consider the case where this pdf is gaussian and , therefore , fully determined by the second - order longitudinal correlation function @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the point separation in the perpendicular plane .",
    "the conditional structure function becomes @xmath66 where the transverse correlation function is @xmath67'$ ] from solenoidality @xcite .",
    "if , in the inertial range , @xmath68 , then @xmath69 therefore , the ratio of the correlation scales along and across the fluctuation direction for a given structure function value is scale - independent and equal to @xmath70 , which , for the measured value of @xmath71 , gives an anisotropy in the perpendicular plane of @xmath72 . since the measured anisotropy is larger than this ( varying between 3.2 and 3.8 ) , non - gaussianity is required to explain the observations .",
    "any scale - dependent alignment , e.g. , the dynamical alignment of @xcite , is likely to require non - gaussianity and therefore be closely related to the intermittency of the turbulence .",
    "our results show some important differences to an earlier study , which suggested that the small scale fluctuations are longest - correlated in one of the perpendicular directions and that the spectral index is different in all three directions @xcite .",
    "possible reasons for this include the different coordinate system used ( global rather than local ) , the presence of foreshock effects in @xcite or the different assumptions in the measurement technique .",
    "the fact that the compressive fluctuations are very elongated is consistent with the prediction , based on gyrokinetic theory , that they are passive to the alfvnic fluctuations , but have no parallel cascade along the exact magnetic field lines @xcite .",
    "this may explain why there is a compressive cascade in the solar wind : the compressive fluctuations are expected to be damped at a rate proportional to their parallel wavenumber @xmath73 @xcite but if @xmath74 is very small then they are not heavily damped and can cascade nonlinearly .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the less anisotropic compressive fluctuations are generated but are quickly damped , leaving the highly elongated structures to be observed .",
