    "the symmetrical splitting reflects the alternating sign of the ltsf from site to site , with a mean absolute value of the local moment which progressively shifts away from @xmath150 .    in order to compare the simulated local magnetization profiles with the nmr line shapes , structural details have to be considered .",
    "eight configurations of disorder in systems with @xmath127 sites were simulated . in order to reproduce 6000 unit cells , the local moments",
    "were then arranged into four different chains , with two inequivalent copper atoms each . at this first stage ,",
    "the dipolar coupling was neglected , but we considered the hyperfine coupling to both the longitudinal and the transverse magnetization . following the notation of ref .",
    ", for @xmath56 , the local hyperfine field @xmath151 at a general @xmath2si nuclear site can be written as : @xmath152 where the index @xmath6 runs over the four nearest - neighbor copper sites . with this notation",
    ", the relative nmr resonance frequency @xmath153 can be written as @xmath154 , with @xmath155 as the @xmath2si nuclear gyromagnetic ratio . from our previous study@xcite of bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1  we can fix the parameters @xmath156 t/@xmath7 , @xmath157 t/@xmath7 , whereas @xmath118 mhz at 7 t. each of the above hyperfine parameters , which couple the silicon nuclear magnetism to the longitudinal and transverse electronic magnetization of copper , represents the sum of four individual copper - to - silicon couplings . given the broken translational symmetry due to disorder , the individual cu - si couplings are essential for a quantitative comparison between data and theory .",
    "unfortunately , these can not be evaluated by experiment , leaving six unknown free parameters in the model .    for a comparison of the simulated nmr lines with data recorded at 5 k",
    ", we used the following parameters ( in t/@xmath7 units ) : @xmath158 , @xmath159 for the coupling to the transverse magnetization , and @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 for the coupling to the longitudinal one .",
    "the sign of the parameters @xmath163 changes according to the considered si nucleus . by making use of them and with no other free parameters , we succeeded in simulating the complete temperature dependence of the nmr lines , which account for the simultaneous presence of both an ltsf and a uniform magnetic field . the result is shown in fig .  [ fig : lines_nmr_simulation]d , where the agreement between data and the theoretical model is again remarkable .    to be more specific , for a comparison with the experiment , we calculated the line shapes by convoluting the distribution of local fields at the @xmath2si sites with a 2-khz wide gaussian , which is equivalent to the width of the line profile of pure bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1 , shown in the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : nmr_lines ] .",
    "the choice of the optimal binning range , which strongly affects the shape of the tails of the @xmath124 histograms in fig .",
    "[ fig : lines_nmr_simulation ] , was done by employing the algorithms proposed in refs .  .",
    "note that the lines displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : lines_nmr_simulation]d show that the averaging process over four cu sites removes the splitting in the original histograms in fig .",
    "[ fig : lines_nmr_simulation]c .",
    "in addition , the simulated lines shift with temperature , as indeed observed in the experiment .",
    "the minimally - shifted line shape at @xmath128 k reflects magnetic disorder . by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : lines_nmr_simulation]b and [ fig : lines_nmr_simulation]d , it may be seen that the inclusion of an ltsf in the simulations significantly improves the agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "therefore , from both a macroscopic and a local point of view , nmr data confirm that the static magnetic properties of bacu@xmath0sigeo@xmath1  are those of an rhc , with the addition of a residual ltsf .",
    "to cross check the consistency of the proposed model , it seems natural to consider the ltsf - induced effects also in the magnetometry data .",
    "since the influence of the ltsf grows with the applied field @xmath8 , we consider the calculated @xmath164 curves ( shown by dotted lines in fig .  [",
    "fig : m_h_qmc ] ) at two representative temperatures , @xmath165 k and 10 k. the calculation of @xmath164 at @xmath165 k , using the average exchange coupling @xmath166 mev , reflects the _ linear _ behavior expected for an isotropic heisenberg chain in its ll regime@xcite and differs substantially from the experimental data .",
    "in fact , this oversimplified model completely neglects the field - induced alignment of the still uncompensated spins that , in a random heisenberg chain , survive even at the lowest temperatures . on the other hand , qmc simulations using the @xmath11@xmath12 model discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : magnqmc ] and in ref .",
    "show significant improvements over the simplified `` average-@xmath16 '' model ( solid blue and red lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_h_qmc ] for @xmath165 k and 10 k , respectively ) .",
    "the next refinement was to include both a uniform and a staggered magnetization in the @xmath11@xmath12 model and combine them@xcite to obtain : @xmath167,\\ ] ] with @xmath168 the rhc magnetization in a uniform field .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_h_qmc ] , the qmc calculation for @xmath169 with @xmath78 unexpectedly fails to reproduce the data .",
    "a good agreement with the magnetization scans at both temperatures was , however , obtained using @xmath170 .",
    "the discrepancy in the prefactor is most probably due to the fact that the current model neglects the effects of structural disorder in bacu@xmath0sigeo@xmath1 .",
    "a more refined model taking into account such subtleties , by including a site - dependent @xmath13 value , was not implemented in the present analysis .",
    "nonetheless , the essence of rhc physics , which dominates the magnetic properties of the probed system , is born out by the combined investigation of bulk magnetometry , nmr measurements and qmc simulations . taken together",
    "they strongly suggest that bacu@xmath0sigeo@xmath1   is an excellent realization of a random heisenberg chain model , as originally claimed in ref .",
    ", thus providing the ideal testing ground for analytic theories modeling a random - singlet ground state .",
    "in conclusion , we considered the bacu@xmath0sigeo@xmath1  compound , where spin-@xmath102 cu@xmath147 ions interact via random exchange couplings , as a representative of rhc systems with bond disorder . we demonstrate that this spin - chain material has a ground state which is very well described on the basis of the rhc hamiltonian in eq .  .",
    "by using temperature- and magnetic field - dependent microscopic @xmath3si nmr measurements , combined with macroscopic magnetic - susceptibility data and results of detailed numerical quantum monte carlo simulations , we find a coherent description of the physical properties of the system , compatible with that of an rs phase .",
    "in particular , the considerable broadening of the nmr lines and the divergent magnetic response at low temperatures , combined with a nonlinear increase of the magnetization as a function of field at low @xmath113 , all reflect the presence of unpaired spins with arbitrary small couplings even at temperatures close to zero .",
    "specific refinements in the simulations of @xmath11-@xmath12 model have shown that the addition of a local transverse staggered field  ltsf ( similar to that present in the parent compound bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1)@xcite  is essential also for reproducing the observed nmr line shifts .",
    "since the magnetization of a singlet in an ltsf is proportional to the local field , the detection of the field distribution by future @xmath171cu nmr measurements may provide a direct way to explore the @xmath16 distribution in an rhc .",
    "in addition , besides the existing stretched - exponential nmr relaxation data,@xcite the spectral properties of random heisenberg chains would be more directly accessible if neutron scattering experiments in a lower energy range would be possible .",
    "the authors thank a.  feiguin ( northwestern university , boston ) , k.  pra ( epfl , lausanne ) , and o.  zaharko ( psi , villigen ) for useful discussions .",
    "the bacu@xmath0sigeo@xmath1  samples used in this work were prepared in the early 2000 s in the group of prof .",
    "k.  uchinokura at the university of tokyo .",
    "this work was financially supported in part by the schweizerische nationalfonds zur frderung der wissenschaftlichen forschung ( snf ) and the nccr research pool manep of snf .",
    "in order to correctly interpret the numerical results , it is necessary to mention the theoretical expectations for the error bars in qmc simulations ( i.e. , specific to this method ) , in relation to the self - averaging induced errors ( i.e. , specific to disorder).@xcite for a spin chain of length @xmath110 , one can define the ratio @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is any macroscopic variable subject to self - averaging and @xmath174 denotes the same quantity averaged over the realizations of disorder.@xcite by using @xmath175  monte carlo updates \" ( the number of random updates of the system performed by the algorithm before a new configuration is generated ) and @xmath176 independent monte carlo measurements in a system of 6000 spins , the relative error for @xmath177 in low - temperature qmc simulations was found to be 10 times lower than @xmath178 , the error due to the average on all the realizations of disorder . therefore , in our case @xmath178 is the dominant simulation error .",
    "whenever the correlation length is @xmath179 , self - averaging can be justified based on the central - limit theorem.@xcite in case of critical systems , where the correlation length tends to diverge ( @xmath180 ) , the only way to obtain meaningful results in the presence of disorder consists in increasing the system size @xmath110 . by simulating systems with different spin - chain lengths @xmath110 , we find that @xmath181 , with @xmath182 the standard deviation of the local spin susceptibility .",
    "this implies the correct evaluation of the thermodynamic limit even in the problematic @xmath183 case .",
    "incidentally , since @xmath182 is smaller at higher temperatures and magnetic fields , this justifies the smaller error bars in these regions .",
