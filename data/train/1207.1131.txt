    "the use of optical dipole traps for manipulating and trapping ultra - cold atoms has been crucial to the evolution of this field of research . for example",
    "they can be used to form a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite , create artificial crystal of light @xcite or study physics in low dimensions by freezing spatial degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "light - matter interactions in dense regime is a very dynamic and challenging field of research @xcite where one of the long standing problem is the understanding of the role of cooperative effects ( superradiance @xcite , subradiance @xcite , collective lamb shift @xcite ) and disorder ( weak @xcite and strong localization @xcite ) . in order to reach this regime ,",
    "a dipole trap can be used to compress the cloud to high densities where the strong localization phase transition @xcite is expected to occur at a threshold given by the ioffe - reggel criterion @xcite @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the light wavevector and @xmath5 is the mean free path ( @xmath6 the atomic density , @xmath7 the scattering cross section ) . for resonant two - level systems ,",
    "the scattering cross section @xmath8 allows to express the ioffe - reggel criterion as @xmath9 .",
    "such densities correspond for rubidium atoms to @xmath10 , three orders of magnitude higher than magneto - optical trap ( mot ) densities .",
    "these high densities are commonly obtained in dipole trap for bosonic @xcite or fermionic @xcite ultra - cold gases .",
    "however , the relatively low number of atoms ( @xmath11 ) and long duty cycles ( @xmath12 ) make it difficult to efficiently study light - matter interaction in dense regimes @xcite where a large number of atoms as well as short duty cycles are important assets for efficient detection of signatures of cooperative effects and/or strong localization of light .",
    "indeed the ioffe - reggel criterion should not be confused with the bec threshold @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the thermal de broglie wavelength .",
    "contrary to bose - einstein condensation , we do not expect a drastic constraint on temperature for the ioffe - regel criterion of strong localization .    in this paper",
    ", we present a compressible blue detuned crossed dipole trap to achieve a very fast dynamical compression ( @xmath0 ) of a large number of @xmath15rb atoms ( @xmath16 ) to densities compatible with the ioffe - reggel criterion , i.e. @xmath2 . trapping atoms in a ` dark ' region surrounded by blue - detuned light",
    "has several advantages such as minimizing photon scattering , light shifts of the atomic levels , and light - assisted collisional losses @xcite",
    ". experimentally , blue - detuned trap are more difficult to produce than red ones .",
    "however , an original method @xcite consists in using a focused gaussian laser beam which is rapidly rotating using two perpendicular acousto - optical modulators ( aoms ) . if the rotation frequency is sufficiently high , the resulting time - averaged potential forms a tube of light .",
    "crossing two of these tubes leads to a ` dark ' volume where atoms are trapped .",
    "this method allows to dynamically control the shape and the size of the trap which for example might be used to optimize the loading efficiency with a large trapping volume and then compress the cloud using a fast dynamical reduction of the trap size .",
    "these blue detuned time - averaged potentials have been used in the past to study thermal cloud compression @xcite , optical billiards and chaos @xcite , or designing microscopically tailored potentials for becs @xcite or ultra - cold fermi gases @xcite . for red dipole traps ,",
    "a dynamical compression allowed reaching quantum degeneracy _ via _ a runaway evaporative cooling using a mobile lens to change the trap waist dynamically .",
    "the trap consists in two tubes of blue - detuned light , crossed at @xmath17 to create a box of light ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ( a ) ) where the atoms are confined .",
    "the size and the shape of the box can be dynamically adjusted .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) shows the experimental setup to create the tubes of light . a laser beam with @xmath18 waist passes through two aoms ( gooch & housego m080 - 2b / f - gh2 ) , crossed at @xmath17 .",

    "the central frequency @xmath21 is fixed at @xmath22 , the modulation frequency amplitude @xmath23 is at most @xmath24 and the modulation frequency @xmath25 is generally set to @xmath26 . in the @xmath27 diffraction order of the aoms , the laser beam is rotating at frequency @xmath25 and a lens , placed at a focal distance of @xmath28 from the aoms , creates a time - averaged tube of light with a diameter of @xmath18 and a waist of @xmath29 in the lens focal plane where the atoms are trapped .",
    "using a system of lenses and mirrors , the tube can be ` recycled ' and crossed at @xmath17 from its initial direction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "varying the modulation frequency amplitude @xmath23 , the trap size can be dynamically controlled .",
    "a rotating laser beam with power @xmath30 , waist @xmath31 and a radial intensity profile given by @xmath32 describing a circle of radius @xmath33 , creates a time average intensity profile @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the radial distance of the polar coordinate system and @xmath36 is the zeroth - order modified bessel function . for @xmath15rb atoms ,",

    "[ fig2 ] shows the radial profile of the timed - averaged potential for two trap radii as well as its harmonic approximation .",
    "the possibility to control the trap frequency by tuning its radius can allow for runaway evaporative cooling by compensating the reduction of the trap frequency due to the lowering of the potential barrier ( reducing the intensity or increasing the detuning ) by a reduction of the size of the trap .",

    "a careful control of the approach of the final trap radius is thus required when reaching the harmonic regime .",

    "such semiconductor laser systems have the advantage of moderate costs and the simplicity of implementation .",
    "however , they often have a modest mode quality and more importantly they possess an amplified spontaneous emission background which spreads over @xmath64 , containing photons at resonance with the atomic line",
    ". for experiments where this background spectrum is a limitation , a titanium - sapphire laser or a frequency doubled laser might be a more convenient choice .      in order to create the tubes of light , a precise control on the rf - signals feeding the aoms",
    "is necessary . for this , we use voltage control oscillators ( vcos ) delivering rf - signals whose instant frequencies @xmath65 linearly depend on the input voltages @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the two input voltages @xmath67 are associated to a position @xmath68 in the @xmath27 diffraction order of the aoms , such that it is possible to create tubes of light with arbitrary cross sections .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the signals @xmath66 which produce circular and square tubes as well as the subsequent experimental pictures of these cross sections .",

    "[ fig3 ] ( b ) , we notice that the ring - shaped potential is slightly asymmetric .",
    "we attribute this to nonlinearities in the overall system response @xmath73 which is supported by the fact that this asymmetry is reduced for smaller traps since they require lower modulation amplitudes .",
    "the square - shaped trap is not affected because its parametric equations do not lead to a combined motion in the @xmath74 and @xmath75 directions ( the nonlinearities only imply that straight lines are not drawn at constant speed ) . by designing and engineering the synthesizer signals driving the vcos , it would be possible to compensate for the trap asymmetry .",
    "however , all the measurements performed in this paper use the ring - shaped potential without compensating for the asymmetry to keep the system complexity to a minimum .      unless otherwise stated , the parameters of the trap are : size @xmath76 ( radius @xmath77 ) , waist @xmath78 , detuning @xmath79 , rotation frequency @xmath80 , laser power for a single tube @xmath81 , linear polarization . for these parameters ,",

    "the loading time can be reduced by increasing the rubidium background pressure when a larger atom number needs to be trapped using e.g. ultraviolet leds to temporarly increase the hot gas pressure during the mot loading - the so - called light - induced atomic desorption ( liad ) @xcite .",
    "the cooling laser detuning is @xmath86 and the temperature of the cloud is @xmath87 .",
    "we then apply a @xmath88 temporal dark mot period where the intensity of the repumping laser is reduced by a factor of @xmath89 and the detuning of the cooling beam is increased from @xmath86 to @xmath90 .",
    "this allows to compress and produce a homogeneous distribution of atoms , mainly in the @xmath91 hyperfine ground state , with a density @xmath92 and a temperature @xmath93 . during the temporal dark mot period , the intensity of the dipole trap is progressively ramped up in order to maximize the ` mode matching ' between the dark mot and the dipole trap .",
    "after this , the magnetic field and the laser cooling beams are turned off . in order to keep the atoms in a single hyperfine level",
    ", we choose to keep the repumping laser on at all times after loading , thus forcing the atoms into the @xmath94 hyperfine level .",
    "hyperfine level would instead require the development of a specific depumping laser .",
    "indeed maintaining the mot cooling beams on to pump the atoms in the @xmath91 hyperfine level would not be efficient and would lead to several scattered photons , thus preventing us from attaining our goal of reaching high densities .",

    "this might be due to the the increased sensitivity to instabilities for small traps .",
    "indeed , in the harmonic regime , the trap frequency is very sensitive to the trap size .",
    "inelastic ( ` s - wave ' or / and light assisted ) collisions can also play a role at high densities and contribute to the observed fluctuations .",
    "[ fig14 ] ( c ) shows the phase space density @xmath219 as a function of the final trap size .",
    "as previously discussed , the phase space density is conserved for an adiabatic compression if the trap geometry does not change ( the density of states is conserved ) .",
    "we observe that for a @xmath212 compression time , phase space density is conserved but it is no longer the case when the compression time is @xmath95 .",
    "[ fig14 ] ( d ) shows the fraction of remaining atoms after compression .",
    "we manage to keep more than @xmath220 of the atoms which is very promising .",
    "to do so , we need to compress faster than any loss mechanism .",
    "in particular , faster that the trap lifetime for the final trap size we are aiming at ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the experiments performed above are designed to understand how compression works .",
    "they are carried out using a @xmath85 mot loading time from a low pressure background gas resulting in a modest number of atoms loaded into the trap @xmath221 .",
    "techniques to increase the number of trapped atoms include making the loading time longer , rising the background gas pressure using liad or enlarging the initial trap volume .",
    "the latter is something difficult to achieve with our current setup .",
    "therefore , a cloud with more atoms but a larger initial size would not increase significantly the number of trapped atoms . improving the dark mot density ( by further detuned trapping lasers ) will be important to increase the number of trapped atoms well beyond @xmath222 .    to test the performances of the trap",
    "we simply increase the mot loading time to @xmath223 .",
    "we also use a detuning of @xmath110 ( compared to @xmath111 usually ) to increase the potential height . in these conditions ,",
    "@xmath224 atoms are loaded into the trap .",
    "after compressing the cloud to a final size of @xmath225 in @xmath95 , we measure a density of @xmath226 , which corresponds to @xmath227 compatible with the ioffe - reggel criterion .",
    "this setup thus proves to be an effective tool to rapidly compress a large atomic cloud down to the strong localization threshold paving the way for efficient exploration of light - matter interaction in the dense regime . in the future",
    ", the trap performances can be further improved by having a more precise control on the trap size evolution when the trap enters the harmonic regime since in this regime the parameters of the trap ( e.g. the trap frequency ) vary very fast with its radius .      when the cloud is compressed",
    ", the spatial density and the temperature rise , which makes the cloud enter into a regime where collisions are no longer negligible on the timescale of the experiments @xcite .",
    "the elastic collision rate is given by @xmath228 where @xmath6 is the cloud density , @xmath229 is the mean relative atom velocity and @xmath7 is the total elastic cross section . if we consider pure ` s - wave ' collisions , which in our case is a strong approximation given the temperature of the gas ( where higher order collisions , e.g. ` p - wave ' collisions , can occur ) , the total cross section is given by @xmath230 for identical bosons ( @xmath231 for non - identical particles ) , where @xmath33 is the scattering length",
    ". elastic ` s - wave ' collision rates computed for the data of the experiments presented in section [ exprea ] are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] ( a ) . during compression , the collision rate increases by almost two orders of magnitude ( from @xmath232 to @xmath233 ) . in our compressed trap",
    ", s - wave collisions are thus expected to become relevant with subsequent thermalization and evaporation .",
    "[ fig15 ] ( b ) shows the cloud temperature as a function of the holding time just after compression .",
    "the cloud is compressed during @xmath234 and the trap parameters are kept constant after compression .",
    "the state of the system after compression is the initial condition for this experiment : the smaller the final trap size , the denser and hotter the cloud , leading to higher ` s - wave ' collision rates . on fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] ( b ) , we notice that the temperature reduction is faster when the cloud is initially hotter and denser ( i.e. the trap size after compression is smaller ) , which strongly hints towards thermalization due to ` s - wave ' collisions .",
    "the elastic collision rates computed from eq .",
    "( [ collrate ] ) ( see caption of fig . [ fig15 ] ) are compatible with the timescale of the temperature reduction observed on fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] ( b ) .",
    "indeed , three or four elastic collisions are needed for the gas to thermalize @xcite .",
    "we note that pumping the atoms into the @xmath91 hyperfine level ( instead of @xmath94 used in this work ) would allow to avoid unwanted hyperfine changing collisions occurring at large densities .",
    "we have studied a blue detuned crossed dipole trap designed to quickly compress cold atomic clouds to high densities .",
    "extensive characterization of the system has lead to the understanding of the properties and the dynamics of this novel trapping scheme . after a very efficient loading of a large number of atoms ( up to @xmath1 ) ,",
    "the cloud is compressed in @xmath95 from an initial density of @xmath235 to a final density of @xmath226 .",
    "the cloud density in the final stage is very close the ioffe - reggel criterion , demonstrating the efficiency and reliability of this technique to study light - matter interactions in the dense regime .",
    "the outlook of this work includes improving the trap performances by optimizing the trap loading ( e.g. denser dark mot , compensating for gravity ... ) , having a better control on the final compression state or using sisyphus cooling during the early compression stages .",
    "in addition to these modifications concerning the experimental protocol , improvements of the setup itself would lead to substantial performance leaps using e.g. a more detuned and powerful laser to reduce spontaneous emission losses or using vcos with a higher input modulation bandwidth and a better frequency stability .    increasing the trap lifetime would allow using this setup for producing quantum degenerate gases .",
    "this kind of compressible dipole trap would make the loading and evaporation proceed differently from standard approach to optical bec , yielding larger becs more quickly .",
    "it would consist in reaching a high collision rate during a first compression stage and then realizing runaway evaporative cooling . to do so",
    ", the trap frequency should be maintained constant by reducing the trap size when the trap power is reduced .",
    "this technique would not require mobile lenses @xcite allowing for faster and more stable operations ."
