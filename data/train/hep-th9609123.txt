    "211 + 91405 orsay cdex , france + and + laboratory of theoretical physics + joint institute for nuclear research + 141980 dubna , russia _    _ dedicated to the memory of victor  i.  ogievetsky _    0    in the last decades a tremendous progress has been achieved in understanding of low - dimensional integrable field theories and statistical models .",
    "apart from the fact that their study serves as a laboratory for testing a new ideas , it has been expected for a long time that low - dimensional integrable systems should appear in the description of the effective dynamics of quantized ( 3 + 1)dimensional yang - mills theories ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these expectations were confirmed in 1994 by two examples coming from different problems : the exact calculation of low - energy effective action of @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills theory @xcite and study of the regge asymptotics of perturbative qcd @xcite .",
    "it was found that well - known integrable structures emerge in both problems .    in the first example @xcite , the seiberg  witten solution for the low - energy effective action of pure @xmath0 susy yang - mills theory with the @xmath1 gauge group and its generalization to other gauge groups @xcite were interpreted within the framework of finite - gap solutions of the soliton equations and their whitham deformations @xcite . in particular , the moduli space of vacua of @xmath0 susy @xmath2 yang - mills theory without matter was identified as a moduli space of hyperelliptic curve @xmath3 , which amazingly enough coincides with the spectral curve of 1-dimensional periodic toda chain with @xmath4 sites @xcite . moreover , including the matter hypermultiplets in the adjoint and fundamental representations leads to a deformation of the toda spectral curve into the spectral curves corresponding to the calogero - moser integrable models @xcite and heisenberg spin chains @xcite , respectively .",
    "the effective energy and the bps spectrum of excitations can be expressed in terms of periods of a certain meromorphic 1-differential on @xmath3 , which has a defining property that its external derivative is a holomorphic differential on @xmath3 .",
    "this differential was identified as a generating functional of the whitham equations describing the adiabatic deformations of soliton solutions @xcite . there were different proposals to interpret the whitham dynamics @xcite but , despite of a lot of efforts , the connection between integrable systems and the seiberg - witten solution still has a status of an observation and the underlying dynamical mechanism remains mysterious .",
    "our second example is related to the asymptotics of qcd at high energy and fixed transferred momentum , @xmath5 , the famous regge limit @xcite .",
    "it has been observed many years ago ( see e.g. @xcite ) that perturbative expressions for the scattering amplitudes in qcd in the regge limit have a striking similarity with predictions of a low - dimensional field theory .",
    "indeed , it was realized that in the regge limit qcd should be replaced by an effective @xmath6dimensional reggeon field theory @xcite , which should inherit all ( still unknown ) quantum symmetries of qcd .",
    "recently , different attempts have been undertaken to deduce its effective action out of qcd @xcite .",
    "the resulting expressions become very complicated and the exact solution of the @xmath7matrix of the reggeon effective theory remains problematic .",
    "nevertheless , there exists a meaningful approximation to the reggeon effective theory , the so - called generalized leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) @xcite , in which the @xmath7matrix of qcd exhibits remarkable properties of integrability .",
    "it turns out that in this approximation qcd is effectively described by the 1-dimensional _ quantum _ xxx heisenberg magnet of spin @xmath8 @xcite . as a result",
    ", one can calculate the regge asymptotics of the scattering amplitudes by applying a powerful quantum inverse scattering method @xcite .",
    "in particular , the bethe ansatz solution of perturbative qcd @xmath7matrix in the generalized lla has been developed in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the separation of variables and leads to the baxter equation for the xxx heisenberg magnet @xcite .",
    "the exact solution of the baxter equation was established in a few special cases @xcite and different approaches to its general solution were proposed in @xcite .",
    "one of them is based on the quasiclassical expansion of the baxter equation @xcite .",
    "it allows to obtain asymptotic approximations to the solutions of the baxter equation , which are in a good agreement with the results of numerical calculations .    in the present paper",
    "we continue the study of the baxter equation started in @xcite .",
    "we show that the wkb solution of the baxter equation , describing the regge limit of qcd , gives rise to the same integrable structures as appeared in the seiberg - witten solution for @xmath0 susy qcd and in the finite - gap solutions of the soliton equations .",
    "we explain the origin of hyperelliptic riemann surfaces out of qcd in the regge limit and discuss the meaning of whitham dynamics on their moduli space .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we demonstrate the relation between high - energy qcd in the regge limit and xxx heisenberg magnet .",
    "the hamiltonian of the 1-dimensional xxx heisenberg magnet appears as a kernel of the bethe - salpeter equation for the partial waves of the scattering amplitudes in multi - color qcd .",
    "its diagonalization is performed in sect .  3 by applying the method of separation of variables @xcite , which leads to the baxter equation .",
    "in sect .",
    "4 we develop a nonlinear wkb expansion of the baxter equation .",
    "we describe in detail the classical mechanics induced by the leading term of the wkb solution and establish a close relation between reggeon compound states in qcd and soliton solutions of the kp / toda hierarchy @xcite .",
    "the quantization conditions for the reggeon compound states and their interpretation in terms of the whitham flows are discussed in sect .",
    "the concluding remarks are summarized in sect .",
    "let us consider elastic hadron - hadron scattering in qcd at high energy , @xmath9 , and fixed transferred momentum , @xmath10 , and let us replace for simplicity nonperturbative hadronic states by perturbative onium states built from two heavy quarks with mass @xmath11 .",
    "in this case , the scattering amplitude can be calculated in perturbative qcd as a sum of feynman diagrams describing the multi - gluon exchanges between heavy quarks in the @xmath12channel @xcite . in the regge limit , @xmath13",
    ", the perturbative expressions for the feynman diagrams involve large logarithmic corrections , @xmath14 , which can be classified into the leading logs ( @xmath15 ) , next - to - leading logs ( @xmath16 ) etc . and which have to be resummed to all orders in @xmath17 .",
    "we recall , however , that one of the basic concepts of perturbative approach in qcd is that one considers quarks and gluons as elementary excitations and , assuming that their interaction is small , takes it into account as a perturbative expansion in @xmath17 .",
    "the necessity of resuming perturbative series indicates that the description of a hadron - hadron scattering in terms of `` bare '' quarks and gluons is not appropriate anymore in the regge limit and one has to identify instead a new collective degrees of freedom , in terms of which the qcd dynamics will be simpler . in the regge limit , due to remarkable property of the reggeization in qcd @xcite , reggeized gluons , or reggeons ,",
    "become a new collective excitations .",
    "although the reggeon is built from an infinite number of `` bare '' gluons it behaves as a point - like particle .",
    "it carries the color charge of a gluon and it has a 4-momentum @xmath18 with the longitudinal components @xmath19 belonging to the plane defined by the momenta of scattering hadrons and @xmath20 being 2-dimensional transverse momentum .",
    "the hadrons scatter each other by exchanging reggeons in the @xmath12channel and the interaction between reggeons is described by the effective @xmath7matrix , which should be obtained out of qcd in the regge limit .",
    "the reggeon @xmath7matrix has the following remarkable properties .",
    "reggeons propagate in the @xmath12channel between two hadrons and due to strong ordering of their longitudinal momenta the reggeon rapidity @xmath21 can be interpreted as a `` time '' in the @xmath12channel @xcite .",
    "then , the reggeon @xmath7matrix describes the propagation of the reggeons in the time @xmath22 . interacting with each other reggeons",
    "change their 2-dimensional transverse momenta @xmath20 and color charge . therefore , although reggeons `` live '' in 4-dimensional minkowski space - time , their @xmath12channel evolution is described by the effective @xmath6dimensional @xmath7matrix @xcite .",
    "the exact expression for the reggeon @xmath7matrix is unknown yet and one may try to evaluate it in different approximations . in what follows we will study the reggeon @xmath7matrix in the generalized lla @xcite . in this approximation one",
    "preserves the unitarity of the @xmath7matrix in the direct ( @xmath23 , @xmath12 and @xmath24 ) channels but not in the subchannels .",
    "the hadron - hadron ( or onium - onium ) scattering amplitude is given in the generalized lla by the sum of effective reggeon feynman diagrams @xcite in which , first , the number of reggeons propagating in the @xmath12channel is preserved ( no creation / annihilation of reggeons ) and , second , only two reggeons could interact with each other at the same moment of `` time '' @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , according to the number of reggeons , @xmath25 , the scattering amplitude can be decomposed as @xmath26 where the @xmath27th term describes the evolution in the @xmath12channel of the system of @xmath25 reggeons with a pair - wise interaction . the amplitude @xmath28 satisfies the bartels - kwiecinski - praszalowicz equation @xcite , which can be interpreted as a bethe - salpeter equation for the @xmath25 reggeon scattering amplitude",
    "its solutions define the color - singlet @xmath25 reggeon compound states , perturbative qcd pomerons and odderons , whose contribution to the scattering amplitudes takes the standard regge form @xmath29 where indices @xmath30 and @xmath31 refer to the scattered hadrons . here , @xmath32 is the energy of the @xmath25 reggeon compound state .",
    "it is defined as an eigenvalue of the @xmath25 reggeon hamiltonian _",
    "n|_n,\\{q}= e_n,\\{q}|_n,\\{q } , with @xmath33 being some set of quantum numbers parameterizing all possible solutions .",
    "the residue functions @xmath34 and @xmath35 measure the overlapping between hadronic wave functions and the wave functions of the @xmath25 reggeon compound states @xmath36 the pair - wise reggeon hamiltonian @xmath37 acts in ( [ bkp ] ) on 2-dimensional transverse momenta of @xmath25 reggeons and the relation ( [ bkp ] ) has the form of a ( 2 + 1)dimensional schrdinger equation .",
    "let us change the representation from 2dimensional transverse reggeon momenta space @xmath20 to 2-dimensional impact parameter space @xmath38 and define the holomorphic and antiholomorphic complex coordinates of reggeons as z_j=_j+i_j,|z_j=_j - i_j , j=1,2, ... ,n .",
    "remarkable property of the reggeon hamiltonian @xmath37 is that being expressed in terms of holomorphic and antiholomorphic reggeon coordinates , it splits in the multi - color limit , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , into the sum of holomorphic and antiholomorphic hamiltonians @xcite and @xmath41 this relation is exact even for finite @xmath4 . ] @xmath42=0\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 act on holomorphic and antiholomorphic reggeon coordinates , respectively .",
    "since the hamiltonians @xmath43 and @xmath44 commute with each other , the original ( 2 + 1)dimensional schrdinger equation ( [ bkp ] ) can be replaced by the system of holomorphic and antiholomorphic ( 1 + 1)dimensional schrdinger equations h_n|_n,\\{q } = _ n,\\{q } |_n,\\{q } , _",
    "n|_n,\\{q } = _ n,\\{q } |_n,\\{q } , which define the spectrum of the reggeon compound states as follows e_n,\\{q } = ( _ n,\\{q}+_n,\\{q } ) , _",
    "n,\\{q}(z,|z)= _ n,\\{q}(z ) _",
    "n,\\{q}(|z ) , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the full set of @xmath25 reggeon holomorphic and antiholomorphic coordinates .",
    "thus , in the generalized lla perturbative ( 3 + 1)dimensional multi - color qcd is effectively replaced by the system of ( 1 + 1)dimensional schrdinger equations ( [ hol ] ) .",
    "the properties of two equations in ( [ hol ] ) are similar and in what follows we will study only the holomorphic schrdinger equation in ( [ hol ] ) for fixed number of reggeons @xmath25 .",
    "the holomorphic hamiltonian @xmath43 describes the nearest - neighbour interaction between @xmath25 reggeons with holomorphic coordinates @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and periodic boundary conditions @xmath50 h_n = _ j=1^n+1 h_j , j+1 and @xmath51 . here",
    ", the interaction hamiltonian between two reggeons , @xmath52 , is given by the bfkl kernel @xcite h_12h(z_1,z_2 ) = -(-j_12 ) - ( 1+j_12 ) + 2(1 ) , where @xmath53 and the operator @xmath54 is defined as an operator solution of the equation @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "we stress that the operator ( [ ker ] ) was originally derived @xcite from the analysis of feynman diagrams contributing to the regge asymptotics of the onium - onium scattering amplitude in perturbative qcd .",
    "therefore , it was quite unexpected to find @xcite that it coincides with the hamiltonian of 1-dimensional xxx heisenberg magnet of spin @xmath8 corresponding to the principal series representation of the @xmath57 group . the number of sites of the spin chain is equal to the number of reggeons .    among other things",
    "this equivalence means that the holomorphic schrdinger equation ( [ hol ] ) possesses the family of hidden mutually commuting conserved charges @xcite = [ q_k , h_n ] = 0 and their number is large enough for the system ( [ hol ] ) to be completely integrable . to identify the conservation laws for the system of @xmath25 interacting reggeons",
    "one applies the quantum inverse scattering method @xcite and uses well - known constructions for the heisenberg magnet @xcite .",
    "namely , to each reggeon we assign the ( auxiliary ) lax operator l_k = (    cc + i s_k^3 & is_k^- + is_k^+ & - i s_k^3    ) = + i ( 1z_k)(z_k , -1)_k , where @xmath58 is an arbitrary complex parameter and @xmath59 are spin @xmath8 generators of the @xmath60 group acting on the holomorphic coordinates of the @xmath61th reggeon @xmath62 then , we construct the monodromy matrix t ( ) = l_n ( ) l_n-1 ( ) ... l_1 ( ) = (    cc a ( ) & b ( ) + c ( ) & d ( )    ) , where the operators @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 act on the holomorphic coordinates of @xmath25 reggeons and satisfy the yang - baxter equation @xcite . finally , we obtain the transfer matrix as ( ) = t ( ) = a ( ) + d ( ) and verify , using ( [ lax ] ) and ( [ t ] ) , that @xmath65 is a polynomial of the degree @xmath25 in @xmath58 ( ) = 2^n + q_2 ^n-2 + ... + q_n , with the coefficients @xmath66 being operators acting on holomorphic coordinates of the reggeons",

    "heisenberg magnet and 1-dimensional toda chain @xcite , the hamiltonian @xmath43 does not enter into the expansion of the auxiliary transfer matrix ( [ trt ] ) . to obtain @xmath43",
    "one has to construct the fundamental transfer matrix . ]",
    "thus , we identify the operators @xmath68 , @xmath48 , @xmath69 as @xmath70 conserved charges for the system of @xmath25 interacting reggeons . to match the number of conservation laws with the number of reggeons , one needs",
    "one more conserved charge .",
