    "t tauri stars ( tts ) are young , late - type stars contracting to the main sequence ( ms ) . in their evolution",
    "pre - main sequence stars pass through a phase before reaching the ms , defined as post t tauri stars ( ptts ) .",
    "herbig  ( 1978 ) first defined ptts as young stars more evolved than classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) but still contracting to the ms .",
    "ptts are difficult to detect because they do not show extreme properties which make them easy to identify : unlike ctts , they do not show ir or uv excesses and the h@xmath1 line is not longer seen in emission .",
    "therefore , their identification relies on the presence of the li i ( 6708 ) absorption line and the ca ii chromospheric lines in their spectra as well as on their x - ray emission .",
    "murphy ( 1969 ) was the first to propose that ptts could be found in binary systems composed of early - type primaries and late - type secondaries , given that the ms lifetime of high - mass stars is comparable to the contraction timescale of late - type stars to the ms .",
    "gahm et al .",
    "( 1983 ) and lindroos ( 1985 ) carried out photometric and spectroscopic observations of 253 binary systems and lindroos ( 1986 ) was able to isolate a sample of 78 visual binary systems with likely ptts secondaries .    the x - ray emission from these ptts candidates as observed by _",

    "the derived x - ray luminosities for most of the late - type stars range between @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "these values are comparable to those reported for t tauri stars stars ( neuhuser et al .",
    "1995 ) , showing that ptts although somewhat more evolved are still strong x - ray emitters .",
    "pms late - type stars are also known to emit x - ray flares ( see e.g. feigelson & decampli 1981 , montmerle et al .",
    "1983 , stelzer et al . 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , we have studied the x - ray lightcurves of all lindroos ptts candidates observed by the _ rosat _ satellite ( see hulamo et al .",
    "2000 for further details ) in order to search for x - ray variability due to activity episodes .    as a result of our study of the _ rosat _ pspc and hri lightcurves of the lindroos systems ,",
    "we have detected a large flare from hd560 , a binary system composed of a b9 and a g5 star .",
    "a previous flaring episode from hd560 observed with _",
    "exosat _ was reported by tagliaferri et al .",
    "the _ exosat _",
    "medium energy experiment provided no spatial resolution , however .",
    "therefore , it was unclear whether to ascribe the event to hd560 or to the nearby seyfert type i galaxy , qso0007 + 107 , located at @xmath3 and @xmath4 . while pounds & turner  ( 1987 ) attributed the flare to the galaxy , tagliaferri et al .",
    "( 1988 ) argued in favor of hd560 .",
    "the observation of another flare with the _ rosat _ pspc whose spatial resolution is sufficient to identify the flaring source with hd560 , supports the arguments put forth by tagliaferri et al .",
    "( 1988 ) . in this paper",
    "we provide an analysis of the _ rosat _ data of hd560 , and discuss the flare event .",
    "the x - ray telescope and the instrumentation onboard the _ rosat _ satellite are described in detail by trmper ( 1983 ) , pfeffermann et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and david et al .",
    "the data presented in this work were obtained with the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) in pointed mode .",
    "the spectral resolution of the pspc ( 43% at 0.93 kev ) allows spectral analysis in three energy bands : + - soft : 0.1 to 0.4kev + - hard 1 : 0.5 to 0.9kev + - hard 2 : 0.9 to 2.0kev + we can obtain spectral information of our sources studying the x - ray hardness ratios ( @xmath5 ) defined as follows : + @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the counts observed in the hard 1 and hard 2 bands , and @xmath9 are the counts observed in the soft band .",
    "hence , @xmath5 values can range from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,^,>,>,>,^,^ , > \" , ]     hd560 was observed twice by the pspc .",
    "the details of these two observations are summarized in table 1 , where the _ rosat _ observation request number ( ror ) is provided .",
    "columns @xmath12 show the position of the x - ray detection , its displacement with respect to the b9 and g5 components of hd560 , respectively , and the distance of the x - ray source to the center of the detector .",
    "the latter number is important , given that the spatial resolution of the pspc is off - axis dependent .",
    "the count rates , exposure times , and @xmath5 s are given in columns  @xmath13 .",
    "an estimation of the probability of the detection according to the maximum likelihood ( ml ) algorithm implemented in exsas ( extended scientific software analysis system , zimmermann et al . 1995 ) is given in the last column .",
    "note that @xmath14 corresponds to a 2.7@xmath15 signal over the background .",
    "the spatial resolution of the pspc ( @xmath16 at @xmath17 at the center of the detector ) does not allow to resolve the binary system ( @xmath18 separation ) .",
    "therefore , in both observations there is a single x - ray detection located at @xmath196  from the binary system ( see table  [ tab : xray_info ] ) .",
    "during the _ rosat _ pspc observation ror701092p the binary system hd560 showed a large flare .",
    "the complete lightcurve is shown in fig .",
    "1 . next to the large outburst ( around jd 2448814.4 ) an increase of the count rate",
    "is observed from the 2nd and 3rd data interval in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc_hd560 ] .",
    "since the count rate just before the eruption of the flare is about the same as that of the 3rd data interval , we suppose that between the 3rd and 5th data interval we see the quiescent emission .",
    "however , due to poor data sampling it is unknown for how long the emission indeed remained stable at this level . the strong variability besides the large flare might also reflect rotational modulation as a result of a spot on the surface of one of the companions in the binary , or it could be some kind of orbital effect .    with a binary separation of @xmath18 the system is not resolved in both pspc observations .",
    "late - b type stars are not expected to produce x - rays because they lack both convective envelope ( necessary for solar - type dynamo activity ) and strong stellar winds ( providing hot , shocked gas ) . however , in earlier studies ( schmitt et  al .",
    "1993 , hulamo et  al .",
    "2000 ) x - rays were observed from both stars in those lindroos pairs that were resolved by the _",
    "rosat _ hri .",
    "while the typical @xmath20 ratio for late - type stars is @xmath21 , early - type stars are characterized by @xmath22 .",
    "hulamo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found that late - b type stars show intermediate @xmath23 values , but the hardness ratio is similar to that of late - type stars , suggesting unresolved companions . in the case of hd560",
    "we derive @xmath24 using the bolometric luminosity of the primary .",
    "therefore it is likely that the late - type component is the x - ray source , and , although we can not exclude the opposite case , we assume that the flare occurred on the g5 dwarf star .",
    "we have used the count - to - energy conversion factor of @xmath25 ( neuhuser et al .",
    "1995 ) to compute the x - ray luminosity . for",
    "the _ hipparcos _ distance of @xmath26pc the maximum count rate observed corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath27 .",
    "the luminosity derived for the quiescent count rate is @xmath28 .",
    "we note , that an estimate of the possible contribution from the early - type primary to the quiescent emission is impossible .",
    "therefore , for the evaluation of the flare luminosity , @xmath29 , we have studied two different cases : ( a ) all x - rays ( during quiescence and during the flare ) come from the late - type component , and ( b ) both stars in the binary system contribute the same level to the quiescent emission , but the additional emission during the flare is only due to the late - type star .",
    "for these two cases we have found the following values for the flare luminosity :    \\(a ) @xmath30    \\(b ) @xmath31    no data is available for both rise and decay phase of the flare event .",
    "we chose 400s for the binsize of the lightcurve displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc_hd560 ] .",
    "this is the best choice for the bin time given the satellite orbit wobble , and in order to achieve good s / n in each bin and high time resolution .",
    "furthermore , we find that choosing finer time resolution does not improve our knowledge about the temporal development of the intensity . due to the incomplete data sampling during the flare we can give only upper limits for both rise and decay timescales : @xmath32 and @xmath33",
    ".    the time evolution of the pspc hardness ratio @xmath34 is displayed in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lc_hd560 ] .",
    "@xmath34 seems to increase during the flare .",
    "however , the data are not conclusive in this respect due to low statistics . to verify whether the source really hardened during the flare event , we have extracted x - ray spectra for two time intervals representing the non - flaring state ( pre- and post- flare data ) and the flare ( data interval # 6 ) .",
    "spectral models for thermal emission from a hot , optically thin plasma ( rs - model ; raymond & smith 1977 ) plus a photo - absorption term are used to describe the spectra of both states .",

    "one - temperature ( 1-t ) models with solar abundance do not lead to acceptable fits ( @xmath57 for both flare and quiescent data ) .",
    "the f - test reveals that the significance of the improvement of the fit when the second temperature component is introduced is higher than 0.99 . only if the abundance is allowed to vary during the fitting process the quality of the fit is comparable to that of the 2-t models with fixed abundance . in all cases",
    "the column density @xmath58 was held fixed at @xmath59 ( berghfer et al .",
    "1996 ) . in table",
    "[ tab : specfits ] the best fit parameters from the 1-t model with free abundance are compared to the result of the 2-t model with fixed abundance for both quiescent and flare spectra . in the 1-t model only a marginal temperature increase during the flare is observed despite the increase in spectral hardness ( see fig .",

    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contours ] .",
    "while the uncertainties make flare and quiescent state undistinguishable concerning @xmath60 of the cooler component , the higher of the two temperatures is clearly representing the plasma heated during the flare .",
    "we have presented a large x - ray flare from the lindroos binary system hd560 observed with the _ rosat _ pspc .",
    "earlier observations of a flare by _",
    "exosat _ had been reported , but left the identification with hd560 ambiguous due to the lack of spatial resolution of the medium energy experiment .",
    "the maximum x - ray luminosity during the _ rosat _ flare corresponds to @xmath61erg / s , a value typical for young late - type stars .",
    "we have computed the bolometric luminosity for the g and the b star in hd560 from the v magnitudes ( lindroos 1985 ) and the bolometric correction listed by schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) . using the observed quiescent emission we derive the ratio of x - ray to bolometric luminosity @xmath62for primary and secondary : @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the latter value agrees well with the ` canonical ' value of @xmath21 for late - type stars , while the value for the primary is neither typical for late - type nor for early - type stars .",
    "therefore , supposedly , the flare has erupted on the g5 component of the system . however , the binary is unresolved , and it can not be ruled out that the flare originated on the b9 star . whether or not late - b type stars emit x - rays is an unsolved problem .",
    "we have analysed x - ray spectra for both the quiescent and the flare phase , and find acceptable fits for both phases with a two - temperature raymond - smith model . during the flare the higher temperature showed an increase with respect to the quiescent stage , while the lower temperature remained unaffected .",
    "a one - temperature model with free abundance provides fits of comparable quality .",
    "however , the rather similar temperature derived for the flare and the quiescent state with the one - temperature model is difficult to reconcile with coronal heating expected during flare outburst .",
