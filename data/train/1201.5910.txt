    "we now consider the in - phase component . if function @xmath264 were single - valued and smooth , @xmath265 , in the limit of small modulation amplitude @xmath266 we would have @xmath267 , which gives @xmath268 .",
    "then @xmath269 goes to zero on the both sides of the absorption peak .",
    "the behavior of @xmath242 becomes different in the presence of the hysteresis loop .",
    "we assume that the direction of sweeping @xmath176 is such that we move along the low - absorption branch and jump to the high - absorption branch , that is , in our system , we increase @xmath176 . in the limit @xmath266 ( in particular , @xmath270 )",
    ", we have @xmath271 on the low - absorption branch @xmath231 , i.e. , for @xmath272 .",

    "the offset @xmath280 on the high-@xmath176 side is given by the height of the jump of the absorption coefficient , @xmath281 .",
    "such offset is a characteristic feature of the hysteresis .",
    "it sensitively depends on the interrelation between the modulation amplitude and the width of the hysteresis loop.@xcite    we now discuss the case where the modulation range @xmath282 exceeds the width of the hysteresis region and assume that this region is narrow . to the leading order in @xmath283 and in @xmath175 , for @xmath284 we have @xmath285 $ ] , where the values of @xmath286 are given by equations",

    "the offset smoothly approaches the small-@xmath175 value @xmath297 , which applies to the leading order in @xmath175 for @xmath298 .",
    "the reduction in offset compared to the small-@xmath175 limit is easy to understand , since going round the hysteresis loop for @xmath299 the system samples both absorption branches in each modulation cycle . both theoretically and experimentally , the overall negative offset increases with increasing microwave power , as both the height of the absorption jump @xmath300 and the width of the hysteresis loop increase .",
    "this paper describes the theory and the experimental observation of the long - sought intrinsic optical bistability and hysteresis in a quasi two - dimensional electron system .",
    "the effect is a result of strong electron correlations and the hierarchy of the relaxation times , where the electron - electron momentum and energy exchange is the fastest process , followed by a much slower momentum relaxation due to scattering by the random short - range potential of ripplons or helium vapor atoms , followed by still much slower energy relaxation due to electron energy exchange with the environment . as a result of this hierarchy",
    ", a moderately strong resonant excitation of the transitions @xmath120 between the lowest subbands of motion normal to the surface leads to redistribution of the electrons over the subbands .",
    "this causes absorption bleaching due to depletion of the lowest electron subband .",
    "it occurs for much smaller power than that required for absorption saturation .    because of the electron - electron interaction , the redistribution of the electrons over the subbands leads to a change of the frequency @xmath129 of the @xmath120 transition .",
    "this causes bistability of the irradiated system . for a given radiation frequency @xmath64",
    "the frequency @xmath129 can be  tuned \" close to @xmath64 as a result of relatively strong electron population of excited subbands .",
    "then absorption is indeed strong and the excited subband population is self - consistently significant .",
    "alternatively , the resonance can be not that good , the electrons absorption is not that strong , the electrons mostly stay in the lowest subband , and @xmath129 is self - consistently detuned from @xmath64 .",
    "the developed microscopic theory of the many - electron system provides a full account of this behavior .",
    "experimentally , for electrons on @xmath1he we observed hysteresis of microwave absorption .",
    "the observation was made by measuring the magnetoconductivity in the corbino geometry .",
    "the data refer to the regime of strong electron correlations .",
    "different temperatures were studied , which made it possible to investigate the scattering primarily by the helium vapor atoms and by ripplons .",
    "the data for different radiation power show the increase of the hysteresis loop with the power . a quantitative agreement is obtained between the data and the theory of the electron - electron interaction induced change of @xmath129 as function of the electron temperature .",
    "we have also observed absorption hysteresis by directly measuring the transmitted microwave power near the resonant frequency @xmath129 , which is modulated though the applied holding field .",
    "the hysteresis is manifested as a characteristic offset of the integrated lineshape in the in - phase component of the modulated response and by a distinctive quadrature component at finite modulation amplitude .",
    "the results of this paper provide a new insight into the role of the electron - electron interaction in strongly correlated systems and present new types of resonant nonlinear phenomena in quasi two - dimensional electron systems .",
