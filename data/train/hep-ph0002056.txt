    "the 1s width of the @xmath15 atom @xcite determines @xmath16 and assuming isospin symmetry this gives @xmath17 and @xmath18 using @xcite @xmath9= -1.077(47 ) mb .",

    "this is the coherent sum of the @xmath2 scattering lengths from the proton and neutron , which , assuming charge symmetry ( viz , @xmath29 ) is the term required in our robust relation  ( [ eq : gmorobust ] ) the strong cancellation between the two terms is then done by the physics . in order to match the precision using the width , we only need a theoretical precision in the description of the deuteron scattering length to about 30% .",

    "this coupling constant which agrees quite well with the text book value , 14.28(18 ) @xcite is intermediate between the low value deduced from the large data banks of nn and @xmath7n scattering data @xcite and the high value from np charge exchange cross sections @xcite .",
