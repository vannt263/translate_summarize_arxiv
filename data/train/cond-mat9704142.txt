    "the blume - emery - griffiths ( beg ) @xcite model has been successfully applied to explain the behavior of different physical systems such as he@xmath0-he@xmath1 mixtures , microemulsions , semiconductor alloys , to quote only a few . in this paper",
    "we investigate the effect of quenched disorder on the mean field phase diagram of a version of the beg model in which orientational and particle degrees of freedom are explicitly introduced .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian : @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 ; the bilinear couplings @xmath5 are quenched gaussian random variables with average @xmath6 and variance @xmath7 , and the sign of biquadratic interaction may be negative .",
    "this hamiltonian represents a general framework to study the complex behavior of many physical systems . in the simple case of pure systems it describes , for example , a fluid model with magnetic properties like those of polar liquids , which exhibits multiple exotic phase diagrams @xcite . in presence of quenched disorder",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) implements different models whose rich phase diagrams are not yet fully explored .",
    "some limiting cases include the standard ising spin glass @xcite ( @xmath8 ; @xmath9 ) and the ghatak - sherrington model @xcite ( @xmath10 ) . in the particular case of @xmath11",
    "we recover the frustrated ising lattice gas @xcite that is a version of the _ frustrated percolation _",
    "model @xcite , whose properties suggest a possible close connection with the theories of _ structural glasses _ @xcite .",
    "essentially , the model considers a lattice gas in a frustrated medium where the particles have an internal degree of freedom ( given by its spin ) that accounts , for example , for possible orientations of complex molecules in glass forming liquids .",
    "these steric effects are greatly responsible for the geometric frustration appearing in glass forming systems at low temperatures or high densities .",
    "besides that , the particles interact through a potential that may be attractive or repulsive depending on the value of @xmath12 .    here",
    "we try to further elucidate the phase diagram properties of hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) within a replica mean field theory approach .",
    "specifically , the presence of disorder in the bilinear term leads to the appearance of a transition from a paramagnetic to a spin glass phase at low temperature or high density . when the biquadratic interaction is attractive or weakly repulsive we found , accordingly with the value of density , two spin glass transitions of different nature separated by a tricritical line : at high density the transition is continuous while at sufficiently low density the transition becomes discontinuous .",
    "when the particle repulsion is rather strong two new phases with a sub - lattice structure may appear : an antiquadrupolar phase and at lower temperatures , an antiquadrupolar spin glass phase .",
    "the antiquadrupolar spin glass transition line is always continuous whatever is the value of the chemical potential .",
    "when the bond weights are not symmetrically distributed , a ferromagnetic phase ( as well as a ferrimagnetic one , depending on the value of @xmath13 ) may appear in the phase diagram .",
    "one can also identify a line where a dynamical instability appears , as in spin glass models with discontinuous transition like the potts glass @xcite and the @xmath14-spin model @xcite . moreover , preliminary results on the stability analysis indicates the presence of a transition line from a ` phase ' with one to a ` phase ' with infinity replica symmetry breaking .",
    "this rich scenario and the unification picture provided by the model are the main motivations of this paper .",
    "many general properties of the phase diagram of hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) may be observed by simply studying the replica symmetric solutions of the mean - field equations . in the following paragraphs",
    "we discuss how the many thermodynamic phases appear when the parameters of hamiltonian  ( [ h ] ) are changed .    for the sake of clarity we work out separately the cases of attractive , @xmath15 , and repulsive , @xmath16 ,",
    "biquadratic interaction .",
    "using the replica method the free energy can be computed as : @xmath17_{av }   { \\;\\;,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the numbers of replicas and @xmath19_{av}$ ] denotes the average over the disorder .",
    "we obtain : @xmath20 { \\;\\;,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the single site partition function : @xmath22",
    "n^a   \\right\\ }   { \\;\\;,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the order parameters : density ( @xmath23 ) , magnetization ( @xmath24 ) , and parisi overlap ( @xmath25 ) , are defined as @xmath26 in the replica symmetric approximation , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , one finds : @xmath30   { \\;\\;,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the standard gaussian measure and we define : @xmath32 the order parameters satisfy the saddle point equations : @xmath33 ^ 2 }   { \\;\\;,}\\\\ m & = & \\int{{\\cal d}z\\:}\\frac{\\sinh(\\beta jz \\sqrt{q } + \\beta j_0 m ) } { { \\mbox{e}}^{-\\xi }        + \\cosh(\\beta j z \\sqrt{q } + \\beta j_0 m ) }    { \\;\\;.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that with a suitable transformation of our parameters ( @xmath34 ) we recover the equations obtained using spin-1 variables .",
    "the simplest case in this situation corresponds to a zero disordered average , @xmath35 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ pdmanyk ] , where the phase diagrams in the plane @xmath36 are depicted for several @xmath12 , at low temperatures or high values of the chemical potential ( high densities ) , there is a phase transition from a paramagnetic ( @xmath37 ; @xmath38 ) to a spin glass ( @xmath39 ; @xmath40 ) phase . for positive values of @xmath12 ( and @xmath35 ) , these are the only phases allowed to the system .",
    "they are separated by a continuous transition up to a tricritical point , @xmath41 , below which a discontinuous transition is observed .",
    "we just note that the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model with its critical temperature @xmath42 is recovered in two limits , both giving the highest possible density ( @xmath43 ) : @xmath8 or @xmath44 .",
    "we locate the continuous transition by expanding the saddle point equations for small values of @xmath45 , what leads to @xmath46 this equation is valid up to the tricritical point that may be located by expanding the single site partition function around the transition line where @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "this leads to : @xmath49 for instance , if @xmath50 we get @xmath51 and @xmath52@xcite .",
    "the line @xmath53 is also shown in fig .  [ pdmanyk ] .",
    "the exploration of our equations in the @xmath54 limit offers a simple tool to understand the subtle properties of the phase diagrams reported above .",
    "moreover , remembering that our model shares features with the frustrated percolation where no frustrated loops may be closed , it is interesting to study the behavior of the density @xmath55 at @xmath54 .",
    "this behavior is depicted in fig .",
    "[ dt0 ] . at @xmath54",
    "the saddle point equations become : @xmath56   { \\;\\;,}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 and : @xmath58     { \\;\\;.}\\ ] ] actually , @xmath55 satisfies these equations up to @xmath59 given by @xmath60 below which the close packing configuration is never achieved ( @xmath61 ) ; above @xmath59 , @xmath43 and @xmath62 .",
    "the point @xmath59 ( see fig .  [ dt0 ] ) individuates a clear cusp in the behavior of @xmath63 and seems to be a characteristic value for the system .",
    "we also observe that for high values of @xmath12 , @xmath64 , the region with @xmath65 disappears .    from the tricritical point",
    "other two lines depart in the plane @xmath66 ( see fig.[pdmanyk ] ) .",
    "they correspond to a thermodynamic line of discontinuous transitions from a paramagnetic to a sg phase , located where the free energy of the paramagnetic and spin glass solution are equal ; and a purely dynamical transition line whose presence is due to the large number of tap metastable states @xcite which can trap the system for very long times ( infinite time in the mean field model ) @xcite .",
    "the study of this metastable glassy states within a suitable generalization of the tap approach to the present model is in progress @xcite .    in order to identify the dynamical transition line",
    "we should compute the smallest eigenvalue ( replicon ) of the 1rsb stability matrix and impose the marginality condition @xcite . an alternative procedure amounts to expand the 1rsb free energy ( see appendix ) around the point @xmath67 , where @xmath68 denotes here the size of diagonal blocks in the parisi ansatz @xcite . however at level of the approximation we work ( replica symmetry )",
    "we can guess that the dynamical transition line is located near the line where a non zero solution of replica symmetric saddle point equations first appears ; however , to check this point a more detailed investigation will be need .",
    "when the temperature and chemical potential are close enough to the discontinuous transition line we expect that the glassy phase of the system is exactly described by only one step of replica symmetry breaking @xcite . on the other hand , when @xmath8 ( the sk model ) , the full rsb scheme , with infinite steps , is needed in order to obtain the correct answer .",
    "thus , a further ` replica transition line ' from a sg phase with one ( or finite ) replica symmetry breaking level to a sg phase with infinite levels of replica breaking is expected to start at the tricritical point and terminate on the @xmath54 axis in some characteristic point , probably near @xmath59 .",
    "this transition line is expected to separate qualitatively different _ aging _ behaviors of the system @xcite .",
    "we can also apply a magnetic field to the system by including a term like @xmath69 to the hamiltonian eq.([h ] ) ( this is done by adding the term @xmath70 to the argument of the hyperbolic functions in the saddle point equations ) .",
    "the continuous transition is destroyed as soon as @xmath71 and the first order transition ends in a critical point , the system presenting the characteristic wing shaped phase diagram .",
    "the effects of a magnetic field , as well as the stability of the rs solution in its presence were extensively studied for the ghatak - sherrington model @xcite .",
    "having given some details for the case @xmath35 , we face below the more general situation when @xmath13 is different from zero @xcite",
    ". there are now three kind of phases ( see fig.[j0km1m0 ] ) : a paramagnetic and a spin glass phase with essentially the same characteristics we have discussed above , along with a ferromagnetic phase ( @xmath73 ; @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) which appears , as usual , in the low temperature region ( or high @xmath76 ) when @xmath77 . as in the sk model , this ferromagnetic phase is reentrant ( in rs ) , although here the degree of reentrance may vary .    when the transitions between these phases are continuous ( _ e.g. _ , fig.[j0km1m0 ] ) , the boundary lines may be analytically obtained .",
    "the boundary between @xmath73 and @xmath37 is given by @xmath78 while the boundary between @xmath39 and @xmath73 obeys @xmath79 where @xmath55 and @xmath45 are obtained solving the saddle point equations with @xmath80 .",
    "and the boundary between @xmath39 and @xmath37 is our former result eq.([continuoustc ] ) .",
    "notice that in the limit @xmath76 ( or @xmath12)@xmath81 , we recover the sk boundaries ( @xmath82 for @xmath39-@xmath37 , @xmath83 for @xmath73-@xmath37 and @xmath84 for @xmath39-@xmath73 ) .",
    "changing the value of the chemical potential the transitions may become discontinuous , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ j0km1m06 ] for @xmath85 and @xmath11 , where a tricritical point and an endpoint show up .    as usual",
    "the analysis at @xmath54 is interesting . in this limit",
    "we get the following equations : @xmath86 and @xmath87 \\nonumber \\\\     & & \\cosh\\left[- \\frac{j_0m}{d}\\left ( \\frac{c}{2}+kd+\\frac{\\mu}{j }      \\right)\\right ]   { \\;\\;,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we can then individuate the location of the continuous transition line , in the plane @xmath88 , between the @xmath73 and @xmath39 phases .",
    "it occurs where @xmath89 so , expanding the above equation in @xmath68 , we get : @xmath90     { \\;\\;.}\\ ] ] here @xmath55 and @xmath91 are evaluated in the points where @xmath80 .",
    "this equation is valid up to a given @xmath92 ( note that since @xmath80 on this transition line , we just recover our former result ) and above this value , we find @xmath93 .    as is well known in the sk model , when @xmath13 grows too much , the sg phase disappears .",
    "a similar phenomenon happens here , but the order of the transition between the phases @xmath73 and @xmath37 depends on the value of @xmath76 , as expected .",
    "notice that we are considering @xmath11 , but in the next section we will show that for this value there are no antiquadrupolar ( glassy or not ) phases and the characteristics presented here are also general for greater values of @xmath12 .",
    "we expect that for negative values of @xmath12 or @xmath13 , there is also the possibility of having ferr_i_magnetic or anti - ferr_o_magnetic ordering , respectively .",
    "the former is characterized by having different magnetizations in the sublattices ( @xmath94 ) and the latter by having opposite magnetizations ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "the analysis of these phases is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "because the sign of the biquadratic coupling is now negative we have to take into account the possibility of further phase ordering within a two sub - lattice structure .",
    "this for instance is the case studied in refs .",
    "@xcite in absence of quenched disorder and in ref.@xcite but only for @xmath96 .",
    "when @xmath8 we recover the anti - ferromagnetic sherrington - kirkpatrick model , studied in ref.@xcite , and following their prescription , the hamiltonian can be rewritten as : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the index of the two sub - lattices . using the replica method we obtain the following free energy : @xmath99   { \\;\\;,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 ( @xmath98 ) is the single site partition function of the sub - lattice @xmath101 : @xmath102 n^a   \\right\\ }    { \\;\\;.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the replica symmetric approximation the free energy can be easily computed : @xmath103 { \\;\\;,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath104 from the free energy , one derives the replica symmetric saddle point equations : @xmath105 ^ 2 } { \\;\\;,}\\\\              m_a & = & \\int{{\\cal d}z\\:}\\frac{\\sinh(\\beta jz \\sqrt{q_b } + \\beta j_0 m_b ) } { { \\mbox{e}}^{-{\\xi}_b }      + \\cosh(\\beta j z \\sqrt{q_b } + \\beta j_0m_b ) }   { \\;\\;.}\\ ] ] the analogous equations for @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 are obtained from the previous one exchanging @xmath109 .",
    "a representative case is shown in fig .",
    "[ qdsotto ] where both @xmath110 and @xmath111 are presented in the @xmath39 and @xmath112 phases ( see definitions below ) .",
    "as stated above , new different phases emerge here . at high temperatures ( or low @xmath76 ) , when the orientational degrees of freedom are not interacting ( @xmath113 ) , there are two possible orderings : a paramagnetic ( or quadrupolar ) phase , @xmath37 , with @xmath114 and an antiquadrupolar one , @xmath115 , with @xmath116 .",
    "the name quadrupolar is reminiscent from the spin-1 representation ( @xmath117 ) where it labels the ordering of variables @xmath118 . at low temperatures ( or high @xmath76 ) , the orientational degrees of freedom become important and different glassy phases show up .",
    "first , there is a spin glass phase ( @xmath39 ) with @xmath119 and @xmath120 ) .",
    "this is the only glassy phase if the effects of particle repulsion are not very strong ( @xmath12 not too negative ) . on the other side ,",
    "when @xmath12 is highly negative , besides the @xmath39 phase , there is also an antiquadrupolar glass phase , @xmath112 , where the sub - lattice symmetry is broken ( @xmath116 , @xmath121 ) .    as in the previous section ,",
    "when @xmath13 is allowed to be nonzero , the system develops a magnetization and additional , ordered phases may appear : when @xmath77 at low temperatures ( or high @xmath76 ) a ferromagnetic phase ( @xmath73 ; @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 ) is encountered if @xmath12 is not too negative , or either a ferrimagnetic phase is entered ( @xmath125 ; @xmath94 , @xmath126 , @xmath121 ) .",
    "also , with @xmath127 , an anti - ferromagnetic phase ( @xmath128 ) may shows up .    from now on",
    "we consider @xmath35 . as we decrease @xmath12 from a positive value",
    ", there is a point , @xmath129 , where the @xmath112 phase first appears , growing inside the previously described @xmath39 phase ( see fig .",
    "[ pdkm2 ] ) . at a characteristic value ,",
    "@xmath130 , an antiquadrupolar phase appears between the paramagnetic , the @xmath39 and the @xmath112 phases , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ pdkm3 ] .",

    "[ pdkm3 ] ) , given by @xmath131 when both are equal , we get @xmath132 .",
    "as soon as the @xmath115 phase appears , the @xmath39 phase is divided in two regions . at even lower values of @xmath12 ( see fig .  [ pdkm5 ] ) , the @xmath115 grows , while the left @xmath39 phase shrinks and the right one moves to higher values of @xmath76 .",
    "this @xmath39 phase disappears as @xmath133 .",
    "we can also notice that the @xmath112 phase is invaded by the @xmath115 as we approach this limit , and eventually we have only the @xmath37 and @xmath115 phases , as we could expect since in this limit we have a lattice gas with repulsive interactions .    with the same techniques adopted in the previous paragraph",
    ", we can analytically locate the @xmath37-@xmath115 continuous transition line reported in figs .",

    "the stability of the solutions presented here can be studied by evaluating the eigenvalues of the matrix of gaussian fluctuations .",
    "the eigenvalues structure is analogous to the one found in the sk model @xcite with non zero magnetic field since here the chemical potential plays a similar role @xcite .",
    "however , in this case the eigenvalues may be negative or even complex @xcite .",
    "the numerical study of their behavior @xcite shows that the paramagnetic and antiquadrupolar phases are inside the stability region while both glass phases ( @xmath112 and @xmath39 ) are unstable .",
    "the critical line @xmath37-@xmath115 , @xmath37-@xmath39 and @xmath115-@xmath112 are found to be in the stability region , their location depending on the chemical potential , and should not change when replica symmetry is broken ; while the transition line @xmath112-@xmath39 is found to be completely inside the instability region and its precise location , beyond the aims of this paper , may be found only within the parisi scheme of rsb .",
    "we have studied the global phase diagram of a spin glass version of the blume - emery - griffiths model where the bilinear couplings are quenched gaussian random variables .",
    "the particles , besides the steric effects due to complex molecular structure ( represented by the possible spin orientations ) , are subject to a potential that may be either attractive or repulsive .",
    "these steric effects that prevent close packing configuration are common in materials like glasses and poured sand .",
    "this model displays a large variety of interesting critical behaviors .",
    "when the particles interaction is attractive or weakly repulsive the transition between the paramagnetic and spin glass phase may be either continuous or discontinuous , depending on the value of the chemical potential ; these different behaviors are separated by a tricritical line . for strong repulsive interaction between particles , new different phases with a sub - lattice structure emerge : the antiquadrupolar and the antiquadrupolar glassy phase .",
    "these phases seems to be separated by a continuous transition whatever is the value of the chemical potential ( at least in the range of @xmath12 studied here ) .",
    "when the quenched disorder is not symmetrically distributed , also a ferromagnetic phase or a ferrimagnetic phase may appear in the phase diagram .    a further transition line where a dynamical instability appears",
    "may also be found as happens in other spin glass models with discontinuous transition . indeed ,",
    "many interesting properties emerge if we consider the _ dynamical _ behavior of systems whose equilibrium properties are described by hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) .",
    "for example , the model with diffusive particle dynamics shows strong glassy behavior characterized by diverging relaxation times , vanishing diffusivity and breakdown of the debye - stokes - einstein law @xcite ; while the spin-1 version of the model with monte carlo dynamics displays different aging regimes due to the existence of spin - glass transitions of different nature . in the region where the spin - glass transition is discontinuous",
    "the aging behavior is stable against non - relaxational perturbation @xcite and quite similar to the one observed in non - relaxational dynamics of the spherical @xmath14-spin glass model @xcite .",
    "furthermore when a gravitational term is added to the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) , strong links appears with granular media and their complex dynamical behavior as logarithmic compaction @xcite .",
