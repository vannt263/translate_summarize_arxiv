    "much effort has been devoted to correlate the underlying topological and geometrical properties of equipotential manifolds in phase space with the occurrence of a phase transition ( pt ) at a critical value of the energy @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "indeed , for a class of confining short - range potentials , very strong arguments support the proposal that a topology change of the configuration space should take place as the system undergoes a finite temperature pt @xcite .",
    "the signature of the referred topology change is expected to be printed in the topological invariants of the manifold , such us the euler characteristic @xmath0 ; besides , the arguments do not exclude mean field ( mf ) models .",
    "moreover , the relevance of the singularities associated with the stationary points ( critical points ) of the potential energy has been emphasized @xcite by the following condition : at a pt the density of jacobian s critical points diverges in the thermodynamic limit , or , by the same token , the determinant ( @xmath5 ) of the hessian matrix of the potential should be asymptotically flat at the transition .",
    "the two above - mentioned conditions were shown to be fulfilled in several mf models : @xmath1 and k - trigonometric @xcite ; @xmath1 on @xmath6 chains under frustration- or field - induced pt s @xcite ; and in a model of self - gravitating particles @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been proposed @xcite that in the mentioned models the following property holds : the simultaneous occurrence of the two necessary conditions , namely the @xmath5-flatness condition and the discontinuity or cusp - like pattern exhibited by @xmath0 at @xmath4 , emerges as a necessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of a finite temperature pt .",
    "however , it was shown @xcite that , contrary to previous results @xcite , the two - dimensional ( 2d ) short - range @xmath7 model with o(1 ) symmetry , which is in the same universality class of the 2d ising model , violates the theorem proposed in @xcite : neither the transition at @xmath4 is printed in the euler characteristic nor the hessian determinant is flat ; similar results have been found in numerical simulations of the 2d- and 3d short - range @xmath1 models @xcite .",
    "very recently , this counterexample was circumvented by an extension @xcite of the first version of the theorem @xcite .",
    "in fact , it was shown @xcite that the phase transition of the @xmath8 model stems from an asymptotic ( @xmath9 ) change of topology of the energy level sets , in spite of the absence of critical points of the potential energy corresponding to a pt .",
    "therefore , the main idea underlying the topological hypothesis is preserved : a pt might correspond to a change in the topology of the manifolds whose geodesics define the motions of the system @xcite .",
    "we also mention that for discrete models , such as the 1d @xcite and 2d- ising and @xmath10 potts @xcite models , topological arguments can also contribute to the understanding of the thermodynamic pt of the model @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we shall extend the above - mentioned ideas and propose a topological approach to establish a connection between thermodynamics and the topology of configuration space .",
    "indeed , we shall report on results that point to the possibility of using only topology arguments in order to describe the microcanonical thermodynamics of _ interacting classical spins _ in the thermodynamic limit , including the occurrence of a pt .",
    "our approach relies on morse theory @xcite , through the determination of the critical points of the potential energy , which is the proper morse function .",
    "our main finding is to show that , in the context of the studied classical spin models , the euler characteristic embeds the necessary features for a correct description of magnetic quantities , such as the magnetization , susceptibility , and critical temperature . despite the classical nature of the studied models , such quantities are those that do not violate the laws of thermodynamics ( with the proviso that van der waals loop states are mean field artifacts ) .",
    "we also discuss the subtle connection between our approach using the euler entropy , defined by the logarithm of the modulus of @xmath0 per site , and that using the boltzmann microcanonical entropy .",
    "the reliability of our approach is tested in two systems exactly soluble by standard methods of statistical mechanics : the mf - xy and the 1d short - range xy models .",
    "the problem of geometrical and topological properties of the microcanonical entropy associated with a standard classical hamiltonian with many degrees of freedom @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 , has been undertaken in detail in [ 1 ] .",
    "in particular , it has been established that a singular behavior of thermodynamic observables is originated only from a contribution of topological origin .",
    "these studies gave rise to the so - called _ topological hypothesis _",
    ", which suggests a change of the measure and topology of the equipotential manifold during a phase transition .",
    "in fact , it was suggested that the boltzmann entropy per independent degree of freedom ( large @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 , could possibly be approximated by the addition of a topological contribution and a smooth function of @xmath16 , in the following alternative forms @xcite : @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the total number of critical points lying in @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the euler characteristic , @xmath23 is the morse number , which counts how many critical points of index @xmath24 lie in @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is analytical ( or at least @xmath27 ) around the transition point .",
    "notice that , while ( [ eq::approxentbync ] ) does not seem to present any mathematical inconsistency as an entropy , the fact that the euler characteristic of the associated equipotential manifold could be zero in some cases deserves special care , and will be discussed in section ii.b .",
    "we remark that , since @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the constant - energy hypersurface in the @xmath30-dimensional phase space , the derivation @xcite of the approximants for the entropy in ( [ eq::approxentbync ] ) and ( [ eq::approxentbychi ] ) were made using the gauss - bonnet - hopf theorem and a complementary result due to chern and lashof : @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , where @xmath33 is an @xmath34-dimensional sphere of unit radius , @xmath35 is the gauss - kronecker curvature of @xmath29 , and @xmath36 is the @xmath24-th betti number of @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , it is argued that , for large @xmath37 , @xmath29 concentrates on @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and also that @xmath41 .",
    "in fact , an alternative derivation of ( [ eq::approxentbync ] ) @xcite is to use the condition valid for `` normal '' systems in the sense of statistical thermodynamics @xcite , namely that the boltzmann entropy is well approximated by the logarithm of the total number of microscopic states @xmath42 : @xmath43 we also emphasize that ( [ eq::approxentbync ] ) was derived using mathematical arguments that avoid critical points , i.e. , only points in energy intervals between critical values of @xmath44 are considered .",
    "notwithstanding , it is argued that the disjoint union of all these open sets should define , for large @xmath37 , a good approximation for a smooth function , i.e. , the entropy @xcite .",
    "many authors took advantage of the expectation that the topology contribution should dominate the entropy around a finite - temperature phase transition @xcite .",
    "in fact , the computation of the first term in ( [ eq::approxentbync ] ) and ( [ eq::approxentbychi ] ) became an efficient means to validate the topological hypothesis , in which case the referred quantities exhibit a cuspid , or discontinuity , as the energy crosses the critical value @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , for the mf-@xmath1 model in a field the ferromagnet transition is absent , thereby leading to a monotonically decreasing contribution of the euler characteristic to the entropy for @xmath45 , i.e. , @xmath46 , while the contribution of the total number of critical points saturates , i.e. , @xmath47 , where [ notice that in [ 1 ] @xmath48 @xmath49 in short , in the thermodynamic limit , the two referred contributions are identical for @xmath50 , monotonically increasing functions of the energy , and bona - fide contribution to the entropy , whereas for @xmath51 they differ drastically and claims for a careful interpretation .      here , we shall built on these ideas and results to propose a topological approach that appears suitable to describe the thermodynamics and phase transition of _ interacting classical spins _ .",
    "these models are a restricted set of classical systems , since their hamiltonian is defined by the spin interaction potential only , without any sort of kinetic term .",
    "notwithstanding , as shown below , it is gratifying that some soluble models that have been used to test the topological hypothesis , such as the mf - xy model @xcite , 1d @xmath1 short - range model @xcite , and the k - trigonometric model @xcite , do belong to this class of models and can be successfully analyzed within our framework .",
    "our topological approach is based on the integration with respect to euler characteristic , the @xmath52-integral , as proposed by viro @xcite and schapira @xcite , and corresponds to an analytical interpretation of the classical euler characteristic . despite that in the referred proposal @xcite , the euler characteristic as a measure has been devised in a context distinct from that of differentiable manifolds , a morse - theoretic interpretation in the context of manifolds",
    "was given to the corresponding @xmath52-integral @xcite , and also applied to object enumerations in networks @xcite . in this work ,",
    "these ideas and methods are used in the context of equipotential manifolds associated with systems of interacting classical spins in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "_ euler integration _",
    "@xcite : let @xmath44 be a morse function in a @xmath37-dimensional manifold @xmath53",
    ". denote by @xmath54 the set of critical points @xmath55 of @xmath44 . for each @xmath55 the index , @xmath56 , is defined as the number of negative eigenvalues of the hessian of @xmath57 at @xmath55 .",
    "then , the integral of a function @xmath58 over @xmath53 with respect to the euler ( poincar ) characteristic , i.e. , the @xmath52-integral , is defined by @xmath59 which implies @xmath60 where the morse number @xmath61 counts how many critical points of index @xmath24 lie in @xmath62 ; and also @xmath63 the motivation to introduce @xmath64 will become clear below .",
    "the @xmath52-integral is the main mathematical concept underlying our topological approach ; we also emphasize that this integral is neither a riemann nor a lebesgue integral .",
    "it will prove very useful to define the euler entropy @xmath65 in analogy [ see also ( [ eq::approxentbync ] ) and ( [ eq::approxentbychi ] ) ] with the microcanonical boltzmann entropy related to @xmath44 ( @xmath66 ) : @xmath67 where @xmath68 in the above equation , @xmath69 is the thermodynamic weight , @xmath70 is the density of states , and @xmath64 is a small allowance in energy of no relevance in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath71 for classical systems ) @xcite .",
    "further , the analogy with the mean value of a thermodynamic quantity @xmath72 , defined by @xmath73 suggests that , in the @xmath52-integral context , @xmath74 reads : @xmath75 where in ( [ vm ] ) we emphasize that the degeneracy of the critical points must be properly considered .",
    "for example , in mf models the degeneracy is equal to the morse number , whereas for the short - range xy model the counting is a bit more complex .",
    "last , we introduce the euler temperature @xmath76 through the analogy @xmath77 in computing the thermodynamic temperature , we can make @xmath78 arbitrarily small .",
    "however , in computing @xmath79 , we should pay attention to the noncritical neck theorem @xcite , and therefore , we choose @xmath80 as the exact distance between neighboring critical values @xmath81 and @xmath82 , otherwise the euler characteristic would not change .",
    "this choice is adequate since we expect that the distance between neighboring critical points approaches zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this derivation process also applies to any @xmath83 topological invariant .",
    "we stress that @xmath79 is an intensive variable in the context of the topological approach .",
    "however , due to the classical nature of the models , the euler temperature is identical to the thermodynamic one only in some special limits : at @xmath84 and at @xmath85 .",
    "finally , in order to apply the techniques introduced in this section , some conditions should be satisfied .",
    "we believe that a minimal list of necessary requirements would be : ( i ) the critical levels of the potential @xmath44 are distributed along the same energy interval where the boltzmann entropy is defined ; and ( ii ) the distance between neighboring critical levels approaches zero as @xmath86 , i.e. , the set of these levels should be densely distributed in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "as previously mentioned in the introduction , the 2d short - range @xmath7 model with o(1 ) symmetry was shown @xcite to violate the necessity theorem proposed in @xcite : the transition at @xmath4 is not printed in the euler characteristic . from this , it is clear that our proposal does not apply to the 2d @xmath7 model , since condition ( i ) above is not satisfied .",
    "interestingly , we have noticed that other models , such as the mf @xmath7 model @xcite , the 1d peyrard - bishop model @xcite , and the burkhardt solid - on - solid model @xcite , where the behavior of the euler characteristic is in conflict with the topological hypothesis , have a common feature , namely the configuration space is non - compact .",
    "in fact , for all the models mentioned above , the configuration space is @xmath87 , which is clearly non - compact .",
    "whether the condition of compactness is the missing hypothesis in the necessity theorem @xcite is an open question .",
    "lastly , at the mf level , we remark that for all models satisfying the topological hypothesis , a consistent landau @xmath7 model near @xmath4 can be derived by requiring that the associated order parameter is small ( scaling region ) , with critical exponents obeying scaling relations .",
    "as previously stated , it is well known that for normal systems in the sense of statistical thermodynamics @xcite @xmath69 can be well approximated by @xmath42 . however , in ideal spin systems with an energy upper bound ( no positive unbounded kinetic energy term ) , high energy states may violate this condition and give rise to negative spin temperatures .",
    "recently , this feature raised some controversy @xcite and in the following we shall digress on this matter .    in an attempt to resolve the discrepancy between the results derived using the boltzmann entropy and @xmath42 [ for the referred classical models ] , in @xcite the authors suggested that the correct approach is the one using @xmath42 , thereby excluding the occurrence of states with negative spin temperature and replacing them by a state of infinite temperature in the entire high energy region associated with the saturation of @xmath42 .",
    "however , in this work we shall present statistical mechanics and topology arguments that point to the consistency of the boltzmann and euler entropies in the description of the _ magnetic _ properties of the infinite and short - range @xmath1 models , in which case a proper interpretation of negative spin temperature states is provided in the context of ideal interacting classical spin systems .",
    "some remarks are in order :    \\(i ) since , to the best of our knowledge , models suitable to a topological approach based on morse theory behave classically , some well known drawbacks due to the continuous energy spectrum may arise , particularly at low temperatures , thereby giving rise to results that might violate the laws of thermodynamics , such as a nonzero specific heat .",
    "most importantly , in the case of the studied @xmath1 models , the boltzmann entropy exhibits singular behavior as @xmath88 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the euler entropy is positive definite and , as such , it approaches zero as @xmath88 ( and the specific heat as well ) .",
    "remarkably , despite the referred subtleties due to the classical nature of the models , their magnetic properties , such as the mean magnetization , susceptibility , critical temperature , and correlation function ( short - range model ) , do not violate the laws of thermodynamics ( with the proviso that van der waals loop states are mean field artifacts ) and can be exactly calculated using _ either _ the boltzmann description of microcanonical thermodynamics or the topological approach based on the euler entropy and morse theory .",
    "\\(ii ) from the above discussion , it is clear that the classical nature of the models precludes the possibility of an equality between the boltzmann and euler entropies in the thermodynamic limit , as for the 1d ising model in a field @xcite , in which case the equality follows from the discrete symmetry of the model .",
    "in fact , using a topological procedure to study phase transitions that suits discrete models @xcite , it was shown that , in zero field , @xmath89 where the first and second terms are the per - site euler entropies of the 1d- short range @xmath1 and ising models , respectively , while the last one is the boltzmann entropy of the 1d ising model . moreover , there is no violation of the laws of thermodynamics at low temperatures , although the high - energy states do exhibit negative spin temperatures , which are formally mapped onto antiferromagnetic states at positive temperatures . this feature is also confirmed in this work , in the context of the mf and the 1d short - range @xmath1 models .",
    "\\(iii ) from a statistical mechanics viewpoint , the equivalence between the canonical and microcanonical ensembles implies the following relations in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath86 ) : @xmath90 and @xmath91 with @xmath92 defined in the complex plane and @xmath93 is the minimum energy of the system .",
    "it is well known that , for @xmath94 the use of saddle point techniques , in either of the two previous relations , enables us to derive the thermodynamic relation connecting both ensembles : @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the helmholtz free energy and the boltzmann entropy per degree of freedom @xcite , respectively .",
    "notwithstanding , here it is shown that in order to achieve a more complete understanding of the equivalence of ensembles in the context of the models , it is instructive to extend the domain of @xmath98 to negative spin temperatures and to search for the unstable and metastable solutions .",
    "we stress that negative spin temperature states , which are `` formally '' allowed only for systems with an energy upper bound and spins loosely coupled to the other degrees of freedom ( ideally uncoupled in our spin - only systems ) , were first considered in the context of experiments in nuclear spin systems @xcite , and subjected to an analysis of relevant aspects of their thermodynamics and statistical mechanics properties @xcite .",
    "a variety of models predicting states with negative temperatures has attracted continuous interest : anti - shielding effect and superluminal light propagation under reversed electric fields @xcite , cosmological model describing dark energy and supermassive black holes @xcite , unconfined quark - gluon plasma @xcite , decoherence @xcite , pts , metastability , entanglement in bipartite quantum systems @xcite , and optical lattices under parabolical potentials @xcite . however , it has been shown @xcite that states at negative _ absolute _ temperature ( @xmath99 ) are metastable and heat can flow irreversibly to a reservoir at an absolute positive temperature ( @xmath100 ) . in the experiments of purcell and pound",
    "@xcite the lattice plays the role of the @xmath100 reservoir , albeit the observed relaxation time is indeed much longer than those relaxation times for ordinary spin excited states .",
    "the referred metastability , or the lack of equilibrium @xmath99 states , is a result of the combination of ramsey s postulate of the second law of thermodynamics for @xmath99 states , with that of kelvin for @xmath100 states ; although both postulates agree with that of clausius : heat flows from a hot reservoir to a cold one .",
    "in fact , in the microcanonical ensemble , @xmath99 states appear as energy increases from the low - energy range to the high - energy one , i.e. , from cold to hot ; thereby the equivalence with the canonical ensemble would imply the following @xmath98-range : @xmath101 . despite that our main goal in this work",
    "is to establish the connection between statistical mechanics and topology in the context of the microcanonical ensemble of macroscopic systems in equilibrium , we remark that the extensive boltzmann entropy @xmath102 is the starting point in the study of the irreversible time evolution of macroscopic systems out of equilibrium @xcite , as well as in the microcanonical description of the thermodynamics and phase transitions in `` small '' systems @xcite . in this context",
    ", the case @xmath103 of the infinite - range @xmath1 model discussed in section iv is proved quite instructive .    in short , in the context of ideal spin - only systems , such as the ones studied in this work , the concept of negative spin temperature is a useful one in the analysis of high energy states , which , as for the 1d ising model in a field @xcite , are formally identified as antiferromangnetic states at positive spin temperature .",
    "therefore , with this proviso , the nature of the spin configuration states will be analyzed under the thermodynamic stability conditions related to the magnetization of the system only .",
    "\\(iv ) now we discuss the possibility of a vanishing value for the euler characteristic , that would lead to a singular euler entropy .",
    "it follows from the well known poincar duality theorem @xcite that under the assumptions of connectedness , orientability and closedness ( i.e. , compact and without boundary @xcite ) , the euler characteristic of an odd - dimensional manifold is zero .",
    "however , this result can not be applied to the sets used in our work , in the context of ( [ def::eulerchar_fatia ] ) and ( [ def::eulerchar ] ) , since @xmath21 and @xmath104 have boundaries and therefore the hypotheses of the theorem are not met .",
    "indeed , the hypothesis of closedness can not be omitted in our topological approach suitable to describe interacting classical spin systems exhibiting a pt .",
    "for example , if @xmath21 is obtained by the attachment of the minima points , i.e. when we pass the first critical value of @xmath44 , say @xmath105 , then @xmath106 since @xmath107 for @xmath108 and @xmath109 , regardless of the parity of the dimension @xmath37 .",
    "in addition , if one invokes an analogy with the density of states @xmath70 , in ( [ eq::pesotermo ] ) , then we would define @xmath110 through the euler characteristic of @xmath111 , where @xmath16 is a critical level of @xmath44 .",
    "these level sets are compact , have no boundary , and are of dimension @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , the application of the poincar duality theorem would imply @xmath113 for @xmath37 even .",
    "however , when @xmath16 is a critical level of @xmath44 , the set @xmath114 is not a manifold , since the neighborhood of a critical point @xmath115 is a degenerate quadric , which do not qualify as a manifold ( see page 255 of [ 1 ] ) . in this case",
    ", we believe that a proper way to calculate @xmath116 is to use @xmath104 and to take @xmath117 , in which case morse theory can be applied , as described in sections 2.1 , 2.4 , and 2.5 ( in particular , see the case @xmath103 discussed in section 4.1 ) .",
    "besides , we also remark that in the spin - only models analyzed so far @xcite , the euler characteristic does not vanish for critical energies in the interval @xmath118 , regardless the parity of @xmath37 .    in the next sections ,",
    "we shall focus on the use of the euler and the microcanonical boltzmann entropies , through ( [ equivbetweenentropyandschi ] ) and ( [ def::boltzentropy ] ) , in order to describe the thermodynamics and pt of the mf and the 1d short - range @xmath1 models .",
    "the results will allow us to comment on the connection between thermodynamics and topology , including subtle aspects that appear from the specific methodologies of the approaches and the classical nature of the models .",
    "we shall first use the above proposed topological approach to describe the infinite - range @xmath1 model in the presence of a field defined by the following potential energy of @xmath37 ferromagnetically coupled classical spin vectors of fixed length ( @xmath119 ) @xcite : @xmath120-h\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\cos\\theta_{i},\\ ] ] where @xmath121 , with @xmath122 being the position ( angle ) of the @xmath123-th spin with @xmath124 in the @xmath125 direction , i.e. , the @xmath125-axis of the chosen @xmath126 reference axes .",
    "in fact , due to the rotational invariance symmetry and infinite - range interactions of the model , the chosen axes and the spin positions are immaterial @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the magnetization , given by @xmath127 therefore , the potential energy per spin for a given configuration @xmath128 reads : @xmath129    the critical points of @xmath130 are obtained by solving the equation @xmath131 for which it is only pertinent to consider the solutions @xmath132 or @xmath133 , and @xmath134 ( rotational invariance ) , which correspond , in the thermodynamic limit , to all values of @xmath135 $ ] ; besides , the critical point @xmath136 is governed by an external continuous parameter ( the field @xmath124 conjugate to @xmath53 ) .",
    "however , for a fixed value of @xmath124 , some values of @xmath53 shall manifest more significantly , both in the thermodynamic description and in the @xmath52-topological approach .",
    "we shall thus consider the @xmath130 _ vs. _ @xmath53 curves , illustrated in figure 1(a ) for @xmath137 , and @xmath138 , in light of the special critical points discussed below . in zero field ,",
    "therefore , at the trivial critical point @xmath140 , @xmath141 attains the maximum value : @xmath142 ( magenta square ) , in which case both solutions @xmath132 and @xmath143 occur with equal probability at each site @xmath144 .",
    "further , at the critical point @xmath132 ( @xmath143 ) @xmath145 , i.e. , @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) , @xmath141 attains the minimum value : @xmath148 ( red triangles ) .",
    "however , in the presence of a field , @xmath149 ; hence , for @xmath150 ( @xmath151 ) @xmath152 attains the minimum value , @xmath153 ( red triangles ) , only at the critical point @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "further , for @xmath154 the maximum of @xmath152 is shifted to the critical point @xmath155 illustrated by the magenta dashed line and squares at distinct field values .",
    "last , for @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) , @xmath152 attains the maximum value @xmath158 at the critical point @xmath147 ( @xmath146 ) , illustrated by red squares .",
    "we also remark that for @xmath159 ( @xmath160 ) , @xmath147 ( @xmath146 ) is a critical point at which @xmath152 has the value @xmath161 ( curves without symbols at @xmath162 ) , which is neither a maximum nor a minimum value [ saddle point solutions in figures 3(b)-(d ) ] .",
    "the above analysis of the critical point solutions of @xmath152 , namely @xmath163 , and @xmath164 , will prove most relevant in the understanding of the thermodynamics and phase transition exhibited by the model , particularly in the topological context @xcite .",
    "the exact solution of the model in the canonical ensemble is obtained by the computation of the partition function , @xmath165 $ ] . performing the integration over the @xmath37 angular variables and using the saddle point method ( @xmath166 ) ,",
    "the free energy per particle , @xmath167 , reads @xcite : @xmath168,$ ] where @xmath169 is the @xmath170-order modified bessel function and @xmath171 is the solution of the saddle point self - consistency equation @xcite : @xmath172 with magnetization @xmath173 . in zero field ,",

    "indeed , by inverting ( [ micro_energy ] ) we find that @xmath181 which will be useful in our topological analysis .",
    "moreover , using  ( [ self_consist ] ) and ( [ micro_energy ] ) we can compute the diagrams @xmath53 _ vs. _ @xmath182 and @xmath53 _ vs. _ @xmath16 , as shown in figures @xmath183(b ) and ( c ) , respectively , for @xmath184 , and @xmath138 .",
    "let us now discuss the diagram @xmath53 _ vs. _ @xmath98 shown in figure 1(b ) . for @xmath185 , we find three sets of solutions to  ( [ self_consist ] ) @xcite .",
    "the first , with @xmath53 parallel ( antiparallel ) to @xmath124 for positive ( negative ) @xmath98 , corresponds to stable solutions , and are illustrated by full ( dotted ) lines in figure 1(b ) .",

    "the second set , with @xmath53 anti - parallel to @xmath124 and @xmath188 are metastable solutions , such that @xmath187 ( @xmath189 ) for positive ( negative ) @xmath124 , as shown for @xmath190 and @xmath191 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "these metastable solutions start at @xmath84 with @xmath162 ( red filled squares ) and only exist up to a maximum temperature , @xmath192 , defined by the singularity @xmath193 ( full balls ) .",
    "the third set of solutions , also with @xmath53 antiparallel to @xmath124 and @xmath188 , are unstable solutions , such that @xmath189 ( @xmath187 ) for positive ( negative ) @xmath124 .",
    "these unstable solutions , also illustrated by dashed lines , start at @xmath84 with @xmath136 ( filled squares ) and meet the metastable solutions at @xmath192 . in fact , the metastable and unstable solutions are the corresponding van der waals loops in the @xmath53 _ vs. _ @xmath98 diagram @xcite .",

    "our approach relies on morse theory , through the determination of the critical points of the potential energy , which is the proper morse function .",
    "our main finding is to show that , in the context of the studied exactly solvable classical models , the euler entropy @xmath233 , defined by the logarithm of the modulus of the euler characteristic per site , exhibits subtle connections with the boltzmann microcanonical entropy , and allows the exact computation of the magnetic properties , such as the magnetization , susceptibility , correlation function , and critical temperature , using the euler measure .",
    "further , in the mf case , the results suggest that the loss of regularity in the morse function is associated with the occurrence of unstable and metastable thermodynamic solutions .",

    "indeed , in the thermodynamic limit , in contrast to the entropy @xmath393 calculated as a sum of the morse numbers , which saturates for energies above the critical one , the predictions from both the boltzmann microcanonical entropy and the euler entropy are dominated by the multiplicity of the microscopy states at a _ fixed _ value of energy .",
    "therefore , unlike the description using the boltzmann and euler entropies , which allows for negative spin temperature states , the use of @xmath393 replaces these states by one of infinite temperature in the entire energy region where @xmath393 saturates , similarly to the behavior of @xmath42 in the region of high - energy states .",

    "in contrast to the mf case , the correct thermodynamic magnetization and critical temperature are obtained from both euler and @xmath243 entropies .",
    "this is so because , for the short - range xy model , @xmath553 .",
    "on the other hand , the approach using @xmath243 imposes an infinite temperature in the region @xmath602 , which gives rise to a zero value for the correlation function and the corresponding susceptibility as well .    in conclusion",
