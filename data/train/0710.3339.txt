    "in high energy research , heavy quarkonium physics is one of the most interesting fields and it plays an important role in understanding the hadron configuration and the microcosmos .",
    "theoretically , due to the non - relativistic nature of heavy quarknoia , it is convenient to research their properties in the framework of non - relativistic potential model and non - relativistic qcd @xcite , or other theories which work well in the non - relativistic limit . experimentally , heavy quarkonia have relatively high production rate in both electronic and hadronic collisions and the vector members can be easily seen through their bi - lepton decays .",
    "recently , some new resonances have been observed in the charmonium energy region @xcite , which enrich the heavy quarkonium spectroscopy and make heavy - quarkonium physics more interesting .",
    "after the spin - triplet bottomonium @xmath5 was discovered three decades ago , its pseudoscalar partner @xmath0 had been looked for in various experiments .",
    "unfortunately , there is still no conclusive evidence that this elusive particle has been found . as a solid prediction from the quark model ,",
    "the existence of @xmath0 is indubitable , but its mass and decay channels remain undetermined experimentally at the present time . to search @xmath0 ,",
    "several experiments have been conducted both in @xmath6 collisions at the cleo and the lep , and hadronic collisions at the fermilab tevtron .",
    "the advantage of @xmath6 collisions is its clear background , which is impaired by the fact that production rates for spin - singlet states are generally small .",
    "based on the 2.4 @xmath7 data taken at the @xmath8 and @xmath9 resonances , cleo has searched distinctive single photons from hindered @xmath10 transitions of @xmath8 and @xmath9 to @xmath11 , and also from the cascade decay @xmath12 followed by @xmath13 transition @xmath14 , but no signals have been found @xcite . in the experiments at lep ii , the @xmath15 is expected to be produced in two - photon process .",
    "the alpha collaborations analyzed the @xmath16 interaction data , but found no evident signal in the four- and six - charged - particle final states @xcite .",
    "the results of the l3 collaboration and the delphi collaboration were also negative and the upper limits of the products @xmath17 were set @xcite . in comparison to @xmath18 experiments ,",
    "the hadronic collision at the fermilab tevatron gives large @xmath0 production rate , but due to the complicated hadronic interaction background , the search for @xmath0 there is also hard . using the full 1992 - 96(run",
    "i ) data , the cdf collaboration searched the @xmath0 through its exclusive decay to double @xmath4 and found some oblique evidences , but far from conclusive @xcite . right now , further efforts is being pursued in the run ii data there .",
    "considering the situation of @xmath0 experiments , theoretical research on its properties is still necessary , such as its mass , the production cross - sections at different colliders , and its various decay channels . among all properties ,",
    "the @xmath0 mass is believed to be predicted by potential model , effective theory , and lattice calculation without much ambiguity , which is very important for experimental observation .",
    "recent theoretical work fixes the @xmath19 mass splitting in the range of @xmath20 mev @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , braaten , fleming and leibovich calculated the @xmath0 production cross section at the fermilab tevatron in the framework of nrqcd and evaluated the branching ratio of the decay @xmath21 .",
    "they suggested that @xmath0 should be observable through this decay because of its large branching ratio of @xmath22 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , maltoni and polosa also evaluated the observation potential for @xmath0 at the tevatron , but they found and suggested that the decay @xmath23 might be the most optimistic channel to observe @xmath0 signal . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the relativistic correction to the @xmath24 decay process was calculated and a much smaller branching ratio in comparison to ref .",
    "@xcite was obtained .",
    "the author also discussed the @xmath23 process and got a smaller rate than what in ref .",
    "however , santorelli finds that the final state interaction may enhance @xmath25 decay width by about two orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "instead of @xmath0 decays into hadronic final states , hao _",
    "_ calculated the branching ratio of the @xmath0 radiative decay process , i.e. @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "they claimed that this channel is also a hopeful one in the @xmath0 hunting .    comparing to the exclusive process",
    ", the inclusive process has a large branching ratio , nevertheless normally also has large uncertainties in pinning down the parent particle .",
    "fortunately , the final state distributions of experimental observables are helpful to the inclusive process for the aim . for instance ,",
    "recently , the inclusive charm production in the @xmath27 and @xmath5 decays have been studied in @xcite and @xcite respectively .    at the leading order in @xmath1 and non - relativistic expansion",
    ", the @xmath0 inclusive open charm decay happens through @xmath28 followed by @xmath29 , where the initial @xmath30 is configured in color - singlet .",
    "based on the result of @xmath31 , we can roughly estimate the branching fraction of @xmath32 charmed hadrons .",
    "we calculate this process in the framework of nrqcd factorization formalism , in which the un - calculable nonperturbative effects are represented by the matrix elements of nrqcd operators . according to nrqcd",
    ", the color - octet configurations appear as higher order fock states in @xmath0 decays , which are suppressed by orders of the small magnitude in relative velocity @xmath33 .",
    "hence , for a leading order calculation , we can safely treat the @xmath34 pair inside the @xmath0 to be in color - singlet .",
    "however , for the @xmath4 production in @xmath0 decays , although the higher order fock state , the @xmath35})$ ] , is suppressed by @xmath36 relative to the leading color - singlet configuration , it may be compensated by a factor of @xmath1 in regarding to color - singlet process .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the inclusive charm and charmed hadron production in @xmath0 decay is evaluated at leading order in section [ section2 ] . in section",
    "[ section3 ] , calculation of the process @xmath37 will be presented .",
    "the last section is remained for summary .",
    "in this section we calculate the charm quark production in the inclusive @xmath0 decays . at the leading order in @xmath2 , according to the nrqcd factorization formulism , its open charm decay width takes the form  = c_1^c  , where @xmath38 is a nrqcd matrix element , which represents the long - distance effect and gives the probability for finding the heavy quark and antiquark in specific configuration within the meson , and can be evaluated by nonperturbative method such as lattice simulation .",
    "the dimensionless short - distance coefficient @xmath39 can be calculated in pqcd .",
    "the dominant source of @xmath39 comes from the decay of a color - singlet @xmath40 pair into @xmath41 , followed by @xmath42",
    ".    we can calculate the process in the nonrelativistic limit , in which the @xmath40 pair can be taken as no relative momentum within @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath43 , where q is the momentum of the @xmath0 .",
    "in this situation , for the @xmath44 pair to form @xmath0 , when it is in a color - singlet state , one can replace the product of the dirac spinors for @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the initial state with the projector : u(p_b)(p_|b ) & & 12 ( q+ m__b)i_5 ( 1 r__b(0 ) ) ( * 1*_c )  , [ etab : projector ] where @xmath47 , and @xmath48 stands for the unit color matrix .",

    "the magnitude of the radial wave function at the origin @xmath63 of @xmath0 equals approximately to that of its spin triplet partner @xmath5 , which can be determined from the experimental data on the decay width of @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "that is : @xmath65 @xmath66 . with these inputs and by varying the strong coupling scale from @xmath67 to @xmath68 , for the aim of error estimation ,",

    "the region of variable @xmath76 is @xmath77 . in some cases , instead of",
    "@xmath76 it is convenient to use another variable @xmath78 , which is the momentum of the charm quark divided by its kinematically allowed maximum value in @xmath0 decays @xcite .",

    "[ diag - y1 ] ]    because almost all the charm quarks may eventually hadronize into charmed hadrons , like @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , etc .",

    "we show in figure [ diag - dd ] the @xmath86 meson differential production distribution in @xmath0 decays in the fragmentation approximation . for other charmed hadrons ,",
    "the corresponding distributions can be obtained similarly .     in the inclusive process",
    "@xmath97 with central values of inputs",
    ". [ diag - dd ] ]    it should be mentioned that since the nrqcd factorization breaks down in the @xmath98 limit , the velocity and coupling expansions are no more valid in the vicinity of the end point .",
    "a proper treatment for this endpoint illness is to resum the large logarithms of @xmath99 @xcite and invoke the shape function @xcite .",
    "for these kinds of content readers should refer to the related references in the literature ; and in this situation , the final state distribution results at the endpoint in this work should not be taken seriously . roughly speaking , when @xmath100 the endpoint effects become weak and our predictions turn to be robust @xcite .",
    "fortunately , for total decay widths , the endpoint influence is minor and the predictions are quite reliable . for the charmed hadron production , apart from the upper point problem , the lower limit also poses a problem for the fragmentation approximation , although ( [ frag ] ) only comes from the phenomenological fitting .",
    "therefore , the lower endpoint prediction should not be taken seriously as well . in ref.@xcite",
    ", there are detailed discussions about the validity of the fragmentation approximation .",
    "in this section , we present the calculation of @xmath4 inclusive production and its momentum distribution in the @xmath0 decays , as shown in figure [ diag - fm ] . as mentioned in above , at",
    "the leading order in @xmath102 only the color - singlet @xmath103 contribution in the initial state is the necessary ingredient to be considered , since the higher fock state contribution can not get big enhancement from kinematic or dynamic reasons .",
    "however , for the final state @xmath4 both the color - singlet and color - octet effects should be included , because the latter one can get one @xmath1 and kinematic compensation in comparison with the color - singlet process .",
    "since it is the @xmath30 pair annihilation in the initial state and the creation of the @xmath104 pair , as well as the emission of gluon or quarks , takes place at the hard scales set by the heavy quark masses , it is legitimate to tackle this semi - inclusive process in the pqcd framework .    .",

    ", the figure [ diag - fm](1 ) , is at order of @xmath106 , since the matrix element @xmath107 is of order @xmath108 . whereas , the color - octet process , the figure [ diag - fm](2 ) , is at order @xmath109 . here",

    "in addition of the @xmath1 compensation , the color - octet mechanism may also enhanced by the single gluon propagator .",
    "our following calculation really shows that the color - octet process should be included in this calculation .",

    "@xmath120 is the radial wave function at the origin , which is also valued through @xmath4 leptonic decay width . combining all these together",

    "since this is a two - body decay process , the @xmath4 momentum distribution @xmath156 is only a delta function peaked at @xmath157 .",
    "again , for the @xmath0 to @xmath4 inclusive decay distribution , one should pay attention to the endpoint problem @xcite .",
    "in particular for the color - octet contribution , the @xmath0 two - body decay at leading order resulting in a delta function distribution , which is smeared out by the non - perturbative effects and resulting in a shape function @xcite .",
    "the numerical result shows that the branching ratio for color - octet process is larger than the one for color - singlet process by about an order , which offers an opportunity to check the existence of color - octet mechanism experimentally .",
    "considering of the uncertainties existing in the magnitude of color - octet matrix element , the numerical difference between these two processes might shrink down , nevertheless , they give a distinctively different momentum distribution , which may also help experimenters to distinguish them in the future experiment .",
    "we have studied in the framework of nrqcd the inclusive charm production in the decay of the pseudoscalar bottomnium state @xmath0 .",
    "we find that it gives a quite large branching fraction .",
    "since the produced charm quarks will dominantly evolve into charmed hadrons , by employing the klp fragmentation function , we give out the momentum distribution of @xmath86 , as an example .",
    "we have also calculated the decay width and the momentum distribution of the inclusive @xmath4 production in the @xmath0 decay .",
    "we find that in this case the color - octet process should be taken into consideration .",
    "however , this two different @xmath4 production schemes have obviously different momentum distributions .",
    "this is a distinct character of this process , which will be helpful for future experiment to investigate the @xmath0 and to the study @xmath4 production .    in all , to investigate the elusive @xmath0 is still an interesting task for both theory and experiment .",

    "<S> based on the non - relativistic qcd factorization formalism , we calculate the bottomonium ground state , @xmath0 , inclusive charm decays at the leading order in the strong coupling constant @xmath1 and quarkonium internal relative velocity @xmath2 . the inclusive charm pair production in @xmath0 decay is mainly realized through @xmath3 process , where the charm and anti - charm quarks then dominantly hadronize into charmed hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> the momentum distributions of the final states are presented . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we also calculate the @xmath4 inclusive production rate in the @xmath0 decays , where the color - octet contribution is found to be very important . </S>",
    "<S> we expect this study may shed some light on finding @xmath0 or knowing more about its nature . + pacs number(s ) : 12.38.bx , 12.39.hg , 13.20.gd </S>"
