    "a pioneer study of @xmath23 hypernuclei by dover and gal @xcite has found that a @xmath23-nucleus potential has a well depth of @xmath27 mev in the real part on the analysis of old emulsion data .",

    "the @xmath32 ,  @xmath4 ) reaction is one of the most promising ways of studying doubly strange systems such as @xmath8 hypernuclei for the forthcoming j - parc experiments @xcite .",
    "one expects that these experiments will confirm the existence of @xmath23 hypernuclei and establish properties of the @xmath23-nucleus potential , e.g. , binding energies and widths .",
    "this reaction can also populate a @xmath25 hypernucleus through a conventional dcx two - step mechanism as @xmath33 followed by @xmath34 @xcite , as shown in fig .",

    "the cross section at @xmath242 for quasielastic @xmath25 production at @xmath5 1.8 gev / c in the two - step mechanism , which is summed over all final state , is given @xcite as @xmath263 where @xmath264 0.0220.019 mb@xmath265 is a constant nature of the angular distributions of the two elementary processes , @xmath266 1.68 gev / c is the intermediate pion momentum , and @xmath267 0.028 mb@xmath265 is the mean inverse - square radial separation of the proton pair .",
    "@xmath268 1 is the effective number of proton pairs including the nuclear distortion effects @xcite .",
    "the elementary laboratory cross section @xmath269 is estimated to be 1.571.26 mb / sr for @xmath270 and 0.0700.067 mb / sr for @xmath271 depending on the nuclear medium corrections .",
    "this yields @xmath272 which is half smaller than @xmath360.14 @xmath182b / sr at 1.1 gev / c . considering a high momentum transfer @xmath273 400 mev / c in the ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) reactions",
    ", we expect that the production probability for the @xmath25 bound states does not exceed 1% in the quasielastic @xmath25 production , so that an estimate of the @xmath47 hypernucleus in the two - step mechanism may be on the order of 0.11 nb / sr .",
    "this cross section is smaller than the cross section for the @xmath25 @xmath11 states we mentioned above in the one - step mechanism .",
    "consequently , we believe that the one - step mechanism acts in a dominant process in the ( @xmath3 ,  @xmath4 ) reaction at 1.8 gev / c ( @xmath242 ) when @xmath198 400600 mev .",
    "this implies that the ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) spectrum provides valuable information concerning @xmath24@xmath25 dynamics in the @xmath88 @xmath302 systems such as @xmath25 and @xmath23 hypernuclei , which are often discussed in a full coupling scheme @xcite .",
    "we have examined theoretically production of doubly strange hypernuclei in the dcx @xmath2o(@xmath3 ,  @xmath4 ) reaction at 1.8 gev / c within dwia calculations using coupled - channel green s functions .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath8 admixture in the @xmath25 hypernuclei plays an essential role in producing the @xmath25 states in the ( @xmath3 ,  @xmath4 ) reaction .    in conclusion ,",
    "the calculated spectrum for the @xmath0c and @xmath1c hypernuclei in the one - step mechanism @xmath41 via @xmath8 doorways predicts promising peaks of the @xmath25 bound and excited states in the @xmath2o(@xmath3 ,  @xmath4 ) reactions at 1.8 gev / c ( 0@xmath45 ) .",
    "it has been shown that the integrated cross sections for the significant @xmath11 excited states in @xmath1c are on the order of 712 nb / sr depending on the @xmath24@xmath25 coupling strength and also the attraction in the @xmath23-nucleus potential .",
    "the @xmath8 admixture probabilities are on the order of 59% .",
    "the sensitivity to the potential parameters indicates that the nuclear ( @xmath3 ,  @xmath4 ) reactions have a high ability for the theoretical analysis of precise wave functions in the @xmath25 and @xmath23 hypernuclei .",
