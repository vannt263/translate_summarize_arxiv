    "the three bands correspond to three hierachical gas phases : cold dense gas , warm gas / dust , and hot tenuous plasma .",
    "there is a trend wherein the colder gas is located east of the hotter gas . in particular , the thin ir filaments with a width of @xmath55 ( 0.2  pc at a distance of 7.1  kpc ) are just east of the x - ray filaments ( @xmath278 ) .",
    "the trend is consistent with a scenario where the shock is interacting with multi - phase ism in the east , which then generates different types of shocks .",
    "the shock is damped while it propagates into denser medium .",
    "the fast shocks heat the moderate - density cloudlet ( @xmath279 ) to a temperature of @xmath280  kev and the low - density inter - cloud medium ( @xmath281@xmath282 ) to a temperature of @xmath245  kev ( see table  [ t : nei_vnei ] ) .",
    "the nondissociative shock transmitted into the dense molecular clumps ( @xmath283 for the clumps emitting @xmath14co  @xmath22  emission ) has a low velocity ( @xmath284 , draine & mckee 1993 ) and generates the broad / asymmetric @xmath14co  lines .",
    "therefore , the multiple shocks in clumpy ism explains the bright filamentary radiation in multi - wavelengths .",
    "the interior x - ray filaments probably arise from snr interaction with relatively dense gas ( @xmath285@xmath286 for the cold component ) , as compared to the low density of the halo gas ( @xmath287@xmath282 for the cold component ; see table  [ t : nei_vnei ] ) .",
    "kes  79  was classified as a mixed - morphology or thermal composite snr ( rho & petre 1998 ) , as its brightest x - ray emission arises from the interior and the radio emission is shell - like , different from most other thermal composite - type snrs , which have a smooth , centrally filled x - ray morphology , kes  79  has a highly structured x - ray morphology , and the interior x - ray and radio emission are correlated ( see figure  [ f : rgb ] ) .",
    "as s04 note , the inner x - ray shell and outer x - ray halo have clear - cut edges and may both come from shock surfaces . in section  [ s : xfilaments ] , we have provided evidence that the x - ray and ir filaments , and the radio shells in the snr interior result from the interaction of the shock with a dense medium .",
    "hence , projection effect is the most plausible origin of the multiple - shell structure mixed - morphology nature .",
    "kes  79  may have a double - hemisphere morphology viewed essentially along the symmetric axis .",
    "snrs breaking out from an mc into a low - density region can produce such a double - hemisphere morphology as predicted by hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , tenorio - tagle et al .",
    "1985 ; cho et al .  2015 ) .",
    "there are a number of snrs showing such double - hemisphere morphology due to shock breaking out from a dense medium , such as ic  443 ( e.g. , troja et al .",
    "2006 ) , w28 ( e.g. , dubner et al .  2000 ) , 3c391 ( e.g. , reynolds & moffett 1993 , chen et al .",
    "2004 ) , vro 42.05.01 ( e.g. , pineault et al .",
    "1987 ) , g349.7@xmath288 ( e.g. , lazendic et al .",
    "2005 ) , etc .",
    "all of these snrs are associated with mcs ( see jiang et al .",
    "2010 and references therein ) . here",
    "we suggest that kes  79  is among the group of double - hemisphere snrs interacting with mcs .",
    "the bright filaments correspond to the smaller hemisphere ( radius @xmath289 ) evolving into the denser ism , while the shock breaking out in a tenuous medium forms a larger hemisphere ( radius @xmath290 ) filled with hot halo gas .",
    "the larger hemisphere or the blow - out part is the blueshifted one essentially heading toward us . this picture can be confirmed based on the distribution of the foreground absorption , @xmath240 , and the molecular line analysis .",
    "as summarized in table  [ t : nei_vnei ] , @xmath240 is lowest in the southeast ( `` f5 '' and `` me '' ) and southwest ( `` f6 '' and `` mw '' ) of the remnant . since the column density of mc at these regions can reach as high as @xmath291 ( see figure  [ f : nh2 ] ) , heavy absorption would have been present if the mcs were in the foreground .",
    "hence , we suggest a picture where most of the molecular gas ( except that in the east ) is behind the larger hemisphere ( halo gas ) and the x - ray filaments correspond to the snr  dense - gas interacting regions . this scenario is also in agreement with the @xmath14co  shell being red - shifted due to shock perturbation ( @xmath292 - 120  @xmath4 ; see the detailed description in section  [ s : mol ] ) .",
    "most small - scale regions have temperatures @xmath221 and @xmath248 similar to those of the global gas ( see table  [ t : nei_vnei ] ) , while the filling factors @xmath293 could be varying across the remnant . hence , the overall spectral results can represent the average properties of the snr s x - ray - emitting plasma .",
    "the masses for the cool and hot phases ( @xmath294 ) are @xmath295 and @xmath296 , respectively .",
    "both masses are too high to be produced by the sn ejecta , and are most likely due to the shock - heated ism .",
    "the enriched s and ar in the hot component indicates that part of the mass in the hot phase must be also contributed by the ejecta .",
    "hence , the hot phase with lower density ( @xmath297 ) and elevated metal abundances is related to the emission in the inter - cloud medium , while the cool phase with higher density ( @xmath282 ) and solar abundances is suggested to come from the shocked denser cloud .",
    "we use the parameters of the hot phase gas to investigate the snr evolution in the inter - cloud medium .",
    "the bright x - ray emission and low ionization age ( @xmath298  kyr ) for the hot component suggest that kes  79  has not yet entered radiative phase ( at least globally ) .",
    "hence , we adopt the sedov evolutionary phase ( sedov 1959 ) for kes  79  as done in previous studies of the remnant ( e.g. s04 and a14 ) . adopting @xmath299  kev",
    "as the emission measure weighted temperature for the whole remnant , the post - shock temperature can be estimated as @xmath300 ( for ion  electron equipartition ; borkowski et al .",
    "2001 ) , which is @xmath301  kev .",
    "the shock velocity can be derived as @xmath302^{1/2}=727\\pm 5 $ ]  @xmath4 , where @xmath303 the mean atomic weight for fully ionized plasma .",
    "taking the curvature radius of the western shell @xmath304  pc ( @xmath305 ) , we estimate the explosion energy as @xmath306  erg , where @xmath307 and the preshock diffuse gas density @xmath308 .",
    "the sedov age of the remnant is estimated as @xmath309  kyr .",
    "the real age might deviate from 6.7 kyr to some extent because of the non - spherical evolution of kes  79 .",
    "varying @xmath310 between @xmath311 ( @xmath312 ) and @xmath313 ( @xmath314 ) gives an age range between 4.46.7  kyr .",
    "the lower limit 4.4  kyr is close to the ionization age of the hot component ( 4.2  kyr ) .      the asymmetric metal distribution in kes  79  is supported by both the ew maps of si and s ( see figure  [ f : ewmap ] ) and the spatially resolved spectral results ( see table  [ t : nei_vnei ] ) .",
    "notably , a bright patch is revealed in the si and s ew maps .",
    "the northwestern regions `` f11 '' , `` f10 '' have a distinctly higher @xmath248 and abundances compared to other filamentary regions .",
    "the regions overlap the bright patch in the ew maps of si and s.    the metal - rich patch mainly corresponds to the spectral extraction region `` f11 '' at @xmath315 , @xmath316 ( j2000 ) , where the hot component gas has a high @xmath248 ( @xmath317  kev ) and the largest abundances of ne ( @xmath318 ) , mg ( @xmath319 ) , si ( @xmath320 ) , s ( @xmath321 ) and ar ( @xmath322 ) .",
    "the patch is a protrusion of the filaments in the northwest ( see figure  [ f : rgb]a ) and may be an ejecta fragment or a conglomeration of ejecta fragments at a high velocity .",
    "using the hot component temperature ( @xmath323  kev ) , the velocity of the fragment is estimated to be @xmath324^{1/2}=1.0^{+0.2}_{-0.1}{\\times 10^{3}}$]@xmath4 , which is 41% faster than the mean shock velocity @xmath325  @xmath4  derived in section  [ s : global ] . in the opposite direction , the plasma in region `` f5 '' has a high temperature ( @xmath326  kev ; about twice the average value ) and a lower ionization timescale ( @xmath327 ) in the hot component , while the metal abundances are not significantly elevated .",
    "the gas in region `` f5 '' thus could be fast ejecta clump well mixed with the ambient medium .",
    "the non - uniform distribution of metal species in kes  79   and the presence of high - velocity ejecta fragement(s ) reflect the intrinsic asymmetries of the sn explosion .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    kes  79  hosts a cco , psr j1852 + 0040 , which is strong evidence of core - collapse explosion . therefore",
    ", its progenitor is a massive ( @xmath328 ) star born in the mcs . during its short lifetime ( @xmath329@xmath330 years in the main - sequence stage ; schaller et al .",
    "1992 ) , the massive progenitor launches a strong stellar wind which blows a stellar wind bubble and sculpts the parent mcs .",
    "the snr expanding inside the bubble may finally interact with the molecular cavity wall if the mc has not been dissipated , and actually several such snrs have been revealed during the past several decades ( see chen et al .",
    "2014 ; zhang et al .",
    "2015 and references therein ) .",
    "chen et al .  ( 2013 ) found a linear relationship between the size of the massive star s molecular cavity and the star s initial mass ( @xmath331@xmath332 relation ) : @xmath333  pc , where @xmath334 , @xmath335 , @xmath336 , with the mean pressure @xmath337 in the mcs about @xmath338 .",
    "this relation can be used to estimate the initial masses of the progenitors for snrs interacting with molecular cavity walls or shells .",
    "kes  79  is associated with the mcs in the velocity range of 95 - 115  @xmath4 , and the molecular shell delineates the western radio outer shell and confines the middle shell . if the smaller hemisphere corresponding to the bright x - ray / ir filaments is in contact with the molecular cavity created by the progenitor s stellar wind , we can adopt @xmath339 ( 8.3  pc ; we use @xmath340 here since part of the wind energy may leak into the tenuous medium ) .",
    "the progenitor mass of kes  79  is thus estimated to be @xmath341 .",
    "another method to estimate the progenitor mass is to compare the metal compositions inferred from the x - ray spectra with those predicted in the nucleosynthesis models .",
    "this method requires that different metal species are well mixed and observed , if the abundances from the global gas properties are used for comparison .",
    "according to the _ xmm - newton _  spectral analysis of the global hot gas , kes  79  has enriched ne ( 1.8 ) , mg ( 1.6 ) , si ( 1.4 ) , s ( 1.7 ) , and ar ( @xmath342 ) .",
    "we first compare the best - fit abundances of ne , mg , s , and ar relative to si ( e.g , [ ar / si]/[ar / si]@xmath343 ) in kes  79  to those produced by the progenitors with different masses based on the spherical core - collapse nucleosynthesis models of nomoto et al .",

    "differences between the two models are discussed by kumar et al .",
    "( 2014 ; see also kumar et al .",
    "2012 ) . however , we find that none of the available nucleosynthesis models can explain all of the observed metal abundance ratios for this snr .",
    "we subsequently compare the element masses in the x - ray - emitting gas with the predicted sn yields in the two nucleosynthesis models , which can provide at least a lower limit of the snr s progenitor mass .",
    "the element ( @xmath344 ) mass @xmath345 is estimated from the abundance @xmath346 and the mass of the hot component @xmath347 ( @xmath348 ) : @xmath349 , where @xmath350 is the solar mass fraction of the metal @xmath344 adopted from anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) . as shown in figure  [ f : yield ] , a progenitor mass less than @xmath351 can be excluded ( spherical explosion models ) , since the mass of observed ne exceeds that predicted in the @xmath352 yield models .",
    "it is consistent with the value @xmath353 given by the @xmath331@xmath332 relation ( discussed above ) . the observed metal masses are no larger than the 20  @xmath354 yield models for either the spherical or bipolar explosion ( hypernova model with kinetic energy 1030 times of the typical value of @xmath355  erg ) scenarios . under the assumption that most of the ejecta are observed in the x - ray band and that the ne and mg are well mixed in the snr",

    "however , the element masses are not consistent with any group of the modeled nucleosynthesis yields .",
    "the first explanation is that the ejecta are not well mixed or asymmetrically distributed in the snr .",
    "asymmetric distribution of ejecta is present in the snr as discussed in section  [ s : fragment ] .",
    "an alternative reason might be that kes  79  is born from an asymmetric explosion with normal kinetic energy ( @xmath356  erg ) and the ejecta abundances can not be explained with current spherical explosion or hypernova bipolar explosion model .",
    "last but not least , the available nucleosynthesis models do not consistently provide similar yields , partly because of the assumptions made in the calculations .",
    "future detailed models incorporating mildly asymmetric explosions and binary evolution are desirable to provide a more secure constraint on the progenitor of kes  79  and other snrs .",
    "we have investigated the multi - wavelength emission from the thermal composite snr kes  79 . using the multi - transition co data covering the whole snr , we study the large - scale molecular environment as well as the small - scale structures which cause the asymmetries of the snr .",
    "we also revisit the 380  ks _ xmm - newton _  mos data and carry out imaging and spectroscopic analysis of the x - ray - emitting plasma .",

    "the molecular gas region ( mostly inside a @xmath357 region ) near kes  79   has a mass of @xmath358 , which is typical for a gmc .",
