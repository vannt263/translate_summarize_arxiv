    "the inverse scattering problem consists in recovery of the refractive index from given frequency dependence of the reflection coefficient @xmath0 . in mathematical physics",
    "the inverse problem for coupled wave equations reduces to coupled gelfand ",
    "levitan  marchenko ( glm ) integral equations @xcite .",
    "however , the straightforward numerical solution of the glm equations is usually considered as too complicated for practical fbg synthesis . at first sight",
    "it requires @xmath1 operations , where @xmath2 is the number of discrete points along the grating .    since , the solution of integral equations seems to be inefficient , other numerical methods of fbg synthesis are elaborated .",
    "in particular , iterative methods with @xmath3 operations are widespread , where @xmath4 is the number of iterations necessary for convergence . for instance , they are successive kernel approximations by frangos and jaggard @xcite , high - order born approximations by peral et al @xcite or advanced algorithm by poladian @xcite which uses information about the reflection characteristics from both ends of the grating . sometimes additional approximations are applied .",
    "for example , song and shin @xcite approximate the reflection spectrum by a rational function or ahmad and razzagh @xcite approximate the kernel function of integral equations by polynomials .",
    "the alternative approach is the layer peeling method known from quantum mechanics and geophysics and applied for fbg synthesis by feced et al @xcite , poladian @xcite and skaar et al @xcite .",
    "the method has a clear physical interpretation of the reflected signal as a superposition of impulse responses from different uniform layers or point reflectors placed along the grating .",
    "each thin layer has small reflectivity and can be taken into account within the first born approximation .",
    "because of high efficiency ( of the order of @xmath5 operations ) this method becomes widely used .",
    "the disadvantage of conventional layer peeling is the exponential decay of accuracy along the grating because of error accumulation during the reconstruction process @xcite .",
    "the comparable efficiency @xmath5 was demonstrated by xiao and yashiro @xcite who transformed the glm integral equations to hyperbolic set of partial differential equations and solved it numerically .",
    "this approach have several modifications , in particular , papachristos and frangos @xcite came to second - order partial differential equations and also solved them numerically .",
    "better results at high reflectance are demonstrated by combination of the iterations and the layer peeling .",
    "it is the integral layer peeling method proposed by rosenthal and horowitz @xcite .",
    "the grating is divided into thin layers , but layers are not assumed to have uniform profile .",
    "the profile of each layer is found by iterative solution of glm equations .",
    "a recent attempt of straightforward numerical solution was made in @xcite .",
    "the glm equations was solved with the help of a bordering procedure and cholesky decomposition .",
    "this approach takes of the order of @xmath6 operations .",
    "the aim of present paper is to propose more efficient numerical algorithm with @xmath7 operations .",
    "the improvement is possible due to specific symmetry of the matrix in the discrete glm equations , the toeplitz symmetry : the elements of any one diagonal are the same .",
    "the toeplitz symmetry leads to considerable decrease in the number of operations , similar to the fast algorithms by levinson @xcite , trench @xcite and zohar @xcite .",
    "the proposed method utilizes a modified bordering procedure and a second - order approximation of integrands , the hermitian symmetry is also taken into account .",

    "the refractive index modulation is quasi - sinusoidal @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the spatial frequency , @xmath13 is the apodization function @xcite and @xmath14 is the phase modulation that describes the chirp of the grating , variation of its spatial frequency .",

    "was studied by zakharov and shabat @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the problem was reduced to the gelfand  levitan  marchenko coupled integral equations @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the fourier transform of the left reflection coefficient @xmath0 . for finite grating in the interval @xmath25 kernel functions @xmath26 are not equal to zero only within triangular domain @xmath27 . due to the causality principle",

    "the solution of the algebraic set ( [ eq8 ] ) can be found by the inversion of matrix @xmath68 using , for example , the levinson bordering algorithm @xcite .",

    ". then the lower row of inverse matrix @xmath78 is interesting for us first of all .",
    "it is known that the inverse matrix to toeplitz matrix is generally not toeplitz , but it is persymmetric , i.e. , symmetric with respect to the secondary diagonal @xcite .",
    "therefore , its lower row is the reflection of its left column @xmath79 with respect to its secondary diagonal .",
    "the left column in its turn satisfies the relation @xmath80 the vector - column in the right hand side of ( [ eq11 ] ) is the first column of the identity matrix @xmath67 .",

    "lose their accuracy , since an eigenvalue of glm equations tends to zero and the problem becomes ill - conditioned .",
    "if the grating is strong , then incident light is reflected in the domain close to the input end .",
