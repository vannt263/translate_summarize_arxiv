    "recently , the discovery of a brown dwarf binary only 2 parsecs from the sun was announced , making it the third closest system after the alpha - centauri system and barnard s star @xcite . with l7.5 and t0.5 spectral types @xcite the luhman16ab system ( also known as wise  j104915.57@xmath0531906.1 )",
    "has quickly become a benchmark for the study of ultracool atmospheres .",
    "a unique feature of the luhman16ab system is the large amplitude photometric variability ( 11% in an @xmath3 filter with a period of 4.87@xmath40.01hr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the t0.5 component , with rapid evolution of the global weather patterns on timescales of about a day @xcite .",
    "the two components of luhman16ab are separated by 1.5 \" , or 3 au @xcite , so not able to influence each other via magnetic interactions . in principle , photospheric features causing photometric variability could be magnetic- or cloud - related ; while there have been sporadic measurements of magnetic activity in mid - l and later spectral type dwarfs , no clear trends have emerged which connect photometrically variable and magnetically active ultracool dwarfs .",
    "since the atmospheres of ultracool dwarfs are increasingly neutral , they are less likely to support cool magnetic spots @xcite than their earlier type stellar counterparts , and the observed variability in late l- and t - dwarfs has been attributed to the presence of patchy clouds @xcite . despite this",
    ", there is evidence that in at least some cases , photometric variability of ultracool dwarfs is linked to magnetic activity @xcite magnetic activity signatures in ultracool dwarfs are rare : to date , only 5 l dwarfs and one t dwarf have been detected in the radio band , and only 1 l dwarf and no t dwarf has been detected in the x - ray band , with a wide range of behaviors displayed among the small number of detections .",
    "studies have shown that for late - m to early - l dwarfs faster rotation results in an increased radio detection fraction @xcite while x - ray emission seems to be suppressed leading to a sort of super - saturation @xcite .",
    "dynamo models explain the generation of magnetic fields in ultracool dwarfs by extrapolating convection - driven geodynamo models with strong density stratification @xcite : part of the convected energy flux is converted to magnetic energy to balance ohmic diffusion .",
    "such scaling laws predict quite strong magnetic fields , of order 1 kg for a 1  gy old , 0.05 m@xmath5 brown dwarf with t@xmath61500 k and average density of 90,000 kg m@xmath7 .",
    "these scalings do not , however explain why only a handful of ultracool dwarfs of spectral type l and t have been detected through radio observations ( implying field strengths compatible with these extrapolations ) while other objects have considerably lower upper limits .",
    "other parameters must govern the generation of radio emission and/or field strength . due to the proximity of the luhman16ab system",
    ", its magnetic activity can be probed with unprecedented sensitivity .",
    "an absence of activity signatures would support the prevailing view that large amplitude photometric variability of early t - dwarfs is not connected to magnetism , but rather is a consequence of patchy cloud coverage .",
    "we report on two epochs of radio observations of luhman16ab with the australia telescope compact array in march and may 2013 and on a chandra x - ray pointing carried out in november 2013.1000 disparity in upper limit of the decimeter wavelength observations compared with the centimeter wavelength upper limits , we concentrate on the atca results in the following discussion . ]",

    "[ fig : rxplot ] ]    the upper limits at 5.5 and 9 ghz for luhman16ab from atca are a factor of 15 and 10 , respectively , lower than the most sensitive upper limit of any other ultracool dwarf .",
    "the x - ray upper limit is about a factor of two deeper than previous sensitive upper limits .",
    "ind  bab ( t1+t6 ) is the next closest brown dwarf with sensitive limits on x - ray and radio emission , from @xcite . at a distance of 3.6 pc , it is only a factor of 1.8 further away than luhman16ab , conveying about a factor of three difference in luminosity sensitivity , and measurements were made for both systems with the same radio and x - ray facilities : atca and the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory .",
    "the disparity in radio upper limits can largely be attributed to the increase in bandwidth available with the cabb on atca now ( 2 ghz ) compared with what was available for @xcite s observation ( 128 mhz ) .",
    "we have presented the most sensitive upper limits on x - ray and radio emission for ultracool dwarfs to date .",
    "the t dwarf component has a measured rotation period of @xmath34h @xcite .",
    "our x - ray limit for luhman16ab confirms for late l and t dwarfs the previous evidence gained from m / l dwarfs for a sharp drop of x - ray activity levels despite fast rotation .",
    "this absence of x - ray activity is most likely associated with the high electrical resistivities in such cool atmospheres which prevent the coupling of matter and magnetic field which is necessary to develop magnetic activity @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected stellar coronal heating efficiencies ( as measured by @xmath35/l@xmath36 ) down to levels approximately a factor of five lower than our upper limit .",
    "our upper limit is also consistent with the activity levels of the sun at the highest points of its activity cycle , which reaches a maximum of @xmath37 in the 0.2 - 2.4 kev band @xcite .    as figure",
    "[ fig : rxplot ] shows , there is a marked drop - off in the number of radio detections for objects later than mid - l , with a range of radio luminosities observed at a fixed spectral type .",
    "detections of radio emission in ultracool dwarfs are often used to argue for the existence of strong magnetic fields . however , the inverse is not true : the lack of radio detection does not allow for a determination of magnetic field strengths in either of these objects , contrary to the statements made in @xcite for upper limits on radio emission to a sample of ultracool dwarfs .",
    "important conclusions regarding the physical extent of any emission can be drawn from the radio flux density upper limits in examination of the conditions under which these mechanisms operate .",
    "the interpretation of the variable radio emission in ultracool dwarfs has centered around the action of an electron - cyclotron maser operating in a region of high magnetic field strength @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the observing frequency is tied to the electron - cyclotron frequency in the emitting region and is related to @xmath38 b ( mhz ) by @xmath39 for harmonic number @xmath40 equal to 1 or 2 , implying kg fields in the radio - emitting region detected at cm wavelengths , and consistent with extrapolations from convection - driven geodynamo scaling laws @xcite . the intensity of radio emission expected from a coherent process such as this is not predictable based solely on the number of emitting particles or magnetic field strength .",
    "however , the high brightness temperatures required for coherent emission ( usually taken to be t@xmath4110@xmath42k ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) coupled with the radio flux density upper limit and observing frequency sets a stringent upper limit on the size scale of any radio - emitting region . rewriting the standard equation @xcite for parameters applicable to the current case , and taking the dwarf radius to be approximately 1 jupiter radius , in line with measurements @xcite , leads to the following constraints : + @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the size of any radio - emitting region in units of @xmath45 ( @xmath45 is one jupiter radius ( = 7.1@xmath1310@xmath46 cm ) ) , @xmath47 is the distance to the dwarf in pc , @xmath48 is the observing frequency in ghz , s@xmath49 is the flux density in @xmath10jy , and @xmath50 is the brightness temperature in k. evaluated for the upper limits at the two frequencies ( and assuming t@xmath5110@xmath42k ) gives @xmath520.002 at 5.5 ghz , and @xmath520.001 at 9 ghz .",
    "these are upper limits , as stellar phenomena have demonstrated the existence of brightness temperatures as high as t@xmath5310@xmath54k @xcite .",
    "the upper limit on size holds if the conditions are right to produce coherent emission .",
    "growth rates of the cyclotron maser instability are maximized in relatively rarefied , magnetized plasmas where the dimensionless ratio of the plasma frequency to the electron - cyclotron frequency is less than a few @xcite .",
    "the atmosphere calculations of @xcite showed that in the lower atmosphere , the total density for a dusty atmosphere model in a cool dwarf with t@xmath55 near 1500 k will be about 10@xmath56 g cm@xmath7 , with an ionization fraction of about 10@xmath58 .",
    "this would suggest an electron density of approximately 10@xmath59 cm@xmath7 .",
    "the kg field strengths for these objects derived from scaling laws , combined with these parameters , indicate that the conditions for the instability may exist , but the cyclotron maser mechanism could be inoperable for reasons still to be determined .",
    "@xcite found a strong dependence of the growth rates of the cyclotron maser instability on the opening angle of the loss cone distribution of electrons that could power the instability .",
    "beaming effects may also explain the lack of detections , if there is a misalignment between the opening angle of the emission and the line of sight .",
    "another possibility that has been put forward to explain the quiescent radio emission from ultracool dwarfs is gyrosynchrotron emission , in analogy with the magnetic activity seen in higher mass dwarf stars @xcite . for this incoherent process ,",
    "the strength of the emission depends not only on the magnetic field strength in the radio - emitting source , but also on the index of the distribution of accelerated particles with energy ( @xmath60 ) , and the size of the emitting region .",
    "figure  [ fig : limits ] displays the values of @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and size of the emitting source that are compatible with the observed upper limit on flux density at the two radio frequencies , given the limit of applicability of the analytic expressions in @xcite . while the constraints on size are not as stringent as for the case of a coherent emission , they do rule out a global gyrosynchrotron - emitting magnetosphere around one of the dwarfs in the luhman16ab system , as this would lead to detectable levels of gyrosynchrotron emission .    .",
    "each curve gives the upper limit of the region of parameter space allowed for the specified value of @xmath60 , the index of the distribution of accelerated particles producing the gyrosynchrotron emission .",
    "anything below the line is compatible with the upper limits for that combination of parameters .",
    "[ fig : limits ] ]    our discussion has concentrated mainly on steady - levels of emission . the observation of radio bursts in a relatively small sample of all radio - observed ucds combined with the small rotation period of the known radio bursters has given rise to the discussion of selection effects , e.g. , the typical length of the radio observations ( few hours ) may not have covered the  generally unknown  full rotational cycle of many ucds @xcite .",
    "this bias can be ruled out here .",
    "multiple rotation periods of the t0.5 dwarf were covered with our radio data , so the observations were sensitive to bursts occurring at particular rotation phases .",
    "yet , the viewing geometry and/or topology of the magnetic field may prevent the detection of such bursts @xmath0 if present @xmath0 on luhman16ab .",
    "limits presented here are likely unachievable for other ultracool dwarfs in the near future , only to be exceeded possibly by measurements from the athena mission ( for x - rays ) and the square kilometer array or next generation very large array future radio telescopes .",
