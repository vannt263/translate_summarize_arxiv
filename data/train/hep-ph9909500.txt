    "in the low - energy sector of the theory , the effects of quantum electrodynamics can be summarized in an effective action , the heisenberg - euler action , which enlarges the classical theory of electrodynamics by non - linear self - interactions of the electromagnetic field . technically speaking",
    ", this effective action arises from integrating out the massive ( high - energy ) degrees of freedom of electrons and positrons .",
    "this program has successfully been carried out to two - loop order @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of finite - temperature effects at the one - loop level has also been considered in various papers @xcite , and the real - time @xcite as well as the imaginary - time formalism @xcite finally arrived at congruent results .",
    "this paper is devoted to an investigation of the thermal qed effective action at the two - loop level .",
    "but contrary to the zero - temperature case , where the two - loop contribution only represents a 1%-correction to the one - loop effective action , we demonstrate that the thermal two - loop contribution is of a qualitatively different kind than the thermal one - loop part and exceeds the latter by far in the low - temperature domain .",
    "the simple physical reason for this is the following : at one loop , one takes only the massive electrons and positrons as virtual loop particles into account ( cf . fig . [ figloops](a ) ) . due to the mass gap in the fermion spectrum ,",
    "a heat bath at temperatures much below the electron mass @xmath1 can hardly excite higher fermion states .",
    "hence , one expects thermal one - loop effects to be suppressed by the electron mass .",
    "in fact , in a low - temperature expansion of the thermal one - loop effective action @xcite , one finds that each term is accompanied by a factor of @xmath2 , exhibiting an exponential damping for @xmath3 .",
    "( 125,20 ) ( 5,0 )    fmfpic2loops    ( 120,20 )    ( 0,0)(a ) ( 75,0)(b )    on the other hand , the two - loop contribution to the thermal effective action involves a virtual photon within the fermion loop ( cf .",
    "fig.[figloops](b ) ) .",
    "since the photon is massless , a heat bath of arbitrarily low temperature can easily excite higher photon states , implying a comparably strong influence of thermal effects on the effective action . in sec .",
    "2 , we are able to show that the dominant contribution to the thermal two - loop effective action in the low - temperature limit is proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "this power - law behavior always wins out over the exponential damping of the one - loop case , leading to a _ two - loop dominance _ in the low - temperature domain .",
    "one might ask whether this inversion of the loop hierarchy signals the failure of perturbation theory for finite - temperature qed .",
    "but , of course , this is not the case , since the inclusion of a virtual photon does not `` amplify '' the two - loop graph and higher ones .",
    "rather , calculating the one - loop graph should only be rated as an inconsistent truncation of the theory , since the one - loop approximation does not include all species of particles as virtual ones .",
    "besides , effective field theory techniques indicate that the three - loop contribution is of the order of @xmath5 @xcite for @xmath6 , thereby obeying the usual loop hierarchy .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 , we present the calculation of the two - loop effective qed action at finite temperature employing the imaginary - time formalism and concentrating on the low - temperature limit . the outcome will be valid for slowly varying external fields of arbitrary strength .",
    "section 3 is devoted to an investigation of light propagation at finite temperature .",
    "while , on the one hand , the well - known result for the velocity shift @xmath7 is rediscovered @xcite , we are also able to determine further contributions to the velocity shift arising from a non - trivial interplay between temperature and an additional magnetic background field .    in sec .",
    "4 , we study aspects of thermally induced photon splitting .",
    "therein , we point out that the thermal two - loop contribution to the splitting process exceeds the zero - temperature and one - loop contributions in the low - temperature and weak - field limit , but is negligible in comparison to other thermally induced scattering processes .    sections 3 and 4 are mainly concerned with the limit of a weak magnetic background field and low - frequency photons ( @xmath8 ) , and therefore represent only a first glance at these extensive subjects .",
    "in fact , the quantitative results for this energy regime describe only tiny effects ; a relevance for astrophysical topics such as pulsar physics has not been identified up to now . however , the intention of the present work is a more categoric one , namely , to elucidate the mechanism for a violation of the usual loop hierarchy of perturbative thermal field theories involving virtual massless particles .    in sec . 5",
    ", we calculate the thermal contribution to schwinger s famous pair - production formula @xcite for constant electric background fields in the low - temperature limit . here , a thermal one - loop contribution surprisingly does not exist @xcite , since the thermal one - loop effective action is purely real by construction .",
    "hence , the findings of sec . 5 prove the existence of thermally induced pair production  an effect which has been searched for for 15 years @xcite . in the low - temperature limit , we find that the situation of a strong electric field is dominated by the zero - temperature part ( schwinger formula ) , while the thermal contribution can become dominant for a weak electric field .",
    "unfortunately , the experimentally more interesting high - temperature limit can not be covered by our approach .",
    "one last word of caution : the inclusion of electric background fields in finite - temperature qed is always plagued with the question of how violently this collides with assumptions on thermal equilibrium . in fact , electric fields and thermal equilibrium exclude each other , thus questioning the physical meaning of the results of sec .",
    "5 at least quantitatively .",
    "however , it is reasonable to assume the existence of an at least small window of parameters in the low - temperature and weak - field domain for which the thermal - equilibrium calculation represents a good approximation .",
    "moreover , the knowledge of the effective lagrangian including a full dependence on all possible field configurations is mandatory to derive equations of motion for the fields , even in the limit of vanishing electric fields .",
    "in the following , we will outline the calculation of the two - loop effective action , concentrating on the low - temperature limit where a _ two - loop dominance _ is expected .",
    "the calculation is necessarily very technical , wherefore some details are left for the appendices.)-([0e ] ) , then directly consult eqs .",

    "but before we get down to business , it is useful to clarify our notation . from the field strength tensor @xmath9 and its dual @xmath10",
    ", we can construct the following standard gauge and lorentz invariants : @xmath11 where , for reasons of convenience , we also introduced the _",

    ", @xmath21 is related to the 4-velocity vector @xmath23 of the heat bath by : @xmath24 .",
    "e.g. , in the heat - bath rest frame , @xmath23 takes the form : @xmath25 .",
    "hence , we can introduce one further invariant ( beside the temperature itself ) : @xmath26 e.g. , in the heat - bath rest frame , @xmath27 simply reduces to @xmath28 .",
    "since the effective lagrangian is a lorentz covariant and gauge - invariant quantity , it can only be a function of the complete set of invariants of the system under consideration .",
    "hence , we expect a finite - temperature effective qed lagrangian of the form : @xmath29 equipped with these conventions , we now turn to the calculation .",
    "the two - loop contribution to the effective action / lagrangian @xmath30 is generally given by the diagram in fig .",
    "[ figloops](b ) .",
    "this translates into the following formula in coordinate space @xcite : @xmath31\\ , d_{\\mu\\nu}(x - x'),\\label{01}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 represents the fermionic green s function for the dirac operator in presence of an external electromagnetic field @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 denotes the photon propagator . throughout the paper",
    ", we assume the background field to be constant or at least slowly varying compared to the scale of the compton wavelength ; therefore , the fermionic green s function can be written as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the fourier transform of @xmath32 depending only on the field strength , and @xmath37 is the holonomy carrying the complete gauge dependence of the green s function .",

    "\\label{3}\\ ] ] so we have finally arrived at the well - known fact that the two - loop effective action can be obtained from the polarization tensor in an external field by glueing the external lines together .",
    "the transition to finite - temperature field theory can now be made within the imaginary - time formalism by replacing the momentum integration over the zeroth component in eqs .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) by a summation over bosonic and fermionic matsubara frequencies , respectively .",
    "e.g. , performing this procedure in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) corresponds to thermalizing the fermions in the loop .",

    ", thermalizing the polarization tensor contributes at most terms of order @xmath47 to the two - loop lagrangian for @xmath46 ; these are furthermore accompanied by an additional factor of the coupling constant @xmath48 and can therefore be neglected compared to the one - loop terms . at low temperature ,",
    "it is therefore sufficient to thermalize the internal photon only in order to obtain the leading @xmath0-dependence of @xmath49 .",

    "we could even use the one - component formalism only , since we merely consider the photon to be thermalized .",

    "since the transformation into the new reference frame is only a rigid rotation in minkowski space , no jacobian arises for the measure of the momentum integral .",

    "c , we check explicitly that the first term of eq .",
    "( [ 29 ] ) indeed leads to the ( unrenormalized ) two - loop lagrangian for arbitrary constant electromagnetic fields at zero temperature .",
    "e.g. , for purely magnetic fields , the representation of dittrich and reuter @xcite is rediscovered .    for our finite - temperature considerations",

    "( [ 29 ] ) , which we denote by @xmath93 in the following . concerning the formula for @xmath55 in eq .",

    "( [ 17 ] ) ; for this , we have to interpret @xmath93 as a function of @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( remember : @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are functions of @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) : @xmath98 where we defined the auxiliary integral : @xmath99 upon a substitution of the integration variable , leads to a quadratic equation from which the positive root has to be taken in order to take care of the integral boundaries . ]",
    "@xmath100 the auxiliary integral becomes : @xmath101 now we come to an important point : since we only thermalized the photons , our effective lagrangian @xmath55 is only valid for @xmath46 anyway .",
    "nevertheless , our formulas also contain information about the high - temperature domain which we should discard , since it is incomplete .",
    "regarding eq .",
    "( [ 36 ] ) , the exponential function causes the integrand to be extremely small for small values of @xmath0 , except where @xmath102 is also small .",
    "hence , the auxiliary integral is mainly determined by the lower end of the integration interval .",
    "taking these considerations into account , we expand the square root for small values of @xmath102 and then extend the integration interval to infinity ( in fact , maintaining 1 as the upper bound only creates terms of the order @xmath103 , which are subdominant in the low - temperature limit ) .",

    "( [ 32 ] ) ) : @xmath107 in this equation , we indeed discover a power - law dependence on the temperature , which will directly translate into a power - law dependence of the two - loop effective action after insertion into eqs .",
    "( [ 31 ] ) and ( [ 11a ] ) . technically speaking ,",
    "this arises from the fact that the omnipresent exponential factor @xmath108 , which finally causes exponential damping for @xmath109 , becomes equal to 1 after the @xmath102-integration at the lower bound at @xmath110 .    at this stage , it is important to observe that the @xmath102-integration appears only in @xmath94 ( via the @xmath111-integration in eq .",

    "therefore , @xmath93 will always contain exponential damping factors in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "even the remaining proper - time integrations do not provide for a mechanism similar to the @xmath102-integration , since for large @xmath63 , the mass factor @xmath112 with the causal prescription @xmath68 causes the integrand to vanish , and for small @xmath63 , the combination @xmath113 in the exponent becomes : @xmath114 obviously , inserting eq .",

    "the thermal contribution even becomes the dominant one .    in the opposite limit , where @xmath272 , i.e. , for strong electric fields beyond the critical field strength , the 1/3 in parentheses dominates the expression in eq .",

    "similarly to the case of strong magnetic fields , we find that the non - linearities of pure ( zero-@xmath0 ) vacuum polarization exceed the polarizability of the thermally induced real plasma by far in the strong field limit .    nevertheless , in the limit of weak electric fields , thermal effects can increase the pair - production probability @xmath277 significantly , as was shown in eq .",
    "( [ 87 ] ) .",
    "of course , for these values of @xmath263 , the total imaginary part is very small due to the inverse power of @xmath263 in the exponential .",

    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the pair - production probability also increases at most logarithmically with @xmath0 . in view of these considerations , a power - law growth as suggested in @xcite does not appear plausible .",
