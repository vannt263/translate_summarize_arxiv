    "historically , the presence of a scalar field in the context of general relativity dates back to kaluza - klein theory @xcite .",
    "kaluza - klein theory was presented in order to give a unified theory describing gravity and electromagnetic .",
    "it may be considered as a pioneering theory to the string theory .",
    "afterwards , in brans - dicke ( bd ) theory , the notion was seriously taken into account @xcite .",
    "the root of this theory can be traced back to mach s principle encoded by a varying gravitational constant in bd theory .",
    "the variety of gravitational constant is indicated in this theory by considering a scalar field non - minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "bd theory is known as a non - quantum scalar - tensor theory @xcite . from quantum viewpoint , the scalar field called dilaton field",
    "is emerged in the low energy limit of string theory @xcite .    on the other side ,",
    "there are strong evidences on the observational sides that our universe is currently experiencing a phase of accelerating expansion @xcite .",
    "this acceleration phase can not be explained through standard model of cosmology which is based on the einstein theory of general relativity .",
    "one way for explanation of such an acceleration is to add a new unknown component of energy , usually called dark energy .",
    "another way for challenging with this problem is to modify the einstein theory of gravity . in this",
    "regards , some physicists have convinced that einstein theory of gravitation can not give a complete description of what really occurs in our universe and one needs an alternative theory . as we mentioned above , string theory , in its low energy limit , suggests a scalar field which is nonminimally coupled to gravity and other fields called dilaton field @xcite .",
    "consequently , dilaton gravity as one of the alternatives of einstein theory have encountered high interest in recent years .",
    "string theory also suggests dimensions of spacetime to be higher than four dimensions .",
    "it seemed for a while that dimensions higher than four should be of planck scale , but recent theories expresses that our three - dimensional brane can be embedded in a relatively large higher dimensional bulk which is still unobservable @xcite .",
    "in such a scenario , all gravitational objects including black objects are higher dimensional .",
    "the action of dilaton gravity usually includes one or more liouville - type potentials which can be justified as trace of supersymmetry breaking of spacetime in ten dimensions .",
    "many authors have explored exact charged black solutions in the context of einstein - dilaton gravity .",
    "for instance , asymptotically flat black hole solutions in the absence of the dilaton potential are studied in refs .",
    "cdb1,cdb2,mw , pw . in recent years , ads / cft correspondence have made asymptotically non - flat solutions more valuable .",
    "on the other hand , study of asymptotically non - flat and non - ads solutions extends the validity range of tools already applied and tested in the cases of asymptotically flat or ads spacetimes .",
    "many efforts have been made to find and study static and rotating nonflat exact solutions in the literature .",
    "static asymptotically nonflat and non ads solutions and their thermodynamics were explored in mw , pw , chm , cai , clem , yaz , srm , shey2 .",
    "different aspects of exact rotating nonflat solutions have also been studied in fr , dias , har , mai , deh1,mitra , shey0,sdr , sheyhendi , shey3 .    in the present paper",
    "we extend the study on the dilaton gravity to include the power - law maxwell field term in the action .",
    "the motivation for this study comes from the fact that , as in the case of scalar field which has been shown that particular power of the massless klein - gordon lagrangian shows conformal invariance in arbitrary dimensions @xcite , one can have a conformally electrodynamic lagrangian in higher dimensions .",
    "it is worth mentioning that maxwell lagrangian , @xmath2 is conformally invariant only in four dimensions , while it was shown that the lagrangian @xmath3 is conformally invariant in @xmath4-dimensions @xcite . in other words ,",
    "this lagrangian is invariant under the conformal transformation @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the studies on the black object solutions coupled to a conformally invariant maxwell field have got a lot of attentions in the past decades hass1,hendisedehi , confshey2,sad , kzsd .",
    "thermodynamics of higher dimensional ricci flat rotating black branes with a conformally invariant power - maxwell source in the absence of a dilaton field were studied in @xcite .",
    "recently , we explored exact topological black hole solutions in the presence of nonlinear power - law maxwell source as well as dilaton field @xcite . since these solutions ( @xcite ) are static , it is worthwhile to construct the rotating version of the solutions",
    ". charged rotating dilaton black branes in dilaton gravity and their thermodynamics in the presence of linear maxwell field and nonlinear born - infeld electrodynamics have been studied in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "till now , charged rotating dilaton black objects coupled to a power - law maxwell field has not been constructed . in this paper",
    ", we intend to construct a new class of @xmath7-dimensional rotating dilaton black branes in the presence of power - law maxwell field , where we relax the conformally invariant issue for generality . of course",
    ", the solution do exist for the case of conformally invariant source .",
    "we find that the solutions exist provided one takes liouville - type potentials with two terms . in the limiting case of maxwell field ,",
    "one of the liouville potentials vanishes .",
    "we shall investigate thermodynamics as well as thermal stability of our rotating black brane solutions and explore the effects of the dilaton and power - law maxwell fields on thermodynamics and thermal stability of these black branes .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    ", we present the basic field equations of einstein - dilaton gravity with power - law maxwell field and find a new class of charged rotating black brane solutions of this theory and investigate their properties . in section [ therm ] , we obtain the conserved and thermodynamic quantities of the solutions and verify the validity of the first law of black hole thermodynamics . in sec .",
    "[ stab ] , we study thermal stability of the solutions in both canonical and grand - canonical ensembles . we finish our paper with closing remarks in the last section .",

    "the above solutions will fully satisfy the system of equations provided , @xmath66it is worthwhile to note that the necessity of existence of the term @xmath67 in scalar field potential is due to nonlinearity of maxwell field and this term vanishes for the case of linear maxwell field where @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "note that in our solutions @xmath36  remains as a free parameter which plays the role of the cosmological constant .",

    "this discussion is given here because it is necessary to know these restrictions for next studies . in section ( [ therm ] )",

    "thus , the value of electromagnetic vector potential should be finite at infinity so that we have finite mass . in order to guarantee this behavior",
    "@xmath73 should be positive i.e.@xmath74the above equation leads to the following restriction on the range of @xmath16 , @xmath75on the other hand , the effect of @xmath62  in metric function should vanish in spacial infinity .",
    "this fact leads to a restriction on @xmath17   @xmath76therefore , one can sum up the constraints ( [ res3 ] ) and ( [ res5 ] ) as follows :    @xmath77    it is worth mentioning that the solution is always well - defined in the above allowed ranges of @xmath17  and @xmath16 . in continue of this section",

    "this behavior is also seen in the special cases of @xmath18  or @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , the first term in @xmath51 ( ( fr ) ) determines the behavior of it at infinity . since we are interested in the solutions that go to infinity as @xmath80 , we assume @xmath81 and take it in the standard form @xmath82 .",
    "it is also notable to mention that the spacetime is neither asymptotically flat nor ads due to existence of dilaton field . about @xmath78 ,",
    "the term including @xmath83 in metric function is dominant .",
    "this term is always positive in permitted ranges of @xmath16 and @xmath17 because @xmath84 in these ranges .",
    "therefore as in the case of reissner - nordstrom black holes , we have timelike singularity and there are no schwarzschild - type black hole solutions .",
    "we continue our discussions about properties of the solutions by looking for curvature singularities .",
    "since essential singularities are located at divergencies of kretschmann scalar , we seek for these for our solutions .",
    "it is easy to show that the kretschmann scalar @xmath85 diverges at @xmath78 while it is finite for @xmath86  and goes to zero as @xmath80 and therefore there is an essential singularity located at @xmath78 .",
    "although the location of event horizon can not be determined analytically by using @xmath51 , fortunately we can get more insight about the solutions by calculating temperature corresponding to event horizon .",
    "the temperature and angular velocity of the horizon can be obtained by analytic continuation of the metric .",
    "the analytical continuation of the lorentzian metric by @xmath87and @xmath88  yields the euclidean section . in order that euclidean metric is regular at @xmath89 , one should identify @xmath90  and @xmath91 , where @xmath92  and @xmath93s are the inverse hawking temperature and the @xmath94th component of angular velocity of the horizon .",
    "then , temperature and @xmath94th component of angular velocity can be computed as    @xmath95    numerical calculations show that temperature vanishes at event horizon for extreme black brane solutions .",

    "note that there is a relation between @xmath101 and @xmath100 as    @xmath104    which reduces to extremal mass obtained in @xcite for linear maxwell field ( @xmath18 ) and to one obtained in @xcite in the absence of dilaton field @xmath105 and with linear maxwell field . finally , it is noticeable to mention that there is a killing horizon in addition to event horizon for rotating solutions in our einstein - dilaton gravity as in the case of rotating black solutions of the einstein gravity .",
    "it is easy to show that the killing vector field@xmath106is the null generator of the event horizon , where @xmath32  denote the number of rotation parameters @xcite and @xmath107  is a constant that we will fix it in next section .",
    "the killing horizon is a null surface whose null generators are tangent to a killing field .",
    "in this section , we discuss thermodynamics of rotating black brane solutions in the presence of power - law maxwell field . since the discussion of thermodynamics of these solutions depends on the calculation of the mass and other conserved charges of the spacetime , we first compute these conserved quantities .",

    "stability is shown in fig .",

    "in contrast with @xmath70 and @xmath17 , there is a lower limit for @xmath16 i.e. for @xmath189 , we have stable solutions .",
    "@xmath190 is again ensemble dependent as well as @xmath186 and @xmath191 . for @xmath192  where @xmath17  has a @xmath193-dependent lower limit ,",

    "in this paper , we constructed a new class of higher dimensional nonlinear charged rotating black brane solutions in einstein - dilaton gravity with complete set of rotation parameters .",
    "the nonlinear electromagnetic source was considered in the form of the power - law maxwell field which guarantees conformal invariance of the electromagnetic lagrangian in arbitrary dimensions for specific choices of power . due to the presence of the dilaton field ,",
    "our solutions are neither asymptotically flat nor ( a)ds . we showed that in case of power - law maxwell field , one needs two liouville type potentials in order to have a rotating black brane solutions while in the case of linear maxwell source just one term is needed @xcite .",
    "the extra dilaton potential term disappears for @xmath18 .",
    "all our results reproduce the results of @xcite in the case of linear charged rotating solutions where @xmath18 .    demanding from one side that the value of total mass should be finite and from the other side that the effect of mass term in metric function should disappear at infinity",
    ", we found some restrictions on @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the allowed ranges of these two parameters is as follows . for @xmath194",
    ", we have @xmath196 while for @xmath192 , we have @xmath197 . for these permitted ranges ,",
    "our solutions are always well - defined .",
    "also , in these ranges of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the charge term in metric function @xmath51 is always positive and dominant in the vicinity of @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , schwarzschild - like solutions are ruled out .",
    "however , solutions with two inner and outer horizons , extreme solutions and naked singularities are allowed .    in order to study thermodynamics of charged rotating black branes , we calculated mass , charge , temperature , entropy , electric potential energy and angular momentum . using these quantities we obtained smarr - type formula for the mass @xmath159 and showed that the first law of thermodynamics is satisfied .",
    "next , we analysed thermal stability of the solutions in both canonical and grand - canonical ensembles .",
    "these investigations showed that for @xmath0 charged rotating black brane solutions are always stable with any value of the charge parameter . for @xmath185 , there is a @xmath186 in each of ensembles that we have stable solutions provided their radius are smaller than @xmath198 . in terms of @xmath199 ,",
    "the solutions is changed from stable ones to unstable ones when they meet an @xmath187 .",
    "versus @xmath16 and @xmath42 , we showed that the solutions encounter @xmath190 and @xmath195 respectively so that solutions with @xmath42 and @xmath16 parameters lower than them are unstable for @xmath185 .",
    "all @xmath198 , @xmath187 , @xmath195 and @xmath190 values depend on the ensemble .",
    "it is worth noting that the higher dimensional charged rotating solutions obtained here have flat horizon .",
    "one may interested in studying the rotating solutions with curved horizon .",
    "specially the case of spherical horizon will be a good extension of kerr - newmann solution .",
    "it seems that the study of the general case is a difficult problem .",
    "however , it is possible to seek for slowly rotating nonlinear charged solutions with curved horizon .",
