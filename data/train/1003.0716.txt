    "one of the characteristic traits of quantum mechanics is that not all possible states of a physical system are perfectly distinguishable .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the classical world , but enables us to solve cryptographic problems such as key distribution  @xcite or two - party computation in the noisy - storage model  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is often possible to gain partial knowledge about the state .",
    "imagine a physical system is prepared in one out of several possible states chosen with a certain probability .",
    "the set of possible states , as well as the distribution are thereby known to us .",
    "the goal of _ state discrimination _ is to identify which state was chosen by performing a measurement on the system , whereby our aim is to choose measurements that maximize the average probability of success .",
    "this fundamental problem has been studied extensively for the past 30 years , starting with the works of helstrom  @xcite , holevo  @xcite and belavkin  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a survey of known result ) , and has found many applications in quantum information theory ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) , cryptography  @xcite , and algorithms  @xcite .        here",
    ", we consider a special twist to the standard state discrimination problem introduced in  @xcite , in which we obtain additional information after the measurement that may help us to identify the state .",
    "this task is easily described in terms of the following game depicted in figure  [ fig : game ] : imagine alice chooses a state @xmath0 from a finite set @xmath1 with probability @xmath2 , labeled by what we will call the _ string _ @xmath3 and the _ encoding _ @xmath4 .",
    "bob knows @xmath1 as well as the distribution @xmath5 .",
    "alice then sends the state to bob .",
    "bob may now perform any measurement from which he obtains a classical measurement outcome @xmath6 . afterwards , alice informs him about the encoding @xmath7 .",
    "the task of _ state discrimination with post - measurement information _ ( and no memory ) for bob is to identify the string @xmath8 , using the encoding @xmath7 and his classical measurement outcome @xmath6 , where we are again interested in maximizing bob s average probability of success over all measurements he may perform  . in  @xcite it was shown how bounds on this success probability can be used to prove security in the noisy - storage model .        naturally , from a cryptographic standpoint it would be useful to know how much the additional information @xmath7 can actually help bob .",
    "let @xmath9 and @xmath10 be the maximum average probabilities of success for the problem of state discrimination with and without post - measurement information respectively .",
    "note that @xmath11 , since we can always choose to ignore any additional information .",
    "we will measure how useful post - measurement information is for bob in terms of the difference in his success probability @xmath12 of course , even in a classical setting post - measurement information can help bob determine the string @xmath8 . as a very simple example , suppose that @xmath13 is a single classical bit , and we have only one encoding @xmath14 .",
    "imagine that alice chooses @xmath8 and one of the two encodings uniformly at random and sends bob the bit @xmath15 .",
    "the states corresponding to this encoding are thus given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "note that bob now has a randomly chosen bit in his possession and hence @xmath18 .",
    "however , he can decode correctly once he receives the additional information @xmath7 and thus @xmath19 , giving us @xmath20 .",
    "as has been shown in  @xcite we always have @xmath19 in the classical world where all states @xmath0 are diagonal in the same basis and orthogonal for fixed @xmath7 .",
    "we first provide a general condition for checking the optimality of measurements for our task ( see section  [ sec : optimality ] ) .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the optimal measurments can be found numerically using semidefinite programming solvers , however in higher dimensions this remains prohibitively expensive .",
    "we then focus on the case which is particularly interesting for cryptography , namely when the string @xmath8 is chosen uniformly and independently from the encoding @xmath7 .",
    "first , we provide upper and lower bounds for the success probability @xmath21 ( section  [ sec : lowerbound ] and  [ sec : upperbound ] ) .    in section  [ sec : tightbounds ]",
    ", we then show that for a large class of encodings ( so - called _ clifford encodings _ ) our lower bound is in fact tight .",
    "we thereby explicitely provide the optimal measurements for clifford encodings .",
    "the class of encodings we consider includes any encodings into two orthogonal pure states in dimension @xmath22 such as the well - known bb84 encodings  @xcite , as well as the case where we have two possible strings and encodings which can be reduced to a problem in dimension @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "it was previously observed that for bb84 encodings post - measurement information was useless  @xcite .",
    "here , we see that this is no mere accident , and give a general condition for when post - measurement information is useless for clifford encodings .",
    "we continue by showing that for clifford encodings , we can always perform a relabeling of the strings @xmath8 depending on the encoding @xmath7 such that we obtain a new problem for which post - measurement information is indeed useless .",
    "this is particularly appealing from a cryptographic perspective as it means the adversary can not gain any additional knowledge from the post - measurement information .",
    "this means that for clifford encodings we no longer need to treat the problem _ with _ post - measurement information any differently , and can instead apply the well - studied machinery of state discrimination .",
    "however , we will see that a relabeling that renders post - measurement information useless is impossible when considering a _ classical _ ensemble   all commute . ] .",
    "in particular , we will see that as long as we are able to gain some information about the encoded string @xmath8 without waiting for the post - measurement information , then classically we can not hope to find a non - trivial relabeling that makes post - measurement information useless .",
    "we thereby focus on the case of encodings a single bit into two possible encodings in detail .",
    "curiously , we will show this by relating the problem to bell inequalities  @xcite , such as for example the well - known chsh inequality  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the usefulness of post - measurement information forms another intriguing property that distinguishes the quantum from the classical world .",
    "before investigating the use of post - measurement information , we derive general conditions for the optimality of measurements for our task .",
    "we also provide a general bound on the success probability when the distribution over @xmath23 is uniform ( i.e. , @xmath24 ) and independent of the choice of encoding .      when considering state discrimination with post - measurement information , we can without loss of generality assume that bob performs a measurement whose outcomes correspond to vectors @xmath25 where each entry corresponds to the answer that bob will give when he later learns which one of the @xmath26 possible encodings was used .",
    "that is , when the encoding was @xmath7 , bob will output the guess @xmath27 of the vector @xmath28  @xcite . in",
    "@xcite it was noted that the average probability that bob outputs the correct guess @xmath27 when given the post - measurement information @xmath7 maximized over all possible measurements ( povms ) can be computed by solving the following semidefinite program ( sdp ) .",
    "the primal of this sdp is given by    maximize@xmath29 & @xmath30 + & @xmath31  ,    where @xmath32 by forming the lagrangian , we can easily compute the dual of this sdp ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix a ) ) which is given by    minimize@xmath33 & @xmath34  .",
    "sdps can be solved in polynomial time ( in the input size ) using standard algorithms  @xcite , which also provide us with the optimal measurement operators .",
    "however , with the sdp formalism in mind , it is now also easy to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for when a set of measurement operators @xmath35 is in fact optimal .",
    "similar conditions were derived for the case of state discrimination _ without _ post - measurement information  @xcite .",

    "a proof can be found in the appendix .",
    "let @xmath41 be the number of possible strings , and suppose that the joint distribution over strings and encodings satisfies @xmath42 , where the distribution @xmath43 is arbitrary .",

    "note that the bound on the r.h.s contains very many terms , and yet our normalization factor is only @xmath49 .",
    "nevertheless , for many interesting examples we can obtain a useful bound this way , by choosing @xmath50 to be sufficiently large .",
    "similarly , if @xmath8 is chosen uniformly at random and independent of the encoding , we can find a lower bound to @xmath21 .",
    "the idea behind this lower bound is to subdivide the problem into a set of smaller problems which we can solve using standard techniques from state discrimination .",

    "the vector @xmath28 can thus be written analogously as a vector @xmath52 .",

    "i.e. , @xmath66    in particular , this allows us to apply any known lower bounds for the standard task of state discrimination  @xcite to this problem .",
    "curiously , we will see that there exists a large class of problems for which this bound is tight , even though @xmath67 , that is , even though post - measurement information is useful .",
    "we now consider a very special class of problems called _ clifford encodings _ , for which we can determine the optimal measurement explicitly . in this problem",
    ", we will only ever encode a single bit @xmath13 chosen uniformly at random independent of the choice of encoding , and take @xmath68 dimensional states of the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 are generators of the clifford algebra , that is , anti - commuting operators   for @xmath71 . ] satisfying @xmath72 for all @xmath73 .",
    "we also assume that the vector @xmath74 satisfies @xmath75 and @xmath76 . the distribution over encodings can be arbitrary .",
    "using the fact that the operators anti - commute , it is not hard to see that @xmath77 for @xmath71 and the latter condition then ensures that @xmath0 is a valid quantum state  @xcite , that is , @xmath0 is positive semi - definite satisfying @xmath78 .",
    "the clifford algebra has a unique representation by hermitian matrices on @xmath79 qubits ( up to unitary equivalence ) which we fix henceforth .",
    "this representation can be obtained via the famous jordan - wigner transformation  @xcite : @xmath80 for @xmath81 , where we use @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 to denote the pauli matrices .",
    "we also use @xmath85 .",

    "a simple example , is the bb84 encoding  @xcite where we encode the bit @xmath8 into the computational basis labeled by @xmath89 and into the hadamard basis labeled by @xmath90 .",
    "furthermore , if we have only two possible strings and encodings , we can always reduce the problem to dimension @xmath22  @xcite . in higher dimensions ,",
    "encodings of the above form were suggested for the use in cryptographic protocols  @xcite .",
    "we now first examine the setting of state discrimination _ without _ post - measurement information , which will provide us with the necessary intuition .",
    "again , we use @xmath26 to denote the number of possible encodings .",
    "recall the average state @xmath91 from   for the vector @xmath92 , which tells us for every possible encoding which bit appears in the sum . we furthermore define the complementary vector @xmath93 , that is , @xmath94 . as a warmup ,",
    "suppose we are given @xmath91 and @xmath95 chosen uniformly at random and wish to determine which one . clearly , this is an example of state discrimination _ without _ post - measurement information , which can also be written as an sdp  @xcite .",

    "analogous to lemma  [ lem : conditions ] with @xmath103 one can derive optimality conditions which for the case of state discrimination were previously obtained in  @xcite . in our case",
    "they tell us that @xmath104 must be hermitian , and @xmath105 is a feasible dual solution .",
    "all we have to do is thus to guess an optimal measurement , and use these conditions to prove its optimality .",

    "the measurements given in   are optimal to discriminate @xmath91 from @xmath95 chosen with equal probability .      we are now ready to determine the optimal measurements for the case _ with _ post - measurement information .",
    "first of all , recall from lemma  [ lem : lowerbound ] that we can subdivide our problem into smaller parts by partitioning the set of strings @xmath28 . applied to the present case ,",
    "these partitions are simply given by @xmath113 where for simplicity we here use the vector @xmath28 itself to label the partition .",

    "this shows that for our class of problems the problem of finding the optimal measurement can be simplified considerably and is easily evaluated .",
    "it is a very useful consequence of our analysis that for any cryptographic application that makes use of such encodings , we can always perform a relabeling of states @xmath0 such that post - measurement information becomes useless .",
    "more precisely , we will associate @xmath28 with the new all @xmath118 vector and @xmath119 with the new @xmath120 vector .",

    "we now consider a small example that illustrates how our statement applies to the case where we have only two possible encodings @xmath124 into two orthogonal pure states in dimension @xmath22 , and we choose the encoding uniformly at random ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "a simple example is encoding into the bb84 bases  @xcite , where we pick the computational basis for @xmath126 and the hadamard basis for @xmath90 .",
    "we now show that in two dimensions , post - measurement information is useless if and only if the angle between the bloch vectors for the states @xmath127 and @xmath128 obeys @xmath129 as illustrated in figures  [ fig : piuseless ] and  [ fig : piuseful ] .    .",

    "first of all , can we obtain sharper bounds ?",
    "since solving an sdp numerically is still very expensive in higher dimensions , it would also be interesting to prove bounds on how well generic measurements such as the square - root measurement ( also known as the pretty good measurement  @xcite ) perform .",
    "the pretty good measurement is a special case of belavkin s weighted measurements  @xcite , which was already used in its cube weighted form in  @xcite to provide bounds on the state discrimination with post - measurement information . such bounds have most recently been shown by tyson  @xcite for standard state discrimination . yet , no good bounds are known on how well such measurements perform for our task .",
    "more generally , it would be very interesting to see whether one can adapt the iterative procedures investigated in  @xcite to find optimal measurements for the case of standard state discrimination without post - measurement information to this setting .",
    "concerning such iterative procedures , we would like to draw special attention to the recent work by tyson  @xcite generalizing monotonicity results for such iterates  @xcite , which could be applied here .",
    "naturally , it would be very interesting to know if our results for clifford encodings can be extended to a more general setting .",
    "our discussion of classical ensembles shows that there exist problems for which @xmath198 no matter what relabeling we perform  @xcite , and hence we can not hope that a similar statement holds in general .",
    "nevertheless , it would be interesting to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for when post - measurement is already useless , or otherwise can be made useless by performing a relabeling .",

    "note that this means that @xmath105 already satisfies condition ( 2 ) , and all that remains is to show that @xmath105 has the desired form given by condition ( 1 ) . since @xmath201 is a feasible solution for the primal sdp , we have by slater s condition  @xcite that the optimal values @xmath202 and @xmath203 are equal , i.e. , @xmath204 . using the fact that @xmath31 and that the trace is cyclic we thus have @xmath205 since @xmath38 ( equivalently @xmath206 . ) , and @xmath97 for all @xmath28 we have that all the terms @xmath207 in the sum are positive and hence we must have for all @xmath28 that @xmath208 . again using the fact that the two operators are positive semidefinite , and the cyclicity of the trace we thus have for the optimal solution that @xmath209 summing the l.h.s . over all @xmath28 and noting that @xmath31 then gives us condition ( 1 ) .",
