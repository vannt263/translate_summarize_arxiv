    "the coefficients @xmath7 and @xmath8 are two coprime integers where @xmath9 .",
    "the fibers along which the surgeries are performed are called exceptional fibers , all other fibers are called ordinary . if the base space @xmath3 is compact then @xmath0 is compact and the number of exceptional fibers is finite  @xcite .",
    "links in seifert fibered spaces are embeddings of several disjoint copies of circles @xmath10 . as for links in the @xmath11-sphere",
    ", we may want to find suitable ways to represent them and we may want to find invariants to distinguish them .",
    "one of the main reason to be interested in links in seifert fibered spaces is the computation of skein modules of these particular @xmath11-manifolds .",
    "skein modules are not only important invariants of @xmath11-manifolds , but are also useful for topological quantum field theories .",
    "links in @xmath1-bundles are best described by arrow diagrams introduced by mroczkowski in @xcite . since seifert fibered",
    "spaces resemble @xmath1-bundles , we use these types of diagrams as in @xcite . in section  [ linkmoves ]",
    "we present a generalized planar arrow diagram for a link in a seifert fibered space , together with a list of ten generalized reidemeister moves that satisfy the request that two link diagrams represent the same link up to ambient isotopy if and only if there exists a finite sequence of generalized reidemeister moves between the two diagrams .    on the other hand we can consider studying links only up to difffeomorphism",
    ", i.e. we say that two links @xmath12 and @xmath13 are diffeo - equivalent if and only if there exists a self - diffeomorphism @xmath14 such that @xmath15 .",
    "this condition is weaker than ambient isotopy and we explore it in section  [ linkgroup ] by providing a method of calculating the group of a link which is able to detect diffeo - inequivalent links .    in section  [ linkhomology ] ,",
    "the link group is abelianized in order to obtain the first homology group of the complement . in some cases it is possible to recover it directly from the diagram , using the homology class of the link components . with some assumption on the manifold and on the link",
    ", it is possible to understand the behaviour of the rank and of the torsion of the homology .    in section  [ linktap ]",
    "we exploit the group presentation and the homology characterization to compute through fox calculus a class of twisted alexander polynomials , corresponding to a particular 1-dimensional representation of the link group .",
    "this particular class contains the usual alexander polynomial and a family of twisted polynomials that is able to keep track of the torsion of the group ; for example the polynomials of this family becomes zero on local links .",
    "moreover , as expected , the polynomials split under connected sum of links . at last , in section  [ linkexample ] , an example illustrates all the machinery developed .",
    "in order to define diagrams of knots inside seifert fibered spaces , we need to explicit their construction .",
    "let @xmath3 be a compact surface and let @xmath16 be the fundamental polygon of @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the equivalence relation that identifies the points on the boundary of the fundamental polygon as depicted on figure [ fig : polygons ] .",

    ", we have the identification @xmath22 of the edges ( figure  [ fig : poly1 ] ) , if @xmath3 is a sphere we have the identification @xmath23 ( figure  [ fig : poly2 ] ) , and if @xmath3 is a non - orientable genus @xmath24 surface , we have the identification @xmath25 ( figure  [ fig : poly3 ] ) .",
    "an arbitrary compact seifert fibered space @xmath0 can be constructed from @xmath16 as follows .",
    "take @xmath26 $ ] and by glueing each @xmath27 to @xmath28 , @xmath29 , we get the trivial circle bundle @xmath30 .",
    "since @xmath16 is a disk , we can orient all the fibers @xmath31 coherently .",
    "if two oriented edges @xmath32 and @xmath33 are identified in @xmath16 , in order to get @xmath3 , we can identify the tori @xmath34 and @xmath35 in two essentially different ways : @xmath34 is glued to @xmath35 by identity or by a reflection on the @xmath1 component . according to this ,",
    "we assign to each edge @xmath32 the sign @xmath36 and to each edge @xmath37 the sign @xmath38 . in both cases",
    "@xmath39 is chosen if the identification is made by the identity and @xmath40 otherwise .",
    "after the above identifications the resulting space is just a compact @xmath1-bundle over @xmath3 .",
    "we can get an arbitrary seifert fibered space by performing @xmath41-surgeries along a @xmath42 disjoint fibers @xmath43 , @xmath44 for @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are again two coprime integers , @xmath48 ; in our case we use the assumption @xmath49 , which is not restrictive , since , if we add a surgery with coefficients @xmath50 , we get the same result . ] .",
    "we remark that for an orientable seifert fibered space @xmath0 , the base space does not need to be oriented , but the values @xmath51 ( and @xmath52 ) are determined . in the case",
    "@xmath3 is orientable , @xmath53 and in the case @xmath3 in non - orientable @xmath54 for all @xmath55 .",
    "if a link @xmath56 lies in a thickened surface @xmath57 , the diagram of @xmath56 is just the regular projection of @xmath56 onto @xmath58 along with the information of under- and overcrossings with respect to the projection .",
    "if we present @xmath3 by its fundamental polygon , we obtain a set of curves in @xmath16 . by glueing @xmath59 to @xmath60",
    "we get a @xmath1-bundle @xmath0 over @xmath3 .",
    "we now map a link @xmath61 to @xmath3 by the induced projection @xmath62 and keep track of where @xmath56 passes the section @xmath59 by decorating the diagram with an arrow at the passage point , where the arrow indicates the direction we should travel along @xmath56 in order to cross @xmath63 and emerge from @xmath64 ( figure [ fig : arrows ] ) .",
    "let us remark that this induced projection agrees with the fibration @xmath65 in the case we do not have any exceptional fibers in @xmath0 .",
    "seif    seif    since the projection maps an exceptional fiber to a point in the base space , it is enough to specify the image of each exceptional fiber in @xmath16 , which is done by placing a point on @xmath16 decorated by the surgery coefficient @xmath66 of the fiber ( figure [ fig : diagram ] ) .",
    "we complete this section by providing a list of generalized reidemeister moves associated to the arrow diagrams . in the interior of @xmath16 and outside of exceptional fibers we have three classical moves reidemeister moves @xmath67 and two moves @xmath68 and @xmath69 involving arrows  @xcite(figure [ fig : reid1 ] ) .",
    "generalized reidemeister moves @xmath70  @xmath71 act across edges in @xmath16 ( figure  [ fig : reid2 ] ) .",
    "the move @xmath70 corresponds to pushing an arc over an edge  @xcite , @xmath72 corresponds to pushing a crossing over the edge and comes in two variants : @xmath73 in the case @xmath3 is orientable and @xmath74 in the case @xmath3 is non - orientable  @xcite .",
    "the move @xmath75 corresponds to pushing an arrow over an edge , where the sign denotes the sign associated to the edge  @xcite .",
    "the move @xmath71 corresponds to pushing an arc over the base point of @xmath16 and is similar to the move @xmath76 in  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath71 move comes in three flavours : if @xmath16 is a orientable genus @xmath21 surface we have @xmath77 , if @xmath16 is the 2-sphere we have @xmath78 , and if @xmath16 is a non - orientable surface we have the move @xmath79 .",
