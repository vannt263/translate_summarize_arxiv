    "we note that these advanced statistical techniques stand in contrast to the relative simplicity of our model ; our goal of measuring the ranges of allowed disk architectures motivates the expenditure of computational resources in the exploration of parameter space rather than the complexity of the underlying disk model .",
    "the mcmc framework uses a markov chain , consisting of a series of states @xmath87 , to explore the parameter space and sample the posterior .",
    "a requirement of mcmc methods is an algorithm for randomly choosing states in the markov chain .",
    "given a state @xmath88 , the metropolis - hastings algorithm provides a general - purpose method for randomly choosing the subsequent state @xmath89 based on a candidate transition function ( commonly gaussian ) .",

    "the use of mcmc in astrophysical data analysis has grown in recent years ; a summary of this technique and an application to quantify uncertainty in orbit fitting is given by  @xcite .",
    "when addressing questions about the physical properties of the disk , we are sometimes interested only in the range of a subset of parameters allowed by the model . in the bayesian framework , the distribution of a parameter ( or joint distribution of a subset of parameters ) is obtained through marginalization .",

    "therefore the uniform prior for @xmath97 plays a role in shaping the posterior distribution in model ii , and the likelihood function is only able to exclude values in the upper end of the range . for all other variables ,",
    "the likelihood function is sharply peaked compared to the relatively flat priors ; therefore their results are insensitive our choice of prior .",
    "the spatial locations and inferred sizes of the thermally emitting grains are largely consistent with the dust seen in scattered light .",
    "@xcite find that the scattered - light disk is symmetric for @xmath150 , which overlaps with the symmetric mid - ir emission we measure in   [ subsec : psfsub ] .",
    "the inner edge of the warm dust ring ( @xmath151507 ) corresponds to the outer boundary of the scattered - light brightness asymmetry seen inward of 05 .",
    "a comparison of the ne and sw _ f110w _ surface brightness profiles shows the sw ansa is @xmath152 times brighter than the ne at 05 . integrating the disk light in each ansa from @xmath153 ,  @xcite find the total ne ( sw ) emission to be @xmath154mjy ( @xmath155mjy ) , which corresponds to a ne - sw fractional flux difference of @xmath156 . in comparison to the scattered light , in the _ _ n__@xmath0-band image we do not find an increasing brightness trend for the sw ansa inward of 06 , nor do we find evidence for asymmetry in this region . how can the emission appear asymmetric in scattered light , but symmetric in thermal emission ?",
    "one possibility is that the grains responsible for the scattered - light asymmetry reside inward of the warm ring . in this case",
    ", they must have properties that differ from the majority of grains in the inner disk , which scatter light in the symmetric component .",
    "if the asymmetrically distributed grains have a significantly higher albedo or larger average size , they may not be apparent in the thermal emission .",
    "future observations of scattered light at different wavelengths may constrain such changes in grain properties with position .",
    "another possibility is that the asymmetry is produced by a density enhancement at sufficient distance from the star such that its grains do not produce significant _ _",
    "n__@xmath0-band emission relative to the warm ring .    for @xmath1570.5  and reasonable assumptions on grain composition and size distribution  (  [ subsubsec : model_constr ] ) , we find @xmath1580.1 . as noted in   [ subsubsec : model_results ] , in the _ r _ and _ f110w _ bands , submicron grains will scatter blue as their sizes approach the rayleigh regime , consistent with the blue color of dust scattered light inferred by  @xcite .",
    "this lends support to the contention that the scattered - light images and thermal image presented here are probing similar populations of grains .",
    "simultaneous modeling of the scattered light and thermal emission , deferred for future work , has the potential to strongly constrain grain sizes , locations , and composition for the bulk of the inner disk .",
    "these observations are a stepping stone to understanding the nature of the disk and source of its structure .",
    "however , we lack direct evidence for the age of the system , which complicates such analysis . based on the stellar distance and galactic space motion , @xcite argues for an age @xmath1130myr based on the system s possible association with the gould belt or recent star formation in the taurus - aurigae association . as we will show in the following calculations",
    ", this age indicates that the grains in the inner disk are likely not primordial and must be replenished . in the next subsection",
    ", we seek to estimate orders of magnitude for processes governing grain production and removal for the sizes and spatial locations in the innermost disk .      assuming the radiative coupling efficiency averaged over the stellar spectrum @xmath159 , a grain density of 2g@xmath160 , and @xmath161@xmath162 , the fiducial radiation pressure blow - out size is",
    "@xmath163  @xcite . in the absence of forces other than radiation and gravity , grains smaller than this size",
    "are removed from the system on the free - fall timescale , @xmath164yr . at first glance , this would imply that production of submicron grains must be extremely rapid .",
    "however , our conversion from @xmath55 to the geometric size @xmath165 is quite uncertain , and may be too small by a factor of @xmath166  ( if the grains are weakly absorbing and have a size distribution steeper than @xmath167 ; * ? ? ?",
    "another possibility , which maintains consistency with submicron scattered - light grains , is that drag forces can increase the residence time of the grains undergoing ejection .",
    "finally , we note that @xmath168 is not a strict lower limit to the steady - state size distribution .",
    "as noted by  @xcite , very small grains ( sizes much less than the peak wavelength of stellar radiation ) couple inefficiently to the radiation field , such that @xmath169 and the radiation force can not overcome gravity .",
    "for such small grains , composition and porosity can can play a crucial role in the residence time due to their effects on the optical constants .",
    "for example ,  @xcite show in their fig .  1 that around an a5v star , silicate grains are blown out regardless of size or porosity .",
    "in contrast , the smallest icy grains can remain bound .",
    "compact icy grains have a blow - out size of 3 , whereas @xmath168 for grains with 80% porosity drops to 0.7 . because of their small @xmath170 , the radiation pressure on 80% porous , icy grains smaller than 0.05  is insufficient to overcome gravity .",
    "this cutoff size decreases to @xmath171  for more compact icy grains .",
    "we conclude that our model grain sizes may be compatible with the steady - state size distribution arising from radiation pressure . and note that this mechanism provides a natural separation between a population of small ( @xmath172 ) grains and a population of grains larger than @xmath168 .",
    "collisions may play a significant role in the lifetimes of grains in the inner disk , as fragments from a catastrophically dispersed grain can be rapidly removed via radiation pressure . for a low - eccentricity disk of single - size particles ,",
    "the timescale between mutual collisions is @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the orbital frequency and @xmath175 is the geometric vertical optical depth .",
    "we find @xmath176yr .",
    "calculation of this timescale from our models is complicated by the unknown absorption efficiency , as @xmath177 .",
    "we also note that the timescale for _ destructive _ collisions is likely different from the above @xmath178 , and it must account for the unknown grain size and velocity distributions .",
    "the presence of a gas disk can damp relative velocities , increasing the timescale for destructive collisions .",
    "these damping forces can also cause grains to settle in the midplane , causing the disk to be very thin in vertical extent  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "observations of the disk scale height may constrain the presence of gas and its effect on collisional timescales . our models in   [ subsec : modeling ] show that the mid - ir image is consistent with an edge - on , vertically unresolved disk .",
    "more work is needed in modeling scattered - light images ( at higher spatial resolution ) to determine if the apparent disk thickness is the result of vertical extent or inclination effects .",
    "alternately , it may be possible to constrain the gas density through modeling of the dust density s radial structure , as has been done for @xmath142pic  .",
    "regardless , future dynamical models of the inner disk must make a detailed accounting grain - grain collisions .",
    "drag forces can decrease the periastra of grain orbits , filling the inner disk with material .",
    "assuming circular orbits , the poynting - robertson drag timescale at radius @xmath179 is @xmath180yr .",
    "this is significantly longer than @xmath181yr , suggesting p - r drag is dynamically unimportant for the radii of warm dust emission  ( though it may allow some mid - ir emitting dust in systems without planets ; see * ? ? ?",
    "the detection of a potentially massive gas disk by  @xcite suggests that gas drag may affect the grains in this system .",
    "as noted above , the role of gas drag in the inner disk is difficult to estimate due to our ignorance of the gas disk s density distribution and physical state , and no physical features ( such as sharp outer edges of dust rings or midplane settling ) currently provide such indications  .    an interesting physical result from our models",
    "are the warm temperatures of the effective grains at the inner rim of the dust annulus [ @xmath182200k ] . at these temperatures ,",
    "the sublimation of water ice in small grains is efficient ( @xmath183yr ) , suggesting no water is present in grains at this distance from the star .",
    "however , this process is a strong function of temperature  , and therefore stellar distance ( eq .  [ eq : temp ] ) . at a distance of @xmath184",
    ", a 0.2  water ice grain has @xmath185myr .",
    "this raises the possibility that , rather than being the location of grain creation and outward diffusion , the inner edge of the warm dust disk is the destruction site for icy inspiraling grains . for this to be the case",
    ", drag forces must overcome radiation pressure and destructive collisions for a significant population of icy grains .",
    "the inference of the physical processes responsible for the disk structure ( and that govern its evolution ) are unclear .",
    "direct spectroscopic evidence of the stellar age is still needed .",
    "furthermore , the spatial distribution of the gas disk is an important direction for future observations .",
    "this system is attractive for the direct detection of gas emission , similar to observations of @xmath142pic  @xcite .",
    "the next modeling steps should combine the available data , including the resolved scattered light , thermal emission , and sed .",
