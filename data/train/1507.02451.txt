    "consider a point particle of mass @xmath0 in @xmath1 , @xmath2 moving in a random distribution of fixed scatterers , whose centers are denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "+ we assume that the scatterers are distributed according to a poisson distribution of parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath5 here @xmath6 denote position and velocity of the test particle , @xmath7 the time and @xmath8 for any time dependent variable @xmath9 .    to outline a kinetic behavior it is usually introduced a scaling of the space - time variables and the density of the scatterer distribution .",
    "for this model , it is more physically intuitive to transfer the scaling to the background medium .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath10 be a parameter indicating the ratio between the macroscopic and microscopic variables , we keep time and space fixed and rescale the range of the interaction and the density of the scatterers , i.e. @xmath11 where @xmath2 is the dimension of the physical space and @xmath12 $ ] is a suitable parameter .",
    "this means that the probability of finding @xmath13 obstacles in a bounded measurable set @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "consequently , the equation of motion becomes @xmath18 now let @xmath19 be the hamiltonian flow solution to equation with initial datum @xmath6 in a given sample of obstacles ( skipping the @xmath20 dependence for notational simplicity ) and , for a given probability distribution @xmath21 , consider the quantity @xmath22\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the expectation with respect to the measure @xmath24 given by .    in the limit @xmath25 we expect that the probability distribution will solve a linear kinetic equation depending on the value of @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath27 the limit corresponding to such a scaling is called low - density ( or boltzmann - grad ) limit . in this case @xmath28 converges to the solution of a linear boltzmann equation .",
    "see @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath29 the corresponding limit , called weak - coupling limit , yields the linear landau equation , as proven in @xcite .",
    "the intermediate scaling , namely @xmath30 , although refers to a low - density regime , leads to the linear landau equation again , see @xcite .    we want to remark that in @xcite the authors exploit the original constructive idea due to gallavotti ( see @xcite ) for the boltzmann - grad limit .",
    "this method is based on a suitable change of variables which can be implemented outside a set @xmath31 of pathological events which prevent the markov property of the limit ( such as the set of configurations yielding recollisions , i.e. when the test particle recollides with a given obstacle after having suffered collisions with other different obstacles ) .",
    "the probability @xmath32 is vanishing as @xmath33 tends to 0 .",
    "the main difference is that in @xcite the range of the potential is infinite in the limit , therefore the test particle interacts with infinitely many obstacles .",
    "as for the case of the long range potential considered in @xcite also in @xcite there is a lack of the semi explicit form of the solution of the limit equation .",
    "this requires explicit estimates for the set of bad configurations of obstacles . for a short range potential , like in the case of the hard - sphere potential considered in @xcite ,",
    "a simple dimensional argument is sufficient . for an explicit control of the error in the kinetic limit for",
    "the hard - sphere potential see for instance @xcite .",
    "moreover , in @xcite it was proven that even if @xmath34 , but sufficiently small , the recollisions are still negligible .",
    "incidentally we note that , if @xmath26 is close to @xmath35 , this is not true anymore and it would be interesting to derive the landau equation in this regime , by means of an explicit constructive approach .        furthermore it has been observed that the presence of a given external field , in the two dimensional lorentz model , strongly affects the derivation of the linear boltzmann equation in the boltzmann - grad limit .",
    "bobylev et al , in @xcite and later in @xcite ( see also @xcite for further readings ) , showed that the set of pathological configurations is no longer negligible when the test particle moves in a plane with a poisson distribution of hard disks and a uniform and constant magnetic field perpendicular to the plane .",
    "see figure [ fig : hardsphere ] for a pictorial representation of the light particle s motion .",
    "the following simple computation turns out to give a good heuristic argument explaining these results : consider the probability @xmath36 of performing an entire larmor circle without hitting any obstacle , @xmath37 being the larmor radius . from equation ( [ poisson ] )",
    "one easily gets @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the annulus of radius @xmath40 and width @xmath33 .",
    "hence , @xmath41 is not vanishing in the limit @xmath42 and the markovianity of the limit system can not be attained .",
    "in fact , in @xcite , a kinetic equation with memory is derived , i.e. a generalized boltzmann equation , taking into account those effects : @xmath43}e^{-\\nu k t_l}\\int_{s_1}dn\\,(v\\cdot n)\\\\&\\quad\\ , [ \\chi(v\\cdot n)b_n+\\chi(-v\\cdot n)]f^{g}(x , s_0^{-k}v , t - kt_l ) , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the probability density of finding the moving particle at time @xmath7 at position @xmath45 with velocity @xmath46 and @xmath47 here",
    "@xmath48 is the collision frequency and @xmath49 is the cyclotron period where @xmath50 is the frequency , being @xmath51 the charge and @xmath52 the mass .",
    "furthermore , note that @xmath53 is the generator of the free cyclotron motion with frequency @xmath54 and @xmath55 $ ] the number of cyclotron periods @xmath56 completed before time @xmath7 .",
    "the angular integration over the unit vector @xmath57 in is over the entire unit sphere @xmath58 centered at the origin . in the gain term",
    "the operator @xmath59 is defined by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is an arbitrary function of @xmath46 .",
    "the precollisional velocity @xmath62 becomes @xmath46 after the elastic collision with the hard disk .",
    "note that @xmath63 . in the loss term , the precollisional velocity @xmath46 is also from the hemisphere @xmath64 .",
    "finally , the shift operator @xmath65 , when acting on @xmath46 , rotates the velocity through the angle @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the scattering angle ( from @xmath68 to @xmath46 ) .    for further readings in this direction we refer to @xcite , where the authors consider a stochastic lorentz model with a smooth external force field @xmath69 and with absorbing obstacles , i.e. the interaction between the obstacles and the test particle is such that the test particle disappears whenever it enters an obstacle .",
    "it is proved that the kinetic equation associated to this model in the boltzmann - grad limit is non - markovian and that the markovianity can be recovered by introducing an additional stochasticity in the velocity distribution of the obstacles .    in this paper",
    "we consider the case of a random distribution of scatterers in @xmath70 where each obstacle generates a smooth positive and short - range potential @xmath71 , with @xmath34 and sufficiently small .",
    "we show that , in this case , the solution of the microscopic dynamics converges , in the intermediate limit ( when @xmath72 ) , to the solution of the linear landau equation with an additional transport term due to the magnetic field . from the heuristic point of view , this result is suggested by the observation that in this case the probability @xmath36 of performing an entire larmor circle without hitting any obstacle is given by @xmath73 which vanishes as @xmath74 .",
    "this computation shows that one family of the pathological events preventing the markovianity is negligible in this setting .",
    "we stress that this rough argument is not sufficient to conclude that we can recover the markovianity in the limit . indeed , to prove this , we need to show that all the other bad configurations of obstacles defining the set @xmath75 are negligible in the limit , as we will see in section [ n : pat ] .",
    "furthermore , we observe that even if we consider a long range inverse power law interaction potential , truncated at distance @xmath76 with @xmath77 suitably large , in the low density regime @xmath27 , we can prove that the memory is lost in the limit .",
    "more precisely , we prove that the microscopic solution converges to the solution of the uncutoffed linear boltzmann equation with a magnetic transport term . with the same purpose of the rough argument presented above",
    ", we observe that the probability @xmath36 of performing a complete larmor circle without hitting any obstacle is approximatively given by @xmath78 which vanishes as @xmath42 when @xmath79 .",
    "also in this case this represents only one example of bad configuration of scatterers .",
    "it is essential to prove that the contribution of the whole set of pathological events is negligible in the limit , as we will show in section [ bounds_boltzmann ] .",
    "moreover , from the technical point of view , we observe that the parameter @xmath80 has to be chosen close to @xmath81 as dictated by the explicit control of the memory effects .",
    "thus , as we pointed out with the heuristic motivations above , the non - markovian behaviour of the limit process , discussed in @xcite , disappears as soon as we slightly modify the microscopic model given by the two dimensional lorentz gas .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide a rigorous validation of the linear landau equation and the linear boltzmann equation respectively with magnetic field by using the constructive strategy due to gallavotti .",
    "we remark that , as in @xcite , we need explicit estimates of the error in the kinetic limit and this is the crucial part .",
    "moreover , as a future target , it could be interesting to understand if a rigorous derivation of the generalized boltzmann equation proposed in @xcite can be achieved by using the same constructive techniques .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in the next section we establish the model and formulate the results ; in section [ proofs ] we present the strategy of the proofs , whereas sections [ n : sec : st ] and [ bounds_boltzmann ] are dedicated to the nontrivial analysis and explicit estimates of the sets of bad configurations producing memory effects , which is the technical core of this paper .",
