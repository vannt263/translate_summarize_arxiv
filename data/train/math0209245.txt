    "given a representation @xmath0 of a unimodular , separable locally compact group @xmath1 , we want to discuss the existence and characterization of vectors giving rise to coherent state expansions on @xmath2 . for this purpose ,",
    "a vector @xmath3 is called * bounded * if the coefficient operator @xmath4 is a bounded map .",
    "we are interested in inverting this operator , hence the following notion is natural : a pair of bounded vectors @xmath5 is called * admissible * if @xmath6 is the identity operator on @xmath2 . note that this property gives rise to the weak - sense inversion formula @xmath7 which can be read as a continuous expansion of @xmath8 in terms of the orbit @xmath9 .",
    "identities of this type are known as * coherent state expansion * in mathematical physics .",
    "a single vector @xmath10 is called admissible if @xmath11 is an admissible pair .",
    "it is obvious from the definition that @xmath5 is admissible iff @xmath12 is .",
    "in such a case @xmath10 is called the * dual vector * of @xmath13 .",
    "admissible vectors were first discussed almost exclusively in connection with irreducible , so - called _ discrete series _ or _ square - integrable _ representations @xcite .",
    "the existence of admissible vectors for these representations is a fairly straightforward consequence of schur s lemma , and slightly more complicated in the nonunimodular case .",
    "recently exhaustive criteria for the existence and characterization of admissible vectors were established for the case that the regular representation @xmath14 of @xmath1 is type i , using the plancherel formula of the group . however , if we want to include discrete groups in this general discussion , the type i restriction is rather too rigid .",
    "indeed , a discrete group @xmath1 has a type i regular representation iff @xmath1 itself is type i @xcite , and the latter is only the case if @xmath1 is a finite extension of an abelian normal subgroup @xcite .",
    "let us now give a short survey of the paper .",
    "it initiated from the idea to replace the decomposition into irreducibles by the central decomposition of @xmath14 , and to try to come up with criteria using the latter .",
    "this however requires an understanding of how admissible vectors are recognised in terms of their image under the central decomposition .",
    "the main result of this paper , theorem [ thm : main ] , provides the key to this problem , by relating admissibility to the natural trace on the von neumann algebra @xmath15 .",
    "since the trace decomposes , the problem of characterizing admissible pairs can be translated to the characterization of tracial pairs for the fibre von neumann algebras of the central decomposition ( proposition [ prop : adm_fibres ] ) . as an application of this result",
    "we obtain a characterization of admissible pairs in the case that @xmath14 is type i ( theorem [ thm : adm_fibres_typei ] ) .",
    "a slightly weaker version of this result had been proved , by somewhat different arguments , in an earlier paper ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.6 ) ) . in the final section",
    "we sketch how the trace criterion gives rise to admissibility criteria in terms of certain orthogonality relations . as a special case",
    "we obtain the wexler - raz biorthogonality relations in gabor analysis .",
    "throughout the paper , @xmath1 denotes a separable unimodular locally compact group , and @xmath0 a ( unitary , strongly continuous ) representation of @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath14 is the * left regular representation * , acting on @xmath16 by @xmath17 .",
    "we denote the commuting algebra of @xmath14 as @xmath15 , the * right group von neumann algebra*.    our definitions and notations regarding the group hilbert algebra are taken from @xcite . in order to define the group hilbert algebra , we let for @xmath18 , and additionally either @xmath19 or @xmath20 in @xmath21 , @xmath22 the ( full ) group hilbert algebra consists of all @xmath23 for which @xmath24 extends to a bounded operator .",
    "note that these operators then lie in @xmath15 .",
    "writing @xmath25 , we note that @xmath26 .",
    "hence the bounded vectors are precisely the elements of the full hilbert algebra .",
    "we note in passing that the full hilbert algebra contains the dense subspace @xmath27 of @xmath16 .",
    "let us recall the definition of a trace . given a von neumann algebra @xmath28 ,",
    "we let @xmath29 denote the cone of positive elements .",

    "note the conventions @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "* @xmath37 , for all @xmath38 and all unitary @xmath39 .",

    "@xmath40 is * finite * if @xmath41 .",
    "a trace @xmath40 uniquely extends to a linear functional on the two - sided ideal @xmath42 for finite traces this is obviously @xmath28 itself .",
    "we will denote the extension by @xmath40 as well .",

    "we expect most of these statements to be widely known .",

    "part ( a ) is immediate , and ( d ) then follows from ( c ) .",
    "the first statement of ( b ) is obvious . for the existence of a dual vector , we observe that @xmath54 is a strictly positive operator with bounded inverse .",
    "hence @xmath55 is bounded , i.e. , @xmath56 is a bounded vector .",
    "the computation @xmath57 shows that @xmath13 is a dual vector .",
    "a similar calculation shows @xmath58 , i.e. , @xmath59 .",
    "hence , for the proof of minimality of @xmath60 ( which is the only thing left to show ) , we may assume that @xmath49 , and that @xmath50 is left translation on @xmath61 .",
    "then the commuting algebra @xmath62 is readily identified as the * reduced von neumann algebra * @xmath63 , where @xmath64 denotes the projection onto @xmath61 .",

    "( [ eqn : trace_vn ] ) entails for @xmath66 @xmath67 hence @xmath68 , and @xmath60 is indeed minimal .",
    "the characterization of admissible vectors in terms of the trace requires one more piece of notation : given a particular trace @xmath40 on a von neumann algebra @xmath28 , we call a pair of elements @xmath5 of the underlying hilbert space * tracial * if @xmath69    [ thm : main ] let @xmath70 be a closed , leftinvariant subspace , with associated leftinvariant projection @xmath64 , and let @xmath50 denote the restriction of @xmath14 to @xmath61 .    1",

    "conversely , assuming traciality of @xmath5 , the above calculation yields @xmath87 for all bounded vectors . by polarization",
    "this leads to @xmath88 for all bounded vectors @xmath89 , and since these are dense , @xmath90 follows .",
    "the equivalent conditions from part @xmath73 imply in particular that @xmath62 is a finite von neumann algebra",

    "in this section we consider the central decomposition of the regular representation and its use for the characterization of admissible pairs .",
    "in particular we recover the characterization obtained in @xcite for the case that @xmath14 is type i. the following facts concerning the central decomposition of @xmath14 can be found in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath93 denote the space of quasi - equivalence classes of factor representations of @xmath1 , endowed with the natural borel structure .",
    "then there exists a standard positive measure @xmath94 on @xmath93 , and a measurable field of factor representations @xmath95 , for @xmath94-almost every @xmath96 , such that @xmath97 the operator effecting the unitary equivalence is called the * plancherel transform*. moreover , the direct integral provides a decomposition of @xmath15 and the natural trace : @xmath98 for a measurable family of von neumann algebras @xmath99 on @xmath100 , as well as @xmath101 when @xmath102 denotes the operator field corresponding to @xmath103 under the central decomposition , and @xmath104 is a faithful normal , semifinite trace on the factor @xmath99 , which exists for @xmath94-almost every @xmath96 . in particular , @xmath94-almost every @xmath99 is of type i or ii .",

    "we wish to point out that the admissibility criteria , however abstract they may appear , have been made explicit for certain classes of representations , in particular for multiplicity - free representations .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of quasiregular representations of semidirect product groups , and @xcite for a treatment of weyl - heisenberg frames with integer sampling ratio .",
    "another interesting class of representations are the factor subrepresentations of the regular representation , i.e. , the atoms in the central decomposition , and the elements of their quasi - equivalence classes .",

    "we will then demonstrate that the wexler - raz biorthogonality relations are a special instance of this approach .",
