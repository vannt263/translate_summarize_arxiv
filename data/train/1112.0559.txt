    "coherent states ( css ) play an important role in quantum optics and modern physics @xcite . along different kinds of generalization of coherent states",
    "@xcite , nonlinear css @xcite or @xmath1-css @xmath2 @xcite have been introduced and attracted much attention in recent decade @xcite-@xcite with the fock space representation as @xcite : @xmath3!)^2}\\right)^{-1/2 }       \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty }   \\frac{\\alpha^n } { \\sqrt{n ! }   [ f(n ) ] ! }   |n\\rangle ,       \\qquad\\alpha=|\\alpha|e^{i\\varphi } ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4!\\doteq f(1 ) f(2 ) ... f(n)$ ] .",
    "according to this formalism , @xmath1-deformed annihilation and creation operators , respectively are defined as @xmath5 and so @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are bosonic annihilation , creation and number operator , respectively . here , the ( real ) intensity - dependent function @xmath9 is responsible for the nonlinearity of the states . on the other side , jaynes - cummings model ( jcm )",
    "is the simplest nontrivial example of the atom - field interaction , i.e. , a two - level atom and a single - mode radiation field @xcite . as a few recent works in this topics see refs .",
    "the dynamical behaviour of the nonlinear atom - field interaction in the presence of classical gravity using the nonlinear coherent states approach discussed in @xcite .",
    "buzek generalized the jcm @xcite and the atom - field coupling is considered to be intensity - dependent and supposed that the cavity field be in the gilmore - perelomov ( gp ) nonlinear cs of @xmath0 group @xcite .",
    "the author showed that , the revivals of the radiation squeezing are strictly periodical for any value of initial squeezing parameter @xcite .",
    "more recently , koroli _ et al _ @xcite studied the interaction of an equidistant three - level atom ( ion ) , whose dipole moment matrix transition elements between the adjacent atomic levels are different , with the gp cs of @xmath0 group .",
    "they showed that , in the three - level model with the intensity - dependent coupling , the exact periodicity of the squeezing revivals is violated .    in the present paper ,",
    "due to the great interest in the atom - field interactions in the quantum optics , we regard the same configuration of three - level atom ( ion ) has been considered in @xcite , however we generalize the initial state of the field to the `` nonlinear cs '' with arbitrary `` nonlinearity function '' @xmath9 . in our formalism , the atom - field coupling is also considered to be intensity - dependent , characterized by a function @xmath10 , which is generally different from @xmath9 .",
    "while in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors have concerned with special nonlinearities , our presentation deals , in principle , with two distinct general nonlinearity functions and interestingly , the exact solution is also obtained for the time evolved entire states of the system .    after finding the explicit solution of the state vector , which evidently depends on @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    ", we will treat the time evolution of the mean photon number and atomic population inversion , as well as a few non - classicality features such as sub - poissonian statistics and squeezing of the quadratures of the field .",
    "therefore , in contrast to the approach of @xcite , that investigated only a special system , i.e. , holstein - primakoff @xmath11 coherent states as filed state and @xmath12 as the coupling between atom and field , our formalism can be applied to the intensity - dependent interaction between the same three - level atom with arbitrary cavity field that is initially prepared in a generalized cs with known `` nonlinearity function @xmath9 '' .",
    "interestingly , apart from the mentioned advantage , as we will observe , our presented formalism allows one to work with the general case in which two different nonlinearity functions exist , one indicates the initial state of the field ( @xmath9 ) , and the other to the atom - field intensity dependent coupling ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "although , it can simply recover the work of buzek @xcite and koroli _ et al _ @xcite , as some special cases . in the continuation ,",
    "the formalism has been applied to two classes of generalized css , i.e. , two distinct representations of @xmath0 css .",
    "in addition , in opposite of the work has been done in @xcite , in which the authors have taken @xmath13 and @xmath14 , we choose @xmath15 , i.e. , the nonlinearity of the initial state is taken to be the same as the intensity - dependent coupling function .",
    "finally , in each of the considered cases , we discuss the numerical results have been shown in several figures in detail and compare with earlier works . along this procedure",
    ", some new physical features reveals , which may be emphasized .",
    "for instance , a typical collapse and revival phenomenon ( as a pure quantum mechanical feature ) in physical quantities such as mean photon number , atomic population inversion and mandel parameter , and the appearance of some non - classicality signs , are specific aspects may be highlighted .",
    "we consider the interaction of an equidistant three - level atom in a cascade configuration with different dipole moment matrix transition elements between the adjacent atomic energy levels ( shown in figure 1 ) with a quantized single - mode cavity field of frequency @xmath16 .",
    "the states @xmath17 and @xmath18 are respectively denoted the ground , first and second excited states . only the atomic transitions between @xmath17 and also @xmath19 are dipole allowed , but not between @xmath20 .",
    "the hamiltonian of such an atom - field system is given by : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the sum of the hamiltonians of atom and field , i.e. , @xmath23 @xmath24 denotes the atomic population inversion operator .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian between atom and field in ( [ h0,h1 ] ) in the dipole and rotating wave approximation is given by : @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the atom - field coupling constants .",
    "a useful approach to the atom - field interaction problem may be found in the `` interaction picture '' @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the interaction between the mentioned atom - field , in the interaction picture , is described by @xmath27 where , @xmath28 is the detuning .",
    "now , we suppose that the atom - field coupling is intensity dependent , expressed by @xmath10 , so the intensity - dependent hamiltonian in the interaction picture is given by : @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath10 describes the intensity - dependent coupling between atom and field .",
    "notice that , @xmath32 and @xmath33 in ( [ h1 ] ) have the same structure and also meaning of @xmath34 and @xmath35 were described at the beginning of this section , except that a different nonlinearity function is considered .",
    "our different notation is only for the distinction between the nonlinearity of the initial state of the field and the intensity dependent coupling function .",
    "we have assumed that @xmath10 is a real well - defined function with no singularity .",
    "the hamiltonian in ( [ hi ] ) plays a crucial role in determining the subsequent dynamics of the quantum states of a variety of ( three - level ) atom - field systems , some of them will be considered in the continuation of the paper .",
    "let the atom be initially in the first excited state @xmath36 and the cavity field is prepared in a generalized cs with a nonlinear cs as given in ( [ baste nonl ] ) .",
    "the state of the atom - field system at @xmath37 can be expressed as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is determined as the expansion coefficients of the states in ( [ baste nonl ] ) , according to the initial cs has been chosen . a useful approach to the atom - field interaction problem",
    "may be found in the interaction picture @xcite .",
    "the schrdinger representation of a state vector @xmath40 , in terms of its interaction picture representation @xmath41 , is given by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 .",
    "also , @xmath41 can be obtained from @xmath44 consequently , by using the above relations , one can straightforwardly find the time evolution of the state vector of the coupled atom - field system in the resonance condition @xmath45 as follows : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we will call @xmath49 which is the scaled time briefly as time .",
    "it is worth noticing that @xmath50 which is appeared in the exponential functions in ( [ state vec sys ] ) has the operational role ( number operator ) , the same as the role of @xmath51 .",
    "anyway , this solution is very general and gives the time evolution of a system that is involved a single - mode cavity field , has been prepared in a generalized cs , coupled with an equidistant three - level atom in a cascade configuration with different dipole moment matrix transition elements between the adjacent levels @xmath52 .",
    "two specific cases can be recovered : ( 1 ) when @xmath53 , it is equivalent to the single two - level atom ; and ( 2 ) when @xmath54 it corresponds to an equal dipole moment matrix transition elements between the adjacent levels .",
    "this case is indeed equivalent to a pair of indistinguishable two - level atoms @xcite .",
    "the states of the atomic pair can be described in the three - level states representation : ( i ) the ground state is equivalent to the case in which both atoms of the pair are in the ground state ; ( ii ) the first exited state describes the case in which one atom of the pair is in the ground state and another atom is in the exited state , and ( iii ) in the second exited state , both atoms of the pair are in the exited state .",
    "in addition to the generality of our presented formalism , another advantage of our formalism is that it contains two distinct nonlinearity functions , i.e. , @xmath9 corresponding to initial state of the field and @xmath10 which determines the intensity - dependent coupling between atom and field .",
    "so , we can easily recover the results in @xcite , if we take @xmath13 and @xmath14 and also in @xcite , if we take @xmath13 , @xmath14 with @xmath55 , as some special cases .",
    "also , we can work with other different possibilities , especially the case @xmath56 and @xmath57 , investigate the output results and compare with @xcite .",
    "after determining the state vector of the atom - field system at any arbitrary time obtained in ( [ state vec sys ] ) , we are able to investigate mean photon number , atomic population inversion , mandel parameter and squeezing parameters as some non - classicality criteria .      using the explicit form of atom - field system @xmath40 in ( [ state vec sys ] ) , the mean photon number can be readily found for any system , with arbitrary @xmath9 and @xmath10 as follows : @xmath58      atomic population inversion , as the expectation value of @xmath59 , is defined as @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the probabilities of the presence of the atom in @xmath18 and @xmath63 states , respectively . with the help of @xmath40 in ( [ state vec sys ] ) , @xmath64 can be written as : @xmath65 as a special case , in the absence of the radiation field inside the cavity , namely , the cavity field being in the vacuum state @xmath66 , the quantity @xmath67 is given by : @xmath68 recall that , the atom is initially in @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , in the absence of a driving field , the atom in the lower state @xmath36 , can not excite to the upper state @xmath18 , so @xmath69 and from ( [ sz expectation value ] ) one has @xmath70 by the comparison of ( [ sz expectation value 0 ] ) and ( [ sz expectation value 01 ] ) , one can arrive at @xmath71 which means that in the fully quantum theory of radiation , transition from the upper state to the lower state in the vacuum of the field becomes possible , known as the spontaneous emission .",
    "it is to be noted that this result can not be predicted by semiclassical radiation theory .      to examine the statistics of the states , mandel s @xmath72-parameter",
    "is widely used , characterizes the quantum statistics of the states inside the cavity .",
    "this parameter has been defined as @xmath73 @xcite , where @xmath74 obtained in ( [ mean phot num ] ) and @xmath75 may be calculated as follows : @xmath76 the mandel s @xmath72-parameter obviously depends on the particular choice of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath72 is positive for classical states ( super - poissonian ) , negative for non - classical states ( sub - poissonian ) and vanishes for canonical css ( poissonian ) .",
    "also , we will investigate the squeezing properties of the quadratures of the field .",
    "for this purpose , we introduce field quadratures as @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the operators @xmath80 to study the squeezing properties , we introduce the squeezing parameters : @xmath81 where @xmath82 corresponds to squeezing effect in @xmath83 and satisfies the inequalities @xmath84 .",
    "obviously , to preserve the heisenberg uncertainty relation , when @xmath85 is negative , @xmath86 should be positive .",
    "to calculate the parameters @xmath82 numerically , one has to find the mean values of the operators : @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the following results are easily obtained : @xmath89 where @xmath90\\right\\ }     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath91\\right\\}.     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] clearly , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "it should be noticed that @xmath94 and @xmath95 are real values . finally , using the above expressions we arrive at @xmath96 + 4 \\;\\cos ^2(\\varphi ) \\;[b_{2}(\\tau)-b_{1 } ^{2}(\\tau ) ] ,     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath97 + 4",
    "\\;\\sin ^2(\\varphi ) \\;[b_{2}(\\tau)-b_{1 } ^{2}(\\tau ) ] ,     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath98 .",
    "in this section , we firstly consider the special simple case @xmath99 and then nonlinearity functions of css of @xmath0 group are considered .      in this subsection",
    "it will be constructive to consider canonical coherent state as the initial state of the field and suppose that the coupling between ( the three - level ) atom and field be independent of intensity , namely @xmath99 .",
    "the quantities that have been presented in section 4 , are plotted versus time for this special case . from figures 2 - 4",
    "it is seen that mean photon number , atomic population inversion and mandel parameter have nearly complete collapses and revivals , at least at intermediate times .",
    "this quantities collapses to @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "atomic population inversion is positive .",
    "this means that the probability of the presence of the atom in @xmath18 is greater than being in @xmath63 .",
    "mandel parameter is negative in some time intervals , namely the state of the system possesses sub - poissonian statistics .",
    "squeezing parameters versus time is shown in fig .",
    "5 . there is no squeezing in @xmath103 and nearly in @xmath104 , too if one ignores the very weak squeezing that may be seen about @xmath105 .      at this stage of the paper , as an example of initial nonlinear cs , we will consider the holestein - primakoff single - mode realization of @xmath11 lie algebra . before we proceed",
    ", it is worth noticing that , the equivalence of the discrete series representation of @xmath11 state space @xmath106 , with @xmath107 , and the harmonic oscillator hilbert space @xmath108 is illustrated in @xcite .",
    "based on this recognition , @xmath11 css have been well established as nonlinear css by ali et al @xcite .",
    "we briefly introduce the gp css of @xmath0 group ( sometimes have been called klauder - perelomov css @xcite ) .",
    "these states @xcite are defined in the interior of the unit disk in the complex plane , centered at the origin .",
    "the nonlinearity function corresponding to these states is deduced as @xmath109 @xcite . in this subsection , we first take @xmath110 in our further numerical calculations .",
    "different quantities mentioned in section 4 associated to the atom - field state ( [ state vec sys ] ) , have been plotted versus time in figures 6 - 9 with fixed parameters @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "figure 6 deals with the mean photon number . a typical fractional collapses and revivals",
    "are visible from the figure 6a .",
    "this figure indicates that the envelope of the oscillations fractionally collapses to a fixed value @xmath114 and as time goes on , the collapsed mean photon number is partly revived .",
    "the maximum amplitude of the oscillations occurred at @xmath115 decreases with time , and the duration of the oscillations varies , irregularly . our aim for showing the figure in a short time interval is to explain the details of the variation of mean photon number in a more apparent fashion , particularly in relation to next figure .",
    "atomic population inversion is shown in figure 7 .",
    "the positivity of this quantity at all time means that the probability of the presence of the atom in the state @xmath18 is larger than the probability of being in the state @xmath63 .",
    "similar to mean photon number , fractional collapses and revivals are observable from figure 7a .",
    "it is to be noted that , in this case the atomic population inversion collapses to a fixed value @xmath116 .",
    "figures 6b and 7b are the same as figures 6a and 7a , respectively , with the same chosen parameters , except that the interval of time are restricted to @xmath117 . a comparison between the figures 6b and 7b shows that they both obey nearly the same general pattern and makes one sure that the variations of mean photon number and the atomic population inversion are in opposite directions , as is expected .",
    "figure 8 displays mandel parameter as a function of time .",
    "the supper - poissonian behaviour is observed from the figure , together with a ( typical ) collapses and revivals .",
    "this phenomenon occurs for the system under consideration , although not in a clear and regular manner .",
    "indeed , mandel parameter oscillates such drastically with time that the quasi - chaotic behaviour is revealed . in figure 9",
    "the curves of squeezing parameters @xmath118 and @xmath119 are shown for @xmath120 .",
    "only the negativity of @xmath118 , which indicates squeezing effect in @xmath103 quadrature , is revealed in a finite interval of time .    at this stage , in contrast to buzek @xcite and koroli _ et al _ @xcite that took @xmath121 and @xmath14 , we will set @xmath122 and follow our numerical calculations .",
    "the nonlinearity function @xmath123 can be associated with a particular case of the bg state when one chooses @xmath124 .",
    "these states are defined in the whole of the complex plane .",
    "we emphasize that as in the gp css , we consider the holestein - primakoff realization of @xmath11 lie algebra of bg states .",
    "barut - girardello ( bg ) css of @xmath0 group @xcite are established as the dual pair of gp css @xcite .",
    "the nonlinearity function of these states is obtained as @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "it is easy to check that the operators @xmath126 $ ] satisfy the commutation relations @xmath127 @xmath128=2k_{0,bg},$ ] @xmath129=\\pm k_{\\pm , bg}.$ ] where @xmath130 .",
    "anyway , choosing @xmath131 , our calculated results have been displayed in figures 10 - 13 .",
    "the mean photon number and atomic population inversion versus time for the corresponding atom - field states have been shown in figures 10 and 11 , respectively . in the range which the atomic population inversion gets negative values , the probability of the presence of the atom in @xmath63 is indeed more than @xmath18 . observing figures 10 and 11",
    ", it will be clear that , any increase ( decrease ) in population inversion is simultaneous with a decrease ( increase ) in mean photon number . also , there are two distinct oscillatory behaviour in these two quantities , one ( small ) is within the other ( large ) .",
    "this feature was not appeared in @xcite , when they took @xmath132 ( figures 1 and 2 of ref .",
    "while there are some jumps in the mean photon number ( which simultaneously accompanied by a sudden decrease in the atomic population inversion ) , according to our results small jumps and decrease within great jumps and decrease will be revealed .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , we continued our numerical results ( have not shown here ) with calculating the mean photon number and atomic population inversion in a wide interval of time and observed that , for both values of the considered @xmath133 , the quantities are nearly ( not exactly ) periodic .",
    "but , the period of time for the case @xmath113 is larger than the case @xmath134 . in figure 12",
    ", the mandel parameter has been displayed as a function of time .",
    "the results indicate that for @xmath134 this parameter is almost periodic , while its maximum amplitude decreases with time .",
    "the sub - poissonian behaviour also occurs in wide intervals of time . for large times",
    ", full sub - poissonian statistics will be revealed for such system , in both of the presented cases .",
    "it is worth noticing that , this non - classicality sign has not been observed in @xcite . in figure 13 , the curves of squeezing parameters repeated regularly , but not exactly . only for small intervals of time , squeezing effect is occurred in @xmath103 or @xmath104 quadrature . also a specific case can be regarded , i.e. , when @xmath135 , which means that the initial field is in the standard cs and the interaction between atom and field would be intensity - dependent .",
    "for instance , we consider @xmath136 .",
    "our numerical results have been displayed in figures 14 - 17 . in figure 14",
    "the mean photon number for the atom - field state ( [ state vec sys ] ) associated with these particular functions is shown .",
    "atomic population inversion is plotted versus time in figure 15 . a careful observation on the figures 14 , 15 leads one to conclude that , when the mean photon number of the field is increased ( decreased ) due to emission ( absorbtion ) , the probability of the presence of the atom to be in the @xmath63 ( @xmath137 ) state increases , consequently the atomic population inversion is reduced ( increased ) .",
    "figure 16 shows the mandel parameter , which implies that it is negative in a wide range of time , so that sub - poissonian behaviour occurs , repeatedly .",
    "as shown in figure 17 , in small regions of time the squeezing effect is observed weakly in @xmath103 or @xmath104 quadratures , separately .",
    "obviously , when @xmath138 is negative , @xmath139 have to be positive .",
    "summing up the above presented results , two remarkable points may be offered .",
    "firstly , the represented numerical results plotted in figures 2 - 5 for the case @xmath99 show that the collapses and revivals occur nearly regularly ( but not exactly ) relative to the next ones which contain some kind of nonlinearities .",
    "indeed , in the latter cases the chaotic behaviour will be revealed due to the presence of the nonlinearities . in general , the mandel parameter and squeezing effect have not an exact regular periodicity , specifically relative to two - level atoms .",
    "in addition , as it is expected , the variations of mean photon number and the atomic population inversion are in opposite directions .",
    "as we have explained , this is consistence with the physics of the considered interaction .",
    "also , the fractional collapses and revivals phenomenon , as a well - known non - classicality sign , is seen in the mean photon number , atomic population inversion and mandel parameter in the two groups of figures 6 - 8 .",
    "the negativity of mandel parameter in a wide range of time is observed in figures 12 and 16 .",
    "the latter effect , will become more important , if one recalls that the squeezing signature of the field is revealed only in a small finite interval of time ( see figures 9 , 13 , 17 ) .",
    "in summary , we have considered the interaction of an equidistant three - level atom in a cascade configuration with different dipole moment matrix transition elements between the adjacent atomic levels , and a single - mode cavity field that is initially prepared in a generalized cs .",
    "it should be emphasized that , our formalism is presented in a very general regime , because it contains two nonlinearity functions : @xmath9 which characterizes the initial state of the field and @xmath10 which determines the intensity - dependent coupling between atom and field .",
    "particularly , @xmath99 is equivalent to the case in which the initial state of the field is standard cs and the interaction between atom and field be independent of intensity .",
    "interestingly , we have presented a closed analytical solution for such a non - trivial problem .",
    "then , as some physical appearances of the proposed structure , we have investigated the mean photon number , atomic population inversion , mandel parameter and squeezing parameters for gp and bg css of @xmath0 group as well as some special cases .",
    "a few points are remarkable , regarding the presented results .",
    "* unlike the reported work by buzek in @xcite which considered the two - level atom , we have not observed the exact regular periodicity of the squeezing parameters , in neither of the chosen nonlinearity functions .",
    "we also calculated the mandel parameter and find that the exact periodicity which occurs in two - level atom violates .",
    "these phenomenon are consistence with the reported results in @xcite .",
    "we investigated and examined this observations for various cases , either with the same nonlinearities ( @xmath140 ) or with different nonlinearities ( @xmath132 ) . *",
    "the variation of mean photon number and atomic population inversion are in opposite directions , which is an expected result , in view of the physics of the systems under the considered interaction .",
    "also , for the special case @xmath141 in the second group of figures , the fractional collapses and revivals phenomenon in the mean photon number and the atomic population inversion , as well as the mandel parameter are new features of our proposal , may be highlighted .",
    "* our results confirm that only in the fully quantum theory of radiation , the spontaneous emission ( transition from the upper state to the lower one ) in the vacuum of the field becomes possible . * comparing the figures 2 - 5 ,",
    "represented the numerical results have been plotted for the case @xmath99 , with next figures one can see that the collapses and revivals occur more regularly for the former ones relative to others which contain some kind of nonlinearities , either in nonlinearity function of initial state or the intensity - dependent coupling . indeed , in the latter cases the chaotic behaviour will be revealed due to the presence of the nonlinearities . * apart from these , the generality and at the same time the simplicity of our proposal allows one to apply it to other physical systems with known nonlinearity functions , for instance , center of mass motion of trapped ion @xcite , photon - added css @xcite , @xmath142-css @xcite , deformed photon - added nonlinear coherent states @xcite have been recently introduced by one of us and so on .",
    "these are straightforward tasks may be done elsewhere . on the other side ,",
    "roknizadeh et al introduced a hamiltonian associated with a nonlinear oscillator system , based on action identity requirement of nonlinear css as follows : @xmath143 @xcite , upon which one obtains the eigenvalues @xmath144 or equivalently @xmath145 .",
    "so , obviously the presented approach can be easily applied to such one - dimensional solvable systems , too ."
