    "we consider the iterative solution of a linear system @xmath0 where @xmath1 is symmetric and positive definite ( spd ) .",
    "it is well - known that the convergence of krylov subspace methods for solving linear systems depend on the eigenvalue distribution of @xmath2 .",
    "recently , several studies @xcite have shown that by removing the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors corresponding to several small eigenvalues from the krylov search space makes the spectrum more clustered and consequently the convergence is improved . in this paper",
    ", we refer to matrix of the form @xmath3 as a projection matrix , and the subspace spanned by the columns of @xmath4 is referred to as a coarse space . in an ideal situation ,",
    "the coarse space contains the vectors corresponding to the lower part of the spectrum that is responsible for the stagnation of krylov subspace methods . as shown in this paper",
    ", the preconditioned systems will have the desired properties when the preconditioner is enchanced with the ideal coarse subspace .",
    "in contrast to the general coarse space , we refer to the coarse space spanned by the eigenvectors associated with several small eigenvalues of @xmath2 as the exact coarse space .",
    "next we briefly mention a few existing approaches that take the form of a standard precondition with an additive coarse space enchancement . in @xcite ,",
    "the deflation preconditioner is defined by @xmath5 obviously @xmath6 is singular since @xmath7 is singular .",
    "fortunately , krylov subspace methods converge for singular linear systems as long as they are consistent ; furthermore , zero eigenvalues do not impact the convergence since the corresponding eigenvectors never enter the krylov subspace @xcite . instead of zero out the small eigenspace in the deflation method",
    ", the preconditioners based on coarse correction shift the small eigenvalues to the large ones . in @xcite , the coarse correction preconditioner in domain decomposition method is defined by @xmath8 the abstract additive coarse correction is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the sum of the local solves in each subdomain .",
    "another popular preconditioner in domain decomposition method is the abstract balancing preconditioner @xcite @xmath11 the adapted deflation preconditioner @xcite is defined as @xmath12 it is shown in @xcite that @xmath13 is cheaper than @xmath14 but is as robust as @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , @xmath15 and @xmath16 have an identical spectrum . in both @xmath14 and @xmath13",
    ", the first term corresponds to the fine space and the second term is for the coarse space , therefore they are called two - level preconditioners . throughout this paper , we restrict our analysis to one - level methods .",
    "let @xmath10 in @xmath13 be @xmath17 .",
    "we define @xmath18 as @xmath19    let @xmath20 be any basis of a coarse space not @xmath4 .",
    "obviously the following identity @xmath21 holds in exact arithmetic since there exists a nonsingular matrix @xmath22 such that @xmath23 .",
    "this implies that @xmath7 , @xmath24 and @xmath18 are determined uniquely by the coarse space .",
    "thus we can choose an appropriate basis to form @xmath4 and then to construct a preconditioner with certain desirable properties .",
    "as we will see , if an approximate coarse space is used to construct preconditioners , then the spectrum of the preconditioned systems is related to the angle between the approximate and exact coarse spaces .",
    "we also prove that the coarse correction and adapted deflation preconditioners are more roust than the deflation preconditioner when the projection matrix is solved inexactly . in section 2 ,",
    "we first review the spectral properties of the preconditioned system when the preconditioners are constructed with the exact coarse space , then we estimate the spectral bounds of the preconditioned systems when the approximate coarse space is used .",
    "section 3 presents the perturbation analysis on the spectrum of the preconditioned system in the case that the projection matrix have some perturbation .",
    "numerical results are reported in section 4 .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the spectrum of the system preconditioned by using the exact coarse space , then based on these properties we derive the bounds of the spectrum of the system preconditioned by using the approximate coarse space .",
    "let @xmath25 be an eigenpair of @xmath2 and @xmath26 be normalized .",
    "@xmath27 is orthogonal since @xmath2 is spd .",
    "the spectral decomposition of @xmath2 can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "assume that @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 are small eigenvalues that impacts the convergence of the krylov subspace methods .",
    "theorem [ th : exact_coarse_space ] and theorem [ th : exactright ] show that if we take @xmath37 , the small eigenvalues are removed or shifted when the preconditioners are applied on either side of @xmath2 , moreover , the rest of eigenvalues and all the eigenvectors are not changed .",
    "[ th : exact_coarse_space ] let @xmath38 .",
    "define @xmath39 then we have the following spectral decomposition @xmath40    from the definition of @xmath41 , we have @xmath42 next , let us consider the first result . obviously , @xmath43 .",
    "we then have @xmath44 thus the first spectral decomposition holds . since @xmath45 we have @xmath46 and @xmath47 hence , the second spectral decomposition is true .",
    "the third spectral decomposition follows from @xmath48 and @xmath49 it follows immediately from these three spectral decomposition that @xmath6 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are symmetric .",
    "[ th : exactright ] @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are defined in theorem [ th : exact_coarse_space ] .",

    "the first result follows from @xmath58 and @xmath59 note that @xmath2 , @xmath53 and @xmath60 are symmetric .",
    "we then have @xmath61 since @xmath62 we get @xmath63 and @xmath64 the third result is therefore true .",
    "in addition , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are symmetric as well .    for a large system ,",
    "it is impractical to build the preconditioners by using the exact eigenvectors associated with the small eigenvalues , since in general computing these eigenvectors is more costly and more difficult than solving a linear system .",
    "nevertheless , for some cases , the approximate eigenvectors are cheaply obtained and thus are used to produce the preconditioners .",
    "for example , in the newton method for solving nonlinear problems , the information obtained during solving the first linear system is reused to build the coarse spaces for accelerating the convergence of the succeeding linear systems , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we hope that the system preconditioned by using the approximate coarse space has the similar eigenvalue distribution as described in theorem [ th : exact_coarse_space ] .",
