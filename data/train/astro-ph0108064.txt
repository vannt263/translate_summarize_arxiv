    "the theory of the ly@xmath0 forest based on gravitational collapse of a continuously fluctuating intergalactic medium ( igm ) has been used to account for the correlation in absorption along the line of sight to single quasars , and to infer from these observations the primordial power spectrum of density perturbations ( croft et al .  1999 , 2000 ;",

    "2000 ) . now",
    "the calculation should be extended to correlation across the line of sight , i.e. , correlation between absorption in spectra of quasars separated by small angles in the sky .",
    "comparison of theoretical predictions to a measurement of the full dependence of the correlation function of the transmitted flux on angle and separation will be a valuable test of the ly@xmath0 forest theory itself ; however , the ultimate purpose of this measurement is to constrain the cosmological geometry at @xmath12 through the alcock & paczyski ( 1979 ) test ( hereafter , ap test ) , as proposed by mcdonald & miralda - escud ( 1999 ) and hui , stebbins , & burles ( 1999 ) .",
    "the ap test is in turn sensitive to the presence of a cosmological constant , @xmath2 , or other kinds of vacuum energy .",
    "this paper addresses the need to understand the redshift - space anisotropy of the ly@xmath0 forest  correlation in order to perform an accurate measurement of cosmological parameters .",
    "we can move aggressively to use the ly@xmath0 forest  as a cosmological probe because a working theory for the formation of the forest has been developed in many papers over the last decade , using semi - analytic methods and numerical simulations ( e.g. , mcgill 1990 ; bi 1993 ; cen et al .",

    "i present computations of the three - dimensional power spectrum of the transmitted flux ( equivalent to the correlation function ) .",
    "the flux power on large scales is given by the usual redshift - space formula derived from the linear theory of gravitational collapse ( kaiser 1987 ) : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the redshift - space wavenumber , @xmath15 is the real - space , linear theory power at @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the projection of @xmath14 along the line of sight , @xmath19 is a `` bias '' parameter relating flux fluctuations to density fluctuations , and @xmath20 is a second parameter describing the redshift - space anisotropy .",
    "i compute the values of both of these parameters from the ly@xmath0 forest  theory using numerical simulations .",
    "[ usually , @xmath19 and @xmath20 have been discussed in the context of galaxy clustering , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the matter density ( in units of the critical density ) at redshift @xmath23 ; however , for the ly@xmath0 forest  @xmath20 is an independent parameter ( mcdonald et al .",
    "2000 ) . ] on small scales , where equation ( [ kaiseq ] ) is invalid because of non - linear effects , i extract the power spectrum from the simulations directly .",
    "a direct computation of the bias parameters is unprecedented .",
    "while @xmath19 and @xmath20 set the amplitude of the large - scale ( i.e. , linear ) power , their values are in fact determined by the small - scale structure of the field in question ( i.e. , transmitted flux or galaxy density ) , so the problem of computing their values from first principles is generally non - linear ( see dekel & lahav 1998 ) . in the case of the galaxy density ,",
    "a complete calculation is hopeless , because of the importance of star formation to galaxy formation , although some understanding of the physical nature and evolution of galaxy bias has been achieved by combining numerical simulations with semi - analytic prescriptions for star formation ( e.g. , blanton et al . 2000 ; benson et al .",
    "2000 ; cen & ostriker 2000 ; somerville et al .",
    "however , the lya forest is much simpler according to the picture developed in the papers listed previously .",
    "we can simulate the small - scale structure in most of the volume of the igm , essentially from first principles , and thus compute model predictions for any observable statistic of the ly@xmath0 forest   transmitted flux , including the large - scale bias !",
    "the observational motivation for this work is the impending flood of quasar spectra that will need to be analyzed in the near future [ e.g. , from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ; york et al .",
    "if their full potential for measuring @xmath2 through the ap test ( and also for measuring other parameters through the measurement of the small - scale power spectrum ) is to be exploited , the accuracy of our model predictions must exceed the level currently used for one - dimensional work ( e.g. , croft et al .  2000 ;",
    "zaldarriaga , hui , & tegmark 2000 ) . here",
    "i take some first steps toward an accurate analysis of large data sets that include close pairs and groups of spectra .",
    "i examine some of the modeling uncertainties that have been under - studied in recent work focussed on interpreting one - dimensional data , including the effect of pressure in the simulations , the resolution and box size of the simulations , and the detailed dependence of the power spectrum on model parameters .",
    "i attempt to present the results in a form that will encourage comparison with other model predictions , and shed some light on the issues that need to be considered when planning the massive numerical studies that are inevitably needed before the results of a precision ap measurement can be believed ( this paper can be thought of as a pilot study ) .",
    "although i focus on the three - dimensional correlation needed to accomplish the ap test , many of the issues discussed are also relevant to the estimation of the mass power spectrum from one - dimensional data . finally , i use the computed power spectrum to estimate the potential of the ap test to constrain @xmath2 and the requirements on signal - to - noise ( s / n ) and resolution of the data , more realistically than previously possible .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in  2 i review the basics of the ap test . in",
    "3 i describe and test my procedure for computing the power spectrum from simulations given a single set of model parameters . in  4",
    "i describe the changes in the predicted power when each of the model parameters is varied . in  5",
    "i discuss the ap test using my new power spectrum calculations .",
    "the reader who is interested first in cosmology , but not the details of the ly@xmath0 forest  power spectrum , may want to read sections 35 in reverse order .",
    "the function of redshift that relates angular separation ( @xmath24 ) on the sky to hubble flow velocity separation perpendicular to the line of sight ( @xmath25 ) can be measured from the correlation function of any observable field by requiring that the correlation be isotropic in real space . at high redshift",
    "this measurement is sensitive to the cosmological constant ( alcock & paczyski 1979 ) .",
    "one advantage of this method is the fact that no assumption of standard candles or rods is required , and it is therefore independent of evolutionary effects of observed `` objects '' .",
    "the total velocity separation between two points along the line of sight is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the redshift separation , @xmath28 is the hubble flow velocity and @xmath29 is the peculiar velocity .",
    "the perpendicular velocity separation is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the hubble constant at @xmath23 , and @xmath33 is the usual angular diameter distance . with the assumption of isotropy , the real space two - point correlation function of fluctuations , @xmath34 , must be a function of @xmath35 only .",
    "if @xmath36 could be measured , it would be a relatively straightforward matter to measure @xmath37 by simply demanding isotropy .",
    "however , generally the large - scale correlations in the universe are induced by gravitational collapse , and the peculiar velocities make the correlation function in redshift space anisotropic ( kaiser 1987 ) .",
    "the peculiar velocities introduce an anisotropy in the observable ( redshift space ) correlation function , @xmath38 , of the same order as the difference in @xmath37 between various cosmological models . in mcdonald and miralda - escud ( 1999 )",
    "( see also hui , stebbins , & burles 1999 ) we showed that it is possible to disentangle the effects of geometry and peculiar velocities and recover the desired global parameters from the correlations in the ly@xmath0 forest absorption .",
    "i now show the sensitivity of @xmath37 to cosmological parameters , assuming a model containing pressureless matter with density @xmath39 , and a second component with negative pressure , @xmath40 , and energy density @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the critical density . for simplicity ,",

    ", we see that the sensitivity of @xmath56 to @xmath2 peaks just beyond @xmath57 , and is fairly constant with increasing redshift .    in  5",
    "i show that the effective central redshift for the ly@xmath0 forest  ap test using sdss data will be @xmath58 , so i look more carefully at the sensitivity to parameters of @xmath37 at this redshift .",
    "figure [ ommomlfcont ] shows contours of constant @xmath59 in the @xmath55@xmath2 plane , assuming @xmath60 .    for a typical model with @xmath61 and @xmath62 ,",
    "the contours are perpendicular to the line that indicates flatness .",
    "this means that a measurement of @xmath56 complements the cmb anisotropy measurements , which constrain @xmath63 , and will be a cross - check on the type ia supernova measurements , which have contours similar to the ly@xmath0 forest  test ( recent cmb and snia constraints are combined in de bernardis et al .",

    "2000 ) . assuming the universe is flat , figure [ ommwfcont ] shows contours of constant @xmath56 in the @xmath55@xmath43 plane .",
    "the remarkable insensitivity of the ly@xmath0 forest  ap test to @xmath43 in models with @xmath64 is actually a positive aspect of the test , because many of the other future tests ( e.g. , improved cmb , snia , and galaxy number counts ) have roughly diagonal degeneracy contours in the @xmath55@xmath43 plane ( huterer & turner 2000 ) .    aside from measuring cosmological parameters ,",
    "simply measuring @xmath37 at high redshift would test the correctness of currently studied friedmann - robertson - walker cosmological models in a qualitatively new regime .",
    "the purpose of this section is to establish how i compute the three - dimensional flux power spectrum , @xmath3 , for a given set of model parameters , and to explore some of the potential numerical and modeling uncertainties . in ",
    "3.1 i describe the simulations that i use , in  3.2",
    "i investigate the effect of pressure in the simulations , in  3.3 i test the effects of simulation resolution and box size , in  3.4 i introduce a method for extending the simulation predictions to scales larger than the box size by computing the linear theory bias parameters for the ly@xmath0 forest , and in  3.5 i introduce a simple analytic fitting formula that conveniently describes the power for all @xmath14 .",
    "when i discuss the modeling uncertainties , i will generally define better than 10% accuracy in the ratio of the power along to the power across the line of sight to be a `` good '' result .",
    "the anisotropy of the power is the most relevant quantity for the ap test . in",
    "5 i show that 10% accuracy is more than sufficient to interpret existing data , and data that will exist in the very near future , and is approaching the accuracy needed for comparison with the full quasar sample of the sdss .",
    "furthermore , the approximations made in the hydro - pm simulations that i use ( described below ) are only accurate to @xmath65% , so this represents a lower limit on the achievable accuracy .",
    "achieving better accuracy should be a straightforward matter of extending the type of study i present in this paper to include larger and fully hydrodynamic simulations .    for the reasons discussed in hui et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , i compute the power in the fluctuations of @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the mean transmitted flux , and @xmath68 is the redshift - space coordinate ( i.e. , the component of @xmath68 along the line of sight is @xmath69 , while the components transverse to the line of sight are described by @xmath70 and an azimuthal angle ) .",
    "i use the normalization convention @xmath71 so the flux correlation function is @xmath72 for convenience , i sometimes plot the quantity @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",

    "i discuss my procedure for computing the flux power spectrum , which breaks neatly into two parts : first , simulations using a given set of cosmological parameters ( e.g. , @xmath92 ) and a given thermal history ( temperature - density relation at all times ) are evolved to give the baryon density and velocity fields , which are output at desired redshifts . later , using these outputs , simulated spectra can be created for different choices of the parameters of the ly@xmath0 forestmodel ( the temperature - density relation at the output time , and the normalization of the optical depth ) .",
    "for the purpose of this paper , the freedom to run many simulations quickly is more important than having the most realistic simulations possible .",
    "the ly@xmath0 forest  is modeled using the hydro - pm ( hpm ) approximation to evolve the baryon density and velocity fields , using the same code described in gnedin & hui ( 1998 ) .",
    "one set of particles is used to represent both the baryons and dark matter . a pseudo - pressure term , based on an assumed temperature - density relation ( equation [ tdreq ] below ) ,",
    "is added to the usual newtonian force law as follows : @xmath93 with @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the particle velocity , @xmath96 is the gravitational potential , and @xmath97 is the pressure .",
    "to compute the pressure term , the hpm cod assumes a power - law temperature - density relation , @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the density in units of the mean density .",
    "this form arises naturally for gas expanding adiabatically in ionization equilibrium with a background radiation field , where the temperature is set by photoionization heating and adiabatic cooling ( hui & gnedin 1997 ) .",
    "fully hydrodynamic simulations confirm that equation ( [ tdreq ] ) provides a reasonable approximate description of the temperature - density relation for @xmath100 , above which shock heating leads to substantial dispersion in the temperatures at fixed densities ( croft et al .",
    "1997 ; theuns et al . 1998 ) .",
    "since most ly@xmath0 forest  absorption is by gas with @xmath101 , it is not too surprising that the hpm simulation method can give good agreement with the results of fully hydrodynamic simulations ( gnedin & hui 1998 ) . in practice ,",
    "i usually use the parameter @xmath102 in place of @xmath103 , because mcdonald et al .",
    "( 2001 ) measured the temperature most precisely at @xmath104 .",
    "for the purpose of computing this pressure term only , the parameters of the temperature - density relation in my simulations are set to the measured values from mcdonald et al .",

    "i interpolate linearly between the given redshifts .",
    "as i discuss further below , within the bounds allowed by the current observational measurements of the temperature - density relation , the detailed thermal history used to evolve the simulation is not important to our power spectrum results , at the level of accuracy that we are interested in this paper .",
    "for this reason , when i vary the temperature - density relation used to compute the recombination coefficient and thermal broadening when creating spectra ( see  3.1.2 ) , i do not need to re - run the simulations with a different thermal history .",
    "the mesh cells in my simulations are always equal in size to the spacing between particles .",
    "interpolation from the particles to the mesh is performed using triangular - shaped clouds ( hereafter tsc ; hockney & eastwood 1988 ) .",
    "i will refer to the length of the box along an axis as @xmath111 , and the number of particles as @xmath112 .",
    "after the evolution of a simulation is completed , i create simulated spectra from which i measure the power spectrum .",
    "entire simulation boxes are converted into spectra by using each grid cell in a face of the box as the origin for a line of sight through the simulation cube , i.e. , a spectral pixel is generated for every cell in the box ( in practice , i under - sample the transverse directions by factors of 2 because this saves computer time and does not introduce any noticeable error ) .",
    "the power spectrum is then obtained by a three - dimensional fft .",
    "the first step in creating spectra is to convert the hpm particle positions and velocities into density and velocity fields on a grid .",
    "this is done using the same tsc interpolation and grid spacing that was used in the evolution of the simulation .",
    "next , the baryon density is converted to density , @xmath113 , by assuming the gas is in ionization equilibrium with a uniform ionizing background , i.e. , @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the ionization rate , and @xmath116 is the temperature of the gas [ i use @xmath117 for the recombination coefficient ] .",

    "the primary difference between the hpm and full - hydro techniques is the latter include a full calculation of the temperature evolution of every element of gas and they include shocks .",
    "the most important practical consequence of this difference is probably the more realistic values for the temperatures used to compute the recombination coefficient and thermal broadening for the gas .",

    "this increase , which occurs at @xmath89 values where the power is already strongly suppressed by non - linear peculiar velocities , is probably the result of suppression of small - scale power in the velocity field . of course , the change in @xmath3 caused by pressure differences for reasonable changes in the temperature near the measured value ( see mcdonald et al .",

    "that is , if the difference in power between pm and hpm is only 10% , it seems unlikely that any inaccuracy in the hpm pressure relative to full - hydro will be significant ( recall that @xmath171% accuracy in the ratio of power along to across the line of sight is roughly the level i am aiming for in this paper ) . the main outstanding difference between a full - hydro and an hpm simulation is the scatter in temperature at a single density , especially at high densities",

    "note also that zaldarriaga et al .",
    "( 2000 ) allowed @xmath175 to be as high as @xmath176  clearly much too high to give even a rough representation of pressure for a reasonable thermal history of the gas .",
    "to make accurate power spectrum predictions , it is necessary to be sure we sufficiently resolve the ly@xmath0 forest  structure . as we saw in the case of pressure ,",
    "resolving small - scale structure is not only required to correctly predict the small - scale power , but also to predict the large - scale power ( i.e. , recall the factor of 1.1 increase , caused by pressure , in the large - scale power across the line of sight in figure [ preseff ] ) .",
    "this is analogous to the need to correctly simulate the formation of individual galaxies before galaxy bias can be predicted .",

    "the @xmath181 and @xmath182 simulations agree very well [ better than 5% for @xmath183 but the @xmath184 box shows larger disagreement .",

    "i test this conclusion further in figure [ restest](b ) , where i use an 8.89 @xmath179 box .",
    "the results are similar , but we see that decreasing the resolution quickly becomes quite harmful .",
    "these results are not improved if i compare simulations at fixed optical depth normalization ( @xmath135 ) instead of fixed @xmath67 .",
    "in addition to obviously limiting the scale on which predictions can be made , the limited size of the simulation boxes can also influence the power spectrum results on all scales , because of the non - linear coupling of modes during gravitational evolution . in figure [ boxsize ]",
    "i compare 80 , 40 , and 20 @xmath179 boxes , with @xmath186 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 particles , respectively ( it is not convenient to plot ratios because the @xmath89-modes are not identically spaced for different sized boxes ) .",

    "furthermore , in contrast to the case of galaxies , the non - linear transformation applied to the ly@xmath0 forest  field after the transformation into redshift space [ i.e. , @xmath219 means that for the ly@xmath0 forest  the relationship between the large - scale flux fluctuations and the gradient of peculiar velocity along the line of sight , smoothed on the same scale , must be determined separately from the @xmath220 relation .",

    "two bias parameters are needed : one , which i will call @xmath225 , that relates large - scale mass density fluctuations to transmitted flux fluctuations , and one , @xmath226 , that relates fluctuations in the gradient of the peculiar velocity field along the line of sight to flux fluctuations .",

    "given that the simultaneous requirements on box size and resolution already overburden my computing capabilities , i use a novel technique to compute the derivatives .",
    "i take advantage of the fact that small - scale structure in a sufficiently large , spherical , over - dense or under - dense region evolves identically to structure in a whole universe with the same density .",
    "i can therefore use my numerical simulations to simulate the evolution of structure in a large - scale perturbation by simply modifying the cosmological parameters that are input so they represent the perturbation instead of the background universe . using this trick ,",

    "this is not strictly true , but it greatly simplifies the calculations . in order to check this assumption , it is necessary to run simulations with anisotropic expansion .",
    "varying @xmath217 for a simulation cube still requires re - running the simulation , to correctly account for the dynamical effect of changes in the mean density on the growth of small scale structure . in practice",
    "this means that , using the same set of initial particle positions and velocities , i evolve the simulation forward to expansion factor @xmath236 , where @xmath162 is the original expansion factor , and use matter density parameter @xmath237 , where originally @xmath238 ( i correctly account for the presence of the cosmological constant and deviation of @xmath55 from 1 , but this is irrelevant in practice at @xmath239 ) . @xmath218 is simply the mean flux averaged over the entire modified box .",
    "the value of @xmath218 changes relative to the original simulation , not only because of the change in overall mean baryon density , but also because of the change in the small - scale distributions of densities and peculiar velocities .",
    "since i am ignoring the possibility that the anisotropic expansion of a large - scale region is important to the growth of small - scale structure within it , varying @xmath224 ( at fixed @xmath217 ) within a simulation cube , for the purpose of constructing ly@xmath0 forest  spectra , is basically trivial .",

    "i have investigated the importance of pressure , resolution , and box size in the simulations .",
    "figure [ preseff ] shows that the pressure force in the hpm simulations has an effect no larger than @xmath171% on the large - scale power ( relative to no pressure at all ) , but as much as @xmath392% on small scales .",
    "however , within the hpm approximation , the change in pressure corresponding to a @xmath393 k change in temperature results in @xmath394% change in power at all relevant @xmath89 , so it is not important to know the detailed thermal history of the gas in order to compute the pressure .",
    "figure [ restest](a , b ) shows that the required resolution for convergence of the power ( to @xmath11% ) on all relevant scales is @xmath395 , while @xmath396 gives good results for @xmath397 only , and @xmath398 gives poor results on all scales .",

    "future simulation work will be focused on determining the accuracy of the hpm approximations , and running larger simulations .",
    "one of the primary reasons to measure the correlation between the ly@xmath0 forest  absorption in multiple lines of sight is to determine the cosmological geometry through the alcock & paczyski ( 1979 ) test ( mcdonald & miralda - escud 1999 ; hui , stebbins , & burles 1999 ) , which i show can break the degeneracy between matter and vacuum energy in a flat universe ( see figure [ ommomlfcont ] ) , in a way that is _ independent of the equation of state of the vacuum energy _",

    "the results in this paper should have a wide variety of applications .",
    "for example , the power spectrum calculations should be sufficiently accurate for comparison with a data set consisting of all the currently known pairs ( to be safe , @xmath3 in this paper should not be trusted if better than 20% accuracy is important , although it may be more accurate than this ) .",
    "they will also be useful for planning future observing programs .",
    "the power of the ly@xmath0 forest  ap test in combination with other measurements of cosmological parameters can be investigated .",

    "the computed bias parameters relating large - scale fluctuations in the ly@xmath0 forest  to fluctuations in the mass can be used to interpret correlations between the ly@xmath0 forest  and other observables , such as lyman - break galaxies .",
