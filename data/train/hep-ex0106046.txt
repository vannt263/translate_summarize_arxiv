    "the fermilab experiment 687 collaboration has collected a large sample of high - energy photoproduction events , recorded with the e687 spectrometer @xcite@xcite during the 1990/91 fixed - target runs at the wideband photon beamline at fermilab .",
    "although the experiment is focussed on charm physics , a very large sample of diffractively photoproduced light - meson events was also recorded .",
    "this paper reports on a study@xcite of the diffractive photoproduction of the @xmath4 final state and the observation of a narrow dip in the mass spectrum at 1.9  gev / c@xmath0 .",
    "preliminary results on diffractive photoproduction of @xmath2 final states are also shown .",
    "in e687 , a forward multiparticle spectrometer is used to measure the interactions of high - energy photons on a 4-cm - thick be target .",
    "it is a large - aperture , fixed - target spectrometer with excellent vertexing , particle identification , and reconstruction capabilities for photons and @xmath5 s .",
    "the photon beam is derived from the bremsstrahlung of secondary electrons of @xmath6 gev endpoint energy , which were produced by the 800 gev/@xmath7 tevatron proton beam .",
    "the charged particles emerging from the target are tracked by a system of twelve planes of silicon microstrip detectors arranged in three views .",
    "these provide high - resolution separation of primary ( production ) and secondary ( charm decay or interaction ) vertices .",
    "the momentum of a charged particle is determined by measuring its deflections in two analysis magnets of opposite polarity with five stations of multiwire proportional chambers .",
    "three multicell threshold erenkov counters are used to discriminate between pions , kaons , and protons .",
    "photons and neutral pions are reconstructed by electromagnetic ( em ) calorimetry .",
    "hadron calorimetry and muon detectors provide triggering and additional particle identification .",
    "invariant mass after applying a cut on the total energy deposited in the calorimeters with respect to the total energy in the spectrometer.,width=288,height=288 ]    pions are produced in photon interactions in the be target .",
    "the data acquisition trigger requires a minimum energy deposition in the hadron calorimeters located behind the electromagnetic calorimeters and at least three charged tracks outside the pair region .",
    "the microstrip system and the forward spectrometer measure the six - pion final state ( in this paper,6@xmath8 refers to the @xmath9 state ) with a mass resolution @xmath10 at a total invariant mass of about 2  gev / c@xmath0 .",
    "it is required that a single six - prong vertex be reconstructed in the target region by the microstrip detector , with a good confidence level .",
    "such a requirement rejects background due to secondary interactions in the target .",
    "exclusive final states are selected by also requiring that the same number of tracks be reconstructed in the magnetic spectrometer .",
    "the six microstrip tracks and the six spectrometer tracks are required to be linked , with no ambiguity in associating the microstrip and spectrometer tracks .",
    "events with particles identified by the erenkov system as definite electrons , kaons , or protons , or as kaon / proton ambiguous are eliminated and at least four out of six particles have to be positively identified as @xmath11 .",
    "particle identification is tested by assuming that one or two out of the six tracks is a @xmath12 , by computing all two - track invariant mass combinations , and verifying that there is no evidence of a peak at the @xmath13 or at the @xmath14 mass .",
    "we eliminated final states with @xmath5 s by rejecting events with visible energy in the electromagnetic calorimeters that was not associated with the charged tracks .",
    "a cut in this variable ( @xmath15 ) is applied on the calorimetric neutral energy normalized to the six - pion energy measured in the spectrometer .",
    "the distribution of the six - pion invariant mass after these cuts is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the plot shows a structure at 1.9  gev / c@xmath0 . in the following",
    ", only the 6@xmath8 mass region around this structure will be analyzed .    for diffractive reactions at our energies ,",
    "the square of the four - momentum transfer @xmath16 can be approximated by the square of the total transverse momentum @xmath17 of the diffractively produced hadronic final state . using this definition , the @xmath17 distribution of diffractive events , fig .",
    "2 , is well described by two exponentials : a coherent contribution with a slope b@xmath18(gev",
    "/ c)@xmath19 consistent with the be form factor @xcite and an incoherent contribution with a slope b@xmath20(gev",
    "/ c)@xmath19 .",
    "taking only events with @xmath21gev@xmath22 , we evaluated a contamination of about @xmath23 from nondiffractive events .",
    "this incoherent contribution shows no structure in the 1.2@xmath243.0   gev / c@xmath0 mass range , fig .",
    "the diffractive mass distribution was obtained by subtracting this contribution , parametrized by a polynomial fit , and dividing the yield by the detection efficiency .",
    "the detection efficiency was computed by modeling diffractive photoproduction of a mass m , using the experimentally found slope b@xmath25 , and simulating the decay m@xmath26 according to phase space @xcite .",
    "there is no threshold or discontinuity for the efficiency , particularly in the region of the dip structure . at @xmath27 , the ( self - normalized relative ) efficiency _ a _ varied as _ da / a / dm_@xmath28 = 0.15/@xmath29 .",
    "the efficiency and the efficiency - corrected distribution of the six - pion invariant mass for diffractive events , in the mass range 1.4@xmath30 , are shown in fig .",
    "there no evidence , albeit with large combinatorial backgrounds , for resonance substructure , e.g. , @xmath31 , in the 6@xmath8 data below @xmath32 , either at the mass region of the dip or in nearby sidebands .",
    "similarly , the efficiency or acceptance exhibited no threshold , edge , or discontinuity over the entire mass region observed , when the six pion state was simulated as a sequence of decays of intermediate two - body resonances , for example @xmath33 , even under extreme assumptions of full longitudinal or transverse polarizations for the initial state .",
    "the presence of a dip at 1.9  gev / c@xmath0 was verified by several systematics checks .",
    "diffractive photoproduction of pairs or the associated production of 0bar plus a charm baryon at low t ( where the decay products of the other charm meson or charm baryon are missed ) followed by the 6 @xmath8 decay of the d@xmath34 or 0bar are estimated by monte carlo simulation to be negligible contributions .",
    "it was also checked that demanding more stringent cuts ( i.e. , requiring that all six particles be identified as @xmath11 , applying a sharper cut on the calorimeter neutral energy , or subtracting the incoherent contribution bin by bin ) increases the statistical errors without significantly affecting the behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : third ] .",
    "a three - parameter polynomial fit was performed , solid line in fig.4 , to explore the hypothesis that any structure in this distribution is a statistical fluctuation .",
    "the normalized residual distribution , evaluated for each 10-mev / c@xmath0 bin , is good in the full invariant mass range , with the exception of the interval centered at 1.9  gev / c@xmath0 , the region of the claimed dip , where a poor @xmath35 confidence level interval , is obtained , making it highly unlikely that the observed dip is a statistical fluctuation .",
    "incoherently adding a breit - wigner to the fit does not improve the fit quality much .",
