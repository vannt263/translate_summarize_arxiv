    "our models including the evolution of single and binary stars have been discussed in an accompanying contribution in this volume ( mas - hesse and cervio , `` evolutionary population synthesis : the effect of binary systems '' ) . here",
    "we present the predictions corresponding to the multiwavelength sed and the he and h emission lines .",
    "the main contribution of this work is the inclusion of the x - ray domain in the multiwavelength energy distribution of evolutionary synthesis models .",
    "the basic components of the x - ray emission included in the code are :    * _ mechanical energy _ released by sn and stellar winds in the ism , which is partially reprocessed to thermal soft x - rays . * _ supernovae remnants _",
    ", which have been assumed to generate two components with a composed raymond - smith spectrum .",
    "* _ high mass x - ray binaries _ , with circular orbits ( i.e. giant or supergiant stars ) and stellar wind accretion onto a compact object , producing hard black body emission .",
    "we show in fig .  1 the predicted sed for 2 ages , assuming an instantaneous burst .",
    "a very young cluster ( 0.25  myr ) shows thermal radio emission , some thermal soft x - rays contribution from the hot , diffuse interstellar gas and almost no emission at hard x - rays . at 16  myr ,",
    "however , the radio emission has become non - thermal and is dominated by supernova remnants .",
    "supernova remnants also contribute to the soft x - ray emission , and a strong hard x - ray component associated to high - mass - x - ray binaries appears .",
    "the far infrared emission in the iras band is due to dust reprocessing thermally the absorbed uv photons .",
    "the effect of binary evolution on the h emission lines is shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen that the ionizing flux ( and therefore @xmath0 as well ) decreases much slower than in a single - star - only cluster , due to the formation of hot wr and ob stars by mass transfer at ages above 5  myr . on the other hand , the additional ionizing photons produced by binary systems and by the hot interstellar gas increase significantly the @xmath1  @xmath2 ratio ( by more than a factor 10 at ages larger than 5 myrs ( see fig .",
    "2b ) ) . assuming a high efficiency in the reprocessing of mechanical energy into soft x - rays ( top line in fig .",
    "2b ) , it is possible to reproduce the observational values of this ratio , which shows an average around @xmath3 . we conclude that this additional component of the ionizing flux might be ( partially ) responsible of the relatively large @xmath4 values observed in several starburst galaxies ."
