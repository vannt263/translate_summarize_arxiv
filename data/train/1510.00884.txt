    "a monochromatic wave impinging on a static disordered sample is scrambled to produce a stable speckled intensity pattern within and beyond the sample .",
    "this pattern is the result of the interference of waves following innumerable possible trajectories leading to any point and is not statistically correlated with the incident waveform .",
    "nonetheless , if the transmission matrix ( tm ) _ t _ is known , it is possible to exert a measure of control over the output waveform by manipulating the incident field @xcite .",
    "the elements of the tm are the field transmission coefficients @xmath0 between incident and outgoing channels of the empty waveguide , _ a _ and _ b _ , respectively .",
    "the number of such channels in samples of constant cross section and reflecting sides is essentially the ratio of the cross sectional area @xmath1 and the square of the field coherence length , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the wavelength in the medium surrounding the sample . by adjusting the phase of the incident channels so that all the transmitted channels are in phase at a selected point",
    ", a focused spot can be produced at that point with peak intensity @xmath4 times larger than the average intensity before focusing @xcite .",
    "the _ n _ transmission eigenchannels are paired sets of orthogonal incident and outgoing field patterns with associated transmission eigenvalues @xmath5 ranked from @xmath6 to _ n _ in order of decreasing transmission . as a result of the repulsion between the eigenvalues of the transmission matrix",
    ", they span the range from unity , @xmath7 , to @xmath8 @xcite , where @xmath9 is the sample length and @xmath10 is the transport mean free path in which the direction of a wave is randomized .",
    "the exponentially large dynamic range of transmission eigenvalues allows for the control of net transmission through the sample @xcite . however , there are practical limitations on the dynamic range of transmission because the complete transmission matrix of a sample can not be easily determined @xcite",
    ".    the wide range of transmission eigenvalues was discovered by dorokhov @xcite who considered the scaling of the conductance of wires . in units of the quantum of conductance , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the electron charge and @xmath13 is planck s constant , the conductance is equal to the transmittance , @xmath14 , which is the sum of all flux transmission coefficients between channels , and",
    "can be expressed as the sum of all transmission eigenvalues , @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "dorokhov @xcite found that a multichannel medium scales as a collection of @xmath4 independent eigenchannels , each with its own auxiliary localization length , @xmath16 .",
    "the variation of @xmath5 with @xmath9 is given by @xmath17 .",
    "the inverse auxiliary localization lengths increase linearly with @xmath18 as @xmath19 for @xmath20 and somewhat faster for @xmath21 @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath22 is the localization length . for diffusive samples with @xmath23 ,",
    "transmission is higher than @xmath24 for approximately @xmath25 eigenchannels @xcite , of which the auxiliary localization lengths are greater than @xmath9 .",
    "here , @xmath26 indicates the average over an ensemble of random sample configurations .",
    "the transmission eigenchannels are the @xmath4 pairs of incident and outgoing waveforms @xmath27 and @xmath28 corresponding to the @xmath18th column of the complex unitary matrices @xmath29 and @xmath30 found in the singular value decomposition of the tm , @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 is a diagonal matrix with elements @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "since transmission eigenchannels are found from an analysis of the transmission matrix at a particular frequency , the focus of the studies of the tm has been on the transmission and control of monochromatic waves @xcite .",
    "there has also been interest in focusing in space and time by bringing all components of the transmitted field into phase at a particular point in space and time @xcite .",
    "generally , studies of pulse transmission and focusing have dealt with incident waves with a fixed incoming spatial waveform over the pulse bandwidth . for a short pulse with broad bandwidth ,",
    "the ensemble average of the time of flight distribution is the fourier transform of the field correlation function @xcite . for diffusive sample , the time of flight distribution of transmitted radiation is given by solving the diffusion equation describing the incoherent walk of photons",
    ". this could no longer be the case when the incident wave corresponds to a transmission eigenchannels since the properties of the eigenchannels reflects the coherence of the wave .",
    "in addition , the time and flight distribution and the field correlation function would no longer be a fourier transform pair . at present , neither the transmitted pulse profile nor the field or intensity correlation functions for specific transmission eigenchannels is known . until now , interest in the dynamics of particular transmission eigenchannels has been limited to the dwell time of the wave through the medium at a particular frequency @xcite . however , the dynamics of transmission eigenchannels are of great potential interest since transmission eigenchannels are orthogonal sets of waveforms on the sample s incident and outgoing surfaces that may be determined experimentally .",
    "transmission eigenchannels may thereby provide a basis for controlling the dynamic and spectral properties of transmission @xcite .",
    "because the incident waveforms @xmath27 change with frequency , pulsed transmission has generally been analyzed in terms of the quasi - normal modes of the medium with volume speckle patterns that are independent of frequency .",
    "such quasi - normal modes are resonances of the open medium @xcite , which we shall refer to as  modes \" for simplicity .",
    "these are solutions of the wave equation and are analogous to levels in electronic systems .",
    "a possible approach to the description of the dynamics of transmission eigenchannels is to find the way they are composed of modes @xcite .",
    "this is clear with regard to the first transmission eigenchannel in transmission on resonance with spectrally isolated modes of localized waves .",
    "the speckle patterns of the first transmission eigenchannel and the resonant mode at the output surface of the sample are nearly identical @xcite .",
    "however , for both diffusive and localized waves , the way low transmission eigenchannels may be formed from the modes of the medium has not been clarified .",
    "in addition to enabling the control of pulsed transmission , the understanding of the modal makeup of transmission eigenchannels can also be exploited to control the excitation of modes within the sample .",
    "this would be of importance in applications such as low - threshold random lasing , which require deposition of energy in long - lived modes deep within the bulk of the medium @xcite .",
    "relating transmission eigenvalues and modes in random media is also of fundamental interest .",
    "the close connection between these excitations is manifest in the equality for diffusive waves of two localization parameters , the dimensionless conductance _",
    "g _ and the thouless number @xmath34 @xcite , which is the ratio of the average spectral width and spacing of modes .    in this paper , we show that , in addition to differences in the magnitude of steady - state transmission , transmission eigenchannels have distinctive temporal and spectral properties .",
    "low - transmission eigenchannels respond promptly to an incident pulse and their eigenvalues are correlated over a wide frequency range .",
    "we show how both dynamic and steady - state characteristics of transmission eigenchannels emerge from the way eigenchannels are made up of modes .",
    "lower transmission eigenchannels are composed of a larger number of modes that are further from resonance and are consequently more strongly suppressed by destructive interference .",
    "this is conveniently formulated by expressing the tm as a superposition of modal tms .",
    "we demonstrate in microwave experiments that the representation of channels in terms of modes makes it possible to excite specific modes of the medium .",
    "this can be exploited for controlling energy deposition within the medium and selectively exciting long - lived modes .",
    "we consider the static and dynamic properties of transmission eigenchannels in disordered quasi - one dimensional waveguides , which are locally two dimensional , by analyzing simulations of the tm at each frequency over a range of frequencies .",
    "simulations are carried out in the crossover to localization in an ensemble of samples with @xmath35 , in which a number of transmission eigenchannels and modes typically contribute to transmission .",
    "though there is appreciable spectral overlap of transmission peaks and of modes for this ensemble , it is still possible to analyze field transmission spectra into a superposition of the modes of the medium @xcite .",
    "it is thereby possible to obtain their central frequencies , linewidths , and speckle patterns in transmission .",
    "this makes it possible to probe the modal basis of the steady - state and dynamic properties of transmission eigenchannels .",
    "because the key to understanding the dynamics of transmission eigenchannels lies in the behavior of low - transmission eigenchannels , which are buried in the noise in experiments in random ensembles with @xmath36 , simulations rather than measurements are utilized for the most part in this study .",
    "in contrast , experimental studies of the control energy within the medium for high transmission eigenchannels are not limited by measurement noise and such control is demonstrated in section iii.c in microwave measurements of transmission in random dielectric waveguides for which @xmath37 .    the wave equation , @xmath38 , is discretized on a square grid and solved using the recursive green s function method @xcite .",
    "the random position - dependent dielectric constant , @xmath39 varies on the grid with @xmath40 drawn from the rectangular distribution [ -0.9,0.9 ] .",
    "thus , the index of refraction of the empty waveguide before and after the random sample of unity and the averaged index of refraction of the random portion of the waveguide are matched and internal reflection is minimal . the wavelength of the incident wave in the leads is set to be @xmath41 in units of the grid spacing at 10 ghz .",
    "the width of the waveguide is chosen so that the number of propagating channels in the empty waveguide is @xmath42 .",

    "this is manifest in the broadening of the cumulant correlation function with frequency shift of the transmission eigenvalues normalized by their average values , @xmath44 seen in fig .",

    "the correlation frequency is taken as the frequency shift at which the correlation function falls to half its value.,width=324 ]    we found that , along with the changes in the spectral correlation function of the magnitude of transmission of the eigenchannels , the correlation of their field speckle patterns changes .",

    ", with the waveform of @xmath28 at a shifted frequency @xmath47.,width=324 ]    the falling transmission and growing correlation frequency of eigenchannel correlation functions for lower transmission eigenchannels suggests that lower - transmission eigenchannels may be composed of modes that are spectrally more remote from the excitation frequency .",
    "for a given mode , with lorentzian line normalized to unity at the line center , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the response of the field associated with the mode . here , @xmath50 is the frequency of the incident wave , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the central frequency and linewidth of the mode , the fractional change in intensity falls more slowly with frequency shift as the shift , @xmath53 , increases .",
    "similarly , the phase derivative with frequency shift associated with the mode , which is related to the delay time is smaller and falls more slowly with increasing frequency shift from @xmath51 .    .",
    "bandwidth @xmath54 of the gaussian pulse is 1/3 of the linewidth @xmath52 of the lorentzian mode .",
    "the peak in the response is seen to move towards the time of the incident pulse.,width=324 ]    the dynamic response of lower transmission eigenchannels bears a similarity to systematic changes in pulsed transmission as the excitation frequency is shifted further off resonance . in fig .",
    "4 , we consider the changing dynamic response to an exciting pulse which is tuned away from resonance with a single mode .",
    "the modal response for excitation on - resonance is delayed relative to the incident pulse , while the response becomes more prompt as the excitation is shifted off resonance , with the peak of the transmitted pulse nearly coinciding with that of the incident pulse .",
    "this trend is similar to the changing character of transmission through a random medium with increasing eigenchannel index @xmath18 shown in figs .",
    "the increasingly prompt response to an incident pulse of radiation as the pulse is shifted off resonance is also exhibited in two level systems such as nuclear spins or electronic transitions in atoms in nuclear magnetic or optical nutation @xcite .",
    "the pulsed response in these cases is explained in terms of the nutation of the magnetization or of a generalized optical dipole moment about the effective field in the frame of reference rotating at the excitation frequency .",
    "far off - resonance , the effective driving field and consequentially the rabi frequency is large so that the magnetization or effective polarization rapidly follows the exciting pulse .      to explore the dynamical and spectral characteristics of transmission eigenchannels and the wide range of transmission eigenvalues , we express the tm as a superposition of contributions of the modes as , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the tm of the @xmath57th mode on resonance and gives frequency variation of the field associated with the mode .",
    "the elements @xmath58 of @xmath56 describe the coupling from incident channel _ a _ into the @xmath57th mode of the open system and then coupling into output channel _ b _ @xcite .",
    "the modal tm can be expressed via the singular value decomposition as @xmath59 .",
    "the transmitted flux for excitation by the @xmath18th column of @xmath60 is @xmath61 .",
    "we find small changes in the output speckle patterns of modes in the analysis of transmitted field spectra into modes .",
    "this may be an inherent property of open systems or due to an inadequacy of the modal analysis . as a result ,",
    "the columns in the modal tm are not strictly proportional , though they are highly correlated and @xmath56 is nearly of rank one .",
    "@xmath62 of the @xmath56 determined from fitting field spectra to the sum of modes , does not vanish , but is typically small with @xmath63 , while @xmath64 .",
    "nonetheless , for the present purpose of exploring the qualitative properties of transmission eigenchannels , the modal tm can be approximated as , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the incoming and outgoing field patterns of the first transmission eigenchannel for the mode .",
    "therefore a particular mode is most effectively excited by illuminating the sample with the incident pattern , @xmath66 with transmission @xmath68 .",
    "associating low transmission eigenchannels with off - resonance modes is in keeping with the understanding that discrete peaks in transmission in deeply localized media correspond to being on resonance with a mode of the medium .",
    "more generally , however , the number of modes which individually contribute to transmission at a level greater than @xmath69 is much greater than the number of channels @xmath4 .",
    "the degree of excitation of modes falls with frequency shift as a lorentzian , with an inverse square decay which is slow compared to the exponential falloff of transmission eigenvalues with increasing @xmath18 .",
    "thus the remoteness of a transmission eigenchannel from resonance with modes does not by itself explain the small values of transmission eigenvalues for high indices @xmath18 .",
    "to investigate the modal makeup of the transmission eigenchannels , we consider the correlation function between the normalized output field patterns of the @xmath57th mode , @xmath67 , and the @xmath18th eigenchannel , @xmath28 , for a wave with frequency @xmath50 shifted from the central frequency of the mode by @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "we see in fig .",

    "the peak in the correlation function is seen to shift and broaden with increasing @xmath18 . because simulations are carried out in a sample with @xmath42 , the degree of correlation at large frequency shifts at which the speckle patterns of modes are statistically independent , does not vanish and approaches the value @xmath72 .     between the normalized output field pattern of the @xmath57th mode , @xmath67 , and the @xmath18th eigenchannel , @xmath28 , for a wave shifted from the central frequency of the mode by @xmath73.,width=324 ]    the way that modes are superposed to give @xmath5",
    "can be explained in terms of the decomposition of the tm into the sum of modal tms .",
    "the various factors involved can be appreciated by considering them sequentially following fig .",
    "the middle set of red triangles is the average of the incoherent sum of modal contributions to transmission for incident wave @xmath27 with the output wave projected onto the 2d space of @xmath28 and @xmath74 .",
    "the lower set of blue square gives the flux associated with the projections onto @xmath28 from all modes and is equal to @xmath5.,width=324 ]    the upper set of green circles in fig .",
    "6a gives the average of the incoherent sum of flux in all modes in the frequency range studied when the sample is excited by the eigenchannels @xmath27 for @xmath75 .",
    "this may be written as , @xmath76 .",
    "next , we consider the average of the incoherent sum of modal contributions to transmission for the incident wave @xmath27 with the component of the transmitted wave projected onto the space of output eigenchannel @xmath28 , @xmath77 .",
    "this is shown as the middle set of red triangles in fig .",
    "transmission is further reduced by the random phasing of the projections onto @xmath28 from all modes .",
    "this can be visualized using a vector model in the two - dimensional space of speckle patterns which are the in- and out - of - phase components of @xmath28 , @xmath28 and @xmath74 .",
    "this is shown in fig . 7 for eigenchannel @xmath6 and 3 at a specific frequency .     onto the @xmath78-axis for the incident wave of the first transmission eigenchannel @xmath79 in a single sample configuration.at a particular frequency .",
    "the resultant is @xmath80 .",
    "the same as ( a ) but for the third transmission eigenchannel with incident wave @xmath81 and projection is onto the @xmath82-axis .",
    "many modes with vectors of random phase contribute.,width=324 ]    the square of the length of the resultant vector , which lies along @xmath28 , is equal to the transmission eigenvalue @xmath5 .",
    "the resultant for @xmath6 is seen in fig .",
    "7a to be composed largely of a single vector .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath83 , the resultant is formed by the superposition of many vectors with comparable magnitudes and with angles distributed over @xmath41 radiance .",
    "the resultant is even shorter than the length of several of the individual contributions .",
    "this illustrates the strong suppression of lower transmission eigenchannels by destructive interference of waves associated with different modes of the medium , and provides a physical model for the small transmission eigenchannels found by dorokhov .",
    "in addition to affording a qualitative description of pulse transmission and the large dynamical range of the transmission eigenvalues , the modal tm may be exploited to efficiently excite a specific mode in pulsed and steady - state transmission .",
    "we demonstrate this in microwave measurements of the spectrum of the tm carried out in collections of randomly positioned alumina spheres , in which the high transmission eigenchannels can be determined with good accuracy @xcite .",
    "the spheres of diameter 0.95 cm and refractive index 3.14 are embedded in styrofoam shells to give an alumina sphere volume fraction of 0.068 .",
    "measurements are carried out in the frequency range just above the first mie resonance of the spheres at 10 ghz in which scattering is strong .",
    "the spheres are contained within a section of a copper tube region of length @xmath84 cm and diameter 7.3 cm .",
    "the field transmission coefficients are measured between points on the incident and output cross sections of the tube with use of a vector network analyzer .",
    "the source and detection antennas are the exposed 4-mm - long central conductors of a microwave cable .",
    "the antennas are moved over a grid of 49 points using translation stages . in the frequency range 10.13 - 10.18",
    "ghz , the empty portion of the waveguide supports @xmath85 transverse propagation modes .",
    "the sample is drawn from an ensemble of samples for which _ g_=0.37 .",
    "the impact of absorption on the statistics of transmission is removed by fourier transforming the field spectra into the time domain then multiplying the time signal by @xmath86 , and finally , fourier transforming back into the frequency domain @xcite . here",
    "@xmath87 is the delay from the peak of the incident pulse and @xmath88 is the absorption rate .",
    "the transmission eigenvalues for the tm corrected for absorption are summed to give the transmittance spectrum shown in fig . 8a .",
    "indicates that mode 28 is selectively excited.,width=324 ]    the degree to which a single mode can be selectively excited by an incident pulse with a bandwidth that overlaps several modes with different decay rates can be seen in the decay of the transmitted pulse .",
    "to evaluate the selective excitation of modes , we first find the central frequency and linewidth of the modes .",
    "this is accomplished by the simultaneous fit of the modal expansion of field transmission spectra with a common set of @xmath51 and @xmath52 for all pairs of source and detector positions .",
    "the central frequencies and linewidths of the modes are indicated in fig .",
    "once the set of @xmath51 and @xmath52 are found , the modal tms @xmath56 can be found from the decomposition of the spectrum of the tm into a sum over modal tms .    the variation in time of the transmitted flux due to a gaussian pulse multiplying various incident waveforms is shown in fig . 8b .",
    "the carrier frequency of the incident pulse of 10.1703 ghz lies between the central frequencies of the 27th and 28th modes of 10.1679 and 10.1714 ghz .",
    "the transmitted pulse is determined by the time dependent transmitted fields , which are obtained from the fourier transform of the product of the gaussian in the frequency domain as the dashed black curve , shown in fig .",
    "8a , and the corresponding field transmission spectrum .",
    "the incident patterns of the pulses in fig .",
    "8b are a plane wave and the waveforms corresponding to the first eigenchannels of the tm for modes 27 and 28 at the central frequencies of these modes , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the decay rates of these modes are @xmath91 and @xmath92 . at long time , transmission for the various excitation waveforms decays at the rate of 28th modes which is the longest - lived of the modes excited by the pulse . for the incident waveform @xmath93 , the wave is seen to decay from its peak value with a constant decay rate @xmath94 , indicating that the 28th mode is selectively excited . for incident waveform @xmath95 ,",
    "most of the energy decays at the higher decay rate of the 27th mode at earlier times .",
    "in contrast , for plane - wave illumination , the oscillation of transmission at early times indicates the beating between two excited modes .",
    "in addition , the transmission averaged over time for the plane wave is well below the level for the incident waves that specifically excite one or another of the two spectrally close modes .",
    "this is because though all transmission eigenchannels are approximately equally represented in an incident plane wave , the lower transmission eigenchannels do not contribute substantially to transmission .",
    "the ratio of the integrated flux for a pulse with carrier frequency at @xmath90 with incident waveforms of @xmath93 and a plane wave is 34 .",
    "individual modes can be selected when either the correlation between the field speckle patterns of modes is small or when the modes are separated by at least a linewidth of the broader mode .",
    "when these conditions do not hold , however , the first transmission eigenchannels for the modes may be similar and it may no longer be possible to excite a single mode via illumination on the incident surface . indeed , the selective excitation of modes in these circumstances can violate the principle of the conservation of energy .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "9 , that the first singular value of @xmath56 , and hence @xmath96 , may exceed unity , when illuminating the sample with the first transmission eigenchannel at the central frequency of mode # 7 10.0215 ghz as indicated by the dashed line . since the two modes primarily excited overlap spectrally and the field speckle patterns associated interfere destructively , the overall transmission is below unity .",
    "this is seen in the vector diagram in fig .",

    "the opposite sign and so leads to a small resultant vector .    ) for the first transmission eigenchannel at the central frequency of the mode 7 is shown .",
    "the first modal singular value for mode 7 alone is seen to correspond to a transmission coefficient greater than unity .",
    "because the speckle patterns of modes 7 and 8 are similar , the modes can not be selectively excited and transmission is therefore smaller than unity.,width=324 ]",
    "in summary , we have shown that along with the well - known strong variation in transmission eigenvalues with eigenchannel index _",
    "n _ , dramatic changes emerge in their temporal and spectral characteristics .",
    "these changes point the way to the origin of the puzzling large range of transmission eigenvalues and provide the basis for the efficiently exciting a medium in specific modes .",
    "an incident gaussian pulse with the waveform of the @xmath18th transmission eigenchannel at the central frequency of the pulse rises earlier with a peak in transmission that shifts towards the center of the pulse as @xmath18 increases .",
    "this makes it possible to extend the realm over which transmission can be controlled from the steady - state to the time domain . in line with the changes in the transmitted pulse with increasing",
    "@xmath18 , the spectral correlation frequency of lower transmission eigenchannels broadens significantly .",
    "we also find that the speckle pattern of the highest transmission eigenchannel is correlated while the patterns of low transmission eigenchannels are anti - correlated with modes resonant with the incident wave .",
    "these results show that the lower the transmission eigenchannel , the greater is the frequency shift of the modes forming them from the excitation frequency .",
    "these changes in transmission in the time and frequency domains arise because lower - transmission eigenhannel are made up of modes that are further from resonance with the incident wave .",
    "the explanation of the exponentially small values of steady - state and pulsed transmission requires an additional factor - the increasingly potent destructive interference among the larger number of modes contributing to lower transmission eigenchannels .",
    "these findings give a qualitative understanding of the modal make up of transmission eigenchannels and of the dynamic and spectral properties of transmission eigenchannels .",
    "a theoretical treatment of the spectral correlation of eigenchannel waveforms @xcite and their correlation with modal waveforms are of importance in controlling broadband transmission .",
    "the variation of the the minimum reflection eigenchannel with gain has recently been discussed in terms of their modal makeup @xcite .",
    "expressions for these quantities would make it possible to more reliably anticipate the degree to which modes can be selected within a medium and transmitted pulses can be shaped .",
    "the descriptions of pulsed transmission in terms of transmission eigenchannels and modes differ in many respects .",
    "the incident waveform of a transmission eigenchannel @xmath27 changes with frequency , while modal waveforms are independent of frequency .",
    "however , in practice , the waveform of incident pulses is fixed over the bandwidth of the pulse so that more than a single transmission eigenchannel is excited by an incident pulse .",
    "low - transmission eigenchannels are correlated over a wide frequency range and a short broadband pulse may excite a single eigenchannel but a large number of modes . on the other hand , for high - transmission eigenchannels in samples with",
    "spectrally overlapping modes , a pulse with fixed incident waveform and with spectral width greater than the correlation frequency of the eigenchannel may excite several eigenchannels a small number of modes over the frequency range of the pulse .",
    "another difference between the eigenchannel and mode descriptions of transmission is that eigenchannels are a complete orthogonal set over the sample surface , while the field patterns of quasi - normal modes over a cross section are not orthogonal .",
    "we find in simulations and measurements that the output speckle patterns of modes vary slightly with incident channel . as a result ,",
    "modal tms are not of rank one .",
    "the impact of the openness @xcite of the sample on the modal analysis of the transmission eigenchannels is therefore of great interest and requires further study .",
    "the description of eigenchannels in terms of modes points the way towards efficient pulsed excitation of a medium and provides a basis for selecting specific modes .",
