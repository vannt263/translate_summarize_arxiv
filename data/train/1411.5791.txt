    "within the droplet scaling theory of classical spin - glasses in finite dimensions @xmath6@xcite , the two universal critical exponents that characterize the zero - temperature fixed point can be defined by considering , in each disordered sample @xmath7 of volume @xmath8 , the two ground states associated to two different boundary conditions , for instance periodic ( p ) and anti - periodic ( ap ) .",
    "the difference between the two ground states defines a system - size domain - wall :    \\(i ) the scaling of its energy @xmath9 with respect to the linear size @xmath10 defines the droplet or stiffness exponent @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an @xmath14 random variable of zero mean .",
    "the numerical values measured in dimensions @xmath0 and @xmath2 read ( see @xcite and references therein ) @xmath15    \\(ii ) the scaling of its surface @xmath16 ( number of bonds belonging to the domain wall ) defines the fractal dimension @xmath17 of the domain - wall @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an @xmath14 positive random variable . the numerical values measured in dimensions @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath2 @xcite read @xmath20 moreover in dimension @xmath0 , the domain - wall of fractal dimension @xmath21 has been characterized as an sle process @xcite .",
    "the fractal dimension @xmath17 plays in particular a major role in the chaos properties of spin - glasses with respect to temperature and to disorder perturbations @xcite , as well as in the dynamics @xcite .    from the point of view of real - space renormalization",
    ", spin - glasses have been mostly studied within the migdal - kadanoff approximation @xcite where the hypercubic lattice is effectively replaced by a hierarchical fractal lattice whose structure is exactly renormalizable by construction @xcite : this approximation reproduces very well the values of the droplet exponent in dimensions @xmath0 and @xmath2 ( eq [ thetahypercubic ] ) , but not the surface dimension which is fixed to the trivial value @xmath22 if one insists on keeping the hypercubic lattice in dimension @xmath23 , the precise definition of an appropriate renormalization procedure has remained very difficult .",
    "the reason can be understood by considering a standard block renormalization using the maximal block size @xmath24 : if one decomposes the volume @xmath8 into @xmath25 blocks of volume @xmath26 and compute the ground states in each block , the residual coupling between two blocks is the sum over @xmath27 initial couplings of random signs , leading to the too high value @xmath28 this poor value comes from the facts that the domain - walls have been assumed to be of dimension @xmath29 and have been fixed at the middle of the sample independently of the disorder realization . to obtain better results , it is thus necessary to build correlated clusters with boundaries adapted to each disorder realization . in the present paper ,",
    "we thus introduce and study numerically some simple strong disorder real - space renormalization in dimensions @xmath0 and @xmath2 , and obtain that it is able to reproduce very well the fractal dimensions @xmath17 quoted in eq .",
    "[ dshypercubic ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the principle of the strong disorder real - space renormalization at zero temperature is described in section [ sec_rg ] .",

    "for a finite - dimensional spin - glass of hamiltonian @xmath30 where @xmath31 are classical spins , and where @xmath32 are the random gaussian couplings of zero mean , we would like to construct the ground state via some simple strong disorder real - space renormalization procedure .      for each spin",
    "@xmath33 , we thus consider its local field @xmath34 and compute its largest coupling in absolute value , corresponding to some index @xmath35 @xmath36 we ask whether the local field @xmath37 can be dominated by the first term whatever the values taken by the spins @xmath38 of the second term .",
    "the worst case is of course when all the spins @xmath38 of the second term in eq .",
    "[ hloci2 ] are such that @xmath39 all have the same sign , so that their contribution to the local field is maximal .",
    "it is thus convenient to introduce the difference @xmath40    if @xmath41 , the sign of the local field @xmath42 will be determined by the sign of the first term @xmath43 for all values taken by the other spins @xmath38 with @xmath44 @xmath45 then the spin @xmath46 can be eliminated via @xmath47 so that the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "[ hsg ] becomes @xmath48 where the renormalized couplings concerning the spin @xmath49 read @xmath50    for a site @xmath51 having coordinence @xmath52 ( i.e. only two neighbors ) , the difference @xmath53 is always positive , so that the renormalization above is exact : this is the case in particular in dimension @xmath54 and in the migdal - kadanoff approximation in dimension @xmath23 ( see sections 4.2 and 4.3 of ref @xcite for more details ) .",
    "however `` the worst is not always true '' : indeed in a frustrated spin - glass , the worst case discussed above where all the spins @xmath38 are such that @xmath39 have all the same sign , is expected to be rather atypical . in the absence of other informations , it is much more natural to compare with a sum of random terms of absolute values",
    "@xmath32 and of random signs , i.e. to replace the difference @xmath55 of eq .",
    "[ deltai ] by @xmath56 note that for the case of coordinence @xmath52 , @xmath57 actually coincides with @xmath55 , so that the exactness discussed above is the same .",
    "but for coordinence @xmath58 , we expect that @xmath57 is a better indicator of the relative dominance of the maximal coupling for the different spins .",
    "we have thus chosen to introduce the strong disorder renormalization procedure based on the variable @xmath57 as we now describe .      at each step , the spin - glass hamiltonian of the form of eq .",
    "[ hsg ] contains @xmath59 remaining spins .",
    "each spin @xmath33 is characterized by the variable @xmath57 of eq .",
    "[ omegaii ] computed from the couplings @xmath32 connected to @xmath33 .",
    "the iterative renormalization procedure is defined by the following elementary decimation step :    find the spin @xmath51 with the maximal @xmath57 @xmath60 the elimination of the spin @xmath46 via the rule of eq .",
    "[ elimsi0 ] yields that all its couplings @xmath61 with @xmath62 are transferred to the spin @xmath49 via the renormalization rule of eq .",
    "[ jr ] @xmath63    the procedure ends when only a single spin @xmath64 is left : the two values @xmath65 label the two ground states related by a global flip of all the spins . from the choice @xmath66",
    ", we may reconstruct all the values of the decimated spins via the rule of eq .",
    "[ elimsi0 ] .    in the sections [ sec_rg2d ] and [ sec_rg3d ] , we study numerically this renormalization procedure in dimensions @xmath0 and @xmath2 to see whether the corresponding exponents @xmath11 and @xmath17 are closer to the numerical values of eqs [ thetahypercubic ] and [ dshypercubic ] than the block values of eqs [ thetablock ] and [ dsblock ] . but let us first mention similarities and differences with previous works .",
    "the simplest greedy procedure introduced for classical spin - glasses consists in satisfying the bonds in the order of the absolute values of the couplings @xmath67 unless a closed loop appears @xcite .",
    "so the two differences with the present procedure is that    \\(i ) here we decimate spins according to the biggest variable @xmath57 of eq .",
    "[ omegaii ] , instead of decimating bonds according to the biggest @xmath67    \\(ii ) here the couplings are renormalized according to eq .",
    "[ rulejr ] , whereas in the greedy procedure of refs @xcite , no renormalization is mentioned .    in dimensions",

    "[ dshypercubic ] at least in dimension @xmath0 ) .    in the context of the one - dimensional spin - glasses with power - law couplings",
    "@xmath70 , we have studied recently a related strong disorder renormalization procedure able to reproduce the correct droplet exponent @xcite , using the strong hierarchy of initial couplings with the distance .      as a final remark",
    ", we should also stress the difference with the strong disorder renormalization method ( see @xcite for a review ) that has been developed for disordered _ quantum _ spin models either in @xmath54 @xcite or in @xmath71 @xcite . in these quantum spin models ,",
    "the idea is to decimate the strongest coupling @xmath72 remaining in the whole system : the renormalized couplings obtained via second order perturbation theory of quantum mechanics are obtained as ratios of couplings and are thus typically much weaker than the decimated coupling @xmath72 , so that the procedure is consistent and even asymptotically exact at the critical point where the typical renormalized couplings _ decays _ as @xmath73 .",
    "this is thus completely different from the problem of _ classical _ spin - glasses at zero temperature considered in the present paper , where the droplet scaling is a power - law @xmath74 , and where the renormalization rule is of the form of eq .",
