    "because of these complications it is not so easy to make a direct comparison between the first- and second- quantized approaches even for this relatively simple system .",
    "but , bergman @xcite demonstrated recently that the two approaches are in fact completely equivalent once the renormalized strength of the @xmath3 interaction is chosen to be related in a specific way to the self - adjoint extension parameter entering the quantum mechanical approach .    in two spatial dimensions , we have another kind of system where similar problems arise naturally  those involving anyons @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanically , anyons can be regarded as flux - charge composites and so the relative dynamics of the two anyon system is essentially the aharonov - bohm scattering problem @xcite .",
    "the latter problem has certain ambiguity as regards the choice of boundary condition at the singular point of the aharonov - bohm potential , namely , at the location of the flux line .",
    "according to the theory of self - adjoint extension , it is known that there exist a one - parameter family of acceptable boundary conditions @xcite , including as a special case the often - assumed hard - core boundary condition(appropriate to an impenetrable flux line)@xcite .",
    "in perturbative treatments , however , this boundary condition is not easily incorporated and without paying due attention to it one ends up with a divergent perturbation series@xcite . among various proposals made to amend this situation@xcite , a particularly interesting one is to introduce an extra @xmath0-function potential of suitable strength@xcite , the role of which is to secure a finite(and correct ) perturbation theory .",

    "needless to say , it should be important to understand the physical role of such contact interaction term and also its significance within the first - quantized approach .",
    "this is especially so in view of possible relevance of the chern - simons field theory in some of most remarkable phenomena in planar physics such as the quantum hall effect .",
    "a serious study on the above issue was made recently by amelino - camelia and bak @xcite .",
    "they showed that lower - order field theory calculations of the scattering amplitudes agree with the corresponding quantum mechanical results obtained using the method of self - adjoint extension , provided the strength of the @xmath3-interaction is suitably related to the self - adjoint extension parameter .",

    "a new feature is that , if the strength of the @xmath3-interaction is equal to the critical value appropriate to the so - called self - dual limit@xcite , the field theory turns out to be ultraviolet finite@xcite and yields the anyon scattering amplitude consistent with the scale - invariant boundary conditions .",

    "( [ eq:229 ] ) .",
    "we may now assert that the quantum field theory defined through the action ( [ eq:31 ] ) and renormalized as above provides an equivalent description of many anyon quantum mechanics with a general boundary condition as considered in the previous section .    before closing this section",
    ", we shall emphasize once again the role of the contact interaction terms in the quantum description of anyons . as was explained in sec .",
    "[ se:2 ] , we need them to implement dynamically ( i.e. , through the hamiltonian ) a suitable boundary condition at the two - anyon coincidence point . as such , their presence is in no way an artifact of perturbation theory .",
    "they essentially go over to the field theoretic description , where one usually does not consider the boundary condition separately .",
    "in fact , without including the contact term in the lagrangian density , the given field theory is not renormalizable and hence does not lead to a well - defined theory .",
    "the equivalence between the first- and second - quantized approaches can be established only when we include the appropriate contact interaction term .",
    "for instance , in the special case of anyons satisfying the hard - core boundary condition , the lagrangian density of the corresponding field theory reads @xmath232 and this happens to be an ultraviolet finite theory .",
    "due to the singular nature of anyon interaction at short distance , one has a well - defined many anyon quantum mechanics only after a suitable boundary condition at the two - anyon coincidence point has been chosen .",
    "this introduces a new free parameter  the self - adjoint extension parameter @xmath132 in the theory , which serves to specify the chosen boundary condition .",
    "we have shown that this boundary condition , in its full generality , can be implemented dynamically by introducing a suitable contact interaction term in the anyon hamiltonian .",
    "this system admits a quantum field theoretic description in the form of a chern - simons gauge theory , and we have here shown that the @xmath233-type contact interaction assumes a crucial role not only in securing a well - defined theory but also in realizing the full equivalence with the quantum mechanical approach .",
    "the strength of the renormalized contact coupling in the field - theoretic description is related to the self - adjoint extension parameter which encodes the quantum mechanical boundary condition .",
    "we have a few comments to make .",
    "first of all , note that more general kinds of anyons ( other than the ones we discussed here ) are possible , such as those obeying so - called matrix(or mutual ) statistics @xcite and also those obeying non - abelian statistics @xcite .",
    "both quantum - mechanical and field - theoretic descriptions for these generalized ( but still nonrelativistic ) anyons were discussed by various authors @xcite without paying due attention to the contact interaction terms .",
    "these must be corrected along the line discussed in this paper . [ in this",
    "regards , see especially ref .",
    "@xcite where the related issue is studied in non - abelian chern - simons field theory with the help of some lower - order perturbative calculations . ]",
    "another problem deserving more study is to look at related issues from the viewpoint of _ relativistic _ chern - simons field theory , as was considered recently in ref .",
    "@xcite whithin one - loop approximation .",
    "finally , we need to have more information on those specific features of an anyon system which depend crucially on the self - adjoint extension parameter(or , equivalently , on the coupling strength of the @xmath233 interaction in the field theoretic approach ) . after all ,",
    "if anyon play a role in real physical phenomena , it will be an experimental question to determine what specific boundary condition the given anyons satisfy .",
