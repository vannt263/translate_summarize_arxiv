    "in two previous papers , we developed a model of thermal comptonization and disk thermal reprocessing to explain the data from recent multiwavelength monitoring observations of the type 1 seyfert galaxies ngc  3516 and ngc  7469 ( chiang & blaes 2001 , hereafter paper  i ; chiang 2002 , hereafter paper  ii ) .",
    "the essential features of this model were proposed by poutanen , krolik , & ryde ( 1997 ) to account for the different spectral states of the galactic x - ray binary cygnus  x-1 ; and a simplified version was used by zdziarski , lubiski , & smith ( 1999 ) to model the correlation seen in x - ray binaries and type 1 seyfert galaxies between the x - ray spectral index and the relative strength of the compton reflection continuum . a key element of this model is the feedback occurring between a centrally located comptonizing plasma and the thin accretion disk that encircles it .",
    "the disk reprocesses x - rays from the central region , thus providing a significant fraction of the seed photons for the comptonization process itself . for a given set of optical ,",
    "uv , and x - ray data , this feedback mechanism determines the equilibrium state of the comptonizing plasma . by computing the equilibria required by the ngc 3516 and ngc 7469 data",
    ", we found that the seemingly uncorrelated optical / uv and x - ray continuum variations exhibited by these sources could be described almost entirely in the context of this model .",
    "furthermore , in modeling these variations , we were able to constrain the central black hole masses and the accretion rates of these objects ; and we were able to compute the x - ray continuum at energies extending beyond @xmath7  kev , a part of the spectrum that will soon be made more accessible by the _ international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory ( integral)_.    during an intensive three day monitoring campaign in 1998 april with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ , the _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( asca ) _ , and the _ hubble space telescope _ , ngc  3516 exhibited an optical continuum that was surprisingly constant , consisting of only @xmath8% variations , while simultaneously showing @xmath9% changes in the 210  kev x - ray flux ( edelson et al .",
    "this apparent lack of response by the optical continuum to the changes in the x - ray flux has been taken as evidence against the thermal reprocessing model for the optical and uv variability . however , despite the relatively small amplitude of its fluctuations , the optical continuum varied essentially simultaneously across a wide range of wavelengths , in a manner consistent with disk thermal reprocessing ( e.g. , krolik et al .",
    "1991 ; courvoisier & clavel 1991 ; collin - souffrin 1991 ) . in paper",
    "i , we showed that a constant optical continuum in the presence of large x - ray fluctuations could be reconciled with the disk thermal reprocessing model if the radial extent , @xmath10 , of the central comptonizing plasma varied inversely with the x - ray luminosity , @xmath11 , so that the flux incident upon the disk at moderately large radii remained constant .",
    "slight departures from the @xmath12 relationship would then produce the highly correlated , low amplitude variations seen in the optical continuum of ngc 3516 .",
    "we found that the range of x - ray fluxes and spectral indexes exhibited by this source is naturally accommodated by this behavior .",
    "the interpretation of the ngc 7469 data is more complex .",
    "data from a 30 day monitoring campaign in 1996 june ",
    "july with the _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ and _ rxte _  showed that the uv continuum at @xmath131350  and the 210  kev x - ray light curves were not correlated in any simple way ( nandra et al .",
    "although the amplitude and time scales of the most prominent variations in the two datasets were comparable , some features in the uv occurred nearly simultaneously with similar looking features in the x - rays , while other features that were similar in the two light curves were offset by @xmath14  days .",
    "a quantitative analysis revealed that the strongest correlation between the two light curves corresponded to the uv variations _ leading _ those of the x - rays by several days , contrary to naive expectations of the thermal reprocessing model .",
    "nandra et al .",
    "( 2000 ) were able to explain these data , at least qualitatively , by noting that the uv fluxes were highly correlated at near zero temporal lag with the x - ray spectral index and also with a broad band ( 0.1100  kev ) extrapolation of the 210  kev x - ray power - law .",
    "when we applied the thermal comptonization / disk reprocessing model to these data , we found that rather large changes in the bolometric x - ray luminosity were required in order to produce the relatively large variations seen in the uv ( paper  ii ) .",
    "since the x - ray continua for this source are relatively soft and are constrained in the 210  kev band by the _ rxte_/pca  observations , a broad range of temperatures for the comptonizing electrons is needed so that the thermal comptonization process can produce a concomitantly large range of x - ray luminosities .    despite the difficulties associated with explaining these observations , the application of the model to these data yielded some encouraging results .",
    "first , the relatively large inner truncation radius of the thin disk , @xmath15  cm , that we found by fitting the optical and uv continuum data for ngc 7469 is consistent with that inferred from _",
    "asca _  observations of the narrow iron k@xmath16 emission line by guainazzi et al .",
    "( 1994 ) if the broad line region reverberation mapping estimates of the black hole mass are correct ( peterson & wandel 2000 ) .",
    "second , the value we inferred for the product of the black hole mass and accretion rate , @xmath17  m@xmath3  yr@xmath18 , agrees with that found by collier et al.(1998 ) who examined time delays between uv and optical continuum bands under the assumption of thermal reprocessing .",
    "third , a global energy balance condition is satisfied by our models for both ngc  3516 and ngc  7469 wherein the total bolometric luminosity is consistent with the inferred accretion rate assuming nominal black hole masses of @xmath19m@xmath1  for each source .",
    "in the present paper , we analyze simultaneous optical , uv , and x - ray data for the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548 which were taken during two separate monitoring observations : a ground - based - optical/_iue_/_ginga_campaign in 198990 ( peterson et al .",

    "we have fit the _ ginga",
    "_  data from the nine epochs that were simultaneous with the _ iue _  observations using a power - law + reflection model for the continuum components ( the pexrav model [ magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ] in xspec ) , a gaussian function for the fluorescent iron k@xmath16 emission line , and a galactic absorbing column fixed at @xmath25 cm .",
    "in addition , we included an ionized absorber that is illuminated by a continuum with the same spectral index as the cut - off power - law ( the absori model [ done et al .",
    "1992 ] in xspec ) .",
    "this latter component is required to model the absorption at energies below @xmath8  kev that can not be accounted for by the galactic absorbing column alone .",
    "this spectral model is similar to that used by magdziarz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to fit these same data .",
    "the difference is that we do not model the so - called `` soft excess '' since we do not find significant residuals below @xmath26  kev that would indicate the need for a separate spectral component at these energies .",
    "nonetheless , we find very similar x - ray spectral indices and fluxes in the 210  kev band as do magdziarz et al .",
    "the parameters from the fits to the _ ginga _  data along with the corrected optical and uv fluxes are given in table  [ iue_ginga_data ] .",
    "the simultaneous _ euve _ , _ asca _ , and _ rxte _",

    ", we have used only spectral parameters obtained from fitting _ rxte_/pca  data .",
    "the _ rxte_observations covered a greater period of time than did the _ asca_observations and overlapped more with the optical observations we discuss below .",

    ". however , the most recent versions of these programs as of september 2002 , pcarmf v8.0 and pcarsp v8.0 , produce response matrices that are sufficiently different from the earlier ones so that the newly fitted spectral indices differ from those presented in chiang et al .",

    "for the _ rxte _  data , there is clearly a slight correlation between the reflection fraction and the photon spectral index such that the harder power - law spectra for the new fits are accompanied by weaker contributions from compton reflection .",
    "however , the changes in @xmath27 are not sufficiently large to account for the changes in the underlying spectral index .",
    "simultaneous uv fluxes do not exist for the 1998 _ euve_/_asca_/_rxte_observations , but we do have optical data at @xmath23  for seven of the epochs which were kindly provided to us by m.  dietrich ( dietrich et al .  2001 ) .",
    "these data were extinction and starlight corrected as described in magdziarz et al .",
    "the corrected flux values are given in table  [ rxte_data ] .",
    "unfortunately , the optical flux measurements were not all strictly simultaneous with the _ rxte _  observations . for epoch 1.0 ,",
    "the flux listed in table  [ rxte_data ] was taken at jd@xmath28 , more than 8 hours after the _ rxte _  observation window . for epochs 2.12.4 , the optical measurements were taken either at the very beginning or the very end of the _ rxte _  integration intervals which lasted from @xmath29 to @xmath30 hours .",
    "given the uncertainties in the optical fluxes and the occasional sparseness of the coverage ( see dietrich et al.2001 , their fig .  4 ) ,",
    "interpretation of these data as being simultaneous with the x - ray observations should be regarded with caution .",
    "as in papers  i and  ii , we consider a fairly simple model for the central regions of ngc  5548 . a razor thin , flat accretion disk produces thermal emission that comprises the observed optical and uv continuum ; and a centrally located , spherical comptonizing region consisting of a plasma of hot electrons produces the power - law - like x - ray continuum detected at energies @xmath31@xmath32  kev .",
    "the disk is truncated at an inner radius @xmath33 , the comptonizing electrons are assumed to have a uniform temperature @xmath34 , and the plasma sphere has a radius @xmath35 . thermal emission from the disk enters the sphere and provides seed photons for the comptonization process . in turn , x - rays from the sphere illuminate the disk , heating it , and thus causing it to produce thermal emission in excess of that resulting from local viscous dissipation .",
    "the feedback between the disk and sphere regulates the equilibrium temperature of the comptonizing electrons , and variations in the geometry through changes in @xmath36 and/or @xmath10 determine the spectral properties of the x - ray , optical , and uv continua .",
    "this sort of geometry for thermal comptonization in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and galactic x - ray binaries has been explored in detail by a number of authors ( e.g. , shapiro , lightman , & eardley 1976 ; poutanen , krolik , & ryde 1997 ; dove et al .",
    "1997 ; zdziarski , lubiski , & smith 1999 ) .",
    "we model the thermal emission from the surface of the accretion disk as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the disk albedo . the local flux produced by viscous dissipation",
    "is @xmath39 , \\label{fvisc}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit .",
    "note that use of this expression assumes that the torque at the thin disk truncation radius @xmath36 is the same as that for a standard , untruncated thin disk with zero torque at @xmath40 .",
    "we are also assuming that the disk is stationary , except for the variable heating resulting from the incident x - rays .",
    "this incident x - ray flux upon the disk is given as a function of radius by @xmath41 where @xmath11 is the x - ray luminosity of the comptonizing plasma , and the auxiliary function @xmath42 is given by zdziarski et al .",
    "( 1999 ; see also paper  ii ) .",
    "this expression assumes that the x - ray emission is uniform , isotropic , and optically thin throughout the plasma sphere .",

    ".    the function @xmath42 can be approximated by @xmath49 for @xmath50 ( zdziarski et al .",
    "1999 ; see also paper  i ) , and therefore the disk thermal emission follows an @xmath51 distribution whether it results from viscous dissipation or from reprocessing of the x - rays from the central plasma sphere , provided that @xmath52 . under these circumstances ,",
    "the disk surface temperature can be modeled as @xmath53 . using this approximation ,",
    "we have obtained estimates of the disk inner truncation radius @xmath36 and the temperature @xmath54 at this radius by fitting the optical and uv data with equation  ( [ fnu ] ) . applying this procedure to the nine epochs of the 198990 data , we have found the @xmath36-values listed in table  [ ginga_fits ] .",
    "these results depend sensitively on the disk inclination , and that dependence affects the inferred values for the other parameters describing the x - ray portion of the seds .",
    "we will explore the implications of this dependence in  5 .",
    "the underlying relationship between the x - ray luminosity , the black hole mass , and the accretion rate can be seen by using the approximation for @xmath42 ( eq .  [ [ h_approx ] ] ) and the aforementioned fits for @xmath36 and @xmath54 .",
    "since broad line region reverberation mapping estimates of the central black hole mass in ngc  5548 give @xmath55  m@xmath1  ( peterson & wandel 2000 ) , and @xmath56 for all nine of the 198990 epochs , we can neglect the term containing @xmath57 in the expression for @xmath58 ( eq .  [ [ fvisc ] ] ) . using these approximations , the black hole mass and the accretion rate",
    "are related to the x - ray luminosity @xmath11 and the radius of the plasma sphere @xmath10 by @xmath59 since we are assuming that the disk is stationary ( eq .  [ [ fvisc ] ] ) , the non - varying part of the optical / uv sed is modeled by the @xmath60 term on the left - hand side of equation  ( [ mmdot ] ) , while any optical / uv variability in the model must be caused by changes in the thermal reprocessing component represented by the @xmath61 term and/or by changes in the truncation radius @xmath36 .",
    "the values of @xmath11 and @xmath10 are also constrained by the observed 210 kev x - ray flux and spectral index , and by two energy balance conditions .",
    "the first energy balance condition follows from an empirical relation between the x - ray spectral index and the compton amplification factor @xmath62 , which is the ratio of the x - ray luminosity and the luminosity of `` seed '' photons , @xmath63 , entering the comptonizing plasma : @xmath64 the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 have been found from fits to monte carlo calculations of the thermal comptonization process ( malzac , beloborodov , & poutanen 2001 ; see also  4 ) .",
    "if the seed photons consist only of thermal emission from the disk , then @xmath63 is determined by the disk flux distribution @xmath67 and by the geometry of the disk and comptonizing plasma through @xmath10 and @xmath36 : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the disk surface brightness , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is defined in paper  ii and equals the fraction of isotropic emission that enters the central plasma sphere from a disk annulus @xmath72 .",
    "modeling the x - ray spectrum as an exponentially cut - off power - law , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 , a value for @xmath11 can be found using the 210  kev x - ray continuum flux , @xmath75 , and x - ray spectral index , @xmath76 : @xmath77 here @xmath78  kev is an assumed nominal lower cut - off energy , the precise value of which is not important for photon indices @xmath79 , and @xmath80 note that this expression is the incomplete gamma function .",
    "the factor @xmath81 in equation  ( [ lx ] ) parameterizes any anisotropy in the thermal compton emission .",
    "if this emission were isotropic and the plasma sphere were optically thin , then @xmath82 .",
    "because photons from the first scattering order are preferentially scattered back towards the disk , the x - ray intensity incident upon the disk can be larger than the intensity seen by a distant observer ( paper  ii ) .",
    "our monte carlo calculations show that @xmath83 does a reasonable job of modeling this anisotropy for observer inclinations @xmath84@xmath85 ( see  4 ) .",
    "the second energy balance condition is more global in nature and comes from the expectation that the hot plasma is less efficient at radiating accretion power than a standard optically thick accretion disk would be in its place : @xmath86 the quantities @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the luminosities resulting from viscous dissipation for a disk truncated at an inner radius @xmath36 and an `` untruncated '' disk extending to the innermost stable circular orbit @xmath40 , so that @xmath89 for a given value of @xmath40 , equation  ( [ geb ] ) is equivalent to @xmath90 where the efficiency @xmath91 for @xmath92 . ) .",
    "we do not use the more familiar value of @xmath93 since we are neglecting general relativistic effects throughout this work .",
    "] we generally assume that a firm upper limit to the x - ray luminosity is given by @xmath94 .",
    "of course , this high a value would correspond to accretion efficiencies that exceed both that of the standard thin disk and those expected for other models such as advection dominated accretion flows ( adafs ; narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "however , even higher efficiencies are conceivable if the spin energy of the central black hole can be tapped ( e.g. , krolik 1999 ; gammie 1999 ; wilms et al .",
    "2001 ) .    to summarize , we effectively have five relations constraining the properties of the inner accretion flow .",
    "we list them here in terms of their functional dependence on the model parameters and the observationally determined quantities :    @xmath95    [ model_relations ]    the first relation represents equations  ( [ fdisk][fnu ] ) ( or approximately eq .  [ [ mmdot ] ] by itself ) ; and the remaining four relations represent equations  ( [ gamma(a ) ] ) , ( [ ls ] ) , ( [ lx ] ) , and  ( [ global_energy_balance ] ) , respectively .",
    "in these five relations , there are six unknowns is another unknown . for clarity",

[ [ fnu ] ] ) . in order to obtain a unique solution to equations  ( [ model_relations ] ) ,",
    "additional information is necessary .",
    "direct measurement of the roll - over energy @xmath98 would provide the most useful constraints since that would provide estimates of both @xmath11 and @xmath34 , but instruments with the required sensitivity in the relevant energy range are not yet available .",
    "reverberation mapping measurements of the black hole mass can be used to estimate @xmath40 ; but as we will see below , the standard value for ngc 5548 , @xmath55  m@xmath1  ( peterson & wandel 2000 ) , yields accretion rates so low that equation  ( [ global_energy_balance ] ) is violated or that imply electron temperatures that are inconsistent with the observed x - ray continua .",
    "in order to get a sense for how the quantities @xmath40 and @xmath60 can affect the implied solutions , we have solved equations  ( [ model_relations]a  d ) numerically over a grid of values spanning @xmath997)@xmath100m@xmath1  and @xmath101@xmath102  m@xmath1@xmath103  yr@xmath18 , assuming @xmath104 . as an example , in figure  [ kt_vs_mmdot_example ] , the values of @xmath105 obtained from these fits are plotted versus @xmath60 for the 198990 epoch  2 data . since @xmath106 over the entire range of masses , the @xmath57 term in equation  ( [ fdisk ] ) plays a minor role in determining the disk flux distribution , and equation  ( [ mmdot ] ) roughly applies .",
    "consequently , the electron temperatures are nearly independent of @xmath107 and are determined mostly by the quantity @xmath60 .",
    "this functional dependence is shown in figure  [ kt_vs_mmdot_example ] by the various symbols ( corresponding to the different masses ) and by the single solid curve that connects the values of @xmath105 averaged over the masses at each @xmath60 value .",
    "for each black hole mass , we compute the minimum accretion rate that satisfies equation  ( [ global_energy_balance ] ) , @xmath108 where we have taken the accretion efficiency to be @xmath91 .",
    "the dashed curves show the fitted @xmath105 values plotted versus @xmath109 for the specified mass ; solutions of equation  [ model_relations]a  d that also obey equation  [ model_relations]e will lie to the right of the dashed curves .",
    "hence , the intersection of each dashed curve with the solid curve gives the minimum value of @xmath60 that satisfies the energy balance condition ( eq .  [ [ global_energy_balance ] ] ) .",
    "that intersection point also corresponds to the maximum electron temperature that can be achieved for the given mass . for @xmath110  m@xmath1 ,",
    "the electron temperature during epoch  2 must satisfy @xmath111  kev ; while for @xmath112  m@xmath1 , it must satisfy @xmath113  kev .",
    "several observations of the same source in different flux states can place additional limits on the black hole mass @xmath107 and accretion rate @xmath114 , provided the latter is fixed as we are assuming by adopting a stationary thin disk structure . as we described above ,",
    "we use the optical and uv continuum fluxes to determine the disk inner radius , @xmath36 , in each epoch .",
    "in contrast to our previous studies of ngc 3516 and ngc 7469 ( paper  ii ) , the optical and uv data for ngc 5548 do seem to require variations in @xmath36 .",
    "this is evidenced by the relatively large optical / uv color changes occurring over these observations ( table  [ iue_ginga_data ] ) .",
    "these observations are separated in time by intervals ranging from two days to nearly one year .",
    "if variations in @xmath36 result from viscous processes , then any feasible observational time scale would be far too short to expect significant changes .",
    "however , if the @xmath36-variations occur because of thermal instabilities causing the disk to alternately `` puff up '' and then `` deflate '' near the innermost radius of the thin disk , then such variations could occur on a thermal time scale : @xmath115 where @xmath16 is the anomalous viscosity parameter .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the time scales of the @xmath36-variations listed in table  [ ginga_fits ] , except perhaps for the 2-day interval between epochs  4 and  5 that would require somewhat larger values of @xmath16 and/or black hole mass than are indicated in equation  ( [ t_th ] ) .    in figure",
    "[ kt_vs_mmdot_ginga ] , we plot the @xmath105-@xmath60 curves for all nine of the 198990 epochs .",
    "the vertical dotted lines indicate the minimum @xmath60 values for epoch 1 assuming masses @xmath116  m@xmath1 , ordered left - to - right .",
    "these lower limits are greater than the corresponding ones found for the other eight epochs , and so they represent the most restrictive minimum values for @xmath60 .",
    "given these lower limits , a black hole mass of @xmath117  m@xmath1  implies a minimum value of @xmath118  m@xmath3yr@xmath18 and requires rather low electron temperatures for the eight other epochs , with @xmath119  kev in all cases . for temperatures that low ,",
    "the thermal roll - over would be detected in the x - ray spectra taken by instruments such as _ ginga _  and _ rxte_/pca , which have useful sensitivity up to @xmath7@xmath120  kev for the brighter type 1 seyfert galaxies .",
    "of course , the degree to which these observations could detect the effects of a low electron temperature depends on the shape of the thermal comptonization continuum .",
    "although power - laws with exponential cut - offs are often used to model these spectra , detailed thermal comptonization calculations , such as our monte carlo calculations (   5 ) , generally show sharper high energy cut - offs so that the thermal roll - over may not be as evident at lower energies .",
    "furthermore , a strong compton reflection component can hide a low energy thermal roll - over much in the same way it can mask a softer underlying power - law index .",
    "nonetheless , one can adopt a fairly conservative minimum value for @xmath34 as an observational constraint . for our purposes",
    ", we will require @xmath121  kev , which is indicated by the lower dotted horizontal line in figure  [ kt_vs_mmdot_ginga ] .",

    "the seds shown in figure  [ ginga_seds ] often have more power in the comptonized x - ray component than in the optical / uv disk thermal component .",
    "this is still consistent with a radiatively inefficient hot inner flow , because that efficiency should be compared to a radiatively efficient disk at the same radius where most of the accretion power is generated .",
    "indeed , the very fact that the x - rays appear to take up such a large fraction of the bolometric power is strongly suggestive of the accretion flow geometry we are considering here .    applying our calculations to the 1998 observations is problematic since we lack the uv data required to constrain the disk inner radius .",
    "however , having ascertained @xmath107 and @xmath114 from the 198990 data , we can explore the feasible range of disk inner radii for the 1998 epochs in light of our temperature constraint . in figure  [ kt_vs_rmin_rxte ]",

    "if we assume that this upper limit for @xmath36 applies to all of the 1998 observations , then the electron temperature for epoch  3.2 would be @xmath131  kev ( see table  [ rxte_fits ] ) . since we do not consider pair - production or the possibility of a non - thermal component of relativistic electrons , another constraint we are tacitly imposing in this model is that the electron temperatures should satisfy @xmath132 . for temperatures much greater than this ,",
    "the thermalization time scales exceed the cooling time scales , and a non - thermal electron component will arise ( coppi 1999 ) . the presence of a significant non - thermal component would invalidate the energy balance implied by the thermostatic interaction between the disk reprocessed radiation and the comptonization emission from the hot plasma .",
    "therefore , in order to satisfy this implicit upper limit for the temperature , the curves shown in figure  [ kt_vs_rmin_rxte ] suggest that the disk inner radii for these data span a range at least as wide as @xmath133@xmath134  cm . however , for the spectral parameters derived using the 2002 response matrices , the disk inner radius can take _ any single value _ in the range ( 3.1@xmath135  cm _ for all seven epochs _ and still be consistent with electron temperatures that lie within our nominal range of @xmath120@xmath136  kev .",

    "therefore , the mis - match between the continuum levels of the semi - analytic and monte carlo calculations , most clearly seen in the epoch  5 results , can be reduced by adjusting the radial thomson depth of the plasma sphere .",
    "this will , of course , result in different electron temperatures as well .    for the epoch  1 data ,",
    "the shape of the monte carlo sed is more difficult to reconcile with the exponentially cut - off power - law used in our semi - analytic method because for sufficiently high electron temperatures the individual scattering orders are partially resolved in the x - ray spectra .",
    "this illustrates another , observationally - based motivation for an upper limit on the electron temperature .",
    "if the mean separation in energy between the peaks of individual scattering orders exceeds their width , these orders will be partially resolved in the resulting thermal comptonization continuum and will appear as a number of spectral breaks and/or local maxima and minima ( e.g. , skibo & dermer 1995 ) .",
    "empirically , we find from our monte carlo calculations that an upper limit of @xmath132 is required to prevent these features from appearing .",
    "the wide range of electron temperatures , @xmath172@xmath173  kev , that we found for the ground - based/_iue_/_ginga _  data is driven by the relatively broad range of optical / uv fluxes ( see table  [ iue_ginga_data ] ) . in paper",
    "ii , we obtained similar results for the ngc  7469 monitoring observations , which also had large optical / uv variations . in that work",
    ", we were able to narrow the range of temperature changes that was required by allowing the x - ray spectral indices to vary within their 1-@xmath174 uncertainties .",
    "for the ngc  5548 ground - based/_iue_/_ginga _  data , the most conspicuous out - lier is the fit to the epoch  1 data .",
    "those data yield an electron temperature that is at least three times larger than the temperatures found for the other eight epochs .",
    "the epoch  1 data also have an unusually hard x - ray spectral index , @xmath175 .",
    "this value lies at the very low end of the range of spectral indices that are typical for type 1 seyfert galaxies ( zdziarski , poutanen , & johnson 2000 ) .",
    "furthermore , it is substantially smaller than the indices of the other _ ginga _  epochs ( with the notable exception of epoch  8) .",
    "however , as we noted in paper  ii , softer spectra have less x - ray flux at energies @xmath176  kev than do harder spectra for a given value of @xmath105 and a fixed 210 kev flux . in order to reduce @xmath105 for epoch  1",
    ", we would either have to make the x - ray spectrum even harder , i.e. , use @xmath177 , or take a larger value of the 210  kev flux .",
    "setting @xmath178  erg  @xmath179s@xmath18 for epoch  1 , which corresponds to a 10% increase in 210  kev flux over the fitted value ( see table  [ iue_ginga_data ] ) , we obtain a uniform 20% reduction in the equilibrium electron temperature for all values of @xmath60 considered .",
    "the resulting changes in the inferred minimum accretion rates are even smaller : for @xmath180  m@xmath1 , @xmath181 is reduced by 13% , while for @xmath182  m@xmath1 , the reduction is less than 4% .    for the preceding analyses of the ngc 5548 data we have assumed an observer inclination of @xmath183 ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "our calculations are surprisingly sensitive to this value .",
    "since the optical / uv spectral shape for a given epoch is determined largely by the temperature of the disk at the innermost radius , @xmath54 is independent of @xmath184 .",
    "the disk flux is proportional to @xmath185 , so that for a given set of optical / uv data , we have @xmath186 . if the disk emission is dominated by the thermally reprocessed component , then the geometry is determined by the x - ray spectral index ( zdziarski et al .",
    "1999 ) , and we have @xmath187 , @xmath188 , and @xmath189 . inserting these relations into equation  ( [ mmdot ] ) , we obtain @xmath190 where @xmath191 , @xmath192 , and @xmath193 are fiducial values evaluated for @xmath194 .",
    "the implied values of @xmath60 will therefore be larger for smaller @xmath184 .",
    "similarly , the global energy balance condition ( eq .  [ [ global_energy_balance ] ] ) allows us to obtain a ( @xmath184)-scaling for @xmath114 : @xmath195\\frac{l_{x,0}}{\\cos i},\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the fraction of the x - ray luminosity intercepted by the disk . taking the minimum value for @xmath114 in order to have a maximum value for the black hole mass , this expression and equation  ( [ mmdot_cos_i ] ) imply @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "now , the x - ray observations and our ad hoc limits for the electron temperature fix the range of thermal comptonization roll - over energies , and therefore they essentially fix the @xmath11 values for the 198990 data as a whole ( see figs .",
    "[ kt_vs_mmdot_ginga ] and  [ kt_vs_mmdot_30_60 ] ) , so the second term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ mmdot_cos_i ] ) will , in practice , go as @xmath198 . nevertheless , the general trend for @xmath107 and @xmath114 to be larger for smaller values of @xmath184 still holds .",
    "in fact , we find for these data that each term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ mmdot_cos_i ] ) is much larger than the left - hand side , so given the different effective scalings with @xmath184 of those two terms , the value of @xmath60 is quite sensitive to the assumed inclination .",
    "figure  [ kt_vs_mmdot_30_60 ] illustrates more concretely how much the feasible ranges of @xmath107 and @xmath114 depend on the choice of the observer inclination ; we show plots of @xmath105 versus @xmath60 for @xmath199 and @xmath200 for the 198990 data .",
    "if we take our minimum electron temperature limit seriously , then for @xmath148 , we find @xmath201  m@xmath1  and @xmath202  m@xmath3yr@xmath18 .",
    "by contrast , for @xmath200 , we find @xmath203m@xmath1  and @xmath204  m@xmath3yr@xmath18 . in the latter case ,",
    "an electron temperature of @xmath205  kev is implied for epoch  1 , which well exceeds our upper temperature limit . for the former case , although the electron temperatures fall within our adopted limits of 30  kev @xmath206 , the implied black hole mass is a factor of 30 smaller than the reverberation mapping estimate .",
    "therefore , as a compromise , we have taken @xmath207 as our nominal value which does yield a somewhat high electron temperature ( @xmath208  kev ) for epoch  1 , but also gives a mass upper limit ( @xmath209  m@xmath1 ) that is not in too great conflict with the reverberation mapping estimates ( see krolik 2001 ) .",
    "note that extraction of black hole spin energy , which we have not considered here , would ease the upper limits on the black hole mass by allowing , in principle , accretion efficiencies in excess of unity .    even assuming a mass as large as the reverberation mapping estimates , our fits to the optical / uv continua give @xmath210 .",
    "this is marginally inconsistent with the range of disk inner radii of @xmath211@xmath212 found by fitting a relativistically broadened iron line to the 1998 _ asca _  data ( chiang et al .",
    "2000 ; see also mushotzky et al .",
    "if @xmath213  m@xmath1 , then our results would be in serious disagreement with the detection of a relativistically broadened line .",
    "this conclusion relies on the 198990 epoch  1 data providing the relevant limits on @xmath60 .",
    "it is clear from figures  [ kt_vs_mmdot_ginga ] and  [ ginga_seds ] that the sed during this epoch was unusual , and the source may have been in a transient state for which the x - ray luminosity briefly exceeded the limit imposed by equation  ( [ global_energy_balance ] ) .",
    "averaging over the nine 198990 epochs , we obtain a much lower set of @xmath60-limits than we find from epoch  1 alone .",
    "these are indicated in figure  [ kt_vs_mmdot_ginga ] by the arrows along the top of the plot .",
    "we still require that @xmath214  m@xmath3yr@xmath18 in order to have reasonable electron temperatures for epochs  7 and  9 ; and so these averaged limits imply @xmath215",
    "m@xmath1 . if we take @xmath216  m@xmath1 , then @xmath217  m@xmath1  yr@xmath18 and @xmath218  erg  s@xmath18 . in this case , the x - ray luminosity exceeds the limit imposed by global energy balance for all observations except epoch  9 .",
    "if the comptonizing plasma is an adaf , then the radial velocity of the accretion flow in this region is @xmath219 , substantially higher than that of the surrounding thin disk ( narayan & yi 1995 ) . from mass conservation and our estimates of the accretion rate",
    ", we can determine a characteristic thomson depth , @xmath220 , for the central region .",
    "mass conservation in an accretion disk is given by @xmath221 where @xmath222 is the disk surface density , @xmath223 is the half - thickness , and we have set @xmath224 for the central region which we assume to be dominated by ions at the virial temperature .",
    "the density of the central region is roughly @xmath225 where @xmath226  cm@xmath103g@xmath18 is the electron scattering opacity . solving equations",
    "( [ mass_continuity ] ) and  ( [ adaf_density ] ) for the thomson depth and inserting nominal values , we obtain @xmath228 despite the crudeness of this estimate , it is encouraging that @xmath220 lies within the range of thomson depths yielded by our model ( tables  [ ginga_fits ] , [ rxte_fits ] , and  [ new_rxte_fits ] ) .",
    "a potentially serious problem for this model is the large change in thomson depth that we find between epochs  2.1 and  2.2 of the 1998 observations for both sets of response matrices ( tables  [ rxte_fits ] and  [ new_rxte_fits ] ) .",
    "since changes in @xmath36 must occur on time scales that are at least as long as the thermal time scale and since epochs 2.12.4 are fairly closely spaced over a 240  ks period ( chiang et al .",
    "2000 ; see also table  [ rxte_data ] ) , we must adopt a single radius for these epochs .",
    "for the 1999 response matrices and assuming @xmath229  cm , the thomson depth must change from @xmath230 to @xmath231 over @xmath232  ks . even for the 2002 response matrices ,",
    "the thomson depth must change from @xmath233 to @xmath234 , assuming @xmath138  cm .",
    "the necessity for these large changes can be readily understood . during these epochs ,",
    "the @xmath235  flux was essentially constant ( table  [ rxte_data ] ) .",
    "as we found for ngc  3516 , in order to have a nearly constant optical flux , the radius of the comptonizing region has to maintain an inverse relationship with the x - ray luminosity ( eq .  [ [ mmdot ] ] ) .",
    "since the x - ray spectral index increased over this interval , the radius @xmath10 also had to increase in order to produce a softer spectrum ; and therefore @xmath11 had to decrease . however , the 210  kev x - ray flux increased at the same time , and so the electron temperature had to decrease by a very large amount to compensate . for a fixed thomson depth , the electron temperature after the transition would result in an x - ray spectrum that would be much softer than is observed , and so the thomson depth had to change substantially as well .",
    "the time scale for the evolution of the thomson depth of the central region should be limited by either the thermal or accretion ( i.e. , viscous ) time scales . assuming a virial temperature for the ions in the central region , these two time scales are approximately the same , @xmath236  s ( eq .  [ [ t_th ] ] ) .",
    "one possible mitigating factor here is the relatively sparse coverage of the optical observations ( see  2 ) . multiplying the optical fluxes for epochs  2.12.4 in table  [ rxte_data ] by the factors 0.86 , 1.14 , 1.07 , and 0.98 , respectively , yields a nearly constant thomson depth of @xmath237 and electron temperatures @xmath238184  kev , assuming @xmath141  cm",
    "unfortunately , a @xmath239% change in the @xmath23  flux over the @xmath232  ks separating epochs 2.1 and 2.2 does not seem to be supported by the data ( dietrich et al .",
    "2001 , see their fig .  4 ) . of course , it is the uv photons produced near the innermost radius of the thin disk that are most important for determining the energy balance of the comptonizing plasma , and they may not be well correlated with the emission at longer wavelengths on these time scales .",
    "the disk flux at @xmath23  is produced at a characteristic radius of @xmath240^{4/3 } \\sim 3\\times 10^{15}$ ]  cm .",
    "therefore , the optical emission should be smeared out and delayed relative to the uv emission by @xmath241  s.",
    "we have fit simultaneous optical , uv , and x - ray data of ngc 5548 with reasonable success over a wide range of continuum flux levels using just a crude model consisting of a stationary , truncated accretion disk and a spherical hot inner plasma . under fairly general assumptions concerning accretion efficiency , energy balance , and self - consistency , we are able to place upper limits on the black hole mass , @xmath242  m@xmath1  and the accretion rate , @xmath243  m@xmath3yr@xmath4 . the upper limit on the black hole mass is less than that derived from reverberation mapping , which may itself be subject to some systematic uncertainty . increasing the accretion efficiency , perhaps by extracting black hole spin energy ,",
    "would relax our constraint on the black hole mass .",
    "we also find that the disk truncation radius is of order the size of the comptonizing plasma and is @xmath5@xmath244  cm .",
    "this is remarkably consistent with the size scale inferred in a completely different manner from the measured euv to x - ray time lags ( chiang et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "although the present model does not provide a perfect description of the multiwavelength variability of ngc 5548 , these calculations do show the potential for using multiwavelength data for constraining properties of the disk / black hole system in these objects .",
    "wider spectral coverage with more sensitive x - ray observatories will help enormously in testing models such as this .",
    "in particular , the ability to measure the thermal comptonization roll - over at energies @xmath245  kev will allow us to abandon our ad hoc temperature limits and the assumption of a global energy balance condition . forthcoming _ integral _  observations are the best near - term prospects for better measuring the thermal comptonization roll - over in seyfert 1 galaxies ; and some of the stronger sources  ngc 4151 , ic 4329a , and mcg@xmath2466 - 30 - 15  are among its highest priority targets .",
    "however , even _ integral _",
    "does not have the sensitivity to measure changes in the roll - over energy on the required time scales of @xmath232  ks .",

    "_ xmm - newton _  observations of ngc  5548 alone may be able to provide stringent tests of this model .",

    "combined with optical / uv spectroscopy available from the _ xmm - newton _  optical monitor that can determine @xmath36 directly , such observations should be able to constrain the black hole mass .",
    "however , if @xmath248 , as suggested by our analysis of the ngc 5548 data , then the iron line will not be relativistically broadened , and _ xmm - newton _  observations will provide at best a weak upper limit on @xmath107 .",
    "we wish to emphasize again that our model assumes that the disk itself is stationary , and all optical / uv variability is a result of the variable incident x - ray flux and varying @xmath36 . as we noted in equation ( [ t_th ] ) , the disk can be out of thermal equilibrium in the innermost regions on time scales comparable to the observed variations .",
    "if thermal instabilities are responsible for the variations in @xmath36 , then our model may not be fully consistent . even in the optically emitting regions ,",

    "is computed and a new scattering location is drawn .",
    "this continues until the photon escapes the comptonizing region .",
    "if the escaping photon intercepts the disk , then a separate compton reflection monte carlo is employed . in this calculation",
    ", the incident photon strikes a semi - infinite slab of material at the appropriate angle and is scattered by the cold electrons in the slab until it either re - emerges or is absorbed . for the material composing the slab ,",
    "we adopt the absorption cross - sections and abundances of bauciska - church & mccammon ( 1992 ) , and assume that the hydrogen and helium atoms are fully ionized and the remaining elements are neutral .",
    "this part of the code is functionally identical to the monte carlo calculations used by magdziarz & zdziarski ( 1995 ) to derive parameterizations of the compton reflection green functions .",
    "we have tested our code against their expressions and find consistent reflection spectra .",
    "photons that escape the comptonizing region without hitting the disk and those that emerge from the disk without re - entering the plasma are included in the final spectra according to their energy and direction .",
    "the thermal comptonization part of our monte carlo code has been checked against a two - dimensional iterative scattering ( is ) code in which the integrals for the source functions at each scattering order are computed numerically .",
    "this is code has in turn been checked against the one - dimensional is code of poutanen & svensson ( 1996 ) .",
    "we confirm that our monte carlo calculation agrees at each scattering order with the is code .",
    "using the monte carlo code rather than the is code presents several advantages .",
    "the principal one is that it runs more quickly than the is code , within a certain accuracy , allowing us to explore parameter space more efficiently .",
    "furthermore , interfacing it with the compton reflection part of the code is easier since both methods deal with individual photons .",
    "lastly , should we decide to generalize this calculation , it would be a straight - forward matter to modify the geometry of the comptonizing region or take into account curved spacetimes in computing the trajectories of the photons .    in order to find the equilibrium temperature of the comptonizing electrons , we proceeded iteratively , using the difference between the model and observed fluxes at a nominal wavelength ( in this case , @xmath23 ) as the main convergence criterion . for the calculation of an individual spectrum ,",
    "the radial thomson depth @xmath165 , the radius of the comptonizing region @xmath10 , the disk inner radius @xmath36 , the central black hole mass , the accretion rate , and initial estimates of the electron temperature and x - ray luminosity are taken from our semi - analytic calculations of  3 . for the first iteration , we assume a nominal value for the disk albedo , and we use the expressions from zdziarski et al .  ( 1999 ) , modified to include the contribution from local viscous dissipation , to determine the effective temperature as a function of disk radius . on subsequent iterations , the model and observed optical fluxes are compared , and the electron temperature ( and therefore the x - ray luminosity ) is adjusted .",
    "since we are computing the compton reflection spectrum in the disk at each iteration , we obtain the disk albedo as a function of radius which we use as input for the subsequent iteration .",
    "convergence has been achieved when both the model optical flux agrees with the observed value and the x - ray flux has converged to within a specified tolerance  typically 5% for each . as with our semi - analytic calculations , our monte carlo calculations do not consider pair balance or the presence of a non - thermal component in determining the properties of the comptonizing plasma .",
