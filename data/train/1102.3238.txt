    "the viscous properties of dilute dispersions of rigid rods change drastically as the rate of applied shear flows @xmath2 increases .",
    "although many previous studies have investigated this phenomenon , the mechanism of this viscosity change is not yet completely clear .",
    "the aim of this paper is to understand the detailed mechanism of the viscosity change by performing direct numerical simulations ( dns ) for a dilute dispersion of rigid rods that are subject to thermal fluctuations in a newtonian host fluid .",
    "the relationship between the measurable bulk rheological properties and the microscale description of dispersions of rod - like particles has been previously investigated in the literature @xcite .",
    "giesekus obtained the expression for the bulk stress tensor of diluted spheroidal dispersions under shear flow by taking into account the effects of the rotational brownian motion of the spheroids due to thermal fluctuations @xcite .",

    "the dilute rigid rod dispersions exhibit the 1st newtonian behavior , in which the viscosity @xmath7 of the dispersion is constant and equal to the 1st newtonian ( zero - shear limiting ) value @xmath8 . for an intermediate regime , @xmath9 , the dispersions exhibit shear - thinning behavior , in which @xmath10 . in the case of strong shear flow , @xmath11 ,",
    "the dispersions reenter the 2nd newtonian regime , in which @xmath7 becomes constant again and is equal to the 2nd newtonian ( high - shear limiting ) value @xmath12 .",
    "similar results have also been obtained in numerical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies . in this paper , the phrase _",
    "viscosity transition _ is used to express the changes in viscosity from the 1st newtonian to the shear - thinning behavior and also from the shear - thinning to the 2nd newtonian behavior .",
    "similar results have been observed for dilute dispersions of flexible chains , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "hinch and leal @xcite proposed a theoretical model for the viscosity transitions .",
    "they considered that the viscosity @xmath7 of the dispersion is determined by the ensemble average of the temporal viscosity @xmath13 using the probability distribution function ( pdf ) @xmath14 of the two orientational angles @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the rod , _ i.e. _ , @xmath17 here the form of @xmath14 is shear rate dependent , and the shear rate dependence of the dispersion viscosity @xmath18 is introduced mainly through this function .",
    "the rigid rod undergoes a random rotational brownian motion at low shear rates in the 1st newtonian regime , where the effect of thermal fluctuations is dominant over the effect of shear flow .",

    "however , the viscosity transition from the shear - thinning to the 2nd newtonian regime has never been successfully reproduced by numerical simulations .",
    "for rigid rod dispersions , we could not find any previous studies that have been performed at high enough shear rates to approach the 2nd newtonian regime .",
    "several numerical simulations have been conducted for flexible chain dispersions at high shear rates that are expected to be in the 2nd newtonian regime . however , the viscosity transition from shear - thinning to the 2nd newtonian behavior has never been correctly reproduced , not even when the hydrodynamic interactions are taken into account using the rotne - prager - yamakawa ( rpy ) tensor @xcite .    in the present study",
