    "resummation may be carried out in either @xmath0  @xcite or impact parameter ( @xmath1 ) space , which is the fourier conjugate of @xmath0 space .",
    "all else being equal , the @xmath1 space approach has the advantage that transverse momentum conservation is explicit . using renormalization group techniques , collins ,",
    "soper , and sterman ( css )  @xcite devised a @xmath1 space resummation formalism that resums all logarithmic terms as singular as @xmath52 when @xmath51 .",
    "this formalism has been used widely for computations of the transverse momentum distributions of vector bosons in hadron reactions  @xcite , higgs bosons  @xcite , and other processes  @xcite .    in many of these applications of the css formalism , two difficulties significantly limit its predictive power in the region of small and intermediate values of @xmath0 .",
    "the first of these is the ambiguity , if not discontinuity in @xmath0 , associated with the `` matching '' of the resummed and fixed - order calculations in a region of @xmath0 below which the resummed form is used , and above which a fixed - order expression is used .",
    "the second difficulty is associated with the quantitative importance of assumed forms for non - perturbative functions that , in many implementations , dominate the @xmath0 distribution in the region of very small @xmath0 and affect even the @xmath0 distribution at large @xmath0 . in recent papers",
    "@xcite , qiu and zhang demonstrate that both of these drawbacks can be overcome . by using an integral form for the oscillatory bessel function in the fourier transform ,",
    "they show that the @xmath1-space resummation procedure produces smooth distributions for all @xmath53 , obviating the need for a matching prescription .",
    "second , to substantially reduce the influence of phenomenological non - perturbative functions , they derive a new functional expression that extrapolates the perturbatively calculated @xmath1-space resummation expression from the region of small @xmath1 , where it is valid , to the region of large @xmath1 where non - perturbative input is needed .",
    "their analysis shows that perturbation theory itself indicates the form of the required non - perturbative power corrections .",
    "they also demonstrate that the predictive power of resummation improves considerably with total center - of - mass collision energy @xmath54 . in this paper",

    "we resum both leading and next - to - leading logarithmic terms associated with soft gluon emission to all orders in @xmath38 . at lhc energies ,",
    "the typical values of the incident parton momentum fractions @xmath55 ( for @xmath42  gev ) are small , and the gluon distribution evolves steeply at small @xmath56 .",
    "consequently , the saddle point in @xmath1 of the fourier transform from @xmath1-space to @xmath0 space is well into the region of perturbative validity .",
    "resummed perturbation theory is valid at small @xmath1 , just as perturbative qcd is valid at large @xmath0 .",
    "however , the fourier transform from @xmath1-space to @xmath0-space requires specification of the @xmath1-space distribution for all @xmath1 . in sec .",
    "iii , we show that the region of large @xmath1 becomes progressively less important quantitatively as @xmath54 increases .",
    "the @xmath0 distribution at lhc energies is entirely insensitive to the functional form we employ for the non - perturbative input at large @xmath1 , so long as the form used for this extrapolation does not modify the @xmath1-space distribution at small @xmath1 . in sec .",
    "iii.b , we discuss the extrapolation from the region of small @xmath1 to the region of large @xmath1 , and we specify the form we use for the non - perturbative functions at large @xmath1 . we discuss why other approaches in the literature may introduce inappropriate dependence on @xmath54 .",
    "we provide analytic expressions for the fixed - order perturbative subprocesses in sec .",
    "we employ expressions for the parton - level hard - scattering functions valid through first - order in @xmath38 , including contributions from the glue - glue , quark - glue , and quark - antiquark incident partonic subprocesses .",

    "our resummed results make a smooth transition to the fixed - order perturbative results near or just above @xmath61 , for all @xmath41 , without need of a supplementary matching procedure .",
    "our implementation of the resummation formalism works smoothly throughout the @xmath0 region even for the distributions differential in rapidity , @xmath2 .",
    "two points are evident in the comparison of @xmath7 boson and higgs boson production , with @xmath62 .",
    "the peak in the @xmath0 distribution occurs at a smaller value of @xmath0 for @xmath7 production ( 4.8  gev _ vs. _ 10  gev ) and the distribution is narrower for @xmath7 production .",
    "the larger qcd color factors produce more gluonic showering in the glue - glue scattering subprocess that dominates inclusive higgs boson production than in the fermionic subprocesses relevant for @xmath7 production .",
    "after all - orders resummation , the enhanced showering suppresses the large-@xmath1 ( small @xmath0 ) region more effectively for higgs boson production .",
    "we compare the predicted @xmath0 distributions for higgs boson production at different masses .",
    "the peak of the distribution shifts to greater @xmath0 as @xmath24 grows , in approximately linear fashion , and the distribution broadens somewhat .",
    "the mean value @xmath63 grows from about 35 gev at @xmath62 to about 54 gev at @xmath60 gev , and the root - mean - square grows from about 59  gev to about 87  gev . for @xmath7 production ,",
    "we find @xmath64  gev and @xmath65  gev .",
    "the harder @xmath0 spectrum suggests that the signal to background ratio can be enhanced if higgs bosons are selected with large @xmath0 .",
    "choices of variable parameters are made in obtaining our results , and we examine the sensitivity of the results to these choices , including the renormalization / factorization scale @xmath66 and the non - perturbative input .",
    "scale dependence is the most important source of uncertainty .",
    "it can shift the position of the peak by about 1  gev , with corresponding changes in the normalization of the distribution above and below the position of the peak .",
    "the value of @xmath67 at the peak position is shifted by 4 to 5% .",
    "changes in the parameters of the non - perturbative input produce effects that at most 1 to 2% depending on the size of the power corrections we introduce . in the formulation we use to describe the non - perturbative region",
    ", there is essentially no effect on the behavior of differential cross section at large @xmath0 . in comparison with prior work",
    ", we note that the locations of the maxima in the distributions @xmath67 occur at slightly larger values of @xmath0 in our case , and the distributions themselves differ as a function of @xmath0 above the location of the maximum .",
    "the differences arise from the different treatment of the non - perturbative input . in our approach , the assumed parametrization of non - perturbative effects has the desirable property that it does not affect the physics in the perturbative region @xmath68  gev .",
