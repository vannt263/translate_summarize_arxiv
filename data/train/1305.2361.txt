    "the optical kerr effect refers to the intensity - dependent phase shift that a light field experiences during its propagation through a third - order nonlinear medium .",
    "this leads to a remarkable non - gaussian operation that has sparked considerable interest due to potential applications in a variety of areas , such as quantum nondemolition measurements  @xcite , generation of quantum superpositions  @xcite , quantum teleportation  @xcite , quantum logic  @xcite , and single - particle detectors  @xcite , to cite only a few .",
    "enhanced kerr nonlinearities have been observed in electromagnetically - induced transparency  @xcite , bose - einstein condensates  @xcite , cold atoms  @xcite and josephson junctions  @xcite .",
    "additional arrangements involve the purcell effect  @xcite , rydberg atoms  @xcite , light - induced stark shifts  @xcite , and nanomechanical resonators  @xcite .",
    "special mention must be made of the role that this cubic nonlinearity has played in the generation of squeezed light .",
    "the first proposals employed schemes involving a nonlinear interferometer  @xcite or degenerate four - wave mixing  @xcite . but quite soon optical fibers became the paradigm for that purpose  @xcite . however ,",
    "due to the typically small values of the nonlinearity in silica glass  @xcite , kerr - based fibers need long propagation distances and high powers , which bring other unwanted effects  @xcite .    in this paper , we direct out attention to this limit of high intensities , in which one could expect a classical description to be pertinent . under reasonable assumptions , maxwell s equations lead to a set of coupled nonlinear schrdinger equations that has long been a useful tool for depicting the behavior of optical fields in nonlinear dispersive media .",
    "it has proved valuable in the description of such diverse phenomena as pulse compression , dark soliton formation , and self - focusing of ultrashort pulses  @xcite .",
    "yet there remain nonclassical features that can not be explained in this classical manner . to put it differently , at the most basic level ,",
    "the propagation of light in a kerr medium is accompanied by unavoidable quantum effects .",
    "the considerations thus far indicate that the regime we wish to explore can be regarded as a problem at the boundary between classical and quantum worlds .",
    "probably , the transition between both can be best scrutinized by exploiting phase - space methods  @xcite .",
    "this opens up the possibility of gaining some information about the nonclassical behavior with a quasiclassical description that employs essentially classical trajectories , while the correct quantum initial state is taken into account via , e.g. , the wigner function  @xcite .",
    "despite some problems with the interpretation , the wigner function has enjoyed substantial attention in various domains of physics  @xcite and has already been applied to some nonlinear problems in quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "the intensity dependence of the refractive index , which is the hallmark of the kerr effect , can manifest itself in two different ways : as a self - phase modulation and as a cross - phase modulation .",
    "self - phase modulation refers to the self - induced phase shift experienced by an optical field during its propagation , whereas cross - phase modulation refers to the nonlinear phase shift of an optical field induced by another one having a different wavelength , direction , or state of polarization .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the cross - kerr effect , for it is especially germane to attain polarization squeezing , a major goal in our laboratory  @xcite .",
    "we capitalize on the quasiclassical approach to re - analyze the light propagation in this case in a very concise way : after neglecting higher - order fluctuations , we get an evolution equation for the wigner function that can be integrated to an analytical form . this allows us to study the dynamics of mode correlations . since the resulting state in non - gaussian , the application of common entanglement criteria  @xcite becomes problematic , so we content ourselves with the study of the purity of the reduced states , which can be carried out in a closed form .",
    "the two - mode wigner function is appropriately cast in poincar space in terms of the phase - space version of the stokes parameters , which affords an intuitive picture .",
    "finally , as the kerr dynamics is photon - number preserving , the standard models of dissipation  @xcite based in coupling the modes to lossy reservoirs , seem inadequate .",
    "instead , we allow for dissipation through pure dephasing processes which turns out to be exactly solvable .",
    "the resulting evolution reveals that the shape of the wigner functions is not considerably modified , but their size is shrunk .",
    "as heralded in the introduction , the cross - kerr configuration corresponds to a situation in which the refractive index of a beam ( say @xmath0 ) is modified by the intensity of a second one ( say @xmath1 ) .",
    "these beams are excited in two orthogonal polarization modes that , in a quantum description , are characterized by two complex amplitude operators , denoted @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "these operators obey the standard bosonic commutation relations @xmath4",

    "the hamiltonian accounting for the cross - kerr interaction is  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an effective coupling constant that depends on the third - order nonlinear susceptibility . for any state described by the density operator @xmath8",

    "it is apparent that equation ( [ eq : evolexacohst ] ) is of practical use only for few - photon states .",
    "actually , such an exact solution does not facilitate to extract the classical part of the dynamics in a manifest form . to that end , we proceed to decompose the mode operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 as @xmath17 that is , a sum of classical amplitudes and quantum noise operators .",
    "the average values of the noise operators are assumed to be much smaller than the corresponding coherent amplitudes ( @xmath18 ) , so we can restrict the analysis to first - order terms in @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "if we employ the two - mode wigner function @xmath21 and the basic techniques outlined in  [ ap : wigner ] , equation  ( [ eq : solevol ] ) , with this linearization _ ansatz _ , can be recast as @xmath22 two comments are in order here .",
    "first , we are ignoring quantum fluctuations , inasmuch we are disregarding higher - order moments of the noise operators ; this seems a plausible approximation for highly - excited fields .",
    "second , we underline that the evolution is specified only by classical trajectories , much in the spirit of the quasiclassical approximation .    to shed light on the physics embodied in  ( [ eq : wapprox ] ) ,",
    "we resort to action - angle variables @xmath23 for each mode  @xcite . in our context , they can be defined as @xmath24 therefore @xmath25 is the polar angle in phase space , whereas @xmath26 is related to the mode intensity ( see figure  [ fig : squeezing ] ) . with these variables ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : wapprox ] ) can be rewritten in a simple and elegant form @xmath27 as @xmath28 generates rotations in phase space , equation  ( [ eq : w_p ] ) reflects that the amplitudes in each mode experience different rotations , with angles proportional to the intensity components of the other mode  @xcite .",
    "the result is schematized in figure  [ fig : squeezing ] : roughly speaking , the shaded area indicates the region in phase space occupied by the state . for an initial coherent state",
    "this area is a circle ; the top of the circle corresponds to higher intensity and therefore is more phase shifted than the bottom , resulting in an elliptical noise distribution .     schematic representation , in the phase space of a single mode , of the effect of a kerr medium .",
    "the initial state is a coherent state , represented by a circle noise determined by the uncertainty relation .",
    "it experiences a rotation of angle depending on the different amplitudes @xmath29 .",
    "the final result is an elliptical noise distribution.,height=188 ]    equation  ( [ eq : w_p ] ) can be readily solved : @xmath30 if again we assume initially the two - mode coherent state @xmath31 ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) and using ( [ eq : wcoh ] ) , equation  ( [ eq : wigner - t ] ) reduces to @xmath34     \\nonumber \\\\    & \\times &    \\exp \\left [ - 2 | \\sqrt{\\mathcal{i}_{b } } e^{i ( \\varphi_{b }         + 2 \\mathcal{i}_{a } \\tau ) }   - \\sqrt{\\mathcal{i}_{0b } }      e^{i\\varphi_{0b}}|^{2 } \\right ] \\ ,   ,    \\label{wt_0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced the dimensionless variable @xmath35 .",
    "observe that at @xmath36 the wigner function is made of two independent gaussians , while as time goes by the induced mode correlations lead to a non - gaussian state .",
    "two - mode gaussian states constitute the simplest example of a continuous - variable bipartite system , the workhorses of quantum information .",
    "accordingly , the theoretical aspects of these states have been extensively worked out and a variety of quantitative characterizations are available for them  @xcite .",
    "the unique feature of these gaussian states is that they are fully specified ( up to local displacements ) by the covariance matrix @xmath37 , with elements @xmath38 $ ] , where @xmath39 denotes the anticommutator and @xmath40 is the vector of phase - space operators .",
    "this covariance matrix can be jotted down as @xmath41 here , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the covariance matrices associated to the reduced state of the modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , while @xmath44 describes the correlation between these modes .",

    "these symplectic eigenvalues encode all the essential information and provide powerful , simple ways to express fundamental properties .",
    "for example , a gaussian state is entangled if and only if @xmath47 where the smallest symplectic eigenvalue @xmath48 of the covariance matrix corresponding to the partially transposed state is obtained from @xmath49 by replacing @xmath50 with @xmath51 ; i.e. , by time reversal in the second system and thus a flip of its canonical momentum .    in figure",
    "[ fig : symeig ] we have plotted the time evolution of @xmath48 for the state ( [ wt_0 ] ) , showing a rapid increase ( in the inset , we observe a fluctuating behavior that is smeared out in a larger scale ) .",
    "the main caveat with this approach is that , as mentioned before , our state rapidly becomes non - gaussian , and criterion ( [ eq : symeig ] ) gives then only a sufficient condition .",
    "consequently , we can certify entanglement just in the short - time window displayed in the inset .",
    "this actually holds for any available criterion  @xcite : if the state is entangled , a given test may or not detect its entanglement ; in turn , if a particular test does not detect entanglement , we can not conclude separability of the state .",
    "genuine non - gaussian entanglement can only be revealed by measures involving higher - order moments . in this vein ,",
    "shchukin and vogel  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) have introduced a general hierarchy of necessary and sufficient conditions for any state to be entangled .",
    "nevertheless , the application of this technique to our problem turns out to be very arduous for it involves checking non - trivial inequalities , which can be performed only numerically .",
    "moreover , the method involves the determination of moments that are extremely oscillatory and noisy  @xcite .",
    "time evolution of the symplectic eigenvalue @xmath48 of the state ( [ wt_0 ] ) , as a measure for the entanglement between the two modes .",
    "we have taken both modes with the same intensity @xmath52 .",
    "entanglement is proven for @xmath53 , a region which can be observed only in the inset.,height=245 ]    in view of these difficulties , we content ourselves with assessing the purity of the reduced state of both modes .",
    "this is related to the linear entropy and intimately connected to the intermodal correlations  @xcite .",
    "these local purities are @xmath54 \\ , ,     \\qquad    p_{b } ( \\tau ) = \\tr_{b } [ { \\hat{\\varrho}}_{b}^{2 } ( \\tau ) ] \\ , , \\ ] ] @xmath55 $ ] and @xmath56 $ ] being the reduced density matrices of modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . if we employ now the two - mode wigner function ( [ wt_0 ] ) , the purity , say @xmath57 , can be written as @xmath58^{2 } \\ , .\\ ] ]    for a bipartite system , both purities in ( [ eq : defpur ] ) coincide for pure states  @xcite . in general , these quantities are different for mixed states . in our case , after a long but otherwise straightforward calculation ( which , for completeness , is sketched in [ ap : purity - reduc - dens ] ) , @xmath57 can be displayed as @xmath59 where @xmath60 are the modified bessel functions of first kind and the last equality has been carefully checked by numerical experiments .",
    "this surprising symmetry can be ascribed to the way in which the modes enter the kerr hamiltonian  ( [ eq : exacthamiltonian ] ) .",
    "accordingly , we drop the mode subscripts in the purities .    as we are dealing with highly - excited fields ( @xmath61 ) , we can make use of the asymptotic expansion  @xcite @xmath62 ) do not oscillate , we can replace the summation by an integral ; the final result being @xmath63     evolution of the purity @xmath64 as a measure for the correlations between the two modes for the same conditions as in figure  2.,height=245 ]    in figure  [ fig : purity ] we plot the time evolution of this @xmath65 in the same scale as in figure  [ fig : symeig ] . at @xmath66",
    "the reduced purity is unity , in agreement with the fact that initially the state consists of two uncorrelated gaussians .",
    "as time evolves , the purity smoothly decreases ( much in a similar way as the symplectic eigenvalue @xmath48 decreases ) , which indicates the presence of mode correlations .",
    "this is supported by the following asymptotic estimate of ( [ eq : sumbyint ] ) @xmath67 valid for @xmath68 .",
    "it is clear that this form of @xmath64 is invariant under mode permutations .",
    "finally , @xmath65 tends to its stationary value .",
    "one might wonder how quantum fluctuations , neglected thus far , could modify this quasiclassical picture .",
    "for the particular case of initial coherent states we are treating here , we can analytically compute the purity for the exact quantum solution .",
    "indeed , from ( [ eq : evolexacohst ] ) we have @xmath69 \\sum_{n_{a } ,      n_{b}=0}^\\infty     \\frac{\\alpha_{0}^{n_{a } } \\alpha_{0}^{\\ast n_{b } } }    { \\sqrt{n_{a } ! \\ ,   n_{b } ! } } \\ ,     \\exp \\left [ e^{2i\\tau ( n_{a } - n_{b } ) } |\\beta_{0}|^2 \\right ]     | n_{a } \\rangle \\langle n_{b}| \\ , , \\ ] ] wherefrom one easily derive the exact expression for the purity : @xmath70 \\ , .\\ ] ] using the properties of the bessel functions , we redraft this as @xmath71 which explicitly exhibits the aforementioned symmetry .",
    "in fact , taking into account ( [ eq : besseli ] ) , @xmath72 appears as a bidimensional jacobi theta function  @xcite , which is periodic .",
    "however , in the time scales we are considering here , such a periodicity is unnoticeable and we can replace again the sum by an integral , getting precisely equation  ( [ eq : lim ] ) .    in the inset of figure  [ fig : purity ] we have plotted the difference between the exact solution ( [ eq : exactreducedpurity2 ] ) and the quasiclassical one ( [ eq : sumbyint ] ) . as we can see , both solutions coincide for any practical purpose .",
    "this means that the correlations examined before are of quantum nature , but higher - order correlations play no relevant role here .",
    "since the polarization modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 have the same frequency and are orthogonal , their superposition results in a general elliptical polarization .",
    "this means that one needs only three independent quantities : the amplitudes of each mode and the relative phase between them . to describe this at the quantum level , it is advantageous to use the stokes operators  @xcite @xmath73 complemented with the total number @xmath74 . on account of ( [ eq : abcr ] )",
    ", the operators ( [ gensu2 ] ) satisfy the commutation relations of an angular momentum @xmath75 = 2 i \\varepsilon_{k\\ell m } \\ ,    { \\hat{s}}_{m }   \\ , , \\qquad [ { \\hat{n } } , { \\hat{s}}_{k } ] = 0 \\ , , \\ ] ] where the latin indices run over @xmath76 and @xmath77 is the levi - civita fully antisymmetric tensor .",
    "this noncommutability precludes the simultaneous exact measurement of the physical quantities they represent and leads immediately to the heisenberg inequalities  @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 indicates the variance .",
    "it is always possible to find pairs of maximally conjugate operators for this uncertainty relation .",
    "this is equivalent to establishing a basis in which only one of the operators ( [ gensu2 ] ) has a nonzero expectation value , say and @xmath80 .",
    "the only nontrivial heisenberg inequality reads thus @xmath81    polarization squeezing can then be sensibly defined by the condition  @xcite @xmath82 note that squeezed states according to ( [ eq : polsq1 ] ) are not , in general , minimum uncertainty states .",
    "the choice of the conjugate operators @xmath83 is by no means unique : there exists an infinite set @xmath84 that are perpendicular to the classical excitation @xmath85 , for which @xmath86 for all @xmath87 .",
    "all these pairs exist in the @xmath88@xmath89 plane , which is called the _",
    "dark plane_. a generic @xmath90 can be written as @xmath91 @xmath87 being an angle defined relative to @xmath92 .",
    "condition ( [ eq : polsq1 ] ) is then equivalent to @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the maximally squeezed operator and @xmath95 the antisqueezed one .",
    "in many experiments both modes have the same amplitude but are phase shifted by @xmath96 : @xmath97 .",
    "this light is circularly polarized and fulfills @xmath98 , @xmath99 , so ( [ eq : polsq2 ] ) directly applies .    the time evolution of the variables involved in those definitions can be evaluated using the wigner - distribution approach : @xmath100 \\ , .\\ ] ] here , @xmath101 refers to the phase - space function corresponding to the operator @xmath102 ( commonly called its symbol ) . from ( [ gensu2 ] ) and ( [ eq : sdark ] )",

    "usually , decoherence is accompanied by dissipation , i.e. , a net exchange of energy with the environment . however , giving the nature of the kerr nonlinearity , we are interested in the case of pure decoherence ( also known as dephasing ) , for which the processes of energy dissipation are negligible",
