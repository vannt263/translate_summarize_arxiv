    "the choice of a basis set which may first appear as  the black art \" @xcite is being constantly debated within the quantum chemistry community .",
    "it is well known that in molecular calculations there are two main groups of molecular basis sets introduced by pople and collaborators ( see @xcite and references therein ) and more recently by dunning @xcite .",
    "both groups supply us with the whole hierarchy of basis sets , where at each step we can enrich the main set by polarization functions of high orbital type or by diffuse functions .",
    "for example , one has to add polarization functions if polarization effects are expected to be important , or diffuse functions if we want to refine the description of extended molecular states . not surprisingly , the actual choice of a basis set depends on the task to be solved and is considered as a difficult problem . for heavy and laborous calculations the choice of a basis set is crucial since on one hand we want to obtain a reliable result and on the other hand minimize the computer time to achieve the goal .",
    "in contrast to this complicated hierarchy of molecular basis sets , the choice of bases in electronic band structure calculations and here we imply mainly the linear augmented plane wave ( lapw ) method @xcite , seems rather simple . the number of augmented plane waves is commonly determined by the parameter @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the smallest muffin - tin ( mt ) radius , and @xmath3 is the maximal value of the plane wave vector .",
    "the @xmath3 value implies that the kinetic energy cut off is @xmath4 ( in atomic units ) .",
    "however , in practice some band structure calculations can not be carried out without so called local orbitals ( lo ) @xcite .",
    "such situations occur in systems with semicore electron states which can not be fully confined within the mt - spheres .",
    "the problem of extended core states and its relation to our approach is discussed in detail in the next section .",
    "what concerns us here is that the introduction of local orbitals represents an extension of the canonical lapw basis set albeit the form of new basis states ( local orbitals ) is very different from the standard augmented plane wave basis function .",
    "the lapw+lo scheme proposed by singh @xcite , @xcite is practical , but the way it has been introduced is not fully satisfactory .",
    "the form of the local orbital functions is not derived from a general approach , and arguments for adding lo basis states are purely variational .    in the present paper",
    "we show that the appearance of supplemented basis functions can be understood as a result of refinement of the lapw band scheme when in an effort to increase its accuracy we use two linearization energies ( corresponding to two electron bands ) .",
    "we will demonstrate that new basis states are of two types .",
    "the first group gives the local orbitals in the form suggested by sing @xcite .",
    "however , the basis functions of second type have different form which is not used in the lapw+lo method .",
    "therefore , the canonical lapw basis set and also the lapw+lo basis set can be extended to a more complete basis set .",
    "new basis functions and consequences of their introduction are closely examined in the present work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with revisiting the problem of extended core states which gives rise to the lapw+lo scheme and formulate our initial statement for the refinement of the lapw method , sec .",
    "[ semi ] . in sec .",
    "[ meth ] we present our method which results in adding tight binding basis functions to the canonical lapw basis set . in sec .",
    "[ app ] we apply the method to electron band structure calculations of the face centered and body centered lattice of lanthanum and the hexagonal close packed lattice of cadmium . our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "the linear augmented plane wave ( lapw ) method @xcite is probably the most precise method for electronic band structure calculations and is widely used for the calculation of materials properties @xcite .    in the lapw method",
    "@xcite space is partitioned in the region inside the nonoverlapping muffin - tin ( @xmath5 ) spheres and the interstitial region @xmath6 .",
    "the basis functions @xmath7 where @xmath8 are given by @xmath9 with radial parts @xmath10 here the index @xmath11 refers to the type of atom ( or @xmath5-sphere ) in the unit cell , the radius @xmath12 is counted from the center @xmath13 of the sphere @xmath11 ( i.e. @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 is the volume of the unit cell .",
    "radial functions @xmath16 are solutions of the schrdinger equation in the spherically averaged crystal potential computed at the linearization energy @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the derivative of @xmath19 with respect to @xmath20 at @xmath17 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath22 are found from the condition that the basis function @xmath23 is continuous with continuous derivative at the sphere boundary , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is the radius of the @xmath5-sphere @xmath11 ) . in the following for compactness",
    "we omit the index @xmath11 and restore it when needed .",
    "linearization energies @xmath17 are chosen close to average values of corresponding band energies or to the fermi level .",
    "the extended electron basis states defined by eq .",
    "( [ i1 ] ) as a rule are orthogonal to the core states .",
    "this is a consequence of the relation @xmath26 applied to a core state with orbital quantum numbers @xmath27 and the radial wave function @xmath28 , and a partial radial function of valence state , @xmath29 , eq .",
    "( [ i1a ] ) , with the same angular dependence .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "( [ i2 ] ) ensures the orthogonality between the extended and core states if two conditions at the sphere boundary are satisfied for each of the core states ,    @xmath30    although these conditions are met for a great number of cases , they are violated for so called semicore states that are not fully contained in the muffin - tin sphere @xcite .",
    "semicore states leaking out of the @xmath5-regions should be treated as extended states .",
    "this in turn requires that the linearization energy @xmath17 is chosen near the energy of the semicore level , @xmath31 , because the lapw basis describes only states near @xmath17 well .",
    "however , as @xmath32 is quite far from the fermi energy @xmath33 and the valence band energy , the choice @xmath34 inevitably gives poor description for partial @xmath35 valence states . on the other hand , the option @xmath36 is not satisfactory for the semicore states situated substantially deeper in energy . as discussed in refs.@xcite",
    "there is no simple solution to this dilemma .",
    "even worse , in many cases the attempt to use a single value of @xmath17 for both valence and semicore states leads to the appearance of so called  ghost bands \" @xcite giving false band energy positions . as a remedy one can divide the energy spectrum in two windows ( energy panels ) and use two different sets of @xmath17 for calculations of semicore and valence states , respectively",
    "this technique however is also not fully satisfactory because now there is no single hamiltonian matrix for the problem and strict orthogonality between electron states belonging to different energy windows is not guaranteed .",
    "ideally , in the mt - region there should be two different types of radial components with the same angular dependence @xmath35 .",
    "that is , in eq .",
    "( [ i1 ] )    @xmath37    where @xmath38 refers to the semicore states with @xmath39 , and @xmath40 refers to the valence states with @xmath41 .",
    "both states , eqs .",
    "( [ i4a ] ) and ( [ i4b ] ) , should merge to a single @xmath42wave component of the plane wave @xmath43    at the surface of mt sphere .",
    "now , however the boundary problem becomes ill - defined , because for the @xmath35 component there are four coefficients , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 for only two boundary conditions .    in ref .",
    "@xcite singh has proposed to increase the number of boundary conditions to four by matching the value of the basis function and its first three radial derivatives at the sphere surface .",
    "this gives rise to super - linearized apw method denoted as slapw-4 @xcite because four functions , four coefficients and four boundary conditions are involved . in a simpler super - linearized modification called slapw-3 @xcite the first radial part @xmath48 , eq .",
    "( [ i4a ] ) , is supplemented by only one function @xmath49 ( instead of @xmath50 , eq .",
    "( [ i4b ] ) ) .",
    "the three coefficients ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) are determined by requiring continuity of the basis function and its two derivatives .    in comparison with standard lapw method in both slapw modifications",
    "there are additional requirements for the plane wave convergence .",
    "indeed , the plane wave expansion of the interstitial region must converge either to the correct second and third derivative ( slapw-4 ) or to the second derivative ( slapw-3 ) .",
    "because of that more plane waves are needed to satisfy these additional requirements , the plane wave energy cutoff parameter should be increased and calculations become much more costly @xcite,@xcite .    to circumvent the problem and improve the lapw efficiency singh put forward a third approach based on local orbitals ( lapw+lo ) @xcite . in the lapw+lo approach the same three radial functions as in slapw-3 are used ( i.e. @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath49 ) , but the coefficient of @xmath49 is fixed ( say , @xmath53 ) and the two remaining coefficients ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) are found from the conditions that the local orbital goes to zero with zero derivative at the sphere boundary .",
    "nowadays , lapw+lo is widely used for band structure calculations of solids with semicore states @xcite .",
    "however , conceptually the lapw+lo method is understood as a procedure giving additional variational freedom through an increase of the number of basis functions .",
    "it is not clear why additional basis functions should include these particular components ( i.e. @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath49 ) .",
    "the proposed zero boundary conditions for local functions are not derived from a general physical statement .",
    "inspired by the lapw+lo method @xcite in the present study we formulate a more general approach to the problem . unlike the lapw+lo approach which uses variational arguments for its foundation , we will derive supplemented basis states from the initial requirement that two different radial functions ( i.e. @xmath48 and @xmath50 , eqs.([i4a ] ) , ( [ i4b ] ) ) , having the same angular part merge in a single plane wave function @xmath23 , eq .",
    "( [ i4c ] ) , in the interstitial region .",
    "unlike slapw-4 or slapw-3 we retain only two joining conditions across the @xmath5-sphere boundary . as a result ,",
    "we will obtain two types of supplementary tight - binding basis functions ( see eqs .",
    "( [ m10b ] ) and ( [ m10c ] ) below ) , satisfying bloch s theorem .",
    "as discussed in sec .  [ semi ] , in the case of semicore states we have two types of radial solutions in the mt - region with the same angular dependence @xmath54 but different linearization energies @xmath55 and @xmath56 : @xmath57 , eq .  ( [ i4a ] ) , and @xmath58 , eq .",
    "( [ i4b ] ) .",
    "one of the radial functions can refer to extended states , i.e. @xmath59 , while the other can refer to supplementary angular states @xmath60 . as we will see later in sec .",
    "[ app ] in practice we describe the semicore states as extended states with @xmath61 and valence states with the same @xmath62 as supplementary states for which @xmath63 .",
    "( for metals one can take @xmath64 . )",
    "since in the interstitial @xmath6-region both types of solutions are represented by the plane wave function @xmath7 , eq .",
    "( [ i4c ] ) , they become indistinguishable there . in the lapw method",
    "there are two matching conditions ( for the function and its derivative ) on the sphere boundary .",
    "therefore , in our case we have    @xmath65    here we adopt short notations @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and have used the rayleigh expansion of the plane wave @xmath23 on the sphere surface .",

    "<S> in order to increase the accuracy of the linearized augmented plane wave method ( lapw ) we present a new approach where the plane wave basis function is augmented by two different atomic radial components constructed at two different linearization energies corresponding to two different electron bands ( or energy windows ) . we demonstrate that this case can be reduced to the standard treatment within the lapw paradigm where the usual basis set is enriched by the basis functions of the tight binding type , which go to zero with zero derivative at the sphere boundary . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the task is closely related with the problem of extended core states which is currently solved by applying the lapw method with local orbitals ( lapw+lo ) . in comparison with lapw+lo , </S>",
    "<S> the number of supplemented basis functions in our approach is doubled , which opens up a new channel for the extension of the lapw and lapw+lo basis sets . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of new supplemented basis functions absent in the lapw+lo treatment is closely related with the existence of the @xmath0component in the canonical lapw method . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss properties of additional tight binding basis functions and apply the extended basis set for computation of electron energy bands of lanthanum ( face and body centered structures ) and hexagonal close packed lattice of cadmium . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the new treatment gives lower total energies in comparison with both canonical lapw and lapw+lo , with the energy difference more pronounced for intermediate and poor lapw basis sets . </S>"
