    "the of existence of a quasiconformal mapping @xmath2 with a given complex dilatation @xmath1 is one of the central problems of classical complex analysis .",
    "we will first recall a definition of a quasiconformal map .",
    "given an open set @xmath3 , a map @xmath4 is said to be absolutely continuous on lines ( acl ) in a rectangle @xmath5 with sides parallel to the @xmath6 and @xmath7 axes if @xmath8 is absolutely continuous on almost every horizontal and vertical line in @xmath9 .",

    "partial derivatives @xmath11 and @xmath12 of such map exist a.e . in @xmath10 .",
    "a homeomorphism @xmath13 is k - quasiconformal if and only if the following holds :    * @xmath8 is acl on every rectangle in @xmath10 , * @xmath14 a.e . in @xmath10 .",
    "the complex dilatation of a quasiconformal homeomorphism @xmath8 defined a.e . is @xmath15    a mapping @xmath8 with a prescribed complex dilatation @xmath1 solves the following _ beltrami equation _ :",
    "@xmath16    the question of existence of a solution of @xmath17 is addressed in the famous ahlfors  bers  boyarskii theorem ( see @xcite and @xcite ) :    [ abb](ahlfors and bers , boyarskii ) .",
    "let @xmath18 satisfy @xmath19 .",
    "then there exists a unique map @xmath20 such that @xmath21 satisfies the beltrami equation @xmath22 , @xmath21 fixes @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and @xmath21 is a @xmath26-quasiconformal map .    according to the classical proof of this theorem ,",
    "a solution of the beltrami equation can be constructed with the help of two operators : the first operator being the hilbert transform @xmath27(z)={i \\over 2 \\pi } \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0 } \\int \\int_{{\\mathbb{c } } \\setminus b(z,\\epsilon ) } { h(\\xi ) \\over ( \\xi -z)^2 } \\ d",

    "then the quasiconformal homeomorphism @xmath8 is constructed in two steps .",
    "first , one solves the following equation : @xmath29+t[\\mu].\\ ] ]    if @xmath30 satisfying ( [ eq : h = tmuh+th ] ) is found , then @xmath8 solving ( [ belt_eqn ] ) is given by @xmath31(z)+z.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the operator @xmath32 is well - defined and is hlder continuous for @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "this implies that a solution to ( [ eq : h = tmuh+th ] ) must also be constructed in @xmath35 , @xmath34 . the celebrated calderon ",

    "we can now state the extended version of the ahlfors  bers  boyarskii theorem for compactly supported differentials :    [ compactabb ] let @xmath51 be compactly supported and satisfy @xmath19 .",
    "then for every @xmath34 such that @xmath52 , the operator @xmath53 $ ] is a contraction on @xmath35 with a unique fixed point @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , the solution of the beltrami equation , @xmath21 , is given by @xmath54 + id,\\ ] ] and is such that @xmath55 , @xmath8 is continuous , has distributional derivatives , and @xmath56 .",
    "we will concentrate on the numerical implementation of the procedure described in this theorem .",
    "this is an important practical problem which has been addressed by various authors .",
    "efficient algorithms for computing the two required transforms @xmath43 and @xmath32 have been proposed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we will proceed with a very brief description of these algorithms .    as we have pointed out ,",
    "the cauchy transform of an @xmath57-function , @xmath58 , is well - defined and is known to be hlder continuous with exponent @xmath59 ( cf @xcite , @xcite ) . in @xcite an effective algorithm for the numerical computation of the following integral transform was suggested : @xmath60 ( z)={i \\over 2 \\pi } \\int \\int_{{\\mathbb{c } } } { h(\\xi ) \\over ( \\xi -z ) } \\ d \\bar{\\xi } \\wedge d \\xi.\\ ] ]    a comparison with ( [ cauchy_tran ] ) immediately shows that , @xmath61(z)&=&\\p [ h ] ( z)-\\p [ h ] ( 0).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    represent @xmath62 and @xmath63 $ ] as a fourier series : @xmath64(r e^{i \\theta})&=&\\sum^{\\infty}_{k=-\\infty } p_k(r ) e^{i k \\theta},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coefficients of the @xmath65-transform are given by @xmath66(r e^{i \\theta } ) \\ d \\theta,\\ ] ] then , according to @xcite , @xmath67    next , to obtain similar formulae for the hilbert transform , assume that @xmath62 is a hlder continuous function compactly supported in an open disk around zero of radius @xmath9 , @xmath68 .",
    "the hilbert transform of such function is well - defined ( see next section ) .",
    "represent the hilbert transform as a fourier series @xmath69(r e^{i \\theta})&=&\\sum^{\\infty}_{k=-\\infty } c_k(r ) e^{i k \\theta } , \\quad c_k(r)= { 1 \\over 2 \\pi } \\int^{2 \\pi}_0 e^{-i k \\theta } t[h](r e^{i \\theta } ) \\ d \\theta . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in @xcite and @xcite the authors arrive at the following expressions for these coefficients : @xmath70 where @xmath71    given values of @xmath62 , for instance , on a circular @xmath72 grid that contains the compact support of @xmath62 , one can use a fast fourier transform ( fft , cf @xcite ) to find the values of the coefficients @xmath73 at the radii @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "next , one can use these values to construct a piecewise constant , a piecewise linear or a spline approximation of the functions @xmath73 ( the choice of approximation , of course , depends on the known or expected smoothness of @xmath73 ) .",
    "this allows one to compute integrals in ( [ cauchy_alg ] ) and in ( [ hilbert_alg_1])([hilbert_alg_2 ] ) .",
    "armed with these implementations of the hilbert and cauchy transforms , one can try to solve the beltrami equation ( [ belt_eqn ] ) , first by running iterations ( [ hilbert_iter ] ) for some time , and , finally , applying ( [ solution ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to use the point - wise multiplication of grid values of @xmath62 and @xmath76 inside the hilbert transform in ( [ hilbert_iter ] ) , rather than the multiplication of their fourier series : the order of the computational complexity of the point - wise multiplication is @xmath77 , as opposed to @xmath78 for the series .",
    "the transition from the representation of @xmath62 as a fourier series to point values at each iteration step can be performed with the help of the fft .",
    "this way , the computational complexity of one iteration step becomes @xmath79 .",
    "the objective of our paper will be two - fold .",
    "first , we will present a rigorous mathematical justification of the formulae ( [ hilbert_alg_1])([hilbert_alg_2 ] ) for the singular operator @xmath43 different from that of @xcite .",
    "second , we will propose an algorithm which avoids programming formulae ( [ hilbert_alg_1])([hilbert_alg_2 ] ) altogether .",
    "it should be noted , that in our experience writing the code for the hilbert transform can be rather cumbersome , therefore this second algorithm can be viewed as an improvement .",
    "the hilbert transform is a singular integral transform , therefore , first of all , one has to specify the conditions under which this integral can be computed .",
    "the issue of existence of a rather general class of singular integral transforms ( including the hilbert transform ) has been addressed in the classical work @xcite of a. p. calderon and a. zygmund .",
    "the sufficient condition for the existence of the hilbert transform itself can be stated in a very concise way ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) :    [ exist_lemma ] if @xmath62 is hlder continuous , then the hilbert integral transform of @xmath62 exists as a cauchy principle value .    in this light ,",
    "the main result of @xcite can be stated as follows :    [ daripa_thm ] if @xmath80(z)$ ] exists as a cauchy principle value , than the fourier coefficients of this hilbert transform are given by formulae ( [ hilbert_alg_1])([hilbert_alg_2 ] ) .",
    "the proof of this theorem presented in @xcite starts with an observation that according to ( [ hilbert_tran ] ) and ( [ t_coeff ] ) , coefficients of the hilbert transform are given by the following formula : @xmath81    p. daripa and d. mashat proceed in their proof by computing the hilbert transform in the problematic region ( @xmath82 close to @xmath83 ) explicitly .",
    "a crucial step in the ensuing proof is the interchange of the order of integration in ( [ ck_long ] ) .",
    "we feel that the possibility of this interchange has to be carefully explained : although the argument that we present in this section is not exceptionally difficult , it nevertheless involves some reasoning and has to be carefully carried out",
    ".    we will now proceed with our argument .",
