    "the effect of quenched random disorder on phase structure and transitions is an important area of study that continues to attract a great deal of research .",
    "disorder is ubiquitous ( ideal pure transitions being the exception rather than the rule in nature ) and the effect on phase transitions can be profound .",
    "phase transitions are modified depending on the aspect of the system affected by the disorder , on the dimensionality , and on the number of components to the order parameter .",
    "of particular interest is a linear coupling between quenched random disorder and the order parameter , which allows for a random - field theoretical approach .",
    "also , the order of the transition is crucial as first - order transitions have additional considerations compared to continuous transitions .",
    "this is due to the presence of two - phase coexistence ( hence interfaces between ordered and disordered regions ) , intrinsically finite correlation length at the transition , and hysteresis effects for first - order compared to continuous phase transitions .",
    "this has made the experimental and theoretical studies of quenched random disorder effects at first - order transitions challenging .",
    "liquid - crystals ( lc ) are a particularly attractive system for the study of phase transitions into partially ordered phases .",
    "this makes them especially interesting for the study of the effects of quenched random disorder ( qrd ) , which are typically introduced by the random fixed dispersion of solid surfaces . in lc+aerosil systems ,",
    "the quenched random disorder is created by a dispersed gel of aerosil particles and is varied by changing the density of aerosils in the dispersion .",
    "a convenient measure of the introduced disorder is the grams of silica per @xmath2 of liquid - crystal , denoted the conjugate silica density @xmath3 , which is directly related to the surface area of solids as well as the mean - distance between solid surfaces @xcite .",
    "the aerosils used are silica spheres that can hydrogen bond together to form a fractal - like random gel .",
    "studies have previously been carried out by various groups on liquid crystals in an aerogel medium @xcite .",
    "aerogels are self - supporting structures and this places a lower limit on the disorder strength that can be probed . by contrast",
    ", the aerosil gel provides a weaker and more easily controlled perturbation , and thus opens up a physically interesting regime .    in this work",
    ", we study the effect of quenched random disorder due to a dispersed thixotropic aerosil gel on the weakly first - order isotropic to nematic ( _ i_-_n _ ) phase transition .",
    "the calorimetric results for the nematic to smectic-_a _ phase transition in @xmath0+aerosil samples have been previously reported and were shown to be consistent with results in @xmath1+aerosil samples @xcite . at the _ i_-_n _",
    "transition , the orientational order has a finite correlation length and is established in three dimensions , which is describable by a symmetric and traceless @xmath4 rank tensor @xmath5 @xcite ( as such , it possesses only five independent components ) .",
    "thus , nematic order belongs , in principle , to a @xmath6 , @xmath7 heisenberg class .",
    "however , by ignoring any biaxial character and aligning the orientation axis with a principle axis of a local frame , this tensor can be split into a scalar order parameter ( @xmath8 ) measuring the magnitude of orientational order about the orientation axis and a  headless  vector called the nematic director @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) describing the spatial orientation of this axis . in this simplified view",
    ", nematic order is described on short length scales by @xmath8 and on longer length scales by @xmath9 , which is useful in describing the elastic properties of the nematic structure .",
    "these measures of nematic order are related to the quadrupolar nematic order parameter by @xmath11 .    in principle , the effect of the aerosil gel network on the orientational order of the nematic phase is two fold .",
    "the silica gel firstly dilutes the liquid crystal and secondly creates a preferred local orientation @xcite .",
    "in addition , the first - order transition from the isotropic to the nematic phase necessitates the formation of interfaces between coexisting domains / phases , which must occur within the available void spaces .",
    "the latter effect is the classic result of quenched random disorder ; a distribution of transition temperatures due to the nucleation of ordered domains within voids having some size distribution .",
    "this leads to short - range order ( sro ) , a rounding of the transition , and suppression of the first - order character of the transition @xcite .",
    "the contribution of a random preferred local orientation effect to the total hamiltonian can be represented as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the orientation of the molecules over some small region where the orientation is approximately constant and @xmath14 is the random influence of the silica surface .",
    "the variance of this random field @xmath15 should be proportional to the density of solids dispersed in the lc medium .",
    "this term is squared due to the effective inversion symmetry of the molecules in the nematic phase .",
    "since the nematic order parameter is quadratic in @xmath13 due to the same inversion symmetry @xcite , eq .  ( [ eq : hr ] ) is also linear in the order parameter and hence constitutes a random field ( rf ) interaction .",
    "recently , eq .  ( [ eq : hr ] ) has also been interpreted as a random - anisotropy ( ra ) interaction @xcite but this seems only applicable to systems describable by a pure vector @xmath16 order parameter . the formation of interfaces and the resulting surface energy penalties places restrictions on the effects of @xmath15 depending on the elasticity of the nematic .",
    "light scattering measurements have shown that the nematic phase in liquid crystal and aerosil dispersions breaks up into large ( micron size ) but finite - size domains @xcite .",
    "in addition , more extensive optical studies focussing on the nature of the nematic director structure well below the _ i_-_n _ transition have shown that the director correlation length @xmath17 decays exponentially with distance , which is a hallmark of short - range order @xcite .",
    "these features are consistent with an rf interaction for nematics with qrd .    to date , the most thoroughly studied lc+aerosil system is the dispersion of type-300 aerosil in octylcyanobiphenyl ( @xmath1 ) , denoted @xmath1+aerosil .",
    "detailed calorimetric @xcite , x - ray scattering @xcite , x - ray intensity fluctuation spectroscopy @xcite , static and dynamic light - scattering @xcite , and deuterium nmr @xcite studies on the nematic to smectic-_a _ ( _ n_-sm_a _ ) and the isotropic to nematic ( _ i_-_n _ ) phase transitions of this system have shown that there are clear quenched random - field characteristics as well as finite - size scaling effects @xcite .",
    "calorimetry measurements on @xmath1+aerosil samples have been particularly useful in yielding detailed information on both the _ i_-_n _ and the _",
    "n_-sm_a _ phase transitions @xcite . the results for both transitions show a complex dependence of the transition temperature on the aerosil density . while the _",
    "n_-sm_a _ heat capacity peak remains sharp and evolves towards 3d-_xy _ behavior with increasing silica density , the _ i_-_n _ behavior is more complicated . for silica densities below @xmath18  g  @xmath19 , two heat capacity peaks ,",
    "closely spaced in temperature , were observed . at higher aerosil densities , the heat capacity peaks for both",
    "the _ i_-_n _ and the _ n_-sm_a _ transitions displayed a highly smeared and non - singular features .",
    "deuterium nmr measurements on deuterated @xmath1+aerosil dispersions , which were carried out over a wide range of silica densities , showed that the magnitude of the orientational order @xmath8 below the _ i_-_n _ transition temperature was essentially unchanged from bulk behavior @xcite .",
    "the amount of liquid crystal reorientation for field - cooled samples upon rotation within the dnmr field is small and decreases continuously with silica density up to @xmath20  g  @xmath19 ( the units will be dropped hereafter ) confirming distinct low and high @xmath3 behavior .",
    "a x - ray intensity fluctuation spectroscopy ( xifs ) study have found evidence of aerosil gel dynamics in @xmath1+aerosil dispersions indicating an elastic coupling between the gel and lc @xcite .",
    "the optical , calorimetric , dnmr , and xifs results all appear to be consistent with a model in which director fluctuations are suppressed with increasing aerosil density .",
    "the present work focusses on a different liquid crystal  octyloxycyanobiphenyl ( @xmath0 )  having dispersed in it the same type of aerosil over a comparable range of silica densities as the well - studied @xmath1+aerosil system .",
    "this liquid - crystal has several important differences from the closely related @xmath1 .",
    "the liquid - crystal @xmath0 has stronger smectic and nematic interactions than @xmath1 as evidenced by the higher transition temperatures , the larger bare correlation lengths for smectic interactions @xcite , and the larger elastic constants .",
    "more specifically , @xmath0 has a @xmath21 larger bend , @xmath22 larger twist , and @xmath23 larger splay nematic elastic constants than @xmath1 ( in the single elastic constant approximation , @xmath0 has a @xmath24 greater @xmath25 than @xmath1 with an overall uncertainty of @xmath26 ) @xcite .",
    "thus , comparison of behaviors between @xmath1+aerosil and @xmath0+aerosil systems allow for the isolation of general quenched random - disorder ( qrd ) effects from material specific effects , in this case the elasticity of the liquid - crystal host medium .    in general , this work reveals a non - monotonic silica density dependence of the _ i_-_n _ and _ n_-sm_a _ transition temperatures similar to that observed for @xmath1+aerosil but occurring over a larger @xmath3 range for @xmath0+aerosil .",
    "the calorimetric results presented here for the _ i_-_n _ transition reveal the onset of a double transition peak for @xmath27 with a @xmath3 dependence on the temperature distance between the two heat capacity peaks .",
    "evidence is presented that the first - order character of the _ i_-_n _",
    "transition continuously decreases with silica content , becoming approximately zero for @xmath28 . over the entire range of @xmath3 studied here ,",
    "the heat capacity temperature dependence away from the immediate vicinity of the transition region is bulk - like and independent of silica content .",
    "we speculate that the variance of the disorder @xmath29 may change through a first - order transition for nematics to account for these observations .",
    "such a variation of the disorder strength may be due to the silica surfaces introducing a low - order , paranematic - like , boundary layer initially screening the remaining liquid crystal material . the thickness of this boundary layer is strongly temperature dependent in the immediate vicinity of the _ i_-_n _ transition and as it shrinks , the screening becomes weaker .",
    "section  [ sec : exp ] describes the preparation of the @xmath0+aerosil dispersions as well as the ac - calorimetry technique employed .",
    "given in section  [ sec : results ] is a presentation of the results .",
    "all results are then discussed in section  [ sec : disc ] and related to results from previous lc+aerosil studies .",
    "directions for future study will also be discussed .",
    "the liquid crystal @xmath0 , purchased from aldrich , was used after degassing in the isotropic phase for @xmath30 hour .",
    "this liquid - crystal molecule has an aliphatic tail attached by an oxygen link to the rigid biphenyl core and a polar cyano head group ( @xmath31  g  mol@xmath32 ) .",
    "this oxygen link constitutes the sole molecular difference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "pure @xmath0 has a weakly first - order isotropic to nematic transition at @xmath33  k and a second - order nematic to smectic-_a _ transition at @xmath34  k. at lower temperatures , the strongly first - order crystal - sma transition occurs reproducibly on heating at @xmath35  k and , as usual , can be greatly supercooled .",
    "the hydrophilic type-300 aerosil obtained from degussa @xcite was thoroughly dried at @xmath36 under vacuum for a couple of hours prior to use .",
    "the hydrophilic nature of the aerosils arises from the hydroxyl groups covering the surface and allows the aerosil particles to hydrogen bond to each other .",
    "this type of bonding is weak and can be broken and reformed , which leads to the thixotropic nature of gels formed by aerosils in an organic solvent .",
    "crystallization severely disrupts the gel .",
    "the specific surface area measured by the manufacturer via bet nitrogen isotherms is @xmath37  m@xmath38  g@xmath32 and each aerosil sphere is roughly @xmath39-nm in diameter .",
    "however , saxs studies have shown that the basic aerosil unit consists of a few of these spheres fused together during the manufacturing process @xcite .",
    "each @xmath0+aerosil sample was created by mixing appropriate quantities of liquid crystal and aerosil together , then dissolving the resulting mixture in spectroscopic grade ( low water content ) acetone .",
    "the resulting solution was then dispersed using an ultrasonic bath for about an hour . as the acetone evaporates from the mixture , a fractal - like gel forms through diffusion - limited aggregation .",
    "small angle x - ray studies have shown that the aerosil gel dispersion has a fractal structure and no preferred orientation @xcite on the micron - long length scales of nematic order @xcite .    at room temperature ,",
    "@xmath0 is a crystalline solid even in the presence of high aerosil density .",
    "care was taken to avoid crystallization of @xmath0 and possible damage to the aerosil gel , especially for low silica densities . for this calorimetry study , the mixture after slow solvent evaporation was allowed to crystallize , and the solid sample was transferred into the calorimetry cell .",
    "the cell was then sealed , the heater and thermometer attached , and the cell was heated into the isotropic phase .",
    "the sample was then remixed by placing the assembly in an ultrasonic bath for over an hour .",
    "the cell and sample temperature was kept elevated during the mounting of the sealed cell into the calorimeter by maintaining current through the heater .",
    "this sample preparation protocol also allows a controlled entry into the crystal phase .",
    "however , since the cell is sealed , the in situ remix could not be inspected and so some small dispersion inhomogeneity may remain .",
    "high - resolution ac calorimetry was performed using two home - built calorimeters at wpi .",
    "the sample cell consisted of a silver crimped - sealed envelope @xmath40  mm long , @xmath41  mm wide , and @xmath42  mm thick ( closely matching the dimensions of the heater ) .",
    "after the sample was introduced into a cell having an attached @xmath43-@xmath44 strain - gauge heater and @xmath30-m@xmath44 carbon - flake thermistor , a constant current was placed across the heater to maintain the cell temperature well above @xmath45 .",

    "for @xmath0+aerosil samples , a similar and far more pronounced @xmath131 decrease in @xmath127 is seen from @xmath105 to @xmath104 .",
    "this decrease in @xmath127 reflects a greater depression of @xmath45 than @xmath63 and indicates that in this range of silica density , the disorder primarily effects nematic ( orientational ) ordering . upon further increasing @xmath3",
    ", the nematic range begins to increase and appears to saturate at an @xmath132 increase similar to that seen in the @xmath1+aerosil system .",
    "this growth in the nematic range occurs because of the greater suppression of @xmath63 relative to @xmath45 and so , reflects that above @xmath133 , the effect of the silica gel is to mainly disorder smectic ( 1d - translational ) ordering .",
    "the calorimetric results on the _ i_-_n _ transition temperature described above suggest the importance of sample homogeneity . as a test of the fragility of the silica gel",
    ", heat capacity scans were performed on a low and high density @xmath0+aerosil sample immediately before and after crystallization of the lc .",
    "such a thermal cycle for the @xmath105 sample is shown in fig .",

    "[ dcp200vsdt ] as a function of @xmath135 in order to suppress hysteresis effects of the _ i_-_n _ transition .",
    "the effect of crystallization on the @xmath105 sample is striking , revealing significant distortion of the @xmath73 signature at both the _ i_-_n _ and _ n_-sm_a _ transitions .",
    "the appearance of an additional broad @xmath73 feature beginning @xmath136  k below @xmath45 as well as a broadened feature over the _ n_-sm_a _ transition region after crystallization may indicate increased sample inhomogeneity , presumably caused by the local expulsion of silica particles as lc crystallites form .",
    "however , there are two puzzling aspects ; ( 1 ) the shift in @xmath45 is _ downward _ by @xmath137  k and ( 2 ) the specific distortion seen in @xmath73 about @xmath63 reveals an _ increased _ _",
    "_ transition enthalpy .",
    "the first aspect is counter - intuitive as the expulsion of impurities upon crystallization should have moved the system closer to bulk behavior by increasing the size of pure lc domains ( regions where no silica is present ) .",
    "the second aspect is particularly puzzling as the _ n_-sm_a _",
    "transition enthalpy after crystallization surpasses the _",
    "transition enthalpy for _ bulk _ @xmath0 ( @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 all given in units of j  g@xmath32 ) .",

    "the additional enthalpy observed here could indicate new solid phases for @xmath0+aerosil samples .",
    "these results are only observed upon initial crystallization of a freshly dispersed @xmath0+aerosil sample .",
    "bulk @xmath0 behavior is eventually approached upon repeated thermal cycling through the crystallization transition .",
    "clearly , at these low silica densities , the silica gel is , at least locally , quite fragile and short range restructuring of the gel can strongly affect the liquid - crystal .    the results of initial cycling through the crystallization transition for the @xmath134 sample shown in fig .",
    "[ dcp200vsdt ] do not reveal any significant changes . aside from a very small , sharp , additional heat capacity feature at the _ n_-sm_a _",

    "the shift in @xmath45 after the initial crystallization is small and upward by @xmath141  k , as expected by the expulsion of impurities .",
    "this indicates that for higher silica densities , the gel is robust and well behaved .",
    "note that there is no appreciable change in the nematic range , as seen in both fig .",
    "[ dcp050vsdt ] and [ dcp200vsdt ] .",
    "results have been presented from high - resolution ac - calorimetric experiments on @xmath0+aerosil dispersions with emphasis on the weakly first - order _ i_-_n _ phase transition .",
    "these results for @xmath0+aerosil dispersions have been compared with existing results for @xmath1+aerosil dispersions @xcite and reveal new aspects of the effect of quenched random disorder on liquid crystal phase transitions .",
    "in particular , these two lc+aerosil systems are very similar except for the relative elasticity of the lc material .",
    "the material @xmath0 is elastically stiffer , having an effective ( single ) nematic elastic constant @xmath25 larger by approximately @xmath142 , than @xmath1 , and this is reflected by the higher transition temperatures for the nematic , smectic , and crystal phases .",
    "thus , aspects that are lc material dependent and those that are general to quenched random disorder can be distinguished .    from the very good overlap of the @xmath73 wings away from the _",
    "i_-_n _ two - phase coexistence region and from direct nmr studies on @xmath1+aerosil @xcite a general feature of lc+aerosils is that the magnitude of the nematic order , @xmath8 , is essentially the same as in the bulk lc .",
    "thus , the main effect of qrd is on the director structure with the elasticity of the lc and the kinetics of the ordered phase growth as likely important factors .",
    "this is supported by the differences seen between @xmath0+aerosil and @xmath1+aerosil systems ; in particular , the different @xmath3 dependence is likely connected to the difference in elasticity for the two liquid - crystals .",
    "the effect of quenched random disorder on first - order phase transitions is substantially different than that on continuous phase transitions .",
    "first - order transitions have an additional energy penalty for the formation of interfaces between coexisting phases , which complicates random - field type theoretical approaches . in the classical treatment , first developed by imry and wortis @xcite , the qrd effect on first - order transitions",
    "is that a quenched random - field creates domains having a randomly shifted transition temperature .",
    "this would have the effect of smearing the overall transition , a monotonic decrease in the transition latent heat and temperature with increasing qrd , and a low - temperature phase possessing only short - range order for arbitrarily weak qrd .",
    "these predictions are generally consistent with the behavior of nematic in aerogels @xcite . for nematics in aerosils",
    ", the transition latent heat appears to decrease and the width of the coexistence region to increase monotonically with increasing disorder as well as the transition becoming apparently continuous for high disorder strength .",
    "these features are generally consistent with the classical picture .",
    "however , the character of the transition and the non - monotonic transition temperature shifts do not appear to be consistent with this view . more strikingly , the _ i_-_n _ transition in aerosils in some range of @xmath3 , appears to proceed via two transitions .",
    "this could only occur in the classical view if a bimodal distribution of the random - field variance @xmath15 , connected to a bimodal distribution in @xmath3 , is present .",
    "this is not supported by saxs studies , which revealed the fractal - like nature of the aerosil gel structure @xcite , nor the behavior at the _ n_-sm_a _",
    "transition @xcite .",
    "however , nematics are very `` soft '' materials and the qrd imposed by aerosils appears to be much weaker than that of aerogels , thus elasticity of the lc ( and possibly the gel ) can play an important role .    in lc+aerosil systems , @xmath15 is thought to depend on the given concentration of silica and interaction with the lc , whereas the lc elasticity @xmath25 is strongly temperature dependent ( being proportional to @xmath143 ) near and below @xmath45 . since the aerosil gel is thixotropic and formed in the isotropic phase , any high energy strains or deformations that may exist are likely quickly annealed , the anisotropy of the gel should be fixed and essentially zero , especially for rigid gel structures like aerogels",
    ". however , the disordering nature of the gels may evolve with thermal history of the lc in aerosil gels . as seen by the result of cycling through crystallization presented here as well as the dnmr @xcite and electro - optical @xcite studies",
    ", the gel can be compliant with respect to distortions in the director structure for a range of silica densities .",
    "note that the quantity @xmath45 differs by at most 10% between @xmath1 and @xmath0 thus the energy scales are similar while the twist elastic constant differs by 36% .",
    "the features described above suggests a possible physical scenario for the origin of the double @xmath73 feature at the _ i_-_n _ ( or any  soft  first - order @xcite ) transition in lc+aerosil systems . as the nematic elastic constant strongly increases with decreasing temperature for @xmath144 ,",
    "a  skin  of low nematic order ( due to the undulations of the aerosil strands ) may coat the silica strands .",
    "the thickness of this paranematic boundary layer would be strongly temperature dependent , shrinking with decreasing @xmath145 below @xmath45 .",
    "the presence of such layer a would serve to partially decouple the disordering ( or field ) effect of the silica gel from the void nematic ( acting as a kind of  lubricant  ) .",
    "once the layer thickness reaches its minimum value ( roughly equivalent to a molecular length ) the elasticity of the void nematic becomes strongly coupled to that of the aerosil gel .",
    "this would effectively increase , for a given @xmath3 , the disorder strength .    a consequence of this speculation for a first - order transition induced change in disorder strength ( through the onset of coupling between the director fluctuations and gel )",
    "would be the alteration of the gel dynamics ( i.e. , vibrational modes ) .",
    "this would be consistent with large changes in the relaxation times of aerosil gels observed by dynamic x - ray studies on @xmath1+aerosil near @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "in addition , this coupling should dampen director fluctuations and could account for the variation in the critical behavior seen at the _",
    "transition for lc+aerosil samples .",
    "another consequence of this view is that the director correlation length @xmath17 ( the relevant aspect of nematic order ) would jump to a large isotropic value at the first transition and upon further cooling cross a second transition into a more strongly disordered state having a _ smaller _ correlation length .",
    "the isotropic nature of @xmath17 and the final sro state of the nematic with qrd are consistent with recent optical studies @xcite and the detailed evolution of @xmath17 through the two transitions is the subject of current optical and calorimetric study @xcite .",
    "the different silica density dependence of @xmath45 and the temperature distance between the two @xmath64 peaks ( @xmath146 ) between @xmath0+aerosil and @xmath1+aerosil would also be consistent with the difference in the nematic elasticity of the two liquid - crystals . a stiffer silica gel ( higher @xmath3 )",
    "would be required to influence a stiffer lc , thereby stretching the shift in @xmath45 with respect to @xmath3 as seen between the @xmath0+aerosil and @xmath1+aerosil systems .",
    "the @xmath3 dependence in the high - density regime of @xmath146 for @xmath0+aerosil ( see table  [ tab : cp - sum ] ) compared to the nearly constant @xmath147  k seen only in the low density regime of @xmath1+aerosil @xcite would be compatible with a transition induced increase in the variance of the gel disorder strength .",
    "the liquid - crystal @xmath1 being much softer would only be able to stress a very weak ( low @xmath3 ) gel while the much stiffer @xmath0 would be able to distort a wider range of gels . since the @xmath3 dependence of the critical behavior for the _ n_-sm_a _",
    "transition is quite similar between @xmath1+aerosil and @xmath0+aerosil @xcite , these observations suggest that the effects observed at the _ i_-_n _ transition are not directly connected to those at the _ n_-sm_a_.    finally , the unexpected behavior of low silica density sample when initially cycled through the crystallization transition is not fully understood .",
    "the expulsion of silica impurities by the strongly first - order crystallization transition seems to lead to a _ more _ disordered system .",
    "one possibility to explain this phenomena is that the initial crystallization causes the expulsion of the silica particles locally and transforms the flexible fractal structure into a more rigid , foam - like , gel .",
    "the depression of @xmath45 is then a consequence of the greater elastic distortions imposed by the new gel arrangement .",
    "repeated cycling through crystallization would continue to expel impurities , eventually destroying the foam - like structure .",
    "once the silica has been compacted sufficiently , percolation is no longer possible and free - floating silica particles would represent an annealed disorder .",
    "the gels formed in the high silica density samples are more robust and would not be expected to change significantly when the lc crystallize .",
    "this view can be directly tested with a detailed structural study by small - angle x - ray scattering where the thermal history is carefully controlled .",
    "the increase in the enthalpy of the _ n_-sm_a _ transition after the initial crystallization to a value greater than the bulk lc value remains a puzzle . note that the speculations presented here for the double _ i_-_n _ transition peaks and the unusual hysteresis behavior are intended to motivate future experimental and theoretical studies .",
