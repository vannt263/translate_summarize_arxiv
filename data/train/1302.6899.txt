    "the study of asymptotic convergence properties of open quantum systems has been reinvestigated in the last decades thanks to the development of quantum information  @xcite and reservoir engineering  @xcite to stabilize and protect fragile quantum states ( see for example  @xcite and the references herein ) .",
    "the most standard models assume memoryless environments and are described by lindblad differential equations ( continuous - time ) or kraus maps ( discrete - time ) . during the 70 s",
    ", a line of work around @xcite has developed a sufficient algebraic convergence criterion for these models , known as the davies - sphon - frigerio ( dsf ) criterion .",
    "it ensures existence , uniqueness and global attractiveness of a full rank steady - state density operator .",
    "meanwhile , the particular structure of the quantum master equations also allows to investigate convergence with a geometric approach .",
    "indeed , one can define `` universal '' contraction metrics which are independent of the precise dynamics  @xcite . as noticed in  @xcite ,",
    "contraction analysis opens the way to developing systematic convergence - characterizing tools by examining where the contraction is strict .",
    "_ in the present paper , we propose such a tool in the form of a systematic lyapunov function design for quantum systems described by lindblad differential equations ; and we illustrate it by applying it to a practical reservoir engineering situation , _ motivated by our recent reservoir engineering proposal in @xcite . we limit ourselves to finite dimension for simplicity , although in principle",
    "similar results should be possible in infinite dimension .",
    "we thereby start from a characterization of the metrics that are ( non - strictly ) contractive for all kraus maps  @xcite .",
    "this characterization then leads to a systematic construction of ( non - strict ) lyapunov functions for all lindblad equations with a full - rank equilibrium ; a main advantage of these lyapunov functions is that their time - derivative has an explicit expression which lends itself well to an analysis of critical points .",
    "the resulting convergence criterion is different from the dsf criterion since it does not assume that the vector space spanned by the lindblad operators is closed by hermitian conjugation ( modulo identity ) .",
    "this allows for instance to rapidly show the following result not covered by the dsf criterion , in the context of our engineered reservoir application : any lindblad equation on the hilbert space of the ( truncated ) harmonic oscillator , which has a full - rank equilibrium and a decoherence channel proportional to the photon loss operator , globally converges to that equilibrium .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec:2 ] recalls the models describing the evolution of open quantum systems , both with discrete - time and continuous - time dissipative channels .",
    "section [ sec:3 ] reviews known contractive metrics for discrete - time quantum systems , described by kraus maps .",
    "section [ sec:4 ] contains our main results about systematic lyapunov functions for continuous - time quantum systems , described by lindblad - kossakowski differential equations .",
    "section [ sec:5 ] applies the result to obtain a convergence proof for a reservoir engineered to stabilize quantum cat states of an electromagnetic field mode .",
    "all the material presented in this section can be found with much more details in @xcite with developments centered around the experiment described in section [ sec:5 ] and in @xcite for more formal theoretical exposures .",
    "we consider a quantum system on a finite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath0 , whose state is represented by a density operator @xmath1 , i.e.  a self - adjoint , unit - trace positive semi - definite linear operator on @xmath0 which represents quantum probabilities .",
    "we denote the set of all density operators on @xmath0 by @xmath2 .",
    "if the quantum system is closed , it evolves according to the _ hamiltonian _ dynamics ( schrdinger dynamics with @xmath3 ) @xmath4\\ ] ] where @xmath5 , @xmath6 = ab - ba$ ] and the hamiltonian @xmath7 is a self - adjoint operator on @xmath0 .",
    "such evolution leads to a unitary propagator , i.e.  the evolution is an isometry for each @xmath8 and two states never converge towards each other .",
    "this behavior can be changed by considering open quantum systems . in particular a measurement operation on a quantum system",
    "perturbs it in a non - unitary ( in fact stochastic ) way .",
    "the present paper in contrast considers open systems where information is lost to the environment without being measured .",
    "the latter can be conceived as the reduction to our target system , on @xmath0 , of a hamiltonian dynamics on a larger hilbert space @xmath9 which is the tensor product of the target system and an external `` bath '' .",
    "open quantum systems can both be helpful , for stabilization , and detrimental if the bath induces dissipation `` in the wrong direction '' w.r.t .  our goal , also known as _",
    "decoherence_. typically , a quantum system interacts with both undesired decoherence sources , and stabilizing baths designed to counter them .",
    "one of the mainstream open quantum models assumes that the environment loses any information about the system between consecutive interactions . in discrete - time , this markov assumption leads to a _ trace - preserving completely positive map _ or _",
    "kraus map _",
    "@xmath10 for the density operator of the target system @xcite : @xmath11 the @xmath12 are arbitrary linear operators on @xmath0 ( but satisfying condition ) , @xmath13 denotes operator adjoint and @xmath14 is the identity operator . in continuous - time",

    "we review contraction - like tools to assess the convergence of and develop how they lead to lyapunov convergence arguments for .",
    "the stationary points of such dissipative evolutions are also known as _ pointer states _ in the physics literature @xcite .",
    "a particular case of markovian open quantum systems is obtained through _",
    "reservoir engineering_. we start with a discrete reservoir . in this case",
    ", at each step , a ` new ' auxiliary system ( thus carrying no memory about past system states ) is prepared in a predetermined initial state @xmath17 and brought into controlled hamiltonian interaction with the target system for a time @xmath18 ; the coupled systems thus evolve as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a unitary operator on @xmath21 , solution at time @xmath18 of the controlled schrdinger equation @xmath22 with initial state @xmath23 .",
    "target and auxiliary system are in general entangled . after interaction",
    "the auxiliary system is discarded ; the state of the target system is then described by taking the partial trace of @xmath24 over the auxiliary system hilbert space , and the resulting effect is described by a kraus map of type , where the @xmath12 depend on @xmath17 and the function @xmath25 over @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "now a new auxiliary system and interaction can be initiated , to iterate the ( potentially time - varying ) kraus map . with proper tuning",
    ", a stabilizing effect can be obtained ( see section [ sec:5 ] ) , without using measurement - based feedback .    in the limit of a very large number of short interactions per time unit ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 close to @xmath14 ) , a continuous - time model of type can be obtained .",
    "the latter is also often viewed as the continuous interaction of the target system with one large infinite - dimensional system ( e.g. thermal field environment ) .",
    "the content of this section is also presented with much more details in @xcite and relies essentially on the key contributions  @xcite .    * definition iii.1 : * _ a distance function @xmath29 defines a contractive metric for a kraus map @xmath10 if and only if @xmath30 for all @xmath31 . _    motivated by popular quantum results , we first consider ` distance functions ' in a wide sense : they may be asymmetric with respect to their two arguments , sometimes strictly defined only for full rank @xmath32 and/or @xmath33 .",
    "the latter point may be annoying when the goal of an evolution is to reach a _ pure state _",
    ", i.e.  a rank one density operator ; in presence of disturbances , a small residual proportional to @xmath14 usually solves the situation .",
    "thanks to the particular structure of markovian open quantum systems , there exist several metrics which are contractive for _ any _ kraus map ; see e.g.  @xcite for a summary :    * the trace distance @xmath34 . *",
    "the bures distance @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the quantum _ fidelity_. * the chernoff distance @xmath37 , where @xmath38 . * the quantum relative entropy @xmath39 . * the quantum @xmath40-divergence @xmath41 . *",
    "hilbert s projective cone metric : @xmath42 if @xmath32 and @xmath33 have the same support , and otherwise @xmath43 .",
    "all these metrics have their advantages and drawbacks , and none of them is always _ strictly _ contracting .",
    "the hilbert metric for instance is symmetric but non - riemannian , and also contractive in the dual ( a.k.a .",
    "heisenberg picture ) : defining @xmath44 for each self - adjoint operator @xmath45 on @xmath0 , such that @xmath46 , we have that @xmath47 and that @xmath48 is contractive for @xmath49 : this shows that any @xmath49 tends to bring the eigenvalues of any operator closer to each other .",
    "furthermore , the contraction ratio for @xmath10 is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "see @xcite for recent illustrations .",
    "+ when considering deviations from a target solution , it can be attractive to compare @xmath1 and @xmath52 with a riemannian metric on the set of strictly positive hermitian operators of trace one .",
    "this set is a sub - manifold of the vector space of hermitian operators . for each @xmath53 with full rank , @xmath54 belonging to the tangent space at @xmath1 , is any trace - less hermitian operator . by linearity of @xmath10 , definition iii.1",
    "readily yields :    * definition iii.2 : * _ a riemannian distance metric @xmath55 is contractive for @xmath10 if and only if ( with slight abuse of notation ) @xmath56 for all traceless hermitian @xmath54 and all @xmath57 .",
    "_    the following proposition results from the remarkable result by petz @xcite .",
    "* proposition iii.3 : * _ consider the riemannian metrics that are contractive for all ( finite - dimensional ) kraus maps .",
    "the set of these metrics can be parameterized via the formula _ @xmath58 _ where @xmath59 is solution of the sylvester equation _ @xmath60 _ and @xmath61 is a positive finite measure .",
    "_    in @xcite the metrics are parameterized by _ standard operator monotone ( decreasing ) functions _ , that is functions @xmath62 on the positive cone satisfying @xmath63 if @xmath64 ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 hermitian positive operators ) , with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",

    "* a measure @xmath69 concentrated on @xmath81 , gives the symmetric metric @xmath82 .",
    "our goal now is to make use of these kraus map contractive metrics to study convergence of lindblad - kossakowski differential equations . in particular , we want to improve the dfs criterion  @xcite which gives a sufficient algebraic condition characterizing the omega limit set .",
    "we therefore look for a systematic and strong lyapunov function design method . for standard characterizations of the distance to a target state @xmath83 , like e.g.  fidelity @xmath84 , the time - derivative can be hard to compute in an operator setting .",
    "it is therefore meaningful to look for lyapunov function constructions with handy computational properties .",
    "our main results build up as follows .",
    "* theorem iv.1 : * _ consider a full - rank density operator @xmath1 subject to any lindblad equation of the form .",
    "consider any of the kraus map contractive metrics parameterized as in proposition iii.3 .",
    "then such metric is also contractive under the lindblad equation as , for @xmath1 and @xmath54 following solutions of the lindblad equation , we have for each fixed @xmath85 : _ @xmath86 \\rho [ \\delta\\omega , l_k]{^{\\dagger } } )      \\\\   - \\sum_k\\ , { \\mathrm{tr}}([\\delta\\omega{^{\\dagger}},l_k ] \\rho [ \\delta\\omega{^{\\dagger}},l_k]{^{\\dagger } } ) \\ ; \\leq 0\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] _ with @xmath87 solution of at each time .",

    "so the hamiltonian term has no effect on @xmath97 .",

    "this result can be used to systematically build a lyapunov function for any lindblad differential equation , for which an equilibrium @xmath105 ( and nothing more ) is known .",

    "we apply the above framework to a cavity quantum electrodynamics experiment , whose goal is to manipulate the ( quantum ) state of an electromagnetic field mode through its interaction with atoms .",
    "a scheme of the setup is shown on figure [ fig : setup ] ; see @xcite for a thorough explanation of its working .        in summary ,",
    "a microwave field at frequency @xmath109 is trapped in the cavity @xmath110 made of superconducting mirrors .",
    "atoms are sent one after the other through @xmath110 , with the goal that the field interacts with an atomic transition at frequency @xmath111 . to this end , each atom is initially prepared by @xmath66 in one of the two states concerned by the relevant transition , and a classical microwave pulse in @xmath112 allows to put it in any superposition of those two states , parameterized by @xmath113 .",
    "in addition to choosing with @xmath113 the initial state of each atom , we can control the experiment by imposing during each interaction a tailored evolution of @xmath114 , the detuning between field and atomic transition frequency , with a good time resolution ( via a stark effect on the atom ) .",
    "varying @xmath115 around @xmath81 allows to combine resonant and dispersive physical effects , on the way to producing truly quantum phenomena ( see below ) .",
    "the elements @xmath116 and @xmath117 can be used to detect the atomic state e.g.  for feedback purposes @xcite . in the present case they play no role , since we use the atomic interactions as an engineered reservoir to control the field .",
    "this means that we consider the kraus map associated to the field evolution when tracing over the atomic states .",
    "in addition to this ( supposedly ) stabilizing action , we want to consider the effect of decoherence due to spontaneous photon loss of the field , characterizing how the engineered reservoir allows to counter it .",
    "we therefore begin by describing the situation without decoherence in discrete - time ( kraus map ) , then derive its associated lindblad equation , and add the traditional decoherence channel to this lindblad equation .",
    "from there , we can compute an equilibrium and analyze convergence using the result of section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "an electromagnetic field mode at frequency @xmath109 is modeled as a quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "its hilbert space is spanned by the orthonormal basis of _ fock states _",

    "we will denote the generic field state by @xmath1 or @xmath123 .",
    "the closest in this setting to a classical field state of complex amplitude @xmath124 , is the so - called _ coherent state _ @xmath125 to highlight specifically quantum features , in @xcite our goal is instead to reach quantum superpositions of such coherent states , of the type @xmath126 with fixed and known @xmath127 , @xmath128 .",
    "these are informally referred to as _ cat states _ in honor of the famous schrdinger cat .",
    "a particular set of cat states is generated by passing a coherent state through a _",

    "cat states are very quickly destroyed by typical perturbations .",
    "therefore , the in practice slow procedure of generating a cat state through a kerr medium is poorly usable , and more subtle schemes must be devised to _ stabilize _ them .    in @xcite , by tailoring the initial atom state ( @xmath113 ) and imposing a simple time - varing profile of the interaction parameter ( @xmath133 ) , we were able to propose an engineered reservoir such that one atom - field interaction , lasting a time @xmath18 , applies the following kraus map to the field ( modulo some reasonable approximations ; see @xcite for details ) : @xmath134 here the _",

    "this would be obtained e.g.  with a thermal bath at nonzero temperature .",
    "it seems worthwhile that theorem v.5 gives a formal result also for environments at zero temperature , which is the ideal situation for physical experiments .",
    "on the basis of a set of contractive metrics for kraus maps , we have systematically built a set of lyapunov functions which decrease under _ any _ lindblad - kossakowski evolution . in particular , unlike for many existing and popular convergence criteria such as fidelity , we obtain practical expressions for the rate of decay , allowing an efficient global investigation of mixed stationary states of the evolution .",
    "a major restriction of our approach is that it assumes an equilibrium of full rank . at the opposite side",
    ", pure state equilibria can usually be treated reasonably with fidelity - like indicators .",
    "an open question is thus how to efficiently treat systems with steady states of partial rank .",
    "we have illustrated our tool by proving convergence of an engineered reservoir scheme that stabilizes ` schrdinger cat ' states of an electromagnetic field mode .",
    "for this we have introduced an approximation of finite dimensional hilbert space .",
    "infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces , related to nonlocal pde formulations , are typical of quantum systems like the basic harmonic oscillator .",
    "systematic tools to alleviate the problems related to infinite dimension would thus be a welcome completion of this work ."
