    "this enumeration problem is crucial for the convergence of a certain model in discrete quantum gravity , called `` dynamical triangulations '' ; see for example the book @xcite or the survey @xcite for an introduction .    by deleting one simplex from any ( triangulated ) @xmath0-sphere",

    ", one can equivalently rephrase our enumeration problem by replacing `` @xmath0-sphere '' with `` @xmath0-ball '' .    to tackle the problem , in 1995 durhuus and jnsson introduced the class of locally constructible (  lc  ) manifolds , for which they were able to prove an exponential upper bound @xcite (",

    "the geometric idea is ingeniously simple .",
    "let us agree to call * * tree of @xmath2-simplices any triangulated @xmath2-ball whose dual graph is a tree .",
    "definitorially , * * lc manifolds are those triangulations of manifolds with boundary that can be obtained from some tree of @xmath2-simplices by repeatedly gluing together two _ adjacent _ boundary facets .",
    "this adjacency condition for the matching , together with the fact that trees are exponentially many , results in a global exponential upper bound .",
    "durhuus and jnsson conjectured that all @xmath0-spheres ( and all @xmath0-balls ) are lc .",
    "this was disproven only recently by the author and ziegler @xcite .",
    "the key for the disproval was a characterization of the lc property in terms of simple homotopy theory : `` a @xmath0-sphere is lc if and only if it admits a discrete morse function with exactly two critical faces '' ( * ? ? ? * cor .",
    "knot theory provides then obstructions to the latter property .    in 1995",
    ", mogami introduced another class of manifolds , henceforth called `` * * mogami manifolds '' @xcite .",
    "essentially , these are the triangulations of manifolds with boundary that can be obtained from a tree of @xmath2-simplices by repeatedly gluing together two _ incident _ boundary facets ( remark [ rem : characterization ] ) .",
    "since `` adjacent '' implies `` incident '' , lc obviously implies mogami .",
    "the converse is false : here we prove that a cone is mogami if and only if its basis is strongly - connected ( * proposition [ prp : cone ] * ) , so many cones are mogami but not lc .",

    "mogami s conjecture is weaker than durhuus ",
    "jnsson s , but a positive solution would still solve the enumeration problem : it would imply that there are only exponentially many @xmath0-balls .",
    "mogami s conjecture is harder to tackle , mainly because we lack a characterization of the mogami property in terms of simple homotopy theory .",
    "hence the methods that allowed to solve durhuus - jnsson s conjecture do not extend .",
    "meanwhile , in 2014 collet , eckmann and younan showed that the total number of @xmath0-spheres or @xmath0-balls crucially depends on the number of @xmath0-balls that have all vertices on the boundary . more specifically",

    "we combine mogami s and collet  eckmann - younan s intuitions , by characterizing the mogami property among @xmath0-balls without interior vertices .",
    "the only mogami nucleus is the tetrahedron .",
    "moreover , for @xmath0-balls _ without interior vertices _ , the following inclusions hold : _ @xmath3 _    in particular , bing s thickened house with two rooms @xcite and all non - trivial nuclei listed in @xcite yield counterexamples to mogami s conjecture .",
    "using knot theory , we can even give a coarse estimate for the asymptotic number of non - mogami balls :    let @xmath4 be a @xmath0-ball with a knotted spanning edge and with all vertices on the boundary .",
    "if the knot is    a single trefoil , then @xmath4 can be collapsible but it can not be mogami ;    a connected sum of @xmath5 or more trefoils , then @xmath4 is neither mogami nor collapsible .",
    "moreover , the number of non - mogami @xmath0-balls without interior vertices is asymptotically the same as the total number of @xmath0-balls without interior vertices .    with this , the problem of enumerating combinatorial types of @xmath0-balls remains wide open .",
    "all the known strategies expected to succeed in showing an exponential bound ( cf .",

    "a combinatorial criterion that divides the entire family of triangulated @xmath0-manifolds ( or @xmath2-manifolds , for any fixed @xmath2 ) into nested subfamilies , each of exponential size , was introduced in @xcite ; metric restrictions on triangulations that also give exponential bounds have been discovered in @xcite .",

    "as depicted in figure  [ fig : vertexstar ] , the gluing changes the topology of the boundary : @xmath6 becomes a * * singularity , in the sense that its link is disconnected .",
    "also , after the gluing , we no longer have a simplicial complex , because the pink triangles now share 2 edges out of 3 .",
    "we call such configuration of two boundary triangles sharing exactly 2 edges a * * wound .",
    "let us now perform a second identification , namely , let us glue the pink triangles together . as we do that",
    ", the topology changes back : the boundary - link of @xmath6 returns to be a single circle , as one of its connected components , the red digon , is sunk into the interior .",

    "the healing makes the wound disappear , as the triangle resulting from the identification is sunk into the interior .",
    "now , let us start back from @xmath4 and let us perform the same two gluings in _ inverse order _ : pink first , then green .",
    "there are two pleasant novelties with this reshuffling :    when the pink triangles are glued , they share @xmath9 edge , not @xmath5 .",
    "so the gluing is not a healing .",
    "when the green triangles are glued , they share @xmath9 edge , not just one vertex . as a result , the `` green gluing '' is now a legitimate lc gluing .    by postponing the mogami - non - lc move to after the healing move , topologically these two bizarre moves",
    "have ` canceled out ' ; and we have obtained a sequence in which all triangles that we match have exactly @xmath9 edge in common at the moment of the gluing .",
    "the final complex is obviously the same ball as before .",
    "using this idea , we will prove that all mogami @xmath0-ball without interior vertices are lc ( theorem  [ thm : main ] ) .",
    "the trick is to systematically rearrange the mogami sequence to obtain a sequence that is also lc .",
    "this does not work for all pseudomanifolds ; but if we focus on mogami constructions of @xmath0-balls without interior vertices , we know that the boundary - link of every vertex should eventually become a @xmath9-sphere .",
    "hence , all the extra components of a boundary - link created by mogami non - lc gluings have to be suppressed throughout the construction .",

    "possibly , the link of @xmath28 might acquire further connected components .",
    "this happens when the vertex @xmath142 identified with @xmath6 is also a singularity , a case we saw in example [ ex : nonhom ] .",
    "these cases , however , do not ruin our proof strategy  they just delay it . our remedy in fact is to anticipate all matchings of the type ( a ) and ( b ) described above , in a `` first round '' of identifications . for example , if a single triangle @xmath144 is later matched in a fold with some triangle @xmath145 outside @xmath198 , then we can rearrange the sequence by performing such lc gluing immediately . after all identifications of type (",
    "a ) and ( b ) have been carried out , if @xmath199 is the resulting pseudomanifold , we ask ourselves again : are all triangles of @xmath200 going to be matched exclusively with one another ? if not , we repeat the procedure above , in a second round of identifications , and we call the obtained pseudomanifold @xmath201 .",
    "and so on .",
    "the effect of these rounds on the boundary - link of @xmath6 is to expand it by inglobating new edges .",
    "we make a crucial claim : in these rounds of identifications , the components of the boundary - link of @xmath6 remain separate .",
    "the proof of this claim relies on lemma [ lem : impossible ] .",
    "in fact , suppose by contradiction that passing from @xmath199 to @xmath201 , say , we have included into @xmath52 an edge @xmath130 $ ] that belongs to another component of the boundary - link of @xmath6 ( which is what we have done in example [ ex : impossible ] . )",
    "this means that in @xmath201 we have a singularity @xmath6 , and two distinct triangles containing @xmath6 and the edge @xmath130 $ ] .",
    "so if we want to obtain a simplicial complex , we are forced to glue the two triangles together ; and with the same proof of remark [ rem : impossible ] , no matter how we continue this mogami construction , we are never going to achieve a @xmath0-ball without interior vertices . a contradiction .",
    "( this shows that the components of the boundary - link of @xmath6 never have an _ edge _ in common ; in analogous way , adapting lemma [ lem : impossible ] , one proves they can not have _ vertices _ in common , either . )    eventually , after a finite number of rounds , we will reach a pseudomanifold @xmath202 such that :    @xmath203 consists of @xmath204 connected components ,    @xmath4 is obtained with a list of mogami gluings from @xmath202 , a process in which exactly @xmath205 of the components of @xmath203 are going to be `` killed '' ,    if @xmath206 is the connected component of @xmath203 obtained from @xmath52 via merging operations , then for any edge @xmath31 of @xmath206 there exists an edge @xmath207 of @xmath206 such that , in one of the mogami gluings that leads from @xmath202 to @xmath4 , the triangle @xmath144 is identified with @xmath208 .",
    "in fact , we can repeat the reasoning above until the last property holds for _ all _ the @xmath205 `` doomed '' connected components of @xmath203 .",
    "note that @xmath206 contains _ all _ vertices of @xmath52 .",
    "this is because the merging operation does not delete any vertex . in particular ,",
    "the vertex @xmath209 of @xmath52 will be present in @xmath206 as well .",
    "we are now in the position to use lemma [ lem : lcorder2 ] .",
    "the mogami construction that leads from @xmath202 to @xmath4 yields a complete matching of the edges of @xmath206 .",
    "clearly , ordering the edges in @xmath210 is the same as ordering the triangles in @xmath211 ; also , two edges @xmath31 , @xmath207 are adjacent in the link of @xmath6 if and only if @xmath144 and @xmath208 are adjacent in the star of @xmath6 .",
    "let us thus reorder the gluings involving triangles in @xmath211 , according to lemma [ lem : lcorder2 ] , so that the vertex @xmath125 is deactivated last .",
    "in this order , the identifications `` killing '' the component @xmath206 are all lc gluings . furthermore , it is easy to see that _ all _ gluings mentioned above ( those leading from @xmath28 to @xmath202 , plus all lc gluings that kill @xmath206 ) can be performed before the identification @xmath189 . with this postponement",
    "the step @xmath189 becomes an lc gluing : in fact , after all other identifications have been carried out , @xmath212 and @xmath213 share the edge @xmath214 $ ] . in conclusion , by reshuffling the mogami sequence we got rid of the first non - lc step . by induction ,",
    "we reach our claim .",
    "[ cor : main ] let @xmath4 be a @xmath0-ball without interior vertices .",
    "the following are equivalent :    @xmath4 is mogami ;    @xmath4 is lc ;    some ( possibly empty ) sequence of spread operations reduces @xmath4 to a tree of tetrahedra ;    @xmath4 has trivial nuclei ( that is , some sequence of spread and split operations reduces @xmath4 to disjoint tetrahedra . )    `` ( 1 ) @xmath215 ( 2 ) '' follows from theorem [ thm : main ] .    ``",

    "* proposition 3.19 ) , one can obtain the following consequence of corollary [ cor : main ] :    [ lem : knot1 ] mogami @xmath0-balls without interior vertices do not contain knotted spanning edges .",
    "compare the result above with the following lemma ( which is known , but we include a proof for completeness ) :    [ lem : knot2 ] every ( tame , non - trivial ) knot can be realized as knotted spanning edge in some @xmath0-ball without interior vertices .",

    "examples of @xmath0-balls that are not mogami .",
    "in fact , we can prove an asymptotic enumeration result :    [ prop : asymptotics ] in terms of the number @xmath1 of facets , the number of non - mogami @xmath0-balls without interior vertices is asymptotically the same of the total number of @xmath0-balls without interior vertices .",

    "no matter how we choose @xmath4 , the union @xmath227 is going to contain the same knotted spanning edge of @xmath51 .",
