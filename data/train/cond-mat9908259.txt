    "magnetization measurements offer a way to directly probe the equilibrium ground state properties of 2degs in the quantum hall regime .",
    "such information is not directly accessible in magnetotransport or optical spectroscopy , in which non - equilibrium behavior of the system is measured .",
    "many years ago the de haas - van alphen oscillations of the magnetization were observed and used to characterize the dos of the 2deg @xcite . in recent years",
    "many - body effects , including those related to the fqhe and skyrmions , have also been observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "two different experimental setups are used : one method uses sensitive mechanical , torque magnetometers @xcite , and a more recent one uses a low noise , superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) @xcite .    various thermodynamic quantities , including the magnetization , have been calculated both for a disordered homogeneous 2deg within the hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) @xcite and a statistical model for inhomogeneities corresponding to the hartree approximation ( ha ) @xcite .",
    "these calculations show many - body effects reflecting screening and , in addition , the hfa produces exchange enhancement at odd filling factors due to spin splitting , and at even filling factors an enhancement , explored to lesser extent in experiments .    for finite systems kotlyar _ et al .",
    "_ calculated the persistent current in an array of quantum dots using mott - hubbard model for the intra - dot and inter - dot electron interaction @xcite . for two spin split levels per dot oscillations in the persistent current , which is equivalent to magnetization density ,",
    "were observed as a function of the number of flux quanta penetrating the system .    in the present work we calculate the magnetization of a two dimensional electron system confined to a rectangular box , subjected to a finite one - dimensional periodic potential .",
    "starting from a single unit cell we progressively increase the number of cells until we find convergence of the magnetization to the saw - tooth profile expected from the thermodynamic results .",
    "we discuss the edge and the bulk contribution to the orbital magnetization and the effects of the potential.we calculate separately the effects of the periodic potential in the infinite system , and compare the results .",
    "the electron - electron interaction is calculated in the ha for both the finite and the extended system .",
    "the model for a finite system consists of a laterally confined 2deg .",
    "a hard wall potential ensures that the electrons stay in the rectangular region @xmath0 a perpendicular magnetic field and an external modulating potential are applied to the system .",
    "the potential , which is of the form @xmath1 models @xmath2",
    "( @xmath2 integer ) parallel quantum wires of width @xmath3 and length @xmath4 .",
    "the length is chosen to be @xmath5 so the geometry of system is controlled by the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath6 . by defining a unit cell of area @xmath7 , the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath6 count the number of cells in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 direction , respectively .",
    "the total number of cells is @xmath10 .",
    "the wave functions of the finite systems are expanded in sine fourier series , since they are required to vanish at the boundary and the schrdinger equation is solved in the ha .",
    "the orbital magnetization in the finite system is calculated according to the definition @xcite @xmath11 in the extended system the ground state is calculated in the ha , by diagonalizing the hamiltonian in the landau basis , and by expanding the matrix elements as fourier series . therefore we can evaluate directly the magnetization by the thermodynamic formula appropriate for the canonical ensemble , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the total energy , and @xmath14 the entropy .",
    "we shall assume that the temperature is sufficiently low to neglect the entropy term .",
    "we use gaas parameters , @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the magnetic field is @xmath17 t , resulting in a magnetic length @xmath18 nm .",
    "the width of the wires is @xmath19 nm , modulation amplitude @xmath20mev , and the temperature @xmath21k . in order to compare the results for the finite system to the infinite one we define the quantity @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the number of electrons and @xmath24 is the landau level degeneracy . when @xmath25 we can interprete @xmath26 as the filling factor @xmath27 .",
    "since the modulation potential is anisotropic the system will behave differently depending on whether @xmath2 or @xmath6 is increased .",
    "here we consider the cases of one , two , and three parallel wires , @xmath28 , 2 and 3 , of varying length .",
    "we calculate for lengths , @xmath29 , corresponding to @xmath30 , 2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "the magnetization for the finite system is shown in figure [ fig : mag_tot ] .",
    "it is plotted in units of @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the bohr magneton containing the effective electron mass .",
    "the top panel shows the magnetization of a single wire , @xmath28 . for few electrons , @xmath34 , the current density circulates clockwise around the maximum density of the wire but for @xmath26 between 2 and 3 , depending on @xmath6 , the direction of the current reverses and the magnetization decreases again . around @xmath35 a single ,",
    "dominant current loop splits into two smaller ones for @xmath36 ( the current simply reverses for @xmath30 ) and the magnetization increases .",
    "the magnetization of two parallel wires , @xmath37 , is shown in the center panel in figure [ fig : mag_tot ] .",
    "more pronounced jumps around @xmath38 and 4 are due to denser energy levels because of the increased system size .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ehns ] the energy levels of the system and the chemical potential , shown as a solid line , are plotted as a function of the number of electrons .",
    "below @xmath39 the chemical potential traverses through relatively sparse ( longitudinal ) energy levels until it enters an energy interval corresponding to the second transverse energy band , with a lower slope .",
    "around @xmath35 it grows again .",
    "screening reduces the amplitude of the modulation potential , but for @xmath40 the wires are well isolated .",
    "a more complex situation occurs for three wires , @xmath41 , since there is a wire in the center of the system which is weaker coupled to the edges than the other two . at the boundary of the system there is a minimum in the hartree potential due to the positive background charges @xcite .",
    "as the wire length is increased , more states get localized around this minima and their contribution to the magnetization becomes more important .",
    "an interplay of this effect and contribution from the center wire causes the magnetization minimum preceeding the jump at @xmath35 to be shifted upwards , and for @xmath42 the region between @xmath38 and 4 is relatively flat . in order to estimate the bulk contribution to the magnetization we use equation ( [ eq : mag ] ) , but instead of integrating over the whole system we define a bulk area which is intergrated over .",
    "we choose this area to cover the center wire where we have taken 40 nm of its ends .",
    "the bulk magnetization , using the previous definition , is shown in figure [ fig : mag_bulk ] .",
    "this can be compared with the magnetization calculated for an infinite system of parallel wires ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) also defined by the potential ( [ eq : mod ] ) , shown in figure [ fig : mag_inf ] . in this case",
    "the energy spectrum consists of periodic landau bands .",
    "the deviations from the saw - tooth profile , corresponding to the homogeneous system ( @xmath45 ) are determined both by the reduced energy gaps , i.  e. the reduced jumps , and also by the energy dispersion , i.  e. the nonlinear behavior in between even - integer @xmath27-values .    in summary",
    ", the wire modulation used here shows that magnetization due to edge states is nontrivial and large in mircroscopic systems . at the same time",
    "the bulk contribution to the magnetization for the system assumes very early the form known for an infinite 2deg when the system size is increased .",
    "this might suggest experiments with a squid loop placed inside the system boundaries in order to verify the different contributions to the magnetization .",
    "the measurements of magnetization seem to provide a more direct access to the intrinsic equilibrium quantum many - electron structure of the system than transport and far - infrared experiments ."
