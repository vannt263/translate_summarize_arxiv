    "recent years have witnessed an increasing use of citation numbers for the quantitative assessment of scientific research activities , and many countries have already established national research evaluation agencies whose judgment criteria are based mostly on citation numbers  @xcite .",
    "the use of citation numbers for research evaluation has been criticized  @xcite , especially because the meaning of citations may be strongly context dependent  @xcite . as a matter of fact , however , citations play a crucial role in modern science , and often important decisions such as the granting of research funds  @xcite or institutional positions  @xcite are heavily influenced by numerical indicators based on citations .",
    "+ generally speaking , citations are interpreted as proxies for the impact or influence of papers in the scientific community .",
    "that is , the more citations a paper has accumulated , the more relevant this paper can be considered for its own scientific community of reference .",
    "citation numbers , however , are not only used for the quantitative evaluation of scientific publications , but also for the formulation and quantification of numerical indicators devoted at the assessment of the career of scholars  @xcite and the quality of scientific journals  @xcite . sometimes the use of citation numbers is also extended to the judgment of departments  @xcite , of institutions  @xcite and even of entire countries  @xcite .",
    "a fundamental problem in citation analysis is the presence of biases in citation numbers .",
    "it is for example well known that papers in mathematics accumulate citations at a rate much lower than papers in , say , chemistry .",
    "it is therefore unfair to directly compare citation numbers in mathematics and chemistry .",
    "suitably modified indicators should instead be used in order to remove such patent bias among disciplines .",
    "if such biases are not removed then they can affect comparisons from the level of individuals up to research groups or institutions . while a direct comparison among scholars in different disciplines may seem not so common ( although examples exist , see for example http://www.topitalianscientists.org/top_italian + _ scientists_via - academy.aspx ) when departments , universities or scientific institutions are compared , as it often occurs , this problem is unavoidable and potentially very dangerous .",
    "the lack of a proper handling of this bias may make those comparisons almost pointless .    slightly less severe , the problem of different citation patterns also exists for different fields within the same discipline  @xcite , where it is customary that citation records of scholars are compared in competitions for the same resources , such as academic positions or research grants .",
    "the problem of biases in citation numbers is therefore crucial , if not in cross - disciplinary comparisons , in comparisons among sub - fields or topics of research within the same scientific domain .",
    "several studies have dealt with this issue  @xcite .",
    "the common idea is the development of normalized indicators ( i.e. , the raw number of citations is divided by a discipline dependent factor ) able to suppress discrepancies among scientific domains .",
    "( for other approaches see  @xcite ) . independently of the particular recipe",
    "proposed , these studies do not generally provide a quantitative test able to determine whether their proposed method is able to effectively suppress citation biases or not  .",
    "+ one of the problematic issues for rescaled indicators is the attribution of papers to disciplines .",
    "this categorization is usually derived from an existing ( and questioned ) attribution of journals to disciplines : if a paper appears in a journal it is assumed to belong to the same category ( or categories ) the journal belongs to .",
    "this procedure has several obvious potential inconvenients  @xcite . to overcome this problem ,",
    "@xcite have recently proposed an indicator based on a fractional citation count  @xcite , i.e. , weighting each citation as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the total number of references in the citing paper .",
    "assuming that differences between citation patterns across domains are due to different typical lengths in reference lists , this method provides an implicit normalization of citation counts that does not require any explicit classification of papers into categories .    in this paper",
    ", we contribute to the search for effective ways to remove the bias in two ways .",
    "+ first , we propose a general method for testing the effectiveness of numerical indicators aimed at the removal of biases in citation counts among scientific domains .",
    "the method relies on a simple selection process and compares the values of the indicator under test with those expected under the hypothesis that the indicator is not biased .",
    "indicators able to suppress citation biases should produce results statistically consistent with an unbiased selection process , while their failure in the test directly indicates their non - effectiveness in the suppression of biases .",
    "+ secondly , as a practical application , we apply the method to two recently proposed normalization schemes for paper citation counts .",
    "we consider a large database of physics papers , which has the important feature that the attribution of papers to categories is directly provided by authors and thus can be considered to be accurate . in this way",
    "the categorization step is not a potential source of problems .",
    "we show that , while the rescaled indicator of  @xcite effectively allows an unbiased comparison among different sub - fields , the fractional citation count of  @xcite largely fails the same test and does not constitute a substantial improvement over raw citation numbers .",
    "we would like to stress that our notion of `` fairness '' is based on the strong assumption that each discipline or field of research has the same importance for the development of scientific knowledge . according to our assumption ,",
    "a `` fair '' numerical indicator based on citation numbers assumes values that do not depend on the particular scientific domain taken under consideration .",
    "it is clear that our notion of fairness strongly depend on the classification of papers into categories ( disciplines , fields , topics ) .",
    "also it is important to remark that other possible definitions of fairness could be stated without relying on the assumption that each discipline or research field has the same weight for scientific development .",
    "we consider all papers published in journals of the american physical society ( aps , www.aps.org ) between years @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the _ xml _ file containing all the relevant information about publications in aps journals up to @xmath3 was directly provided by the editorial office of aps + ( http://publish.aps.org/datasets-announcement ) .",
    "we restrict our analysis only to standard research publications ( letters , rapid communications , brief reports and regular articles ) and exclude other type of published material ( editorials , reviews , comments , replies and errata ) which may show distinct citation patterns .",
    "the journals considered in our analysis are : physical review letters , physical review a , physical review b , physical review c , physical review d and physical review e. aps journals are the most typical publication outlets in physics and cover all sub - fields of this discipline .",
    "they therefore represent an optimal benchmark for the study of citation patterns of publications within physics  @xcite .",
    "the classification of papers into distinct categories is provided by pacs numbers , which are alphanumerical codes denoting the topic discussed in the paper and are attributed to papers by authors themselves .",
    "pacs codes are composed of three fields @xmath4 , where the first two are numerical ( two digits each ) and the third is alphanumerical . for our purpose",
    "we consider only the first digit of the @xmath5 code , which provides a classification into very broad categories ( http://publish.aps.org/pacs ) .",
    "hence , for example , two papers with pacs codes @xmath6 and @xmath7 both belong to the category @xmath8 , while a paper with pacs number @xmath9 is part of the category @xmath10",
    ".    the first year of the temporal range of our analysis is @xmath2 , because in that year pacs numbers started to be systematically used .",
    "we consider only papers classified according to the pacs codes , which are the vast majority ( @xmath11 between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , nowadays the selection by authors of at least one pacs number is compulsory at the submission stage ) of all papers published in aps journals , for a total of @xmath12 papers . in general , authors assign to a paper two or three pacs numbers . in our analysis , we classify papers only according to their principal pacs number .",
    "this set of articles represents our set of cited papers , and here we will study only the properties of the citations received by these papers . for this purpose ,",
    "each article in the set of cited papers was also retrieved in the webofscience ( wos , www.isiknowledge.com ) database .",
    "we collected several information , but mainly their unique wos identification numbers and their total number of cites ( i.e. , the field `` times cited '' ) .     and @xmath3 .",
    "papers in the cited set are classified in research topics , according to their principal pacs number .",
    "the @xmath13 of the citations received by the set of cited papers is originated by papers published between @xmath2 and @xmath14 in the same journals .",
    "we also consider an additional set of papers , published in other @xmath15 scientific journals between @xmath2 and @xmath14 , which cover an additional @xmath16 of the total citations received by papers in the set of cited papers .",
    "the remaining @xmath17 of the citations is not included in our analysis.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    as set of citing papers , we first consider @xmath18 papers published in the same journals as those belonging to the set of cited papers , but published between @xmath2 and the beginning of @xmath14 .",
    "for each of these papers we obtain from wos their list of references . in the reference list provided by wos , cited papers",
    "are reported as unique wos identification numbers .",
    "this information enables to match referenced papers with those belonging to the set of cited papers . with this first step ,",
    "we are able to cover about the @xmath13 of the total number of citations declared by wos , calculated as the sum of all cites indicated in the field `` times cited '' of the set of cited papers . in order to increase the coverage of the set of citing papers ,",
    "we collect also the list of references of @xmath19 additional articles published in other @xmath15 journals between @xmath2 and the beginning of @xmath14 .",
    "these journals are selected because listed as top citing journals to the set of cited journals in the @xmath20 edition of journal of citation reports ( jcr ) database .",
    "please note that this list includes not only physics journals , but also chemistry , biology , engineering and multidisciplinary journals .",
    "the inclusion of this new set of citing articles enables us to cover about the @xmath21 of the total number of citations received by the set of the cited papers ( see figure  [ fig : ill ] ) .",
    "the entire data collection of cited and citing papers was performed between march @xmath22 and march @xmath23 , @xmath14 .",
    "we consider two normalization procedures which have been recently proposed for cross - discipline comparisons of paper citation counts by  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the two schemes are conceptually different : in the former , citation weights are functions of the papers from which citations are originated ; in the latter , citation weights are functions of the papers receiving citations . in the following ,",
    "we provide detailed descriptions of both methods .",
    "@xcite have recently proposed a novel normalization scheme aimed at eliminating differences in citation counts among papers belonging to different scientific disciplines or about different topics .",
    "the method is based on the intuitive assumption that papers tend to cite other articles dealing with similar topics .",
    "the whole citation network is therefore organized into clusters of elements with reasonable high density of internal citations , while citations among different clusters are more rare . under these assumptions ,",
    "the average number of citations received by papers in a given compartment is proportional to the typical length of the reference list of articles published in that compartment .",
    "papers in mathematics receive less citations than papers in biology because a typical paper in mathematics has a shorter reference list than a typical paper in biology .",
    "the method by  @xcite , called \" fractional citation count  , simply weights a citation from paper @xmath24 to paper @xmath25 as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the total number of articles referenced by paper @xmath24 . in fractional citation count",
    ", the value @xmath28 of the indicator for paper @xmath25 is given by the sum of all citations received by paper @xmath25 , where each citation is opportunely divided by the number of references of the citing paper @xmath29 where @xmath30 if paper @xmath24 cites paper @xmath25 , while @xmath31 otherwise",
    ". + the method has the great advantage that it does not formally require any _ a priori _ classification of the papers into scientific domains .",
    "this is a great advantage in many situations , because obtaining a reasonable classification of papers is very often nontrivial . this method does not require any external information regarding the classification of papers in different classes , but , as the authors claim , fractional citation counts `` automatically '' include the typical feature of the citation pattern of the cited papers .",
    "the practical disadvantage of the method is however the necessity of considering the whole list of citing papers , which may be difficult to retrieve .",
    "+ the method has been already applied to the evaluation of departments in universities  @xcite , to a new estimation of the impact factor of scientific journals  @xcite , and to a novel formulation of the @xmath32-index  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the indicators developed by  @xcite and  @xcite for the assessment of the impact of scientific journals are based on a source normalization scheme for citations .",
    "the difference with respect to the indicator based on fractional citation count is , however , that the normalizing factor is not the exact length of the reference list of the citing paper , but instead the average length of the reference lists of all papers published in the same journal as the one of the citing paper .",
    "these studies propose interesting alternatives to the impact factor but also stress the inability of fractional citation count to well account for the degree of cross - field citations and the growth of the literature in a field of research .      a different approach aimed at suppressing citation biases in cross - disciplinary comparisons",
    "is the one originally proposed by  @xcite and then considered also by  @xcite . assuming that papers are classified in compartments corresponding to scientific disciplines and fixed years of publication , the authors showed that the only relevant difference in citation patterns corresponding to different compartments is the value of a single number @xmath33 , the average number of citations received by papers published in a given scientific discipline and in a given year of publication . by assigning to each paper a relative citation count indicator @xmath34 defined as the total number of cites",
    "@xmath35 received by the paper divided by the value of @xmath33 corresponding to the category and year of publication of the paper ,  @xcite were able to show that this quantity obeys a probability density function that is universal among scientific disciplines .",
    "the indicator based on rescaled citation counts thus provides a natural way of eliminating biases among scientific disciplines , since the probability to have a paper with relative indicator @xmath36 equal to a certain value no longer depends on the particular discipline under consideration .",
    "+ the practical disadvantage of the rescaled citation count indicator is related to the potential difficulties that may arise in the classification of papers in scientific disciplines . in general ,",
    "classifications are made at the level of scientific journals , and this may lead to some inconsistencies in the classification of papers .",
    "journals belong to more than a scientific discipline if they publish papers about different subjects .",
    "then , all papers published in these journals will belong to more scientific disciplines because their classification is based on the classification of the journals where they were published , but in reality each of these papers is just about a particular scientific subject and their multi - disciplinary feature is just an artifact of the classification procedure .",
    "on the other hand , the results of  @xcite show a very interesting and not trivial feature of the citation habits in science : apart from a typical citation scale , which is discipline dependent , the way citations accumulate is the same in all disciplines . more practically , the universal shape of the citation distribution ( i.e. , a lognormal distribution ) allows to estimate the confidence intervals of the rescaled citation count indicator  @xcite .",
    "+ in the original paper ,  @xcite analyzed @xmath37 different scientific disciplines .",
    "the analysis has been recently extended to more complete datasets by  @xcite and  @xcite , showing that in general the universality of the citation distribution holds in many scientific disciplines , with the notable exception of many social sciences  @xcite .",
    "rescaled citation counts have been applied also to more refined contexts for the quantification of scientific relevance of papers in sub - topics within the same discipline : @xcite focused their attention on papers published in chemistry journals , while @xcite on papers published in journals of physics .      according to our definition ,",
    "the value of a fair indicator associated to a paper should not depend on the particular category ( topic of research or scientific discipline ) of the paper .",
    "in other words , the probability of finding a paper with a particular value of a fair indicator must not depend on the topic / discipline of research of the paper , it must be the same across fields of research or scientific disciplines .",
    "the `` fairness '' of a citation indicator is therefore directly quantifiable by looking at the ability of the indicator to suppress any potential citation bias related to the classification of papers in disciplines or topics of research .",
    "+ based on these assumptions , here we propose a simple statistical test able to assess the fairness of a citation indicator .",
    "the procedure is very general and can be simply applied to any type of classification and/or any type of numerical indicator based on citations . +",
    "imagine to have a set of @xmath38 total papers divided in @xmath39 different categories .",
    "indicate with @xmath40 the number of papers belonging to the @xmath41-th category .",
    "each paper in the entire set has associated a score calculated according to the rules of the particular indicator we want to test .",
    "imagine now to extract the top @xmath42 of papers from the whole set of papers .",
    "the list of the top @xmath42 papers in the dataset is composed of the @xmath43 papers with the highest values of the score ( @xmath44 stands for the largest integer number smaller than or equal to @xmath45 ) .",
    "if the numerical indicator is fair , the presence in the top @xmath42 should not depend on the particular category to which the paper belongs .",
    "that is , the presence of an article of the @xmath41-th category in the top @xmath42 should depend only on the number @xmath40 of papers in category @xmath41 , and not on the fact that papers in category @xmath41 may be privileged for some other particular reason . under these conditions ,",
    "the number of papers @xmath46 in category @xmath41 that are part of the top @xmath42 of the whole ranking is a random variate obeying the hypergeometric distribution  ] with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "here however , we perform only independent tests of fairness and consider one category at time . ] @xmath49 @xmath50 $ ] is a binomial coefficient which calculates the total number of ways in which @xmath51 elements can be extracted out @xmath45 total elements .",
    "( [ eq : hyper ] ) describes a simple urn model  @xcite , where elements ( i.e. , papers in our case ) are randomly extracted from the urn without replacement . with this statistical model",
    "we can simply calculate the expected number of papers in category @xmath41 present in the top @xmath42 as @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , we can make use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hyper ] ) for estimating confidence intervals or other relevant statistical quantities .",
    "we base our entire analysis on the bibliographic data set described in sec .  [",
    "sec : mat ] .",
    "a category here is therefore intended as the collection of all papers published in the same year and with the same first digit of the principal pacs number .",
    "this means that we have at our disposal a total of @xmath53 different categories : @xmath54 different years of publication and @xmath55 different pacs numbers .",

    "this problem affects only the computation of the numerical indicator based on fractional citation counts , but for consistency we prefer to use the same amount of information also for the computation of raw and rescaled citation counts .     for different pacs classification codes and different values of @xmath58 .",
