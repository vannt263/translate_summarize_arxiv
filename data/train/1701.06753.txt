    "the concept of isogeometric analysis @xcite can be employed to solve high order pdes ( i.e. , partial differential equations ) , see e.g. @xcite for @xmath7-th order pdes and @xcite for @xmath8-th order pdes .",
    "the main idea is to use the same spline function space to represent the physical domain and to describe the solution space .",
    "thereby , the high order pdes are solved via their weak forms using standard galerkin discretization , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this requires in general spline function spaces of @xmath9-smoothness or even higher .",

    "the study of @xmath9-smooth isogeometric spline spaces over multi - patch domains has been started in the last three years .",
    "mainly , two approaches are considered depending on the used parameterization of the physical domain .",
    "while in the first approach ( e.g. @xcite ) the domain parameterizations are @xmath9-smooth along the patch interfaces except in the vicinity of extraordinary vertices , in the second approach ( e.g. @xcite ) the domain parameterizations belong to a special class of parameterizations , called analysis suitable @xmath15 multi - patch parameterizations in  @xcite . in contrast to the first approach , these parameterizations require only @xmath16-smoothness along the patch interfaces . amongst others",
    ", the class of analysis suitable @xmath15 multi - patch parameterizations contains the class of bilinearly parameterized multi - patch domains , which has been considered first ( cf .",

    "we investigate the dimension of the spaces of _ @xmath4_-smooth biquintic and bisixtic isogeometric functions on bilinearly parameterized multi - patch domains by analyzing all possible configurations of such multi - patch domains .",
    "this is done by decomposing the @xmath0-smooth isogeometric spline space into the direct sum of three subspaces , which are called patch space , edge space and vertex space . whereas the computation of the dimension of the first two subspaces can be seen as a generalization of results in  @xcite for the two - patch case ,",
    "the computation of the dimension of the vertex space for all possible configurations of bilinear multi - patch domains is a non - trivial task .",
    "this can be expected from the results for triangulated domains , cf .",
    "our obtained results cover all possible configurations of bilinear multi - patch domains , which is in contrast to the results for the @xmath9 case in  @xcite , where only the so - called generic configuration was considered .",
    "in addition , an algorithm for the construction of a basis for the space of @xmath0-smooth geometrically continuous isogeometric functions is presented , which is based on the concept of minimal determining sets ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) for the involved spline coefficients .",
    "numerical results indicate that the resulting basis functions are well conditioned .",
    "a different method similar to the first approach above is described in  @xcite , where a polar spline configuration is used .",
