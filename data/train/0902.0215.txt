    "in a recent paper @xcite , calvi and levenberg have developed the theory of `` admissible meshes '' for uniform polynomial approximation over multidimensional compact sets .",
    "their theory is for @xmath0 , but here we restrict our attention to @xmath1 , the relevant definitions and results being easily adaptable to the general case .",
    "we begin with introducing some notation .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 is compact .",
    "we will require that @xmath3 not be too small , that is , that it is _ polynomial determining _",
    ", i.e. , if a polynomial @xmath4 is zero on @xmath5 then it is identically zero",
    ". this will certainly be the case if @xmath3 contains some open ball , as will be the case for all our examples .",
    "we will let @xmath6 denote the space of polynomials of degree at most @xmath7 in @xmath8 real variables .",
    "then , a _ weakly admissible mesh _",
    "( wam ) of @xmath3 is a sequence of discrete subsets @xmath9 such that @xmath10 where @xmath11 and the constants @xmath12 have ( at most ) polynomial growth in @xmath13 i.e. , @xmath14 and @xmath15 throughout the paper , @xmath16 .",
    "when @xmath17 is bounded , @xmath18 , we speak of an _ admissible mesh _ ( am ) .",
    "it is easy to see that ( w)ams satisfy the following properties ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) :    * for affine mappings of @xmath3 the image of a wam is also a wam , with the same constant @xmath12 * any sequence of sets containing @xmath19 , with polynomially growing cardinalities , is a wam with the same constants @xmath12 * any sequence of unisolvent interpolation sets whose lebesgue constant grows at most polynomially with @xmath7 is a wam , @xmath12 being the lebesgue constant itself * a finite union of wams is a wam for the corresponding union of compacts , @xmath12 being the maximum of the corresponding constants * a finite cartesian product of wams is a wam for the corresponding product of compacts , @xmath12 being the product of the corresponding constants .    as shown in @xcite , such meshes are very useful for polynomial approximation in the max - norm on @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , given the classical _ least - square _ polynomial approximant on @xmath19 to a function @xmath20 , say @xmath21 , we have that @xmath22 see ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) . moreover , _",
    "fekete points _",
    "( points that maximize the vandermonde determinant ) extracted from a wam have a lebesgue constant with the bound @xmath23 that is @xmath12 times the classical bound for the lebesgue constant of true ( continuum ) fekete points ; see @xcite .",
    "recently , a new algorithm has been proposed for the computation of approximate fekete points , using only standard tools of numerical linear algebra such as the qr factorization of vandermonde matrices , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "these results show that in computational applications it is important to construct wams with low cardinalities and slowly increasing constants @xmath12 .",
    "we recall that is always possible to construct easily an am on compact sets that admit a markov polynomial inequality , as is shown in the key result ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm . 5 ) .",
    "there are wide classes of such compacts , for example convex bodies , and more generally sets satisfying an interior cone condition , but the best known bounds for the cardinality of the resulting meshes grow like @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the exponent of the markov inequality ( typically @xmath26 in the real case ) .",
    "this means that , for example , for a 3-dimensional cube or ball one should work with @xmath27 points , a number that becomes practically intractable already for relatively small values of @xmath7 ( recall that the number of points determines the number of rows of the least squares ( non - sparse ) matrices ) .",
    "but already in dimension two , working with @xmath28 points makes the construction of polynomial approximants at moderate values of @xmath7 computationally rather expensive .",
    "the properties of wams listed above ( concerning finite unions and products ) suggest an alternative : we can obtain good meshes , even on complicated geometries , if we are able to compute wams of low cardinality on standard compact `` pieces '' .",
    "for example , it is immediate to get a @xmath29 wam with @xmath30 for the @xmath8-dimensional cube , as the tensor - product of 1-dimensional fekete ( or chebyshev ) points .    in this paper",
    "we introduce the notion of _ geometric _ wam , that is a wam obtained by a geometric transformation of a suitable low - cardinality discretization mesh on some reference compact set , like the @xmath8-dimensional cube .",
    "such geometric wams , as well as those obtained by finite unions and products , can be used directly for discrete least squares approximation , as well as for the extraction of good interpolation points by means of the approximate fekete points algorithm described in @xcite , on compact sets with various geometries .    in section 2",
    "we illustrate the idea of geometric wams by several examples in @xmath31 , the disk , triangles , trapezoids , and polygons . in section 3",
    "we prove a general result on the asymptotics of approximate fekete points extracted from wams by the greedy algorithm in @xcite .",
    "finally , in section 4 we present some numerical results concerning discrete least squares approximation and interpolation at approximate fekete points on geometric wams .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath32 be compact subsets of @xmath1 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 a sequence of discrete subsets of @xmath32 .",
    "geometric _ wam of @xmath3 is a sequence @xmath35 where the defining properties of a wam , ( [ wam])-([wam3 ] ) stem from the `` geometric structure '' of @xmath3 , @xmath32 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . to make more precise this still somewhat vague notion , we give some illustrative examples in @xmath31 , where the reference compact @xmath32 is a rectangle .",
    "a geometric wam of the disk can be immediately obtained by working with _",
    "polar coordinates _",

    "recall that @xmath47 chebyshev - lobatto points are near - optimal for 1-dimensional polynomial interpolation , and @xmath48 equally spaced points are near - optimal for trigonometric interpolation , both having a lebesgue constant @xmath49 ; cf .",
    "now , for every @xmath44 we can write @xmath50 where @xmath51 is independent of @xmath52 since the @xmath53 are the @xmath47 chebyshev - lobatto points in @xmath54.$ ] further @xmath55 where @xmath56 is independent of @xmath57 since the @xmath58 are @xmath48 equally spaced points in @xmath59.$ ] thus @xmath60 i.e. , @xmath61 is a wam for the disk with @xmath62 .",
    "we conclude by observing that the number of distinct points in @xmath63 is , due to the fact that @xmath64 @xmath65.@xmath66 0.2 cm    in figure [ disk ] , we display the polar grid @xmath37 and the wam @xmath19 in the unit disk for @xmath67 ( @xmath68 points and @xmath69 points , respectively ) . in view of the structure of @xmath37 and @xmath36 , the points of the geometric wam cluster at the boundary and at the center of the disk .",
    "note that this technique can also be used to construct geometric wams for annuli and even a ball in higher dimensions .",
    "however we will not pursue this here .     for the unit disk.,title=\"fig : \" ] for the unit disk.,title=\"fig : \" ]      in the case that @xmath36 is a _ polynomial map _ , we can give the following general    let @xmath70 be a wam of @xmath32 , and @xmath71 a surjective polynomial map of degree @xmath72 , i.e. , @xmath73 with @xmath74 .",

    "all these wams have @xmath86 , but the padua points have minimal cardinality @xmath87 , whereas the cardinality of tensor - product points is @xmath88 .",
    "we recall that , given the 1-dimensional chebyshev - lobatto points @xmath89 the padua points of degree @xmath7 are given by the union of two chebyshev - lobatto grids @xmath90    there is a simple quadratic map from the square to any triangle with vertices @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , namely the duffy transformation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath94 which collapses one side of the square ( here @xmath95 ) onto a vertex of the triangle ( here @xmath96 ) . by this map , the padua points @xmath97 of the square ( cf .",
    "( [ padua ] ) ) are transformed to the wam @xmath98 of the triangle , with constants @xmath99 . the number of distinct points in @xmath100 is @xmath101 . in figure",

    "the padua points @xmath107 of the square are mapped to the wam @xmath108 of the polynomial trapezoid , with @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "in figure [ trap ] we show the wams @xmath98 and @xmath111 obtained by mapping the padua points onto a linear trapezoid ( quadratic map ) and a cubic trapezoid ( quartic map ) , again for @xmath67 ( the numbers of points are @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively ) .",
    "as expected , we observe clustering at the sides and at the vertices of the trapezoids .",
    "notice that it could happen that @xmath114 , namely when the graphs of @xmath115 and @xmath116 intersect at some @xmath117 ( the @xmath118 chebyshev - lobatto points of @xmath119 $ ] ) .     for a linear and a cubic trapezoid.,title=\"fig : \" ] for a linear and a cubic trapezoid.,title=\"fig : \" ]      a relevant example concerning finite unions is given by polygons , which are very important in applications such as 2-dimensional computational geometry .",
    "as known , any simple ( no interlaced sides ) and simply connected polygon with @xmath120 vertices can be subdivided into @xmath121 triangles , and this can be done by fast algorithms , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite .",
    "once this rough triangulation is at hand , we can immediately obtain a geometric wam @xmath19 for the polygon by union of the geometric wams constructed by mapping the padua points on the triangles , with @xmath42 and @xmath122 , in view of the basic properties of wams and the results of section 2.2.1 .",
    "the points of the union wam will cluster especially at the triangles common sides and vertices .",
    "a similar approach is to subdivide into linear trapezoids , where we again obtain by finite union a geometric wam @xmath19 for the polygon with @xmath42 and @xmath123 ( see section 2.2.2 ) . in figure [ polygons ] we show geometric wams generated by subdivision into linear trapezoids of a convex and a nonconvex polygon , for @xmath67 .",
    "the method adopted , which works for a wide class of polygons , is that used for the generation of algebraic cubature points in @xcite , where the trapezoidal panels are obtained simply by orthogonal projection of the sides on a fixed reference line ( observe that the points cluster at the sides and at the line ) .     for a convex and a nonconvex polygon.,title=\"fig : \" ]    for a convex and a nonconvex polygon.,title=\"fig : \" ]",

    "if the determinant is non - zero then we may form the so - called fundamental lagrange interpolating polynomials @xmath131 indeed , then for any @xmath132 the polynomial ( of degree @xmath7 ) @xmath133 interpolates @xmath134 at the points of @xmath135 i.e. , @xmath136 @xmath137 a set of points @xmath138 which maximize @xmath139 as a function of @xmath135 are called fekete points of degree @xmath7 for @xmath3 and have the special property that @xmath140 ( and hence lebesgue constant bounded by @xmath141 ) and provide a very good ( often excellent ) set of interpolation points for @xmath142 however , they are typically very difficult to compute , even for moderate values of @xmath143    for any @xmath6 determining subset @xmath9 ( thought of as a sufficiently good discrete model of @xmath3 ) the algorithm introduced by sommariva and vianello in @xcite and studied by bos and levenberg in @xcite selects , in a simple and efficient manner , a subset @xmath144 of approximate fekete points , and hence provides a practical alternative to _ true _ fekete points , @xmath145 the optimization problem is nonlinear , and large - scale already for moderate values of @xmath7 , but the algorithm is able to give an approximate solution using only standard tools of numerical linear algebra .",
    "we sketch here the algorithm , in a matlab - like notation .",
    "the goal is extracting a maximum volume square submatrix from the rectangular @xmath146 vandermonde matrix @xmath147_{p\\in { \\cal b}_n,{{\\boldsymbol}{a}}\\in a_n}\\;,\\ ] ] where the polynomial basis and the array of points have been ( arbitrarily ) ordered .",

    "then , we can extract the approximate fekete points @xmath157 the algorithm can be conveniently implemented by the well - known qr factorization with column pivoting , originally proposed by businger and golub in 1965 @xcite , and used for example by the matlab `` mldivide '' or `` @xmath158 '' operator in the solution of underdetermined linear systems ( via the lapack routine dgeqp3 , cf .",
