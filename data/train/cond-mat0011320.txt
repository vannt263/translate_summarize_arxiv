    "spin ladder systems have been studied extensively over the past decade.@xcite there are reasons why the ladders have attracted so much attention .",
    "firstly , they naturally interpolate one- and two - dimensional systems and may provide some hints to better understand the high - temperature superconductivity which occurs in square lattice @xmath5 planes .",
    "secondly , spin ladders themselves have interesting physics and deserve through investigation in their own right .",
    "one of their most surprising properties is that low - energy physics of spin ladders depends drastically on the number of legs .",
    "spin-@xmath6 antiferromagnetic ( af ) ladders , for example , have a finite gap in the spin excitation spectrum in the even - leg case , whereas they have no gap in the odd - leg case .",
    "the ground state of an even - leg ladder is a spin singlet and its properties can be understood from the short - range resonating - valence - bond picture.@xcite this spin - gap behavior has been observed experimentally on @xmath0 two - leg ladder compounds,@xcite such as @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "a gapless phase can appear in even - leg ladders when an external field @xmath9 is applied . if the field @xmath9 is larger than a critical field @xmath10 , which is equal to the spin gap , and if it is smaller than the saturation field @xmath11 , then the ground state has a nonzero magnetization @xmath3 and the energy gap between the ground state and the first - excited states vanishes .",
    "the gapless mode has been shown to be described as a tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) liquid both in the strong- and weak - coupling limit,@xcite where the coupling in the rung - direction @xmath12 is much larger or much smaller than the one in the leg - direction @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "however , the @xmath3 dependence of the tl - liquid parameter @xmath2 , which governs the spin correlations in long wave length , has been obtained analytically only in the strong - coupling limit and it remains as a nontrivial problem to determine @xmath2 for general @xmath14 . in the gapless",
    "phase the system shows incommensurate spin correlations since the fermi wavenumber of jordan - wigner fermions is shifted from @xmath15 in the presence of the magnetic field which acts as a chemical potential for the fermions .",
    "the wavenumber @xmath16 characterizing the incommensurability of the gapless mode varies continuously as @xmath9 increases .",
    "this gapless incommensurate ( ic ) phase is in fact in the same universality class as the one - dimensional @xmath17 @xmath1 model in a magnetic field , as we will see .    in this paper",
    ", we study low - energy properties of the @xmath17 two - leg af ladder in the gapless ic regime for broad range of @xmath18 .",
    "we show that the system is a tl liquid for arbitrary @xmath18 and determine the @xmath3 dependence of @xmath2 numerically . to this end , we compute numerically the ground - state spin - correlation functions and the local magnetization in the open ladders using the density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) method  @xcite and extract the tl - liquid parameter by fitting the data to correlation functions obtained from the abelian bosonization .",
    "this method was applied in our previous work  @xcite to the @xmath0 @xmath1 chain at @xmath19 and proved to be effective in determining both the tl - liquid parameter and amplitudes of correlation functions . in order to demonstrate the validity of the analysis in the gapless ic phase , we first apply it to the @xmath17 @xmath1 chain for @xmath20 .",
    "the model is exactly solvable by the bethe ansatz and the tl - liquid parameter @xmath2 can be calculated for arbitrary value of @xmath3 .",
    "it thus provides a good test ground to check accuracy of our method .",
    "we find that @xmath2 estimated from the dmrg data is in excellent agreement with the exact calculation .",
    "we then apply the same method to the two - leg ladders in a magnetic field .",
    "our numerical data of correlation functions are fitted well for broad range of @xmath14 to the formulas based on the bosonization approach , confirming that the gapless modes are in fact in the universality class of a tl liquid for arbitrary @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath3 dependence of @xmath2 obtained in the large @xmath14 limit agrees with the analytic result obtained through mapping to the @xmath1 chain . in this limit @xmath2 is less than 1 for @xmath21 .",
    "as @xmath14 decreases , @xmath2 increases and become larger than 1 for intermediate values of @xmath3 .",
