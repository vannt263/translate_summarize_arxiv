    "variable stars were found in it by baade & hubble ( 1939 ) and thackeray ( 1950 ) confirmed that these were mainly rr lyrae variables . establishing the nature of these variables was important for baade s general concept of populations i and ii ( see letter from baade to thackeray 1950 mar 27 in feast 2000 ) .",
    "further work on the variables was carried out by van agt ( 1978 ) and kaluzny et al .",
    "most of the variables are rr lyrae stars but van agt also discovered some red variables one of which we show below to be a mira variable .",
    "carbon stars were discovered in the system by azzopardi , lequeux & westerlund ( 1985 , 1986 ) , while frogel et al .",
    "( 1982 ) reported another three possible examples .",
    "in more recent times the system has been extensively studied for stellar chemical abundances ( e.g. coleman et al .",

    "sculptor is believed to contain a predominantly old population but with a small population of age @xmath2 gyr and less ( revaz et al .",
    "2009 , especially their fig . 13 ) .",
    "work by various authors has shown that there is a large range in [ fe / h ] .",

    "there is evidence of a metallicity gradient in the galaxy with the more metal strong stars preferentially concentrated to the centre ( see tolstoy et al .",

    "observations were made with the sirius camera on the japanese - south african infrared survey facility ( irsf ) at saao , sutherland .",
    "the camera produces simultaneous @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 images covering an approximately @xmath8 arcmin square field ( after dithering ) with a scale of 0.45 arcsec / pixel .",
    "images were obtained on a @xmath9 grid centred on the nominal centre of the galaxy , 01:00:06 , 33:44:13 ( 2000.0 ) ( van agt 1978 ) . with overlaps between adjacent fields , the area observed was approximately 35 arcmin squared .",
    "an additional field was included later to allow one of the carbon stars ( alw1 ) to be observed .",
    "images were obtained at 25 epochs spread over 4 years in the central 9 fields , and between 16 and 20 epochs in the remaining fields . in each field , 10 dithered frames were combined after flat - fielding and dark and sky subtraction .",
    "exposure times were either 30 or 20s for each frame , depending on the seeing and on the brightness of the sky in the @xmath7 band .",
    "photometry was performed using dophot ( schechter et al .",
    "1993 ) in ` fixed - position ' mode , using the best - seeing @xmath6-band image in each field as templates .",
    "aladin was used to correct the coordinate system on each template and ra and dec were determined for each measured star .",
    "this allowed a cross - correlation to be made with the 2mass catalogue ( cutri et al .",
    "2003 ) , and photometric zero points were determined by comparison of our photometry with that of 2mass . in each field , stars in common with the 2mass catalogue with photometric quality a in each colour were identified and the irsf zero point was adjusted to match that of 2mass .",
    "the mean number of common stars per field was 12 and the mean standard deviation over all fields of the differences between irsf and 2mass are 0.04 mag in @xmath5 and @xmath6 and 0.06 mag in @xmath7 .",
    "no account was taken of possible colour transformations , such as in kato et al .",
    "those transformations were derived using highly reddened objects to define the red end and it is not obvious that the same transformations will apply to carbon stars .",

    "a broadly similar trend of period with age is found amongst the longer period carbon - rich miras .",
    "thus galactic kinematics ( feast et al .",
    "2006 ) indicates an age of @xmath44 gyr for carbon - rich miras of period @xmath45 days with some indication of an increasing period with decreasing age . there is a mira with a period of 450 days in ngc 1783 for which milone et al .",
    "( 2009 ) give an age of @xmath46 gyr , and if a carbon - rich mira of period 680 days is a member of an lmc cluster ( van loon et al .",
    "2003 ) its age is @xmath47 gyr .",
    "it is likely that there will be a range in periods at a given age .",
    "how large this is is not precisely known . the cluster ngc 1978 ( age @xmath2 gyr ( milone et al .",
    "2009 ) ) contains two carbon - rich miras for which kamath et al . ( 2010 ) give periods of 376 and 458 days , while nishida et al .",
    "give 491 days for the second star .",
    "in ngc  419 there are also two miras ( periods 488 and 738 days ( kamath et al 2010 ) for the first of which nishida et al",
    ". give a period of 526 days ) .",
    "the mean age of this cluster is @xmath46 gyr though there appears to have been an extended period of star formation in it ( rubele , kerber & girardi 2010 ) , which seems a common phenomenon in intermediate age clusters in the magellanic clouds ( milone et al .",
    "2009 ) . a more detailed discussion of the evolution of agb variables will be given elsewhere , but it will be clear that mira variables with periods @xmath48 days and lying on the pl relations with @xmath49 mag are far below the rgb tip of clusters such as ngc1978 and must presumably have evolved from lower mass ( older ) stars .",
    "table  [ tab_abund ] lists the periods of the miras in the four local group galaxies we have so far studied .",
    "all these miras are known to be , or are very likely to be carbon rich .",
    "we can now ask how consistent are these local group results with the period  age correlation just described .    consider first the long period miras ( @xmath50 days ) . these imply a significant population of a few gyr age in all the systems .",
    "this is consistent with other evidence for phoenix , leo  i and fornax .    in phoenix",
    "there is evidence of significant star formation in the age range 1 to 5 gyr ( see , e.g. young et al .",
    "2007 , fig .  6 ) and a lower rate between 5 and 10 gyr . in leo",
    "i the star formation rate is relatively high in this same age range ( e.g. dolphin 2002 , fig .",
    "15 ) . in fornax , too , there is significant star formation in this age range ( e.g. coleman & de jong 2000 , fig .",
    "the case of sculptor is particularly interesting in that it is frequently said to have only a very old population .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of a 554-day carbon - rich mira indicates a significant population of age @xmath51 gyr .",
    "interestingly , the model of revaz et al .",
    "( 2009 , fig .",
    "13 ) does in fact show a small population in the 0 - 2 gyr age range",
    ". earlier work ( tolstoy et al . 2001 , fig .",
    "14 ) had this population at @xmath52 gyr .    in both leo  i and fornax",
    "there has been significant star formation over the whole period , 1  12 gyr .",
    "thus , the range of mira periods found in these galaxies is expected if period depends on age .",
    "this does not itself establish an age ",
    "period relation .",
    "however , as was previously pointed out ( menzies et al .",
    "2010 ) two of the leo  i miras fall in the outer parts of the galaxy where , as shown by mateo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , stars on the extended agb are rare and where the main stellar population is older than in the inner parts .",
    "these two stars have periods of 191 and 283 days and are among the shorter period stars as we would expect for an older population .",
    "sculptor is particularly interesting in this regard .",
    "although , as we have just seen , the presence of a 554-day mira is consistent with the small @xmath53 gyr population of the model , there is no evidence of an intermediate population between that and the main population at @xmath54 gyr and older .",
    "since the evidence points against a carbon - rich mira of 189 day period belonging to a young population we must assign it to this old population .",
    "carbon stars in the galactic halo are considered to be either intermediate age stars belonging to infalling streams or else old , low mass objects in binaries that have acquired their carbon from an initially more massive companion .",
    "this latter mechanism is reasonable since only a relatively low percentage of halo giants are carbon rich .",
    "this does not seem to be a viable explanation for the short period carbon - rich miras in the dwarf spheroidals unless there are undetected short period oxygen - rich miras in them , which is very unlikely . evolutionary models of low mass stars do not usually produce carbon stars ( e.g. iben & renzini 1983 ) .",
    "the exact details of the mass and metallicity at which carbon stars do form depends on the models and we note that recent work ( e.g. karakas 2010 ; suda & fujimoto 2010 ) suggests that low mass stars with low metallicity may become carbon rich .",
    "it is also of interest to note that whereas the intermediate age 554-day mira is centrally located in sculptor , the old 189 day one is outside the main concentration of stars in the galaxy .",
    "a similar mira in phoenix , with period 425 days , is only about 1.3 arcmin from the centre of that galaxy , compared with the overall extent of about 8.7 arcmin ( van de rydt et al . 1991 ) .",
    "the relative numbers of miras in the various galaxies is roughly what we might expect from the total luminosities of the galaxies and estimates of the age distribution of their stars .",
    "thus , data in amorisco & evans ( 2010 ) suggest the total luminosities of fornax and leo  i are @xmath55 and @xmath56 in units of @xmath57 solar luminosities and both have had ongoing star formation from early times until quite recently",
    ". however , the intermediate age population is relatively stronger compared to the very old population in leo  i than in fornax ( e.g. dolphin 2002 , fig .",
    "15 ; revaz 2009 , fig .",
    "thus the roughly equal number of miras is understandable .",
    "sculptor is less luminous ( @xmath58 in the same units , ) while phoenix has a similar luminosity , and one expects fewer miras in these galaxies .",
    "both have a dominant old population and another increase in star formation later ( @xmath59 gyr in the case of phoenix , @xmath60 gyr in the case of sculptor ( young et al . 2007 ; revaz et al .",
    "2009 ) , though with the old population being relatively stronger in the case of sculptor . within the constraints of small number statistics",
    "these results for miras in local group galaxies are consistent with a general period  age relation for miras and the known properties of the galaxies .",
    "the extent to which agb stars produce dust at low metallicities is of importance among other things for an understanding of dust formation in the early universe .",
    "there is a general expectation that , other things being equal , the dust production in oxygen - rich agb stars will decrease with decreasing metallicity since the amount of available material will decrease . in agb carbon stars , however , this restriction does not necessarily apply since fresh carbon is transported to the stellar atmosphere by dredge - up .",
    "tests of these expectations using observations in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds have not been entirely conclusive ( see sloan et al . 2008 ; van loon et al .",
    "nevertheless , this and our other papers on dwarf spheroidals have shown the presence of carbon miras with thick dust shells in metal - poor systems . furthermore , sloan et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have used spitzer space telescope spectra to deduce that sculptor mag29 is producing significant amounts of dust and have suggested on this basis that evolved low metallicity stars may make a significant contribution to dust production in the early universe .    our present discovery that this star is a long period mira allows us to further discuss this matter together with our work on miras in other dwarf spheroidals . on the basis of the discussion of the last section , mag29 , with a period of 554 days , will be a member of the younger population in sculptor .",
    "this has a mean metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath61 ( tolstoy et al . ) .",
    "this star is similar to the longest period mira in leo  i , with a period of 523 days , and is thus of similar age .",
    "gullieuszik et al .",
    "( 2009 ) find from ca ii triplet observations of red giants that leo  i has a rather small dispersion in metal abundance , with [ m / h]= 1.2 , which they take as equivalent to [ fe / h ] = 1.4 and thus similar to that inferred for mag29 .",
    "we have already shown ( menzies at al .",
    "2010 ) that this star has a significant dust shell since , whilst it fits an @xmath31log p relation , it is too faint , due to shell absorption , for a @xmath30log p relation .",
    "the difference between the apparent moduli for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 relations gives an indication of the optical depth of the shell .",
    "for the leo  i star it is 0.8 mag whereas for mag29 it is 0.4 mag indicating a thicker shell in the case of the leo  i mira .",
    "there are other miras in both leo  i and fornax with similar thick shells indicating high mass - loss . evidently mag29 is not particularly exceptional in this regard .",
    "it is worth noting that in comparing mass - loss rates in different stellar systems it is important to consider similar types of objects .",
    "at least in the case of oxygen - rich miras the mean mass - loss rate is a function of both luminosity ( i.e. period ) and pulsation amplitude ( whitelock et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "groenewegen , lanon & marescaux ( 2009 ) have drawn attention to the great strength of the 1.53 @xmath62 m band of c@xmath63h@xmath63 ( acetylene ) band in mag29 .",
    "sloan et al .",
    "have discussed the bands of this molecule at 7.5 and 13.7 @xmath62 m in mag29 and connect their strength with the low metallicity .",
    "the 1.53 @xmath62 m band is known from the work of joyce ( 1998 ) to vary strongly with pulsation phase in the 421-day carbon - rich mira v  cyg and comparing his results with the aavso light curve shows it to be very strong near minimum light .",
    "our infrared light curves show that mag29 was near maximum light when the data of both groenewegen et al . and sloan et al .",
    "were obtained implying unusual strength compared with stars so far observed in this region .",
    "however , we might expect it to be of similar strength in long - period , dust - enshrouded miras in other local group systems .",
    "it is thus clear that carbon - rich miras can produce significant amounts of dust in metal - poor systems .",
    "however , it is important to realize that the carbon - rich miras in the dwarf spheroidals we have discussed are , judging from their periods ( @xmath64 days ) , too old ( @xmath29 1 gyr ) and of too low initial mass ( @xmath65 ) to be directly relevant to the early universe . at the metallicities of our galaxy or the lmc , miras with intermediate initial masses and ages of relevance for the early universe ( periods @xmath66 days )",
    "are not carbon rich .",
    "this is attributed to hot bottom burning which turns the carbon into nitrogen .",
    "nevertheless , theory ( e.g. karakas 2010 ) suggests that at much lower metallicities , intermediate mass agb stars do have @xmath67 and will thus be carbon stars .",
    "infrared monitoring of sculptor over a four year period has led to the following results : + ( 1 ) a comparison with spectroscopically measured abundances shows that the width of the giant branch is primarily due to a metallicity spread with extreme metal poor stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath68 3.4 ) on the extreme blue side of the branch .",
    "+ ( 2 ) apart from the two variables discovered , the known carbon stars in the galaxy all lie below the trgb .",
    "this contrasts with the situation in other dwarf spheroidal galaxies . however , an isochrone with [ fe / h ] @xmath69 and an age of 2 gyr ( marigo et al .",
    "2008 ) has an abundance ratio c / o @xmath28 1 extending down to the luminosities of these stars .",
    "+ ( 3 ) two carbon - rich miras are present in sculptor and give a mean distance modulus of 19.38 mag based on an lmc modulus of 18.39 mag . + ( 4 ) a general discussion of the relation of mira periods to age , together with other evidence leads to the conclusion that the 554-day period mira in sculptor belongs to the small population with an age of @xmath29 2 gyr whilst the 189-day mira belongs to the dominant population of age @xmath29 10 gyr . +",
    "( 5 ) the 554-day mira is identical with the star mag29 which has been previously discussed from spitzer space telescope spectra as a low metallicity star with heavy mass loss . using our previous work",
    "we find that there are several carbon - rich miras in other metal - poor dwarf spheroidals with similarly thick circumstellar shells . whilst this appears to strengthen the suggestion of sloan et al .",
    "( 2009 ) that low - metallicity carbon stars could make a significant contribution to dust formation in the early universe , this depends on whether young , high - mass agb stars can become carbon - rich .",
    "this research has made use of aladin .",
