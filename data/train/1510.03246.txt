    "the aim of this paper is to compare two geometric invariants of riemannian manifolds : critical exponent and volume entropy .",
    "the first one is defined through the action of the fundamental group on the universal cover , the second one is defined for compact manifolds as the exponential growth rate of the volume of balls in the universal cover .",
    "these two invariants have been studied in many cases , we pursue this study for quasi - fuchsian manifolds .",
    "let @xmath1 be a group acting on a simply connected riemannian manifold @xmath2 .",
    "if the action on @xmath3 is discrete we define the _ critical exponent _ by @xmath4    where @xmath5 is any point in @xmath3 .",
    "it does not depends on this particular base point thanks to triangular inequality . if we want to insist on the space on which @xmath1 acts we will write @xmath6 .",

    "we will also use the notation @xmath13 for simply connected manifolds @xmath3 as the exponential growth rate of its balls .",
    "volume entropy coincides with the critical exponent of @xmath14 acting on @xmath15 .    moreover , a famous theorem of g. besson , g. courtois and s. gallot @xcite said that the entropy allows to distinguish hyperbolic metric in the set of all metrics , @xmath16 .",
    "remark that entropy is sensitive to homothetic transformations : for any @xmath17 we have @xmath18 .",
    "assume that @xmath12 admits an hyperbolic metric @xmath19 and let @xmath20 be the set of metrics on @xmath12 whose volume is equal to @xmath21 , then besson , courtois , gallot s theorem says for all @xmath22 : @xmath23 with equality if and only if @xmath24 .",
    "+ our aim is to study the behavior of the volume entropy for a subset of all the metrics on a surface .",
    "this subset is the metrics induced by an incompressible embedding into a quasi - fuchsian manifolds .",
    "it has not the cone structure of @xmath16 : it is not invariant by all homothetic transformations .",
    "hence we will look at the behavior of @xmath7 without normalization by the volume .",
    "+ let @xmath25 be a compact surface of genus @xmath26 and @xmath27 its fundamental group .",
    "a fuchsian representation of @xmath1 is a faithful and discrete representation in @xmath28 .",
    "a quasi - fuchsian representation is a perturbation of fuchsian representation in @xmath29 .",
    "more precisely it is a discrete and faithfull representations of @xmath1 into @xmath30 , such that the limit set on @xmath31 is a jordan curve .",
    "a celebrated theorem of r. bowen @xcite , asserts that for quasi - fuchsian representations , critical exponent is minimal and equal to @xmath32 if and only if the representation is fuchsian .",

    "the critical exponent for these two actions of @xmath1 are then equal @xmath39    in light of this trivial example , two questions rise up .",
    "what is the entropy of a @xmath1 invariant disk which is not totally geodesic ?",
    "what happens when we modify the fuchsian representation in @xmath29 ?",
    "we will answer to the first question . since @xmath40 is a fuchsian representation ,",
    "the critical exponent of @xmath1 acting on @xmath0 through @xmath36 is @xmath32 , and we have the following    [ th - main fuchsian ] let @xmath12 be a @xmath1 invariant disk embedded in @xmath0 .",
    "we have @xmath41 equality occurs if and only if @xmath12 is the totally geodesic hyperbolic plane preserved by @xmath1 .",
    "remarks that @xmath42 , hence the last theorem can be rewritten as follow :    for all metrics @xmath43 obtained as induced metrics by an incompressible embedding in a fuchsian manifold we have @xmath44 with equality",
    "if and only if @xmath24 .    we _ did not _",
    "renormalize by the volume , this explains the dichotomy between ( [ eq -bcg ] ) and ( [ eq - inverse de bcg sans normalisation ] ) . + we will prove this theorem in the next section .",
    "the inequality is trivial since the induce distance between two points is always greater than the distance in @xmath0 : @xmath45 , but the rigidity is not .",
    "we have no geometrical ( curvature ) hypothesis on @xmath12 , therefore it is not obvious at all to show that the inequality is strict as soon as @xmath12 is not totally geodesic .",
    "indeed we can not use the `` usual '' techniques of negative curvature like bowen - margulis measure , or even the uniqueness of geodesic between two points .",
    "we obtain an answer to the second question under a geometrical hypothesis on the curvature :    [ th - main qf ] let @xmath1 be a quasi - fuchsian group and @xmath46 a @xmath47invariant embedded disk .",
    "we suppose that @xmath12 endowed with the induced metric has negative curvature .",
    "we then have @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the geodesic intersection between @xmath12 and @xmath0 .",
    "moreover the inequality occurs if and only if the length spectrum of @xmath50 is proportional to the one of @xmath51 .",
    "the _ geodesic intersection _ will be defined in section [ sec - geodesic intersection ] .",
    "roughly it is the average ratio of the length between two points of @xmath12 for the extrinsic and intrinsic distance .",
    "we need the curvature assumption to define and use this invariant .    as a corollary of theorem [ th - main qf",
    "] , we obtain    under the assumptions of theorem [ th - main qf ] we have @xmath52 with equality if and only if @xmath1 is fuchsian and @xmath12 is the totally geodesic hyperbolic plane , preserved by @xmath1 .",
    "theorem [ th - main qf ] has to be compared to results obtained by g. knieper who compared entropy for two different metrics on the same manifolds and our proof of theorem [ th - main qf ] follows his paper @xcite .",
    "it is also related to the work of m. bridgeman and e. taylor @xcite , indeed we answer by the negative to question 2 of their paper .",
    "finally , u. hamenstadt looked in @xcite at the geodesic intersection between the boundary of convex hull and @xmath0 for quasi - fuchsian manifolds .",
    "as we said , the two proofs are very different one from each others . for the fuchsian case ,",
    "we give precise estimates for the length of some paths of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "we show that in some sense the length between two points on @xmath12 is much greater than the extrinsic distance between those two points . for quasi - fuchsian manifolds , we use well known techniques of negative curvature geometry :",
    "we compare the patterson sullivan measures for @xmath0 and for @xmath12 .",
    "in this section we are going to prove theorem [ th - main fuchsian ] .",
    "this theorem has a strong condition on @xmath1 , ie .",
    "it is conjugate to a subgroup of @xmath28 but we make no geometrical assumptions on @xmath12 . as we said ,",
    "there could be more than one geodesic between two points on @xmath12 .",
    "we already remarked that the inequality is trivial , as is the equality when @xmath12 is totally geodesic .",
    "therefore , the only thing left to prove is the strict inequality when @xmath12 is not totally geodesic or in other words if @xmath53 then @xmath54 .    the proof of the theorem",
    "is based on the comparison between the distances on equidistant surfaces of the totally geodesic @xmath1-invariant hyperbolic plane .",
    "we are going to prove several lemmas which together gives theorem [ th - main fuchsian ] .",
    "the strict inequality follows directly from [ lem - h(sigma)<delta(d , dm ) ] and [ lem- delta dm < 1-delta ] .",
    "we denote by @xmath55 the totally geodesic , @xmath1-invariant plane .",
    "the induced metric on @xmath55 is the usual hyperbolic metric , and we will denote it by @xmath33 .",
    "we are first going to see that between all the equidistant surfaces , @xmath33 has the biggest entropy .",
    "then we will make this argument work when only one part of the surface is `` above '' @xmath55 . the idea to prove it , is to consider another distance @xmath56 on @xmath55 , which will be used as an intermediary between @xmath12 and @xmath33 .",
    "we will explain , after the definition of @xmath56 how the two comparisons will be proved .",
    "let us begin to parametrize @xmath57 by @xmath58 as follows : take an orientation for the unit normal tangent space of @xmath33 , then to a point @xmath59 we associate orthogonal projection on @xmath33 thi is the first parameter of the parametrization .",
    "the oriented distance along this geodesic gives the second one .",
    "we call @xmath60 the projection from @xmath57 to @xmath61 .",
    "hence the parametrisation , called fermi coordinates , is the defined by @xmath62 where the @xmath63 is the oriented distance by the choice of the orientation on the unit normal tangent of @xmath33 . with this parametrization ,",
    "the metric on @xmath0 is @xmath64    look at @xmath65 the equidistant disk at distance @xmath66 of @xmath33 , its metric , induces by the one on @xmath0 is @xmath67 .",
    "it is isometric to a hyperbolic plane of curvature @xmath68 , and its volume entropy is @xmath69 , hence the entropy is maximal if and only if @xmath70 . for the general case",
    ", we are going to refined this argument showing that it is sufficient that a small part of @xmath12 is over @xmath33 for the entropy to be strictly less than @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath12 be a embedded @xmath1-invariant disk in @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that @xmath71 , and we endowed @xmath12 with its induced metric .",
    "let @xmath72 be two points on @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath73 be a geodesic on @xmath12 linking @xmath74 to @xmath75 .",
    "we parametrize @xmath73 by its fermi coordinates , @xmath76 .",
    "we then have @xmath77 we now endowed @xmath55 with another distance than the one coming from hyperbolic metric .",
    "it will play the role of intermediary to compare @xmath78 on @xmath12 with@xmath79 on @xmath33 .",
    "we call @xmath80 the restriction of @xmath60 on @xmath12 .",
    "since @xmath81 , there exists @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 such that @xmath85 this means that _ all _ the points in the pre - image of @xmath86 by @xmath80 are at distance greater than @xmath87 from @xmath55 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath88 is smaller than the injectivity radius of @xmath89 in order that the translations of @xmath86 by @xmath1 are disjoint .",
    "we now consider on @xmath55 the metric @xmath90 defined by putting weight on the translations of @xmath86 by @xmath1 .",
    "we define @xmath90 by @xmath91 on @xmath92 . and",
    ".    we will index by @xmath94 objects which depends on this metric .",

    "the comparison whit the entropy of @xmath12 is quite easy and follows quickly from the definition of @xmath56 and the inequality ( [ eq- evaluation distance ] ) .",
    "the comparison with the entropy of @xmath33 is more subtle .",
    "indeed , there exists geodesic of @xmath33 which are geodesic for @xmath99 ( any lift of a closed geodesic which does not cross the ball @xmath100 ) on @xmath89 ) .",
    "we will first prove that two points of @xmath55 which are joined by a geodesic of @xmath33 which crosses often @xmath101 are much farther away from each other for @xmath56 distance , cf lemme [ lem -clef ] .",
    "then , we will use a large deviation theorem for the geodesic flow ( theorem [ th large deviation sur les vecteurs ] ) , to show that there are few geodesic which does not cross @xmath101 ( lemme [ lem il existe o tel que theta(eo ( r ) est petit ] ) .",
    "it will follow from these two results that the balls of radius @xmath11 for @xmath56 are almost completely included in balls of radius @xmath102 of @xmath33 for @xmath103 ( lemma [ lem- delta dm < 1-delta ] ) .",
    "the two comparisons give the proof of theorem [ th - main fuchsian ] .    the comparison between @xmath104 and the critical exponent of @xmath99 follows from the inequality [ eq- evaluation distance ] and the definition of @xmath56    [ lem - h(sigma)<delta(d , dm ) ] we have @xmath105",
