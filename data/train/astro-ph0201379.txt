    "the observed characteristics of known quasars are remarkably similar over a broad range of redshift .",
    "for example , x - ray studies utilizing the rosat database @xcite , show little variation of the ratio of x - ray to optical flux for optically selected quasars . also , the rest frame uv spectra of quasars , including the broad ly@xmath9 , nv and civ emission lines , are nearly identical for a large range of redshift and present no evidence for subsolar metallicities even up to a @xmath10 @xcite .    even though the individual properties of quasars are similar , the co - moving space density of quasars changes drastically with redshift . at high",
    "redshift ( @xmath7 ) , a significant dropoff in the co - moving space density of quasars seen in optical ( e.g. , schmidt et al . 1995 ; warren et al . 1994 ; osmer 1982 ) and radio surveys @xcite hints at either the detection of the onset of accretion onto supermassive black holes or a missed high - redshift population , possibly due to obscuration .",
    "x - ray selected quasars from rosat have been used to support the latter interpretation based on evidence for constant space densities beyond a redshift of 2 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the rosat sample size is small with only 8 quasars beyond a redshift of 3 .",
    "significant numbers of quasars with @xmath7 are being amassed to investigate both their intrinsic properties and the evolutionary behavior of the quasar population .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) reports 123 optically selected quasars with @xmath7 @xcite . however , optical surveys suffer from selection effects due to intrinsic obscuration and the intervening ly@xmath9 forest .",
    "current x - ray surveys with chandra and xmm do not have a strong selection effect based on redshift and can detect emission up to 10  kev ( observed frame ) to reveal hidden populations of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) including heavily obscured quasars @xcite .",
    "high-@xmath11 objects can be detected through a larger intrinsic absorbing column of gas and dust because the observed - frame x - ray bandpass corresponds to higher energy , more penetrating x - rays at the source .",
    "( wilman & fabian 1999 ) . ] therefore , optical and x - ray surveys will complement each other , providing a fair census of mass accretion onto black holes at high redshift .",
    "larger samples of x - ray observations of @xmath7 quasars are needed since there are currently only 24 @xcite , of which only 3 are x - ray selected quasars .",
    "chandra and xmm - newton are beginning to probe faint flux levels for the first time to detect the high-@xmath11 quasar population .",
    "initial chandra and xmm - newton observations of optically selected quasars have shown a systematically lower x - ray flux relative to the optical at high redshift @xcite .    in this paper , we present the x - ray and optical properties of a newly discovered , x - ray selected @xmath0 quasar with the chandra observatory .",
    "this quasar is the highest redshift object published , x - ray selected quasar detected in the cdf - n was presented at the 199th aas meeting ( brandt 2001b ) . ] from an x - ray survey .",
    "these results are a component of the chandra multiwavelength project ( champ ; wilkes et al .",
    "2001 ) . a primary aim of the champ is to measure the intrinsic luminosity function of quasars and lower luminosity agn out to @xmath8 .",
    "the survey will provide a medium - depth , wide - area sample of serendipitous x - ray sources from archival chandra fields in cycles  1 and 2 covering @xmath12 deg@xmath13 .",
    "the broadband sensitivity between 0.38.0 kev enables the selection to be far less affected by absorption than previous optical , uv , or soft x - ray surveys .",
    "chandra s small point spread function ( @xmath141@xmath15 resolution on - axis ) and low background allow sources to be detected to fainter flux levels , while the @xmath16 x - ray astrometry greatly facilitates unambiguous optical identification of x - ray counterparts .",
    "the project will effectively bridge the gap between flux limits achieved with the chandra deep field observations and those of past rosat surveys .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume h@xmath17=50 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 and a flat cosmology with q@xmath17=0.5 .",
    "the x - ray source cxompj213945.0 - 234655 ( seq .",
    "800104 ) was observed on november 18 , 1999 by chandra @xcite with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - i ; nousek et al .",
    "1998 ) in the field of the x - ray cluster ms  2137.3 - 2353 ( m. wise , pi ) .",
    "we have used data reprocessed ( in april 2001 ) at cxc .",
    "we then ran a detection algorthim xpipe @xcite which was specifically designed for the champ to produce a uniform and high quality source catalog .",
    "cxompj213945.0 - 234655 is one of 72 sources detected using ciao/ ( freeman et al .",
    "2002 ) within the acis configuration ( figure  [ image ] ) .",
    "the 41  ksec observation yielded a net 16.7@xmath187.5 counts within the soft bandpass ( 0.32.5 kev ) and no counts in the hard bandpass ( 2.58.0 kev ) .",
    "this corresponds to a galactic absorption corrected , observed frame x - ray flux of @xmath19 kev)=2.82 @xmath20 erg  cm^-2  s^-1erg  @xmath21  s@xmath2(table 1 ) .",
    "the source naming convention of the champ ( cxompjhhmmss.s@xmath18ddmmss ) is given with a prefix cxomp ( chandra x - ray observatory multiwavelength project ) and affixed with the truncated j2000 position of the x - ray source after a mean field offset correction is applied , derived from the cross - correlation of optical and x - ray sources in each field .",
    "we obtained optical imaging of the field in three noao / ctio sdss filters ( @xmath3,@xmath22 and @xmath23 ; fukugita et al .",
    "1996 ) with the ctio 4m / mosaic on october 29 , 2000 as part of the champ optical identification program @xcite .",
    "integration time in each band ranged from 1215 minutes during seeing of 1.3@xmath151.8@xmath15 fwhm .",
    "image reduction was performed with the iraf(v2.11)/mscred package .",
    "we used sextractor @xcite to detect sources , and measure ( pixel ) positions and magnitudes .",
    "landolt standard stars were transformed to the sdss photometric system @xcite and used to calibrate the photometric solution . following the convention of the early data release of the sdss quasar catalog @xcite , we present the optical photometry here as @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 since the sdss photometry system is not yet finalized and the ctio filters are not a perfect match to the sdss filters .",
    "the limiting magnitudes for a point source are given as the mean of 3@xmath27 detections : @xmath24=26.18 , @xmath25=25.54 , @xmath26=25.11 .",
    "as evident from figure  [ image ] , there are three optical sources detected down to a limiting @xmath26 magnitude of 25.1 within the 50% encircled energy radius of the x - ray centroid .",
    "the two primary candidates , based on optical brightness , have offsets between the optical and x - ray positions of 1.87@xmath15 and 4.94@xmath15 . to determine whether either of these sources are the likely counterpart to the x - ray detection , we have determined errors associated with the x - ray astrometric solution .",
    "@xcite have carried out extensive simulations of point sources generated using the saosac raytrace program ( http://hea-www.harvard.edu/mst/ ) and detected using ciao/. for weak sources of @xmath28 counts between 8@xmath2910@xmath29 , off - axis from the aim point , the reported x - ray centroid position is correct within @xmath30 , corresponding to a @xmath31 confidence contour .",
    "therefore , the nearby optical source ( @xmath32r=1.9@xmath15 ) is the likely counterpart to the x - ray detection .",
    "the ( j2000 ) position of the optical counterpart as measured from the @xmath22 image referenced to the guide star catalog ii is @xmath33 .",
    "we obtained a low resolution optical spectrum of cxompj213945.0 - 234655 ( figure  [ spectra ] ) with the ctio 4m / hydra multi - fiber spectrograph on october 15 , 2001 .",
    "spectra of 17 of 22 optical counterparts to x - ray sources with a magnitude @xmath34 were acquired in a three hour integration within the chandra field .",
    "the spectrograph has 2@xmath15 diameter fibers and was configured with a 527 @xmath35/mm grating that provided @xmath142800  of spectral coverage with a resolution of @xmath144  .",
    "the sky background was measured using 81 fibers not assigned to the chandra x - ray detections within the 1@xmath36 field spectrograph .",
    "we processed the data using the iraf(v2.11)/hydra reduction package .",
    "an additional spectrum of the high redshift quasar ( figure  [ spectra ] ) and the optically brighter source 4.9 west of the chandra x - ray position were obtained on the following evening with the eso / ntt 3.5 m to verify the intriguing hydra spectrum and obtain greater wavelength coverage .",
    "a 300 @xmath35/mm grating was implemented with a wavelength coverage of 4000  and a resolution of @xmath1411  . due to poor weather conditions at the end of the evening",
    ", flux calibration was done using the standard star ltt 2415 observed the following night . from the ntt spectrum",
    ", we classify the brighter object as an m3 dwarf with no sign of emission lines , confirming the quasar as the optical counterpart of the x - ray source .",
    "we measured a mean redshift @xmath11=4.930 @xmath180.004 from the ly@xmath37+ovi , cii , siiv+oiv ] and civ emission lines in the ntt spectrum . using this redshift ,",
    "the ly@xmath9 line centroid is shifted by @xmath384  redward from the expected rest wavelength , probably due to significant hi absorption .",
    "this is similar to the mean shift of ly@xmath9 observed in a sample of 33 high redshift quasars by @xcite .",
    "the spectrum obtained at the ntt was used to measure the rest - frame equivalent widths of ly@xmath37/ovi ( @xmath39  ) , ly@xmath9+nv ( @xmath40  ) , and civ ( @xmath41  ) . for comparison",
    ", we also measured ly@xmath9+nv for 10 high redshift quasars in the range @xmath42 from the sdss spectra of anderson et al .",
    "this subsample has a similar mean redshift ( 4.91 ) , but with an average @xmath43 is 4.5x more optically luminous than cxompj213945.0 - 234655 . nevertheless , the mean rest - frame equivalent width of ly@xmath9+nv in the sdss subsample is consistent at 79  , with an rms dispersion of 27  .",
    "the poor s / n of the sdss spectra and the strong ly@xmath9 forest , prevent meaningful comparison of other line strengths .",
    "to compare the broad band spectral energy distribution of cxompj213945.0 - 234655 to other x - ray detected quasars , we have calculated @xmath9@xmath44 @xcite , the slope of a hypothetical powerlaw between the x - ray and optical flux .",
    "the rest - frame , monochromatic luminosity at 2 kev corresponding to the derived x - ray flux is log @xmath45 erg  s@xmath2  hz@xmath2 .",
    "assuming @xmath9=0.5 for the optical continuum powerlaw slope , we derive the rest - frame , monochromatic optical luminosity at 2500  from the @xmath26 magnitude to be log @xmath46 erg s@xmath2hz@xmath2 .",
    "we thus find @xmath47 .",
    "table 1 lists the measured x - ray and optical properties of cxompj213945.0 - 234655 .",
    "we compare the x - ray to optical flux ratio of cxompj213945.0 - 234655 to other @xmath7 quasars by plotting the observed - frame , galactic absorption corrected 0.52.0 kev x - ray flux versus the ab@xmath48 magnitude ( figure  [ aox ] ) .",
    "the plotted lines represent the locus of points for a hypothetical quasar with a wide range of luminosities and an @xmath49=1.6 @xmath180.15 @xcite , representative of the mean for quasars selected from the large bright quasar survey and detected in the rosat all - sky survey .",
    "the @xmath49 of cxompj213945.0 - 234655 is comparable with low redshift quasars in contrast to the x - ray faint chandra detections of optically selected quasars at @xmath504 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray weakness of the latter may be due to intrinsic absorption by large amounts of gas in the quasars host galaxies .",
    "x - ray and optical observations of cxompj213945.0 - 234655 show no direct evidence of significant obscuration .",
    "the optical color ( @xmath51 ) is consistent with optically selected quasars .",
    "we measured the mean color @xmath52 from 15 sdss quasars @xcite with @xmath53 to be 1.69 with rms dispersion of 0.30 .",
    "the upper limit to the x - ray hardness ratio ( @xmath54 ) hints at an unobscured x - ray spectrum , although a moderately absorbed component , if present , would be redshifted out of the chandra bandpass .",
    "x - ray selected samples may be less biased against absorbers ( both intrinsic and line - of - sight ) than are optically - selected samples , an advantage expected to be especially important at high redshifts . from our flux - calibrated ntt spectrum , we measure @xmath55 , the flux decrement caused by the ly@xmath9 forest ( oke & korycansky 1982 ) relative to an extrapolated power - law continuum relative to a @xmath56 power - law continuum normalized to the observed flux in the region @xmath57 in the rest - frame . we derive uncertainties by measuring against continua with slopes in the range @xmath58 . ] in the region between rest - frame limits @xmath59  .",
    "the value we measure of @xmath60 is between the @xmath61 measurement of 0.54 from rauch et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and the @xmath10 measurements of @xmath62 from 4 sdss quasars in becker et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . while cxompj213945.0 - 234655 thus appears consistent with the handful of bracketing measurements of optically - selected quasars",
    "( see also riediger et al .",
    "1998 ) , more high redshift x - ray selected quasars are needed to test possible biases caused by absorption .",
    "cxompj213945.0 - 234655 exemplifies the potential for the champ project to detect quasars with fluxes at the faint end of the @xmath63 parameter space ( figure  3 ) .",
    "this will allow the champ to acquire significant numbers of high redshift quasars .",
    "from the first year of spectroscopic followup of chandra x - ray sources to @xmath64 , we currently have 22 newly identified quasars with @xmath65 and eight with @xmath66 , approximately 23 such objects per field .",
    "nearly 5% of champ sources identified to date are @xmath66 quasars .",
    "we present the discovery of cxompj213945.0 - 234655 , at @xmath0 the most distant x - ray selected object published to date . with a measured optical to x - ray flux ratio @xmath49=1.52 ,",
    "cxompj213945.0 - 234655 is similar to low redshift quasars , in contrast to several optically - selected @xmath7 quasars previously detected by chandra .",
    "this detection highlights the importance of wide area , intermediate depth surveys like the champ for studies of the high redshift quasar population ( @xmath67 3 to 5 ) .",
    "the champ has begun to amass a sample of high redshift , x - ray selected quasars with the goal of measuring the cosmic evolution of accretion - powered sources relatively unhampered by the absorption and reddening that affects optical surveys .",
