    "our analysis will be mainly focused on the existence and properties of an optimal repayment strategy @xmath8 in feedback form .    in the alternative model proposed by nuo and thomas in @xcite",
    ", the yearly income @xmath9 is modeled as a stochastic process : @xmath10    here @xmath11 is an exponential growth rate , while @xmath12 denotes brownian motion on a filtered probability space . differently from @xcite , in @xcite it is the borrower himself that chooses when to declare bankruptcy .",
    "this decision will be taken when the debt - to - income ratio reaches a certain threshold @xmath1 , beyond which the burden of servicing the debt becomes worse than the cost of bankruptcy .    at the time @xmath13 when bankruptcy occurs , we assume that the borrower pays a fixed price @xmath14 , while lenders recover a fraction @xmath15 $ ] of their outstanding capital . here",
    "@xmath16 is a nondecreasing function of the debt size .",
    "for example , the borrower may hold an amount @xmath17 of collateral ( gold reserves , real estate@xmath18 ) which will be proportionally divided among creditors if bankruptcy occurs . in this case , when bankruptcy occurs each investor will receive a fraction @xmath19 of his outstanding capital .",
    "aim of the present paper is to provide a detailed mathematical analysis of some models closely related to @xcite .",
    "we stress that these problems are very different from a standard problem of optimal control .",
    "indeed , the interest rate charged by lenders is not given a priori .",
    "rather , it is determined by the expected evolution of the debt at all future times .",
    "hence it depends globally on the entire feedback control @xmath20 .",
    "a `` solution '' must be understood as a nash equilibrium , where the strategy implemented by the borrower represents the best reply to the strategy adopted by the lenders , and conversely .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows .",
    "* we first assume that value @xmath1 at which bankruptcy occurs is a priori given , and seek an optimal feedback control @xmath8 which minimizes the expected cost to the borrower . for any value @xmath21 of the diffusion coefficient in , we prove that the problem admits at least one nash equilibrium solution , in feedback form . in the deterministic case",
    "where @xmath22 , the solution can be constructed by concatenating solutions of a system of two odes , with terminal data given at @xmath23 . *",
    "* we then study how the expected total cost of servicing the debt together with the bankruptcy cost ( exponentially discounted in time ) , are affected by different choices of  @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath24 $ ] be the salvage rate , i.e. , the fraction of outstanding capital that will be payed back to lenders if bankruptcy occurs when the debt - to - income ratio is @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath25 then , letting @xmath26 , the total expected cost to the borrower goes to zero . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath27 then the total expected cost to the borrower remains uniformly positive as @xmath26 .",
    "we remark that the assumption is quite realistic .",
    "for example , if holds , then @xmath28 for all @xmath1 large enough .",
    "we remark that rules out the possibility of a _ ponzi scheme _",
    ", where the old debt is serviced by initiating more and more new loans . indeed , if holds , then such a strategy will cause the total debt to blow up to infinity in finite time .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we describe more carefully the model , deriving the equations satisfied by the value function @xmath29 and the discounted bond price @xmath30 . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we construct equilibrium solutions in feedback form , in the stochastic case ( @xmath31 ) and in the deterministic case ( @xmath22 ) , respectively .",
    "finally , sections 5 and 6 contain an analysis of how the expected cost to the borrower changes , depending on the bankruptcy threshold @xmath1 .",
    "in the economics literature , some related models of debt and bankruptcy can be found in @xcite . a general introduction to nash equilibria and",
    "differential games can be found in @xcite .",
    "for the basic theory of optimal control and viscosity solutions of hamilton - jacobi equations we refer to @xcite .",
    "we consider a slight variant of the model in @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath32 the total debt of a borrower ( a government , or a private company ) at time @xmath2 .",
    "the annual income @xmath9 of the borrower is assumed to be a random process , governed by the stochastic evolution equation .",
    "the debt is financed by issuing bonds . when an investor buys a bond of unit nominal value , he receives a continuous stream of payments with intensity @xmath33 . here",
    "* @xmath34 is the interest rate payed on bonds , which we assume coincides with the discount rate , * @xmath35 is the rate at which the borrower pays back the principal .",
    "if no bankruptcy occurs , the payoff for an investor will thus be @xmath36    in case of bankruptcy , a lender recovers only a fraction @xmath37 $ ] of his outstanding capital . here",

    "we call @xmath41 the rate of payments that the borrower chooses to make to his creditors , at time @xmath2 .",
    "if this amount is not enough to cover the running interest and pay back part of the principal , new bonds are issued , at the discounted price @xmath40 .",
    "the nominal value of the outstanding debt thus evolves according to @xmath42    the debt - to - income ratio is defined as @xmath43 . in view of and ( [ dx ] ) , ito s formula @xcite yields the stochastic evolution equation @xmath44\\ , dt - \\sigma \\,x(t)\\ , dw.\\ ] ]    here @xmath45 is the portion of the total income allocated to pay for the debt . throughout the following we assume @xmath46 .",
    "we observe that , if @xmath47 , then the borrower s income grows faster than the debt ( even if no payment is ever made ) . in this case , with probability one the debt - to - income ratio would approach zero as @xmath48 .",

    "@xmath2 he can decide the portion @xmath49 of the total income which he allocates to repay the debt .",
