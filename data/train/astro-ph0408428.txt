    "the morphological patterns of the large - scale structure in the universe are the consequence of the dynamical evolution of the universe , and thus provide important information on cosmology .",
    "the pattern of the clustering of galaxies is described in many ways .",
    "for example , @xcite indicated the picture of the hierarchical clustering , and @xcite indicated that of the cell structure .",
    "gott , melott , & dickinson ( 1986 ) ( hereafter gmd ) proposed a new picture , which is depicted by sponge - like topology of the universe . to capture the topology of the universe , it is useful to look at the three dimensional views of galaxy distributions ( einasto & miller 1983 ) .",
    "the clustering pattern is so complicated that it is difficult to fully describe the pattern by either the hierarchical picture or the cell picture alone .",
    "gmd showed that the large - scale structure of the universe has sponge - like topology by analyzing the cfa1 catalog of galaxies .",
    "they examined various cosmological models of the galaxy distribution and quantified the topology by the genus statistic .",
    "the cfa1 catalog which gmd used is the redshift survey of about 1,800 galaxies , which is relatively small catalog with respect to the today s standard .",
    "after that survey , numerous redshift surveys such as the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ) , the iras point source catalog redshift survey ( pscz ) , etc .  have been carried out .",
    "recently , the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) was completed . the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )",
    "is now in progress . in the sdss , redshifts of about",
    "@xmath11 galaxies are being observed .",
    "these surveys are large enough to quantitatively discuss the topology of the large - scale structure on large scales .",
    "topological analysis is one of the major methods to analyze these redshift surveys ( see , e.g. , vogeley et al .",
    "1994 ; colley 1997 ; canavezes et al . 1998 ; colley et al .",
    "2000 ) .    the minkowski functionals ( mfs )",
    "are also used as descriptors of the morphology of the large - scale structure . while they are originally mathematical quantities , mecke , buchert , & wagner ( 1994 ) applied the mfs to the analysis of the galaxy clustering .",
    "schmalzing & buchert ( 1997 ) provided a computational algorithm to calculate the mfs .",
    "the genus statistic is one of the mfs in a certain condition .",
    "the mfs possess complementary information to the two - point correlation function or the power spectrum , which are the most fundamental tools to quantify the clustering pattern .",
    "one of the important applications of the genus statistic and the mfs is a gaussianity test of the primordial density field , which can not be performed by the two - point correlation function or the power spectrum .",
    "any gaussian field has a universal form of the genus statistic and the mfs as functions of the density threshold . as a result ,",
    "any deviation from that form indicates the non - gaussianity of a density field .",
    "@xcite analyzed the early sdss sample using the mfs .",
    "they found the mfs of the sdss are consistent with that of the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "however , their analysis is limited by the cosmic variance because of the smallness of the data , and the discrimination of models with various parameters is still difficult .",
    "complete sdss data would distinguish different models in more detail .",
    "when we compare observations with theories , the @xmath0-body simulation plays an important role .",
    "a cosmological @xmath0-body simulation was first carried out by miyoshi & kihara ( 1975 ) . since then , the number of particles in @xmath0-body simulations has been growing every year .",
    "nowadays simulations with the number of particles of over @xmath12 and the physical size of @xmath13 have come to be available .",
    "springel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) compared the genus calculated from an @xmath0-body simulation , which contains @xmath14 particles in a @xmath15 box , with the data of the iras 1.2-jy redshift survey .",
    "@xcite used an @xmath0-body simulation of the @xmath1cdm model carried out by jing & suto ( 1998 ) , which contained @xmath14 particles in a @xmath16 box .",
    "they found that the genus statistic of their @xmath0-body simulations is consistent with the one calculated from the data of the sdss early data release .",
    "recently , @xcite used the hubble volume simulation with a box size of @xmath17 and a number of particles @xmath18 , and investigate the genus statistics with respect to the biasing effects .",
    "a drawback of using the @xmath0-body simulation in comparing theories and observations is that the @xmath0-body simulation is computationally costly to obtain theoretical predictions of given cosmological models .",
    "fortunately , there are analytic approximations for mfs .",
    "the mfs of a random gaussian field is well - known ( tomita 1986 ) .",
    "however , the density field in the universe is not exactly random gaussian even if the primordial density field is gaussian , because of the nonlinear evolution effects .",
    "matsubara ( 2003 ) derived the analytic approximations of the mfs of weakly non - gaussian fields , and obtained analytic formulae of the mfs with effects of the weakly nonlinear evolution by applying the second - order perturbation theory . since in the last formulae",
    "is assumed an approximation that the non - gaussianity is weak , there is a regime that the formulae can be applied .",
    "identifying such regime is indispensable to use the analytic formulae in analyses of the observations , instead of performing computationally costly simulations model by model .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze a large @xmath0-body simulation of the large - scale structure using the mfs and investigate the transition scales between linear and non - linear evolution , and compare them with the theoretical formulae .",
    "the accuracy levels of the above analytic formulae are identified .",
    "we use an @xmath0-body simulation of @xmath19 particles in a box of @xmath20 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we briefly review the concept of mfs and their theoretical formulae . in  3 , we explain the computational methods of the mfs . in  4",
    ", we analyze the mfs of the simulation data and compare them with the analytic formulae . in this section the comparison of the skewness parameters , which play an important role in weakly nonlinear formulae ,",
    "is also presented . in  5 , we summarize the results and discuss future outlook .",
    "mecke , buchert , & wagner ( 1994 ) and schmalzing , & buchert ( 1997 ) proposed the mfs as the geometrical descriptors of the distribution of galaxies .",
    "these quantities are originally derived by minkowski ( 1903 ) . to define the mfs of galaxy distributions , we first consider isodensity contours of the density contrast @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the density field and @xmath23 is the mean density .",
    "then we identify the set of regions @xmath24 where the density contrast @xmath25 exceeds some threshold .",
    "we use the threshold @xmath4 which is defined by @xmath26 for the moment , where @xmath27 is the threshold density contrast and @xmath28 is the _ rms _ of the density contrast .",
    "there are @xmath29 mfs in a @xmath30-dimensional space .",
    "the case @xmath31 is of our primary interest . in this case , the mfs correspond to the following quantities : ( 1 ) the fractional volume enclosed by contours @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the total volume , ( 2 ) the surface area per volume @xmath34 where the region of the integral @xmath35 is the surfaces of the contours , ( 3 ) the integrated mean curvature @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the principal curvatures on the surface , and ( 4 ) the integral gaussian curvature @xmath39 the last quantity is proportional to the euler characteristic of the contour surfaces .",
    "the euler characteristic is also proportional to the genus statistic if the boundary of the sample is neglected .",
    "further geometrical meanings of mfs are found in @xcite .",
    "the analytic formulae of the mfs as functions of the threshold @xmath4 for random gaussian field is given by ( tomita 1986 ; schmalzing & buchert 1997 ) : @xmath40 where @xmath41 , and the factor @xmath42 is the volume of the unit ball in @xmath43-dimensions , i.e. , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",

    "the notation @xmath68 indicates the linear power spectrum .",

    "the values of the skewness parameters are independent on the amplitude of the linear power spectrum in a lowest - order approximation .",
    "the linear power spectrum is given by the adiabatic cdm model with harrison - zeldovich spectrum ( bardeen et al . 1986 ) .",

    "interestingly , the second - order predictions of @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 for @xmath84 are less accurate than the linear predictions . on this scale , both the linear theory and",
    "the second - order theory can be inaccurate .",
    "a possible interpretation is that the strongly nonlinear dynamics affect the mfs to cancel the second - order correction term in the analytic formulae .    as a result , the linear theory and",
    "the second - order theory are difficult to be distinguished when rescaled threshold @xmath9 is used .",
    "this is a good news for testing the primordial non - gaussianity in the density fluctuations since the nonlinear dynamics in course of the density evolution does not significantly alter the shape of mfs in gaussian fields .",

    "the variance @xmath74 calculated from the @xmath0-body simulation is slightly smaller than the linear prediction naturally expected in weakly non - linear regime .    in this paper",
    "we use two definitions of the threshold density , i.e. , @xmath4 defined by the value of the density field , and @xmath9 defined by the volume fraction .",
    "nonlinear effects on mfs are stronger against the threshold @xmath4 than @xmath9 . in most of the previous studies on the topology of the large - scale structure ,",
    "the threshold density @xmath9 has been adopted .",
    "the reason for this choice is that shape of the genus curve is empirically known not to be much affected by the nonlinear evolution .",
    "this was also analytically shown in weakly nonlinear regime . in this paper",
    ", it is shown that the deviations of the mfs on nonlinear scales are indistinguishable with gaussian predictions even though we use a large @xmath0-body sample . to detect the effects of the weakly nonlinear evolution in @xmath9 case",
    ", a larger sample with less cosmic variance will be needed . sampling the galaxies in over @xmath90 comoving volume",

    "for example , in the sdss luminous red galaxy survey @xcite , the large - scale structure up to @xmath91 is being probed .",
    "the covered volume is approximately @xmath90 in this survey .",
    "therefore , our estimates of the errors of mfs in the simulation roughly correspond to the errors in this kind of surveys .",
