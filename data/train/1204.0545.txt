    "just over 10 years ago li and yu discussed , in a very interesting paper@xmath3 , the classification of minimal 2-spheres with constant gaussian curvatures ( called curvature in this paper ) immersed in the complex grassmannian manifold @xmath1 .",
    "the classification of li and yu came in the form of two theorems ( named @xmath4 and @xmath5 in their paper ) .",
    "theorem @xmath4 discussed the holomorphic case and it showed that only four constant curvatures were possible .",
    "these are given as @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , their paper also gave explicit examples of such holomorphic immersions .",
    "theorem @xmath5 described non - holomorphic immersions which correspond to @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    since the appearance of this paper",
    "many other papers have also been written .",
    "in particular , a classification of holomorphic spheres with constant curvature has been produced @xmath10 for @xmath2 .",
    "other contributions by the same authors mostly dealt with non - holomorphic immersions@xmath11 for @xmath12 .    having recently looked@xmath13 at the construction of higher - dimensional surfaces based on harmonic maps of @xmath14 into @xmath15 and other grasmannian manifolds",
    "we have tried to understand the theorems of li and yu using our approach .",
    "the non - holomorphic maps ( theorem b ) were relatively easy to understand by taking , for example , pairs of maps@xmath13 from the veronese sequence .",
    "this , however , was not the case for the holomorphic maps ( theorem a ) .",
    "motivated by this task we have started thinking about the explicit expressions for the curvatures of the holomorphic immersions .",
    "this has lead to the expressions given in the next section and they , in turn , provide us with an explicit algorithmic procedure for the construction of all constant curvature immersions in complex grassmannian manifolds @xmath0 .",
    "when we apply this procedure to @xmath1 we recover the results@xmath3 of li and yu .",
    "we have also retrieved , in a way that will be clarified in the paper , the results of jiao and peng@xmath10 .    in section 2 , we present the general formulae for the curvature of holomorphic immersions into @xmath0 .",
    "two different parametrizations of the solutions are introduced . in section 3",
    ", we discuss such immersions for the case of constant curvature . some of them are related to the veronese curves in @xmath0 and we conjecture that the veronese curves give rise to the smallest possible curvatures . all admissible curvatures for holomorphic solutions are then discussed and we make a second conjecture .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the case of @xmath12 where our conjectures are partially proved and where the cases @xmath1 and @xmath2 are discussed in detail .",
    "let us consider maps of @xmath14 into a grassmaniann manifold @xmath16 .",
    "one way of thinking about such maps involves treating them as fields of @xmath17 @xmath18 models@xmath19 .",
    "thus we consider @xmath20 complex fields put in an array @xmath21 , @xmath22 ( note the order of indices ) .",
    "these fields are subject to the constraint @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the @xmath25 unit matrix .",
    "the fields transform as @xmath26 under global @xmath27 and local @xmath28 transformations .",
    "then one introduces @xmath29 matrix valued gauge fields @xmath30 , which transform as @xmath31 and uses them to construct gauge covariant derivatives @xmath32 here @xmath33 stands for the index of @xmath34 and @xmath35 - two local coordinates on the euclidean space @xmath36 .    then keeping the constraint ( [ const ] ) and defining the gauge fields in terms of @xmath37 and its derivatives @xmath38 we define the lagrangian density (  energy \" - in the harmonic map literature ) as @xmath39 the invariance of the corresponding action @xmath40 leads to the euler - lagrange equations @xmath41 where @xmath42 is an open , connected subset of the euclidean space @xmath36 and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are local coordinates on @xmath42 .",
    "the model described by ( [ lagrangian ] ) and ( [ eulerlagrange ] ) is the so - called two - dimensional @xmath17 grasmannian @xmath18 model .",
    "next we introduce the complex variables and corresponding derivatives in our euclidean space @xmath36 by defining @xmath45    in these coordinates , the lagrangian density is given as @xmath46,\\label{lagrangiancomplex}\\ ] ] and the equations of motion are @xmath47    using the invariance properties of the theory , we can introduce two different parametrizations of the matrix field @xmath37 .",
    "the first one @xmath48 , called the macfarlane parametrization , is given as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a @xmath51 matrix and @xmath52 is a @xmath25 matrix , which due to ( [ const ] ) satisfy @xmath53 since the @xmath25 matrix @xmath54 is clearly hermitian and strictly positive definite , its inverse exists and we define it as @xmath55 such that @xmath56 then@xmath48 , if @xmath50 is holomorphic ,",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath57 the corresponding @xmath37 satisfies the euler - lagrange equations ( [ eulerlagrangecomplex ] ) for the lagrangian ( [ lagrangiancomplex ] ) .",
    "they correspond to the holomorphic immersions of @xmath14 into the grasmannian manifold @xmath0 .",
    "the second parametrization@xmath19 , called orthogonalized parametrization , is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a holomorphic @xmath20 matrix obtained from a set a linearly independent holomorphic vectors @xmath60 and @xmath61 is a @xmath25 matrix . due to ( [ const ] ) we obtain @xmath62 a relation which is similar to ( [ em ] ) .",
    "as holomorphic immersions satisfy @xmath63 ( or @xmath57 ) , for them the lagrangian ( [ lagrangiancomplex ] ) takes the form @xmath64    let us now use the macfarlane parametrisation ( [ part1 ] ) to calculate ( [ lagrangiana ] ) .",
    "first we look at the case of the @xmath15 fields in which @xmath65 is a @xmath66 component vector . in this case , we have @xmath67 however , given that @xmath63 ( and so @xmath68 ) this can be rewritten as @xmath69 and finally @xmath70    we consider now the general grassmannian manifold @xmath0 described by the field ( [ part1 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to check that the two terms in ( [ exp1 ] ) are replaced by ( up to an overall factor @xmath71 ) @xmath72 where @xmath73 is given by ( [ em ] ) .",
    "however , using the property that @xmath74 we rewrite ( [ terms ] ) as @xmath75 as expected , in the @xmath15 case , this reduces to ( [ cpa ] ) .",
    "next we show that ( [ gena ] ) is given by @xmath76 . indeed , since @xmath77",
    ", we obtain @xmath78 but @xmath79 and its easy to check that ( for @xmath80 ) @xmath81 ( as all the minors in @xmath82 involve products of @xmath83 terms ) .    finally , putting everything together we see that for the holomorphic embeddings the lagrangian becomes @xmath84 and the associated curvature is given as @xmath85    here , it is worth noticing that the type of parametrization of @xmath37 , ( _ i.e. _ ( [ part1 ] ) or ( [ moreh ] ) ) , does not affect the proof of this result since the only assumption used in its derivations has been the fact that @xmath65 or @xmath59 is holomorphic . in the case ( [ part1 ] ) ,",
    "the lagrangian is given by ( [ lfinal ] ) with @xmath86 while for the case ( [ moreh ] ) , the lagrangian is given by @xmath87 with @xmath88      let us here explain the choice of the parametrization ( [ moreh ] ) and its name . in @xmath89 , the matrix @xmath90 may be chosen triangular since we start from holomorphic linearly independent vectors @xmath60 that we orthonormalize to obtain @xmath37 .",
    "indeed , the matrix @xmath91 is thus given as @xmath92 where the vectors @xmath93 are obtained from @xmath60 by the well - known gram - schmidt orthogonalization process .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath94    in particular , for @xmath12 , we see that we have @xmath95 which can be diagonalized as @xmath96 with @xmath97 we thus obtain @xmath98    note that we can also define a ` wedge product ' of two vectors ; namely , @xmath99 .",
    "such a quantity gives us an @xmath100 matrix defined as @xmath101 then it is easy to check that @xmath102 this suggests another way of thinking of @xmath103 which can be generalized to @xmath0 .    indeed",
    ", we can write @xmath104 with @xmath105 and where @xmath106      since the grassmannian manifold @xmath0 is defined as the coset space @xmath107 , we have the well - known duality property @xmath108 .",
    "we can thus use the macfarlane parametrization to prove the following theorem :    * theorem 1 : * the holomorphic solutions of @xmath0 are in one - to - one correspondence with the holomorphic solutions of @xmath109 .",
    "furthermore , we have @xmath110 _ proof : _ let @xmath111 be defined by @xmath112 we see that , since the transposition map is one - to - one , the map @xmath113 is one - to - one and @xmath113 establishes a one - to - one correspondence between the macfarlane parametrization of @xmath0 and the macfarlane parametrization of @xmath114 . to prove the second part of the theorem",
    "we calculate @xmath115 .",
    "we find @xmath116 the last equality is a direct consequence of the sylvester s determinant theorem .",
    "this concludes the proof .    from theorem 1",
    ", we note that if @xmath117 is the curvature ( not necessarily constant ) of a holomorphic solution of @xmath0 then @xmath117 is the curvature of the corresponding holomorphic solution of @xmath109 and vice - versa .",
    "in particular , holomorphic solutions of @xmath118 are obtained from holomorphic solutions of @xmath119",
    ".    moreover , the special case @xmath120 enjoys an additional transposition invariance for all @xmath121 .",
    "this invariance will be used , in particular , to give a complete classification of holomorphic immersions of constant curvature of @xmath14 into @xmath1 .",
    "let us recall that if we want holomorphic immersions in @xmath0 with constant curvature @xmath117 , the lagrangian must take the form @xmath122 where @xmath123 .",
    "this implies that in ( [ em ] ) and ( [ em1 ] ) , the expression of @xmath124 and @xmath103 must be proportional to @xmath125 where the positive integer @xmath126 is related to the curvature @xmath127 for @xmath128 , we know that special solutions corresponding to the so - called veronese curve @xmath129 are given by @xmath130 and have constant curvature @xmath131 .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath132 . we know that",
    ", up to gauge invariance , veronese curves @xmath133 , are the only solutions imbedded in @xmath15 giving rise to holomorphic solutions@xmath134 .",
    "we can generalize this result to the veronese holomorphic curve in @xmath0 which takes the form @xmath135 for which the curvature is now@xmath13 @xmath136    we will conjecture in the following that this curve is the minimal constant curvature that we can find for holomorphic solutions.the corresponding integer @xmath126 in @xmath103 , denoted @xmath137 , is given by @xmath138    let us mention that this general result about the curvature of the veronese curves may be easily recovered using our recent study@xmath13 of projectors associated with the veronese sequence . starting from the vector @xmath139 given by ( [ tildezvero ] ) , we construct a solution of the @xmath0 model by the gram - schmidt orthogonalization process as usual and obtain @xmath140 where the operator @xmath141 is defined as @xmath142 a sequence of projectors @xmath143 could thus be constructed from these functions , _ ie _ , @xmath144    we have shown in @xmath13 that the curvature @xmath145 is related to the following quantity @xmath146 which is exactly the expected value ( [ rmn ] ) of the power @xmath126 . in the macfarlane parametrization ( [ part1 ] ) , we get for the holomorphic veronese curve in @xmath0 , the following expression , @xmath147 for @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "* theorem 2 : * holomorphic solutions with constant curvature of @xmath150 generate holomorphic solutions with the same curvature of @xmath0 by embedding .",
    "_ proof : _ using the wedge product introduced in section 2 we get @xmath151 setting @xmath152 for @xmath153 in the expression of @xmath154 given in ( [ agen ] ) , we obtain @xmath155 this concludes the proof .      in the previous subsection , we have just seen that @xmath0 admits a special type of holomorphic solutions with constant curvature such that @xmath156 . moreover , in different approaches@xmath157 , a systematic classification of holomorphic solutions with constant curvatures has been given for @xmath1 and @xmath2 and it was shown that there exist such solutions for all integer values @xmath158 .",
    "based on these results and on our detailed investigations , we present here two our conjectures about holomorphic solutions of @xmath0 with constant curvature .",
    "* conjecture 1 * : the maximal value of @xmath126 in the expression of @xmath103 ( @xmath124 ) for which there exists a holomorphic solution of @xmath0 of constant curvature is given by @xmath159 .",
    "this solution corresponds to the veronese holomorphic curve ( [ tildezvero ] ) and its curvature is minimal ( [ mincurv ] ) .",
    "this conjecture is clearly true for @xmath128 . due to the duality property",
    ", it is also true for @xmath118 .    in the general case , since the expression of @xmath103 for @xmath0 contains at most @xmath160 terms , the maximal power @xmath126 is @xmath161 .",
    "since @xmath162 , in order to prove conjecture 1 , we thus have to show that the values @xmath163 are not possible .",
    "for example , for @xmath12 , we obtain @xmath164 .",
    "this shows that the number of values of @xmath165 that have to be checked ( and proved not to correspond to constant curvature solutions ) in order to prove our conjecture is thus given by @xmath166 in the next section , we prove our conjecture for @xmath167 .    * conjecture 2 * : for @xmath168 fixed , holomorphic solutions with constant curvature in @xmath0 can be constructed for all integer values of @xmath126 such that @xmath169 .",
    "more precisely , the conjecture can be stated as follows : for @xmath168 fixed , all integers @xmath170 , give rise to holomorphic solutions of constant curvature in @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , from theorem 2 , we know that @xmath0 has holomorphic solutions for @xmath171 by simple embedding from the holomorphic solutions of @xmath150 .",
    "the solution corresponding to @xmath172 is given by the veronese sequence ( [ tildezvero ] ) .",
    "the conjecture is true also for @xmath128 and due to the duality property , it is also true for @xmath118 .    in the next section ,",
    "we discuss both conjectures for the case @xmath12 , for which some partial results are already known@xmath157 .",
    "we consider @xmath173 in the following developments . indeed , for @xmath174 , the conjectures are true due to the duality with @xmath175 .",
    "as mentioned before , constant curvature holomorphic solutions for the @xmath12 case are obtained for @xmath176 by simple embeddings from the holomorphic solutions of @xmath177 . for @xmath178",
    ", we obtain the veronese holomorphic solution from ( [ tildezvero ] ) .",
    "it means that our conjectures will be proven if we show that the values of @xmath126 given by @xmath179 are not admissible ( conjecture 1 ) and that we can exhibit a solution for @xmath180 ( conjecture 2 ) .",
    "let us start with some general results on the explicit form of holomorphic solutions with constant curvature in @xmath12 .",
    "we consider the orthogonalized parametrization ( [ part1 ] ) which can be written @xmath181 and such that @xmath182    gauge invariance ( [ trans ] ) can now be used to obtain a canonical choice of @xmath183 and obtain a classification of solutions .",
    "in fact , previous approaches@xmath157 for the cases of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 models have explicitly used this gauge invariance . due to the parametrization ( [ hatz2 ] )",
    ", we can make the following transformations of the matrix @xmath183 @xmath184 with constant matrices @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "as in recent papers@xmath157 , the elements of the matrix @xmath183 , can be chosen to be @xmath187 due to the invariance property ( [ kprime ] ) , we may choose @xmath188 .",
    "without loss of generality , we can also take @xmath189 et @xmath190 .",
    "moreover , in order to obtain @xmath191 as a function of @xmath192 only we have to satisfy the constraints @xmath193    we are now interested in the explicit expression for the determinant ( [ detmgen ] ) .",
    "this can be done using the wedge product introduced in section 2 ( see ( [ wedge1 ] ) ) for the orthogonalized parametrization with @xmath194 .",
    "we thus define @xmath195 the coordinates @xmath196 are , fact , the so called plcker coordinates@xmath197 .",
    "they satisfy @xmath198 and the plcker relations @xmath199 for @xmath200 . from the explicit form of the elements of @xmath183 given in ( [ k2gen ] ) we find that @xmath201 and @xmath202 with @xmath203 .",
    "the next step involves the verification that we can construct an embedding@xmath197 of @xmath12 into @xmath204 .",
    "indeed , we introduce the map @xmath205 , where @xmath206 is the number of plcker coordinates , such that @xmath207 with @xmath208 being a @xmath209 component vector .",
    "then it is easy to prove that @xmath210 for example , for @xmath1 , we have an embedding into @xmath211 and the map @xmath212 is explicitly given by @xmath213    let us now present some general results for the @xmath12 case dealing with extremal values of @xmath126 related to the quantity @xmath214 .",
    "* theorem 3 : * in the grassmannian manifold @xmath12 for @xmath215 , the value @xmath216 does not give rise to a holomorphic solution with constant curvature .",
    "+ _ proof : _ in order to obtain the maximal power @xmath216 in the expression of @xmath217 , all the plcker coordinates @xmath218 must be different from zero and the corresponding powers must be all different .",
    "the ordering of these powers implies that the two highest ones appear in @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
    "they are given by @xmath221 we thus obtain @xmath222 and , consequently , @xmath223 this shows , however , that these two powers are the same which contradicts the assumption .",
    "this concludes the proof .",
    "let us mention that theorem 3 is also valid for @xmath224 but the proof is different and will be given in the next subsections .      in this case , we have @xmath225 conjecture 1 will be proven if we show that the power @xmath226 is not allowed in the expression of @xmath227 given by ( [ detmplucker ] ) .",
    "it is easy to prove , since we have @xmath228 and , using the transposition invariance , @xmath229 , we obtain the following constraints : @xmath230 which , together with @xmath231 can not be satisfied . for @xmath232",

    "is @xmath242 where the ten component vector @xmath243 is given by @xmath244    let us recall that conjecture 2 will be proven in this case if we obtain a solution of this type for @xmath226 .",

    "explicit but somewhat involved calculations show that both cases are incompatible ( details in appendix 1 ) .",
    "thus we have found that @xmath293 does not lead to holomorphic solutions with constant curvatures .",
    "this completes the proof .    as a final comment in this subsection",
    "let us mention that we know from theorem 1 that the complete classification of such solutions for @xmath2 gives rise to a complete classification of holomorphic solutions with constant curvatures for @xmath296 .",
    "in this paper , we have found an explicit formula for the curvature of holomorphic immersions of @xmath14 into the general grassmannian manifold @xmath0 .",
    "this formula has given us a way to look at general results concerning the classification of holomorphic maps of constant curvature .",
    "in particular , it allowed us to formulate two conjectures on the possible values of curvatures of such embeddings . to test the validity of our conjectures we looked in detail on the case of @xmath12 using plcker coordinates and at an embedding into the well - known @xmath297 model .",
    "both conjectures have been proven for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 models . in both cases",
    ", we obtained the full classifications of solutions and we did calculate the values of the corresponding constant curvatures . in the @xmath1 case",
    "our results agree with the classification@xmath3 given by li and yu and in the @xmath2 case we have reproduced the classification presented in @xmath10 .",
    "so far we have not succeeded in proving our conjectures even for the @xmath12 case . indeed , in order to prove conjecture 2 , it remains to demonstrate the case of @xmath180 , which is not easy for @xmath298 . however we believe it to be correct and appendix 2 we produce a numerical proof of the existence of holomorphic solutions with @xmath293 in the @xmath299 case .    in order to prove conjecture 1",
    ", we have to make a deep analysis of the nonlinear constraints on the plcker coordinates .",
    "to complete the proof of proposition 1 , we need to show that , in the case of @xmath258 and @xmath259 , the value @xmath293 is not admissible .",
    "we have two possible candidates corresponding to @xmath300 and @xmath301 . in both cases",
    ", we have to impose @xmath302 .    for @xmath300 , we have to satisfy the additional constraints @xmath303 where @xmath304 ( using gauge invariance ) .",
    "we , then , deduce that @xmath305 from which we calculate @xmath306 and end up with the following equation to satisfy @xmath307 we , then , maximize the left hand side by imposing @xmath308 ( note that @xmath304 ) which becomes a function of one variable @xmath309 .",
    "this can , in turn , be maximized but lead to the following impossible constraint @xmath310    for the @xmath301 case , we get the following constraints on the coefficients @xmath311 where , by gauge invariance , @xmath304 .",
    "we , thus , deduce that @xmath312 furthermore , we may calculate @xmath313 which has to satisfy @xmath314 and thus we are left with the equation @xmath315 to satisfy .",

    "the remaining coordinates then become @xmath327 which most satisfy the constraints @xmath328    this set of quadratic constraints on the plcker coordinates justified the use of a mathematical program ( we used _",
    "mathematica _ 8 . )",
    "a symbolic solution of these constraints was found by the program .",
