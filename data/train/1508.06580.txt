    "the late time acceleration of the universe is one of the great problems of modern physics .",
    "ever since this acceleration was suggested by type - ia supernovae surveys @xcite , this important result has been backed up by ever increasingly precise cosmological observations , including measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , the hubble constant @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite , and further measurements of type - ia supernovae @xcite . despite all these observations , there is a severe lack of understanding of this acceleration from a theoretical point of view .",
    "the standard cosmological model assumes the existence of a cosmological constant to explain this acceleration .",
    "however , a cosmological constant suffers from theoretical difficulties dues to its extremely small observed value compared to predictions from quantum field theoretical considerations , see  @xcite for a review of this subject .",
    "teleparallel gravity is an alternative formulation of gravity which is equivalent to general relativity .",
    "general relativity is a geometric theory based on the levi - civita connection , which possesses curvature but zero torsion . on the other hand teleparallel gravity",
    "uses a different connection .",
    "there is a result originally discovered by weitzenbck that it is always possible to define a connection on a space such that is globally flat , in other words it possesses zero curvature .",
    "this connection is called the weitzenbck connection , and although it has a vanishing ricci tensor it has non trivial torsion .",
    "this result is used to formulate an action based on a gravitational scalar called the torsion scalar @xmath0 , which uses the weitzenbck connection .",
    "the dynamics of this action are completely equivalent to general relativity , and this follows from the following result @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the ricci scalar , and @xmath5 is a boundary term related to the divergence of the torsion .",
    "since @xmath5 is a total derivative , it gives no contribution to the field equations , and hence the action of teleparallel gravity is completely equivalent to the einstein hilbert action .",
    "there are numerous ways to modify both general relativity and teleparallel gravity with the aim of being able to understand the late time acceleration of the universe without the need for a cosmological constant .",
    "one approach is to modify the gravitational sector and one can consider both @xmath6 theories of gravity and @xmath7 theories . in general",
    "these give rise to different dynamics , since one can no longer write @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath6 gravity generically has fourth order field equations . in some sense @xmath7 theories are less harmful in that this modification only results in second order field equations , however the price you pay for this is that local lorentz invariance is lost . in a recent paper",
    "@xcite a more general theory was considered in the teleparallel framework called @xmath9 gravity , where @xmath5 is a divergence of the torsion , which incorporates both @xmath6 and @xmath7 gravity as particular subcases .",
    "another approach is to modify the contents of the universe and add a form of matter into the universe called dark energy which possesses a negative pressure .",
    "this can be achieved by adding to the matter sector a canonical scalar field  @xcite , known as quintessence , a phantom scalar field  @xcite , or a combination of both of these fields called quintom  @xcite .",
    "a review of these models can be found in  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one can also consider a coupling between the scalar field and the gravitational sector .",
    "the standard approach is to consider a coupling between the scalar field and the ricci scalar , of the form @xmath10",
    "such a nonminimal coupling has motivations from different contexts .",
    "it appears as a result of quantum corrections to the scalar field in curved spacetimes  @xcite and it is also required by renormalisation considerations  @xcite .",
    "it also appears in the context of superstring theories  @xcite .",
    "such models have attempted to explain the early time inflationary epoch , however the simple model with a quadratic scalar potential is now disfavoured by the current planck data  @xcite .    in recent years an alternative formulation has been considered where the coupling occurs between the scalar field and torsion of the form @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to different dynamics and interesting phenomenology , for example phantom behaviour and dynamical crossing of the phantom barrier .",
    "a dynamical systems analysis of these models were considered in  @xcite , and the observational constraints on such models were found in  @xcite .",
    "other types of nonminimal coupling to the torsion sector have been considered , for example in  @xcite a coupling between torsion and derivatives of the scalar field are considered .    in this paper",
    "we consider a different approach where we examine a nonminimal coupling between the scalar field to both the torsion scalar @xmath0 and the boundary term @xmath5 .",
    "we note that coupling a scalar field to a boundary term is not a new idea , for example a nonminimal coupling between a scalar field boundary terms such as the gauss - bonnet term and higher lovelock polynomials have previously been considered  @xcite .",
    "our theory encompasses both nonminimally coupled teleparallel gravity and nonminimally coupled general relativity in suitable limits .",
    "we then consider in detail the dynamics of the model when we have only a coupling between the boundary term @xmath5 and the scalar field .",
    "we use dynamical systems techniques to examine the global dynamics of the system .",
    "these techniques are widely used in cosmological applications since they allow one to study all possible evolutional paths when there is no possibility of finding an exact solution .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ tele ]",
    "we introduce our conventions and the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity . in section  [ nmcsf ]",
    "we briefly review previous models involving nonminimally coupled scalar fields , and introduce the lagrangian and field equations of our model . in section  [ cosmology ]",
    "we derive the equations determining the background cosmology . finally in section  [ dsboundary ] we perform a dynamical systems analysis in the case where we have purely a coupling between the scalar field and the boundary term .",
    "in this section we introduce the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity .",
    "the dynamical variable in this theory are given by the tetrad @xmath12 , where greek indices are spacetime indices , and latin indices are tangent space indices .",
    "the metric @xmath13 is given in terms of the tetrad as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the minkowski metric .",
    "we also introduce the inverse tetrad @xmath16 , such that @xmath17 the quantity @xmath18 is defined to be the determinant of the tetrad @xmath19 , and is equivalent to the volume element of the metric , @xmath20 .    in what follows we will obey the conventions outlined in  @xcite . in general relativity",
    "the levi - civita connection is used , however in contrast , in teleparallel gravity the weitzenbck connection @xmath21 is chosen , and is given by the following derivatives of the tetrad @xmath22 this connection possesses torsion but the ricci tensor of this connection vanishes , and hence possesses zero curvature .",
    "the torsion tensor is simply the antisymmetric part of the weitzenbck connection @xmath23 the tensor @xmath24 , which we call the torsion vector , is defined as the unique nontrivial contraction of the torsion tensor @xmath25    now the field equations of teleparallel gravity follow from varying the following lagrangian density with respect to the tetrad @xmath26 where the tensor @xmath27 is defined as the following @xmath28 this combination of @xmath29 and @xmath30 is usually denoted by @xmath0 , which we call the torsion scalar @xmath31    now in order to show that teleparallel gravity is equivalent to general relativity , we must express quantities using the weitzenbck connection in terms of quantities involving the torsion free levi - civita connection .",
    "one can write the levi - civita connection @xmath32 in terms of the weitzenbck connection as so @xmath33 where here @xmath34 is called the contortion tensor and it is defined as @xmath35 this contortion tensor is antisymmetric in its last two indices . now expressing the ricci scalar of the levi - civita connection in terms of the weitzenbck connection using  ( [ levi ] ) , the following relation can be found @xmath36 as the difference between the ricci scalar and the torsion scalar is simply a total derivative , the action  ( [ taction ] ) gives rise to the same dynamics as the einstein hilbert action .",
    "this shows that teleparallel gravity is indeed equivalent to general relativity . defining the boundary quantity",
    "@xmath37 one then has simply the relation @xmath2 . in  @xcite",
    "this led us to consider the modification @xmath9 gravity . in this work",
    "we will follow a different approach to include the term @xmath5 nontrivially in the dynamics , by coupling it to a scalar field .",
    "we also note that one can write @xmath5 in terms of a levi - civita covariant derivative simply as @xmath38 .",
    "the first approach to nonminimally coupling a scalar field to the gravitational sector is to consider a coupling to the ricci tensor as follows @xmath39 \\sqrt{-g}\\ , d^4x \\ , .\\label{actionricci}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this approach was originally considered in the context of brans - dicke theories motivated by introducing a variable gravitational constant depending on a scalar field . in this notation",
    "the effective gravitational constant can be written as @xmath40 and one can redefine such a scalar field so that it coincides with the standard brans - dicke field .",
    "non - minimally coupled quintessence corresponds to taking @xmath41 in the above lagrangian . for a review of quintessence type models , see  @xcite .",
    "quintessence alone can give rise to many interesting features from late time accelerated expansion of the universe to inflation  @xcite .",
    "however simple models of scalar field inflation are becoming disfavoured by the latest planck data .",
    "another issue with a simple quintessence approach is that the effective equation of state must always satisfy @xmath42 and require a very flat fine tuned potential in order to explain current cosmological observations .",
    "when @xmath43 , the nonminimal coupling can be transformed to a minimal coupling via a conformal transformation from the jordan frame to the einstein frame .",
    "such a transformation reduces the system to a quintessence model with a coupling between the scalar field and dark matter . for a constant exponential potential",
    ", the system can then be written as a two dimensional dynamical system .",
    "physical quantities in this frame can then be transformed back into physical quantities in the jordan frame . for a review of the dynamics of these models ,",
    "see chapter 9 of  @xcite and references therein .",
    "alternatively , one can work directly in the jordan frame ; a dynamical systems analysis for various potentials have been considered by various authors , see  @xcite and references within .",
    "an alternative approach has been to consider a scalar field nonminimally coupled to torsion , giving rise to teleparallel dark energy theories  @xcite .",
    "the following action is considered @xmath44 e\\ , d^4x \\,.\\label{actiontorsio}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this gives rise to different dynamics to the case of the nonminimal coupling to the ricci scalar .",
    "of course with a minimal coupling , setting @xmath41 , the two theories again become equivalent due to the teleparallel equivalence .",
    "this theory again has a richer structure than simple standard quintessence behaviour , with both phantom and quintessence type dynamics possible , along with dynamical crossing of the phantom barrier .",
    "the equivalence between general relativity and teleparallel gravity breaks down as soon as one nonminimally couples a scalar field , the field equations result in different dynamics . in this paper",
    ", we consider a more general action  @xcite , with the aim of unifying both of the previous considered approaches @xmath45 e\\ , d^4x.\\label{action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when one sets @xmath46 one will recover an action which is equivalent to  ( [ actionricci ] ) , and when one sets @xmath47 the action  ( [ actiontorsio ] ) is recovered .",
    "a particularly interesting subcase will be when @xmath41 , corresponding to a pure coupling between the boundary term .",
    "such a coupling has not been previously studied in the literature .",
    "one could in principle choose a more general coupling @xmath48 between the potential and the boundary , however the choice @xmath49 ensures that the constant @xmath50 is dimensionless .",
    "we now derive the field equations of the action  ( [ action ] ) . varying the action with respect to the tetrad field yields the following field equations @xmath51-e^{\\nu}_a \\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_\\mu \\phi \\partial^\\mu \\phi -v(\\phi)\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ + e^{\\mu}_a \\partial^\\nu \\phi",

    "@xmath54 is the standard energy momentum tensor derived from varying the matter sector , and is not to be confused with torsion .    the term in the field equations proportional to @xmath55 is lorentz violating  @xcite .",
    "this term vanishes only in the case when we have @xmath56 , which corresponds to the case where the nonminimal coupling reduces to that of a coupling to only the ricci scalar .",
    "this result is along similar lines to that obtained in  @xcite , where the modification @xmath9 was considered , where it was found that the field equations are invariant under local lorentz transformations if and only if @xmath57 .",
    "now it can be shown that the einstein tensor of the levi - civita connection can be related to the torsion sector via the relation @xmath58e^a_\\sigma.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this means we can write the field equations in a covariant form as follows @xmath59 + \\nabla_\\mu \\phi \\nabla_\\nu \\phi & \\nonumber\\\\   - 4(\\xi+\\chi ) s_{\\mu}{}^{\\lambda}\\,_{\\nu}\\phi \\partial_\\lambda \\phi-\\chi\\big[g_{\\mu\\nu}\\box(\\phi^2)- \\nabla_{\\mu}\\nabla_{\\nu}(\\phi^2)\\big]&= t_{\\mu\\nu}. \\label{fieldeqncov}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is readily seen that this equation reduces to the correct field equation for a nonminimal coupling of a scalar field to the ricci scalar when one takes @xmath46 .",
    "finally we have the modified scalar field equation .",
    "this is obtained by varying the action with respect to the scalar field , yielding the following klein - gordon equation @xmath60",
    "in this section we will derive the background equations for the cosmology of the above models .",
    "we will consider the standard spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) tetrad @xmath61 corresponding to a spatially flat frw metric @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the scale factor .",
    "we will assume the energy momentum tensor of the matter sector is standard barotropic matter given by an isotropic perfect fluid @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the matter energy density and @xmath66 is the pressure .",
    "we will also assume all dynamical quantities , including the scalar field @xmath67 , are homogeneous , depending only the time @xmath68 .",
    "inserting this frw tetrad into the field equations  ( [ fieldeqn ] ) gives us the following friedmann equations @xmath69 here @xmath70 is the hubble parameter @xmath71 and we have defined the energy density and pressure of the scalar field as follows @xmath72 and the klein - gordon equation  ( [ kg ] ) reduces to @xmath73 in the above derivations we have used that the torsion scalar and boundary term can be written as @xmath74    we see that the coupling to the torsion scalar introduces a term proportional to @xmath75 in the first friedmann equation  ( [ fe1 ] ) , whereas the boundary term involves the addition of a @xmath76 term .",
    "one can define the equation of state of the dark energy or scalar field as the following ratio of the scalar field pressure and energy density @xmath77 and also we define the total or effective equation of state as @xmath78 analogously to the standard matter energy density @xmath79 we will define the density parameter of the dark energy or scalar field as @xmath80 so that the relation @xmath81 holds",
    ".    in this model matter obeys the standard conservation equations @xmath82 and hence also @xmath83",
    "in this section we analyse in detail using dynamical systems techniques the case where @xmath41 , where we purely have a coupling of the scalar field to the boundary term . in this case",
    "the quantity @xmath84 is always positive , and so there is an energy flow from dark matter to dark energy .",
    "let us introduce the dimensionless variables @xmath85 which straightforwardly generalise the normalised variables used to analyse standard quintessence  @xcite .",
    "the first friedman equation  ( [ fe1 ] ) written in these variables is simply the constraint @xmath86 which will define the boundary of our phase space",
    ".    the phase space will be three dimensional , and we choose to work with the variables @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",
    "since the energy density of matter is non - negative , the relation @xmath90 must be satisfied .",
    "as in standard quintessence , due to symmetries of the system , we can assume without loss of generality that our potential is positive and so we only need to consider @xmath91 .",
    "there is no restriction on the sign of @xmath87 or @xmath89 , since @xmath92 can be positive or negative , as can @xmath50 .",
    "this means that generically our phase space is non - compact , except in the case of a minimal coupling with @xmath47 .",
    "if we further introduce the variables @xmath93 and @xmath94 then the phase space becomes @xmath95 which we see is simply hyperbolic space @xmath96 .",
