    "large - scale magnetic fields are known to be present in a wide variety of stellar objects , meaning that in these stars the dipole component ( together perhaps with some other low - order multipoles ) is not much weaker than the rms surface field .",
    "the initial discovery of such fields was in ap stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "since then , they have been observed or inferred to exist in white dwarfs , neutron stars , upper - main - sequence stars , and in the central stars of planetary nebulae .",
    "these fields appear to be long - lived , since they do not evolve on a timescale accessible to observations ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "a common feature of all these objects is that , over most of their interior , they are stably stratified .",
    "white dwarfs and neutron stars have no significant convective regions , while upper - main - sequence stars only have a small convective core .",
    "dynamo effects are therefore expected to be irrelevant in keeping the strength of the magnetic field constant . the maximum surface magnetic fluxes observed in all these objects are similar , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the highest surface dipole strength detected in each class of objects .",
    "these two features are considered compelling arguments in favour of flux freezing during stellar evolution , although magnetic flux is certain to be lost in supernova explosions , so it is plausible that the magnetic field is regenerated somehow in a young neutron star ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ratio of fluid to magnetic pressure is ( @xcite ) @xmath3 which is a very large number even for the most strongly magnetised stars , unless the internal magnetic fields are substantially larger than the surface magnetic fields .",
    "since this ratio is so high , we do not expect these fields to significantly modify the hydrostatic structure of the stars ( i.e. their internal density and temperature profiles ) .",
    "however , they can play a major role in their evolution , e.g. , through the transport of angular momentum ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "even though these long - lived fields have been known to exist for more than half a century , it has not been possible to find an analytic model for a field that is in a stable equilibrium .",
    "however , stable configurations that do not seem to evolve on timescales comparable to the alfvn crossing time have been found to exist via numerical calculations ( @xcite ) , where an initially random field usually evolves into an approximately axisymmetric configuration that is a combination of toroidal and poloidal components of similar energies ( for axisymmetric fields , toroidal and poloidal refer to the azimuthal and meridional components of the field , respectively ) .",
    "the stability of purely poloidal or purely toroidal fields has also been studied in the past .",
    "@xcite , using the energy method , suggested that every purely toroidal field is unstable on an alfvn timescale , independent of the strength of the field . @xcite and independently @xcite discovered that purely poloidal fields with closed lines contained inside the star are affected by an instability that is very similar to the kink instabilities in a z - pinch .    a simple argument given by @xcite shows that any purely poloidal field with field lines extending outside the star should be unstable . if the initial configuration is such that the external field resembles a dipole , cutting the star in half and rotating each half by @xmath0 in opposite directions ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fandrfig ] ) would greatly reduce the dipole component of the field , leading to a magnetic field with less energy .",
    "however , neither flowers and ruderman nor anyone else have given a formal proof of this argument .",
    "in the numerical simulations of @xcite , instabilities related to the poloidal and toroidal components of the field are studied . using the stable configurations found after simulating the evolution of random fields , braithwaite used different ratios of poloidal to total energy of the magnetic field , @xmath4 , and found the field to be stable for @xmath5 .",
    "the field became unstable for @xmath6 , with an @xmath7 mode that seems to consist mostly of displacements in latitude of the fluid .",
    "for @xmath8 , modes with higher @xmath9 became unstable , as would be expected since these modes have to overcome a higher resistance from the toroidal field .",
    "these modes resemble kink instabilities , as was mentioned before .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following : in  [ far::proofex ] , we formally prove the flowers - ruderman instability for a pure dipole field .",
    "to do so , we explicitly calculate the energy of the external magnetic field as a function of the angle of rotation of each half of the star , and see that it is a monotonically decreasing function . in  [ far::pertu ]",
    "we treat the problem using perturbation theory for a particular family of fields . in  [ csfar ] , we estimate the stabilising effect of a toroidal field when the perturbation is not done with a sharp cut through the star , but rather with a displacement field that switches continuously from one direction of rotation to the other , over a thin but finite region . in  [ far::succesive ] , we show that , contrary to what has been claimed previously in the literature , higher order multipoles can not be achieved with successive cuts in different directions , and in  [ conclusions ] , we present the conclusions of our work .",
    "we consider the star to be non - rotating and completely surrounded by vacuum . inside the star ,",
    "the magnetic field is axisymmetric and purely poloidal , and outside the star the field is a pure dipole .",
    "if we completely ignore the effects of the magnetic field on the hydrostatic structure of the star ( an assumption we justify in  [ far::sphere ] ) , then the star should be perfectly spherical , and when the flowers - ruderman instability takes place , each half of the star rotates as a rigid solid . since in stellar interiors",
    "the magnetic reynolds number is much larger than @xmath10 , field lines will be dragged by the fluid without modifying the magnitude of the magnetic field at each point , and thus the internal magnetic energy of the star will not be modified in the process .",
    "therefore , we are only interested in the energy of the external magnetic field , and we now proceed to prove that this energy is in fact monotonically reduced by performing the displacement suggested by flowers and ruderman .      to start , we must obtain the magnetic field outside the star , given the field on its surface . because outside the star there are no currents , we have @xmath11 and therefore @xmath12 . since @xmath13 ,",
    "@xmath14 must satisfy laplace s equation , @xmath15 the solution to this equation in spherical coordinates that is of physical significance to us is @xmath16 where the term with @xmath17 is excluded since it corresponds to a magnetic monopole .",
    "the @xmath18 are obtained by requiring the field to have a continuous normal component at the surface , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the radial component of the field .",
    "now , the magnetic energy inside the star should not change , since the field only rotates while keeping its magnitude .",
    "however , the exterior field changes significantly .",
    "thus , the variation of the magnetic energy can be obtained just by computing the variation outside of the star .",
    "the exterior magnetic energy is obtained from @xmath21 where @xmath22 covers all space outside the star , and we used the fact that @xmath14 satisfies laplace s equation . using the divergence theorem , the energy can be expressed as a surface integral , with a normal pointing into the star : that decreases most slowly with @xmath23 goes like @xmath24 , so @xmath25 goes like @xmath26 and vanishes in the limit @xmath27 . ]",
    "@xmath28 since we consider the star to be perfectly spherical,@xmath29 , and consequently @xmath30 where in the last step , we used the fact that @xmath14 is real and set it equal to its conjugate . replacing the expression for @xmath14 , as given by eq .",
    "( [ psi ] ) , we get the following result : @xmath31 where we used eq .",
    "( [ alm ] ) to express the integral in terms of the @xmath18 .",
    "if we define @xmath32 as @xmath33 the energy of the external magnetic field is @xmath34 another useful result is the radial component of the field at the surface expressed in terms of the @xmath32 coefficients .",
    "this can be obtained from the radial component of @xmath35 , or by inverting eq .",
    "( [ clmdef ] ) , and it is equal to @xmath36      the results contained in eq .",
    "( [ efe ] ) can be used to prove that the energy is effectively reduced when one half of the star is rotated with respect to the other . to do so , let us define a quantity @xmath37 as @xmath38 this quantity will be conserved when the star is cut in half and rotated .",
    "so , using the superscripts @xmath39 and @xmath40 to denote initial and final states , @xmath41 .",
    "if we use the result of eq .",
    "( [ radialb ] ) to express the terms of @xmath42 , we get @xmath43 by rewriting @xmath41 , we obtain @xmath44 if the initial external field is a dipole field , the only nonzero @xmath45 is @xmath46 . considering this , @xmath47 from here , using eq .",
    "( [ efe ] ) we get that @xmath48 thus , the final state will have less or equal energy than the initial one .",
    "the equality would hold if and only if the @xmath49 are equal to zero when @xmath50 , which is not the case since the severe discontinuity that is produced can not be resolved into an expansion of spherical harmonics with a finite number of terms .",
    "it is important to note , however , that we only proved that the magnetic energy of any final state after cutting the star and rotating it is less than the initial energy of the dipole field .",
    "we have yet to prove that the energy is monotonically decreasing for the entire rotation .",
    "so , up to this point , we could expect the minimum energy to be present at some intermediate point in the rotation , and not after the rotation has been completed .",
    "the initial field outside of the star is that of a dipole , so @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the strength of the field at the poles .",

    "however , from the results of  [ far::less ] , we already know that the final energy is smaller than the initial one , thus @xmath73 and the energy decreases monotonically along the entire rotation . therefore , the flowers - ruderman instability is present in the case of the purely dipolar field .    even though we already proved the existence of the instability , an estimate of @xmath74 is called for . to obtain this estimate",
    ", we consider the quantity @xmath75 which tends asymptotically to @xmath74 as @xmath76 increases .",
    "also , due to the conservation of @xmath37 described in  [ far::less ] , and the initial and final values of the @xmath32 , which can be obtained by setting @xmath56 equal to zero or @xmath0 respectively in eq .",
    "( [ ceees ] ) , it can be seen that the @xmath77 must satisfy @xmath78 using this , we can obtain lower and upper bounds on the value of @xmath74 , @xmath79 and since both limits tend asymptotically to @xmath74 as @xmath76 increases , this in principle can be used to evaluate @xmath74 to an arbitrary precision . by using @xmath80 , one finds that @xmath81 the final energy of the system is @xmath82 , so the process nearly halves the energy of the external magnetic field .",
    "@xcite gave a value of @xmath83 , which is slightly higher than ours , but he did not describe exactly how he computed that number .      extending the previous analysis to consider the superposition of multipole components with the dipole component turns out to be a much more complicated problem .",
    "however , it is possible to get a simple answer if we only consider axisymmetric fields , and if we only care about the energy difference between the final and the initial state .",
    "consider an axisymmetric field that consists of a dipole and some higher order multipole , of fixed order @xmath84 , @xmath85 where the superscript @xmath39 is used to denote that these coefficients represent the initial state .",
    "after the rotation , the field might not be axisymmetric , and it will be defined by some set of coefficients @xmath49 . from eq .",
    "( [ efe ] ) , the final energy of the system is @xmath86    it can be shown that the final configuration has no dipole component , by proving that each multipole by itself does not produce a dipole component after the rotation . to do this",
    ", we consider one half of the star to be rotated by @xmath87 instead of both halves being turned by @xmath0 in opposite directions as was done in the previous section .",
    "the choice of how we perform the rotation is irrelevant to our calculation , since the energy associated with each multipole can not depend on the particular spherical coordinate system chosen to perform the spherical harmonic expansion .",
    "however , the true physical process requires both halves to rotate in opposite directions due to the conservation of angular momentum .",
    "in particular , it is evident that the final configuration has no dipole component when @xmath88 is even , since in these cases @xmath89 is symmetric with respect to the equator , and a rotation by @xmath87 of one half of the star will leave the field just as it was at the beginning . for the case of odd @xmath88 , the dipole components @xmath90 that would be produced by that particular multipole after the rotation can be expressed from eq .",
    "( [ clmdef ] ) as @xmath91 where the @xmath92 are associated legendre polynomials ( @xcite ) and @xmath93 contains the result of integrating over @xmath94 , the normalising factors of the spherical harmonics , and an additional factor that relates to the strength of the multipole . due to the orthogonality condition for the associated legendre polynomials ,",
    "@xmath95 is equal to zero , and since @xmath96 ( except for a numerical constant ) , we have @xmath97 where the equality to zero is due to the fact that the @xmath98 are odd functions of @xmath99 for odd @xmath76 .",
    "thus , the dipole component is zero after the rotation , so eq . ( [ condiyey ] ) can be written as @xmath100 due to the conservation of @xmath37 shown in eq .",
    "( [ upsilonconv ] ) , @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 correspond to the initial energies of the dipole and the multipole components , @xmath104 and the initial energy of the system is simply @xmath105 . combining eqs .",
    "( [ finale ] ) and ( [ superfinale ] ) a sufficient condition for the final energy to be smaller than the initial one ( i.e. @xmath106 ) can be obtained , @xmath107 @xmath108 this , however , does not ensure that the initial state is unstable , since the energy might not necessarily be monotonically reduced along the rotation , but it shows that a state with lower energy can exist , even when a significant fraction of the energy is contained in a higher order multipole .",
    "this is particularly true for the quadrupole , in which case eq .",
    "( [ condiwaa ] ) shows that independent of the strength of the quadrupole with respect to the dipole , the final state still has lower energy .",
    "the condition given in eq .",
    "( [ condiwaa ] ) might look very restrictive for multipoles with a very high @xmath88 , but this is only because it is a sufficient but not a necessary condition .",
    "although the overall change in the structure of the star due to the presence of the magnetic field is small , it is not obvious that the energy associated with this perturbation is smaller than that released by the instability just discussed , and can therefore be ignored . to check",
    "if this could in a way stabilise the star against the flowers - ruderman instability , we consider the same displacement , where each half is rotated with respect to the other . as the magnetic energy inside the star and the internal energy of the fluid",
    "will remain the same , we need only to consider the changes in the external magnetic energy , and the gravitational potential energy .",
    "the change in the structure of the star due to the presence of the magnetic field is related to the plasma @xmath109 parameter ( which in our case is @xmath110 ) .",
    "for instance , the displacement of the surface of the star compared to the perfectly spherical one is of order @xmath111 .",
    "the change in the external field between both situations is due to the small perturbation of the surface , which scales like @xmath112 , so , if we use @xmath113 to denote the field in the case where the perturbation to sphericity is ignored , and @xmath114 to denote the case where the perturbation to sphericity is considered , we should have that @xmath115 .",
    "the energy associated with the external field , if we were to consider the change in the structure of the star , would only be a correction of order @xmath116 , so , it can be safely ignored .",
    "we require a slightly more intricate argument to show that the change in the gravitational potential energy during the rotation can be ignored .",
    "consider the star as composed of four different mass distributions , by considering each half separately , and furthermore , by taking each half as composed of a spherical distribution of mass plus a small perturbation due to the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "the spherical distribution would have a density @xmath117 , while the perturbation @xmath118 would be of order @xmath119 .",
    "the total gravitational potential energy of the system can then be decomposed in several terms , four corresponding to the individual gravitational energy of each mass distribution , and twelve more related to the interactions of each mass distribution with the other three .",
    "of course , when performing the rotation of one half of the star with respect to the other , the gravitational energy of each of the four elements remains the same , and the only possible change is due to the interactions between them , which can be treated case by case , as follows :    1 .",
    "first , we take the potential energy due to the interaction among the spherical mass distributions . when one half rotates with respect to the other ,",
    "the system is equivalent to the initial one , so this does not produce a change in the potential energy of the system .",
    ", we consider the interaction between a spherical mass distribution and the perturbation of a spherical mass distribution . in this case",
    ", a rotation of one half leaves the system composed of these two parts in a state that is equivalent to the initial one , and differs only by a rotation of the whole system .",
    "thus , the gravitational energy in this case remains the same .",
    "3 .   finally , we take the interaction between the two perturbations to the spherical mass distributions . in this case , after the rotation , the system is generally not equivalent to the initial one .",
    "the mass associated with each distribution is @xmath120 , so the potential energy associated with their interaction is of order @xmath121 and , since @xmath122 , @xmath123 so the change in the gravitational potential can in fact be ignored compared with the change in the external magnetic energy .",
    "of course , an exact solid body rotation of each half is not really expected to happen when the star is not spherical , since that would produce some `` rough edges '' .",
    "but , since the perturbation of sphericity can be ignored in that case , we expect a more reasonable displacement that closely resembles the rotation of each half with respect to the other to exist and reduce the energy even further .",
    "using mhd perturbation theory , we should also be able to prove the existence of the flowers - ruderman instability .",
    "this proof however could not be as complete as the one given in ",
    "[ far::proofex ] , since perturbation theory can only be used to see if the system is unstable against small displacements , and thus , we can not prove with this approach that the energy decreases monotonically along the entire rotation .",
    "nevertheless , we now provide a proof of the instability for a particular family of fields using perturbation theory , since the results obtained in doing so will be useful in the next section , where we will require the result for the energy perturbation in terms of the angle @xmath56 by which both halves of the star are rotated .    in  [ far::cvol ] ,",
    "we prove that the volume contribution to the potential energy perturbation is equal to zero . in  [ far::csur ] , we calculate the contribution to the potential energy perturbation due to surface currents and show that the final result directly relates with the energy given in eq .",

    "as this perturbation happens with a much stronger toroidal field , it seems to indicate that the perturbation we are studying is not the dominant one , since other instabilities are present for the poloidal field even when the toroidal field is strong enough to stabilise it against the one we have studied .",
    "some authors , for instance , @xcite and @xcite , have stated that a second cut in a direction perpendicular to the first one would produce a configuration which resembles an octupole .",

    "even though we only showed a particular sequence of cuts that transforms the quadrupole into an octupole , clearly this can not be achieved by a single cut , and it does not seem plausible that this can be done without increasing the external magnetic energy at some point , so we expect this mechanism to affect only the initial axisymmetric field .",
    "@xcite presented an argument that shows how purely poloidal fields in stars are unstable .",
    "if the external field is similar to a dipole , one could cut the star in half and rotate each piece in opposite directions , leading to a configuration in which the external field resembles a quadrupole , and thus , the energy of the external magnetic field should be significantly reduced .",

    "in this work , we presented a formal proof of this mechanism for the case in which the initial field outside the star is that of a point dipole , by computing the energy of the external field along the entire rotation .",

    "the result obtained for the potential energy perturbation of the star was found to be consistent with the exact value of the energy previously found .",
    "we then studied how a toroidal field could stabilise the star against the flowers - ruderman instability .",
    "since a sharp cut through the star would split toroidal field lines , the rotation has to be carried out with a continuous displacement field that switches the orientation of rotation across a thin region . for a specific model",

    ".    however , the critical value for the ratio @xmath4 we obtained is not a very accurate measure of the stability of the system against the perturbation we treated , since the contribution to the potential energy perturbation comes from different sources which do not necessarily scale with the energy of the poloidal field .",
