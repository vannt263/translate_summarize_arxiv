    "the recent experimental advances on cold atoms in optical cavities @xcite , bose - einstein condensation of exciton polaritons @xcite , and observation of vacuum rabi oscillations @xcite in semiconductor microcavities renewed interest in light - matter interaction in the quantum coherent regime .",
    "these studies were motivated by an observation made by dicke @xcite long ago who realized that radiation from @xmath0 identical two - level systems ( spins 1/2 ) can not be treated as a sum of @xmath0 independent radiative processes but rather as a collective quantum phenomenon that involves all @xmath0 spins and a photon mode even on the level of perturbation theory . also , several schemes based on light - matter interaction to couple spatially separated spins that had been originally proposed as an element of a quantum computing device @xcite were recently improved by a suggestion to use qubits constructed out of many spins to enhance coupling with the optical mode @xcite due to the superradiant effect .",
    "for instance , considerable attention was paid experimantally to the @xmath5-enhancement of the light - matter coupling @xcite . in typical set - ups",
    "the spins are spatially separated , therefore the excitation energies of different spins may be different as they are affected by local forces that typically vary across the sample .",
    "the coupling strength to the light mode also varies as different spins are located at different positions of the mode due to a different amplitude of the electromagnetic field .",
    "understanding of such inhomogeneities is important to find the practical limitations on the decoherence time of the system when , for instance , one designs a quantum computing device @xcite .",
    "also , the inhomogeneities are unavoidable and should be important in a system like a semiconductor quantum dot optical amplifier or laser @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the homogeneous dicke model , which describes a bath of @xmath0 equivalent spins-1/2 with excitation ( zeeman ) energy @xmath6 coupled to a quantized bosonic mode @xmath7 with the same coupling constants @xmath8 , was diagonalized exactly in ref . .",
    "the influence of inhomogeneities of the coupling constants @xmath9 and zeeman energies @xmath10 on the single excitation dynamics was analyzed exactly in refs . .",
    "it was shown that the boson occupation oscillates in time with a single rabi frequency @xmath11 , where @xmath4 is an effective coupling when only the coupling constants @xmath9 are inhomogeneous but with constant zeeman energies . if the zeeman energies @xmath10 are also inhomogeneous but spread narrower than the threshold given by @xmath12 this single frequency acquires a small lamb - like shift , whereas for a spread exceeding @xmath12 the boson decays completely in time .    in this paper",
    "we show that the solution to the classical hamilton equations of motion matches the solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation when the number of spins is large , i.e. @xmath1 , while the number of excitations @xmath13 is still small , i.e. @xmath14 . for a single excitation ( @xmath15 ) the leading order in an @xmath2-expansion of the classical equations agrees with the quantum one .",
    "for a few excitations such correspondence does not hold , but for @xmath16 the numerical solutions of both classical equations of motion and schrdinger equation agree for @xmath1 .",
    "it is plausible to assume that in leading @xmath2-order the same correspondence holds for @xmath17 .",
    "the numerical treatment of the schrdinger equation with a large number of spins is possible since the fock space scales only as a power of @xmath0 ( @xmath18 ) in the few - excitation subspaces .",
    "as the classical equations of motion for @xmath19 can also be mapped on the schrdinger equation in the single excitation subspace in leading @xmath2-order the already available quantum result can be used to analyze the classical equations of motion for few excitations ( @xmath14 ) . for @xmath13 excitations with @xmath19",
    "we obtain the dynamics by simply rescaling the solution derived in @xcite by @xmath13 .",
    "this extends the single - excitation quantum solution to the case of few excitations when @xmath1 .    to assess the validity of the classical approximation for @xmath19 excitations we solve the schrdinger equation exactly in the two - excitation subspace with inhomogeneity in the coupling constants only and compare it with the classical solution .",
    "when @xmath0 is small both solutions are completely different . for large @xmath0",
    "we perform an @xmath2-expansion of the quantum solution and recover the classical result in leading order . subleading @xmath2-corrections cause deviations between quantum and classical dynamics which become significant at a large time scale @xmath3 for @xmath14 .",
    "we refer to this time scale as an ehrenfest time , defined here as the time where the quantum dynamics starts to differ from the classical dynamics .",
    "also , having found a quantum solution for @xmath20 we study it separately and in particular compare it with the @xmath15 quantum dynamics .",
    "we find that inhomogeneity of the coupling constants results in a different spectrum when @xmath0 is finite : in the subspace with @xmath15 there is only one harmonic mode with a single frequency in the time - dependent occupation number of the boson , and for @xmath20 there are @xmath0 discrete harmonic modes that form a continuum spectrum in the limit of large @xmath0 .",
    "such a mechanism can lead to destructive interference , thus to decay , of the excitations caused solely by the inhomogeneity of the coupling constants when @xmath19 .",
    "but , as pointed out already , for @xmath20 we find that the leading @xmath2-term recovers the single frequency dynamics in accordance with the classical solution .",
    "the decay due to inhomogeneous coupling constants thus manifests itself only in the first subleading @xmath2-correction .",
    "we find that this contribution is an oscillatory mode with frequency @xmath21 and a slowly decaying envelope .",
    "the decay behavior is essentially non - exponential with a long power - law tail and the decay time is @xmath22 , where @xmath4 is a characteristic coupling .",
    "this decay occurs on the same time scale as the ehrenfest time @xmath23 defined above .",
    "thus , it can be described correctly only by the schrdinger equation ( and not by the classical one ) .    in our theoretical analysis",
    "we assume the following ideal experiment . the spin bath is prepared in the ground state , e.g. dynamically or by the thermal cooling .",
    "the non - equilibrium dynamics of the boson is then initialized by a short radiation pulse from an external source which populates the boson mode with a few excitations like in @xcite .",
    "the dissipation of the boson mode , e.g. leakage of the photons through the mirrors that define an optical cavity can be used to detect the dynamics , similarly to the measurements performed on semiconductor quantum well microcavities@xcite , for the limiting case where the cavity leakage time exceeds the internal time scale .",
