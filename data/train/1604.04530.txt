    "brownian motion in disordered media ( or rugged energy landscapes ) is a problem of great scientific and technological interest , and applications are found in a wide range of different areas , such as e.g.  collective transport of particles in random media @xcite , molecular motors  @xcite , and protein reaction dynamics and folding  @xcite , to name but a few . in the latter example in particular , proteins are dynamic macromolecules that exhibit many scales of molecular motion which is governed by a hopping mechanism through the local minima of the free - energy surface , the so - called conformational substrates or microstates . understanding the effect of the microstates on the large scale dynamics of proteins is a problem of both theoretical and practical interest . at the same time",
    ", a rugged energy landscape can introduce metastability in the system  @xcite and the degree of metastability can increase with the complexity of the landscape , invalidating predictions based on thermodynamic arguments , e.g.  @xcite .",

    "it is important to note that many interesting phenomena , such as subdiffusion , may arise in the coarse grained dynamics systems with a multiscale potential , and , as it was shown in @xcite , the presence of a microscale (  roughness \" ) in the potential decreases the mean first passage time . in particular , given a potential @xmath2 with two metastable states , perturbing @xmath2 with microscale fluctuations would result in a decrease in the escape / reaction rate between the two states , see also @xcite . such results can be obtained in a systematic and rigorous way using analytical multiscale techniques .",
    "one can also approximate the effective dynamics numerically , using methods such as heterogeneous multiscale methods  @xcite , reduced basis finite element heterogeneous multiscale methods , @xcite , as well as equation - free methods  @xcite . here , we further assume an overdamped langevin dynamics of a brownian particle moving in a multiscale periodic potential , where the macroscale is assumed to be confining ( see figure [ fig : potentials ] for some examples of multiscale potentials ) . by carefully analysing the corresponding effective ( averaged ) equation in different examples of potentials we are able to observe nontrivial dynamics which emerges as a consequence of the interplay between noise level and microscopic structure . in particular , we find that the microscopic fluctuations conspire with the additive noise to produce noise - induced hysteresis and noise - induced stabilisation depending on the particular choice of the potential . in all cases , we are able to fully characterise the different state transitions in terms of critical exponents",
