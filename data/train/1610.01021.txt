    "the lagrange - mesh method  @xcite is a simple and often accurate method for solving quantum - mechanical problems .",
    "it can be seen as an approximate variational calculation using a basis of lagrange functions associated with a mesh and the gauss quadrature associated with this mesh to evaluate most of the matrix elements . for reasons",
    "not perfectly understood  @xcite , the lagrange - mesh method is in many applications as accurate as the corresponding variational approach .",
    "however , the success of the lagrange - mesh method relies ultimately on the validity of the gauss quadrature .",
    "therefore , when the quality of the gauss - quadrature approximation is poor , the lagrange - mesh method is inaccurate . in particular",
    ", it happens when the potential is singular but surprisingly , only for the lowest partial waves  @xcite .",
    "for some problems , the high accuracy of the lagrange - mesh method can be restored by means of a regularization technique  @xcite . for other problems ,",
    "such a regularization technique is not available , yet .",
    "it is the case for instance for the study of a coulomb system with more than three particles . in the case of three particles ,",
    "the presence of singularities in the potential restricts the high quality of the lagrange - mesh method to some specific systems of coordinates  @xcite . a better understanding of the regularization process , its effects and its necessity , could help to develop new regularization techniques and thus , broaden the scope of applicability of the lagrange - mesh method .    in this paper , a regularized lagrange mesh based on orthonormal lagrange - laguerre functions is developed and applied to bound - state calculations .",
    "a comparison with other lagrange meshes provides interesting insight into the regularization process .",
    "the lagrange - mesh method is also extended to the phase - shift calculations by evaluating integral relations derived from the kohn variational principle and adapted from  @xcite .",
    "the integral relations are computed with the gauss quadrature associated with the lagrange mesh , which make their evaluation particularly easy .",
    "the accuracy of the approach is analyzed .    in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] , the application of the lagrange - mesh method to the study of bound states and to the calculation of phase shifts is outlined .",

    "finally , in the appendix , the lagrange - mesh method is applied to a somehow exotic but illuminating problem : the study of bound states in a two dimensional space .",

    "the potential @xmath2 is assumed to have singularities , if any , only at the origin ( @xmath9 ) or at infinity ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "moreover , at the origin , the potential @xmath2 is assumed to be less singular than the centrifugal term , @xmath11 with these hypotheses , the radial wave function behaves at the origin as @xmath12 let us first consider a purely discrete spectrum .",
    "equation  ( [ sch ] ) can be solved approximately by expanding the radial wave function @xmath13 in some set of square - integrable functions @xmath14 , @xmath15 then , the energies and the coefficients @xmath16 are determined variationally by solving the generalized eigenvalue problem @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "the eigenvalue problem is not generalized if the norm matrix is the identity , i.e. , if the functions @xmath19 are orthonormal .",
    "now , let us consider that the potential @xmath20 tends asymptotically to the coulomb potential @xmath21 , @xmath22 \\mathop{\\longrightarrow}\\limits_{r\\to\\infty } 0,\\ ] ] where the coulomb potential is given by @xmath23 with parameter @xmath24 .",
    "this potential has a possible discrete spectrum of negative energies and a continuum spectrum of positive energies .",

    "the solutions of ( [ eigen ] ) with negative energies are again variational approximations of the bound - state wave functions while the solutions of ( [ eigen ] ) with positive energies correspond to pseudostates , which are square - integrable approximations of continuum states .",
    "although these pseudostates do not have the proper asymptotic behavior ( [ asymp ] ) of a positive - energy wave function , they can be used to determine the phase shift via integral relations derived from the kohn variational principle  @xcite , @xmath31 u_{k\\ell}(r ) f_\\ell(\\eta , k r ) \\rmd r } { \\int^\\infty_0 [ v(r)-v_c(r ) ] u_{k\\ell}(r ) \\tilde{g}_\\ell(\\eta , k r ) \\rmd r+i_\\gamma},\\ ] ] where @xmath32 with @xmath33 is a regularization of the irregular coulomb function @xmath30 and @xmath34 - 2 ( 1-\\rme^{-\\gamma r})\\frac{\\rmd}{\\rmd r}\\right\\}g_\\ell(\\eta , k r ) \\rmd r.\\end{aligned}\\]][ig ] indeed , the integrals in ( [ kvp ] ) and ( [ ig ] ) are short - ranged and therefore , only the internal part of the wave function has to be described accurately to provide accurate phase shifts .",
    "relation  ( [ kvp ] ) is a straightforward generalization for an arbitrary angular momentum of relations given in @xcite . in theory , this relation is valid for any positive value of @xmath35 , including @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "however , in practice , the radial wave function is not known exactly and some approximation of @xmath38 , in a finite basis for instance , like ( [ uexp ] ) , is used . in this case ,",
    "relation ( [ kvp ] ) is only accurate for some range of @xmath35 values .",
    "several @xmath35 values need to be tested to find a plateau where the sensitivity of the results to the @xmath35 parameter is weak .",
    "this sensitivity study gives a valuable information about the numerical accuracy of the phase shift which is reached for a particular calculation .    in this work",
    ", the radial wave function @xmath13 is expanded in a lagrange basis  @xcite .",
    "such a basis is associated with a set of @xmath39 mesh points @xmath40 and the gauss quadrature associated with this mesh .",
    "each lagrange function vanishes at all mesh points except one , @xmath41 where the constants @xmath42 are the weights of the gauss quadrature associated with the mesh , @xmath43 the abscissae @xmath44 and the weights @xmath45 of the gauss quadrature are defined implicitly by the relations @xmath46 which are to be true for any polynomial @xmath47 of degree lower than or equal to @xmath48 .",

    ", the term _ singularity _ means that in the matrix element , the integrand divided by the weight function @xmath49 associated with the gauss quadrature is singular .",
