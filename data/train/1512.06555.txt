    "the amadeus experiment @xcite deals with the study of the low - energy interactions of the negatively charged kaons with light nuclei . such type of physics , extremely important for the understanding of the non - perturbative qcd in the strangeness sector , has important consequences , going from hadron and nuclear physics to astrophysics . in this context",
    ", useful information can be obtained from the strength of the @xmath1 binding in nuclei .",
    "the investigation of the absorptions of @xmath1 inside the kloe drift chamber ( dc ) was originally motivated by the prediction of the formation of deeply bound kaonic nuclear states @xcite .",
    "their binding energies and widths could be determined by studying their decays into hyperons and nucleons .",
    "also intimately connected with the kaon - nucleon potential is the @xmath6 resonance , of which the still puzzling nature can be investigated within amadeus @xcite .",
    "the study of the kn interaction at low energies is of interest not only for quantifying the meson - baryon potential with strange content , but also because of its impact on models describing the structure of neutron stars ( ns ) @xcite .",
    "the kn potential is attractive , as theory predicts @xcite and kaonic atoms confirm @xcite , and this fact leads to the formulation of hypotheses about antikaon role inside the dense interior of neutron stars ; one or more nucleons could be kept together by the strong attractive interaction between antikaons and nucleons and the so - called kaonic bound states , as @xmath7 or @xmath8 , might be formed .",
    "the observation of such states and the measurements of their binding energies and widths , would provide a quantitative measurement of the kn interaction in vacuum , representing an important reference for the investigation of the in - medium properties of kaons . from the experimental point of view",
    ", two main approaches have been used for studying the @xmath9 cluster : @xmath10-@xmath10 and heavy ion collisions @xcite @xcite , and in - flight or stopped @xmath1 interactions in light nuclei . for the second",
    ", results have been published by the finuda @xcite and kek - ps e549 collaborations @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of both results is far from being conclusive , and it requires an accurate description of the single and multi - nucleon absorption processes that a @xmath1 would undergo when interacting with light nuclei . from the analysis of the kloe 2004 - 2005 , information on both the strength of the @xmath1 binding in nuclei and the in - medium modification of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 resonances properties can be extracted by analysing , respectively , the @xmath13 channels and at the resonances decay channels @xmath14 . in this paper",
    "we focus , in particular , on the analysis of the @xmath15 final state produced in absorption processes of @xmath1 on two or more nucleons , occurring in the kloe dc entrance wall , and on the search for a signature of the @xmath16 kaonic bound state .",
    "a more detailed description of the analysis procedures can be found in @xcite .",
    "da@xmath0ne @xcite ( double anular @xmath0-factory for nice experiments ) is a double ring @xmath17 collider , designed to work at the center of mass energy of the @xmath18 particle @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath18 meson decay produces charged kaons ( with br(@xmath20 ) = @xmath21 ) with low momentum ( @xmath22 @xmath23 ) which is ideal either to stop them , or to explore the products of the low - energy nuclear absorptions of @xmath1s .",
    "the kloe detector @xcite is centered around the interaction region of da@xmath0ne and is characterised by a @xmath24 geometry and an acceptance of @xmath25 ; it consists of a large cylindrical drift chamber ( dc ) and a fine sampling lead - scintillating fibers calorimeter , all immersed in an axial magnetic field of 0.52 t , provided by a superconducting solenoid .",
    "the dc @xcite has an inner radius of 0.25 m , an outer radius of 2 m and a length of 3.3 m. the dc entrance wall composition is 750 @xmath26 of carbon fibre and 150 @xmath26 of aluminium foil .",
    "dedicated geant montecarlo simulations of the kloe apparatus were performed to estimate the percentages of @xmath1 absorptions in the materials of the dc entrance wall ( the @xmath1 absorption physics were treated by the geisha package ) .",
    "out of the total number of kaons interacting in the dc entrance wall , about 81@xmath27 results to be absorbed in the carbon fibre component and the residual 19@xmath27 in the aluminium foil .",
    "the kloe dc is filled with a mixture of helium and isobutane ( 90@xmath27 in volume @xmath28he and 10@xmath27 in volume @xmath29 ) .",
    "the chamber is characterised by excellent position and momentum resolutions .",
    "tracks are reconstructed with a resolution in the transverse @xmath30 plane of @xmath31 and a resolution along the z - axis of @xmath32 .",
    "the transverse momentum resolution for low momentum tracks ( @xmath33 ) is @xmath34 .",
    "the kloe calorimeter @xcite is composed of a cylindrical barrel and two endcaps , providing a solid angle coverage of 98% .",
    "the volume ratio ( lead / fibres / glue=42:48:10 ) is optimised for a high light yield and a high efficiency for photons in the range ( 20 - 300 ) @xmath23 .",
    "the position of the cluster along the fibres can be obtained with a resolution @xmath35 .",
    "the resolution in the orthogonal direction is @xmath36 .",
    "the energy and time resolutions for photon clusters are given by @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "as a step 0 of amadeus , we analysed the 2004 - 2005 kloe collected data , for which the @xmath39 information of the reconstructed tracks is available ( @xmath39 represents the truncated mean of the adc collected counts due to the ionisation in the dc gas )",
    ". an important contribution of in - flight @xmath1 nuclear captures , in different nuclear targets from the kloe materials , was evidenced and characterised , enabling to perform invariant mass spectroscopy of in - flight @xmath1 nuclear captures @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the negatively charged kaons interactions in nuclear matter is performed through the reconstruction of hyperon - pion and hyperon - nucleon / nucleus correlated pairs productions , following the @xmath1 absorptions in h , @xmath40he , @xmath41be and @xmath42c .",
    "the investigation of the @xmath1 multi - nucleon absorptions and the properties of possible antikaon multi - nucleon bound states proceeds through the analyses of the @xmath13 , correlations ; this last channel is , in particular , extremely promising for the search and characterisation in different nuclear targets of the extremely rare four nucleon absorption process .",
    "the search for the @xmath6 is performed through its decay into @xmath43 ( purely isospin i=0 ) and @xmath44 ( also the analysis of the @xmath45 decay channel started recently with a characterisation of neutron clusters in the kloe calorimeter ) .",
    "the line shapes of the three combinations @xmath46 were recently obtained , for the first time , in a photoproduction experiment @xcite ; as the line - shapes of the three invariant mass spectra were found to be different , a comparative study with @xmath47 production is of extreme interest . moreover",
    ", a precise measurement of the @xmath48 production ratio in different targets can unveil the nature of the @xmath12 state , by observing modifications of its parameters as a function of the density @xcite .",
    "to conclude , given the excellent resolution for the @xmath49 invariant mass , the analysis of the @xmath49 ( isospin i=1 ) production , both from direct formation process and from internal conversion of a primary produced @xmath50 hyperon ( @xmath51 ) is presently ongoing .",
    "our aim is to measure , for the first time , the module of the non - resonant transition amplitude ( compared with the resonant @xmath52 ) below threshold .",
    "the presence of a hyperon always represents the signature of a @xmath1 hadronic interaction inside the kloe setup materials .",
    "most of the analyses introduced in the previous section then start with the identification of a @xmath53 , through the reconstruction of the @xmath54 ( br = 63.9 @xmath55 ) decay vertex . in figure [ lmass ]",
    "left the @xmath39 versus momentum scatterplot for the finally selected protons is shown , where the function used for the selection of protons is displayed in red .",
    "the typical signature of pions in @xmath39 versus momentum can be also seen in figure [ lmass ] left illustrating the efficient rejection of @xmath56 contamination in a broad range of momentum .",
    "a minimum track length of 30 cm is required , and a common vertex is searched for all the @xmath57 pairs in each event . when found , the common vertex position is added as an additional constraint for the track refitting .",
    "the module of the momentum and the vector cosines are redefined for both tracks , taking into account for the energy loss in the gas and the various crossed materials ( signal and field wires , dc wall , beam pipe ) when tracks are extrapolated back through the detector . as a final step for the identification of @xmath58 decays ,",
    "the vertices are cross checked with quality cuts using the minimum distance between tracks ( minimum distance @xmath59 3.2 cm ) and the chi - square of the vertex fit . a spatial resolution below 1 mm",
    "is achieved for vertices found inside the dc volume ( evaluated with monte carlo ) .",
    "the invariant mass @xmath60 , calculated under the @xmath10 and @xmath61 mass hypothesis , is shown in figure [ lmass ] right .",
    "the gaussian fit gives a mass of 1115.723 @xmath62 0.003 @xmath63 and an excellent resolution ( @xmath64 ) of 0.3 @xmath63 , confirming the unique performances of kloe for charged particles ( the systematics , depending on the momentum calibration of the kloe setup , are presently under evaluation ) .",
    "rl    this is the common procedure for all the analysed channels starting with the initial search of a @xmath58 as a signature for the hadronic interaction of the @xmath1 .",
    "cuts on the radial position ( @xmath65 ) of the @xmath58 decay vertex were optimised in order to separate the two samples of @xmath1 absorption events occurring in the dc wall and the dc gas : @xmath66 cm and @xmath67 cm , respectively .",
    "the @xmath65 limits were set based on mc simulations and a study of the @xmath58 decay path .",
    "in particular , the @xmath66 cm cut guarantees , for the first sample , a contamination of @xmath1 interactions in gas as low as @xmath68 .",
    "after the @xmath58 search , a common vertex between the @xmath58 candidate and an additional proton track is searched for .",
    "the obtained resolution on the radial coordinate for the @xmath69 vertex is 12 mm , while its invariant mass resolution is found to be , from mc studies , equal to @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath5 candidates are identified through their decay into @xmath71 pairs . after the reconstruction of a @xmath69 pair , the photon selection is carried out via its identidication in the emc .",
    "photon candidates are selected by applying a cut on the difference between the emc time measurement and the expected time of arrival of the photon within @xmath72 .",
    "then , the @xmath15 invariant mass , opening angle , and the individual @xmath5 and proton momenta distributions are considered simultaneously in a global fit to extract the contributions of the various absorption processes .",
    "the processes that are taken into account in the fit of the experimental data are :    * @xmath73 * @xmath74 * @xmath75 * @xmath76    where a is the atomic number of the target nucleus , @xmath77 is the spectator proton , a is the atomic number of the residual nucleus and 2/3/4na stands for 2/3/4-nucleons absorption .",
    "this list includes the @xmath1 absorption on two nucleons with and without final state interaction ( fsi ) for the @xmath15 state and processes involving more than two nucleons in the initial state .",
    "these contributions are either extracted from experimental data samples or modelled via simulations .",
    "two kinds of background contribute to the analysed @xmath15 final state : the machine background and the events with @xmath78 in the final state .",
    "both are quantified using experimental data @xcite .",
    "the obtained fit is shown in figure [ fitnobs ] and the results are summarised in table [ tabfitnobs ] .",
    "invariant mass , @xmath79 and proton momentum together with the results of the global fit .",
    "the experimental data after the subtraction of the machine background are shown by the black circles , the systematic errors are represented by the boxes and the coloured histograms correspond to the fitted signal distributions where the light - coloured bands show the fit errors and the darker bands represent the symmetrised systematic errors .",
    "the gray line show the total fit distributions ( see @xcite for details).,width=415 ]    .production probability of the @xmath15 final state for different intermediate processes normalised to the number of stopped @xmath1 in the dc wall .",
    "the statistical and systematic errors are shown as well @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tabfitnobs ]    the final fit results deliver the contributions of the different channels to the analysed @xmath15 final state .",
    "the best fit delivers a @xmath80 of 0.85 .",
    "the emission rates extracted from the fit are normalised to the total number of stopped antikaons .",
    "the fit results lead to the first measurements of the genuine 2na - qf for the final state @xmath15 in reactions of stopped @xmath1 on targets of @xmath4 and @xmath81 .",
    "this contribution is found to be only 12% of the total absorption cross - section .",
    "the last step of the analysis consists in the search of the @xmath7 bound state produced in @xmath1 interaction with nuclear targets , decaying into a @xmath15 pair .",
    "the @xmath7 are simulated similarly to the 2na - qf process but sampling the mass of the @xmath7 state with a breit - wigner distribution , rather than the fermi momenta of the two nucleons in the initial state .",
    "the event kinematic is obtained by imposing the momentum conservation of the @xmath7 residual nucleus system .",
    "different values for the binding energy and width varying within @xmath82 and @xmath83 in steps of 15 and 20 @xmath63 , respectively , are tested .",
    "this range has been selected according to several theoretical predictions present in literature and taking into account the experimental resolution .",
    "the global fit is repeated adding the @xmath7 .",
    "the best fit ( @xmath84 ) is obtained for a @xmath7 candidate with a binding energy of @xmath85 and a width of @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "figure [ fitbs ] shows the results of the best fit for the @xmath15 invariant mass and proton momentum distributions where the @xmath7 bound state contribution is shown in green .",
    "invariant mass and proton momentum distributions together with the results of the global fit including the @xmath7 .",
    "the different contributions are labeled as in figure [ fitnobs ] and the green histograms represent the @xmath7 signal , width=415 ]    the resulting yield normalised to the number of stopped @xmath1 is @xmath87 .",
    "the f - test conducted to compare the simulation models with and without the @xmath7 signal gave a significance of the result of only 1@xmath64 for the @xmath7 yield result @xcite .",
    "this shows that although the measured spectra are compatible with the hypothesis of a contribution of a deeply bound state , the significance of the result is not sufficient to claim the discovery of this state .",
    "the broad experimental program of amadeus , dealing with the non - perturbative qcd in the strangeness sector , is supported by the quest for high precision and statistics measurements , able to set more stringent constraints on the existing theoretical models .",
    "we demonstrated the capabilities of the kloe detector to perform high quality physics ( taking advantage of the unique features of the da@xmath0ne factory ) in the open sector of strangeness nuclear physics .",
    "our investigations , presently spread on a wide spectrum of physical processes , represent the most ambitious and systematic effort in this field . in particular , in this report we have presented the analysis of the @xmath1 absorption processes leading to the @xmath5p state measured with the kloe detector .",
    "it was shown that the full kinematics of this final state can be reconstructed and a global fit of the kinematic variables allows to pin down quantitatively the various contributing processes .",
    "also , the possibility to accomodate a signal from a @xmath7 bound state has been investigated .",
    "we proved the possibility to deliver very accurate and valuable results in the stangeness sector , in particular for what concerns the comprehension of the kn potential , by studying all the possible channels following a @xmath1 absorption on one or several nucleons , for very low momentum kaons .",
    "for the future , a dedicated amadeus setup , with dedicated gaseous and solid targets , where to enhance the fraction of stopped kaons , is under study .",
