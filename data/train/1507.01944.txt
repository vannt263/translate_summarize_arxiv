    "there is an ongoing debate in the astrophysical community on how to interpret the measured spectra of the atmospheres of exoplanets .",

    "this approach has the advantage that it is grounded by the laws of physics and chemistry ( radiative and chemical equilibria ) .",

    "this approach is sound when remote sensing and in - situ measurements are available , such as for the earth and the solar system bodies , but its robustness is not assured when scrutinizing distant , unresolved point sources of light .",
    "for example , workers enforce global energy conservation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but this does not guarantee _ local _ energy conservation ( radiative equilibrium ; see appendix ) .",
    "generally , the robustness of an interpretation via retrieval depends on the prior knowledge that one is assuming about the atmosphere ",

    "furthermore , if the inert gas of the atmosphere is a mixture of hydrogen and helium , we assume that atmospheric escape does not act to remove hydrogen , leaving behind a helium - dominated atmosphere that may contain more carbon dioxide than water @xcite .      to move forward , it would be useful to uncover generic physical and chemical trends that one may insert into these inversion techniques as priors . in the current paper",

    "they are not ad hoc fitting or parametric functions , which are commonly used in retrieval models .",
    "rather , they are first - principle calculations with simplifying approximations taken , the most major of which is that starlight and thermal emission are grouped into separate wavebands .",
    "in figure [ fig : abundances ] , we show calculations of the mixing ratios of carbon dioxide , carbon monoxide , water , methane and acetylene . we set @xmath84 , which is the approximate value at the solar photosphere . for a sub - solar carbon abundance ( @xmath89 ) , water is the dominant molecule regardless of temperature @xcite .",
    "methane dominates carbon monoxide at low temperatures @xcite and the trend reverses at high temperatures depending on the pressure @xcite .",
    "carbon dioxide is dominated by methane at low temperatures , but the trend reverses in a pressure - independent manner , because the number of reactants ( two ) versus products ( two ) is the same in the chemical reaction involving the production of carbon dioxide .",
    "acetylene always remains subdominant in a carbon - poor environment .",
    "as we increase c / o to 1 , 10 and 100 , the system becomes water - poor @xcite .",
    "the trend between methane and carbon monoxide persists in a qualitative sense , but the transition occurs at different temperatures . at high temperatures ,",
    "acetylene starts to dominate both methane and carbon dioxide @xcite .",
    "a key limitation of our approach is that graphite starts to condense out of the gas when the carbon - to - oxygen ratio and/or metallicity are greatly enhanced @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite have shown that , at @xmath90 bar , graphite formation occurs at @xmath91 and @xmath92 k when the metallicity is 300 times above solar ; their figure 7 also shows that , at solar @xmath93 , graphite forms when the metallicity is 1000 times solar and @xmath94 k. generally , graphite formation and rain out are expected to maintain the gas - phase @xmath93 near unity ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we note that @xcite also did not include graphite formation in their calculations .      in figure",
    "[ fig : ratios ] , we divide the mixing ratio of carbon dioxide by that of the other molecules .",
    "the striking thing we notice is that carbon dioxide is always subdominant compared to carbon monoxide and water , across the entire range of temperatures considered , and for @xmath89 , 1 , 10 and 100 .",
    "physically , the relative scarcity of carbon dioxide stems from the fact that it both requires the production of carbon monoxide and successfully competing with it _ and _ water for oxygen atoms .",
    "furthermore , @xmath95 is insensitive to pressure for the reason previously mentioned , unless acetylene starts to become dominant .",
    "by contrast , a higher pressure favors the product of methane over carbon dioxide as the reverse reaction is favored , because the number of products ( four ) exceeds the number of reactants ( two)this is a manifestation of le chtelier s principle .",
    "next , we wish to compute the abundance of carbon dioxide relative to carbon monoxide and water in model atmospheres and fully explore the effects of pressure variations .",
    "we pick @xmath7 for illustration . in figure",
    "[ fig : tp ] , we create temperature - pressure profiles of model atmospheres with three different equilibrium temperatures : @xmath96 , 1200 and 2500 k. these values are representative of a broad range of currently characterisable exoplanetary atmospheres from gj 436b to hd 189733b to wasp-12b . for our other parameters ,",

    "@xmath100 @xmath101 g@xmath58 and @xmath102 @xmath101 g@xmath58 . these choices imply that the infrared photosphere resides at a pressure of @xmath103 starlight is mostly deposited at a pressure of @xmath104 @xcite . for each value of @xmath82",
    ", we create three variations : pure absorption , a finite bond albedo ( which we set to @xmath83 ) and a temperature inversion ( which we create by doubling the value of the visible opacity to @xmath105 @xmath101 g@xmath58 ) .",
    "this gives us a total of 9 model atmospheres .",
    "for each model atmosphere , we calculate @xmath95 and @xmath106 . across all 9 models ( see figure [ fig : tp ] ) , we find that the mixing ratio of carbon dioxide is always subdominant , compared to carbon monoxide and water , by at least an order of magnitude  often more .",
    "thus , we have demonstrated the conclusion previously stated in equation ( [ eq : conclusion ] ) , at least for elemental oxygen abundances that are solar .",
    "our chemical - equilibrium calculations do not account for disequilibrium chemistry that may arise from atmospheric mixing .",
    "workers constructing one - dimensional models of the atmosphere have traditionally used a diffusion coefficient , commonly termed an  eddy mixing coefficient \" , to collectively mimic advection , convection , diffusion and turbulence ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in three dimensions , atmospheric circulation hardly resembles diffusion with equator - to - pole circulation cells that penetrate down to @xmath107 bar across the temperature range we are examining @xcite . in the case of gj 436b , the atmospheric circulation penetrates down to only @xmath108 bar @xcite .",
    "( for a review of the atmospheric dynamics of hot exoplanetary atmospheres , see @xcite . )",
    "furthermore , it is often overlooked that the intense stellar heating associated with close - in , transiting exoplanets flattens their temperature - pressure profiles and suppresses convection @xcite .",
    "thus , the association between eddy diffusion / mixing and convection becomes even more tenuous .",
    "nevertheless , for the sake of discussion , we invoke the simplest approach for including atmospheric mixing : the  quenching approximation \" , where one locates the point in the atmosphere where the chemical and dynamical timescales equate . above this point ( i.e. , at lower pressures or higher altitudes )",
    ", the chemical abundances are frozen to their quench - point values .",
    "a caveat is that different chemical species will generally have different quench points .",
    "if carbon dioxide is subdominant compared to carbon monoxide and water _ everywhere _ in the atmosphere , then locating the quench point becomes irrelevant  quenching will not alter this outcome .",
    "generally , the conclusion reached in equation ( [ eq : conclusion ] ) is unaffected by atmospheric dynamics and mixing . for atmospheric mixing to alter our conclusion requires substantially enhanced metallicities _ and _ low temperatures  in  [ subsect : metallicity ] , we will quantify what  substantially enhanced \" and  low \" means .",
    "photochemistry is expected to enhance the production of acetylene @xcite , @xmath109 where the first and second net reactions proceed via the photolysis of carbon monoxide ( into c and o atoms , which act as radicals ) and water ( into the o atom and the oh radical ) , respectively .",
    "the first reaction is relevant only for @xmath110 @xmath47bar , while the second reaction is the dominant one for photospheric pressures @xcite .",
    "the second net reaction is essentially the same as the one we consider in the present study for thermochemistry .",
    "thus , if it is enhanced via photochemistry , then it can only lead to enhanced acetylene production at the expense of carbon dioxide .",
    "overall , the presence of photochemistry strengthens , rather than weakens , our conclusion .      our results , which are analytical except for the use of a numerical solver for the quintic equation , appear to be supported by more sophisticated calculations in the literature that focus on somewhat narrower regimes of parameter space ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "exceptions include @xcite , who focused on the hot neptune gj 436b and studied the effects of enhanced metallicities ; they reported @xmath111 at some locations in their model atmospheres with @xmath112 the solar metallicity .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that carbon dioxide could be the dominant gas by mass , over a temperature range consistent with that found in gj 436b , if the elemental carbon abundance is enhanced by four orders of magnitude over its solar value .",
    "@xcite also noted that @xmath106 increases dramatically with metallicity .",
    "we interpret an enhanced metallicity to be an increased value of the elemental abundance of oxygen ( @xmath113 ) relative to its solar value ( @xmath114 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : gj436 ] , we repeat our calculations for an enhanced metallicity of @xmath112 solar , but we keep the carbon - to - oxygen ratio at its solar value ( @xmath7 ) as metallicity and c / o are independent quantities .",
    "we also focused on a lower temperature range that is representative of gj 436b .",
    "we are thus able to reproduce the same qualitative behavior as @xcite : @xmath111 at @xmath115600 k. the cross - over point appears to occur at about 600 k. despite the enhanced metallicity , our gj 436b - like calculation displays @xmath116 throughout .",

    "we examine pressures of 1 @xmath47bar and 10 bar , because these values bracket the conceivable range of pressures probed by the infrared observations .",
    "we examine pressures up to 10 bar , because this is the maximum depth to which atmospheric circulation penetrates for the range of equilibrium temperatures we are interested in @xcite .",

    "by contrast , @xcite reported that @xmath16 for wasp-12b , but this appears to be based on retrievals that yield @xmath127 , as stated in their table 3 and displayed in their figure 3 .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have claimed that @xcite do not include acetylene or hydrogen cyanide in their analysis , which drives the retrieval calculations to  unrealistically - large \" abundances of co@xmath0 .",
    "it is thus unsurprising that the two sets of authors reach different conclusions regarding the carbon - to - oxygen ratio of wasp-12b , even without discussing the controversy surrounding the data themselves @xcite .",
    "in other words , some of these reported retrievals are chemically impossible ( but see @xcite ) . to be fair , @xcite did remark :",
    " one might question how realistic solutions with such high abundances of co@xmath0 may be . such high co@xmath0 abundances are generally not thermochemically permissible in highly reducing hot - jupiter - like atmospheres .",
    "\" @xcite then performed a separate retrieval analysis by setting a hard limit on the mixing ratio of co@xmath0 to be @xmath128 and found that it has no effect on the ch@xmath1 and co abundances , although the retrieved h@xmath0o abundance is increased by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "@xcite present an improved analysis of the dayside emission of wasp-12b , which included new data from the spitzer space telescope .",
    "they did not enforce the priors in equation ( [ eq : priors ] ) , so as to allow for uncertainties associated with the absorption opacities and for the possibility of enhanced helium abundances .",
    "this permits both physically plausible and implausible retrievals to be reported and for the rejection of implausible solutions after the fact .",
    "@xcite concluded that oxygen - rich atmospheres require implausibly - high abundances of carbon dioxide .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite concluded that the dayside emission spectrum of wasp-12b favors a carbon - rich interpretation .",
    "more recently , @xcite obtained a near - infrared transmission spectrum , which probes a series of water lines originating from the terminators of the atmosphere of wasp-12b , using the wide field camera 3 on the hubble space telescope . using a thermochemically - consistent retrieval analysis",
    ", they ruled out a carbon - rich scenario for the terminator region of wasp-12b at more than @xmath129-level confidence .    within the context of our study",
    ", we find that the atmosphere of wasp-12b is too hot for enhanced metallicity to play a role ( see figures [ fig : tp ] , [ fig : gj436 ] and [ fig : transition ] ) in boosting the co@xmath0 abundance over that of co and h@xmath0o .",
    "if we repeat our calculations in figure [ fig : transition ] for @xmath1303000 k ( not shown ) , we obtain the result that the metallicity needs to be enhanced by about 4 orders of magnitude for wasp-12b  a statement that is independent of pressure , because of the high temperatures involved .",
    "another consequence is that , since @xmath131 appears to vary from @xmath132 to @xmath133 as c / o increases , this pair of molecules may be used as a diagnostic for the carbon - to - oxygen ratio ( see also @xcite ) , although this will be challenging as their spectral lines will probably be dominated by those of the other molecules .",
    "generally , past claims in the literature of @xmath134 and/or @xmath135 should be viewed with skepticism , unless a chemical mechanism ( e.g. , enhanced metallicity at low temperatures ) has been elucidated .",
    "if co@xmath0 is reported to be constrained by a retrieval calculation but co is not , then it should also be viewed skeptically .",
    "the motivation for this study originated from a discussion between kh and nikku madhusudhan during kh s visit to cambridge university in december 2014 .",
