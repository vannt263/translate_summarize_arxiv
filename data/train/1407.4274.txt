    "the statistical analyses were conducted using the wolfram mathematica software , and the computable document format mathematica script used is included as a supplemental file . for the entire dataset , a binwidth of @xmath44 e@xmath7/@xmath8 was found to be optimal , yielding an estimated mean dose of @xmath45 e@xmath7/@xmath8 .",
    "however , note that when the experimental cumulative dose data is plotted along with 20 simulated random poisson processes with the fitted mean , we see that the agreement between the data and the fit is poor due to the influence of high dose events ( ie .",

    "<S> the non - planar si - c@xmath12 configuration can have two distinct positions with respect to the beam direction : the si atom either protrudes ` below ' ( in the instrument geometry ) the plane towards the incoming beam , or ` above ' it along the direction of the beam . </S>",
    "<S> these present different @xmath13 and can not be experimentally distinguished from a 2-dimensional projection of the lattice recorded with a normally incident beam . </S>",
    "<S> however , we suspected that the threshold for flipping a si atom from ` below ' to ` above ' should not be very high even for 60  kev electrons , as no bonds need to be broken for the transformation . </S>",

    "<S> thus all si configurations are effectively ` above ' the graphene plane under observation , and the beam - induced alignment is expected to be thermally stable .    our simulations yield a @xmath13 of approximately 13.25  ev for the si atom bonded in the si - c@xmath12 configuration . however , due to the large mass of si ( 28  amu ) , the probability for 60  kev electrons to transfer this much energy to the dopant is low , resulting in a cross section of 6.6@xmath5 barn when out - of - plane lattice vibrations with a debye temperature of 1287  k are taken into account  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this agrees well with the observation that si atoms are rarely lost  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the knock - on threshold for one of the three c neighbours to si is higher , about 16.875  ev , but leads to a much larger cross section ( @xmath14  barn ) due to the lower mass of c ( unless otherwise stated , we refer to @xmath9c ) . </S>",
    "<S> this process leads to a conversion si - c@xmath12 @xmath15 si - c@xmath16 , which can occur at high irradiation doses .    </S>",
    "<S> more interesting are impacts below @xmath13 , which nevertheless lead to local changes in the structure . for example , energies between 15.0 and 16.25  ev result in the c atom being ejected from the lattice , but with a trajectory curving first slightly away and then towards the si due to their mutual interaction . </S>",

    "<S> is drawn back by the attractive interaction with the si atom to land on top of the lattice on the side opposite to its starting position , while the remaining structure assumes the si - c@xmath16 configuration . at 14.5  ev </S>",
    "<S> , the ejected c is left as an adatom directly to the side of the si , but at 14.75  ev , it bounces off the si atom on its downward trajectory and lands as an adatom on the opposite side . for energies below 14.5  ev , </S>",
    "<S> no change in the structure is obtained .    because si - c@xmath12 is energetically favoured over si - c@xmath16 ( by ca . </S>",
    "<S> 1.02  ev  @xcite ) , it is likely that all configurations where the c adatom remains very close will relax back into the si - c@xmath12 configuration ( whether this results in an apparent jump event likely depends on whether c landed on the opposite side ) . </S>",
    "<S> we thus take 14.625  ev to be the lower threshold for this process , corresponding to a cross section of 0.494  barn . to estimate the cross section for moving the si dopant </S>",
    "<S> , we subtract the cross section corresponding to @xmath13 ( as the largest cross section is a sum of the cross sections of all possible outcomes ) , i.e. , @xmath17  barn . </S>",
    "<S> if we instead assume no recombination of c adatoms with the si - c@xmath16 site , the cross section estimate is reduced to 0.316 barn . </S>",
    "<S> ( these would be 0.130 and 0.084  barn for @xmath10c , respectively . ) </S>",
    "<S> all of the reported results correspond to displacements in a direction perpendicular to the graphene plane , and the curved trajectory is a result of the silicon - carbon interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> to double - check the calculated value , we carried out a few computationally demanding simulations using the default gpaw finite differences ( fd ) mode . </S>",
    "<S> the fd calculations gave a slightly lower knock - on threshold of 16.625 ev ( 0.032 barn ) , but also a lower flip threshold of 14.375 ev ( 0.666 barn ) ; the jump cross section would thus be @xmath18  barn  @xcite .    ]    in our experimental data , we found 38 cases where a clear si jump was observed , with one continuous time series containing 19 consecutive jumps of the same si atom ( figure  [ figstat ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the event doses ( ie . , the irradiation doses between structural rearrangements ) determined for the centre of the scan area ranged from 0.24 to 20.01@xmath19  e@xmath7/@xmath8 . however , as the scan frame was centred on the si atom , the doses on the neighbouring carbon atoms varied from scan to scan , which was taken into account via a monte carlo integration . if we assume that the data are stochastic , the waiting times ( or , equivalently , the doses ) should be poisson - distributed . </S>",
    "<S> thus the expected value of a poisson distribution fitted to the data can be used to estimate a cross section for the process ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for details ) .    </S>",
