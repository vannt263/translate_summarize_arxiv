    "subsequent observations by russell et al .",
    "( 2010 ) after v496 sct came out of the solar conjunction showed dust formation on 2010 february 10 .",
    "the ir and optical observations for nova v496 sct are taken from mt .",
    "abu ir observatory of prl in india , at asiago observatory of university of padova and inaf astronomical observatory of padova and schiaparelli observatory in italy , respectively .     on both the days while the temperature of the gas t@xmath7 is 4000 k and 3600 k respectively .",

    ", width=384,height=192 ]",
    "from the optical light curve we estimate @xmath8 to be 59 @xmath2 5 d ( raj et al . 2012 ) which makes v496 sct as one of the moderately fast fe ii class of novae in recent years .",
    "v496 sct is one of the large amplitude novae observed in recent years with @xmath9 @xmath10 13.5 magnitudes ( guido & sostero 2009 ) .",
    "these observed values of the amplitude and @xmath8 for v496 sct put it above the upper limit in the observed spread of the amplitude versus decline rate plot for classical novae presented by warner ( 2008 , figure 2.3 ) which shows @xmath11 = 8 - 11 for @xmath12 = 59 days .",
    "the height from the galactic plane is estimated to be @xmath13 = 89 @xmath2 3 pc by using the value of the ditance @xmath14 = 2.9 @xmath2 0.3 kpc ( raj et al .",

    "a small plateau is also seen in the light curve between 128 and 215 days after the outburst .",
    "the best fit model spectra to the observed data are obtained by varying the input parameters m@xmath7 , @xmath4 , t@xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "the increase in m@xmath7 enhances the absolute level of the co emission while the increase in t@xmath7 changes the relative intensities of different vibrational bands in addition to changing the absolute level of the emission .",
    "the co emission is assumed to be optically thin .",
    "the c i lines at 2.2906 and 2.3130 @xmath21 m and na i lines at 2.3348 and 2.3379 @xmath21 m are also likely to be present in the spectral region covered by the co emission giving rise to some deviations between the best model fit and the observed spectra .",
    "the typical errors to the formal model fits are @xmath2 500 k. the model spectra with a reasonably similar range in mass of m@xmath7 = 1.5@xmath222 @xmath17 10@xmath23 m@xmath19 fit the observed spectra .",
    "the model calculations also show that the @xmath24 = 2 - 0 bandhead of @xmath25co at 2.3130 @xmath21 m becomes discernibly prominent if the @xmath26c/@xmath25c ratio is @xmath271.5 . as this spectral feature",
    "is not clearly detected in our observed spectra , we place a lower limit of 1.5 for the @xmath26c/@xmath25c ratio .",
    "the various phases of the spectral evolution of v496 sct have been identified using the tololo classification system for novae ( williams et al .",
    "( 1991 ) ; williams et al .",
    "( 1994 ) ) .",
    "the permitted lines of fe ii were the strongest non - balmer lines in the pre - maximum as well as the early decline phase indicating p@xmath28 class for the nova .",
    "the nova had evolved to the auroral phase a@xmath29 in 2010 march as the [ n ii ] 5755 auroral line was the strongest non - balmer line .",
    "we note the absence of [ fe x ] 6375 coronal emission line in the spectra taken as late as 2011 april 19 ( see fig .",
    "thus the optical spectra show that the nova evolved in the p@xmath28a@xmath29 spectral sequence .",
    "we have also tried to estimate the ejecta mass by using recombination line analysis of h i lines for 2009 december 6 ( fig .",
    "3 ) . however , we find that the strengths of these lines , relative to each other , deviate considerably ( specially for br@xmath33 , fig .",
    "3 ) from case b values for 2009 december 6 indicating that the lines are optically thick .",
    "hence we are unable to estimate the ejecta mass from recombination analysis . from the optical spectra , we estimated the mass of oxygen m@xmath34 in the range 1.18@xmath1710@xmath35 - 2.28@xmath1710@xmath36 m@xmath19 .",

    "we obtain m@xmath37 = 1 - 5@xmath1710@xmath38m@xmath19 for 2010 april 30 from the best fit value t@xmath37 @xmath39 1500 @xmath2 200 k ( with @xmath40@xmath41 minimization ) for @xmath14 = 2.9 kpc . hence the gas to dust ratio",
    "is found to be m@xmath42/m@xmath37 @xmath16 1.3 - 6.3 @xmath1710@xmath43 indicating that a small amount of dust was formed in v496 sct comparable to 3 @xmath1710@xmath43 observed in the case of v2362 cyg by munari et al .",
