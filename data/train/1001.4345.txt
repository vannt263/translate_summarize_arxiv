    "a very elegant theory linking attenuation and dispersion is presented for viscoelastic media with positive relaxation spectrum .",
    "all the attenuation and dispersion functions compatible with the theory are represented by simple integral representations . the attenuation function and the dispersion function are both expressed as transforms of a positive measure ( the dispersion - attenuation measure ) .",
    "the measure is arbitrary except for a very mild growth condition .",
    "these expressions can be considered as a dispersion relation in parametric form .",
    "in contrast the acoustic kramers - kronig dispersion @xcite relations are non - local .",
    "they express the dispersion function in terms of the attenuation function or conversely .",
    "this presupposes that one of these functions ( usually the dispersion function ) is very accurately known and consistent with the basic assumptions of the theory . on the other hand , substituting any positive measure in the parametric dispersion relation yields an admissible ( compatible with the theory ) dispersion and attenuation .",
    "the origin of the kramers - kronig dispersion relations is unclear . in electromagnetic theory",
    "they follow from the causality of the time - domain kernel representing the dielectric constant in the dispersive case . in acoustics they follow from an ad hoc assumption about the analytic properties of the wave number .",
    "it is namely assumed that the wave number is the fourier transform of a causal function or distribution .",
    "the physical meaning of the causal function or distribution is unclear hence the justification of the acoustic kramers - kronig dispersion relation is missing .",
    "various inequalities imposed on the complex continuation of the wave number can not be expressed in terms of a constitutive assumption .",
    "hence the acoustic kramers - kronig dispersion relation are an ad hoc addition to the constitutive equation , often incompatible with it .    it will be also shown that in media with non - negative relaxation spectrum the frequency dependence of the attenuation function in the high frequency range is sublinear . in the case of power law attenuation the attenuation and dispersion are proportional to a power of frequency @xmath0 . numerous experiments in acoustics indicate that the power - attenuation law accurately represents the frequency dependence of dispersion and attenuation over several decades of frequency .",
    "the theory based on positive relaxation spectrum implies that @xmath1 .",
    "this seems to contradict the experimental ultrasound investigations of numerous materials which point to higher values of the exponent in the power law attenuation .",
    "for example in ultrasound investigations of soft tissues the exponent varies between 1 and 1.5 , while in some viscoelastic fluids such as castor oil it lies between 1.5 and 2 .",
    "we shall refer to this case as superlinear frequency dependence .",
    "typical values of the power - law exponent in medical applications using ultrasound transducers are @xmath2 in bovine liver for 1100  mhz , @xmath3 in human myocardium and other bio - tissues @xcite . @xmath4 in castor oil at ca 250  mhz .",
    "values in the range 12 are observed at lower frequencies in aromatic polyurethanes @xcite .",
    "nearly linear frequency dependence of attenuation is well documented in seismology @xcite .",
    "approximately linear frequency dependence of attenuation has been observed in geological materials in the range 140  hz to 2.2  mhz .",
    "several papers have been devoted to a theoretical underpinning of the superlinear dispersion - attenuation models @xcite . in order to resolve some problems chen and",
    "holm @xcite suggested to add a fractional laplacian of order @xmath5 of the velocity field to the usual laplacian of the displacement field in the equations of motion .",
    "their paper still leads to an unbounded sound speed for @xmath6 and adds a new problem : the equation of motion does not have the form of a viscoelastic equation of motion .",
    "sublinear power law attenuation ( @xmath7 ) has also been reported in experimental investigations @xcite .",
    "non - power law attenuation laws are usually derived from the constitutive laws .",
    "investigations of creep and relaxation in viscoelastic materials always support the assumption of positive relaxation spectrum ( e.g. @xcite for creep in metals , @xcite for the upper mantle with @xmath8 ) and therefore models derived from constitutive relations exhibit sublinear attenuation and dispersion at high frequencies . in particular this",
    "applies to the cole - cole , havriliak - negami and cole - davidson and kohlrausch - williams - watts relaxation laws commonly applied in phenomenological rock mechanics , polymer rheology @xcite , bio - tissue mechanics ( e.g. for bone collagen @xcite ) as well as for ionic glasses @xcite .",
    "another abnormal feature of wave propagation in media with superlinear power laws ( and more generally in media with superlinear asymptotic frequency dependence ) is appearance of precursors .",
    "the precursors extend to infinity and thus the speed of propagation of disturbances is infinite .",
    "finite speed of wave propagation requires that in the high - frequency range the exponent of the power law does not exceed 1 .",
    "it is a very challenging problem how to explain the incompatibility between the theory and experiment in the superlinear case .",
    "it seems likely that the attenuation observed at ultrasound frequencies significantly differs from the asymptotic behavior of attenuation at the frequency tending to infinity .",
    "one might surmise that the frequency range of ultrasound measurements is still far below the asymptotic high frequency range in which different mechanisms are at play .",
    "this suggests studying models of attenuation with a slowly varying power - law exponent .",
    "in viscoelasticity the relaxation modulus @xmath9 , defined by the constitutive stress - strain relation @xmath10 is assumed to have positive relaxation spectral density @xmath11 .",
