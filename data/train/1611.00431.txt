    "<S> threshold solutions are shown to demonstrate time - scaling laws , and the space separating true and false vacuum end states is shown to be fractal in nature , similar to oscillons . </S>",
    "<S> coherent states with superextremal charge - to - mass ratios are shown to exist and observed to collapse or expand , depending on the sign of the charge perturbation . expanding superextremal bubbles induce a phase transition to the true ads vacuum , while collapsing superextremal bubbles can form nonsingular strongly gravitating solutions with superextremal rn exteriors . </S>"
