    "accordingly , every null geodesic orthogonal to @xmath3 is a coordinate curve .",
    "nncs were introduced in @xcite in the context of black hole horizons , where @xmath3 was chosen to be a cross section of the horizon . however , from the definition above it is clear that nncs may be constructed off any codimension two spatial surface in an arbitrary spacetime , as long as the surface can be covered with a single coordinate chart and the orthogonal geodesics do not intersect .",
    "note also that the orthogonal null geodesics generate a pair of null hypersurfaces , each cut in half by the surface .",

    "furthermore , the null surfaces to the past of @xmath3 form part of the boundary of its past . therefore , if @xmath3 is very small , the null surfaces are part of a local causal horizon .",

    "it will also be shown that the coordinates we introduce are , in some sense , the simplest possible to have the properties of being null normal and locally inertial .",

    "the prescription given in the appendix uniquely retrieves the vector fields constructed in section [ linncs ] .",

    "the components of these vector fields in locally inertial coordinates are such that boosts would be generated if the coordinates were globally inertial .",
    "then the killing equation is satisfied in the neighbourhood of a spacetime point , up to possible corrections linear in the locally inertial coordinates .",

    "this additional specification also has the consequence that the killing equation in a neighbourhood of a spacetime point holds up to corrections _",

    "no killing vectors are guaranteed to exist , but @xmath4 is still a fixed point of @xmath58 at which the killing equation is satisfied , and furthermore @xmath61 .    we will impose a restriction on @xmath58 that determines many of the higher order terms in its expansion . for a true killing vector , combining different permutations of the covariant derivative of the killing equation",

    "this is an equation valid in any coordinate system and it is the only equation in this paper where riemann components and christoffel symbols take values in a spacetime neighbourhood , not just at @xmath4 .",

    "lastly , let @xmath34 be the null geodesic through @xmath4 with tangent @xmath11",
    ". we will evaluate the nnc components of the killing identity term ( [ lhscomp ] ) on @xmath34 , using the approximate killing vector ( [ local_killing_nnc ] ) . since @xmath34 is simply a coordinate curve , with points on @xmath34 having nncs @xmath64 ,",
    "the nnc components of ( [ lhscomp ] ) on @xmath34 reduce to a power series in @xmath65 . making use of the fact that at @xmath4 the coordinate system is locally inertial , we find [ powers of v ] .",
    "( _ _ _ - r^ _ _ ) _ = c _ + ( d_v + - - - _ _ v - r_v ) v + . as in the rest of the text ( with the exception of ( [ lhscomp ] ) )",
    "the riemann components and christoffel symbols on the rhs of ( [ powers of v ] ) are evaluated at @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , we defined @xmath66 and for brevity we introduced the notation 2 _ v ^[v_^u]_. now we are ready to impose that the killing identity hold on @xmath34 , which amounts to putting the rhs of ( [ powers of v ] ) to zero , order by order . at zeroth order",
    "this requires c _ = 0 , and as a consequence the quadratic term in @xmath58 vanishes , i.e. @xmath67 .",
    "a further consequence is that the killing equation is satisfied in a neighbourhood of @xmath4 up to terms quadratic in the coordinates , @xmath68 . given the linear terms in @xmath58 , this is as good as it gets : no choice of third order terms can reduce the order of the killing equation further .    at first order , imposing the killing identity on @xmath34 requires [ third order coeffs ] d_v = - + + + _ _ v + r_v .",
    "note that this does not fully determine the third order terms in @xmath69 , but only those that are at least linear in @xmath65 . to write the @xmath70-coefficients more explicitly",
    ", we note that at the origin of any locally inertial coordinate system ( and for the nncs ( [ nnc ] ) in particular ) it holds that [ licresult ] _ _ = - _ _ g _ + _ _ ( g _ ) . in addition",
    ", we may express riemann components at the origin of a locally inertial coordinate system in terms of second derivatives of the metric .",
    "substituting these expressions into ( [ third order coeffs ] ) results in [ result ] d_v = - + + + _ _ g_v + _ _ v g _ - _ v _ ( g _ ) , with the brackets given by [ brac ] = ( - _ v_v g _ + _ v _",
    "( g_)v ) ^v _ + ( _ v_u g _ - _ v _ ( g_)u ) ^u_. clearly , the bracket @xmath71 is symmetric in the index pair @xmath72 .",
    "it is then manifest that the rhs of ( [ result ] ) is also symmetric in @xmath72 , as is necessary for consistency with the symmetry of @xmath73 .",
    "we remind the reader that the second derivatives of the metric are to be evaluated at @xmath4 .",
    "these derivatives can be read off directly from the metric components listed in ( [ metrici])-([metricf ] ) and they are always proportional to a component of the riemann tensor .",
    "accordingly , all the coefficients @xmath73 are required to be a certain ( sum of ) riemann component(s ) evaluated at @xmath4 .    similarly ,",
    "at second order the killing identity on @xmath34 requires the coefficients @xmath74 to be given in terms of partial derivatives of the riemann components . at the next order , coefficients @xmath75",
    "are required to be a sum of second derivatives of riemann components and products of riemann components , and so on .",
    "hence we see that the killing identity may be satisfied exactly on the null geodesic @xmath34 through @xmath4 .",
    "this also has the consequence that @xmath58 satisfies the killing equation exactly on @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , as shown in @xcite , @xmath58 is null on @xmath34 and has the same proportionality to an affine tangent as has a killing vector generating a killing horizon , namely @xmath76 .",
    "the author would like to thank ted jacobson and sudipta sarkar for valuable discussions .",
    "as is well known , the inner product of a pair of vectors is preserved under parallel transport along a curve .",
    "if the curve is not null , any vector field defined along the curve may be uniquely decomposed into a part tangential to the curve and a part orthogonal to it .",
    "since an affine tangent to a geodesic is parallel transported into itself , this implies that along a non - null geodesic the tangential and orthogonal parts of a parallel transported vector are parallel transported separately .",
    "fermi - walker ( fw ) transport @xcite generalises the notion of parallel transport such that the above features survive along non - geodesic curves .",
    "that is , fw transport reduces to parallel transport along a geodesic , the inner product of a pair of fw transported vectors is preserved and the tangential and orthogonal parts of a vector that is fw transported along a non - null curve are fw transported separately .",
    "the present aim is to define a notion of transport across a multidimensional surface that again shares these features with fw transport .",
    "this will be achieved by generating the surface by a family of curves that emanate from a point and by specifying how a vector is transported along each curve . before proceeding",
    ", it will be instructive to give a definition of fw transport along non - null curves , as this will allow for a natural extension to the multidimensional case .",
    "let @xmath82 be the projector onto a non - null curve and @xmath83 the projector onto its orthogonal complement .",
    "a vector @xmath84 defined along the curve may be decomposed as w= tw + nw . if @xmath84 and @xmath85 are vectors which are fw transported along the curve , their tangential and orthogonal parts should be fw transported separately .",
    "therefore , the inner products of their tangential parts and of their orthogonal parts should both be preserved separately . for the tangential parts this reads [ fwtang ] 0 & = & ^ + & = & _ a ( tx)^a + ( tw)_a ^a , where covariant differentiation along the curve was denoted by a dot . allowing for arbitrary vectors at an initial point on the curve , this condition can only be satisfied provided that the covariant derivatives of the tangential parts are orthogonal vectors .",
    "therefore , we impose [ cond1 ] ( tw)^ = n ( tw)^ , and similarly for @xmath85 .",
    "the latter condition is satisfied if and only if the norm of @xmath86 remains constant .",
    "another statement equivalent to ( [ cond1 ] ) is that @xmath86 is parallel transported along the curve , according to the derivative operator compatible with the one dimensional metric induced on the curve .",
    "similar to the condition imposed on a tangential part @xmath86 , we ensure that the inner product of orthogonal parts @xmath87 and @xmath88 is preserved under fw transport , by imposing that the covariant derivative of an orthogonal part @xmath87 is tangential .",
    "this may be written as [ cond2 ] ( nw)^ = t ( nw)^ . the condition ( [ cond1 ] ) together with the @xmath89 conditions ( [ cond2 ] ) can be summarized by a single differential vector equation .",
    "for this purpose , we parametrize the curve such that the tangent @xmath90 has a constant norm , given by @xmath91",
    ". a standard choice would be to parametrize by proper length or time , for which we have @xmath92 .",
    "in abstract index notation , the covariant derivative along the curve is defined by @xmath93 and the tangential projector is given by @xmath94 .",
    "thus the tangential part of @xmath84 is written as @xmath95 . using these expressions and substituting ( [ cond1 ] ) into ( [ cond2 ] )",
    ", we find that a vector can be defined to be fw transported if it is a solution to the equation [ fw ] = e^-1 .",
    "we will now define a vector field on an @xmath96-dimensional ( non - null ) surface @xmath3 , starting from a vector at a given point on the surface , and in such a way that the definition reduces to fw transport for the case @xmath97 .",
    "an @xmath96-dimensional projector @xmath82 and an @xmath98-dimensional projector @xmath99 are introduced , projecting onto the surface and its orthogonal complement respectively .",
    "the metric @xmath100 induced on the surface is obtained from the projection operator @xmath101 by lowering one index by the full spacetime metric .",
    "furthermore , the surface is regarded as generated by a family of curves that emanate from a given base - point @xmath4 . on a sufficiently small surface , every point ( other than @xmath4 ) will lie on a unique curve in this family .",
    "we then focus on one particular curve , again denoting covariant differentiation along the curve by a dot .    starting with a vector @xmath102 at @xmath4 , the transport of @xmath102 along the curve",
    "is defined by the @xmath96 conditions [ mcond1 ] ( tw)^ = n ( tw)^ , together with the @xmath98 conditions [ mcond2 ] ( nw)^ = t ( nw)^ , in close analogy to the conditions ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) for fw transport .",
    "that is to say , @xmath84 is defined along the curve by requiring the covariant derivative of its tangential part to be orthogonal and the covariant derivative of its orthogonal part to be tangential .",
    "condition ( [ cond1 ] ) may again be interpreted as stating that the tangential part of @xmath84 is parallel transported along the curve , only now according to the derivative operator compatible with the induced metric @xmath100 on the surface . by construction ,",
    "inner products of transported vectors are preserved and tangential and orthogonal parts of a transported vector are transported separately . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath102 is orthogonal to @xmath3 then the transport of @xmath102 will be orthogonal to @xmath3 everywhere and will have a fixed norm and comparing with the components of the orthogonal projection of the parallel transport . ] .    repeating this for all curves through @xmath4 in the family that was chosen to generate @xmath3 then obtains a vector field @xmath103 on @xmath3 .",
    "clearly , the definition of the transported vector field depends on the family of curves that generate @xmath3 . for definiteness",
    ", we choose the family of surface geodesics through @xmath4 associated to the induced metric @xmath100 .",
    "since a different choice of base - point on @xmath3 leads to a different family of surface geodesics , our definition of surface transport is subject to the choice of base - point @xmath4 .",
    "as in the case of fw transport , the defining conditions ( [ mcond1 ] ) and ( [ mcond2 ] ) may be combined into a single equation . to this end",
    ", we introduce a tangential basis @xmath104 at @xmath4 and construct tangential basis vectors @xmath105 everywhere on @xmath3 as the solutions to ( [ mcond1 ] ) with initial condition @xmath106 . in other words , @xmath105 is the parallel transport of @xmath106 along the surface geodesics , according to the derivative operator compatible with the induced metric on the surface . as such , @xmath107 is orthogonal to @xmath3 and the inner products @xmath108 are constant along @xmath3 .",
    "an orthonormal frame at @xmath4 would provide a natural initial condition to give rise to such a tangential basis .",
    "next , writing @xmath109 , we note that the tangential components can be expressed as @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the inverse of the matrix @xmath112 . upon substitution of ( [ mcond1 ] ) into ( [ mcond2 ] ) ,",
    "a straightforward manipulation then obtains [ transport ] = t^ab . for the case",
    "@xmath97 , this equation manifestly reduces to the defining equation ( [ fw ] ) of fw transport .",
    "furthermore , ( [ transport ] ) implies the @xmath7 conditions ( [ mcond1 ] ) and ( [ mcond2 ] ) and uniquely determines a vector @xmath103 along @xmath3 , once @xmath102 is specified .",
    "in particular , it may be checked that the vector fields @xmath113 and @xmath114 defined in ( [ kl ] ) are the unique solutions to ( [ transport ] ) for the given initial vectors @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",

    "<S> they are convenient in the study of local causal horizons . as an application , </S>",
    "<S> the coordinate system is used to specify a vector field that satisfies the killing equation approximately in a small region and the killing identity exactly on a single null geodesic . </S>",
    "<S> we also construct a vector field on a surface , starting from a vector at a given point on the surface . </S>",
    "<S> this construction may be regarded as a generalisation of the notion of fermi - walker transport . </S>"
