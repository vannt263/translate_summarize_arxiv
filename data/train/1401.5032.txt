    "the quality and quantity of satellite data is revealing subtle features in cepheid pulsation .",
    "specifically , we discuss here recent findings from two long series of observations by the _ kepler _ and _ most _ satellites .",
    "there is only one classical cepheid ( v1154 cyg ) in the _ kepler _ field , and it is a fundamental mode pulsator with a period of 4.9@xmath0 .",
    "analysis of the _ kepler _ data by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* derekas et al . ( 2012 ) ) found small cycle to cycle variations of the period .",
    "typically the period excursions might be 20 minutes and last up to 15 cycles before the sign of the period change ( @xmath3 ) reverses .",
    "to look further for the small fluctuations made visible by the long continuous strings of accurate satellite data , we observed two cepheids with the _ most _ satellite ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* walker et al .",
    "2003 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* matthews et al .  2004 ) ) .",
    "motivation for the structure of the observation request is provided by known period changes in cepheids ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the data taken from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* szabados ( 1983 ) ) show the well known increase in period fluctuations with period or luminosity of the cepheid .",
    "this is consistent with period changes ( @xmath3 ) determined by evolution through the instability strip , with more luminous stars evolving more quickly .",
    "the exception to the trend , however , is the group of cepheids pulsating in an overtone mode which apparently show unusually large period jitter rather than the smooth and continuous evolution of fundamental mode pulsators .    for the _ most _ observations we wanted to contrast the behavior of a fundamental mode pulsator ( rt aur ) with a first overtone pulsator ( sz tau ) . the background information on @xmath3 is shown in fig .  [ fig2 ]",
    ". for rt aur the period change o@xmath4c ( observed minus computed )",
    "diagram has a decrease followed by an increase , which is typically fitted with a parabola . for sz tau",
    ", the o@xmath4c diagram shows both increasing and decreasing periods , as well as about 10000 days when it remains constant .    the _ most _ observations ( evans et al .",
    ", in preparation ) phased for pulsation period are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . for rt aur",
    ", the observations were interleaved with another target , resulting in gaps in the light curve . however , the light curve repeats very precisely from cycle to cycle . for sz tau , the overtone pulsator ,",
    "only the maximum of the phased light curve is shown .",
    "this emphasizes the fact that there are variations in maximum brightness from cycle to cycle ( also easily visible at minimum light ) .",
    "a small instrumental signal ( differing earthshine through the satellite orbit ) is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , which is being removed through additional processing .",
    "the data from the two stars was subjected to a number of comparisons . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the fourier spectra are shown after pre - whitening for a fourier fit of 10 terms .",
    "the instrumental signal is seen at the orbital frequency ( @xmath114 d@xmath5 ) .",
    "the fourier series describes the fundamental mode pulsator ( rt aur ) well and little power is left at low frequencies . in sz tau ,",
    "on the other hand , power still remains in a complicated set of low frequencies , indicating that the single periodicity does not fully describe the pulsation .",
    "the fourier parameters themselves were compared for the two stars . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the amplitude ratio @xmath6 changes for the six cycles observed for each of the stars . for rt aur",
    ", the variation is estimated to be 3% . for sz",
    "tau the variation is much larger ( 45% ) .",
    "the variation in fig .",
    "5 ( right ) is typical of the variation in other fourier coefficients of the overtone cepheid .",
    "thus the _ most _ observations show that the overtone pulsator sz tau has a larger variability in the parameters we examined , or a larger instability in the pulsation than the fundamental mode cepheid .",
    "we present here a brief summary of the period changes or possible period changes in classical cepheids and the characteristics of pulsation which they suggest .",
    "most probably the @xmath3 which we observe results from a combination of causes .              *",
    "flickering @xmath3 ( _ kepler _ ) : it is cyclic and reasonably short term",
    ". it could be due either to a pulsation phenomenon or star spots .",
    "* instability in overtones ( _ most _ ) : this seems to be most probably pulsation related .",
