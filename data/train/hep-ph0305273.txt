    "the rg evolution has interesting phenomenological implications . in the case of leptogenesis , we have estimated the corrections which arise if the running is appropriately taken into account and found that the mass window for baryogenesis is likely to shrink when those corrections are considered . in order to simplify the inclusion of rg effects in future calculations , we provide the relevant information of the mass parameters at the leptogenesis scale .",

    "in particular , if the modulus of one of the @xmath279 is very small , it turns out to be more accurate to choose a combination in which this specific @xmath279 does not appear .",
    "since the effective neutrino mass matrix is symmetric , it can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix @xmath280 , @xmath281 the form of @xmath183 depends on a prescription how to order the mass eigenvalues .",

    "now we can solve for the derivatives of the mixing parameters .",
    "note that due to the separation of the evolution of the mass eigenvalues in equation , we have reduced the number of parameters from 12 to 9 .",
    "the discussion so far has been very similar to the one of @xcite .",
    "there , the rg evolution of the mixing parameters is expressed in terms of the mixing matrix elements and @xmath313 .    in order to obtain rather short and more explicit formulae , which are e.g.  useful for deriving the approximations of sec .",
