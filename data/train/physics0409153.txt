    "spillover is an effect accompanying heterogeneous surface reactions when inactive surface regions significantly influence the kinetics of the overall catalytic process .",
    "it is caused by the fact that those parts of the surface which are inactive in the surface reaction can be active for other processes occurring during the catalytic process , i.e. adsorption - desorption processes , and increase or decrease concentrations of either substrate or product particles on active parts of the surface through the surface diffusion .",
    "the spillover effect is observed and plays a significant role in catalytic reactions on supported metal catalysts @xcite .",
    "the description of process dynamics in systems with spillover is complicated for several reasons .",
    "firstly  surface heterogeneity . in most cases",
    "the heterogeneity , because of the occurrence of local effects , makes it impossible to use methods based on global chemical kinetics . secondly ",
    "surface heterogeneity means not only differences in energetic properties of different surface regions but also involves geometrical heterogeneities .",
    "there are active centers with different energetic properties on the surface but additionally those centers are often arranged in different ways ( for example active centers can form various clusters placed on the surface in various ways or active centers can be spread randomly all over the surface ) .",
    "the chemical and physical properties of the surface depend also on the arrangement of active centers .",
    "thirdly  sizes of surface structures and length scales characteristic for spillover processes are tenths or hundredths of nanometers .",
    "thus it is very complicated to use quantum chemical or molecular dynamics calculations to investigate such large systems and processes occurring in such long time scales . to investigate surface processes particularly in case of inhomogeneous surfaces and non - equilibrium conditions one can use monte carlo methods @xcite ( kinetic monte carlo or dynamic monte carlo ) .",
    "such simulation methods make it possible to investigate systems much larger then in the case of quantum chemical calculations and analyze processes with characteristic times much longer than in molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "these methods also let to include the influence of local effects occuring on the surface .",
    "the current state of theoretical research of reactions with spillover effects includes both computer simulations and attempts at the analytical description of such processes kinetics . in one of the most recent theoretical publications in this subject zhdanov and kasemo @xcite derived analytical formulas to describe dynamics of a model reaction with spillover effect  oxidation of co on a supported metal catalyst ( for example pd / al@xmath3o@xmath4 ) .",
    "oxidation reactions of this type are good examples of processes with spillover from a practical point of view ",
    "it is relatively simple to investigate them experimentally and they are important as actual catalytic processes .",
    "however , an analytical description of considered process requires many assumptions .",
    "libuda , hoffmann et al .",
    "@xcite presented experimental results and computer simulations of kinetics of co oxidation on pd / al@xmath3o@xmath4 but in those papers only mean - field simulation methods have been used and because of that methodology spatial heterogeneities have been neglected .",
    "recently , kovaliov @xcite et al .",
    "investigated @xmath5 reaction with spillover using monte carlo simulations . in their work",
    "a adsorption was assumed as irreversible and they studied the influence of metal particle s morphology on the dynamics of the process .",
    "our results are comparable with the ones obtained in their paper but in our work the metal particle s morphology is neglected because we wanted to focus on the spillover and to investigate its influence on the catalytic process .    in this",
    "paper non - equilibrium dynamic monte carlo simulations were used to investigate the co oxidation reaction with the spillover effect on a supported metal catalyst .",
    "this allowed us to analyze the heterogeneous process kinetics for a wide range of its parameters and to include spatial heterogeneities . using our simulation techniques new types of behavior occurring in this system",
    "have been found .",
    "in this paper we considered the dynamics of the catalytic process that can be presented by the following set of chemical equations : @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 where : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13  substrate a particles in the gas phase , adsorbed on the active metal particle and adsorbed on the inactive support respectively ; @xmath14 , @xmath15  adsorption sites respectively on the active metal particle and on the support ; @xmath16  two neighboring adsorption sites on the metal particle ; @xmath17  substrate b particle in the gas phase ; @xmath18  b particle adsorbed on the metal particle after the dissociative adsorption of @xmath2 particle ; @xmath19  surface reaction product particle desorbed to the gas phase .",
    "the catalytic process takes place on the surface of the supported metal catalyst .",
    "this surface consists of two different regions : the support inactive in the surface reaction ( for example , corresponding to al@xmath3o@xmath4 ) and the active particles ( for example , corresponding to nanometer pd crystallites )  the only parts of the surface where the surface reaction given by eq .",
    "[ eq : react ] takes place .",
    "it was assumed that an a particle can adsorb , desorb and diffuse all over the surface .",
    "b@xmath3 particles can adsorb exclusively on the active region where they dissociate and the product of the dissociation ( b particles ) stays on the active region .",
    "b particles can neither desorb nor diffuse to the inactive support .",
    "as mentioned above , this model can describe , for example , a co oxidation reaction on a supported metal catalyst pd / al@xmath3o@xmath4 @xcite .    if we neglect adsorption and diffusion ( eq . [ eq : a_inact_ads ] . and [ eq : a_diff ] . )",
    "we would get a well known zgb model of co oxidation reaction on a single facet of metal catalyst @xcite .",
    "three additional differences between these two models exist . in our case",
    "a adsorption is reversible , diffusion of a particles on the metal particle is present and the surface reaction is not immediate . in the zgb model",
    "a adsorption was an irreversible process , surface diffusion was forbidden and the reaction occurred immediate after adsorption of a particle on the site adjacent to an adsorbed b particle .",
    "we will compare our results obtained for the system without support ( i.e. without spillover ) with the zgb model in sec .",
    "[ subsec : react_on_particle ] .",
    "analytical expressions describing the dynamics of the process in question can be derived assuming high surface reaction rates and high dominance of one substrate in the gas phase @xcite .",
    "the latter assumption means that the value of the partial pressure of a substrate in the gas phase ( @xmath20 ) is near 0 or 1 ( partial pressures of substrates obey @xmath21 ) . from analytical results",
    "one can conclude the process achieves a maximum rate in the medium range of pressures for various sets of system parameters .",
    "the maximum rate region is the most important from a practical point of view .",
    "however , analytical expressions derived for extreme values of reactants partial pressures do not allow exact description of the medium pressures range .",
    "our dynamic monte carlo simulations allowed us to analyze the system behavior in the whole range of pressure values .    in this paper the case of well - separated active particles",
    "was considered , i.e. diffusion spheres of active particles did not overlap .",
    "the investigation of process dynamics in such system can be reduced to simulations of the system consisting of one active particle placed on a relatively large support region . in our simulations",
    "the catalyst surface was represented by a two - dimensional square lattice with 150@xmath22150 nodes . in the middle of the lattice",
    "a smaller square consisting of 50@xmath2250 nodes was distinguished and this square corresponded to the metal particle active in the surface reaction .",
    "the rest of the lattice nodes were assumed to be a support inactive in the surface reaction .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were used to exclude the influence of the edges of simulation lattice .    in simulations",
    "it was assumed that above the surface there is a mixture of gaseous substrates a and b@xmath3 with known partial pressures of both compounds @xmath20 and @xmath23 . according to the reaction mechanism we assumed that particles of substrate a can adsorb with given probabilities on active and inactive lattice sites ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively ) . particles a also can desorb from each site with probabilities @xmath26 or @xmath27 because , according to eq .",
    "[ eq : a_act_ads ] and [ eq : a_inact_ads ] , adsorption of substrate a is reversible . to mimic surface diffusion ,",
    "adsorbed a particles could move on the lattice .",
    "this was done through jumps of a particle between neighboring lattice sites with given probabilities .",
    "the four nearest adjacent sites to the considered one were regarded as neighboring ( von neumann neighborhood ) .",
    "the presence of two types of lattice sites ( active  _ act _ and inactive  _ inact _ ) allowed for four different types of jumps which could be characterized by different values of jump probabilities ( from active to active site , active to inactive , inactive to inactive and inactive to active ) .",
    "it was assumed that b@xmath3 particles can adsorb only on active lattice sites and that adsorption is dissociative .",
    "such an adsorption mechanism allows the adsorption of b@xmath3 particles to take place only on those unoccupied active lattice sites with at least one unoccupied neighboring site ",
    "b@xmath3 adsorption requires the presence of two unoccupied neighboring active lattice sites .",
    "furthermore it was assumed that , due to the dissociation , b@xmath3 adsorption is irreversible because in the presented model the probability of b@xmath3 desorption is smaller than the probabilities of other processes ( b@xmath3 desorption requires , in addition to crossing the surface bonding barrier , additionally the meeting of two adjacent adsorbed b particles and also the crossing of an association process energy barrier ) .",
    "adsorbed b particles occupied only active sites because they could not diffuse from the active region to the support . in the presented model only a particles could diffuse from the support to the active region and vice versa  this diffusion is _",
    "the spillover_. in simulations , the diffusion of b particles adsorbed on the active region was neglected because b particles can not cross the active  inactive region border and just that process ( i.e. spillover ) governs the overall catalytic process dynamics .",
    "diffusion processes within the active region do not directly influence this dynamics .",
    "if two adjacent active sites were occupied by a and b particles , irreversible surface reaction ( eq . [ eq : react ] ) could take place , an ab particle was formed and it was immediately removed from the lattice ( corresponding to the immediate desorption of the product to the gas phase ) .",
    "the presence of neighboring a and b particles on the active region could be caused either by direct adsorption of a and b particles on active sites or by surface diffusion of a particles from inactive to active sites .",
    "therefore a particles could be transported to active regions by two different mechanisms : by direct adsorption ( adsorption channel ) and by surface diffusion from the inactive region ( spillover channel ) .",
    "at the beginning of each simulation , values of partial pressures of a and b@xmath3 substrates and values of processes probabilities were assumed .",
    "each simulation consisted of repeated identical steps .",
    "each step started with the random choice of one site on the simulation lattice .    *",

    "* * in the case of the desorption an attempt of removing the particle out of the lattice with the probability @xmath26 or @xmath27 ( depending on the kind of the lattice site ) was made . after this attempt and independently of its results , the simulation step ended . * * in the case of reaction , the type of the current site was checked . if the current site was inactive one  the simulation step ended . if the current site was active",
    " one of the four neighboring sites was randomly chosen .",
    "if the neighboring site was either empty or occupied by an a particle , the simulation step ended whereas if it was occupied by a b particle ( adsorbed in an active site due to the fact that every b particle was adsorbed exclusively on the active region ) an reaction attempt was realized with the probability @xmath31 .",

    ", the simulation step ended . * if the lattice site chosen at the beginning of the simulation step was occupied and it contained a b particle , the simulation step ended .",
    "b particles , in contradistinction to particles a , could neither diffuse nor desorb in our model and the possibility of the surface reaction in the algorithm was taken into account when a particles were considered .",
    "in monte carlo simulations some details of implementation of physical processes in the simulation algorithm are important only if quantitative results are required , e.g. if the rate constants are calculated based on the values of processes probabilities @xcite . in the presented algorithm , for example",
    ", the exclusion of the surface reaction when a b particle is found , causes that the reaction probability should be multiplied by the factor 2 if one wants to use it to calculate macroscopic quantities . in this paper",
    "we are interested only in the qualitative description of the system so absolute values of probabilities do not matter , only ratios of probabilities are important .",
    "the first stage of each simulation was an equilibration phase .",
    "due to the fact that at the beginning of each simulation the number and configuration of particles on the lattice in general was changing , it was necessary to wait until the system reaches a stationary state ( i.e. until , for given values of pressures and probabilities , numbers of adsorbed particles of each kind and the rate of the product creation were fluctuating around constant values ) .",
    "after the equilibration phase an averaging phase started  average values of numbers of adsorbed particles and the reaction rate were calculated based on a certain number of simulation steps in the stationary state .",
    "the presented algorithm was used to simulate the dynamics of processes in the model of the catalytic process with the spillover introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : sys_desc ] .",
    "parameters of simulations were chosen to correspond to assumptions which were taken during the derivation of the analytical description of the system by zhdanov and kasemo in @xcite .",
    "this means mainly that the simulations were carried out always in the high reaction rates regime and therefore the value of reaction probability was always high in comparison with probabilities of other processes .",
    "the simulations were carried out for certain sets of the model parameters to investigate the dynamics of the system for various values of reactants partial pressures .",
    "the results presented by zhdanov and kasemo @xcite show that analytical solutions derived for extreme values of partial pressures , i.e. starting either from values of @xmath20 near 0 or near 1 and used in a moderate region of pressures lead to two different types of behavior , especially that there exists multiple steady - state and hysteretic effects may occur . to verify the hypothesis about a hysteresis and to find multiple stable stationary states , for each set of model parameters , two different series of simulations were performed .",
    "the first series was started with an empty lattice for a small , close to zero , value of @xmath20 .",
    "than , when the stable stationary - state was reached and average numbers of particles were constant , results were calculated , the value of @xmath20 was increased by a certain interval and a new simulation was started ( therefore , in general , at the beginning of every next simulation the lattice was not empty ) .",
    "the procedure was repeated until the value of @xmath20 was near 1 .",
    "the second series of simulations was carried on in an analogous way but the first simulation in these series was started for @xmath20 value near 1 and in succeeding simulations @xmath20 was decreasing . in the simulations the @xmath20 value was changing in 192 steps with a 0.05 interval , from 0.02 to 0.98 in the first type series and from 0.98 to 0.02 in the second type .",
    "the simulations were carried on using both lattices consisting of active and inactive sites ( this corresponded to a catalyst with an active metal particle on the support ) and using lattices built of active sites only ( this corresponded to the system where the catalytic process occurs only on an active metal particle without contribution of the support ) .",
    "the comparison of the results obtained from both types of simulations allows to investigate the influence of the spillover effects on the considered catalytic process . in each simulation surface coverages of an active and inactive region and the surface reaction rate",

    "the reaction rate was calculated as the number of product particles created in a monte carlo step ( mc step ) .",
    "the mc step consisted of simulation steps described in sec .",
    "[ sec : sim_alg ] and the number of those steps in the mc step was equal to the number of sites in the simulation lattice .",

    "the probability of surface reaction was equal to 0.99 .",
    "probabilities of desorption of a particles from both active and inactive sites were determined as 0.5 and 0.05 respectively .",
    "the choosing of values of the two remaining probabilities in the model ( probabilities of a adsorption on active and inactive sites : @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) allows to control the spillover process and to investigate its influence on the overall catalytic process .",
    "adsorption and desorption probabilities in each simulation were fixed , i.e. they did not depended on the local configuration on the lattice , therefore lateral adsorbate - adsorbate interactions changing adsorption / desorption energy barriers were neglected . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : sim_alg ] , in a case of a qualitative analysis of simulations results , only ratios of probabilities and not their absolute values influence the dynamics of processes .",

    "b@xmath3 adsorption is the only possible process in the system .",
    "this adsorption is irreversible , however , it can not lead to 100% coverage of b particles because b@xmath3 particles adsorb on the surface with randomly chosen orientations and therefore some lattice sites remain unoccupied . as the adsorption of b@xmath3 can not occur on single - unoccupied sites ,",
    "b coverage is less than 100% .",

    "each a adsorption act enables surface reaction which in turn can produce a pair of neighboring unoccupied sites .",

    "the presence of certain amount of a particles is necessary for b particles to poison the surface .",
    "successive increasing of @xmath20 in subsequent simulations of the series can not decrease the b coverage .",
    "adsorption of b is irreversible and the only way to decrease the number of adsorbed b particles is the surface reaction with a , however , these particles are not only absent on the surface but also can not be adsorbed as well due to the absence of unoccupied sites . in result , in each simulation during the series with increasing @xmath20 the surface is poisoned by b and surface reaction can not occur .",

    "the choosing of adsorption and desorption probabilities ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) was done in such a way , to get a system with relatively small steady - state a coverages .",
    "accordingly , the surface can not be poisoned by a due to the adsorption reversibility and the maximum a coverage is relatively low ( about 0.004 )  even at @xmath20 values near 1  due to the ratio of adsorption / desorption probabilities .",
    "adsorption of b@xmath3 particles is irreversible , therefore below @xmath40 the surface is poisoned by b. the mechanism leading to 100% coverage is the same as in the simulations starting from @xmath20 near 0 . but here",
    "the reason of effectively low a coverage just before the poisoning is the consumption of a adsorbate by surface reaction .",
    "inside the reaction window b coverage is less than monolayer due to surface reaction and domination of a in the gas phase .",

    "the reaction window in our model is shifted toward high values of @xmath20 with respect to zgb because the steady - state a coverage is lower than in the zgb model .",
    "the presented results show that for the regions of @xmath20 above 0.82 at least two stable stationary states exist in the system : the state in which the reaction occurs ( reached in the dec series ) and the state with the surface poisoned by b ( reached in the inc series ) . if the simulations start with an empty surface , the system would always reach the stationary state with lower value of the surface b coverage because the final stationary state depends on initial conditions of the system . in the case of experimental investigations of such systems",

    "the comparison between fig .",
    "[ fig : particle_rate ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : spill_rate ] allows to conclude that the presence of the inactive support and diffusion of a particles from and to the active region causes three changes in the system : a new high band with a maximum located about @xmath46 occurs , the local rate maximum in the range of high values of @xmath20 increases and this maximum is shifted towards lower @xmath20 values .",
    "we conclude that the reaction in the range of high values of @xmath20 is governed by the same mechanism as in the system without the inactive support .",
    "however , for low values of @xmath20 the reaction is supported by the surface diffusion from the inactive support . in other words , in the range of high @xmath20 the reaction is governed by the adsorption channel , and for low @xmath20  by the spillover channel .",
    "these conclusions differ from ones obtained from an analytical description by zhdanov and kasemo @xcite because in our case in the presence of inactive support a band that comes from the adsorption channel still exists for high values of @xmath20 .",

    "similar results were obtained by kovalyov et al . in @xcite .",

    "we conclude , that the increasing of the local maximum appearing in the range of high pressures of a with the respect to the model without spillover , i.e. the increasing of the adsorption channel efficiency , is caused by the appearing of empty sites in the active region due to the additional removing of adsorbed particles by the surface reaction driven by spillover .",
    "the additional empty sites increase the rate of a adsorption on the active region and therefore strengthen the adsorption channel .",
    "the same mechanism is responsible for the shifting of the maximum toward lower @xmath20 values .",
    "the strengthening of the adsorption channel manifests itself not only at the position of the maximum but increases the rate of a adsorption in the whole range of pressures .",
