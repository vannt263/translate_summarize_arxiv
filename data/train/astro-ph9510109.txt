    "in the past few years , mainly after the discovery of cmb anisotropies by @xmath1/dmr ( smoot 1992 ) , the study of the topology of the universe has become an important problem for cosmologists and some hypotheses , such as the  small universe \" model ( see ellis and schreiber 1986 ) , have received considerable attention . from the theoretical point of view , it is possible to have quantum creation of the universe with a multiply - connected topology ( zeldovich and starobinsky 1984 ) . from the observational side ,",
    "this model has been used to explain the  observed \" periodicity in the distributions of quasars ( fang and sato 1985 ) and galaxies ( broadhurst 1990 ) .",
    "almost all work on  small universes \" has been limited to the case where the spatial sections form a rectangular basic cell with sides @xmath7 and with opposite faces topologically connected , a topology known as toroidal .",
    "the three - dimensional cubic torus @xmath0 is the simplest model among all possible multiply - connected topologies , in which all three sides have the same size @xmath8 . in spite of the fact that cubic @xmath0-model has been ruled out by @xmath1 results ( sokolov 1993 ; starobinsky 1993 , hereafter s93 ; stevens 1993 ; jing and fang 1994 ;",
    "de oliveira - costa and smoot 1995 , hereafter docs95 ) , the possibility that we live in a universe with a more anisotropic topology , such as a rectangular torus @xmath0 , is an open problem that has not been ruled out yet .",
    "for instance , if the toroidal model is not a cube , but a rectangle with sides @xmath9 and with one or two of its dimensions significantly smaller than the horizon @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , this small rectangular universe can not be completely excluded by any of the previous analyses : constraints from the dmr data merely require that at least one of the sides of the cell be larger than @xmath10 .    as pointed out by s93 and fang ( 1993 )",
    ", if the rectangular @xmath0-universe has one of the cell sizes smaller than the horizon and the other two cell sizes are of the order of or larger than the horizon ( for instance , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , the large scale cmb pattern shows the existence of a symmetry plane , and if it has two cell sizes smaller than the horizon and the third cell size is of the order of or larger than the horizon ( for instance , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , the cmb pattern shows the existence of a symmetry axis .",
    "we call the former case a @xmath2-model because the spatial topology of the universe becomes just @xmath2 in the limit @xmath16 with @xmath17 being fixed .",
    "the later case is denoted a @xmath3-model for the same reason ( the corresponding limit is @xmath18 with @xmath19 being fixed ) .",
    "it is clear ( and our calculations confirm it ) that dependence of cmb fluctuations on any cell size is very small once it exceeds the horizon . in previous work ( docs95 ) , we computed the full covariance matrix for all multipole components and used a @xmath20-technique to place a lower limit on the cell size @xmath21 of the cubic @xmath0-models .",
    "however , we can not apply this same approach to study the @xmath2- and @xmath3-universes . as we explain in the next section ,",
    "the observed power spectrum of these models depends not only on the cell size but also strongly on the cell orientation relative to the galaxy cut .",
    "our goal is to show that the @xmath1/dmr maps have the ability to discriminate and rule out @xmath2- and @xmath3-models .",
    "we use a different approach to study these models in which we constrain their sizes by looking for the symmetries that they would produce in the cmb , obtaining strong constraints from the 4 year @xmath1/dmr data .",
    "if the density fluctuations are adiabatic and the universe is spatially flat , the sachs - wolfe fluctuations in the cmb are given by ( , ) = - _ * k * e^i*k * ( peebles , 1982 ) , where * r * is the vector with length @xmath22 that points in the direction of observation ( @xmath23 ) , @xmath24 is the hubble constant ( written here as @xmath25  km s@xmath26 mpc@xmath26 ) and @xmath27 is the density fluctuation in fourier space , with the sum taken over all wave numbers * k*. here we neglect the difference between the horizon surface and the surface of the last scattering , which is justified for @xmath28 30 .",
    "it is customary to expand the cmb fluctuations in spherical harmonics ( , ) = _ l=0^ _ m =- l^l a_lm y_lm ( ) , where @xmath29 are the spherical harmonic coefficients and @xmath30 is the unit vector in direction @xmath31 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath29 are given by a_lm = -2i^l _ * k * j_l(kr_h ) y_lm^ * ( ) , where @xmath32 are spherical bessel functions of order @xmath33 .",
    "if we assume that the cmb fluctuations @xmath34 are a gaussian random field , the coefficients @xmath29 are gaussian random variables with zero mean and covariance matrix a_lm^*a_lm _ * k * j_l(kr_h )",
    "j_l(kr_h ) y_lm ( ) y_lm^ * ( ) . in a euclidean topology the universe is isotropic , the sum in ( [ var_alm ] ) is replaced by an integral and the power spectrum @xmath35 is related to the coefficients @xmath29 by a_lm^*a_lm c_l _ ll_mm ( see bond and efsthatiou 1987 ) .",
    "however , in a toroidal universe this is not the case . in this model ,",
    "only wave numbers that are harmonics of the cell size are allowed .",
    "we have a discrete * k * spectrum = ( , , ) ( zeldovich 1973 ; fang and houjun 1987 ) , where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are integers and @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    in previous work ( docs95 )",
    ", we set limits on the cubic @xmath0-models assuming that , for a given cell size , the quantity @xmath42 galaxy cut .",
    "in other words , if @xmath43 is almost independent of the cell orientation , we can make the approximation that all cell orientations for that given cell size can be simultaneously ruled out by a @xmath20-test on the @xmath43 coefficients and , in that way , test our model just considering changes in the cell size @xmath21 .",
    "however , in the case of more strongly anisotropic cell configurations such as @xmath2- and @xmath3-models , the quantity @xmath43 does depend on the cell orientation and the @xmath20-test on the power spectrum can not be used anymore .",
    "if we try to apply the power spectrum method to these models , it will require testing a six parameter family of models with three parameters corresponding to the cell orientation in addition to the cell sizes @xmath17 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    in order to illustrate these anisotropic cell configurations , we plot a realization of two extreme cases : a @xmath2-universe ( figure  1a , upper left ) with dimensions ( @xmath46 ) = ( 3,3,0.3 ) and a @xmath3-universe ( figure  1b , upper right ) with dimensions ( @xmath46 ) = ( 0.3,0.3,3 ) .",
    "both models are plotted in galactic coordinates and have a scale invariant power spectrum ( @xmath5=1 ) . from equations ( [ sachs_wolfe ] ) and ( [ kcut ] )",
    ", we see that when one of the cell sizes is smaller than the horizon ( @xmath2-models ) , the temperatures @xmath34 are almost independent of this coordinate .",
    "for instance if @xmath471 , the values of @xmath34 are almost independent of the @xmath48-coordinate , , the values of @xmath34 are symmetric about the plane formed by the @xmath49 and @xmath50-axes .",
    "this happens because of the factor @xmath51 in equation ( [ sachs_wolfe ] ) .",
    "if we assume a power - law power spectrum with @xmath5=1 , the value of this factor scales as @xmath52 , so that most of the contribution to the sum comes from small @xmath53-values . if @xmath471 , the term @xmath54 in equation ( [ kcut ] ) will be much greater than unity when @xmath55 0 , so the term with @xmath56 0 will dominate the sum .",
    "since this term is independent of the @xmath48-coordinate , the entire sum will be approximatelly independent of @xmath48 . in the same way , if two cell sizes are smaller than the horizon ( @xmath3-models ) , the temperatures @xmath34 are aproximately independent of these coordinates .",
    "for instance if @xmath571 , the values of @xmath34 are almost independent of both @xmath49 and @xmath50 , , the values of @xmath34 are almost constant along rings around the @xmath48-axis .",
    "the results above remain valid for a much broader range of @xmath5-values ( actually , @xmath58 3 ) .",
    "thus , the following analysis is applicable in _ any _ other large scale cmb experiment as well as one - degree cmb experiments .",
    "although the existence of these symmetry patterns in the large scale fluctuations @xmath34 do not depend on the assumptions of gaussian statistics and absence of correlation between multipoles ( see s93 ) , we use both of these standard assumptions in this analysis .",
    "the analysis of @xmath2- and @xmath3-models is not an easy task , since there are infinitely many combinations of different cell sizes and cell orientations . in order to keep our analysis simple",
    ", we wish to adopt a statistic that is independent of cell orientation .",
    "in addition , we want a statistic that is precisely sensitive to the type of symmetries that small universes produce , so that it can rule out as many false models as possible .",
    "finally , we would like to have a statistic that is easy to compute and that produces results that are easy to interpret .",
    "having these criteria in mind , we choose a statistic in which we calculate the function @xmath59 defined by s(_i ) _",
    "j=1^n_pix , where @xmath60 is the number of pixels that remain in the map after the galaxy cut have taken place , @xmath61 denotes the reflection of @xmath62 in the plane whose normal is @xmath63 , , _",
    "ij = _ j - 2 ( _ i _ j ) _ i and @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the errors associated with the pixels in the directions @xmath62 and @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath59 is a measure of how much reflection symmetry there is in the mirror plane perpendicular to @xmath63 .",
    "the more perfect the symmetry is , the smaller @xmath59 will be .",
    "when we calculate @xmath59 for all 6144 pixels at the positions @xmath63 , we obtain a sky map that we refer to as an @xmath66-map .",
    "this sky map is a useful visualization tool and gives intuitive understanding of how the statistic @xmath59 works .    in order to better understand @xmath59 , we first consider the simple model of a @xmath2-universe with @xmath471 . for this specific model ,",
    "the values of @xmath34 are almost independent of the @xmath48-coordinate , so we have almost perfect mirror symmetry about the @xmath67-plane or , in spherical coordinates , @xmath68 .",
    "when @xmath63 points in the direction of the smallest cell size ( , @xmath48-direction ) , we have @xmath69 1 ; otherwise , @xmath70 1 .",
    "an @xmath66-map for a @xmath2-model ( @xmath46 ) = ( 3,3,0.3 ) can be seen in figure  1c ( lower left ) .",
    "notice in this plot that the direction in which the cell is smallest can be easily identified by two ",
    "dark spots \" at @xmath71 and @xmath72 . for @xmath3-models",
    ", the only difference will be that in the place of the two  dark spots \" , we have a  dark ring \" structure in the plane formed by the two small directions .",
    "see figure  1d ( lower right ) , an @xmath66-map of the @xmath3-model ( @xmath46 ) = ( 0.3,0.3,3 ) .    from these two @xmath66-maps , we can infer two important properties : first , the direction in which the @xmath66-map takes its minimum value , denoted @xmath73 , is the direction in which the universe is small . for a large universe such as ( 3,3,3 ) , the @xmath73-directions obtained from different realizations are randomly distributed in the sky .",
    "secondly , the distribution of @xmath73-values changes with the cell size , , as the universe becomes smaller , the values of @xmath73 decrease . from the definition of the @xmath66-map , it is easy to see that the value of @xmath73 is independent of the cell orientation .",
    "in other words , if we rotate the cell , we will just be rotating the @xmath66-map , leaving its minimum value @xmath73 unchanged .",
    "a value of @xmath73 from a particular realization of a stochastic cosmological perturbation differs from the expectation value @xmath74 due to cosmic variance .",
    "this comes from the non - symmetric part of @xmath34 fluctuations produced by perturbation modes with @xmath75 . for these modes",
    ", the main contribution to @xmath76 in ( [ smin_plane ] ) is made by the terms in the sum for which @xmath77 and @xmath61 are widely separated , so that we can neglect their cross - correlation . since @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the r.m.s .",
    "value of the non - symmetric part of @xmath34 and @xmath80 is the r.m.s .",
    "noise , we have that the cosmic variance is @xmath81 . here",
    "@xmath82 is the characteristic multipole for @xmath1 data ( the inverse angular correlation radius ) and @xmath83 .",
    "we shall confirm this rough estimate in more details below ; see the behavior of curves for the cumulative probability distribution of @xmath73 in figure  2 .    in summary ,",
    "our statistic @xmath73 has all the properties that we desire : it quantifies the  smallness \" of a sky map in a single number , it is independent of the cell orientation , and it is easy to work with and to interpret .    from here on , we will present our results in terms of the cell sizes @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , usually sorted as @xmath87 .",
    "we remind the reader that the results are identical for all six permutations of @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "we rewrite the exponential in equation ( [ sachs_wolfe ] ) as e^i*k * = + i = ( 2 ) + i ( 2 ) , where @xmath88 is given by ( [ kcut ] ) , @xmath31 is the vector with lenght @xmath89 and @xmath90 . if the density fluctuation in fourier space @xmath27 has random phases , we have @xmath91 , so that @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is a constant and @xmath94 and @xmath95 are two independent gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance . assuming a power law power spectrum with shape @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the amplitude of scalar perturbations and @xmath5 the spectral index , we have @xmath98 , so that the of the term @xmath51 in ( [ sachs_wolfe ] ) is given by ^ , where @xmath99 . substituting ( [ exponential ] ) and ( [ deltak_k ] ) into ( [ sachs_wolfe ] ) , we can construct simulated skies by calculating ( , ) _",
    "p_x , p_y , p_z ^.    since the cubic @xmath0 case has already been ruled out as an interesting cosmological model ( see docs95 ) , we restrict our analysis here to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 cases for @xmath5=1 .",
    "this is a two parameter family of models specified by @xmath84 and @xmath85 , with @xmath100 . for numerical convenience ,",
    "we set @xmath86=3 instead , as this is found to give virtually the same results as @xmath100 .",
    "we adopt @xmath5=1 , as we found that  small universe \" models with different @xmath5-values are even more inconsistent with the observed data .",
    "the large scale fluctuations observed on the celestial sphere by a cmb experiment can be modeled as being the fluctuations given in ( [ new_sw ] ) multiplied by an experimental beam function e^-(r_h ) ^2/2 , where @xmath101 is the length of the @xmath88-component perpendicular to the line of sight and @xmath102 is the width of the gaussian beam given by @xmath103 , where fwhm is the full width of the beam at its half maximum .",
    "we make the approximation that the sky area covered by the beam is flat ( this is equivalent to smoothing in the plane perpendicular to the line of sight @xmath104 ) . since @xmath105 , we have that @xmath106 .",
    "we use fwhm = 7@xmath107 in our simulations , which is the fwhm of the @xmath1/dmr beam .    in the real sky map",
    ", we do not have complete sky coverage .",
    "because of the uncertainty in galaxy emission , we are forced to remove all pixels less than @xmath108 below and above the galaxy plane , which represents a loss of almost 34% of all pixels . however , performing monte carlo simulations with and without the galaxy cut , we find that the galaxy cut does not change the final distribution of @xmath73 much .",
    "due to the smaller data sample , the galaxy cut weakens the lower limit on the cell size slightly ( see scott 1994 ) .",
    "we model the noise @xmath109 at each pixel @xmath110 as independent gaussian random variables with mean @xmath1110 and variance @xmath112 ( lineweaver 1994 ) , and add it to the temperature values given by ( [ new_sw ] ) .",
    "the level of noise in the dmr maps is a source of serious concern in our analysis : high levels of noise can make it impossible to discriminate between the different topological models . in order to reduce the noise and",
    "increase the signal - to - noise ratio in the simulated skies and real data , we smooth both once more by 7@xmath107 before calculating @xmath66-map , which corresponds to a total smearing of @xmath113 .    we generate our simulated skies as standard dmr maps with 6144 pixels for @xmath5=1 , with a galaxy cut of 20@xmath107 , fwhm = 7@xmath107 , the monopole and dipole removed , add noise and normalize to @xmath114k ( the value at 7@xmath107 extracted from our dmr map , a 4 year combined 53 plus 90 ghz map with monopole and dipole removed ) .",
    "fixing a cell size , we construct a simulated sky according to ( [ new_sw ] ) , we smooth this once more by 7@xmath107 and use the statistic defined in ( [ smin_plane ] ) to obtain an @xmath66-map from which we extract its minimum value @xmath73 . repeating this procedure 1000 times",
    ", we obtain the probability distribution of @xmath73 for that fixed cell size .",
    "when we repeat this same procedure for different cell sizes , we are able to construct figure  2 .    in figure  2a ( upper plot ) , we show the cumulative probability distribution of @xmath73 obtained from the monte carlo simulations for the cell sizes ( @xmath46 ) = ( 0.5,0.5,3 ) , ( 0.6,0.6,3 ) , ( 0.7,0.7,3 ) and ( 3,3,3 ) .",
    "the horizontal lines indicate the confidence levels of 95% , 90% and 68% ( from top to bottom ) . comparing these curves with",
    "the value @xmath115 = 2.59 ( represented in the plot by the vertical straight line ) , where @xmath115 is the @xmath73 value extracted from our data set , we conclude that @xmath3-models with smallest cell sizes @xmath1160.5 can be ruled out at 95% confidence .",
    "as the second cell size @xmath85 is increased , the curves shift to the left of the @xmath3-models and we can rule out @xmath2-models for @xmath1170.5 at a similar confidence level , see figure  2b ( lower plot ) . in this plot",
    ", we show the cumulative probability distribution of @xmath73 obtained from monte carlo simulations for the cell sizes ( @xmath46 ) = ( 0.5,3,3 ) , ( 0.6,3,3 ) , ( 0.7,3,3 ) and ( 3,3,3 ) .",
    "a more complete picture of the cell size limits is obtained when we construct a two - dimensional grid for different values of the cell sizes ( @xmath46 ) with @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( see figure  3 ) .",
    "the thin - shaded , thick - shaded and grey regions correspond , respectively , to the models ruled out at 68% , 90% and 95% confidence .",
    "notice in this plot that all contours are almost @xmath21-shaped , which means that , to a good approximation , the level in which a model ( @xmath120 ) is ruled out depends only on the _ smallest _ cell size , @xmath121 .",
    "we see that @xmath1220.5 at 95% confidence .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath1/dmr maps have the ability to discriminate and rule out @xmath2 and @xmath3 topological models .",
    "we have presented a new statistic to study these anisotropic models which quantifies the  smallness \" of a sky map in a single number , @xmath73 , which is independent of the cell orientation , is easy to work with and is easy to interpret .    from the @xmath1/dmr data , we obtain a lower limit for @xmath2- and @xmath3-models of @xmath1230.5 , which corresponds to a cell size with smallest dimension of @xmath21=3000@xmath4mpc .",
    "this limit is at 95% confidence and assumes @xmath5=1 .",
    "since the topology is interesting only if the cell size is considerably smaller than the horizon , so that it can ( at least in principle ) be directly observed , these models lose most of their appeal . since the cubic @xmath0 case has already been ruled out as an interesting cosmological model ( see docs95 ) , and @xmath2- and @xmath3-models for small cell sizes are ruled out , this means that _ all _ toroidal models ( cubes and rectangles ) are ruled out as interesting cosmological models .",
