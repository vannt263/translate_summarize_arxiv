    "the ngc 7332 and ngc 1156 regions are the first two completely surveyed areas from the arecibo galaxy environment survey ( ages ) .",
    "the survey aims to address a number of scientific goals , including the hi mass function in different environments , the contribution of neutral gas to the baryonic mass density , the identification of gaseous tidal features , and the identification of isolated neutral gas clouds . in order to do this",
    ", ages is investigating galaxies in a number of different environments , from the local void through to the virgo cluster .",
    "these environments include three isolated galaxies ( ngc 1156 , described here , ugc 2082 , and ngc 5233 ) and two galaxy pairs ( ngc 7332/9 , described here , and ngc 2577/ugc 4375 ) .",
    "a full description of the aims of the survey , which is expected to be concluded in around four to five years , can be found in auld et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and on the ages website .",
    "ngc 7332 and ngc 7339 form a close pair ( 5.2 arc minutes separation ) with velocities of 1172 and 1313 kms@xmath2 respectively .",
    "they lie at a distance of 23 mpc ( tonry et al .",
    "2001 , from surface - brightness fluctuations ) , giving a projected separation of 35 kpc .",
    "we adopt the tonry et al .",
    "distance throughout this paper and convert masses and fluxes from the literature to this distance .",
    "ngc 7332 itself is an s0 galaxy ; whether or not it contains neutral hydrogen has been debated in the literature for many years .",
    "knapp , kerr & williams ( 1978 ) , using arecibo with the circular - polarised l - band feed ( fwhm @xmath3 arcmin ) , claimed a detection with an hi mass @xmath4 .",
    "biermann , clarke & fricke ( 1979 ) , using the same receiver , also see this signal but attribute it to side - lobe contamination from ngc 7339 .",
    "haynes ( 1981 ) and burstein , krumm & salpeter ( 1987 ) both observed the galaxy using arecibo with the linear - polarised l - band feed ( fwhm @xmath5 arcmin ) , which had significantly lower side - lobes than the circular - polarised feed but also less sensitivity ( 6 k jy@xmath2 versus 8 k jy@xmath2 ) , and balkowski & chamaraux ( 1983 ) observed it with the nanay radio telescope ( fwhm @xmath6 arcmin ) .",
    "none of these observations had the sensitivity to detect the signal seen by knapp et al . ,",
    "although haynes ( 1983 ) discusses the knapp et al .",
    "detection and attributes it to side - lobes .",
    "ionized hydrogen has been detected in ngc 7332 ( plana & boulesteix 1996 ) which extends over the velocity range of the knapp et al .",
    "neutral hydrogen detection .",
    "this ionized gas is organised into two dynamically separate discs , one of which ( the more massive ) is counter - rotating with respect to the stars .",
    "the ionized gas in ngc 7332 was also examined by falcn - barroso et al .",
    "they found that `` ngc 7332 is young everywhere '' and that there was `` a significant amount of unsettled gas '' , suggesting that `` ngc 7332 is still evolving '' . both falcn - barroso et al . and",
    "plana & boulesteix find that a recent accretion event is the likely source of the counter - rotating gas disc .",
    "falcn - barroso et al . also suggest that the same event could have led to the formation of the bar in this galaxy , and that later accretion may be required to explain some other features of the ionized gas distribution .",
    "morganti et al .",
    "( 2006 ) observed ngc 7332 with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) .",
    "they did not detect any gas at the position of ngc 7332 but did detect the gas in ngc 7339 and also found a cloud with an hi mass of @xmath7 around 3 arc minutes from ngc 7332 , in the direction of ngc 7339 , which they attribute to an interaction between the two galaxies .",
    "ngc 7339 is a nearly edge - on sbc galaxy .",
    "it has been observed a number of times in the hi line .",
    "springob et al .",
    "( 2005 ) find a neutral hydrogen mass of @xmath8 after correction for the size of the galaxy , which is consistent with the mass of @xmath9 found by staveley - smith & davies ( 1987 ) with the lovell telescope at jodrell bank .",
    "besides the two giant galaxies , two dwarf spheroidal galaxies , kkr 72 and kkr 73 , have been noted by karachentseva , karachentsev & richter ( 1999 ) as being possibly associated with the group following a careful search of poss ii films .",
    "attempts to observe hi in these galaxies by huchtmeier , karachentsev & karachentseva ( 2000 ) reached a limit of around @xmath10 but did not detect anything .    the region behind ngc 7332 is poorly studied .",
    "there are only nine redshifts for galaxies in ned . directly behind ngc 7332",
    "lie a succession of void regions , identified by fairall ( 1998 ) as parts of the delphinus , cygnus and pegasus voids .",
    "the ages region lies within , but close to the edge of , these voids out to @xmath11 kms@xmath2 .",
    "the survey area of @xmath12 equates to a physical area of 0.8 mpc@xmath13 at the distance of ngc 7332 , allowing us to see a wide region around the galaxy pair .",
    "ages observations of this region are particularly motivated by the possibility of finding interaction remnants from ngc 7332 and ngc 7339 along with searching their local environment for dwarf galaxies .",
    "ngc 1156 is a nearby , star - forming , irregular galaxy at a redshift of 375 kms@xmath2 .",
    "it is similar in both optical appearance and hi mass to the large magellanic cloud .",
    "the galaxy is listed in the isolated galaxy catalogue of karachentseva , lebedev & shcherbanovskij ( 1973 ) as one of the most isolated galaxies in the nearby universe , with no companion within 10@xmath14 .",
    "karachentsev , musella & grimaldi ( 1996 ) estimated its distance as 7.8 mpc ( on the basis of the brightest stars ) ; we have adopted this estimate in this paper .",
    "the nearest significant companion ( taken to be one with at least 10 per cent of the @xmath15-band luminosity ) is ugc 2259 which lies at an angular separation of 12.5 degrees and a distance from earth of 10 mpc ( tully & fisher 1988 ) , giving it a @xmath15-band luminosity of 11 per cent of ngc 1156 and a distance from ngc 1156 of 2.9 mpc .",
    "the closest galaxy of a similar or larger size ( one with at least 50 per cent of the @xmath15-band luminosity ) is ngc 1023 at an angular separation of 14.4 degrees and a distance from earth of 10.4 mpc ( ajhar et al .",
    "1997 ) , giving it a @xmath15-band luminosity around 400 times larger than ngc 1156 and a distance from ngc 1156 of 3.4 mpc .",
    "a number of studies have included the galaxy , due to its isolation and its status as a relatively close , irregular galaxy with fairly active star formation .",
    "relevant data from these studies is described below .",
    "swaters et al .",
    "( 2002 ) observed ngc 1156 with the wsrt as part of the whisp ( westerbork hi survery of spiral and irregular galaxies ) project .",
    "these data show a clumpy hi morphology at small scales , with holes and knots particularly visible in the outskirts , and possible signs of a warp in the central regions .",
    "swaters et al . found an hi flux of 71.3 jy kms@xmath2 , giving @xmath16 .",
    "this is consistent with the 71.27 jy kms@xmath2 green bank 43-m measurement of haynes et al .",
    "( 1998 ) which , with a beam - size of 21 arcminutes , should not resolve the galaxy .",
    "haynes et al .",
    "estimate a finite source size correction of 2 per cent for their ngc 1156 measurement , giving a final flux of 72.72 jy kms@xmath2 .",
    "barazza , binggelli & prugniel ( 2001 ) included ngc 1156 in their sample of nearby field galaxies .",
    "they measured a extinction - corrected @xmath15 magnitude of @xmath17 and extinction - corrected colors of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this gives an absolute @xmath15 magnitude of @xmath20 and an hi mass to light ratio ( using the swaters et al .",
    "hi mass ) of @xmath21 , which is fairly typical for a magellanic irregular .",
    "ngc 1156 was included in the sample of galaxies studied in h@xmath22 by james et al .",
    "they found an @xmath23-band magnitude of @xmath24 ( uncorrected for extinction ) , and a star formation rate ( using our adopted distance of 7.8 mpc ) of @xmath25 yr@xmath2 .",
    "the kinematics of ngc 1156 were studied in detail by hunter et al .",
    "( 2002 ) as part of a study of star - forming irregular galaxies .",
    "they found that the kinematical axes of the ionized gas , neutral gas and stellar discs were probably aligned at a position angle of @xmath26 .",
    "this is markedly different from the morphological position angle of @xmath27 , due to the light of the galaxy being dominated by its bar . in the hi",
    ", they report a structure resembling a tiny tidal tail to the north - east of the galaxy , terminating in an hi complex with a large velocity width .",
    "the background region behind ngc 1156 passes through the outskirts of the taurus void ( fairall 1998 ) .",
    "it is only marginally better studied than the ngc 7332 region , with 12 redshifts in ned ( not including ngc 1156 itself ) , many of them from the springob et al .",
    "( 2005 ) arecibo general catalog .",
    "two groups have been identified at just over 10 000 kms@xmath2 : wbl 091 ( white et al .",
    "1999 ) and pps2 187 ( trasarti - battistoni 1998 ) .",
    "the ages observations of the ngc 1156 region cover an area of @xmath28 , equivalent to 0.09 mpc@xmath13 at the distance of ngc 1156 .",
    "the observations are particularly motivated by the possibility of finding low surface - brightness companions and dwarf galaxies that have evaded optical detection but that may have interacted ( or even be interacting ) with ngc 1156 .",
    "the hi survey observations of the ngc 1156 region were carried out using the 305-m telescope at arecibo observatory between december 2005 and february 2006 and those of the ngc 7332 region between july and september , 2006 . both sets of observations used the arecibo l - band feed array multibeam system and the fixed - azimuth drift observing mode to reach an integration time of around 300 s point@xmath2 .",
    "the data reduction used the standard ages pipeline ( cortese et al .",
    "2008 ) , which is based on that used for hipass ( barnes et al .",
    "2001 ) and uses the livedata and gridzilla multibeam processing packages .",
    "baseline estimation and calibration were carried out using livedata , which estimates the baseline to be removed by median combining an entire drift scan , and the reduced spectra were gridded into a datacube using gridzilla .",
    "the reduced data cubes were hanning - smoothed with a width of three channels , giving a velocity resolution of 10 kms@xmath2 and a noise of 0.75 mjy channel@xmath2 beam@xmath2 .",
    "the final beam resolution ( from 2-d gaussian fitting on the 670 mjy continuum source 4c + 24.59 which is close to ngc 7332 ; condon et al .",
    "1998 ) was 3.4 arc minutes ( the same as the input beam ) .",
    "the standard ages pipeline is optimized for point sources and , as such , does not give the correct flux for extended sources such as ngc 7339 ( in the ngc 7332 field ) and ngc 1156 .",
    "there are two reasons for this : firstly the baseline estimation carried out in livedata can remove flux if a strong source fills a significant portion of a scan and secondly the gridding is optimised to correctly reconstruct the flux of a point - source at the pixel center .    in order to overcome this problem ,",
    "we have formed a extended - source cubes of the regions around ngc 1156 and ngc 7332 using the minmed bandpass estimator in livedata ( putman et al .",
    "2002 ) and without applying the beam normalization in gridzilla .",
    "this gives a reduction in the flux of point sources but gives correct fluxes for gas that overfills the beam .",
    "following hanning smoothing , the noise in the extended - source cubes was 0.4 mjy beam@xmath2 for the ngc 7332 and 0.7 mjy beam@xmath2 for ngc 1156 ( implying that the bandpass estimate from minmed was not as effective for ngc 1156 as for ngc 7332 ) .",
    "the gridded beam remained at 3.4 arc minutes , giving a 3@xmath29 sensitivity to extended emission that fills or overfills the beam of @xmath30 atoms @xmath31 in ngc 7332 and @xmath32 atoms @xmath31 in ngc 1156 .",
    "the difference between the standard and extended cubes can be seen in fig .",
    "[ cube - comparison ] .",
    "the standard cube has a ` shadow ' in the scan direction ( r.a . ) caused by ngc 7332 being included in the determination of the baseline .",
    "this causes the extension of ngc 7332 in the r.a .",
    "direction to be visibly truncated on the standard cube as well as removing flux from the whole galaxy .",
    "the fluxes of the extended sources ( ngc 7339 and ngc 1156 ) were found by fitting a 2d gaussian ( using the miriad routine imfit to a moment 0 map of each source made from the relevant extended - source optimised cube .",
    "the measured flux was then beam - corrected using a size for the beam of 3.4 arc minutes .",
    "in addition to the flux , this method fits the position , deconvolved size , and position angle of the source .",
    "as described in the sections on ngc 7339 and ngc 1156 , this gives an estimate of the flux of these galaxies that is consistent with previous measurements .",
    "the spectral parameters of the extended sources were measured on summed and beam - corrected spectra formed in an 11 by 11 arc minute box , also on the extended - source optimised cubes      the survey data is affected by radio frequency interference ( rfi ) at 1350 mhz from the federal aviation authority radar at pico del este .",
    "this is seen at @xmath33 kms@xmath2 .",
    "an intermod of the punta salinas radar at 1241.7 mhz appears in the data at @xmath34 kms@xmath2 .",
    "as these radar signals are present in all or nearly all of the observations , they are not removed by median combining the data .",
    "the other major source of rfi is the gps l3 beacon at 1380 mhz , which is seen at @xmath35 kms@xmath2 in the data .",
    "however , this only transmits intermittently and is therefore mostly removed when the data are combined .",
    "extra care is taken when identifying previously uncataloged sources at this redshift to ensure that they are true hi sources and not gps transmissions .",
    "the ngc 7332 cube was searched independently by eye by two members of the team ( rm & em ) .",
    "detections were classified as ` solid ' or ` dubious ' .",
    "any detections not classified as ` solid ' by both searchers were targetted for follow - up observations .",
    "these were carried out with the l - band wide and alfa receivers at arecibo observatory during the summer of 2008 .",
    "the ngc 1156 cube was searched by two members of the team ( ra & luca cortese ) and using an automated searching algorithm ( see cortese et al .",
    "2008 for details ) .",
    "any detections with a signal to noise of less than 7 ( calculated retrospectively from the measured parameters , see below for details ) were followed up with the l - band wide receiver at arecibo observatory during the winter of 2006 and the fall of 2009 .",
    "all of the sources in the catalog presented here ( table [ catalogue ] ) are either therefore considered solid detections on the original ages cubes or have been confirmed by follow - up observations .",
    "the data is presented in the same format as cortese et al .",
    "( 2008 ) : column 1 gives the ages hi source i d .",
    "columns 2 and 3 give the right ascension of the hi source and its associated error ( in seconds of right ascension ) .",
    "columns 3 and 4 give the declination of the hi source and its associated error ( in seconds of arc ) .",
    "column 6 gives the heliocentric velocity ( @xmath36 ) and associated error , measured as the mid - point of the hi profile at 50 per cent of the peak flux .",
    "columns 7 and 8 give the observed width of the hi profile ( not corrected for instrumental broadening , turbulent motions , etc . ) at 50 and 20 per cent respectively of the peak flux , along with their associated errors .",
    "column 9 gives the peak flux density and its associated error .",
    "column 10 gives the integrated flux and its associated error .",
    "column 11 gives the object flags , defined as follows : flag 0 is a source securely detected in the survey data ; flag 1 is a source confirmed by follow - up observations ; flag 2 is a source contaminated by rfi ( none of the sources in the regions reported in this paper have this flag ) ; flag 3 marks extended sources , measured as described in section 2.1 .",
    "the hi parameters in table [ catalogue ] were derived as in cortese et al .",
    "2008 using the miriad routine mbspect .",
    "uncertainties were derived using the equations from koribalski et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , e.g. @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the channel width and @xmath39 is taken to be the quadrature sum of the rms measured off - source and @xmath40 , e.g. @xmath41 .",
    "the uncertainty is the sytematic velocity is given by @xmath42 ; errors in the widths are given by @xmath43 and @xmath44 . the positions and their associated errors are from the fitting of a gaussian to the source in mbspect , the errors are the formal errors on the fit and , while they are indicative of the quality of the fit , do not correspond directly to the offset between the hi position and the optical position and appear to underestimate the true uncertainty in the position by a factor of around three ( see section 5.3 ) .",
