    "given a numerical simulation of a spacetime containing a black hole , one is faced with two immediate questions : where is the black hole , and what are the values of its parameters , such as mass and angular momentum ?    in analytical considerations , a black hole is often defined via the event horizon , i.e.  the future boundary of the causal past of future null infinity . while this notion is mathematically elegant and has led to powerful results in black hole physics , generally it is not directly useful in numerical evolutions of black hole spacetimes .",
    "the reason is the teleological nature of the event horizon : it can be constructed only after we have knowledge of the entire spacetime and spacetime is the _",
    "end product _ of these simulations .",
    "furthermore , due to practical limitations , generally one can not evolve all the way to future null infinity .",
    "for such reasons , in numerical evolutions , it is more common to use _ apparent horizons _ to characterize a black hole .",
    "apparent horizons are closed two - surfaces on a spatial slice of the spacetime and are , therefore , well suited to numerical simulations that evolve data from one spatial slice to another .",
    "while it is possible that there exist no apparent horizons on the spatial slices used in a given numerical simulation of a black hole spacetime , in practice , this issue does not arise for most numerical black hole simulations that we are aware of .",
    "we shall therefore disregard this issue for the rest of this paper and only deal with partial cauchy surfaces ( in black hole spacetimes ) for which apparent horizons do exist and have been located @xcite . a natural question we want to ask is :",
    "can one unambiguously associate black hole parameters to apparent horizons ?",
    "one way to attribute a mass and an angular momentum to a black hole is to calculate the corresponding adm quantities at infinity .",
    "the main difficulty is that the adm mass and angular momentum refer to the whole spacetime . in a dynamical situation ,",
    "such a spacetime will contain gravitational radiation and it is not clear how much of the mass or angular momentum should be attributed to the black hole itself and , if there is more than one black hole , to each individual black hole .",
    "it is desirable to have a framework that combines the properties of apparent horizons with the powerful tools available at infinity . in the regime",
    "when the black hole is isolated in an otherwise dynamical spacetime , such a framework now exists in the form of isolated horizons @xcite . in numerical simulations of , say , black hole collisions ,",
    "the black hole would be isolated at early times when the black holes are well separated , or at late times when the final black hole has settled down , but radiation is still present in the spacetime .",
    "isolated horizons provide a way to identify a black hole quasi - locally , and allow for the calculation of mass and angular momentum .",
    "it has been shown recently that the formulae for angular momentum and mass arising from the isolated horizon formalism are valid even in dynamical situations @xcite .",
    "therefore , the numerical methods presented in this article are relevant even for fully dynamical black holes .",
    "the aim of this paper is to introduce the isolated horizon framework in a way that is directly useful in numerical relativity .",
    "in particular , we show how to find isolated horizons numerically , and how to implement the isolated horizon formulae for @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "a key result of this paper is that , to find the angular momentum of an isolated horizon , one can just use the adm formula for angular momentum but now applied at the apparent horizon .",
    "this is not an assumption , but a rigorous result obtained by calculating the hamiltonian generating diffeomorphisms which reduce to rotational symmetries on the isolated horizon .",
    "this is completely analogous to what is done at infinity to obtain the adm formulae for mass and angular momentum for asymptotically flat spacetimes .",
    "indeed , the hamiltonian analysis of isolated horizons is an extension of the adm formalism to the case where the region of spacetime under consideration has an inner boundary in the form of an isolated horizon .",
    "the isolated horizon results for @xmath1 and @xmath0 are also convenient for practical reasons because their expressions only involve data defined on the apparent horizon .",
    "an important ingredient in the formula for @xmath1 is an axial symmetry vector on the apparent horizon .",
    "therefore we also present and implement a numerical method for locating killing vectors on the horizon .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : ih ] we first review the notion of isolated horizons and explain how they can be located in numerical simulations of black hole spacetimes . we also explain their relation to apparent horizons and give the formulae for their mass and angular momentum .",
    "these formulae require that we find a killing vector on the apparent horizon .",
    "a method for doing this is described in section [ sec : killingvec ] .",
    "section [ sec : numeric ] describes the practical numerical implementation of these formulae , and we verify that our method gives the expected results in the simple case of a boosted kerr black hole .",
    "section [ sec : discussion ] compares the isolated horizon formulae with other approaches used to compute mass and angular momentum , and finally in section [ sec : conclusion ] we give some possible applications and future directions .",
    "let us first fix our notation .",
    "the spacetime metric is taken to have signature @xmath2 , and we use geometrical units where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are equal to unity .",
    "we will usually use the abstract index notation , but occasionally , especially for differential forms , the index free notation will also be used .",
    "the riemann tensor @xmath5 will be defined by the equation @xmath6}\\alpha_c={r_{abc}}^d\\alpha_d$ ] where @xmath7 is an arbitrary co - vector .",
    "we work on a spacetime that is foliated by a spatial three manifold @xmath8 which is a partial cauchy surface .",
    "the spacetime is thus of the form @xmath9 . the three - metric and extrinsic curvature on a spatial slice @xmath8 are respectively denoted by @xmath10 and @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the unit timelike normal to @xmath8 .",
    "the two - metric on the apparent horizon is called @xmath13 . all manifolds and fields",
    "will be taken to be smooth . finally ,",
    "though it is quite easy to include matter fields , we will be interested in vacuum spacetimes only .",
    "this paper is reasonably self contained , however , for precise and detailed definitions and proofs we refer the reader to @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall focus on the basic physical ideas underlying the isolated horizon framework and its application to numerical relativity .",
    "for completeness and to fix notation , let us start by reviewing the definition of apparent horizons .",
    "let @xmath12 be the unit timelike vector field orthogonal to a partial cauchy surface @xmath8 .",
    "given a closed two - surface @xmath14 , we have the unique unit outward - pointing spacelike normal @xmath15 which is tangent to @xmath8 .",
    "we are assuming here that one can define what is meant by the inside and outside of @xmath16 .",
    "this can be done , for instance , by imposing certain global conditions on the spacetime and the partial cauchy surfaces under consideration .",
    "these conditions include : asymptotic flatness , strong future asymptotic predictability of the spacetime with the cauchy surfaces under consideration and certain topological restrictions on @xmath8 . since the focus of this paper is not on such global topological properties of spacetimes , we shall not spell out these assumptions precisely and instead refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the inside and outside @xmath16 can also be defined quasi - locally without using global assumptions such as the ones mentioned above",
    ". this has been done by hayward @xcite using the notion of trapping horizons which we discuss in a later section .",
    "let @xmath13 be the induced riemannian two - metric on @xmath16 and @xmath17 the area two - form on @xmath16 constructed from @xmath13 .",
    "we can construct a convenient basis for performing calculations at points of @xmath16 in a natural way ( see figure [ fig : ihah ] ) .",
    "first , define the outgoing and ingoing null vectors @xmath18 it is worth noting that any spacelike two - surface @xmath16 determines uniquely , up to rescalings , two null vectors orthogonal to @xmath16 .",
    "any other choice of @xmath19 and @xmath20 will differ from the one made in equation ( [ eq : normals ] ) only by possible rescalings .",
    "we tie together the scalings of @xmath19 and @xmath20 by requiring @xmath21 .",
    "next , given two arbitrarily chosen spacelike orthonormal vectors @xmath22 and @xmath23 tangent to @xmath16 , construct a complex null vector @xmath24 it satisfies the relations @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . since @xmath19 and @xmath20 satisfy @xmath29 , we see that @xmath30 form a null tetrad at @xmath16 .",
    "this is , of course , only one possible choice of null tetrad , and we must ensure that physical results are independent of this choice .",
    "the expansions of @xmath31 and @xmath32 are defined as @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "note that in order to find the expansions , we only need derivatives of @xmath19 and @xmath20 along @xmath16 , and there is no need to extend the null tetrad into the full spacetime . however , if in some numerical computations it is necessary to extend the null tetrad smoothly into the full spacetime ; all calculations will be insensitive to this extension .",
    "the surface @xmath16 is said to be an apparent horizon if it is the outermost outer - marginally - trapped - surface , i.e.  it is the outermost surface on @xmath8 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "consider now the world tube of apparent horizons @xmath37 constructed by stacking together the apparent horizons on different spatial slices . as we shall show later in section",
    "[ sec : trappinghor ] , smooth segments of this world tube are generically spacelike ; it is null when no matter or radiation is falling into the black hole . at late times",
    ", one expects the black hole to reach equilibrium when radiation and matter are no longer crossing the horizon . in this regime ,",
    "the world tube @xmath37 will be a null surface , and the two - metric @xmath13 on the apparent horizon @xmath16 may now be viewed as a degenerate three - metric on the null surface @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , from experience with numerical simulations and also from general topological censorship results ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , we know that at late times , the apparent horizons must have spherical topology .",
    "therefore , at late times , the topology of @xmath37 is @xmath38 .",
    "finally , in this regime , the outward - normal @xmath19 constructed in equation ( [ eq : normals ] ) is a null normal to the world tube @xmath37 , and most importantly , from the definition of an apparent horizon , the outward normal @xmath19 is always expansion free .    we will now argue that the isolated horizon framework is ideally suited to describe apparent horizons in the regime when the world tube @xmath37 is null .",
    "for our purposes , the straightforward definition of a _ non - expanding horizon _ given below shall suffice . to carry out the hamiltonian analysis in order to define mass and angular momentum , we actually need to impose further conditions on non - expanding horizons , which we shall briefly describe towards the end of this section .",
    "the formulae for mass and angular momentum make sense even on non - expanding horizons .",
    "+ * definition * : a three dimensional sub - manifold @xmath39 of a space - time @xmath40 is said to be a non - expanding horizon ( neh ) if it satisfies the following conditions :    \\(i ) @xmath39 is topologically @xmath41 and null ;    \\(ii ) the expansion @xmath42 of @xmath19 vanishes on @xmath39 , where @xmath19 is any null normal to @xmath39 ;    \\(iii ) all equations of motion hold at @xmath39 and , if any matter field are present with @xmath43 as the stress energy tensor , then we require @xmath44 to be future directed and causal for any future directed null normal @xmath45",
    ".    note that if condition ( ii ) holds for one null normal @xmath19 , then it holds for all .",
    "we will only consider those null normals which are nowhere vanishing and future directed .",
    "we are therefore allowed to rescale @xmath19 by any positive - definite function . the energy condition in ( iii )",
    "is implied e.g.  by the null energy condition which is commonly assumed ; for the remainder of this paper , we shall usually consider only vacuum spacetimes .",
    "comparing the properties of the world tube @xmath37 described earlier with conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) in the definition , we see that the neh is precisely what we need to model the physical situation at hand ; when the black hole is approximately isolated , the world tube @xmath37 represents a non - expanding - horizon @xmath39 .",
    "the motivation behind the conditions in the definition are thus rather straightforward from the perspective of apparent horizons .",
    "we have motivated the above definition using the world tube of apparent horizons which in general clearly depends on how we choose to foliate the spacetime with spatial surfaces .",
    "it is then natural to ask whether an neh depends on the choice of this foliation . to avoid unnecessary technicalities ,",
    "let us consider a possibly dynamical spacetime containing one isolated black hole . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", we can choose spatial hypersurfaces on which there are no apparent horizons so that the world tube of apparent horizons does not exist for this foliation .",
    "let us ignore this possibility and focus on the case when each spatial slice has exactly one marginally trapped surface and hence exactly one apparent horizon ; the generalization to multi black hole spacetimes is straightforward .",
    "it is not difficult to verify that the world tube of apparent horizons is independent of the spacelike hypersurfaces used to construct it .",
    "in other words , the null surface ( the neh ) obtained by stacking together all the apparent horizons at different times is independent of how we choose to foliate the spacetime by spacelike hypersurfaces ; this is not true in the regime when the horizon is non - isolated and the world tube is spacelike .",
    "an neh , even when viewed as the world tube of apparent horizons , is therefore an invariant notion in the four dimensional spacetime .",
    "every cross section of an neh is potentially an apparent horizon if it arises as the intersection of the neh with a spatial slice .",
    "choosing a different spatial slice corresponds to obtaining a different cross section of the neh . as we shall see later , for calculating physical quantities such as angular momentum and mass",
    ", it does not matter which cross section of the neh we choose to work with .",
    "even though cross sections of an neh are very closely related to apparent horizons , there are two differences : ( i ) apparent horizons are required to be the _ outermost _ surfaces on a spatial slice with the afore - mentioned properties",
    ". this may not be true in general for cross sections of @xmath39 ; ( ii ) since they are trapped surfaces , apparent horizons also satisfy the condition @xmath36 . though this will most likely be true in actual numerical simulations , it turns out that this condition is not required to study the mechanics of isolated horizons .",
    "in fact , there exist exact solutions representing black holes which are isolated horizons but do not satisfy @xmath36 , e.g. , the distorted black holes studied by geroch and hartle @xcite . in these solutions the integral of @xmath46 over a cross section of the horizon is still negative even though @xmath46 is not necessarily negative everywhere . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we shall ignore these caveats and the phrases ` apparent horizon ' and ` cross - section of @xmath39 ' will be used interchangeably .",
    "+ _ consequences of the definition : _ the simple definition of a neh leads to a surprisingly large number of consequences .",
    "the important results we shall need later are the existence of a one - form @xmath47 whose definition is given in equation ( [ eq : defomega ] ) , and the fact that the component @xmath48 of the weyl tensor is a physical , i.e.  gauge invariant , property of an isolated horizon .",
    "keeping these two results in mind , the rest of this sub - section may be skipped on a first reading .    while stating the results , it is convenient to use a null - tetrad @xmath49 which is _ adapted to the horizon _",
    "; this means that @xmath19 is a ( future directed ) null normal to @xmath39 .",
    "an example of such a null - tetrad is the one constructed in equations ( [ eq : normals ] ) and ( [ eq : mmbar ] ) , but there is , of course , an infinity of such tetrads .",
    "physical quantities will be independent of which null - tetrad we choose .",
    "these consequences do not require the spacetime to be vacuum ; they only assume the energy condition mentioned after the definition above .",
    "* _ area of apparent horizons is constant : _ any null normal @xmath19 is always geodetic and is also a symmetry of the degenerate intrinsic metric @xmath13 on @xmath39 : @xmath50 ( the symbol ` @xmath51 ' means that the equality holds only at points of @xmath39 ) .",
    "furthermore , the area of _ any _ cross - section @xmath16 defined as @xmath52 is the same where @xmath53 is the natural area measure on @xmath16 constructed from the two - metric @xmath13 . in particular , the area of the apparent horizons",
    "is constant in time . * _ definition of @xmath47 : _ it will be shown in section [ sec : trappinghor ] that the shear of @xmath19 defined as @xmath54 is zero .",
    "the twist of @xmath19 is trivially zero because @xmath19 is normal to a smooth surface , and the expansion of @xmath19 is zero by definition . since the null normal @xmath19 is expansion , twist and shear free , there must exist a one - form @xmath47 intrinsic to @xmath39 such that @xmath55 for any vector @xmath56 tangent to @xmath39 .",
    "if the null normal @xmath19 is rescaled @xmath57 , the one - form @xmath47 transforms as @xmath58 where ` @xmath59 ' is the exterior derivative on @xmath39 . * _ gauge invariance of @xmath48 : _ if we choose a null tetrad adapted to @xmath39 such as in equations ( [ eq : normals ] ) and ( [ eq : mmbar ] ) , then we get the following restrictions on the weyl tensor @xmath60 at @xmath39 @xcite : @xmath61 and @xmath62}\\,\\epsilon,\\ ] ] where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the area two - form on the apparent horizon .",
    "this can be used to prove the important result that @xmath48 is gauge invariant .",
    "the gauge freedom we are concerned with here is the choice of null tetrads adapted to @xmath39 .",
    "the allowed gauge transformations relating different choices are null rotations about @xmath19 : @xmath65 and spin - boost transformations : @xmath66 here @xmath4 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are arbitrary smooth functions on @xmath39 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath48 is always invariant under spin - boost transformations ; under null rotations , it transforms as ( see e.g.  the appendix of @xcite ) @xmath69 since @xmath70 and @xmath71 vanish at @xmath39 , we see that @xmath48 is in fact gauge invariant at the horizon : it does not depend on the choice of null tetrad as long as @xmath19 is one of the null generators of @xmath39 .",
    "this property is important because it tells us that the value of @xmath48 at the horizon does not depend on how we choose to foliate our spacetime .",
    "a different spatial slice @xmath72 will lead to a different @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the two null tetrads will be related by a combination of the following transformations : a null - rotation about @xmath19 , a spin - boost transformation , or a multiplication of @xmath76 by a phase . whichever null - tetrad we use to calculate @xmath48",
    ", we will get the same result . as we shall see , it is the imaginary part of @xmath48 which is physically interesting for our purposes .",
    "_ further definitions : _ the notion of non - expanding horizons describes the late time behavior of apparent horizons .",
    "in order to define the mass @xmath0 and angular momentum @xmath1 of @xmath39 , one needs to go beyond this definition and introduce additional structures on the horizon .",
    "this is done via the definition of a _ weakly isolated horizon _ @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian analysis which leads to the definitions of mass and angular momentum requires this extra structure .",
    "fortunately , it turns out that the _ formulae _ for @xmath0 and @xmath1 do not depend on this extra structure and hold true for non - expanding horizons .",
    "we could therefore omit these definitions entirely and simply state the results of the calculation .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we shall give the basic idea behind weakly isolated horizons .",
    "the rest of this sub - section may be skipped without loss of continuity .    in an neh ,",
    "the intrinsic metric @xmath13 is time independent since @xmath77 .",
    "there is no restriction on the time derivatives of the extrinsic curvature of @xmath39 or the intrinsic connection on @xmath39 ( by ` time derivative ' we mean derivative along @xmath19 ) .",
    "since @xmath39 is a null surface , there is no natural notion of extrinsic curvature .",
    "the closest thing to extrinsic curvature is the tensor @xmath78 defined via @xmath79 for any @xmath56 tangent to @xmath39 .",
    "this tensor is known in the mathematics literature as the weingarten map , and as its definition shows , it is @xmath80 with the covariant index pulled back to @xmath39 . from equation ( [ eq : defomega ] )",
    "we immediately obtain @xmath81 .",
    "this implies that requiring @xmath78 to be time independent is equivalent to requiring @xmath82 .",
    "unfortunately , due of the transformation property of @xmath47 ( see equation ( [ eq : transomega ] ) ) , it is clear that this equation is not meaningful if all rescalings of @xmath19 are allowed .",
    "note that if we restrict ourselves to rescalings that are constant on the horizon , then @xmath47 is invariant .",
    "we thus need to restrict ourselves to an equivalence class of null normals @xmath83 $ ] , the members of which are related to each other by a constant , positive non - zero rescaling .",
    "we can then associate a unique @xmath47 with @xmath83 $ ] .",
    "the equation @xmath82 is now perfectly meaningful if @xmath19 is a member of @xmath83 $ ] .",
    "a weakly isolated horizon is then defined as an neh @xmath39 equipped with such a preferred equivalence class of null normals @xmath83 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath47 associated with @xmath83 $ ] must be time independent : @xmath82 .",
    "given an neh , we can always find such a preferred equivalence class ( but this equivalence class is not unique ) .",
    "thus every neh can be turned into a weakly isolated horizon .",
    "the hamiltonian analysis of weakly isolated horizons leads to formulae for mass and angular momentum , and as we shall see in section [ eq : manda ] , these formulae are insensitive to arbitrary rescalings of @xmath19 and thus they make sense even for non - expanding horizons .",
    "we can introduce an even stronger definition .",
    "a weakly isolated horizon requires that @xmath47 be time independent .",
    "it can be seen from equation ( [ eq : defomega ] ) that @xmath47 is also a component of the intrinsic connection @xmath84 induced on @xmath39 by the four dimensional connection @xmath85 compatible with the four - metric .",
    "however , @xmath47 is just one component of @xmath84 . in an _ isolated horizon _ , we require that _ all _ components of @xmath84 are time independent .",
    "it turns out that generically , this condition gives us a preferred unique equivalence class @xmath83 $ ] @xcite .",
    "our strategy to find non - expanding horizons is to locate apparent horizons on each spatial slice and then to check whether the world tube @xmath37 obtained by stacking these horizons together is a neh . what remains to be checked",
    "is whether the tube is a null surface . by definition ,",
    "a surface is null if the metric @xmath86 induced on this surface has a degenerate direction , i.e.  if there exists a vector @xmath87 tangent to @xmath37 such that @xmath88 ; therefore , one possible method to check whether @xmath37 is isolated is to construct the induced metric @xmath86 on @xmath37 and see if it has a zero eigenvalue . to construct @xmath86 numerically",
    ", we have to know the two - metric @xmath13 on at least two different time slices .",
    "furthermore , in a numerical simulation , @xmath37 will never be exactly isolated because of numerical errors , and it is not clear how this method can quantify how close the horizon is to being exactly isolated .",
    "fortunately , there is a much simpler method which only requires the two - metric on a single time slice and can also provide a quantitative measure of how close @xmath37 is to being perfectly isolated .",
    "this method is based on the shear @xmath89 of @xmath19 , which is the symmetric trace - free part of the projection of @xmath90 onto the apparent horizon @xmath16 .",
    "the tensor @xmath89 has two independent components , and is conveniently written in terms of a single complex number @xmath91 , where @xmath76 is defined in equation ( [ eq : mmbar ] ) . to calculate @xmath92 conveniently , we simply decompose @xmath19 using equation ( [ eq : normals ] ) : @xmath93 in the above equation , we have extended the notation ` @xmath51 ' to also mean that the equality holds only at points of @xmath37 .",
    "the first term is just a component of the extrinsic curvature @xmath94 , while the second term can be calculated on the spatial slice by calculating the connection associated with the three - metric @xmath10 .",
    "we shall now prove the following important result concerning @xmath92 : + _ the world tube of apparent horizons is a neh if and only if @xmath95_. + readers not interested in the proof of this statement can skip forward to equation ( [ eq : sdef ] ) .    to prove this statement",
    ", we need to consider the general case when @xmath37 is not null .",
    "this has been studied in great detail by hayward @xcite . in hayward",
    "s terminology , the surface @xmath37 is essentially a _ future outer trapping horizon_. this means that @xmath37 is foliated by a family of marginally trapped surfaces ( which in our case are the apparent horizons ) satisfying the relations @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "these are physically very reasonable conditions , and all black holes found in simulations are expected to satisfy them .",
    "incidentally , note that the condition @xmath99 can be used to define , in a quasi local manner , what we mean by the inside and outside of the horizon .",
    "the proof of this statement , adapted from @xcite , is then quite simple : let @xmath100 be a vector tangent to @xmath37 and orthogonal to the foliation whose leaves are the apparent horizons .",
    "such a vector field may be considered to define time evolution at the horizon .",
    "it is easy to see that , up to a rescaling , @xmath100 can be expressed as a linear combination of @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a smooth function on @xmath37 .",
    "the rescaling freedom in @xmath103 will be inconsequential for our purposes .",
    "the surface @xmath37 is null , spacelike , or timelike if and only if @xmath102 is zero , positive , or negative respectively .",
    "we will now show that @xmath104 . from the definition of apparent horizons",
    "we know that the expansion @xmath105 vanishes everywhere on the horizon , therefore @xmath106 .",
    "this in turn gives @xmath107 even though @xmath108 and @xmath46 are so far defined only on @xmath37 , in equation ( [ eq : alpha ] ) ( and also in the very definition of a trapping horizon ) we are taking the derivatives of these quantities along @xmath19 and @xmath20 which are not necessarily tangent to @xmath37 .",
    "to make sense of this equation we need to extend @xmath19 and @xmath20 in a neighborhood of the surface @xmath16 .",
    "this can easily be done by using the unique geodesics determined by these vectors .",
    "the raychaudhuri equation for @xmath19 then leads to @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "if we assume that the spacetime is vacuum , then @xmath111 , and therefore @xmath112 , which along with equation ( [ eq : alpha ] ) gives @xmath113 this immediately implies that @xmath114 ( which is equivalent to @xmath37 being null ) if and only if @xmath115 .",
    "this is what we wanted to show .",
    "more generally , since @xmath116 , this shows that @xmath104 , which means that @xmath39 is spacelike when the shear is non - zero .    as a side remark",
    "we also show that @xmath37 is null if and only if the _ area element _ on the apparent horizons @xmath17 is preserved in time .",
    "to show this we need the equations @xmath117 it then follows that @xmath118 therefore @xmath114 if and only if @xmath119 , which is what we wanted to prove .",
    "this implies that if @xmath114 , then the area of cross - sections of @xmath39 is constant .",
    "however , the converse is not necessarily true , because @xmath17 could be changing in such a way that its integral is constant ; the area can be constant globally without being constant locally .",
    "thus , in principle , we can have situations in which the area is constant without the horizon being isolated .",
    "however , constancy of area is still a very useful first check to see when the horizon reaches equilibrium . finally , as a side remark we note that since @xmath104 and @xmath97 , we get @xmath120 , which is the area increase law .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in the case when @xmath92 vanishes ( up to numerical errors ) . in order",
    "for the horizon to be isolated we should have @xmath121 where @xmath53 is the natural area measure on @xmath16 constructed from @xmath13 .",

    "we have used equation ( [ eq : psi ] ) and an integration by parts .",
    "since @xmath48 is gauge invariant , so is the angular momentum , and in particular , it does not depend on the scaling of @xmath19 and it thus makes sense even on a neh . if , in a neighborhood of @xmath39 , there were a spacetime rotational killing vector @xmath131 that approached @xmath124 at @xmath39 , then the above formula for @xmath1 would be equal to the komar integral calculated for @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "however , the formula in equation ( [ eq : angmom ] ) is more general . as a practical matter , even if there were a killing vector in the neighborhood of @xmath39 , it is easier to use ( [ eq : angmom ] ) rather than the komar integral , since the komar integral requires finding the killing vector in the full four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that , if the vector field @xmath124 is not a symmetry of @xmath39 but is an arbitrary vector field tangent to @xmath16 , then @xmath132 is still the surface term at @xmath39 in the hamiltonian generating diffeomorphisms along vector fields which are equal to @xmath124 at the horizon . but",
    "in this case , there would be no reason to identify @xmath132 with the angular momentum , since conserved quantities such as mass and angular momentum are always associated with symmetries .",

    "we now describe a form of equation ( [ eq : angmom ] ) which is much better suited for calculating @xmath1 numerically . from equation ( [ eq : defomega ] ) , which is the defining equation for @xmath47 , we get @xmath133 where , as before , @xmath56 is any vector tangent to @xmath39 .",
    "assume that we have found the symmetry vector field @xmath124 on the horizon ( the method we use for finding @xmath124 is described below ) . from equation ( [ eq : angmom ] ) , we are eventually interested in calculating @xmath134 ; since @xmath124 is tangent to @xmath39 , setting @xmath135 we get @xmath136 where we have used equation ( [ eq : normals ] ) along with the fact that @xmath137 and @xmath138 are orthonormal . in the last step ,",
    "the definition of extrinsic curvature @xmath139 has been used where @xmath140 is the three - metric on the spatial slice @xmath8 .",
    "we have thus reduced the calculation of @xmath134 to finding a single component of the extrinsic curvature .",
    "the integration of this scalar over the apparent horizon yields the angular momentum : @xmath141 this is our final formula for the angular momentum .",
    "this formula is remarkably similar to the formula for the adm angular momentum computed at spatial infinity : @xmath142 the @xmath143 term does not contribute , because @xmath131 is tangent to @xmath144 , which is the sphere at spatial infinity .",
    "since the metric on @xmath144 is just the standard two - sphere metric , we have no difficulty in choosing a @xmath131 , and we can calculate @xmath145 about any axis .",
    "in contrast , since the metric on the apparent horizon @xmath16 is distorted , finding @xmath131 is more complicated .",
    "finally , as mentioned earlier , the similarity between equations ( [ eq : angmomk ] ) and ( [ eq : angmomadm ] ) is not surprising , because both quantities are defined to be surface terms in hamiltonians generating diffeomorphisms along the appropriate rotational symmetry vector fields ; @xmath1 is the surface term at @xmath39 while @xmath146 is the surface term at infinity .    given @xmath1 , the horizon mass @xmath0 is given by @xcite @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the area radius of the horizon : @xmath149 .",
    "this formula depends on @xmath148 and @xmath1 in the same way as in the kerr solution . however , this is a result of the calculation and not an assumption .",
    "the formulae for @xmath1 and @xmath0 are on the same footing as the formulae for the adm mass and angular momentum , because both are derived by hamiltonian methods . furthermore , under some physically reasonable assumptions on fields near future time - like infinity ( @xmath150 )",
    ", one can show that @xmath151 is equal to the energy radiated across future null - infinity if the isolated horizon extends all the way to @xmath150 .",

    "note that the method proposed in this paper has three advantages : ( i ) it is not tied to a particular geometry ( like the kerr geometry ) , ( ii ) it is completely coordinate independent , and ( iii ) it only requires data that is intrinsic to the apparent horizon .",

    "the following remarks are worth mentioning .",
    "even though our formula for @xmath0 is based on the corresponding kerr equation , much less use is made of the specific properties of a kerr black hole than in most conventional methods such as the great circle method described below .",
    "in particular , while deriving equation ( [ eq : mass ] ) , we do not make any assumption regarding the near horizon geometry .",
    "all that is required is that the members of the kerr family are elements of the phase space under consideration ( see @xcite for a detailed specification of the phase space ) .",
    "the kerr solutions are used only to provide a reference point for values of the black hole energy ; this is somewhat analogous to choosing the zero of a potential in classical particle mechanics . in principle",
    ", we could also have chosen a different two parameter family of solutions but we choose the kerr family due to its well known importance in black hole theory .",
    "owing to the uniqueness theorems of classical general relativity , it is commonly believed that a black hole that has been created in a violent event will radiate away all its higher multipole moments and settle down to form a kerr black hole near the horizon .",
    "one strategy for assigning a mass and an angular momentum to a black hole is then to identify the member of the kerr family one is dealing with and to read off the corresponding mass and angular momentum parameters .",
    "while this strategy is physically well motivated , and one does expect the final black hole to be close to kerr in some sense , we can refine this strategy considerably .",
    "the main difficulty with this method is that there are many subtleties and open questions regarding the issue of uniqueness of the final black hole . to briefly illustrate this point ,",
    "let us consider the isolated horizon describing the final black hole .",
    "the intrinsic geometry of the horizon is , by definition , time independent .",
    "however , it is not necessary that _ four dimensional _ quantities evaluated at the horizon must also be time independent .",
    "for instance , using the einstein equations at the isolated horizon , it turns out that the expansion and shear of the inward pointing normal @xmath32 ( see equation ( [ eq : normals ] ) ) may not be time independent ; these quantities decay exponentially @xcite .",
    "this means that the four - geometry in the vicinity of a neh is generically not time independent , and hence may not be isometric to a kerr solution .",
    "it is also not clear whether the four geometry tends to the kerr geometry as we approach future time like infinity .",
    "clearly , we need to prove a statement which says : ` sufficiently far ' into the future , the spacetime metric in a ` sufficiently small ' neighborhood of the horizon , is ` close to the kerr metric ' . in this statement ,",
    "each phrase within quotes is ill defined . to prove or disprove such statements ,",
    "it is imperative , at the very least , that one does not start with the assumption that the final black hole is kerr . in particular",
    ", it is desirable that we not use geometrical properties of the kerr horizon to calculate angular momentum and mass .",
    "if one nevertheless makes the assumption that the final black hole is described by a kerr geometry , one has to find a way to identify the particular member in the kerr family .",
    "the method that is most commonly used is the _ great circle method _ which is based on properties of the kerr horizon found by smarr @xcite .",
    "it can be described as follows :    in the usual coordinates , let @xmath245 be the proper length of the equator of the kerr apparent horizon and @xmath246 the proper length of a polar meridian . here",
    "the equator is the great circle of maximum length and a polar meridian is a great circle of minimum length .",
    "the distortion parameter @xmath247 is then defined to be @xmath248 .",
    "smarr then showed that the knowledge of @xmath247 , together with one other quantity like area , @xmath245 , or @xmath246 , is sufficient to find the parameters @xmath76 and @xmath221 of the kerr geometry .",
    "the difficulty with this method , apart from relying overly on properties of the kerr spacetime , is that notions such as great circles , equator or polar meridian etc .",
    "are all highly coordinate dependent .",
    "if we represent the familiar two - metric on the kerr horizon in different coordinates , the great circles in one coordinate system will not agree with great circles in the other system .",
    "the two coordinate systems will therefore give different answers for @xmath242 and @xmath221 as calculated by this method .",
    "in certain specific situations where one has a good intuition about the coordinate system being used and the physical situation being modelled , this method might be useful as a quick way of calculating angular momentum , but it is inadequate as a general method .    the problem of coordinate dependence can be dealt with in axisymmetric situations without assuming that the coordinate system used in the numerical code is adapted to the axial symmetry . the idea is to use the orbits of the killing vector as analogs of the lines of latitude on a metric two - sphere .",
    "the analog of the equator is then the orbit of the killing vector which has maximum proper length .",
    "this defines @xmath245 in an invariant way .",
    "the north and south poles are the points where the killing vector vanishes , and the analog of @xmath246 is the length of a geodesic joining these two points ( because of axial symmetry , all geodesics joining the poles will have the same length ) . since this geodesic is necessarily perpendicular to the killing vector",
    ", we just need to find the length of a curve which joins the north and south poles and is everywhere perpendicular to the killing orbits . with @xmath245 and @xmath246",
    "defined in this coordinate invariant way , we can follow the same procedure as in the great circle method to calculate the mass and angular momentum .",
    "this method can be called the _",
    "generalized _ great circle method .",
    "how does the generalized great circle method compare to our method ? from a purely practical point of view , note that this method requires us to find the killing vector , to determine the orbit of the killing vector with maximum length , and to calculate the length of a curve joining the poles which is orthogonal to the killing orbits .",
    "the first step is the same as in the isolated horizon method presented in this paper .",
    "while the next step in the isolated horizon method is simply to integrate a component of the extrinsic curvature on the horizon , this method requires more work , and furthermore , the numerical errors involved are at least as high as in the isolated horizon method .",
    "thus the simplicity of the great circle method is lost when we try to make it coordinate invariant , and it retains the disadvantage of relying heavily on the properties of the kerr geometry .",
    "it should also be mentioned here that there exist exact solutions to einstein s equations representing static , non - rotating and axisymmetric black holes .",
    "examples of such solutions are the distorted black hole solutions found by geroch and hartle @xcite or the solutions representing black holes immersed in electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the apparent horizons in all these solutions are distorted , and the generalized great circle method will give a non - zero value for the angular momentum . our method based on equations ( [ eq : angmomk ] ) and ( [ eq : angmom ] ) will give @xmath249 because the imaginary part of @xmath48 vanishes at the horizon for these solutions . while these solutions are probably not relevant for numerical simulations of binary black hole collisions , they represent physically interesting situations in which a black hole is surrounded by different kinds of external matter fields which distort the black hole ; these black holes may have some relevance astrophysically .",
    "these solutions show that the generalized great circle method can not be correct in general .",
    "they also illustrate that the great circle method will in general give results that are different from the ones obtained using komar integrals .    a completely different approach to finding",
    "the mass and angular momentum of a black hole in a numerical solution is to use the concept of a killing horizon . since in a numerical simulation",
    "one is interested in highly dynamical situations , one can not assume the existence of killing vectors in the whole spacetime .",
    "instead one assumes that stationary and axial killing vectors exist in a neighborhood of the horizon , and then uses appropriate komar integrals to find the mass and angular momentum .",
    "while this method is coordinate independent and does not rely on a specific metric , it has two disadvantages when compared with the isolated horizon approach .",
    "first , it is not a priori clear how the stationary killing vector is to be normalized if it is only known in a neighborhood of the horizon .",
    "secondly , this method requires the killing vectors to be known in a whole neighborhood of the horizon .",
    "computationally this is more expensive than finding a killing vector just on the horizon .",
    "conceptually it is also unclear how big this neighborhood of the horizon should be .",
    "furthermore , at present there is no hamiltonian framework available in which the boundary condition involves the existence of killing vectors in a finite neighborhood of the horizon . in a sense ,",
    "the isolated horizon framework extracts just the minimum amount of information from a killing horizon in order to carry out the hamiltonian analysis and define conserved quantities .",
    "one situation where the calculation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 might be useful is in studying properties of initial data .",
    "consider , for example , an initial data representing a binary black hole system . if the black holes are far apart , then we may consider them to be isolated ( this can be verified , for example , by calculating the shear of the inward null normal as in equation ( [ eq : sdef ] ) ) .",
    "then the difference @xmath250 represents the binding energy between the holes plus the energy due to radiation and possibly also the kinetic energy of the black holes . in order to find the individual black hole masses @xmath251 and @xmath252 equations ( [ eq : angmomk ] ) and ( [ eq : mass ] ) will be useful for this purpose .",
    "it is also interesting to compare different initial data sets which represent roughly the same physical situation by calculating the quantity @xmath253 .",
    "a lot of work in this direction has recently been carried out by pfeiffer et al .",
    "the isolated horizon framework may provide some further insights .",
    "the isolated horizon framework may also be used to construct initial data representing two ( or more ) black holes far away from each other .",
    "we want to specify the individual black hole spins , velocities and masses in the initial data when the two black holes are very far apart . for this purpose ,",
    "the formulae for @xmath1 and @xmath0 would be relevant , and we may assume that the black holes will be isolated at least for a short time and will form an isolated horizon .",
    "the isolated horizon conditions will then yield boundary conditions at the apparent horizon which can be used to solve the constraint equations on the spatial slice .",
    "in fact , pioneering work in this direction has already been carried out by cook @xcite ; the quasi - equilibrium boundary conditions developed by cook are identical to the isolated horizon boundary conditions in many ways .",
    "let us also briefly discuss one more important future application : extracting radiation waveforms .",
    "we expect that information about gravitational radiation will be encoded in a component of the weyl tensor such as @xmath254 where @xmath32 and @xmath255 are members of a null tetrad . in certain situations where we have a background metric or",
    "if we have killing vectors , there may be a natural choice of the null tetrad used to calculate @xmath256 .",
    "however , in general situations , it is not clear how to construct this preferred null tetrad . without a well defined way of calculating radiation waveforms",
    ", it is very hard to even compare the results of different simulations which model similar physical situations but in different coordinates .",
    "it turns out that the isolated horizon framework could be used to provide a preferred coordinate system in the vicinity of an isolated horizon . for this purpose ,",
    "we need more structure on the horizon than provided by a neh ; we need the notion of an _ isolated horizon _ as discussed briefly at the end of section [ sec : definitions ] .",
    "it can be shown that , generically , an isolated horizon has a preferred foliation which may be said to define its rest frame .",
    "in general , this preferred foliation will not agree with the foliation given by the apparent horizons in a particular choice of cauchy surfaces in spacetime .",
    "however , this preferred foliation can be constructed in a completely coordinate independent manner . given this preferred foliation",
    ", we can construct a coordinate system analogous to the bondi coordinates constructed near null infinity @xcite .",
    "this preferred coordinate provides an invariant way of calculating radiation waveforms and comparing the results of different simulations .",
