    "diffraction of electromagnetic waves by different bodies and screens is the subject of multiple studies @xcite .",
    "the most important theoretical results on diffraction by metal screens and apertures were reported by kirchhoff , bethe , and bouwkamp ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "recent research into electromagnetic wave transmission through an array of small holes @xcite has renewed the interest in electromagnetic wave diffraction @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that all the papers cited above considered the diffraction of electromagnetic waves by metal screens and apertures with time - constant dimensions .",
    "in this paper we present  to my knowledge  the first theoretical study of diffraction of electromagnetic waves by screens ( apertures in screens ) with time - varying dimensions and obtain the generalized vector kirchhoff representation for this case .",
    "such diffraction case may occur , e.g. , when the electromagnetic wave is incident on the aperture made in a metal screen by laser piercing , when the electromagnetic wave traverses the cylindrical metal shell collapsed under a z - pinch , or when a metal wire irradiated with the electromagnetic wave is exploded under the action of a power current pulse running across it .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : section 2 generalizes the scalar kirchhoff s integral representation to the case of screens and apertures with time - dependent dimensions .",
    "section 3 discusses wave diffraction by the screen s circular aperture with time - dependent radius .",

    "following @xcite , we shall begin the consideration from the diffraction of a scalar field , with @xmath6 denoting one of the electromagnetic - field components .",

    "this integral form of wave equation is known as the scalar kirchhoff s integral representation .",

    "but this change of the order of integration is valid only in the case when the volume @xmath2 and the surface @xmath3 are time - independent ! if @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the order of integration can not be changed .",

    "in contrast to a static case , in the discussed case of moving boundaries account should be taken of the fact that relativistic effects mix the fields @xmath139 and @xmath151 on the surface @xmath3 , making them dependent on the speed of the boundary motion .",

    "it is noteworthy that the additional terms can be divided into three groups .",
    "the first group includes the terms proportional to @xmath202 that only change the moduli of the fields .",
    "the second group comprises the terms proportional to the acceleration @xmath203 , and the third one contains the terms admixing the magnetic field to the electric ( or vice versa ) . despite the smallness of @xmath155 ,",
    "the third group of terms is fundamentally important when the electric field itself is induced by the motion of the conductor in the magnetic field ( i.e. , electromagnetic induction ) .    in this case , the expressions for @xmath204 and @xmath205 in ( [ e444 ] ) should be rewritten for a relativistic case .",

    "we will not write cumbersome expressions describing the contribution to the intensity and the angular distribution of radiation that comes from the additional terms , leaving their detailed consideration for specific cases of practical importance .",
