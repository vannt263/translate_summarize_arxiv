    "intra - body networks ( ibns ) promise to usher in dramatic improvements in personalized medicine , implant - based in - situ monitoring , controlled drug delivery , and activity based muscular / neuro stimulation , among others . in this paradigm ,",
    "micro - scale sensors and embedded actuators may communicate with each other for automatic , real time response , or the sensors transmit wirelessly to a remote monitoring entity that aggregates and monitors the signals generated within the body .",
    "moreover , the sensors may themselves be programmed with new instructions over time , such as activating specific bio - marker receptors for various patient conditions and medical check points .",
    "this closed loop system makes it possible for continuous monitoring without invasive techniques , reduces the delay and human - error in processing the data . as an example case study , diabetic patients frequently self - monitor blood glucose concentrations using small blood samples obtained through a finger prick , and then administer multiple injections of insulin each day or use an insulin pump . however , the insulin is often slow reacting , leading to the possibility of overdose , and the glucose level is only checked at specific intervals , such as after meals .",
    "we envisage that the ibn composed of implanted plasma glucose sensors , aided by our implant communication , will continuously sample the accurate glucose level and transmit the data to an embedded insulin pump .",
    "the latter will project the patient s glucose level based on current level and past history , and release trickle amounts of insulin , all without human intervention .",
    "in addition , specialists can also study the response of the person to the specific insulin type , program any adjustment in dosage , or alter the sensing duty cycle .",
    "this same scenario for rf based interstitial fluid glucose sensor , becomes resource heavy and environmental dependent extending to atleast six feet around the body .",
    "galvanic coupling setup on skin surface with multiple tissue layers ( a ) top view ( b ) lateral view , width=302 ]    for ibns , the retrieval of the sensors for battery replacement becomes impractical , requiring efforts on reducing energy consumption for data aggregation and communication .",
    "we shall demonstrate subsequently in this paper that over the air radio frequency ( ota - rf ) , inductive and ultrasonic @xcite form of intrabody communication consumes energy at a higher scale , as compared to our proposed approach .",
    "moreover , our choice of using _ galvanic coupling _ as method for transmitting electrical signals is also motivated by the high water content within the human body , which facilitates the propagation of low frequency waves . while ota - rf communication is well understood despite its high absorption level within the body , a unified analytical model for the channel gain for weak electrical signal propagation through various tissue layers",
    "remains in a nascent stage .",
    "the key contribution in this paper is formulating closed form channel gain expressions for ibn by first building a three dimensional multi - layered tissue equivalent circuit model .",
    "our analysis allows reproducibility of results , and is able to accurately predict the channel gain across the skin as well as across and through the inner body tissues . it can accommodate a variety of transmitter - receiver distances , electrode separations and dimensions , various depths of implant embeddings , choice of operating frequency , and tissue thicknesses .      in galvanic",
    "coupled communication , a pair of electrodes within a given ibn node couple a weak electric signal of around @xmath0 to the body tissue @xcite , which is first modulated by the sensor data .",
    "the induced field in the tissue is well below the permissible limit @xcite , and additional design considerations are further discussed in section [ sec : safety ] .",
    "majority of the induced current that is coupled to the body passes through the return path of transmitter ( represented by black arrow in fig.[fig : gc ] ) and a minor part ( illustrated by gray arrows ) propagates through the body .",
    "the difference in potential is detected by the electrode pair of a receiver node .",
    "the receiver demodulates the signal to receive the sensor data .",
    "note that there is no common ground required here , as in the case of capacitive coupling @xcite .",
    "a characteristic feature of galvanic coupled communication is that the signal has a dominant component propagating through the inner tissue layers , even when the transmitter is placed on the surface @xcite .",
    "thus , apart from being more energy efficient compared to ota - rf , the ibn communication also becomes less impacted by environmental noise .",
    "a carefully designed coupling apparatus with an optimized signal amplitude and frequency gives rise to a dominant signal component that can be guided to traverse through specific part of the body .",
    "thus , multiple concurrent transmissions along the same body becomes possible , leading to new challenges in interference - free operation .",
    "this behavior differs from ota - rf propagation , wherein other transceivers must be silenced owing to the broadcast nature of the medium .      for establishing communication links among the ibn nodes , the tissue channel needs to be analyzed for selecting optimal propagation characteristics in order to safely and reliably transfer information .",
    "our work on an analytic model for building a reliable human tissue communication channel is motivated by the fact that in - vivo tissue experiments are not always possible , commercially available phantoms do not accurately reflect the tissue heterogeneity , and electrical propagation characteristics over a wide frequency range .",
    "human body is composed of multi - layered tissues each with its own signal propagation characteristics .",
    "tissue impedance calculations should include this multi - layer phenomenon for accurate channel estimations .",
    "the state of the art has been mainly restricted to a single tissue communication such as on - surface ( i.e. , with the transmitter and receiver placed on the skin ) , with a limited investigation in muscle  @xcite , that analyzes only three directions of current flow .",
    "our model completely changes this analysis using practical assumptions of the tissue electrical properties , where four directions of current flow ( the additional direction involving current passing into lower / upper tissue layers ) is possible . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this comprehensive treatment of galvanic coupling - based channel model has not been derived before , and for successful communication between implanted sensors , it is essential for characterizing the transverse path from one tissue to another .    moreover , for a detailed analysis on the implant data link through tissues , the communication channels along tissues needs to be characterized individually as skin to skin ( s - s ) , skin to muscle ( s - m ) , muscle to skin ( m - s ) and muscle to muscle ( m - m ) paths , among others .",
    "the field distribution arising out of the galvanic coupled multi - layered inner tissue that includes the above mentioned intra - body scenarios needs further investigation , as no reproducible analytic model exists that has been verified through experiments .",
    "we summarize the main contributions of our work as follows :    * we derive a three dimensional multi - layered human forearm tissue equivalent circuit model ( tec ) for analyzing the communication channel through the surface and inner tissue - layers .",
    "our reproducible expression involves a large number of configurable parameters ( over 10 ) , which can comprehensively capture the various design intricacies of gc - ibn - based communication . *",
    "our theoretical approach is validated with previously conducted experiments for on - skin communication .",
    "interestingly , our model indicates a tighter match with previously obtained measurements , than what was possible using existing models .",
    "we also include additional validations through measurement studies conducted on porcine tissue . * for verifying the accuracy of the multi - tissue analysis",
    ", we construct a 3d model of the human forearm using finite element simulation .",
    "the simulator captures minute aspects of the signal propagation through the inner tissues .",
    "this allows the simulation to be used for quick analysis of future network designs for situations where intra - body testing is not immediately feasible .",
    "* we ensure that safety considerations are incorporated based on electric current distributions inside tissues , and we identify the ideal transmission frequency ranges that provide the best performance .",
    "* we analyze the model for various parameters like tissue thickness and electrode dimensions / separations and provide insights on suitable implant positions inside the tissues .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : related ] gives the related work .",
    "we formulate our analytical model based on a circuit equivalent construction for the human forearm in section  [ sec : model ] with the corresponding simulation model and safe signal generation conditions described in section  [ fem ] . the model verification and analysis of the model parameters",
    "are given in sections  [ results ] and  [ sec : sense ] , respectively .",
    "measurements based on porcine tissues are presented in section  [ sec : pig ] , and finally , section  [ conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "among the different techniques available for modeling the tissue electrical behavior , quasi - static approximations , @xcite , full wave numerical techniques such as finite difference time domain method ( fdtd ) , finite element analysis ( fea ) @xcite , and equivalent circuit analysis ( eca ) based modeling are the main approaches .",
    "the quasi - static field distribution analyses are computationally efficient .",
    "however , they only represent low frequency approximations to maxwell s equations and can not be relied on for high frequency applications .",
    "field analysis using fdtd and fea are flexible and accurate but require a great deal of time for computing , and find limited application in a rapid deployment of an ibn .",
    "the eca model offers a simple transfer function valid for a wide range of frequency , with the advantage of accurate and instantaneous gain computation making is feasible for ibn deployment for time - sensitive healthcare applications .",
    "however , most of the existing approaches @xcite consider single tissue layer with limited flexibility , which we aim to overcome in our proposed work .",
    "additionally , works that consider the multi - layer effect @xcite include only bidirectional signal propagation paths ( longitudinal and cross paths ) between transmitter and receiver .",
    "the direct path between the transmitter terminals that depends on the underlying tissue impedance is assumed to be measurable at the electrode attachment site @xcite , which limits its practicality .",
    "also , the transverse path from one tissue to other that depends on the tissue thickness is neglected .",
    "the tissue equivalent model needs to be asymmetric as opposed to the existing models to account for dissimilar dimensions , tissue heterogeneity , and non - identical electrode set - up at transmitter and receiver , which significantly complicates the analysis .",
    "we aim to build a tissue equivalent circuit ( tec ) model that should quickly provide an estimate of the channel gain based on the choices of input frequency , transmitter - receiver locations , distance and separation between their electrodes .",
    "our model uses some easily obtained physiological factors , such as dimensions and hydration levels .",
    "we specifically design the model for the human forearm , with the individual tissue impedance obtained from their electrical properties .",
    "the corresponding dimensions are average values for an adult male .",
    "we derive this model next using the frequency dependent electrical properties of tissues .      living tissue is composed of both movable charges and movement restricted dipoles .",
    "hence , it can be characterized as an imperfect dielectric medium .",
    "when an array of electricity conducting cells are excited by an external electrical signal , each cell activates its neighbor , enabling signal propagation through different paths dictated by the cell structure and the frequency of operation .",
    "low frequency signals can not penetrate the high impedance cell membrane , and so it takes the circuitous path through extra - cellular fluid . as opposed to this ,",
    "high frequency signals pass through intra - cellular fluid by penetrating the cell membrane .",
    "thus , the cell membrane gives a capacitance effect , allowing the passage of only high frequency components .    under @xmath1 ,",
    "the dimensions of human body and implants are small compared to the signal wavelength , and hence , we undertake the analysis using _ lumped elements_. using the frequency dependent electrical properties of live tissues ( conductivity @xmath2 and permittivity @xmath3 ) , a simple biological cell can be modeled with resistance @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( representing dissipation loss ) , and a capacitor @xmath6 ( representing the charge holding ability ) , connected as shown in fig.[fig:3d](b ) .",

    "we assume that the other tissue properties can be estimated without actual measurement such as tissue thickness approximation using body mass index ( bmi ) , bio - electrical impedance analysis or triceps skin fold thickness .",
    "[ 2-port ]          prior to the complete modeling of the forearm , the equivalent circuit of a single galvanic coupled tissue is calculated using four impedance . these impedance values are derived as follows , based on the four paths taken by an injected current .",
    "these are marked as p1 , p2 and p3 in fig.[fig:3d](a ) for a single tissue layer , and the fourth path from one tissue layer to a neighbor is shown as p4 in fig.[fig:3d](d ) .",

    "anisotropism can also be introduced into the model by assuming that the transverse impedance is larger than the longitudinal impedance @xcite .",

    "the s - m and m - s paths have channel gain higher than the s - s path but lower than the m - m path .",
    "the s - m path with the receiver placed in muscle has atleast 12 db more gain than the m - s path with the receiver on skin .",
    "as there are no published experimental data on the signal gain over the m - m , s - m @xmath135 m - s paths to our best knowledge , our studies are limited to comparison between the analytical and theoretical models we have derived in this work .",

    "@xmath136 * impact of operating frequency : * to identify the ideal range of the transmission frequency , we consider two factors : ( i ) frequency of the signals naturally generated by the human body , and ( ii ) signal loss caused by dissipation for a given frequency within the tissue .",
    "the electrical signals within the human body including neural impulses , ecg , and eeg signals operate at a frequency lower than @xmath139 , and therefore , we avoid the frequencies @xmath140 for intra - body communication .",
    "as the channel characteristics are frequency dependent , we need to identify the ideal operating frequency that reduces signal loss .",
    "the signals transmitted into the tissue results into two current components , i.e. , the conduction current and displacement current as given in ( [ eqn : j ] ) . at lower frequencies , the conduction current that is caused by the movement of charges is high .",
    "this enables energy detention inside the tissue , resulting in higher intensity at the receiver end . at higher frequencies above @xmath82 ,",
    "the conductivity remains constant and therefore the conduction current also remains fixed .",
    "however , due to increase in capacitance effect the displacement current grows larger with frequency .",
    "this ultimately results in signal dissipating from the body into the surrounding region , possibly causing interference externally , as well as limiting the energy incident on the receiver electrode .",
    "for instance , at @xmath81 , the h field in the surrounding the body is in the order of a few @xmath141 , extending to around @xmath117 at the exterior . on the other hand , at @xmath138 , the h field surrounding the body is higher by two orders of magnitude , extending to about @xmath142 feet away from the body ( refer fig.[fig : field ] ) .",
    "the signal spreading out of the body is considered wasted , as it can not reliably be detected at the embedded receiver .",
    "thus , the signal loss is minimized as long as the operating frequency is restricted in such a way that the conduction current dominates the displacement current .",
    "this is true when the relationship @xmath143 holds in all tissues , i.e. , when we limit the frequency lower than @xmath144 .",
    "thus , to ensure that the dissipation loss is at minimum , the maximum frequency of operation is set at @xmath82 .",
    "the model proposed in this paper uses different variables as network design parameters such as tissue thicknesses , transmitter - receiver separation , electrode dimensions , and terminal separations .",
    "a better understanding of the relationships between these parameters and the channel gain would help determining the placements of ibn nodes .",
    "for this purpose , we under take one - factor - at - a - time approach to study the influence of the key network parameters on channel gain in this section .",
    "one of the important parameters that determine channel gain is the thickness of each tissue layer . in this section",
    ", we investigate the impact of fat and muscle tissue thickness on the signal gain .",
    "as sensors are often placed either on the skin ( with non - invasive access ) or in the muscle ( best propagation characteristics ) , the intermediate fat tissue behavior and its thickness play a crucial role in determining the quantity of signal that transcends the tissue boundaries . for instance , the influence of tissue thickness as a parameter in transverse impedance @xmath36 of the model is given by        @xmath145    where @xmath146 denotes the change in tissue thickness from the average value considered in this paper .",
    "in general , fat acts as a barrier between skin and muscle tissues , allowing either tissue to retain the energy ( for @xmath147 ) or allowing more current to pass through ( for @xmath148 ) . for the channel gain results given in fig.[fig : ss ] and fig.[fig : mm ] , we considered an average value of forearm fat thickness as 7 mm . from the results of varying fat thickness in fig.[fig:5plot](b ) , it can be seen that for varying fat thickness from @xmath149 to @xmath150 with @xmath151 , @xmath152 at @xmath81 the m - m path shows no significant change in gain and performs better for all fat thicknesses assumed .",
    "the s - m path has a slight drop in gain by about 1 db illustrating that for any fat thickness , the dominant part of signal propagates through the muscle .",
    "the m - s path gain also drops with fat thickness when there is no signal leakage from muscle to skin for thick fat .",
    "the s - s path gain drops for fat thickness between @xmath97 and @xmath153 and then improves towards the thin fat values when there is minimal leakage to the layers beneath the skin",
    ".    we can conclude that for a thick fat layer , the receiver should be positioned in the same tissue layer as the transmitter for better channel gain . as",
    "signal leakage is non - negligible for any fat thickness , simultaneous communication on the skin and within the muscle can not coexist at the same frequency .",
    "thus for multiple pair of co - located sensors and actuators placed on the skin as well as implanted within the muscle to be active , a multi - access scheme is required . for covering longer distances , and if the bmi values indicate thick fat layer , the m - m path is preferable .",
    "we undertake a similar study for varying muscle thickness and the results are given in fig.[fig:5plot](c ) .",
    "the gains along all the four considered paths increases with muscle thickness . in m - m ,",
    "m - s and s - m paths , for @xmath154 increase in muscle thickness , the increase in gain is about @xmath155 while in s - s path , the gain increases by @xmath156 .",
    "thus , networks formed in thicker muscle tissue offer better channel gains and cover longer distances .",
    "the maximum possible transmitter - receiver separation distance @xmath157 that determines the quality of signal for communication is one of the primary factors in ibn design .",
    "transmitted signals suffer a natural attenuation with distance owing to the increasing longitudinal impedance , @xmath31 . using analytical model",
    ", the impact of variation in @xmath33 in the longitudinal and cross impedance ( fig.[fig : sense](a ) can be derived in terms of the network parameters considered in this section as , @xmath158 and @xmath159 the rate of change of @xmath31 with respect to the change in @xmath33 is inversely proportional to @xmath33 that reflects similar trend in the channel gain calculation as illustrated in fig.[fig:5plot](d ) . for an increase in @xmath33 from @xmath160 to @xmath115 ,",
    "the signal gain drops by around @xmath161 in s - s path , about @xmath123 in m - m path , and about @xmath162 in s - m / m - s paths .",
    "this analysis would help determine the single - hop distance in body network design .",
    "[ fig : sense](b ) illustrates variation in the electrode separation distance , @xmath28 of the transmitter and the receiver together .",
    "the effect of @xmath28 is prominent on the direct impedance @xmath25 as given by the following relation .",
    "[ fig : sense ]    the gain in all paths increases with @xmath28 as shown in fig.[fig:5plot](e ) . moving the electrodes far apart , such as for the separation achieved by positioning one electrode on the top surface and the other one on the bottom surface of the forearm",
    ", the gain dramatically increases to a maximum of @xmath164 .",
    "we observe similar trends when the separation distance is varied within muscle ( i.e. , the m - m case ) .",
    "for instance , by parting the electrodes from @xmath165 to @xmath115 , the increase in gain is about @xmath166 in s - s path , @xmath167 in m - m path , and @xmath168 in s - m and m - s paths for average fat width .",
    ".[tab : porksimilarity ] similarity in electrical properties of porcine ( p ) & human(h ) tissue [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     albeit there are similarities between the human and porcine tissue , there are few differences that affect the accuracy of the tec model .",
    "the porcine skin is relatively hairless and tightly attached to subcutaneous tissues .",
    "it is less vascular and also thicker .",
    "for instance , the stratum corneum of human skin is on average around @xmath169 in thickness while that of porcine is @xmath170 .",
    "similarly , the ph of porcine skin is @xmath171 and that of human skin is @xmath172 . to add to this , the conductivity of muscle and fat varies from animal to animal by @xmath173 and @xmath174 in the range of frequency used @xcite . also , the change in tissue properties over time caused by the variation in tissue hydration level and temperature @xcite as illustrated in table.[tab : tissue_change ] contributes to measurement uncertainties as discussed below .",
    "when the tissue sample is freshly obtained ( within @xmath175 ) , the s - s path offered @xmath176 more than the tec gain with dry skin ( refer table.[tab : tissue_change ] ) .",
    "this is likely due to the abrasion on skin , caused by the shaving process that helped reducing the skin impedance .",
    "the impedance was further reduced when the locations of electrode attachment were moistened . however , the same measurements when observed after a couple of hours indicated a fall of @xmath125 from the initial gain . moistening",
    "the skin helped recovering @xmath167 of gain compared with the dry tissue state .",
    "we obtained the average value of these measurements in each path and plotted them in fig.[fig : pigplot ] .",
    "there is a difference of @xmath177 between the analytical model and empirical results , which is likely contributed by the above mentioned uncertainties , the reasons highlighted in section.[results ] , and due to the structural damage caused by excision .",
    "ibns will lead to diverse health care applications that would benefit at health risk populations and patients at remote locations when the presence of a human caregiver or trained medical professional is not always possible .",
    "the ability to sense physiological changes within the body and take proactive monitoring steps will increase human longevity at reduced health care costs . as a first step towards the galvanic coupled ibn described in this paper , we derived , verified and validated the equivalent electrical circuit model for human tissues in characterizing the physical layer .",
    "we conducted extensive studies regarding the gain and phase - change in the transmitted signal under varying operating frequencies , tissue dimensions , sensor placements , electrode separation distances and dimensions , among others , to comprehensively characterize the body channel , while respecting permissible safe current limits .",
    "we found that a maximum of @xmath178 in channel gain could result from variation in tissue properties from person to person .",
    "we identified the optimal frequency to lie between @xmath81 to @xmath82 for both on skin and in muscle paths , and determined that placing both the sender and receiver sensors within the muscle offered better channel propagation characteristics , as opposed to on the skin .",
    "we will investigate future topics in wireless communication , including derivation of achievable capacity and optimal modulation schemes , along with higher layer protocol design using the channel models derived in this paper .",
