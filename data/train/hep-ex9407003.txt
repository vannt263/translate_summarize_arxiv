    "in the hope of obtaining new insights into the old problem of soft interactions in high energy physics , there has been much interest in multiparticle correlations in the last few years , spurred by new theoretical perspectives and a large amount of multiparticle data in hadronic and nuclear collisions @xcite .",
    "while various monte carlo codes and analytical models often yield very similar behavior in rapidity and @xmath0 distributions , they predict widely differing particle correlations .",
    "experimentally measured correlations are therefore becoming an important and severe test of such theoretical models .",
    "experience has shown , however , that correlation measurements require considerably more subtle and sophisticated understanding of statistics than single - particle quantities do , and there has been much improvisation in methodology and interpretation of data .",
    "a clean and consistent statistical basis for such methodology has become a matter of urgency .",
    "recently , we have shown how , through the use of the correlation integral , the measurement of multiparticle correlations can be greatly improved , both in conventional variables such as rapidity and azimuthal angle @xcite and in terms of relative momenta used in pion interferometry @xcite . by deriving all quantities from first principles , our techniques , besides greatly improving the accuracy of correlation measurements , permit for the first time the direct measurement of cumulants .",
    "moments , while easily measured , contain lower - order correlations .",
    "cumulants , testing the actual correlations , are to be preferred , but they are hard to implement for at least two reasons : they contain a hidden statistical bias and are expensive in terms of cpu time .",
    "the mentioned bias is present in _ all _ correlation measurements ; it is large for small data samples and strong correlations while becoming negligible for large samples and weak correlations .",
    "our analysis provides the framework for understanding and dealing with this bias in any present or future data set .",
    "secondly , correlation integral algorithms , while much superior to conventional methods , run at least as the square of the event multiplicity and the sample size @xmath1 . in understanding",
    "this bias , we point the way to huge reductions in computer time also . defining for inner",
    "event averages a `` reduced sample average '' containing only @xmath2 events , and correcting for the resulting bias , we obtain , compared to full event mixing , savings of a factor @xmath3 for the star integral . for a typical case with @xmath4 events and @xmath5 , the savings amount to a factor @xmath6 over full event mixing .    besides the bias under discussion , there clearly are other biases , both statistical and systematic , which greatly influence multiparticle correlations .",
    "typical unwanted but often important effects include the `` empty bin effect '' @xcite and contamination by trivial sources of particle correlations such as dalitz decays and gamma conversion @xcite or the misidentification of pieces of a single track as two ( highly correlated ) particles @xcite .",
    "all these have been shown to be capable of drowning other correlations in the background . eliminating such biases",
    "is therefore a _ sine qua non _ of multiparticle correlations .",
    "we take here a simple model of such correlations , the split track model @xcite , to illustrate both the use of the reduced event average with bias correction and the effect such contamination may have on correlation data .    in section [ sec : uprod ] , we first explain the use and significance of unbiased estimators and find a general form for unbiased estimators of products of densities .",
    "we develop the general formalism in section [ sec : corterms ] and apply these in section [ sec : starc ] to the star integrals .",
    "an example of behavior of the star integral as applied to the split track model is given in section [ sec : splt ] , followed by an outline of steps needed to measure unbiased correlations in truly small samples and a brief discussion of corrections for other correlation methods .",
    "we conclude with some comments on small samples and single - event measurements .",
    "first results regarding unbiased estimators can be found in ref .",
    "more recently , this formalism has been applied to the problem of normalization in a fixed - bin context @xcite .",
    "we briefly remind the reader of some basics of statistical theory .",
    "suppose we have a random variable @xmath7 which for a given trial ( or `` event '' in the parlance of high energy physics ) takes on a value @xmath8 .",
    "for a finite number of events @xmath1 , the set of values of @xmath8 make up a _ sample _ , for which the _ sample average _ of @xmath7 can be found , @xmath9 . by carrying out an infinite number of trials ( the _ population _ ) , one can theoretically determine the `` true '' behavior @xmath10 of the random variable .",

    "@xmath11 $ ] of a quantity @xmath7 is the value found over an infinite number of trials , @xmath12 = \\lim _ {   n_{\\rm ev}\\to\\infty }                   \\sum_{e=1}^{n_{\\rm ev } } \\hat u_e / n_{\\rm ev } \\,.\\ ] ] an experimental sample invariably consists of a finite number of events , so that @xmath11 $ ] can not be found directly .",
    "a large part of statistics occupies itself with the question how the information contained in a limited sample can be extrapolated to estimate its true behavior over the whole population . rather than taking the limit @xmath13",
    ", one imagines that there are @xmath14 samples , each with @xmath1 events and a particular value of @xmath15 for each .",
    "these sample averages themselves form a distribution , the _ sampling distribution_. for infinite @xmath1 , the sampling distribution of course narrows to a delta function centered on @xmath10 , but for finite @xmath1 the sampling distribution has a nonzero width independent of the number of samples @xmath16 .",
    "there is no way to ascertain where the @xmath15 obtained for _ one _ experimental sample will fall in this distribution , i.e.  one can never claim with certainty that @xmath17 .",
    "all that can be achieved is to make sure that , even for finite @xmath1 , the _ sampling average _ of the sampling distribution @xmath18 equals the true value @xmath10 .",
    "surprisingly , this is not generally true : for finite @xmath1 , @xmath19 is not necessarily equal to @xmath10 . when it is not , @xmath7 is termed a _ biased estimator _ of @xmath10 , and one attempts to find a corresponding _ unbiased estimator _",
    "@xmath20 which does fulfil the condition @xmath21 note : here and throughout this paper , we use the shortened notation @xmath20 to denote the unbiased estimator _ for _ the true value @xmath22 , i.e.  the @xmath22 inside the brackets is not the argument of @xmath23 but the _ desired result_. the set of @xmath24 of the experimental sample make up the arguments of @xmath23 , which in full notation should be written as @xmath25 .",
    "for the case of multiparticle physics , the basic random variables @xmath7 correspond to the one - particle inclusive density of event @xmath23 , @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the set of measured coordinates of the @xmath28 particles of the event , and the corresponding @xmath29-th order densities for the event @xmath23 , @xmath30 these yield the sample average @xmath31 , identified with the usual experimental inclusive density @xmath32 which is normalized to the factorial moment of the event multiplicity @xmath28 , @xmath33}\\rangle               = \\langle n(n-1)\\cdots(n - q+1 ) \\rangle$ ] .",
    "it has long been known that the inclusive density is an unbiased estimator for the true value , @xmath34 , and so little attention has been paid to the theory of estimators in high energy physics . unlike a single inclusive density , however , a product of two or more densities is a biased estimator .",
    "this we illustrate for the simple example of the product of two single - particle densities @xmath35 before considering the general case .",
    "the sampling average of @xmath36 is @xmath37 i.e.  there are @xmath1 out of the total @xmath38 terms in which the two @xmath39 s refer to the same event and thus effectively introduce a correlation .",
    "because the densities of different events are independent , the sampling average of their product factorizes , yielding the true inclusive densities , can be written as the sampling average of either the sample - averaged density or of the single - event density , @xmath40 , because eq .  ( [ esac ] ) is valid for single - event `` samples '' @xmath41 also . ]",
    "@xmath42 so that @xmath43 meaning that @xmath44 is not equal to @xmath45 and thus @xmath36 is a biased estimator for the latter .",
    "the culprit is clearly the equal - event part in eq .",

    "this equation is the most important point of our paper . in the following sections , we explore the consequences for various correlation measurements of taking only unequal events in products of densities .",
    "products such as in eq .",
    "( [ esm ] ) can be written in terms of event mixing , a procedure used heuristically before to normalize correlation measurements . from here on , we distinguish three different kinds of event mixing : denoting the first event average by the index @xmath54 and subsequent averages by @xmath55 , _ full event mixing _ is given by running all indices over the full sample with @xmath1 terms , @xmath56 the _ reduced event average _ runs the inner event averages over @xmath2 events only , @xmath57 while _ fake event mixing _ selects randomly a track from each of @xmath28 different events ( where @xmath28 itself must follow a poisson distribution ) and does the standard analysis on a sample of such fake events @xcite . while full event mixing is exact , it is feasible only for small samples , so that in practice the reduced average or fake event procedures are chosen .",
    "the latter is easy to understand and implement for the normalization @xmath58 , but hard to implement for the cumulant expansions introduced below .",
    "we shall concentrate therefore on using the reduced event average .",
    "before going into the details of unbiased estimators for the various correlation measurements in current use , we establish the general framework for these corrections which will be applicable for all occurrences of products of random variables . to simplify notation , we write for the single - event inclusive densities @xmath59 the variables @xmath60 and @xmath61 the sample averages ; the desired true values are @xmath62 etc .",
    "as in section [ sec : uprod ] , the desired unbiased estimator for a given product is obtained when the single factors come from different events , as then the sampling average factorizes , @xmath63 and , to make full use of all events in the sample , the sums over all ( unequal ) events are introduced .",
    "products of experimentally measured inclusive densities , on the other hand , have unrestricted sums , so that it is necessary to expand the unequal - event sums in terms of unrestricted ones .",

    "as expected , the unbiased @xmath162 and @xmath163 are zero to within statistical errors , while the biased @xmath162 and @xmath163 rise strongly .",
    "the rise is due entirely to the equal - event bias which is the subject of this paper . @xmath164 and @xmath165 contain contributions from second- and third - order correlations @xcite and therefore are not zero .",
    "note also that the biased estimate lies _ below _ the unbiased one for the moments , while for the cumulants , it lies _ above _ the unbiased estimator .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath158 are corrected only through the normalization @xmath98 , which in eqs .",

    "the most important feature is that only the data point corresponding to the smallest @xmath88 contains the split track contributions to @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "this must be so because all three particles belonging to a given cluster are by construction separated by zero distance .",
    "secondly , the difference between biased and unbiased differentials is much smaller than for the corresponding integral quantities @xmath158 and @xmath150 .",
    "this is because in eqs .",

    "it may be tempting to use a large value @xmath2 for inner event averages while neglecting bias corrections rather than implementing them . that this is usually not helpful is shown by figure 3 , where we have plotted the dependence of the ( biased , uncorrected ) @xmath163 on the number of events",
    "@xmath2 taken for the inner event average .",
    "again , the `` true '' value is @xmath171 .",
    "clearly , the resulting curves converge rather slowly to zero even for large @xmath2 .",
    "the unbiased @xmath163 , however , are virtually indistinguishable for all values of @xmath2 shown here , meaning that , for the present parameters , even the smallest value @xmath157 is sufficient to obtain good results if the bias corrections are implemented .",
    "the factor 10 in cpu time needed for the @xmath172 case shown is thus largely wasted .",
    "the only remaining advantage of using a larger @xmath2 is that statistical errors become smaller ( but the mean value remains the same ) .",
    "the curves shown here are for the one - dimensional model ; for higher dimensions , the effect of split tracks on the correlation is much larger since the rise of the cumulants goes roughly like @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the dimension of the phase space .    at this point",
    "we also comment on the use of different random number generators . as can be seen in figures 13 , the fifth order cumulant @xmath163 and differential @xmath175",
    "show some deviation from the theoretical value of zero for small @xmath88 .",
    "we have tested various available random number generators with the split track model , using exactly the same parameters quoted above .",
    "it turns out that the different generators produce substantially different results for @xmath163 at small @xmath88 , with some deviating above zero , others below , with varying sizes of error bars .",
    "the calculation of cumulants in the split track model is clearly a _ very _ sensitive test of the quality of a random number generator , just as it has proven itself in ferreting out statistical and systematic experimental biases .",
    "a really good random number generator should yield results for @xmath163 within the split track model which are compatible with zero .",
    "we therefore recommend that , before any experimental measurements of correlations are attempted and compared to so - called `` random '' number data , _ all _ random number generators first be tested whether they produce truly zero cumulants of higher orders . only when they do can any further conclusions as to correlations in the data be drawn .",
    "when the number of events in the experimental sample becomes very small , of the order of 100 or less , full event mixing may become unavoidable . in this case , of course , it becomes mandatory to avoid the equal - event bias , otherwise the measurement is simply wrong . because for small samples cpu time is not an issue , the best and most transparent method is directly to implement the full unequal - event estimator of eq .",
    "( [ esm ] ) for all products in cumulants and normalization .",
    "if for higher @xmath29 it does become advantageous to avoid direct implementation of unequal - event algorithms , our procedures can be used in modified form as follows .    whereas the above bias corrections assumed that events @xmath176 were always unequal to the `` outer '' event @xmath54 , full event mixing must allow and correct for all possible combinations of equal and unequal events . therefore , the simple procedure of using the expansions of @xmath177 in terms @xmath178 etc .  of section [ sec : corterms ] can not be applied directly ;",
    "rather , one must start from first principles and apply the sum combinatorics to _ all _ sums .",

    "the inherent instability and large error bars found for these moments and cumulants , however , make it doubtful that these corrections will make a discernible difference .",
    "the statistical bias arising through the need for multiple event averages must be understood and corrected for .",
    "we have shown how the theory of unbiased estimators leads to correction formulas for the star integral , thereby making it possible to run it under fast algorithms without loss in accuracy .",
    "for the envisaged large data samples , this savings in cpu time may prove the difference between viability and impossibility of correlation measurements in future .",
    "for truly small samples , the correction for this bias is not a tool for faster analysis but constitutive for a correct measurement .",
    "typical small samples are found in cosmic ray data and in galaxy correlations as well as the subdivision of inclusive data samples into fixed - multiplicity subsamples .",
    "all these must take cognizance of the bias and correct for it .",
    "this brings us to the subject of single - event measurements : event mixing is , of course , not possible when there is just one available . for the proposed measurement of bose - einstein correlations in single events in nuclear collisions at rhic and lhc ,",
    "the solution is clearly to normalize by event mixing based on a sample of similar events .",
    "most notably , this mixing sample should have the same multiplicity and general characteristics ; such requirements will necessarily restrict the sample to relatively few events , so that the bias corrections may become important .",
    "galaxy distributions , on the other hand , present a much more difficult task : there is no pool of big bang events to make up the uncorrelated background .",
    "so far , the preferred solution was to assume a uniform distribution on a sufficiently large scale .",
    "recent results on the large - scale structure of the universe , however , make this assumption increasingly untenable .",
    "the only alternative route would appear to be to select a number of windows in the sky ( with about the same overall galaxy count as the window used for the numerator ) and , neglecting the long - range correlations , count these as different `` events '' . in this way",
