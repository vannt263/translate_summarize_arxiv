    "the existence of a 125 gev higgs boson has been recently confirmed by the atlas and cms collaborations at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the next main step of the lhc searches is to discover new particles beyond the sm .",
    "as one of the most theoretically well - motivated scenarios for new physics , the minimal supersymmetric standard model(mssm ) have been widely studied by the theorists and experimentalists . however , up to now , the lhc has not found any evidences of the susy particles(sparticles ) .",
    "the negative results of direct searches for sparticles have pushed up the mass limits of the first two generation squarks and gluino into tev region @xcite .",
    "the third generation squarks and non - colored sparticles have also been constrained in the simplified models @xcite .",
    "but they are still allowed to be at hundred gev and may live in some hidden corners , due to their complicated decay modes @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the direct searches , an advantage of indirect searches lies in the fact that the results weakly depend on the kinematics configurations of sparticles . in this case , an alternative way is to find the indirect susy signals via loop corrections by the high precise measurements of the newly discovered higgs boson at a higgs factory . among several proposals for the higgs factories ,",
    "the circular @xmath4 colliders have been widely investigated , such as the tlep @xcite .",
    "the proposed tlep @xmath4 collider @xcite could be located in a new 80 to 100 km tunnel in the geneva area .",
    "it would be able to produce collisions at 4 interaction points with centre - of - mass energies from 90 to 350 gev and beyond and is expected to make precision measurements at the @xmath5 pole , at the @xmath6 threshold , at the @xmath7 cross section maximum , and at the @xmath8 threshold , with an unprecedented accuracy . as comparison with other linear @xmath4 collider , such as ilc and clic , the luminosity expected at tlep is between a factor 5 and 3 orders of magnitude larger than that expected for a linear collider , at all centre - of - mass energies from the @xmath5 pole to the @xmath8 threshold , where precision measurements are to be made , hence where the accumulated statistics will be a key feature . according to the expected high performance of the tlep @xcite , about @xmath9 higgs bosons",
    "can be produced per year through the higgs bremsstrahlung process at @xmath10 gev with an integrated luminosity of 10000 fb@xmath11@xcite , which allows to measure the higgs boson couplings at a percent level @xcite .",
    "in addition to these studies , the tlep also provides a unique opportunity to examine the various higgs boson rare productions and decays .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the associated production of the sm - like higgs boson ( @xmath12 ) with a hard photon in the mssm at the tlep under the current experimental constraints .",
    "since the process @xmath13 occurs at loop level , it will be sensitive to the contributions from the new particles .",
    "such a process has been studied some time ago in refs.@xcite and recently studied in ref.@xcite for ( un)polarized electron and positron beams .",
    "since the leading order of @xmath14 occurs at one - loop level induced by the electroweak coupling , the cross section is rather small , but the signal is very clean at a @xmath4 collider .",
    "this allows for a reasonable hope to observe these events @xcite if enough data is collected at a future high - energy collider .",
    "given the expected high luminosity @xmath15 fb@xmath11 , there can be about 2,000 events to be obtained at the tlep with @xmath16 gev .",
    "so we can expected that the tlep may have a promising potential to detect the process @xmath14 .",
    "but of course , the final feasibility study will depend on the future detector and analysis performance of the tlep , which is beyond the scope of this work .    on the other hand , due to the recent constraints on the parameter space of the mssm from the lhc experiments and the dark matter detections ,",
    "it is necessary to reevaluate the size of the susy corrections to @xmath14 in the allowed parameter space . besides",
    ", the process @xmath13 can be used to probe the anomalous couplings of @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite . at the lhc , most measurements of the properties of the higgs boson are consistent with the sm expectations @xcite . however , the signal strength of diphoton decay mode reported by atlas is considerably larger than the sm prediction @xcite , and this excess may persist in the future . in the mssm , @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    "can be simultaneously enhanced by a light stau with the large @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite , which will also lead to a significant enhancement in the process @xmath13 . meanwhile , both atlas and cms experiments have projected their sensitivities to high luminosities under various assumptions of detector and analysis performance in ref.@xcite . for rare decays",
    "@xmath21 , since the signal - background ratios is only about 0.5% , the expected relative precisions on the signal strengths of @xmath21 at best reach about 20% at 14 tev lhc with @xmath22 fb@xmath11 . however , according to the study of the ref.@xcite , the production rate of @xmath23 in the mssm at the lhc just is 1.1 times the sm prediction .",
    "so , it is very challenging for the hl - lhc to observe such indirect mssm effects in the rare decay @xmath21 . on the other hand ,",
    "since there is no available studies of the expected ilc measurement of @xmath21 , we can only estimate @xmath21 by referring to the ilc accuracy of @xmath24 .",
    "at the ilc , the fast simulation studies indicate that @xmath25 can be measured with an accuracy of 34% using @xmath26 at @xmath27 gev with a luminosity 250 fb@xmath11 @xcite . in the sm",
    ", the branching ratio of @xmath21 is about 1.5 times smaller than @xmath17 for @xmath28 gev .",
    "this means the events number of @xmath21 collected by the ilc will be only about 2/3 of @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , the multiplicity of final states in @xmath29 may reduce the reconstruction efficiency as comparison with @xmath17 .",
    "so we can infer that the 250 gev ilc accuracy for @xmath21 at most reach @xmath30 as the same as @xmath17 , which is expected to be improved to 8.5% for a luminosity 1000 fb@xmath11 at @xmath31 gev @xcite . in this case",
    ", a super - high luminosity higgs factory , such as tlep , may be needed to detect the indirect mssm effects in @xmath21 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "we briefly describe the scan of the parameter space of the mssm and the calculations for the process @xmath14 . in sec.iii",
    "we present the numerical results and discussions . finally , we draw the conclusions in sec",
    "in this work , we will aim to examine the enhancement effects in @xmath14 and its correlation with the lhc signal strengths @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the mssm . given the previous results , we focus on the light stau scenario of mssm , where the loop induced couplings @xmath1 and @xmath2 are found to be enhanced .",
    "note that such a scenario is different from the natural mssm with a light stop and light higgsinos .",
    "the latter one can be probed by searches for stop pair production @xcite or mono - jet signals induced by the degenerate higgsinos @xcite . while for our scenario ,",
    "the direct searches for the light stau pair production or precise measurement of the rare higgs decay @xmath17 can be used to test it at the lhc @xcite . in the mssm , after the electroweak symmetry breaking , there are two cp - even higgs bosons(@xmath35 ) , one cp - odd higgs boson(@xmath36 ) and the charged higgs bosons(@xmath37 ) .",
    "although the mass of the lighter cp - even higgs boson ( @xmath38 ) is smaller than @xmath39 at tree level , it can receive the large radiative corrections from the stop sector at one - loop level .",
    "the leading part of the corrections from the stop sector can be expressed as @xcite @xmath40\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the mixing parameter of stop . to increase @xmath38 to 125 gev",
    ", it needs the heavy stop masses or a sizable stop mixing parameter @xmath42 . in our study",
    ", we calculate the higgs mass by using the package @xcite and impose the collider constraints on the mssm higgs sector by using the package @xcite . in order to get the parameter space of the mssm allowed by the current experiments , we scan the following parameter spcae : @xmath43    we fix the first two generation squark soft masses(@xmath44 ) and gluino mass(@xmath45 ) at 2 tev , and set @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "we take the grand unification relation @xmath48 for electroweak gaugino masses .",
    "since the first two generation sleptons are irrelevant to our study , we decouple them for simplicity . according to ref.@xcite",
    ", we take @xmath49 in our calculations .",
    "the reason is that the enhancement of @xmath50 is sensitive to the stau mass and @xmath51 .",
    "so without large @xmath52 , one can also have a light stau by setting the relevant soft mass @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    in the scan , we consider the following experimental and theoretical constraints :    1 .",
    "we require that the mass of the light cp - even higgs for each samples be in the region of 123 gev@xmath55 127 gev @xcite .",
    "at the same time , the current bounds for the higgs bosons from lep , tevatron and lhc should be satisfied @xcite ; 2 .",
    "we require our samples to satisfy the b - physics bounds at 2@xmath56 level , including @xmath57 and the latest measurements of @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we use the package of @xcite to implement these constraints ; 3 .   by using the package of @xcite",
    ", we impose the dark matter constraints of the neutralino relic density from planck(in 2@xmath56 range ) @xcite and the direct detection results from lux ( at 90% confidence level ) @xcite ; 4 .",
    "since the large mixing terms in the stau sector will jeopardize the vacuum stability in the mssm @xcite , our samples are required to comply with the vacuum meta - stability condition by using the formula in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath61    we mainly use the flat scan method to obtain the samples that satisfy our constraints . but according to the previous studies @xcite , we extra generate more random points in the region with large @xmath51 and light stau to obtain the loop induced coupling @xmath1 and @xmath2 as large as possible .",
    "such method can successfully cover most of the parameter space that relevant for our study , which has also been used in our group work @xcite and been cross checked by other group @xcite .",
    "after our scan , we obtain 1078 samples allowed by the listed constraints ( 1)-(4 ) in the above .",
    "the values of @xmath62 for these samples are larger than about @xmath63 gev .",
    "since there is still a large discrepancy between the sm prediction and experimental results @xcite , we do not require our samples to explain the anomalous muon @xmath64 in our calculations .",
    "but it should be mentioned that the large @xmath51 will be helpful for alleviating this tension in the mssm .    in the mssm ,",
    "the process @xmath0 includes the following subprocesses : @xmath65 @xmath66channel : @xmath67 vertex diagrams that are corrected by the charged higgs boson , chargino , squark and slepton ; @xmath68 @xmath69channel : @xmath70 vertex diagrams that are corrected by chargino / sneutrino and neutralino / selectron ; @xmath71 box diagrams that involve neutralino / selectron and chargino / sneutrino states .",
    "we denote the four - momenta of initial and final states in the process as @xmath72 all the amplitudes of eq.([eehr ] ) are generated by @xcite , and are further reduced by @xcite .",
    "the numerical calculations are performed by using @xcite . in order to preserve supersymmetry , we adopt the constrained differential renormalization ( cdr ) @xcite to regulate the ultraviolet divergence ( uv ) in the virtual corrections , which is equivalent to the dimensional reduction method at one - loop level @xcite .",
    "we numerically checked the uv cancellation and notice that the @xmath73 self - energy mixing term is required to get the finite results .",
    "note that the infrared singularities may occur in the @xmath74channel @xmath70 vertex and @xmath75 box diagrams .",
    "however , since we keep the electron mass in the loop functions , infrared singularities that appear as logarithmic singularities @xmath76 can cancel exactly when all these diagrams are summed . we also checked our results with those of ref .",
    "@xcite by setting the same sm parameters and found they are consistent well . in order to show the susy effects in the process",
    "@xmath77 , we define the following ratio : @xmath78",
    "on the lighter stop mass(@xmath79 ) , the lighter stau mass(@xmath80 ) and @xmath81 at the tlep with @xmath82 gev.,title=\"fig:\",width=226,height=188 ]   on the lighter stop mass(@xmath79 ) , the lighter stau mass(@xmath80 ) and @xmath81 at the tlep with @xmath82 gev.,title=\"fig:\",width=226,height=188 ]   on the lighter stop mass(@xmath79 ) , the lighter stau mass(@xmath80 ) and @xmath81 at the tlep with @xmath82 gev.,title=\"fig:\",width=226,height=188 ]   on the lighter stop mass(@xmath79 ) , the lighter stau mass(@xmath80 ) and @xmath81 at the tlep with @xmath82 gev.,title=\"fig:\",width=226,height=188 ]    in our numerical calculations , we take the input parameters of the sm as @xcite @xmath83 we keep the same higgs mass for the calculation of @xmath14 in the sm and mssm . in addition , since we use the loop - corrected higgs mass in the phase space , we should also correct all involved higgs couplings in order to get the sm result of @xmath14 in the decoupling limit .",
    "such calculations can be done by correcting the mixing angle @xmath84 and the cp - even higgs masses @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the only one exception is the trilinear couplings of the cp - even higgs boson couplings to charged higgs bosons and goldstones that could not be completely mapped into the corrections to the angle @xmath84 .",
    "we correct these couplings as the ref.@xcite    in fig.[fig1 ] , we present the dependence of the ratio @xmath85 on the lighter stop mass(@xmath79 ) , the lighter stau mass(@xmath80 ) and @xmath51 at the tlep with @xmath86 gev .",
    "we can see that the large values of @xmath85 are obtained when the masses of sparticles involving in the loop become small .",
    "due to the @xmath66-channel suppression , the cross section of @xmath14 for @xmath87 gev is smaller than the one for @xmath16 gev .",
    "the maximal value of @xmath85 can be 1.47(1.38 ) times larger than the sm prediction at @xmath3 gev , which corresponds to the cross section to be 0.147(0.0493 ) fb in the mssm . when the stop mass becomes heavy",
    ", the value of @xmath85 will be small but can still be enhanced by a light stau with large @xmath51 .",
    "the reason is that the dominant contribution of sfermions to @xmath13 comes from the stau loop , which can be understood from the followings : the leading part of the amplitudes of the sfermions loop is proportional to @xmath88 @xcite . to satisfy the requirement of the higgs mass , heavy stops or a large mixing parameter @xmath89",
    "is needed .",
    "the light @xmath90 can be obtained by the large @xmath89 but accompanies with a heavy @xmath91 .",
    "this will lead to a small stop mixing angle @xmath92 and reduce the stop loop contribution .",
    "however , the light stau can be achieved without a large @xmath93 by setting the relevant soft mass parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "so only a light stau with a large value of @xmath51 can sizably contribute to the process @xmath13 .",
    "on the lightest chargino mass(@xmath94 ) and the lighter stau mass(@xmath80 ) at the tlep with @xmath82 gev .",
    "the bound on the @xmath95 is taken from the right panel of fig.8 in ref .",
    "@xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=226 ]   on the lightest chargino mass(@xmath94 ) and the lighter stau mass(@xmath80 ) at the tlep with @xmath82 gev .",
    "the bound on the @xmath95 is taken from the right panel of fig.8 in ref .",
    "@xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=226 ]    in fig.[fig2 ] , we show the effects of @xmath96 and @xmath80 in the ratio @xmath85 .",
    "we can see that when the mass of @xmath97 is below 400 gev , the mass of @xmath98 is always smaller than about 200 gev .",
    "this is because that such a light stau is needed to co - annihilate with the neutralino dark matter(@xmath99 ) to guarantee the correct dark matter relic density @xcite . due to the imposed gut relation between @xmath100 and @xmath101 , the dominant component of lsp in our case is bino - like with a mass larger about 50 gev .",
    "the lux exclusion can probe deeply into the higgsino and wino components . after imposing lux , the wino and higgsino fractions of the lsp for our surviving samples are further constrained and each of them consists of less than 7% .",
    "we also find that the contribution of light @xmath97 loop is much smaller than the light stau loop .",
    "it is because that the coupling @xmath102 is determined by the component of @xmath97 , which can be large only when @xmath97 is a mixture of higgsino and wino @xcite .",
    "but in the mass range @xmath103 gev , we find that @xmath97 is dominated by wino , which will highly suppress the contribution of @xmath97 loop . besides , the light wino - like chargino in our study",
    "may be constrained by the latest results from the searches for @xmath104 at the lhc @xcite . in our calculations , since we decouple the contributions of the first two generations of slepton and assume the gut relation between @xmath100 and @xmath101 , we estimate the impact of this bound on @xmath85 by simply using the result for @xmath105 on the right panel of fig.8 in the atlas paper @xcite , where @xmath106 and @xmath94 are assumed to be pure winos .",
    "we can see that the values of @xmath85 are slightly reduced by this constraint .",
    "however , it should be noted that this direct search bound can become weak when a small portion of higgsino is involved in @xmath106 and @xmath94 .",
    "so , given these considerations , we do not impose this constraint in our study .     at the tlep for @xmath86 gev with @xmath33 and @xmath34 at the lhc.,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=264 ]   at the tlep for @xmath86 gev with @xmath33 and @xmath34 at the lhc.,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=264 ]    in fig.[fig3 ] , we study the correlation of @xmath85 at the tlep with the signal strengthes @xmath33 and @xmath34 at the lhc , which are defined as followings : @xmath107 we adopt the narrow width approximation method to calculate the processes @xmath108 . since the dominant production is from the gluon fusion , the total cross section @xmath109 can be approximately written as @xmath110 . in the calculation of @xmath111 , we use 2-loop evolution for the strong coupling constant @xmath112 with qcd parameter @xmath113 and obtain @xmath114 .",
    "we take cteq6 m as the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) @xcite and set the renormalization scale @xmath115 and factorization scale @xmath116 to be @xmath117 .",
    "note that , the dependence of results on the pdf and scale setting is very weak because of the cancelation between numerator and denominator in the ratios .",
    "it can be seen that the ratio @xmath85 is approximately proportional to @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the reason is that the loop - induced couplings @xmath1 and @xmath2 can simultaneously contribute to the process @xmath14 , when both of @xmath33 and @xmath34 get the enhancement from light stau , @xmath85 can be significantly enhanced and maximally reach about 1.47(1.38 ) at the tlep with @xmath3 gev .",
    "this correlation behavior is different from some non - susy models predictions @xcite , and may be used as complementary way to discriminate new physics models .",
    "therefore , the measurement of @xmath14 at the tlep may be helpful to test the anomalous gauge couplings @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the mssm .",
    "in spite of the discovery of the higgs boson , the precise measurement of the higgs boson and the searches for new physics beyond the sm are just starting . in particular , the rare productions and decays of the higgs boson that sensitive to the new physics are worth thoroughly exploring at the future colliders . however , given the limited capability of the lhc , it is necessary to consider those rare processes at a @xmath4 collider . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the rare production process @xmath14 that involves two sensitive loop induced couplings @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the mssm at a future higgs factory , such as tlep with @xmath86 gev .",
    "we found that the mssm corrections can enhance the cross section to be 0.147(0.0493 ) fb by a light stau with large @xmath118 at @xmath3 gev .",
    "by virtue of the high luminosity of tlep , such a rare process may have a potential to be observed at tlep .",
    "besides , we analyzed the correlation between the @xmath4 collider signal strength @xmath85 and the lhc signal strengths @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we found that they have a strong positive correlation , which is different from some non - susy models predictions .",
    "so such a correlation behavior may play a complementary role to discriminate new physics models in the future .",
