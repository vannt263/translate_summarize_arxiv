    "particle detectors consisting of scintillating fiber arrays instrumented with visible light photon counters ( vlpc s ) are being constructed for the next generation of collider experiments @xcite .",
    "the fast signal response of these detectors allow their use in environments with high event rates .",
    "furthermore , the low noise and linear gain characteristics of the vlpc s allow accurate photon counting .",
    "this report presents measurements of the time resolution for charged particle detection for a practical scintillating fiber detector instrumented with vlpc s and makes predictions of expected future performance .",
    "this information is critical to determine the efficacy of using time difference measurements on such systems to calculate the longitudinal position of a charged particle or shower impacting the fiber .",
    "also reported are linearity measurements of the vlpc response for light intensities up to @xmath0 incident photons per event .",
    "this linearity study is relevant to detectors using vlpc s for calorimetry .",
    "the vlpc is a solid - state photomultiplier",
    "@xcite optimized for visible light detection and developed by rockwell international @xcite .",
    "these devices provide excellent performance as light detectors since they have a fast gain of approximately @xmath1 per photoelectron ( within 40  ns ) with a quantum efficiency of up to 80%  @xcite .",
    "their major drawback as photodetectors is the requirement that they be operated at liquid helium temperatures .",
    "the measurements reported here stem from engineering studies by a subgroup of the 0 collaboration which plans to have two scintillator / vlpc systems for its upgraded detector : a scintillating fiber central tracker for charged particle tracking and triggering , and a preshower detector for electron identification and triggering .",
    "preliminary operating conditions for the proposed systems have been chosen based on extensive studies of the vlpc @xcite .",
    "the operating parameters chosen for these timing and linearity measurements reflect those plans .",
    "the vlpc s are histe - iv models with 1 mm@xmath2 pixels which were mounted in a cassette @xcite and located in a liquid helium cooled cryostat .",
    "the cassette contained one 50  cm long clear multiclad polystyrene fiber for each pixel which provided a light path from a room temperature fiber connector .",
    "the vlpc s were operated at 6.5  k with a bias voltage of 6.5  v. the light source was commercial polystyrene scintillator doped with 1% p - terphenyl and 1500  ppm of 3-hydroxyflavone ( 3hf ) .",
    "this combination produced visible light peaked in wavelength at 530  nm @xcite with a fluorescence decay time of 8.2  @xmath3  0.2  ns @xcite ; this wavelength is well matched to the spectral response of the vlpc .",
    "the basic experimental setup for the timing tests is shown in fig .",
    "[ timset ] .",
    "the system timing tests required that scintillating fiber act as the light source to account for light dispersion within the fiber .",
    "the fiber was commercial double - clad 3hf scintillating fiber  @xcite as proposed for the upgraded 0 tracking system .",
    "the fiber was instrumented on both ends , with the time difference ( @xmath4 ) between receipt of the signal at each end being the quantity of interest .",
    "constraints within the existing 0 detector require that the cryostats containing the vlpc s be physically separated from the tracking detector , so in some cases a clear fiber of 8  m length was used as a light guide between the scintillating fiber and the cassette containing the vlpc s .",
    "relevant parameters for the fibers are given in table  [ table_fiber ] .",
    "mineral oil was used as the optical coupling between diamond - polished fiber ends within mating connectors .",
    ".specifications for scintillating and clear fiber . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the 20% systematic uncertainty in light intensity was not used for the monte carlo results shown in fig .",
    "[ tdc_mc_d ] .",
    "figure  [ tdc_light_vary ] shows the variation in time resolution for the longest fiber configuration when the light intensity is varied by @xmath5 ; the nominal light intensity is given by the points with statistical error bars .",
    "while both measurement and simulation show that the time resolution depends strongly on the incident light intensity , this uncertainty does not account for the difference between the prediction and the data .",
    "based on the disagreement observed , which can be attributed to the simplicity of the simulation , predictions of future performance are quoted with a systematic uncertainty of @xmath6 .",
    "the longitudinal position resolution for a charged particle impacting a fiber detector is a linear function of the system time resolution , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the speed of light and @xmath9 is the refractive index of the fiber .",
    "the factor @xmath10 is a function of the light intensity , and in this application represents the deviation of the average longitudinal speed of the first detected photon from the speed of light in the fiber , assuming an even distribution of light .",
    "the monte carlo model described above indicates that for the lowest possible light intensity with the standard fiber , one detected photon on each end , @xmath11 .",
    "the value of @xmath10 approaches unity with increasing light intensity with @xmath12 for ten total photoelectrons .",
    "the following discussion assumes @xmath13 .",
    "tests with cosmic ray muons indicate that a minimum ionizing particle typically produces @xmath1410 total photoelectrons for the longest fiber configuration tested here .",
    "the results given above then indicate a position resolution of @xmath1460  cm for a minimum ionizing particle . thus time measurements are not a reasonable option for longitudinal position determination in the type of detector constructed for these tests .",
    "comparison of the simulation with the data suggests that the dominant effects determining the time resolution of the system are the light intensity and the decay time of the scintillator .",
    "time dispersion of photons within the fiber is of secondary importance .",
    "thus , dramatic improvements would arise from a faster wave - shifter or more light production .",
    "furthermore , a new version of the vlpc , histe - v , has a factor of @xmath142.5 higher gain which should provide 100% efficiency for time measurements with a single photoelectron ; this should effect a modest improvement in time resolution for low multiplicity events .",
    "the preceding observations motivated a final set of simulations yielding predictions of the time resolution as a function of total number of photoelectrons produced for two detector configurations : the first using the 3hf fiber , the second using commercially available green scintillating fiber with a decay time of 2.7  ns .",
    "unfortunately , the fast scintillating fibers that are available have attenuation lengths that are small compared to the 3hf fiber .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ mc_tim_res ] .",
    "these results follow from the ideal case where the electronics time resolution is negligible and the tdc s are assumed to be 100% efficient for detecting a single photoelectron .",
    "the photons were assumed to be produced in the longitudinal center of a fiber of total length 20  m.    these final results provide information necessary to understand the effectiveness of using time difference measurements to determine the longitudinal position of a particle or shower in a scintillator detector . as an example , the central fiber tracker proposed for the 0 upgrade will be constructed of scintillating fiber identical to the standard fiber described in table  [ table_fiber ] .",
    "for a single fiber , the expected ten photoelectrons produced by a minimum ionizing particle yield an rms longitudinal position resolution of @xmath1450  cm .",
    "0 s proposed tracking detector would eliminate gaps by densely packing two layers of fibers for each superlayer .",
    "instrumenting fiber doublets would then increase the mean number of photoelectrons to 20 and should improve the position resolution to @xmath1427  cm for each superlayer .",
    "this resolution could be useful to eliminate combinatoric background in a tracking - based trigger .",
    "as another example , the central preshower detector proposed for the 0 upgrade is expected to have a minimum trigger threshold of @xmath1480  photoelectrons for electron candidates  @xcite . using wavelength shifting fiber with the same fluorescence decay time",
    "as that used for the tracker would yield an rms longitudinal position resolution of @xmath1412  cm .",
    "this resolution is acceptable for certain trigger requirements and , like all of the scenarios discussed here , could be dramatically improved by using fiber with a faster decay time .",
    "the linearity tests shared the vlpc cassette and cryogenic system with the timing tests ; other details of the system differed . a block diagram of the experimental setup is shown in fig .  [ linblock ] .",
    "because timing was not an issue for this study , bulk scintillator with the same composition as the fiber core was used as the light source .",
    "a schematic of the light source is shown in fig .",
    "[ linset4 ] .",
    "the scintillator was illuminated with an ultraviolet ( uv ) nitrogen laser producing pulsed light ( @xmath15  =  337.1  nm ) with a width of 3  ns at a frequency of 10  hz . the uv light activated the wavelength shifting component of the scintillator which subsequently produced visible light .",
    "this configuration provided a constant intensity light source with the appropriate wavelength spectrum .",
    "the low pulse frequency ensured adequate recovery time for the vlpc .",
    "absorptive neutral density filters ( ndf s ) attenuated the light by known factors and served as the reference by which linearity was judged .",
    "a liquid light guide transported the light from the source to the vlpc cassette .",
    "three preamplifier configurations were used to ensure that the limited dynamic range of any single amplifier did not affect the measurement .",
    "the highest gain preamplifier was similar to that used for the timing tests but lacked the second stage of amplification ; this improved its dynamic range .",
    "the mid - gain preamplifier was of the same design but attenuated the signal from the vlpc at the input .",
    "the lowest gain `` preamp '' was a circuit allowing the vlpc to be directly read by the input stage of the digital signal analyzer .",
    "thus , the signal was not amplified at all , and any saturation seen at this point was due to the vlpc rather than any intervening electronics .",
    "figure  [ vlpc_dir ] shows a schematic of the low gain circuit .    a commercial digital signal analyzer ( dsa ) , tektronix model dsa  602a  @xcite , was used to integrate the charge from the output stage of the preamplifier .",
    "the signal was averaged over the 512 events prior to the measurement with the systematic uncertainty being determined by varying the gate width from 40  ns to 80  ns .",
    "the measurement error of the dsa was small compared to the systematic uncertainty assigned to the measurement .",
    "the photoelectron scale was set in the same manner as described above for the timing measurements using a camac adc to record the integrated charge distribution for the lowest intensity configuration .",
    "the mean number of photoelectrons from this distribution then served as the reference for all configurations since the filters attenuated the signal by a known amount .",
    "a 10% uncertainty was assigned to the optical density of the filters in accordance with the manufacturer s specifications .",
    "the measurement of the mean number of photoelectrons for the reference configuration was assigned a systematic uncertainty of 15% which is fully correlated for all points .",
    "two channels contributed to the linearity measurement .",
    "figure  [ newch114lin ] shows the response of the vlpc as a function of the number of photoelectrons produced for one channel .",
    "figure  [ newch114percdev ] shows the percent deviation from linearity for the same channel .",
    "the uncorrelated uncertainties are given by the error bars ; there is an additional 15% uncertainty in the photoelectron scale",
    ". this vlpc is linear to within 10% out to @xmath14600 photoelectrons .",
    "a similar result was obtained from the other tested channel .",
    "the vlpc provides high gain due to fast avalanche multiplication of charge within the device .",
    "as described in the literature  @xcite , the avalanche produces a space charge in a small area inhibiting subsequent avalanches within the recovery time of the device which could be as long as 1  ms .",
    "a monte carlo model was developed to characterize the surface size of two idealized regions : a small region for which subsequent avalanches were fully inhibited yielding a dead area , and a larger region for which the average gain for subsequent avalanches was reduced by 10% .",
    "the model assumed that the affected regions were circular , and that the recovery time of the device was long compared to the time distribution of photons in a given event . to characterize the size of the smaller region",
    ", it was assumed that the avalance due to a single photoelectron left the circular area completely dead for subsequent photons .",
    "in such a model , complete coverage of the active area of the vlpc would result in saturation .",
    "assuming that full saturation begins for @xmath141@xmath16 photoelectrons as suggested by fig .",
    "[ newch114lin ] , the simulation reveals the radius of the dead region to be 1  @xmath17 m .",
    "this is consistent with theoretical calculations  @xcite .",
    "the small size of the dead region also suggests an explanation for the deviation from linearity that is observed to begin at @xmath14600 photoelectrons .",
    "since the gain region is only 5  @xmath17 m thick , the space charge is concentrated in a region that is",
    "only 12  @xmath17 m on a side .",
    "this clump of positive charge will then distort the local field causing some loss of amplification for nearby photoelectrons that are outside the dead region .",
    "for an average gain reduction of 10% , the same monte carlo model was used to estimate the diameter of the affected circular region at 23  @xmath17 m .",
    "this result must be interpreted as the average cut - off diameter since the model assumes a rigid cut - off whereas the field distortion will likely cause a continuous reduction in gain .",
    "the results given by this model allow a prediction of vlpc linearity for systems with different coverage of vlpc pixels than the apparatus described here .",
    "these results indicate that the vlpc is an ideal device for calorimetric applications .",
    "it can provide high sensitivity and can accept large incident light intensities .",
    "the time resolution was measured for a scintillating fiber detector instrumented on both ends with histe - iv vlpc s operated at 6.5 k and with a bias voltage of 6.5 v. the measurements were shown to agree with predictions from a simple monte carlo simulation incorporating only the decay time of the scintillator , the mean light intensity , and the dispersion in the fiber as modeled with a simple ray - tracing algorithm .",
    "the light intensity coupled with the decay time of the scintillator clearly dominates the resolution .",
    "the results of the study suggest that time difference measurements are not attractive for longitudinal position measurements in single fibers unless the fiber has a short fluorescence decay time ( @xmath182  ns ) .",
    "higher light intensities ( which are expected in electromagnetic showers ) provide a more acceptable position resolution .    measurements also addressed the linearity of histe - iv vlpc s over a wide range of incident light intensities . with a bias voltage of 6.5",
    "v at 6.5 k , the vlpc was shown to have a linear response up to @xmath14600 photoelectrons , and the vlpc output continued to increase monotonically up to incident light intensities producing at least @xmath19 photoelectrons .",
