    "the use of multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) antenna systems in multiuser environments has recently gained considerable attention .",
    "much progress has been made on characterizing the fundamental limits and developing signal processing schemes for both the multiple - access channel and broadcast channel scenarios ( see , eg .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we consider the broadcast channel , which embraces a large number of important application scenarios ; for example , a base - station serving multiple users in a cellular environment , or a relay node serving multiple network nodes in an ad - hoc network .    for systems with perfect feedback capabilities ,",
    "i.e.  when complete short - term channel state information ( csi ) of all of the users are available to the transmitter , it is well - known that the optimum solution for achieving the capacity is to employ dirty paper coding ( dpc ) .",
    "however , while dpc is capacity achieving , it also has prohibitive complexity .",
    "this , coupled with the stringent and potentially overwhelming feedback requirements , render dpc unsuitable for practical implementation .",
    "various low complexity alternatives have been employed and studied extensively ( see , eg .",
    "@xcite ) , however these schemes all require perfect knowledge of the csi at the transmitter . for increasing number of users and antennas ,",
    "the amount of csi feedback becomes large , and these schemes become impractical .",
    "in addition , inaccurate csi feedback may lead to significant performance losses @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we are interested in the practical scenarios when there is limited or no feedback of csi at the transmitter . in this case , efficient scheduling algorithms are required for coordinating transmissions to the different users .",
    "appropriate scheduling approaches depend on the feedback capabilities between the receivers and the transmitter , and their performance can be measured in terms of the maximum sum - rate .    for systems with no feedback capabilities ,",
    "an obvious and practical scheduling approach is to employ a simple round - robin scheduling algorithm ; i.e.  a time - division multiple access ( tdma ) scheme .",
    "the maximum sum - rate in this case becomes equivalent to the maximum sum - rate of a single user mimo system .",
    "the single user mimo maximum sum - rate has been extensively studied for optimal receivers ( see , eg .",
    "@xcite ) , and zero forcing ( zf ) linear receivers ( see , eg .",
    "other results include the particular case where the number of transmit antennas is less than or equal to the number of receive antennas in the high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) regime , for which the maximum sum - rate has been derived for zf and minimum mean squared error ( mmse ) receivers in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . 8.54 ) . in this paper",
    ", we derive new exact maximum sum - rate expressions for both the maximum ratio combining ( mrc ) and mmse receivers .",
    "we also derive new maximum sum - rate expressions in the high snr regime for mmse receivers in the case where the number of transmit antennas is greater than the number of receive antennas , and for mrc receivers in the case of arbitrary antenna configurations .",
    "we then investigate the maximum sum - rate in the low snr regime for each of the three linear receivers .",
    "when limited feedback is available , the scheduling algorithm can be more sophisticated . in this paper",
    "we consider the common case of systems which feed back signal - to - interference - and - noise ratios ( sinrs ) and use opportunistic scheduling . in particular , we examine systems where the sinr ( for each user ) can be measured from each transmit antenna separately , and then fed back . in the scheduling algorithm each transmit antenna sends an independent data stream to the user with the largest corresponding sinr .",
    "of particular interest is systems employing practical linear receivers .",
    "for the specific case of zf , previous related results have been presented in @xcite , where an upper bound to the asymptotic maximum sum - rate scaling law was derived , and in @xcite , where an exact ( albeit complicated ) non - asymptotic expression was derived .",
    "moreover , for the specific case of four transmit and two receive antennas , @xcite presented maximum sum - rate scaling laws for the mrc and mmse receivers . in this paper , we generalize these prior results , by considering the maximum sum - rate for arbitrary antenna configurations , and deriving new maximum sum - rate results for mrc , zf and mmse receivers .",
    "we present new accurate approximations for the maximum sum - rate , and derive exact maximum sum - rate scaling laws .",
    "we show that all three linear receivers converge to the same asymptotic maximum sum - rate as the number of users grows large , however the speed of convergence is different .",
    "our results are confirmed through comparison with monte carlo simulations .    throughout this paper , we denote @xmath0 $ ] as expectation , @xmath1 as conjugate transpose , @xmath2 as matrix trace , @xmath3 as a @xmath4 identity matrix and @xmath5 as a @xmath6 zero matrix . also , @xmath7 denotes kronecker product and @xmath8 represents an @xmath9 matrix - variate complex gaussian distribution with @xmath9 mean matrix @xmath10 and @xmath11 covariance matrix @xmath12 .",
    "we consider a multiuser mimo broadcast channel scenario , where a transmitter has @xmath13 antennas while each of the @xmath14 users has @xmath15 antennas .",
    "each antenna at the transmitter is used to independently transmit a stream of data to a particular user , as determined by the two scheduling algorithms described in the next two sections .",

    "we present exact and approximate results , and compare the performance of the three linear receivers .",
    "note that we assume all users employ the same receiver structure ( ie .",
    "zf , mmse , or mrc ) .",
    "for multiuser mimo systems with no feedback capabilities , we consider a simple scheduling algorithm where each transmit antenna is assigned to users in a round robin manner .",
    "this includes any scenario where each user is served by each transmit antenna for equal time periods and the data streams received by the users are decoded independently .",

    "although these systems have been studied extensively , there still remains important open work in this area .",
    "specifically , in this section we present new exact and high snr closed - form expressions for the maximum sum - rate in ( [ eq : cap_fair ] ) with mrc and mmse receivers .",

    "monte carlo simulated curves are also presented for further verification . as expected , we see that the maximum sum - rate of mmse is greater than for mrc and zf for all snr values .",
    "we also see an snr crossover point , such that the maximum sum - rate of mrc is greater than zf below the crossover point and less than zf above the crossover point .",

    "we see that for a fixed @xmath15 , increasing @xmath13 increases the crossover point , however for a fixed @xmath13 , increasing @xmath15 decreases the crossover point .",

    "we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : percent_mmsebf_greater ] that when @xmath65 , the maximum sum - rate of mrc is comparable to mmse , and approaches the mmse maximum sum - rate for increasing @xmath13 .",

    "[ fig : percent_mmsebf_same ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : percent_mmsebf_less ] that increasing the number of transmit antennas has the detrimental effect of reducing the percentage of maximum sum - rate achievable .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that for the mmse receiver , when @xmath44 , there are enough receive antennas to cancel the interference from the transmit antennas , hence adding more transmit antennas does not decrease the snr as much as it does for the mrc receiver .      at high snr , for antenna configurations with @xmath44 ,",
    "expressions for the maximum sum - rate of mmse receivers have been derived in ( * ? ? ?",

    "however , corresponding results are not available . in this case , the maximum sum - rate of mmse receivers approach a constant at high snr . in appendix",
    "[ app : bfzfmmse_highsnr ] , we derive this constant as follows . ]",
    "@xmath72 considering mrc receivers , for @xmath73 the maximum sum - rate also approaches a constant at high snr . following a similar approach to that used for the mmse receiver",
    ", we evaluate this constant as follows @xmath74 for @xmath75 , the maximum sum - rate of zf and mmse scales logarithmically with the snr ( * ? ? ?",
    "8.54 ) instead of approaching a constant , and hence always performs better than mrc as expected . from ( [ eq : cap_mmse_highsnr ] ) and ( [ eq : cap_bf_highsnr ] ) , this can also be shown to be the case when @xmath76 , where the maximum sum - rate of mmse outperforms mrc .",
    "however , ( [ eq : cap_mmse_highsnr ] ) and ( [ eq : cap_bf_highsnr ] ) reveal the interesting fact that for high snr , if @xmath15 is kept fixed and @xmath77 , the maximum sum - rate of mrc approaches that of mmse . this can be intuitively explained by noting that for mmse , when @xmath76 , there is not enough degrees of freedom for the receiver to cancel the interference imposed by the transmit antennas .",
    "therefore , as @xmath13 grows large , both mmse and mrc suffer significant interference penalty .",
    "as such , for sufficiently large @xmath13 , the interference cancelation capabilities of mmse become insignificant , and the performance of the two receivers coincide .    the accuracy of ( [ eq : cap_mmse_highsnr ] ) and ( [ eq : cap_bf_highsnr ] ) is confirmed in the `` analytical ( high snr ) '' curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : cap_linrrec_mmsebf ] , where we plot these expressions ( without the @xmath78 terms ) as well as monte carlo simulated curves . for all cases considered ,",

    ", we also plot the exact `` analytical '' curves from ( [ eq : cap_bf_fair ] ) and ( [ eq : cap_mmse_fair ] ) , and see an exact match with the monte carlo simulated curves .",
    "we now investigate the maximum sum - rate of the three linear receivers in the low snr regime .",
    "the simplest approach is to derive a first order taylor expansion of @xmath79 as @xmath80 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite however , that such an approach does not adequately reveal the impact of the channel , and may in fact lead to misguided conclusions . moreover , as discussed in detail in @xcite , in the low snr ( or wideband ) regime it is more appropriate to investigate the maximum sum - rate in terms of the normalized transmit energy per information bit , @xmath81 , rather than snr . in this case the maximum sum - rate representation is given for low @xmath81 levels by the following expression @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the minimum normalized energy per information bit required to convey any positive rate reliably , and @xmath84 is the wideband slope in bits / sec / hz/(3 db ) at the point @xmath83 .",
    "note that @xmath84 and @xmath83 can also be used to determine the bandwidth of a system designed to achieve a certain rate subject to power limitations @xcite .",
    "now as @xmath80 , it can be shown from ( [ eq : snr_bf ] ) and ( [ eq : snr_mmse ] ) that the sinr , and hence the maximum sum - rate , of the mmse and mrc receivers coincide . in appendix [ app : lowsnr_bf_mmse ] we derive closed - form solutions for @xmath85 and @xmath84 for both mrc and mmse as @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively . for zf receivers , we derive @xmath85 and @xmath84 as @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively .",
    "the proof is omitted due to space limitations , but involves solving ( [ eq : ebno_s0 ] ) using the p.d.f .  in ( [ eq : pdf_zf ] ) , along with some algebraic manipulation .",
    "we see from ( [ eq : ebno_bfmmse ] ) and ( [ eq : ebno_zf ] ) that @xmath90 , and from ( [ eq : s0_bfmmse ] ) and ( [ eq : s0_zf ] ) that @xmath91 ; in both cases , with equality if @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , as expected , whenever @xmath93 , the low snr maximum sum - rate of the mrc and mmse receivers always exceeds the maximum sum - rate of zf .",
    "the new results given by ( [ eq : ebno_bfmmse])([eq : s0_zf ] ) precisely quantify this maximum sum - rate difference .",
    "in addition , it is interesting to note that @xmath94 depends only on the number of receive antennas , also observed in @xcite for optimal receivers , whereas @xmath95 depends on both the number of transmit and receive antennas .",
    "in fact , we see that increasing the number of transmit antennas for a fixed number of receive antennas has the negative impact of increasing @xmath95 .",
    "for multiuser mimo systems with feedback capabilities , we consider a low - rate feedback approach where each user sends to the transmitter a set of @xmath13 instantaneous sinr values .",
    "these correspond to the instantaneous sinrs at the output of the linear receiver ; one for each transmit antenna .",
    "specifically , depending on the particular linear receiver employed , the sinrs are calculated based on the average snr and the channel matrix , according to either ( [ eq : snr_bf ] ) , ( [ eq : snr_zf ] ) or ( [ eq : snr_mmse ] ) , for mrc , zf , and mmse respectively ; assuming the signal from one antenna is the desired signal while the signals from the other antennas are interference .",
    "we employ an opportunistic scheduling algorithm which selects , for each transmit antenna , the user with the maximum sinr .",

    "note that , for the case of zf , exact expressions have been derived previously in @xcite .",
    "those results , however , incurred high computational complexity which increased significantly with the number of users and , as such , would take time comparable to monte carlo simulations to produce meaningful plots . as such , we are motivated to consider deriving simpler , more computationally - efficient , accurate approximations for the zf receiver as well .      to obtain closed form expressions for the maximum sum - rate of the linear receivers , we can directly evaluate the integral in ( [ eq : cap_max ] ) by first substituting the c.d.f .",

    "it is also worth noting that when the users are stationary , fairness may become an issue for the sinr - based scheduler , since the transmitter is likely to send to a subset of users for the majority of the time .",
