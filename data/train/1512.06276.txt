    "a promising platform to quantum simulate such novel phenomena of condensed matter physics as topological insulators @xcite and superconductors @xcite is the spin - orbit coupled cold atomic systems @xcite which have drawn great attention in recent years .",
    "raman dressed coupling between atomic pseudo - spin and its linear momentum was first realized by lin and co - workers @xcite in a two - component ( spin-1/2 ) @xmath0rb condensate , and were soon generalized to spin-1/2 degenerate fermi gases of @xmath1k @xcite and @xmath2li @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "photon recoil associated with the raman transition  facilitated by two counter - propagating laser beams  changes the center - of - mass momentum of the atom when it jumps from one spin state to the other .",
    "very recently , the same spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) scheme was achieved in a spin-1 condensate @xcite . in general , the physics becomes richer in larger spin systems @xcite simply because more spin states are involved and more control knobs can be utilized .    when the two laser beams that induce the raman transition are made to co - propagating , but possess different orbital angular momenta ( e.g. , in the form of laguerre - gaussian , or lg , beams ) @xcite , the raman transition will be accompanied by a transfer of the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) , instead of the linear momentum , to the atom",
    "this situation has been achieved in experiment where this transfer of oam from photon to the atom was exploited to create spin textures in a spinor condensate @xcite .",
    "several recent theoretical proposals also explored this effect to realize spin - orbit - angular - momentum ( soam ) coupling in spin-1/2 condensate @xcite , where interesting quantum states such as the half skyrmion , the meron pair and the annular striped phase , are predicted to exist .    in this paper , we provide our study of the soam coupling in a weakly interacting spin-1 condensate .",
    "we show that the interplay between the soam coupling and the quadratic zeeman shift produces a rich phase diagram , and a coherent oscillation between two different many - body quantum phases can be induced by quenching the quadratic zeeman term .",

    "if the initial state is within iva , the post - quench dynamics looks rather complicated , and the system would not evolve into any other phases .",
    "finally , we remark that , instead of a quench of @xmath5 , a quench of the interaction strength @xmath103 can induce qualitatively similar dynamics .",

    "motivated by previous experiments and recent theoretical studies of soam coupling in spin-1/2 condensate , we have presented a study of soam coupling in a spin-1 condensate . as we have shown , the enlarged spin degrees of freedom gives rise to much richer physics .",
    "focusing on a regime where the single - particle energy spectrum exhibits a three - minima structure , we mapped out the ground state phase diagram where different phases possess distinct symmetry properties , spin density profiles and spin textures .",
    "we also investigated the dynamics induced by a sudden quench of the quadratic zeeman shift , and found an interesting many - body rabi oscillation between two of the phases .",
