    "the first one , which was actually indicated by p. halmos , relates the ranges of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( more exactly , @xmath7 ) , while the second one is a majorization result between the positive operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( more exactly , @xmath10 for some @xmath11 ) . the solution @xmath2 to the operator equation @xmath6 is uniquely determined if we require , in addition , that @xmath12 .",
    "this particular solution , called the reduced ( or douglas ) solution satisfies , in addition , the conditions @xmath13 and @xmath14 one common approach into the study of the douglas equation @xmath15 involves the theory of generalized inverses . in fact , as it was shown in @xcite ( cf . also @xcite ) , the reduced solution @xmath2 of the above equation can be computed explicitly in terms of the moore - penrose inverse @xmath16 of @xmath1 , more precisely as @xmath17 other facts and applications relating the douglas theorem and the theory of generalized inverses can be found in @xcite .",
    "this theorem has been recently used as an important tool into the study of @xmath0-operators ( with @xmath0 positive ) @xcite , the invertibility of operator matrices @xcite , or the theory of commuting operator tuples associated with the unit ball in @xmath18 @xcite .",

    "when the operators @xmath0 and @xmath1 are only closed and densely defined .",
    "he showed that the range inclusion @xmath20 is sufficient for a factorization of the form @xmath3 , where @xmath2 is a certain densely defined operator .",
    "z. sebestyn @xcite improved the results of douglas and factorized a densely defined operator @xmath0 as @xmath21 where @xmath1 is the adjoint of a densely defined operator , @xmath7 and @xmath2 is minimal in the sense that @xmath22    the concept of linear relation between linear spaces has been introduced by r. arens @xcite in order to extend results in operator theory from singlevalued to multivalued case .",

    "section 3 contains information regarding the existence of an operator @xmath2 such that the factorization @xmath3 holds true .",
    "more exactly , we show that the problem @xmath26 has an operator solution if and only if @xmath27 we extend , in particular , the theorems of r. g. douglas @xcite and z. sebestyn @xcite mentioned above . the problem @xmath28 with operator solutions @xmath29 is considered in the last two parts .",
    "firstly , we associate an operator @xmath2 to any hamel basis @xmath30 for the range of @xmath0 , any hamel basis @xmath31 for the kernel of @xmath0 , any linearly independent family @xmath32 with @xmath33 and any family @xmath34 with @xmath35 such that the subspaces generated by @xmath36 and , respectively , by @xmath37 have null intersection .",
