    "it is found that many tasks can be carried out with quantum correlations other than entanglement @xcite . in particular , the quantum discord @xcite plays an important role in some quantum information processing like to assist optimal state discrimination , in which only one side discord is required in the optimization process of assisted state discrimination , while another side discord and entanglement is not necessary @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , underlying quantum measurements process quantum states are fragile .",
    "when we measure a quantum state in some orthogonal basis , since quantum discord is defined by the povm quantum measurement , the coherence of the state has been loosened .",

    "obviously , our results include the results in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in order to show the potential property of technological implications , we analyze the dynamics of two - qubit x - states under non - dissipative channels and compare super quantum discord with discord by using the explicit formulae .",
    "this is exemplified by the fact that the super quantum discord often larger than the quantum discord defined by projective measurement .",

    "we can get more detail properties from the right side of fig.2 .",
    "the five curves from top to bottom are obtained by choosing the controlling parameters as the weak measurement parameter @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "it can be seen that at @xmath122 or @xmath123 , the super quantum discord is invariant under local bit - flip channel .    from a practical point of view , we sent signals through the bit - flip channel which leaves the qubit untouched with probability @xmath124 , and flips the qubits with probability @xmath125 .",
    "so through bit - flip channel the state @xmath126 was taken to @xmath127 for @xmath122 .",
    "on the contrary , for @xmath123 the state keeps invariant . in this view , the state @xmath128 was not taken @xmath126 to @xmath127 , the super quantum discord also did not change when @xmath122 or @xmath123 .    in view of above argument",
    ", we then conclude that the super quantum discord will decay after through noisy channels .",
    "it means that we will lose information after the signal through noisy , hence have to control the noise probability .",
    "furthermore , the affection of local bit - flip channel for the super quantum discord is symmetric and attains the minimum at @xmath129 , so the noise probability plays a symmetric role in this noisy channel .",
    "it will disappear when the noise probability attaints half of one .",
    "when considering quantum correlations captured by the super quantum discord , it is usually known that the weak measurement captures more information than povm measurement .",
    "however , there are some counterintuitive phenomena in our example when we compare the super quantum discord after noisy channel with discord after noisy channel .        on the fig.3 we can see that the red plane through the blue curve , some blue surface above red plane and others under red plane .",
    "that means after local bit - flip channel , super quantum discord is smaller than the normal quantum discord , and this difference is most obvious when the noise probability @xmath124 near @xmath130 .",
    "although the super quantum discord is smaller than the quantum discord only in the region of @xmath131 to @xmath132 , it shows in this example , the weak measurement does not capture more information than povm measurement .",
    "thus , super quantum discord is a different resource than quantum discord .",
    "super quantum discord is a fundamental resource in quantum information .",
    "we have studied it for x - type states which including the werner states and bell diagonal states .",
    "explicit formulae of super quantum discord for x - type states have been derived .",
    "the evolution of these states under local bit - flip channel has been investigated and reveal more different properties between super quantum discord and quantum discord .",
