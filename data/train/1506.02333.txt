    "it is well - known that the theory of general relativity allows the possible existence of closed timelike curves ( ctcs)@xcite .",
    "however , allowance of time travel generates logical paradoxes such as the _ grandfather paradox _ , in which the time traveller performs an action that causes her future self not to exist .",
    "furthermore , the existence of ctcs can not be incompatible with a standard quantum mechanics , because quantum mechanics allows only unitary evolution . in order to solve these difficulties",
    "deutsch@xcite modifies the standard quantum mechanics , which allows the non - unitary evolution in the presence of ctcs . to escape the _ grandfather paradox _",
    ", in addition , he imposes the self - consistent constraint of ctc interaction ( see eq .",
    "( [ self ] ) .",
    "thus , it makes it possible to explore the properties of ctcs without relying on the exotic spacetime geometries .",
    "then , it is natural to ask how quantum mechanics is modified if deutsch s ctcs ( d - ctcs ) exist . for last few years",
    "this question was explored in the various contexts@xcite . among them",
    "most striking result is that any non - orthogonal states can be perfectly distinguished if one can access to d - ctcs@xcite .",
    "this fact implies that security of usual quantum cryptography scheme such as bb84 protocol@xcite is not guaranteed .",
    "subsequently , the authors of ref.@xcite raised a question on the perfect discrimination and computational power in the presence of d - ctcs .",
    "they argued that when the input state is a labeled mixture , the assistance of ctcs in distinguishability and computational power is of no use .",
    "however , their argument was also criticized in ref.@xcite .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite claimed by constructing the equivalent circuit that the ctcs would be a true powerful resource for quantum information processing .",
    "another nonintuitive result arising due to existence of d - ctcs is that any arbitrary dimensional quantum states can be perfectly cloned if the dimension of the ctc system is infinite@xcite .",
    "thus , the well - known no - cloning theorem@xcite can be broken in the presence of d - ctcs . in our opinion",
    ", however , still it seems to be open problem to determine whether or not the assistance of ctcs allows such nonintuitive results , because the debate between ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite is not concluded yet .",
    "mathematically , the deutsch s self - consistency condition is expressed as @xmath0 = \\rho_{in}^{(ctc)}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are input states of the chronology - respecting ( cr ) and chronology - violating systems , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath3 is a quantum state of system traversing the ctc and @xmath4 is a quantum state of system , which only interacts with @xmath3 , but not traversing the ctc .",
    "the operator @xmath5 represents the unitary interaction between cr and ctc systems .",
    "since the self - consistency condition imposes the equality of input and output ctc states , it naturally solves the _ grandfather paradox_. deutsch showed@xcite that the fixed - point solution of eq .",
    "( [ self ] ) always exists , but it does not necessarily have to be unique .",
    "if there are many solutions , deutsch suggested the _ maximum entropy rule_. if @xmath3 is fixed , the cr system is evolved as @xmath6.\\ ] ] the output state @xmath7 is in general non - unitary evolution of @xmath1 , because @xmath7 depends on both @xmath1 and @xmath3 , and @xmath3 also depends on @xmath1 .",
    "the post - selected ctcs@xcite ( p - ctcs ) are another type of quantum mechanical ctcs , which also solve the paradoxes . in p - ctc picture time travel",
    "effectively represents a quantum communication channel from the future to the past .",
    "if one chooses a quantum teleportation channel as the communication channel , p - ctcs provide a self - consistent picture of quantum mechanical time travel via post - selected quantum teleportation@xcite .",
    "it is based on the horowitz - maldacena `` final state condition''@xcite for black hole evaporation@xcite and , unlike d - ctcs , are consistent with path - integral approaches to ctcs@xcite . in p - ctcs formalism",
    "the state in ctc - system is not explicitly specified while the output state of the cr - system is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "it turned out that though p - ctcs are less powerful resource than d - ctcs in the quantum information processing , they also have a computational and discrimination power@xcite .    in this letter",
    "we explore the following issues . by introducing simple qubit system and general controlled operations mixedness of the cr system",
    "is examined .",
    "the mixedness is measured by a magnitude of bloch vector .",
    "it is shown that the magnitude of bloch vector for qubit system assisted by d - ctcs either preserves or decreases .",
    "thus , the pure cr - state can propagate to mixed state when ctc - qubit travels around the d - ctc . in this sense",
    ", ctc - problem resembles the information loss problem@xcite in hawking radiation@xcite . for p - ctcs , however , the magnitude of bloch vector can increase . in this case",
    "a mixed state can evolve to a pure state .",
    "even the completely mixed state can be converted into a pure state if the controlled operation is chosen appropriately .",
    "we also examine how the entanglement of the cr - system is changed in the presence of ctcs .",
    "while d - ctcs always either preserve or degrade the entanglement , p - ctcs can increase it .",
    "thus , if any partially entangled cr - state is prepared , one can change it into a maximally entangled pure state if p - ctcs assist .",
    "this fact implies that distillation of entanglement@xcite can be easily achieved without preparing the many copies of the partially entangled state if p - ctcs are appropriately exploited .",

    "since both d - ctc and p - ctc allow the non - unitary evolution for cr system , it is natural to ask how the mixedness is changed in the presence of the ctcs .",
    "it is known that single - qubit state is pure or completely mixed when the magnitude of bloch vector is one or zero .",
    "thus , it is natural to choose the magnitude of bloch vector as a measure of mixedness .",
    "the most general interaction between single - qubit cr and ctc systems is unitary group @xmath13 , whose generators are pauli matrices and identity . treating the general @xmath14 interaction seems to be difficult because it has too many free parameters .",
    "since we want to to discuss the mixedness and entanglement issues on the analytic ground , we want to choose more simple interaction . since the controlled - gate is frequently used in the quantum information processing , we choose the controlled-@xmath14 interaction between cr and ctc systems . in this case",
    "@xmath14 is represented by four real parameters as follows ; @xmath15 the initial cr - state is chosen as a general form of one - qubit @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 correspond to the completely mixed and pure states , respectively .",

    "surprisingly , one can always make @xmath54 maximally entangled pure state @xmath55 by choosing @xmath56 .",
    "thus , if p - ctc exists , the distillation of entanglement of cr - system can be easily achieved without preparing multiple copies of the partially entangled state .",
    "it is sufficient to prepare a single copy for complete distillation by choosing @xmath14 appropriately .",
    "the situation is different for the case of d - ctc .",

    "if we choose the maximal entropy ctc - state as deutsch suggested , the maximal degradation of entanglement @xmath67 occurs .",
    "although the theory of general relativity does allow ctc as a solution of einstein field equations , still there are a lot of controversial for existence of ctcs . in this letter",
    "we have addressed two issues , mixedness and entanglement for cr system assuming that d - ctc and/or p - ctc exist(s ) in nature .",
    "it was shown that while d - ctc - assisted qubit can not increase the magnitude of its bloch vector , p - ctc - assisted qubit can . as a result",
    ", the mixed cr - state can evolve to pure cr - state if p - ctc exists .",

    "let us assume that they interacts with each other through some unitary operation . if one uses the subadditivity of the von neumann entropy one can show @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is a von neumann entropy and @xmath70 .",

    "we also have studied the case where the cr - system consists of bipartite partially entangled particles and one of them interacts with ctc system through controlled-@xmath14 operation . for the case of p - ctc",
    "surprisingly the partially entangled state can always be converted into the maximally entangled pure state if the phase angles of @xmath14 are chosen appropriately .",
    "if , therefore , p - ctcs exist , the distillation protocol of entanglement is easily achieved without preparing the multiple copies of the partially entangled state . for the case of d -",
    "ctc such a nonintuitive effect disappears because d - ctc either preserves or decreases the entanglement of cr system .    there are a lot of questions in the context of ctcs . how to incorporate the general relativistic ctcs into the quantum mechanical ctcs or _",

    "while p - ctc allows only the evolution of pure state to pure state , d - ctc allow the evolution of pure state to mixed state .",

    "the information loss problem was discussed in ref.@xcite by introducing a simple toy model .",
    "of course , rigorous and explicit analysis should be addressed to clarify a connection between existence of ctcs and information loss problem .",
    "probably , the theory of quantum gravity may give some answers in the future .",
    "another interesting issue is to check whether our results of mixedness and entanglement in the presence of ctcs are valid for general interaction @xmath13 or not .",
