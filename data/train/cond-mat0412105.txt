    "the coherent formation of ultracold diatomic molecules from quantum - degenerate bosonic or fermionic atomic gases , via either feshbach resonances  @xcite or two - photon raman photoassociation  @xcite , has witnessed spectacular developments in recent years and has lead to the first realization of molecular condensates  @xcite . because in these experiments the molecular field is initially in a vacuum state , it is to be expected that quantum fluctuations play a dominant role in the early stages of molecule formation .",
    "these fluctuations manifest themselves in the quantum statistics of the resulting molecular field , and also in the time that it takes for the number of generated molecules to reach a specific value , the so - called passage time statistics .",
    "this problem is closely related to other situations where quantum ( or thermal ) fluctuations trigger a system to undergo a transition away from a dynamically unstable state .",
    "one such example familiar from quantum optics is superradiance @xcite ( or strictly speaking superfluorescence ) , a situation where an ensemble of two - level systems initially in their excited electronic state and coupled to the electromagnetic field vacuum undergoes a transition characterized by the emission of an intense light pulse .",
    "one important difference is that in superfluorescence experiments the atoms are normally coupled to a continuum of modes of the radiation field , practically leading to an irreversible decay to their ground state , while in the problem at hand the molecular field is to a good approximation single - mode , leading to reversible dynamics .",
    "one important way to characterize the dynamics of molecule formation is by way of the so - called passage time , which is defined as the time it takes to produce a predetermined number of molecules .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the passage time statistics resulting from the initial quantum fluctuations of the atomic matter - wave field .",
    "we also compare this situation with the dynamics of dissociation of a molecular condensate into fermionic atomic pairs , showing significant qualitative differences between the two cases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii establishes our notation , presents our model , and shows that the application of an anderson mapping @xcite leads to the description of photoassociation of fermions in terms of the inhomogeneously broadened tavis - cummings model of quantum optics .",
    "section iii concentrates on a `` homogeneously broadened '' version of this model that neglects the spread in fermion energies , an approximation shown to be valid for sufficiently small numbers of atoms .",
    "there we also discuss an approximate stochastic classical description @xcite that yields a satisfactory qualitative agreement with the full quantum results for short enough times .",
    "this section concludes by comparing the passage time statistics associated with photoassociation and the reverse process of photodissociation .",
    "the results of a numerical analysis of the full , inhomogeneously broadened model are presented in section iv .",
    "finally section v is a summary and outlook .",
    "in typical experiments that produce molecules via feshbach resonance the magnetic field is swept across the resonance . in the strong coupling regime @xmath0 in the vicinity of the resonance , where @xmath1 is the fermi wave number and @xmath2 is the s - wave scattering length , the interpretation of the molecular state is subject to conceptual difficulties stemming from the dressing of the `` bare '' molecular state by atom pairs in the open channel  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since the binding energy of the molecules is very small , of the order @xmath3ev , they are larger than the interatomic separation .",
    "another consequence of the almost vanishing binding energy is that nearly every time - dependent process becomes nonadiabatic with respect to the time scale set by the inverse of the binding energy . to avoid these difficulties",
    "we restrict our considerations in this paper to the description of a quantum - degenerate gas of fermionic atoms of mass @xmath4 and spin @xmath5 , coupled coherently to bosonic molecules of mass @xmath6 and zero momentum via _ photoassociation _ rather than feshbach resonance .    neglecting collisions between fermions and assuming that for short enough times the molecules can be described by a single - mode bosonic field , this system can be described by the boson - fermion model hamiltonian    @xmath7    where @xmath8 are molecular bosonic creation and annihilation operators and @xmath9 are fermionic creation and annihilation operators describing atoms of momentum @xmath10 and spin @xmath11 .",
    "the first and second terms in eq .",
    "( [ hamil1 ] ) describe the energy , @xmath12 , of the atoms , and the detuning energy of the molecules respectively , and the third term describes the photoassociation of pairs of atoms of opposite momentum into molecules .    introducing the pseudo - spin operators @xcite @xmath13 which are easily seen to obey the su(2 ) commutation relations",
    "@xmath14 & = & 2\\delta_{kk'}\\hat{\\sigma}^z_k\\\\ \\left[\\hat{\\sigma}^z_{k},\\hat{\\sigma}^\\pm_{k'}\\right ] & = & \\pm\\delta_{kk'}\\hat{\\sigma}^\\pm_k,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the kronecker delta function , the hamiltonian ( [ hamil1 ] ) becomes , within an unimportant constant @xcite , @xmath16 this hamiltonian is known in quantum optics as the inhomogeneously broadened ( or non - degenerate ) tavis - cummings model  @xcite .",
    "it describes the coupling of an ensemble of two - level atoms to a single - mode electromagnetic field .",
    "hence the mapping ( [ a - mapping ] ) establishes the formal analogy between the problem at hand and dicke superradiance , with the caveat already mentioned that we are dealing with a single bosonic mode  @xcite . instead of real two - level atoms , pairs of fermionic atoms",
    "are now described as effective two - level systems whose ground state corresponds to the absence of a pair , @xmath17 and the excited state to a pair of atoms of opposite momenta , @xmath18 where the product is taken up to the fermi surface for @xmath19 , while the molecular field is in the vacuum state @xmath20 .",
    "we concentrate in the following on times short enough that the atomic sample remains essentially undepleted and it is sufficient to consider only fermionic levels up to the fermi surface in eq .",
    "( [ hamil2 ] ) .",
    "we consider first the simplified situation of a degenerate model in which the inhomogeneous broadening due to the spread in atomic kinetic energies is ignored .",
    "this is justified provided that these energies are small compared to the atom - molecule coupling energy , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the fermi energy .",
    "this approximation is the analog of the homogeneous broadening limit of quantum optics , and of the raman - nath approximation in atomic diffraction . as we will find it is valid only for relatively small ( @xmath23 ) particle numbers , but the model exhibits the essential physics .",
    "the atom - molecule coupling has been estimated  @xcite for the case of @xmath24rb to be @xmath25 m@xmath26s@xmath27 , so that @xmath28 in the last term we have related the fermi energy and volume to the oscillator frequency @xmath29 of a spherically symmetric harmonic trap via @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the oscillator length .",
    "typical experiments use traps with @xmath33 hz . in the case of",
    "@xmath24rb the trap should contain at most @xmath34 atom pairs to be in this regime , i.e. to have @xmath35 . for larger samples ,",
    "it is necessary to account for the inhomogeneous broadening of the sample , a situation that we consider in the next section . for any atom numbers ,",
    "the characteristic time scale is given @xmath36s for parameters used in this paper .",
    "limiting for now our considerations to small atomic samples , we approximate all @xmath37 s by @xmath38 and introduce the collective pseudo - spin operators @xmath39 which again obey su(2 ) commutation relations , yielding the standard tavis - cummings hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath40 this hamiltonian conserves the total spin operator @xmath41 , which , by using the pseudo - spin commutation relations , can be expressed as @xmath42 with @xmath43 so that @xmath44 . here",

    "both approaches agree within @xmath72 until about @xmath73 of the population of atom pairs has been converted into molecules .",
    "note that @xmath74 this is indicative of the fact that for short times the molecule field is thermal in character , see for example @xcite and references therein .",

    "this is the non - vanishing part of the second - order moment @xmath77 , which is a measure of fluctuations of the atomic field .",

    "the classical result reproduces qualitatively the broad and asymmetric distribution of the quantum solution .",
    "however , it does not reproduce well the leading and trailing edges of the distribution , which depend on the higher order moments of the classical field @xmath82 and are poorly treated by the assumption of gaussian noise .",
    "in addition the continuous distribution of the classical model fails to properly describe the dynamics of the system at very low molecule numbers when the discrete nature of molecule number is more important .",
    "the passage time distribution for the photoassociation of fermionic atoms into molecules differs sharply from its counterpart for the reverse process of photodissociation from a molecular condensate into fermionic atom pairs , which is plotted as the dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "in contrast to photoassociation , this latter process suffers significantly reduced fluctuations .",
    "one can gain an intuitive understanding of this difference by treating the short - time molecular population classically , @xmath102 . within this approximation , the heisenberg equations of motion ( [ heisen1])-([heisen2 ] )",

    "when it consists initially solely of molecules , @xmath108 , the initial state is far from the point of unstable equilibrium , and @xmath106 simply `` rolls down '' the potential in a manner largely insensitive to quantum fluctuations .",

    "current experiments , however , generally trap @xmath111 atoms , in which case it is important to properly account for the atomic kinetic energies within the fermi sea .    from the hamiltonian ( [ hamil2 ] ) , we readily obtain the heisenberg equations of motion : @xmath112 where we have defined @xmath113 and @xmath114 . in eq .",

    "in particular , eq . ( [ sigapprx ] ) ignores a contribution linear in @xmath61 and as a consequence @xmath58 increases more slowly in the approximate non - degenerate simulation so that for small @xmath126 it agrees only within @xmath127 with the degenerate model once @xmath128 of the initial population of atom pairs has been converted into molecules .",

    "these simulations illustrate in particular that the formation of molecules is suppressed for increased @xmath126 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that a significant fraction of the atom pairs are detuned from resonance and therefore converted more slowly and incompletely into molecules .",
    "we have shown that the early stages of molecular dimer formation from fermionic atoms are characterized by large fluctuations that reflect the quantum fluctuations in the initial atomic state .",
    "in contrast , the reverse process of dissociation of a condensate of molecular dimers is largely deterministic .",
    "the reason for this asymmetry can be traced to the fact that in contrast to a quantum - degenerate fermionic system , the initial state of the molecular condensate is well described by a mean - field theory , that is , it is largely classical and relatively devoid of quantum fluctuations .    as long as the atom - molecule coupling is dominant , @xmath134 , the kinetic energies are unimportant and a degenerate model can accurately describe the molecule formation .",
    "this is confirmed by our numerical simulations which show that the results of the degenerate model and the full quantum results are indistinguishable for @xmath135 .",
    "small deviations appear for @xmath136 , and the creation of molecules is dramatically suppressed for higher ratios .",
    "future work will extend these considerations to a more realistic multimode description of the association process as well as a more detailed description of the two - body physics , which should in particular include the dressing of molecules by the open channel atomic pairs that is important in feshbach sweeps .",
    "we will also extend our model to the case of fermionic molecules .",
