    "gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) are the brightest transient phenomena in the universe ( the isotropic equivalent of their total energy reaches @xmath5  erg ) . along with actual bursts , variable sources related to them",
    "are also observed in different ranges : radio , infrared , optical , and x - ray .",
    "they are less intensive but powerful enough , with luminosities reaching @xmath6  ergs@xmath7 .",
    "a division of all these manifestations into two types of transients is generally accepted : emission synchronous with gamma - ray ( prompt ) , continuing at least until @xmath8 ( the time till which 90% of the gamma - ray burst energy is released ) , and the afterglows , usually starting after the burst turns off .",
    "the most popular description of their population is a model which combines the inner and outer shock waves produced while the fragments of the relativistic outflow decelerate due to the collisions inside of it ( prompt ) and while it decelerates in the outer interstellar medium ( afterglow )  @xcite .",
    "most of the studies are devoted to examining the properties of individual gamma - ray bursts and to attempts of verification of phenomenon models in general .",
    "as time has shown , in this approach its self - consistent physical picture is far from being constructed , especially for the optical components of the bursts .",
    "it is still unclear whether there occur reverse shock waves , what energy structure does a relativistic jet have , what is the density distribution in the ambient interstellar medium surrounding the burst , etc . in these circumstances ,",
    "the search for statistical relationships between various parameters of bursts in their subsamples formed according to various criteria and with the minimal use of model representations remains a topical task . in its context",
    ", a particularly important role has the analysis of the properties of the sample of gamma - ray bursts with measured redshifts , numbering about 250 objects  @xcite .",
    "this amount of data allows us to perform a statistical analysis of the parameters of gamma - ray bursts in the proper frame of reference , revealing empirical relations between intrinsic physical characteristics  @xcite . at the same time ,",
    "similar relations are also analyzed for the optical components of the bursts  @xcite , the host galaxies  @xcite , and the characteristics of the local interstellar medium in the grb progenitors  @xcite .",
    "the main problem of all such studies is to find an optimum ratio between the object selection criteria and the sample size : the latter decreases for a more rigorous selection , and subsequently the significance of established statistical dependences falls , while the role of selection effects increases .",
    "we study the correlations between the parameters of grbs with measured redshifts and peaked optical light curves .",
    "the latter condition isolates a specific physical condition within any given model : deceleration of either the ejecta colliding inside the jet in the case of prompt optical emissions or the ejected matter in the outer interstellar medium .",
    "notice that it is not known in advance which kind of physical processes would determine the occurrence of this peak .",
    "the division of objects into subsamples was carried out by comparing the time interval between the beginning of the optical brightness increase and the time of the trigger with the duration of the gamma - ray emission itself ( prompt optical emissions , afterglows , and afterglows accompanied by residual gamma - ray radiation ) , while the identification of the physical type of optical emissions ( prompt or afterglow ) stems from the statistical analysis of the entire subsample .",
    "this way , some objects , initially classified as the prompt optical emissions were subsequently found to be close to the afterglows by their statistical properties . notice that the use of a sample of grbs with known redshifts for the statistical analysis allows us to pose the problem of the cosmological evolution of the properties of both the bursts themselves and the interstellar medium in the region of their localization .",
    "section  2 of this paper gives the definitions and techniques of obtaining different characteristics of the objects , and describes the methods of statistical analysis of the initial data and the obtained results .",
    "sections  3 ,  4 ,  5 discuss some of the most important correlations between the grb parameters we found : the relationship between the optical luminosity at the light curve peaks and the redshift , between the optical luminosity and the burst energy in the gamma - ray range , and between the luminosity and the time of the peak .",
    "section  6 briefly summarizes the results obtained .",
    "fifty - four gamma - ray bursts with known redshifts and peaked optical light curves were selected for the analysis .",
    "the time dependences of the detected radiation flux both in the gamma - ray and optical ( in stellar magnitudes ) ranges served as the data sources for determining grb parameters . in the latter case , these are , as a rule , the light curves in the @xmath0  band , @xmath9 , sometimes with modified filters , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , in one case in the @xmath13  band ( grb050730 ) , and in two cases in the white light ( grb100906a and grb080810 ) . with the use of calibrations from  @xcite , spectral flux densities in the respective @xmath14 bands in the observer s reference frame",
    "were found .",
    "the @xmath14 values were converted into the spectral flux densities @xmath15 at the effective @xmath0-band wavelength in the proper frame of reference .",
    "if there were no data on the optical spectral index @xmath16 , @xmath17 , the mean value  @xcite for grb optical components was used , and the following values were determined : the flux in the observer s frame of reference @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the frequency boundaries of a photometric band in the observer s frame of reference ; the integral optical flux @xmath21 ( the result of numerical integration of @xmath22 over time ) ; the time of the optical peak relative to the trigger time of a gamma - ray burst @xmath23 ; the increase and decrease indices of the optical radiation intensity , @xmath24 , .",
    "the parameters of the gamma - ray emission  the peak @xmath25 and integral @xmath26 fluxes in the range of 15350  kev , the time of the release of 90% of the grb energy @xmath27 , and the spectral index of the energy distribution @xmath28were adopted from butler et  al .",
    "table  1 lists the data on the gamma - ray bursts and their parameters in the observer s frame of reference . taking into account the extinction in the galaxy  @xcite , the brightness of the host galaxy ( if available ) , and the extinction in it , the following grb parameters were determined for the standard cosmological model with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , in the proper frame of reference : the maximal optical @xmath0  band luminosity @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the frequency boundaries of the standard @xmath0  band , and @xmath34 is the photometric distance ; the total optical energy @xmath35 for the same range ( the time integral of @xmath36 ) ; the time - related parameters taking into account cosmological contraction .",
    "the isotropic equivalent of the gamma - ray burst energy in the extended range of @xmath37 was adopted from  @xcite , the peak luminosity @xmath38 was derived from @xmath25 as @xmath39    if the extinction @xmath40 in the host galaxy was not measured , then based on the data on @xmath41 for 76  bursts from  @xcite , we determined the average of these values at a corresponding redshift and transformed them into @xmath40 using the model of extinction in the magellanic clouds  @xcite .",
    "the data on the parameters of the gamma - ray bursts in the proper frame of reference are presented in table  2 .",
    "all the optical transients have been classified into one of four following types based on the ratio between the duration of gamma - ray emission itself and the lag of the beginning of the optical brightness increase relative to the time of the trigger .",
    "( prompt ) ; thirteen optical transients are classified here whose brightness begins to increase before the attenuation of gamma - ray radiation .",
    "this type includes four events , referred to as p ? , whose belonging to p is ambiguous ; they may belong to the a(u ) type ( see below ) .",
    "@xmath42 a ( afterglow ) ; 34  transients whose brightness begins to increase after the gamma - ray activity is ended .",
    "@xmath42 a(u ; seven transients whose brightness is increasing in the presence of underlying residual gamma - ray radiation after 90% of the total burst energy is released .",
    "for the statistical analysis , seven samples were formed containing the following types of objects :    \\(1 ) p and p ?- type transients ;    \\(2 ) only afterglows a ;    \\(3 ) only the transients with underlying continuing gamma - ray activity a(u ) ;    \\(4 ) all 54 optical transients ;    \\(5 ) afterglows a and transients with underlying continuing gamma - ray activity a(u ) ;",
    "\\(6 ) only prompt optical emissions p ;    \\(7 ) the a - type transients along with a(u ) and p ? .",
    "unweighted pearson correlation coefficients @xmath0 and their significance levels @xmath43 were determined between all possible pairs of grb parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 from these samples by the formulas @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the average values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath50 is the euler gamma function , @xmath51 is the number of points @xmath52 .",
    "correlations between the parameters with and the significance levels of were assumed to be significant , and the linear regression coefficients were then determined for these parameters ( table  3 ) .",
    "among all the correlation relationships established in this study , the @xmath54 dependence ( fig .  [ fig1:beskin_n ] ) , discovered for the first time , in our opinion presents the greatest interest .",
    "in particular , its presence leads to the concept of probable cosmological evolution of the local interstellar medium in the gamma - ray burst birthplaces .",
    "notice that this correlation is highly significant for all object types except for the p - type sample objects , which is corroborating evidence that transients belong to afterglows ( a and objects , whose characteristics virtually coincide in the discussed correlation ) . to be completely confident that the discovered correlation is real , the possible role of selection effects in its occurrence has to be analyzed .",
    "notice that to determine the effect of selection on the parameters of the bursts in the samples of different types , it is first of all necessary to examine the whole set of brightness estimates for optical companions of the bursts at the time of their discovery . to this end , we built the dependences of the observed magnitudes on @xmath55 of optical companions at the times of their discovery and the light curve peak ( fig .",
    "[ fig2:beskin_n ] ) . based on the data of figs .  1 and  2",
    ", the following conclusions can be formulated .",
    "given a relatively equal luminosity at different redshifts in the proper reference frames , the observed flux should drop quadratically with @xmath55 , and therewith at maximum redshifts reach the typical detection limit at around @xmath56 , estimated in our sample from the total light curves .",
    "this effect would lead to a lack of low - luminosity objects in the proper frame of reference , whose observed brightness is fainter than @xmath57 , and as a consequence , to a luminosity increase with growing redshift .",
    "nevertheless , no regular radiation flux decrease is observed either in the whole set of brightness estimates for optical transients at the moment of their detection or in the peak brightness . on the other hand , both at @xmath58 and",
    "@xmath59 the brightness of objects varies within close limits from @xmath60@xmath61 to @xmath62@xmath63 , by far exceeding the detection limit of @xmath56 . in other words ,",
    "the selection by brightness is absent in our data .",
    "we compared the correlation coefficients and linear regression parameters for the group of transients from the a + a(u ) + p ?",
    "sample , localized in different redshift ranges ( table  4 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that even if we exclude the transients with @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the luminosity increase with increasing redshift remains detectable and significant . clearly , if we narrow the redshift range , the correlation coefficients decrease , but nevertheless the linear regression parameters for different groups of transients remain the same within their errors ; in particular , the exponents are close to 45",
