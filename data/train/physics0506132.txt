    "the cleo ii detector was revolutionary in that it was the first to couple a large magnetic tracking volume with a precision crystal electromagnetic calorimeter capable of measuring photons down to the tens of mev level @xcite .",
    "cleo ii produced many ground - breaking physics results , but was hampered by its limited charged - hadron identification capabilities that were provided by a combination of de / dx and time - of - flight measurements .",
    "the cleo iii detector was designed to study decays of @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks , @xmath3 leptons and @xmath4 mesons produced in @xmath5 collisions near 10 gev center - of - mass energy .",
    "cleo iii is an upgraded version of cleo ii , as the magnet , the calorimeter and the muon system were kept .",
    "it contained a new four - layer silicon strip vertex detector , a new wire drift chamber and a particle identification system based on cherenkov ring imaging described herein .",
    "information about cleo is available elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "design choices for particle identification were limited by radial space and the necessity of minimizing material in front of the csi crystal calorimeter .",
    "the csi imposed a hard radial outer limit , and the desire for maintaining excellent charged particle tracking imposed a radial lower limit , since at high momentum the error in momentum is inversely proportional to the square of the track length .",
    "the particle identification system was allocated only 20  cm of radial space , and this limited the technology choices . to retain the superior performance of the calorimeter , a material thickness of only 12% of a radiation length was allowed .",
    "the cleo iii installation including the rich detector occurred in the summer of 1999 and was used to study physics in the @xmath5 center - of - mass energy region around 9 - 12 gev .",
    "the two - ring machines kekb and pep - ii produced much more luminosity than cesr , and after some excellent initial results on @xmath6 decays and upsilon spectroscopy , it became clear that there was much physics to be explored in charm decays and studies of charmonium . the transformation from cleo iii to cleo - c",
    "was made in 2003 , when the cesr accelerator began operating in the 3 - 5 gev center - of - mass energy region .",
    "the inner double - sided silicon detector was replaced with a wire drift chamber that has significantly less material and is much better suited to the cleo - c physics program ; in any case , the silicon was showing effects of premature radiation damage .",
    "the magnetic field was lowered from 1.5  t to 1  t , mainly for accelerator related considerations .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : the basic rich detector design will be delineated , followed by descriptions of the individual components , namely the crystals , multi - wire chambers , superstructure , readout electronics , and support subsystems .",
    "issues in the long - term operation of the rich are then discussed .",
    "finally , some details of the data analysis technique and physics performance are presented .",
    "the severe radial spatial constraint forces the design to have a thin , few - cm detector for cherenkov photons and a thin radiator . otherwise the photons have too little distance to travel and it becomes very difficult to precisely measure the photon angles .",
    "in fact , the only thin , large - area photon detectors possible in our situation were wire chamber based , either using a reflective csi photocathode or a gas mixture of methane ( ch@xmath7 ) and triethylamine ( tea ) vapor to convert ultraviolet photons .",
    "use of csi would have allowed us to use a liquid freon radiator with quartz windows in the system and to work in the wavelength region from about 160200  nm . however , at the time of decision , the use of csi was far from proven and , in any case , would have imposed severe constraints on the construction process , which would have been both technically difficult and expensive .",

    "lif was chosen over caf@xmath9 or mgf@xmath9 , both of which are transparent in the vuv wavelength region , due to its lower dispersion leading to smaller chromatic error .",
    "originally all the radiators were planned to be 1  cm thick planar pieces . however , since the refractive index of lif at 150  nm is 1.5 , all the cherenkov light generated from tracks normal to the lif surface would be totally internally reflected , as shown in fig .",

    "there were several significant issues in the production of these crystal pieces .",
    "first , the bulk absorption of vuv photons needed to be small , so high purity raw material was required .",
    "second , the surface transmission needed to be appreciable , so high - quality polishing of the surfaces was required .",
    "these two elements are necessary to yield good transmission in the vuv region .",
    "third , the finished plates needed to have large dimensions , so the active area of the detector remained high .",
    "last , they needed to have good mechanical stability ",
    "free of cleaves , nascent cleaves , and geometric shape deformations  so the internal strain in the crystals needed to be minimal .",
    "this was particularly critical for the very thin 2  mm windows , which would cause the photon detector to fail if a crack occurred in situ . in order to meet these stringent requirements a r&d program in the areas of fluoride crystal growth and processing",
    "were undertaken .",
    "fluoride crystals were grown at the optovac facilities @xcite using a modified bridgman - stockbarger method @xcite . in this technique , pure raw powder",
    "is packed in a graphite crucible which is heated in a vacuum furnace to a temperature far above its melting point . after a period of impurity removal",
    ", the crucible is reduced to a temperature just above the melting point , and then slowly lowered mechanically through a sharp thermal gradient into a second volume where the temperature is below the melting point .",
    "this effects a surface of solidification in the melt where the crystal lattice is actually grown .",
    "the resulting solid ingot is then held at a reduced temperature ( roughly half that of the melting point  @xcite ) , at which it is annealed to reduce the bulk strain induced by the growth process as it is slowly brought to room temperature .",
    "the growth process is the most important single step in crystal production , since it not only impacts the manufacturability directly , but the ultimate optical and mechanical properties of the finished crystal as well .",
    "stockbarger recognized from the beginning the critical roles of both the high purity of the raw material and the sharpness of the thermal gradient between the two temperature regions .",
    "this latter impacts the design and operation of the furnace , as does the need for uniformity of temperature in the melt . good control of the crystallization zone allows for low intrinsic strain growth , and for the impurities to segregate to the top of the ingot .",
    "both are necessary for the large - area rich crystals .    the actual temperature levels and durations in the thermal cycle",
    "were determined by repeated experimentation , and varied according to material used and ingot size .",
    "this optimization constituted an important line of development , in particular for the large 14.5 and 16-inch diameter ingots grown for  windows .",
    "the  ingots were grown using a piece of single crystal as a seed , in order to reduce the number of domain boundaries between regions of different crystal orientation .",
    "this was never entirely successful , and all ingots grown were polycrystals .",
    "the raw material used was either very pure grade lif powder synthesized by merck , or crushed natural fluorite ( ) , of sufficient purity for thin windows . in order to remove residual impurities from the fluorite",
    ", 2% pbo@xmath9 was added as a getter that subsequently segregated from the melt .",
    "any residual impurities reduce transmission significantly at 150  nm , since they will either create absorption ( color ) centers or scattering centers for light in the vuv region .    in order to monitor the ingot quality at growth ,",
    "test bars were taken as a vertical slice from the periphery of each ingot .",

    "each of which is a formed piece of crystal ready for polishing in order to have good optical transmission . to produce the blanks ,",
    "the ingot is first mounted on a plaster base and sliced to approximate thickness on a band - saw using a diamond blade and a gravity - feed table .",
    "it is important to use a  well - cutting blade , \" to thermalize the ingot and lubricant to room temperature , and to establish the proper feed rate of the blade through the ingot .",
    "next , the slice is trimmed to approximate shape , and all edges are bevelled by hand .",
    "then , the two faces of the slice are ground to within @xmath8150  of final thickness , using a blanchard - type surface grinder with fine - grit superabrasive pellets .",
    "finally , the four edges of the piece are ground to dimension using a sx cnc machine with a very fine diamond superabrasive wheel .",
    "the lif radiators have two edges which are given a 6@xmath17 angle .",
    "for the case of windows and planar radiators , the blank is now finished and ready for polishing . for the case of sawtooth radiators , additional grinding steps ( as well as a different polishing technique )",
    "are required , as described below .",
    "the machining process is developed by determining the proper speeds and feed rates for each operation . otherwise the crystal may be easily destroyed .",
    "nevertheless , each of these machining steps does introduce some actual damage to the crystal .",
    "this consists of microscopic cleaves and irregularities at the surface and just below it , called `` subsurface damage . ''",
    "the goal of each step in the machining process is to cut away enough material so as to get under the subsurface damage created by the previous step , while itself creating at worst only a finer level of damage , which is to be removed by the subsequent operation . in this way , a piece of sufficient transmission is ultimately produced .",
    "the polishing process consisted of placing a blank on a lapping table with a polyurethane polishing pad and a specific polishing media , such as fine - grit diamond powder suspended in glycol or a commercially - available polishing slurry .",

    "the effectiveness of different polishing times and weights was extensively studied .",

    "the early stages of the crystal production saw a very low yield of pieces .",
    "it was only after intense efforts developing all phases of production ( growth , machining and polishing ) that the yields grew to acceptable levels .    for  production , the intrinsic strain in the thin large - area windows needed to be minimized .",
    "optimization of the annealing cycle , major improvements to the machining process , and determination of proper weighting during polishing , gave rise to increased yields .",
    "the manufacturing yield of an ingot ( i.e. , the number of windows produced divided by the number possible in an ingot ) grew from below 30% in the initial phases of the project to be routinely above 80% , and as high as 90% . in the wake of these improvements ,",

    "both , the monochromator and the vacuum vessel , are evacuated by dedicated turbomolecular vacuum pumps to minimize absorption of the probe radiation by any residual air or water molecules . a photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) , whose front window is coated with an ultraviolet wave - shifting compound ( sodium salicylate  @xcite ) , is attached to the vacuum vessel and measures the intensity of the transmitted vuv light from the monochromator after its passage through the crystal .",
