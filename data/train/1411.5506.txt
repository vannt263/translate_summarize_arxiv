    "double beta decay is the most rare nuclear process measured so far which presents a great interest , especially for testing the lepton number conservation ( lnc ) and understanding the neutrino properties . within",
    "the standard model ( sm ) it conserves the lepton number and can occur through several decay modes , with emission of two neutrinos / anti - neutrinos ( @xmath5 ) in the final states .",
    "however , theories beyond sm predict that this process may also occur without conservation of the lepton number , and hence , without emission of neutrinos / anti - neutrinos , through the so called neutrinoless ( @xmath6 ) decay modes . according with the number and type of leptons we may have the following dbd modes :",

    "complete information about the achievements in the study of dbd can be found in several recent excellent reviews @xcite- @xcite , which also contain a comprehensive list of references in domain .",
    "the lifetimes for the dbd modes can be factorized , in good a approximation , as follows :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 are the psf and @xmath17 the nuclear matrix elements ( nme ) for the @xmath5 , @xmath6 decay modes respectively , and @xmath18 is a beyond sm parameter which contains information about the neutrino properties in the ( most common ) hypothesis that the @xmath6 @xmath19 decay ( dbd ) occurs through the neutrino exchange mechanism .",
    "as seen , psf and nme are key quantities for estimating / predicting dbd lifetimes and/or for deriving neutrino properties , hence it is important to calculate them with high accuracy .",
    "moreover , the psf values largely fix the order of magnitude of the dbd lifetimes .",
    "so far , much effort has been and is still devoted to the precise calculation of the nme @xcite-@xcite , while psf have been less discussed because it was considered that they were computed with enough precision @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently , the psf were recalculated with a more rigorous method , by using exact electron dirac wave functions ( w.f . ) and taking into account the finite nuclear size and electron screening effects @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the authors found differences between their results and those calculated previously with approximate electron w.f .",
    ", especially for heavier nuclei and for @xmath1 decay modes .",
    "this justifies a more careful independent re - evaluation of the psf involved in dbd , using more accurate methods .",
    "the purpose of this work is to give a complete , up - date list of the psf values for the i)-vii ) dbd modes mentioned above , in all nuclei of interest and possible transitions to final states .",
    "the decay mode @xmath14 can not occur to the order of approximation that is presently considered in the literature .",
    "we developed high precision routines to compute the relativistic ( dirac ) electron w.f .",
    "taking into account the nuclear finite size and screening effects .",
    "in addition to the previous calculations , we use a coulomb potential derived from a realistic proton density distribution in nucleus , improve the precision of the numerical routines used to solve the dirac equations and integrate the psf expressions , and use @xmath4-values reported recently @xcite .",
    "these ingredients proved to be important , leading in many cases to significant corrections to the present available psf values , which are discussed as well .",
    "accurate psf values ( besides the nme ) are necessary ingredients both for theorists to improve the dbd lifetime predictions and constraint the neutrino parameters , and for experimentalists to plan their set - ups .",
    "to compute psf for dbd decay modes we need first to obtain the w.f . of the electron(s)/positron(s ) emitted or electron(s ) captured in the decay , which are distorted by the coulomb potential of the nucleus",
    "older calculations have used a non - relativistic approach where the distortion of the w.f . by the coulomb field",
    "was considered through fermi ( coulomb ) factors obtained ( for the emitted particles ) by taking the square of the ratio of the schrdinger scattering solution for a point charge @xmath20 to a plane wave , evaluated at the origin @xcite-@xcite . in a better approximation",
    ", the fermi factors are calculated using a relativistic treatment of the electron / positron w.f , but with approximate dirac functions ( the fermi factor is defined as the square of the ratio of the values of the dirac w.f . of the electron at the nuclear surface ) and without the inclusion of screening effects @xcite .",
    "recently , kotila and iachello ( ki ) recalculated the psf using exact dirac electron / positron w.f . and including the screening effect @xcite-@xcite .",

    "these additional ingredients lead in many cases to differences as compared with ki s results , that we qualitatively discuss in the following . for the @xmath0 decay mode our results are in good agreement with ki s",

    "ki have not reported psf values . comparing our psf values with older results @xcite , @xcite , we found differences in the range ( 17 - 86)% , for both @xmath140 and @xmath163 , unless @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath164 where our results are several times larger . for the @xmath1 decay modes our psf values are in agreement with ki s results within ( 3 - 12)% for @xmath140 and within ( 6 - 23)% for @xmath163 . for @xmath2 decay mode",

    "it is worth to mention that we got significant differences as compared with ki s results especially for the decays where the @xmath4-values are small . in these cases the numerical precision in the psf integration is important and must be treated carefully .",
    "the use of a realistic coulomb potential can also lead to differences between ki and our results , especially for double - positron emitting and/or positron emitting electron(s ) captured decays . the use of recently reported @xmath4 values @xcite may bring other differences between our results and previous ones . for example , we first computed the psf with the same @xmath4-values used by ki and then with the @xmath4-values taken from @xcite and got differences of ( 3 - 4)% between the two sets of results .",
    "we mention that , in our opinion , differences of 10% or more in the psf values are significant for precise dbd calculations / estimations , hence the evaluation of the psf for many dbd decay modes and/or transitions is still a challenge and it is necessary to investigate it thoroughly .",

    "<S> in addition to the previous calculations we use a coulomb potential derived from a realistic proton density distribution in nucleus , improve the precision of the numerical routines used to solve the dirac equations and to integrate the psf expressions , and use recently reported @xmath4-values . these ingredients proved to be important , leading in many cases to significant differences as compared to the present available psf values , which are discussed as well . </S>",
    "<S> accurate values of the psf are necessary ingredients both for theorists , to improve the dbd lifetime predictions and constraint the neutrino parameters , and for experimentalists to plan their set - ups . </S>"
