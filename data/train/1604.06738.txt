    "coupled fluid - solid interaction ( fsi ) problems are in general complex . they require advanced computational methods to handle them . various studies have previously investigated the vibration of structures while interacting with a surrounding acoustic medium @xcite .",
    "experimental investigations were also conducted on lightweight aerospace structures to estimate their acoustic radiation damping under a wide band of frequency excitations @xcite . during this interaction , the structure",
    "s energy is continuously radiated into the surrounding fluid medium , resulting in a damped structure s response . in @xcite , a general expression for the total loss factor exhibited in the vibration of a solid body when immersed in a fluid medium",
    "is given as @xmath0 the total loss factor @xmath1 , consists of three components : the structural loss factor @xmath2 , which represents damping associated with the intrinsic material properties of the structure ( e.g. , viscoelasticity ) , the aerodynamic loss factor @xmath3 , which is due to the presence of a non - zero mean flow over the structure , and finally , the radiation loss factor @xmath4 , the focus of our work , which results from the radiation of sound as a consequence of the structure s vibration . suppressing the structural loss by assuming a non - dissipative material model and eliminating the aerodynamic loss by considering a perturbing flow in a quiescent fluid medium ,",
    "the acoustic radiation becomes the sole source of damping pertaining to the problem . obviously , when the structure is vibrating in vacuum , no acoustic radiation loss is encountered and thus , @xmath5 . in many situations ,",
    "acoustic radiation effects can be reasonably neglected ; however , in some cases , particularly for thin lightweight structures , acoustic damping can be an order of magnitude higher than its structural counterpart @xcite .",
    "the major objective of this research is to formulate and validate a closed - form expression for the acoustic radiation damping factor ( @xmath4 ) revealing its dependence on the physical parameters of the coupled problem .",
    "the development of this mathematical expression constitutes the real novelty of our work since no such evaluation has been conducted in previous acoustic radiation damping investigations .    the generalized acoustic - structure interaction problem , whose schematic layout is shown in figure [ schematiclayout ] , is comprised of a solid medium @xmath6 that is wholly immersed in an acoustic medium @xmath7 . for our work",
    ", we adopt the simplest possible models for both @xmath6 and @xmath7 in hope of making analytical solutions feasible .",
    "therefore , the small - strain hookean model whose elastodynamics is governed by the navier equation @xcite , and the inviscid compressible fluid in which the acoustic wave propagation is described by the well - known wave equation @xcite , are applied in @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "the two media have a common interface @xmath8 on which essential boundary conditions ( bc ) are maintained to complete the problem s description . as a physical constraint",
    ", no interpenetration is allowed through @xmath8 , thus the normal displacement of the structural medium must equate its fluid counterpart ; this ensures a continuous displacement field throughout .",
    "in addition , the equilibrium on the common surface requires balancing the solid normal traction to the acoustic pressure .",
    "finally , at the infinite boundary @xmath9 , the non - reflection ( wave absorption ) condition is applied to emulate the absence of any reflecting surface within the acoustic medium at far field . in summary ,",
    "the governing equations that constitute the mathematical core of the general coupled problem are presented as follows    [ gov_fsi_eqs ] @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14    where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are respectively the young s modulus , poisson s ratio , and mass density of the solid medium , while @xmath18 and @xmath19 are respectively the celerity of sound and mass density corresponding to the acoustic medium",
    ". the above model was applied in @xcite where an fsi problem is solved computationally .",
    "the unknowns of eq .",
    "are , to a great importance , the solid displacement @xmath20 , and less importantly , the acoustic pressure @xmath21 .    in our work",
    ", we analytically solve the elastodynamic - acoustic interaction problem described by eq .",
    "for two structures : the thin spherical shell and the solid sphere . in both problems ,",
    "the exact solutions for both displacement and pressure fields are presented .",
    "consequently , acoustic damping is demonstrated and the damping factor expression is derived from the frequency domain solution . as for validation , the effects of the media properties , problem geometry , and modal",
    "wavenumbers are highlighted through the damping extraction algorithms applied on transient solutions .    in previous works ,",
    "the acoustic - structure interaction problem was considered in the framework where the dynamics is triggered by an external source of excitation ( e.g. , applied step load on the structure as in @xcite or pressure pulse in the acoustic medium as in @xcite ) . in addition , the work presented in @xcite predicts the acoustic radiation damping of flexible panels where the discrepancy in results corresponding to the uniform / nonuniform pressure theories is revealed .",
    "more interestingly , the work of @xcite treats a spherical structure problem ; nevertheless , the approach in solving the problem relies on considering a potential flow in the acoustic part , leading to a rather challenging differential functional equation that was never solved . as a result ,",
    "no rigorous mathematical expression for the acoustic damping could be produced .",
    "the distinction of our work lies in considering the situation of self - excitation , where the initially deformed structure is the sole source of energy pertaining to the coupled system .",
    "in such a case , the structure s response has no choice but to decay continuously with time due to the lack of any external energy feed that could compensate for the radiated acoustic energy . in consequence , under self - excitation",
    ", the coupled system reveals its _ intrinsic _ damping characteristics allowing for a direct correlation between the natural response and the acoustic damping behaviour to be established .",
    "the paper first briefly overviews the applied damping extraction methods associated with the transient analysis of the linear under - damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "next , we analyse the thin shell problem , which is characterized by its mathematical simplicity with regard to solution formulation and damping estimation .",
    "then , we discuss the more challenging solid sphere problem in which we present the radial mode of oscillation and its corresponding energy calculations , to later solve the coupled problem and verify the damping expression .",
    "finally , we conduct a qualitative comparison between the radiation damping resistances of our problems and those of some previously analysed problems , to draw meaningful conclusions about general acoustic damping estimation .",
    "the coupled elastodynamic - acoustic problem is linear as depicted in eq .",
    ", therefore , the damping behaviour of the coupled system is expected to mimic that of the simplest linear dynamic model : the ideal under - damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "this model is widely explored in @xcite and in other references .",
    "its natural vibration is governed by @xmath22 which admits a normalized displacement solution @xmath23 given by @xmath24\\ ] ] the total energy stored in the system , @xmath25 , is the sum of kinetic and potential energies . it is expressed in normalized form as @xmath26 \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the the damped frequency @xmath27 is defined as @xmath28    in account of the above analysis , mathematical procedures for evaluating the damping property of a dynamic system are established .",
    "the log decrement method explained in @xcite , is a statistical algorithm that extracts a characteristic damping ratio from the transient response , portraying the intrinsic dissipation of a damped oscillator .",
    "mathematically , for a typical under - damped oscillatory displacement response , consistent with eq .   and shown in fig .",
    "[ disp_response ] , the algorithm predicts an average displacement - based damping ratio , @xmath29 , computed as follows @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the @xmath32th extremum value of @xmath23 , and @xmath33 is the total number of all successive extrema used in the evaluation . for the algorithm to generate a meaningful damping ratio , the displacement peak values must steadily decay with time , i.e. @xmath34 for all @xmath32 . in some cases",
    ", this condition fails ( as will be shown in the solid sphere problem ) , rendering the displacement - based log decrement method erroneous . by necessity to overcome this failure , we extend the applicability of the log decrement method into the energy response , and a corresponding energy - based algorithm is developed . considering the energy response expressed in eq .   and",
    "plotted in figure [ energy_response ] , we observe a non - increasing or `` staircase '' behaviour that is typical for this type of dynamic systems .",
    "the interesting points to consider for this algorithm are those where the response flats out , i.e. inflection points on which the first and second time derivatives vanish .",
    "the average energy - based damping ratio , @xmath35 , can be evaluated using the following formula @xmath36 this algorithm requires the identification of @xmath33 consecutive inflection points @xmath37 , the first one occurs at initial time .",
    "the obvious condition for the algorithm s success is the steady decay of energy , i.e. @xmath38 for all @xmath32 , and this is always satisfied for a damped system subject to natural excitations .",
    "hence , the energy - based log decrement method supersedes its displacement - based counterpart by possessing an unrestricted applicability .",
    "in addition to damping extraction procedures based on transient analysis , methods based on the frequency ( laplace ) response are applied in this work too . since our analysis",
    "is primarily conducted in the frequency domain , the frequency - based damping extraction method generates a meaningful estimate for the damping ratio bypassing all errors involved in the laplace transform inversion .",
    "in addition , this method expresses the damping ratio in closed form by explicitly revealing its physical dependence on the problem s governing parameters . in comparison , the log decrement method simply provides a `` numerical '' value for the damping ratio without unveiling its mathematical structure . in our work , we achieve the damping characterization by first applying the frequency - based method to obtain the closed - form expression of the damping ratio , and then verifying it through log - decrement methods . the mathematical procedure of the frequency method is presented as follows .",
    "the laplace form of @xmath23 is expressed as @xmath39 the bode plot of this expression is shown in fig .",
    "[ freq_resp_har_osci ] .",
    "the response peaks near the natural frequency where    @xmath40    @xmath41    inverting eq .   to solve for @xmath42",
    ", we obtain @xmath43 the above equations are simplified from a more complex form where an approximation for small @xmath42 is appreciated .",
    "acoustic radiation problems are in general lightly damped ; thus the approximation is valid and the analysis is accurate .",
    "in this section , we present the first and simplest coupled problem : radial pulsation of a thin spherical shell . consider the elastic thin spherical shell of mean radius @xmath44 and thickness @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "the shell s inner core is void and its center resides on the origin of the spherical coordinate system .",
    "the spherical symmetry is achieved by considering a uniform and wholly radial displacement field throughout the shell surface , thus @xmath47 .",
    "this symmetry extends to the surrounding acoustic part , where @xmath21 spatially depends on the radial distance only , i.e. @xmath48 .",
    "initially , the acoustic medium is quiescent and the shell is deformed by @xmath49 .",
    "the governing simplified elastodynamic equation describing the radial oscillation of the shell under this prescription is given as ( also applied in @xcite ) @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the uniform acoustic pressure applied on the shell s outer surface , i.e. @xmath52 . the structural wave speed is defined as @xmath53 on the acoustic side , the acoustic wave equation ( dalembertian form ) expressed in spherical coordinates reduces to @xmath54 on the shell surface , the no - interpenetration condition for small shell radial displacement is expressed as @xmath55 and finally , at far field , the sommerfeld radiation condition becomes @xmath56 mathematically , equations , , , and describe the coupled problem .",
    "the inversion into the laplace domain is applied to solve for the shell s response . when the wave equation is transformed into the laplace domain",
    ", we obtain the @xmath57 order spherical bessel equation in @xmath58 admitting the spherical hankel functions of first and second kind as fundamental solutions .",
    "thus @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are determined by applying the necessary bc and @xmath62 . for the sommerfeld condition in to be satisfied , the first kind hankel function @xmath63 must not appear in the pressure general solution , this is achieved by setting @xmath64 .",
    "the reader is advised to review appendix a.4 of @xcite or the appendix of @xcite to better understand the asymptotic behaviour of hankel functions and their derivatives . substituting for @xmath65 and its derivative in the laplace versions of eq .",
    "and eq .",
    "and then taking the ratio of these two equations to eliminate @xmath61 , we obtain an expression for @xmath66 given by @xmath67 if we normalize the displacement with @xmath49 , time with @xmath68 and consequently the frequency ( and laplace variable , @xmath69 ) with @xmath70 , the above expression in normalized form becomes @xmath71 where @xmath72 is defined as @xmath73 applying the frequency method to extract the damping expression @xmath74 , we obtain @xmath75 in real applications , both @xmath76 and @xmath77 , thus @xmath72 constitutes a first order approximation for @xmath74 .",
    "note that @xmath72 is inversely proportional to @xmath17 and @xmath45 , confirming that acoustic damping intensifies for thin lightweight structures .    substituting the expression of @xmath66 into the laplace form of eq .   to solve for @xmath61 , the acoustic pressure ( which can be normalized by the characteristic pressure @xmath78 )",
    "is then obtained as follows @xmath79}{s^3 + s^2(\\frac{\\vartheta_\\textnormal{a}}{\\vartheta_\\textnormal{s } } + 2\\zeta_0 ) + s + \\frac{\\vartheta_\\textnormal{a}}{\\vartheta_\\textnormal{s}}}\\ ] ] note that both pressure and displacement solutions possess the same characteristic equation ( denominator of their laplace form ) , thus they exhibit the same dynamic behaviour , in particular , damping behaviour .",
    "the laplace inversion of the displacement and pressure expressions into the time domain is performed via the method of partial fractions ( consult chapter 1 of @xcite and appendix b.2 of @xcite for understanding the inversion technique ) .",
    "plots of the displacement and pressure solutions are shown in fig .",
    "[ shell_displacement_plot ] and fig .",
    "[ shell_pressure_plot ] respectively .",
    "concerning the pressure response , we mark two observations . first , a period of silence i.e. @xmath80 occurs everywhere in the acoustic domain ; its duration increases linearly with the distance from the shell s surface according to @xmath81 second , the maximum amplitude of the acoustic pressure , being inversely proportional to the radial distance , decays as we move away from the shell s surface to eventually become zero at infinity .",
    "the displacement simulations are conducted at fixed density ratio @xmath82 and fixed geometry @xmath83 , but variable wave speed ratio @xmath84 0.1 , 0.2 , and 0.4 resulting in three different values for @xmath72 and consequently , three cases 1 , 2 , and 3 respectively .",
    "it is shown that as the ratio @xmath85 decreases , the relative error between the transient damping value ( obtained by log decrement method ) and the closed form value ( obtained by frequency method ) decreases , and both values approach @xmath72 corroborating the validity of the asymptotic expression of eq .   at low ratio of wave speeds .",
    "the results of the three cases are presented in table  [ shell_table ] .",
    "[ shell_table ]    .results of the damping factors ( in @xmath86 ) for all three cases .",

    "in this section , we conduct a qualitative comparison with regard to acoustic damping characteristics between the coupled systems discussed in this paper and some other previously analysed ones .",
    "indeed , a significant resemblance is noticed between the findings , validating the analysis performed in this work and corroborating the dependence of acoustic damping on the physical properties of the coupled system .",
    "the key parameter on which the following analysis is centred is the acoustic radiation resistance @xmath87 , which is nothing but the equivalent of the damper in the under - damped harmonic oscillator .    in @xcite , an expression for the acoustic radiation resistance of a one - sided flat plate subject to excitation at frequency @xmath88 higher than a certain critical frequency @xmath89 ,",
    "is given by @xmath90 for our problems , the radiation resistance is obtained through the following evaluation @xmath91 applying eq .   on the spherical systems , we obtain after simplifying the expressions of @xmath42 by suppressing higher order terms    @xmath92    @xmath93    where @xmath94 is the surface area in contact with the acoustic medium .",
    "the direct dependence of the resistance value on the @xmath95 factor is noticed in the spherical problems as is the case with the flat plate one . as such",
    ", we conjecture that acoustic damping in both natural and forced excitations for general structures is dominated by this factor . for the case of forced excitations ,",
    "frequency effects arise but can be lumped in a secondary proportionality factor as shown in eq .  .",
    "acoustic damping is demonstrated in ideal spherical structural - acoustic models and an analytical expression for this damping is formulated and verified .",
    "the under - damped linear harmonic oscillator accurately depicts the energy dissipation in the coupled system .",
    "the matching of damping coefficients obtained by various damping extraction methods corroborates the accuracy of the analysis .",
    "the availability of analytical solutions in both solid and acoustic domains permits the efficient validation of expensive fsi simulations while considering a single problem .",
    "finally , the future trend of this work is portrayed in two courses ; first is the exploration of the modal superposition effects on acoustic damping , and second is the prediction of the coupled system forced response when subject to both acoustic and structural loading .",
