    "large blank - field scuba surveys have revolutionized our understanding of the importance and diverse nature of dusty galaxies at high redshifts ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "only about 300 blank - field scuba galaxies have been discovered since the instrument was commissioned , in contrast to the tens of thousands to millions of objects detected in optical surveys of similar sizes . nevertheless , the number counts have been well - characterised , and progress is being made in identifying scuba galaxies with objects in other wavebands using source positions derived from radio identifications .",
    "however , the fact remains that scuba sources are difficult to find , and when they _ are _ detected they typically have low signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) , bringing into question the reliability of measurements .",
    "using deep radio imaging of the 8-mjy survey fields , @xcite have suggested that low snr sources in relatively noisy regions of submillimetre maps which lack radio counterparts are often spurious . additional evidence that these sources might be spurious comes from the lack of mambo ( max planck millimeter bolometer array ) counterparts to many of these scuba sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite also report not recovering a similar fraction of low snr sources in the 8-mjy survey region when combined with newer shades ( scuba half degree extragalactic survey ) data in the same field .",
    "only one region , namely the hubble deep field ( hdf ) region or goods - north field , has been investigated independently by different groups .",
    "reassuringly , @xcite and @xcite are in close agreement for the higher snr sources in that region",
    ". however , there is some disagreement regarding the reality and the flux densities of several of the noisier sources .",
    "the effects of flux boosting ( sometimes called malmquist and/or eddington bias ) are well known for snr - thresholded maps , and it is worthwhile to investigate whether such discrepancies are to be expected , and when one should be confident about the reality of a source , _ independent _ of whether it has a radio identification .",
    "it is clear that a careful , un - biased analysis of the robustness of scuba detections in shallow maps is called for . in this vein",
    "we provide a careful estimate of flux boosting and have followed up in photometry mode 5 sources detected in a shallow @xmath0 map of the groth strip , in an attempt to quantify the amount of flux boosting present in the map . to interpret the results we have developed a general method to assess the reliability of low snr sources .",
    "we apply these techniques to a particular scuba survey in the ` groth strip ' .",
    "the ` groth strip survey ' ( gss ) is a _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) programme ( gto 5090 , pi : groth ) consisting of 28 overlapping _",
    "hst _ wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) medium - deep images , covering an area of @xmath9 , forming a long strip centred on ra=@xmath10 , dec=@xmath11 ( j2000 ) , at a galactic latitude of @xmath12 .",
    "the gss was the deepest _ hst _ cosmological integration before the hdf , reaching a limiting vega magnitude of @xmath1328 in both the _ v _ and _ i _ bands @xcite .",
    "the gss has an enormous legacy value , since extensive multi - wavelength observations centred on this region have been conducted or are planned .",
    "morphological and photometric information from the wfpc2 images are provided by the medium deep survey ( mds ) database @xcite and the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe ( deep ) survey @xcite .",
    "x - ray sources have also been identified in an @xmath14 _ xmm - newton _ observation of the gss @xcite .",
    "the gss is currently part of the on - going deep2 survey and is also targetted to be a major component of upcoming large surveys in the uv ( using the galaxy evolution explorer , galex ) , in the optical ( as part of the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey , cfhtls ) , and in the ir ( the _ spitzer _ gto irac deep survey ) .    in this paper , we present @xmath0 scuba observations of about 60 per cent of the original wfpc2 coverage of the gss .",
    "we have also performed confirmation photometry on some of the sources .",
    "our goal is to make the @xmath0 map and source list available to the community so that it may be correlated against existing and future data sets at other wavelengths .",
    "no claim is made that this survey is either the deepest or the most extensive performed using scuba .",
    "however , the observations cover enough integration time that we expect a handful of real sources to be detected , and our survey represents the best submillimetre data likely to be available in this field until the advent of scuba-2 .",
    "a roughly @xmath15 portion of the groth strip ( gss ) was observed with a resolution of 14.7 arcsec and 7.5 arcsec at 850 and @xmath16 , respectively , with the 15-m jcmt atop mauna kea in hawaii in january 1999 and january 2000 .",
    "the gss scuba map is centred on ra@xmath17 , dec@xmath18 ( j2000 ) .",
    "52 overlapping 64-point jiggle maps of the gss were obtained , providing measurements of the continuum at both wavelengths simultaneously with scuba @xcite , which has a field of view of 2.3 arcmin .",
    "the atmospheric zenith opacity at @xmath19 was monitored with the caltech submillimetre observatory ( cso ) tau ( @xmath20 ) monitor .",
    "the @xmath20 ranged from 0.03 to 0.09 in january 1999 and from 0.05 to 0.08 in january 2000 .",
    "the weather was generally more stable for the latter set of data .",
    "the secondary mirror was chopped at a standard frequency of @xmath21 in azimuth to reduce the effect of rapid sky variations .",
    "the telescope was also ` nodded ' on and off the source .",
    "a 40 arcsec chop ",
    "throw was used at a position angle of @xmath22 , almost parallel to the lengthwise orientation of the strip .",
    "pointing checks were performed hourly on blazars and planets and varied by less than 3 arcsec in azimuth and by less than 2 arcsec in elevation .",
    "the overlapping jiggle maps were co - added to produce a final map with a total integration time of 18 hours and 50 minutes .",
    "we used surf ( scuba user reduction facility ; @xcite ) scripts together with locally developed code @xcite to reduce the data .",
    "the surf map and our map look similar .",
    "the benefit of using our own code to analyse the data is that it makes a map with minimally correlated pixels and provides an estimate of the noise in each pixel .",
    "we chose 3 arcsec pixels oriented along ra , dec coordinates .",
    "this pixel size is slightly too large for @xmath16 studies , but has proven to be adequate at @xmath0 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "calibration data were reduced in the same way as the gss data .",
    "the flux conversion factors ( fcfs ) over 3 of the 4 nights in january 1999 and all 3 nights in january 2000 agree with the monthly averages to within 10 per cent ( see the jcmt calibration web - page ) .",
    "the fcf value for one night in january was 30 per cent higher than the monthly average and this could indicate that the sky was so variable that the @xmath23 was not accurately reflecting the opacity along the line of sight to the object .",
    "the calibration uncertainty is omitted from our quoted error values since it is not a major contributor to the global uncertainty of our low snr data and has no effect on our source detection method .",
    "the @xmath0 map has a mean consistent with zero , as expected from differential measurements , and an rms of @xmath24 .",
    "the final map is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:850map ] .",
    "the @xmath16 map also has a mean consistent with zero and an rms of @xmath25 .",
    "given the 14.7 arcsec beam , a high - redshift galaxy will be unresolved and will appear as a positive source flanked by 2 negative sources . the source density at @xmath0",
    "( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) suggests that only a handful of sources will be recovered in our map .",
    "hence we do not expect many overlapping sources , and therefore sources were extracted by fitting the raw rebinned map with a three - lobed psf of an isolated point - source with the same chop throw and position angle as the map data .",
    "a fit to the psf model centred on each pixel is equivalent to a noise - weighted convolution and is the minimum variance estimator if the background consists of white noise .",
    "an accompanying weighted noise map is created simultaneously and provides an estimate of the noise associated with the detection of a point source in each pixel .",
    "a peak in the psf - convolved map which is 3 times the noise in that pixel constitutes a @xmath26 detected point source .",
    "for a list of sources found above a given significance level in a map to be useful , one must address the following questions : ` are there any statistical anomalies in the data which would cause one to doubt any of the sources ? ' ; ` given our actual noise and measurement strategy , what fraction of sources present at any given flux level would we expect to detect ? ' , that is , ` how complete is our source list ? ' ; and finally , ` do the fluxes inferred from the maps form a biased estimator of actual source flux ? ' bias and flux boosting are addressed in @xmath27 .",
    "quality of fit and completeness are addressed here .",
    "we investigate source robustness using several techniques , including spatial and temporal @xmath28 tests , searching for negative sources , and monte carlo simulations .",
    "although a candidate source may be ` detected ' in the map , it may not necessarily be well - fit by the psf , or it may be a poor fit to the set of difference data , or both .",
    "we have performed spatial and temporal @xmath28 tests in order to determine how well the raw timestream data fit the final psf - fitted maps .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "the spatial @xmath28 test provides a gauge across the map of the goodness - of - fit of the triple - beam differential psf to the data , and thus indicates if a source is poorly fit by the assumed psf .",
    "we find that the @xmath28 values for each pixel where a source is detected are within @xmath29 ( = @xmath30 ) , where @xmath31 is the of number degrees of freedom or number of pixels included in the fit ) in all cases , except for gss850.3 , a candidate source with snr=3.3 .",
    "the poor fit may be the result of its proximity to gss850.4 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:850map ] ) .",
    "the temporal @xmath28 provides a measure of the self - consistency of the raw timestream data which contribute flux to each map pixel .",
    "for example , a portion of the hits on a pixel might be consistent with a certain flux value , whereas the rest of the hits might be most consistent with a different value . following the prescription of @xcite , we calculate the pixel temporal @xmath32 and the number of hits for each pixel @xmath33 .",
    "we then essentially construct a snr map of poorness - of - fit to the model by using the quantity @xmath34 as the ` signal ' and @xmath35 as the ` noise ' and fitting the psf to this temporal @xmath28 map .",
    "we find that none of the pixels at the centres of our candidate sources lie outside the @xmath36 regions of our distribution .",
    "we are therefore confident that all of our candidate sources lie in regions of the map with self - consistent timestream data and have no grounds to reject any of our detected candidate sources based on these tests .",
    "note that these two tests also check for gaussianity of the noise in the map , but they are not a strong test of this distribution .",
    "a quick test of source reality is to create the negative of the map and to search for sources using the same triple - beam template . aside from pixels associated with the off - beams of positive detections , we find 6 ` detections ' in the inverted map , consistent with the expected number of false positive detections in noisy data ( see @xmath37 ) .",
    "simulations are required in order to evaluate map completeness and the likely rate of false positive detections , given our non - uniform noise .",
    "we follow the procedures described in @xcite for investigating the number of positive sources expected at random , as well as the map completeness . in order to determine how many detections may be spurious",
    ", we created a map with the same shape and size as the real one , but replaced the @xmath0 data with gaussian random noise , generated using the rms of the timestream of each file and each bolometer .",
    "we then performed the same source detection procedure that was used on the real data .",
    "we repeated this sequence of steps 1000 times and plot the cumulative number of positive sources detected on average in fig .",
    "[ fig : fake ] at each snr threshold .",
    "the simulations suggest that on average one expects 1.6 false positive sources @xmath38 and a further 4.5 between 3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the completeness of a map is the fraction of sources which one expects to detect at each flux level . to measure this fraction",
    ", we added a source of known flux into the real map and tried to extract it using our source extraction method .",
    "we selected the input source flux randomly in the range 3@xmath39 , located it uniformly across the map , and repeated this procedure 1000 times .",
    "a source is considered recovered if it is detected with @xmath40 and located within 7.5 arcsec ( the @xmath0 beam hwhm ) of the input position .",
    "we estimate that about 60 per cent of the @xmath41 sources are detected above a snr of @xmath26 in the map ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sims ] ) .",
    "the completeness is slightly higher than it would be in a map with uniform noise at the same rms , as expected .",
    "we detect 4 candidate sources with @xmath42 and 7 candidate sources with snrs in the range 3.0@xmath4 . a submillimetre image of the gss is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:850map ] , where we number each of these 11 candidates , while in table  [ tab : sources ] we present information on the 5 sources for which we performed follow - up photometry ( see @xmath43 ) .",
    "the signal and noise maps may be downloaded from http://cmbr.physics.ubc.ca/groth .    .gss",
    "@xmath0 candidate submillimetre sources with follow - up photometry .",
    "locations of these and the other 6 candidate scuba sources are indicated in fig  [ fig:850map].[tab : sources ] [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     our revised source list now includes 2 confirmed sources ( with coordinates given in table  [ tab : confirmedsources ] ) as well as 1 other candidate which is @xmath38 in the map . although not confirmed by photometry , figs .",
    "[ fig : fake ] and  [ fig : boost ] suggest that snr @xmath44 sources have a reasonable chance of being real .",
    "we are able to calculate a best estimate of the flux for each of these objects using the combination of all available information , including the map measurements , photometry measurements and the source count prior . to do this we multiply the measured ( assumed gaussian ) photometry flux probability distribution , @xmath45 , by the calculated posterior probability for the map flux ( equation ( [ eqn : pd ] ) ) , which we take as the prior distribution for @xmath46 , and we normalise it to have unit integral .",
    "for the candidate source , gss850.4 , we only know the a posteriori distribution for the map measurement , since we do not have a photometry measurement for this object . in table",
    "[ tab : confirmedsources ] we give the peak of these new distributions , along with the error bars describing the 68 per cent confidence regions .",
    "we now use our new candidate source list ( see table  [ tab : confirmedsources ] ) to search for close counterparts at other wavelengths in other data sets which overlap with our coverage .",
    "we also perform stacking analyses to see if there is any overlap between the catalogues and maps .",
    "the @xmath16 map of this region is of poor quality ; the data are shallow ( since the sensitivity at @xmath16 is worse ) and inhomogeneous ( being more prone to changes in the weather ) .",
    "we do not detect any of our @xmath47 m sources in the @xmath16 map , but we present 95 per cent confidence upper limits to the @xmath16 flux for each @xmath0 detection in table  [ tab : confirmedsources ] . the @xmath16 average ( or ` stacked ' ) flux density at the 3 @xmath0-detected positions is @xmath48 .    using an @xmath49 _ xmm - newton _ observation encompassing the northeast part of the gss , @xcite",
    "have uncovered about 150 sources down to flux limits of @xmath50 and @xmath51 in the soft ( 0.5@xmath52 ) and hard ( 2@xmath53 ) x - ray bands , respectively .",
    "of these detections , 7 lie within our submillimetre map and the x - ray positional errors are typically about 23 arcsec .",
    "no x - ray counterparts exist within the anticipated error circle of 4 \" , and indeed even there are no counterparts within a full beam of any scuba source .",
    "however , the stacked @xmath0 flux from the 7 x - ray positions lying within the submillimetre map region is @xmath54 .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath8 95 per cent confidence _",
    "lower _ limit to the mean flux of these sources .    these x - ray sources are therefore brighter than lyman - break galaxies at @xmath0 ( e.g.  @xcite ) !",
    "if agns do not comprise a large fraction of our sources , this result indicates that the x - ray emission originates from processes related to star - formation .",
    "this result illustrates that this map can , in fact , be used to make statistical remarks about @xmath55 sources even though individual detections are hopeless , and shows a path to populating the confusion sea in the submillimetre ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we have mapped approximately @xmath1 of the groth strip at @xmath0 with scuba on the jcmt to a @xmath2 depth of around @xmath24 .    using a robust source detection algorithm ,",
    "we have found 11 candidate sources with @xmath56 .",
    "monte carlo simulations suggest that most of these will either be spurious or considerably flux boosted .",
    "follow - up photometry observations have confirmed 2 of them and rejected 3 .",
    "based on these follow - up photometry data , we have determined , not surprisingly , that candidate sources in high - noise regions of the map have implausibly high apparent fluxes at snr @xmath57 , and are likely to be spurious false - positive detections .",
    "we reiterate that bright sources detected in a map should have @xmath7 before they have a reasonable chance of being real , and @xmath58 before they should be believed with any confidence .",
    "our final source list for the gss contains 2 confirmed scuba sources and 1 further candidate source with @xmath7 .",
    "using a combination of the unboosted map flux posterior probability distributions and the photometry measurements ( when available ) , we present best estimates of the flux for these objects .",
    "we have measured a mild statistical detection of low flux ( @xmath59 ) sources at x - ray wavelengths through a stacking analysis , and it may be that similar comparisons with data at other wavebands might also be fruitful .",
    "we have therefore made our maps available at http://cmbr.physics.ubc.ca/groth .",
    "our simple bayesian method for correcting the effects of flux boosting should be useful for future surveys such as shades and those carried out with scuba-2 , as well as for other instruments which provide data in the low snr near - confusion regime .",
    "it may also be useful to adapt this method in order to find sources , by searching for pixels in a map for which the posterior probability for @xmath60 is above some threshold .",
