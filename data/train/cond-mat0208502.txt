    "packings of hard particles interacting only with infinite repulsive pairwise forces on contact are applicable as models of complex manybody systems because repulsive interactions are the primary factor in determining their structure .",
    "hard - particle packings are therefore widely used as simple models for granular media @xcite , glasses @xcite , liquids @xcite , and other random media @xcite , to mention a few examples .",
    "furthermore , hard - particle packings , and especially hard - sphere packings , have inspired mathematicians and been the source of numerous challenging ( many still open ) theoretical problems @xcite .",
    "of particular theoretical and practical interest are _ jammed _ configurations of hard particles .",
    "the statistical physics of large jammed systems of hard particles is a very active field of theoretical research . for packings of smooth hard spheres",
    "a rigorous mathematical foundation can be given to the concept of jamming , though such rigor is often lacking in the current physical literature .",
    "there are still many important and challenging questions open even for the simplest type of hard - particle packings , i.e. , monodisperse packing of smooth perfectly impenetrable spheres",
    ". one category of open problems pertains to the enumeration and classification of disordered disk and sphere packings , such as the precise identification and quantitative description of the maximally random jammed ( mrj ) state @xcite , which has supplanted the ill - defined `` random close packed '' state .",
    "others pertain to the study of ordered systems and finding packing structures with extremal properties , such as the lowest or highest ( for polydisperse packings ) density jammed disk or sphere packings , for the various jamming categories described below @xcite .",
    "numerical algorithms have long been the primary tool for studying random packings quantitatively . in this work",
    "we take an important step toward future studies aimed at answering the challenging questions posed above by designing tools for algorithmic assesment of the jamming category of finite packings .    in the first part of this paper",
    ", we present the conceptual theoretical framework underlying this work .",
    "specifically , we review and expand on the hierarchical classification scheme for jammed packings into locally , collectively and strictly jammed packings proposed in ref . @xcite . in the second part ,",
    "we present a randomized linear programming algorithm for finding unjamming motions within the approximation of small displacements , focusing on periodic boundary conditions .",
    "finally , in the third part we apply the algorithm to monodisperse packings under periodic boundary conditions , and present some representative but non - exhaustive results for several periodic ordered lattice packings as well as random packings obtained via the lubachevsky - stillinger packing algorithm @xcite .",
    "ideas used here are drawn heavily from literature in the mathematical community ( @xcite , etc . ) , and these have only recently percolated into the granular materials community ( @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "a separate paper @xcite will attempt to give a unified and more rigorous presentation of the mathematical ideas underlying the concepts of stability , rigidity and jamming in sphere packings .",
    "nonetheless , some mathematical preliminaries are given here , a considerable portion of which is in the form of footnotes .",
    "the term jamming has been used often with ambiguity , even though the physical intuition behind it is strong : it imparts a feeling of being frozen in a given configuration .",
    "two main approaches can be taken to defining jamming , * kinematic * and * static*. in the kinematic approach , one considers the motion of particles away from their current positions , and this approach is for example relevant to the study of flow in granular media .",
    "the term _ jammed _ seems most appropriate here . in the static approach",
    ", one considers the mechanical properties of the packing and its ability to resist external forces .",
    "the term _ rigid _ is often used among physicists in relation to such considerations .",
    "however , due to the correspondence between kinematic and static properties , i.e. strains and stresses , these two different views are largely equivalent . a more thorough discussion of this duality is delayed to a later work @xcite , but is touched upon in section [ duality ] . in this paper",
    "we largely adopt a kinematic approach , but the reader should bear in mind the inherent ties to static approaches .",
    "first we repeat , with slight modifications as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the definitions of several hierarchical jamming categories as taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , and then make them mathematically specific and rigorous for several different types of sphere packings : + a finite system of spheres is :    locally  jammed : :    each particle in the system is locally trapped by its neighbors , i.e. ,    it can not be translated while fixing the positions of all other    particles .",
    "collectively  jammed : :    any locally jammed configuration in which no subset of particles can    simultaneously be displaced so that its members move out of contact    with one another and with the remainder set .",
    "an equivalent definition    is to ask that all finite subsets of particles be trapped by their    neighbors .",
    "strictly  jammed : :    any collectively jammed configuration that disallows all globally    uniform volume - nonincreasing deformations of the system boundary .",
    "note    the similarity with collective jamming but with the additional    provision of a deforming boundary .",
    "this difference and the physical    motivations behind it should become clearer in section    [ strict_jamming ] .",
    "observe that these are ordered _ hierarchically _ , with local being a prerequisite for collective and similarly collective being a prerequisite for strict jamming .",
    "the precise meaning of some of the concepts used in these definitions , such as unjamming , boundary and its deformation , depends on the type of packing one considers and on the particular problem at hand , and we next make these specializations more rigorous for specific types of packings of interest .",
    "moreover , we should point out that these do not exhaust all possibilities and various intricacies can arise , especially when considering infinite packings , to be discussed further in ref .",
    "it should be mentioned in passing that jammed random particle packings produced experimentally or in simulations typically contain a small population of `` rattlers '' , i.e. , particles trapped in a cage of jammed neighbours but free to move within the cage . for present purposes we shall assume that these have been removed before considering the ( possibly ) jammed remainder .      before discussing the algorithms and related issues , it is important to specify exactly what we mean by unjamming .",
    "first , it is helpful to define some terms . a * sphere packing * is a collection of spheres in euclidian @xmath0-dimensional space @xmath1 such that the interiors of no two spheres overlap . here",
    "we focus on monodisperse systems , where all spheres have diameter @xmath2 , but most of the results generalize to polydisperse systems as well .",

    "] , such that some of the contacting spheres lose contact with each other for @xmath13 .",
    "if such an unjamming motion does not exist , we say that the packing is _ _ jammed__. it can be shown ( see references in ref .",
    "@xcite ) that an equivalent definition is to say that a packing is jammed if it is isolated in the allowed configuration space , i.e. , there is no valid packing within some ( possibly small ) finite region around @xmath14 that are not equivalent to @xmath3 .",
    "we mention this because it is important to understand that although we use a kinematic description based on motion through time , which imparts a feeling of dynamics to most physicists , a perfectly equivalent static view is possible .",
    "therefore , henceforth special consideration will be given to the final displacement @xmath15 , so that we will most often just write @xmath16 .",
    "it is also useful to know that we need to only consider _ analytic _",
    "@xmath7 , which gives us the ability to focus only on derivatives of @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , it is a simple yet fundamental fact that we only need to consider first derivatives @xmath17 , which can be thought of as `` velocities '' , and then simply move the spheres in the directions @xmath18 to obtain an unjamming motion @xmath19 .",
    "that is , a sphere packing that is not jammed can be unjammed by giving the spheres velocities @xmath20 such that no two contacting spheres @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , have a relative speed @xmath24 toward each other:@xmath25 where @xmath26is the unit vector connecting the two spheres .",
    "of course , some special and trivial cases like rigid body translations ( @xmath27 ) need to be excluded since they do not really change the configuration of the system .    in this paper we will plot unjamming motions as `` velocity '' fields , and occasionally supplement such illustrations with a sequence of frames from @xmath28 to @xmath29 showing the unjamming process .",
    "note that the lengths of the vectors in the velocity fields have been scaled to aid in better visualization along @xmath10 to check when the first collision occurs .",

    "given a sphere packing , we would often like to test whether it is jammed according to each of the categories given above , and if it is not , find one or several unjamming motions @xmath7 .",
    "we now describe a simple algorithm to do this that is exact for _ gap - less packings _ , i.e. , packings where neighboring spheres touch exactly , and for which the definitions given earlier apply directly . however , in practice",

    "we do this in such a way as to also maintain the applicability of our efficient randomized linear programming algorithm using what roux @xcite calls the _ approximation of small displacements _ ( asd ) .",
    "as already explained , an unjamming motion for a sphere packing can be obtained by giving the spheres suitable velocities , such that neighboring spheres do not approach each other . here",
    "we focus on the case when @xmath51 are small finite displacements from the current configuration .",
    "therefore , we will drop the time designation and just use @xmath52 for the displacements from the current configuration @xmath14 to the new configuration @xmath53 .    in this asd approximation , we can linearize the impenetrability constraints by expanding to first order in @xmath52 , @xmath54 to get the condition for the existence of a _ feasible displacement _ @xmath52,@xmath55 where @xmath56 represents a _ potential contact _ between nearby spheres @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath57 is the _ _ interparticle gap _ _ , and @xmath26 is the unit vector along the direction of the contact @xmath56 . for a gap - less packing , we have @xmath58 and the condition ( [ impenetrability_l ] ) reduces to ( [ relative_velocity ] ) , which as we explained along with the conditions @xmath59 and @xmath60 is an _ exact",

    "but choosing a very small tolerance makes it impossible to treat systems with moderately large interparticle gaps ( say of the order of @xmath64 ) . ] .",
    "the complicated issue of how well the asd approximation works when the gaps are not small enough is illustrated in fig .",

    "@xcite for details , and also @xcite for a treatment of more general packings ) . figure [ contact_100 ] shows a small random packing with relatively large gaps and the associated contact network .",
    "handling different boundary conditions within the above formulation is easy .",
    "for example , for usual periodic conditions , handling the boundaries merely amounts to adding a few columns to the rigidity matrix @xmath68 with @xmath73 for all images @xmath74 which have contacts with one of the original spheres @xmath21 .",
    "these columns correspond to the periodic contacts wrapping the packing around the torus .    for hard - wall boundaries , we would add a potential particle contact to the contact network from each sphere close to a wall to the closest point on the wall , and fix this endpoint .",
    "such fixed points of contact and fixed spheres @xmath22 are simply handled by transferring the corresponding term @xmath75 to the right - hand side of the constraints in ( [ impenetrability ] ) .",
    "we are now ready to explain how one can find unjamming motions for a given packing , if such exist . but first , we need to refine our definition of an unjamming motion to allow for the study of packings with finite gaps .",
    "the problem with packings with small gaps is that according to our previous definition of an unjamming motion in section [ unjamming_motions ] , such packings will never be jammed , since it will always be possible to move some of the spheres at distances comparable to the sizes of the interparticle gaps so that they lose contact with all or most of their neighbors .",
    "clearly we wish to only consider the possibility of displacing some of the spheres such that _ considerable _ gaps appear , larger then some threshold value @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a measure of the magnitude of the interparticle gaps . therefore , we have the modified definition : an * unjamming * * motion * @xmath7 , @xmath9   $ ] , is a _ continuous _ displacement of the spheres from their current position along the path @xmath10 , starting from the current configuration , @xmath11 , and observing all relevant constraints along the way , such that some of the spheres lose contact .",
    "] with each other in the final configuration @xmath12 by more then a given @xmath78 .",
    "again , we exclude any trivial rigid - body type motions such as a uniform translation of the spheres from consideration .    the problem of whether such an unjamming motion exists and how to find one if it does is mathematically very interesting if we take the case @xmath79 .",
    "but this problem is extremely complex due to high non - linearity of the impenetrability constraints and we will make no attempt to solve it . it also is not clear that this would be of interest to physicists .",
    "instead , we focus our attention on the case when @xmath78 is small enough to apply with a reasonable degree of accuracy the approximation of small displacements , but large enough compared to the interparticle gaps so that the exact value is really irrelevant .    under the asd ,",
    "we need only worry about linear displacements from the current configuration , @xmath19 , and so we can focus on @xmath80 .",
    "thus , finding an unjamming motion , we should change terminology and call @xmath81 an * unjamming displacement*. however , to emphasize the fact that there is a way to continuously move the spheres to achieve this displacement , and also that we can always scale _ down _ the magnitude of an allowed @xmath52 arbitrarily , we continue to say unjamming motion . the term `` displacement",
    "'' will be more appropriate in section [ duality ] . ]",

    ", whether the system ( [ feasibility_question ] ) is feasible , can be answered rigorously , @xmath84 , can be studied rigorously .",

    "also , we note that one can not hope to fully characterize the cone of first - order unjamming motions @xmath100",

    "we stress that despite its randomized character , this algorithm is almost rigorous when used as a test of jamming , in the sense that it is _ strictly rigorous _ for gap - less packings and also for packings with small gaps as explained in more detail in footnote [ polyhedrons_cones ] .",
    "recall that the condition for a packing to be locally jammed is that _ each particle be fixed by its neighbors_. this is easy to check .",

    "computationally , we have found testing for local jamming using ( [ lp_local ] ) to be quite efficient and simple .",
    "the randomized lp algorithm was designed to test for collective jamming in large packings , and in this case the linear program ( [ lp_displacement ] ) that needs to be solved is very large and sparse .",

    "we have implemented an efficient numerical solution of ( [ lp_displacement ] ) [ and also ( [ lp_force ] ) ] , using the primal - dual interior - point algorithm in the optimization library ( see ref .",
    "illustrations of results obtained using this implementation are given throughout this paper .",
    "we would like to stress that primal - dual interior - point algorithms are very well suited for problems of this type , and should also be intuitive to physicists since in essence they solve a sequence of easier problems in which the perfectly rigid inter - sphere contacts are replaced by stiff ( but still deformable ) nonlinear ( logarithmic ) springs , carefully numerically taking the limit of infinitely stiff springs .",

    "not only are the algorithms implemented theoretically well - analyzed , but they are tested on a variety of cases and often contain several alternative implementations of computation - intensive sections targeting different types of problems .",
    "choice of the correct algorithm and the details are often complex , but well worth the effort .    nonetheless , for three - dimensional problems the available implementations of interior - point algorithms based on direct linear solvers are too memory demanding and inefficient .",
    "tuned implementations based on conjugate - gradient iterative solvers are needed .",
    "we plan to develop efficient parallel algorithms suited for these types of problems and make them publicly available in the very near future .",
    "to extend the notion of collective jamming to strict jamming we introduced deformations of the boundary . in the case of periodic packings ,",
    "_ the lattice @xmath37 is the boundary_. therefore , the only difference with collective jamming is that we will now allow the lattice to change while the spheres move , i.e. , @xmath111 in ( [ periodic_bcs ] ) .",

    "the actual implementation now requires more care and bookkeeping , but the conceptual changes should be clear , and the randomized lp algorithm remains applicable .",
    "obviously , we can not allow the volume of the unit cell to enlarge , since the unit cell is in a sense the container holding the packing together .",

    "that is , we can still only focus on linear motions @xmath114 , @xmath115 and the final small deformations @xmath116 , and need to consider only first - order linearizations of the impenetrability ( [ impenetrability_nl ] ) and non - expansion ( [ volume_preservation_nl ] ) nonlinear constraints ) needs to hold also . ] .    the linearized version of ( [ volume_preservation_nl ] ) is:@xmath117\\leq 0\\ ] ] and this is just one extra linear constraint to be added to the linear program ( [ lp_displacement ] ) .",
    "an extra condition which needs to be added is that _ _ _ _ @xmath118 be symmetric , which is also an added linear constraint,@xmath119 where we add @xmath120 as an unknown in the randomized lp algorithm .",
    "this condition in fact does nothing more then eliminate trivial rotations of the lattice .",
    "the motivation for the category of strict jamming and its above interpretation in the periodic case should be clear : changing the lattice in a volume non - increasing way models _",
    "macroscopic non - tensile strain _ and is therefore of great relevance to studying the macroscopic mechanical properties of random packings ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in fact",
    ", @xmath121 can be interpreted as the `` macroscopic '' _ strain - tensor _ , which explains why it is symmetric and also trace - free for shear deformations .",
    "we also again point out that strict jamming is ( significantly ) stronger then collective jamming for periodic boundary conditions , particularly in two - dimensional packings .",
    "this point is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ connelly.3.strict.unjamming ] , which shows an unjamming motion involving a deformation of the lattice , even though this lattice packing is collectively jammed .",
    "the following heuristic test for collective jamming has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite : shrink the particles by a small amount @xmath62 and then start the lubachevsky - stillinger molecular dynamics algorithm with random velocities , and see if the system gets unjammed .",
    "one would also slowly enlarge the particles back to their original size while they bump around , so as to allow finite termination of this test ( within numerical accuracies ) .",

    "however , notice that this cone can in principle be very small , so finding a ray in it may be a low - probability occurrence . for packings with finite gaps , though , the heuristic incorporates nonlinear effects , which is an advantage . ] .",
    "animations of this process can be found at ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this kind of heuristic has the advantage of being very simple and thus easy to implement and use , and it is also very efficient .",
    "the real problem is not so much its indeterminacy , but its strong dependence on the exact value of @xmath62 .",
    "for example , animations showing how the kagom lattice inside a container made of fixed spheres ( as in fig .",
    "[ honeycomb.pinned.unjamming ] ) can be unjammed with a large - enough @xmath62 , even though it is actually collectively jammed under these boundary conditions , can be found at ref .",
    "in fact , many jammed _ large _ packings will appear unstable under this kind of test , as motivated with the notion of _ uniform stability _",
    ", defined in ref .",
    "@xcite and elaborated on in ref .",
    "in this work we emphasize the utility of the randomized linear programming algorithm as a testing tool for jamming , and also for finding representative unjamming motions .",
    "the unjamming motions one finds can be used inside compression algorithms .",
    "for example , the lubachevsky - stillinger algorithm may sometimes get stuck in a particular configuration even though the configuration is not collectively or strictly jammed ( particularly in two dimensions , as explained later ) . the unjamming motion obtained from the linear programming algorithm",
    "can then be used to continue the compression and restart the compression with random velocities or use initial velocities along @xmath52 to unjam the packing and continue the simulation . ] .",
    "even more can be done with linear programming in this direction .",
    "for example , one can ask the question of whether there is an unjamming motion @xmath52 in which all sphere contacts are lost , where @xmath122 . ] . this can be done for example by solving the lp,@xmath123 by displacing the spheres by such a @xmath52 we would create a `` cushion '' of free space around each sphere , so that we can actually increase the radius of the spheres . ] and thus increase the density , or equivalently , the packing fraction @xmath124 .",
    "we believe these kinds of approaches to be too inefficient , since solving a large - scale linear program is too expensive to be used iteratively .",
    "this is reminiscent of the high - quality but rather expensive compression algorithm of zinchenko ( see ref .",

    "these two lp s are of great importance in studying the _ stress - strain _ behavior of granular materials , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , and since they are equivalent to each other , we can call them the _ asd stress - strain lp_.    we wish to emphasize that by using primal - dual interior point algorithms we automatically get both forces and displacements using the same implementation .",
    "we have emphasized the displacement formulation ( [ lp_displacement ] ) simply because we based our discussion of jamming on a kinematic perspective , but a parallel static interpretation can easily be given .",
    "for example , a random @xmath90 used in the randomized lp algorithm that finds an unbounded unjamming motion physically corresponds to a load that the packing can not support , i.e. the force formulation lp is ( dual ) infeasible , implying that the displacement formulation lp is ( primal ) unbounded .",
    "the meaning of collective jamming within the asd in the presence of small gaps from a static standpoint now becomes clear : a collectively jammed packing can resist ( support ) any force loading by ( as ) small ( as possible ) rearrangements of the spheres , in which some of the potential contacts are open and others closed , depending on the loading and the interparticle gaps .",
    "in general the stress - strain lp will be highly degenerate and its primal and/or dual solution not unique .",
    "however , as roux points out , the existence of small gaps in random packings is very important in this context .",
    "namely , if @xmath127 is random and nonzero ( however small ) , and @xmath90 is also random , theorems on the generic character of linear programs ( see the references in ref .",
    "@xcite ) can be invoked to guarantee that both the primal and dual solutions will be non - degenerate .",
    "a non - degenerate solution to ( [ lp_force ] ) corresponds to an isostatic force - carrying contact network , a fact noted and explained in a great many ways by various researchers in the field of granular materials @xcite . we just mention these points here in order to stimulate interest among the physical community in the very relevant results to be found in the mathematical programming literature .",
    "we have applied the randomized lp algorithm to test for the different jamming categories in practice .",
    "the primary aim of this work is not to give exhaustive results , but rather to introduce a conceptual framework and some algorithms .",
    "nonetheless , in this section we present some sample relevant results for both ordered and disordered periodic packings .",
    "table 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite gives a classification of some common simple lattice packings into jamming categories for hard - wall boundary conditions .",
    "lattices_table ] reproduces this for periodic boundary conditions . as we explained in section [ boundary_conditions ] , the results in principle will depend on the number of unit cells @xmath128 chosen as the original packing , and also on the unit cell chosen , so the terminology `` lattice x is y jammed '' is used loosely here .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it turns out that in the cases given in table [ lattices_table ] , the packings we have classified as not collectively or strictly jammed will not be so for any large @xmath44 . here",
    "we give the smallest @xmath44 for which we have found unjamming motions , and illustrate some of these in figs .",
    "[ kagome_honeycomb.collective.unjamming ] and [ honeycomb.strict.unjamming ] .",
    "moreover , the packings classified as jammed , in this case being the maximal density packings in two dimensions ( triangular ) and three dimensions ( fcp and hcp ) will be so for any finite @xmath44 .",
    "we leave justification and further discussion of this to ref . @xcite . here",
    "we just point out for the curious that the triangular lattice is not the only strictly jammed ordered disk packing ; two other examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ kagome_reinforced ] ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we also tested a sample of periodic random packings in two and three dimensions produced via the lubachevsky - stillinger compression algorithm @xcite at different compression rates .",
    "this algorithm often tends to produce a certain number of rattlers , i.e. , spheres which are not locally jammed , which we _ _ remove _ _ before testing for jamming ) only once is not enough under this removal scheme .",
    "specifically , once a rattling sphere is removed , this may remove some contacts from the packing and can make other spheres not locally jammed .",
    "therefore , neighbors of rattlers are recycled on a stack of spheres to be checked for local jamming .",
    "we have observed that often , particularly in two - dimensional ls packings , _ all disks can eventually be removed _ on the basis of just the local jamming test starting with only a few percent rattlers . ] .",
    "we would like to stress that these are not comprehensive tests , but they do illustrate some essential points , and so instead of giving tables with statistics , we give some representative illustrations .",
    "the tolerances for the interparticle gaps ( see footnote [ gap_tolerance ] ) used were in the range @xmath129   $ ] , and , as explained earlier , the results in some cases depend on this chosen tolerance , but not strongly .    _",
    "all random disk ( i.e. , two - dimensional ) packings we tested were _ * _ not _ * _ strictly jammed_. at the typical ls end states of roughly @xmath130 , we generally found that the packings were collectively jammed ( with some exceptions such as the packing shown in fig . [ ls.dilute.collective.unjamming ] ) , although not strictly jammed , as with the packing depicted in fig .",
    "[ ls.dilute.strict.unjamming ] .",
    "however , even at very high densities ( @xmath131 ) the packings were only collectively jammed , as illustrated in fig . [ ls.dense.strict.unjamming ] .",
    "note that quite different properties were observed for the three - dimensional packings : _ all random sphere ( i.e. , three - dimensional ) packings we tested were strictly ( and thus collectively ) jammed_.",
    "our results have important implications for the classification of random disk and sphere packings and suggest a number of interesting avenues of inquiry for future investigations .",
    "random disk packings are less well - understood then sphere packings . the tendency of disk packings to `` crystalize '' ( to form ordered , locally dense domains ) at sufficiently high densities is well established .",
    "for example , quickenden and tan @xcite experimentally estimated the packing fraction of the `` random close packed '' ( rcp ) state to be @xmath132 and found that the packing fraction could be further increased until the maximum value of @xmath133 was achieved for the triangular lattice packing . by contrast , typical random sphere packings at @xmath124 in the range @xmath134 can not be further densified .",
    "our recent understanding of the ill - defined nature of random close packing and of jamming categories raises serious questions about previous two - dimensional studies , particularly the stability of such packings .",
    "our present study suggests that random disk packings are not strictly jammed at @xmath132 ; at best they may be collectively jammed .",
    "of course , the old concept of the rcp state was invalid in that it did not account for the jamming category of the packing .",
    "previous attempts to estimate the packing fraction of the `` random loose '' state @xcite are even more problematic , given that this term is even less well - defined then the rcp state .",
    "the best way to categorize random disk packings is to determine the maximally random jammed ( mrj ) state ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) for each of the three jamming categories ( local , collective and strict ) .",
    "such investigations have been initiated @xcite and will be carried out in the future .",
    "the identification of the mrj state for strictly jammed _ disk _ packings is an intriguing open problem . on the one hand",
    ", we have shown that random packings exist with densities in the vicinity of the maximum possible value ( @xmath135 ) that are not strictly jammed , and on the other hand , there is a conjectured achievable lower bound @xmath136 corresponding to the `` reinforced '' kagom lattice ( see fig . [ kagome_reinforced ] ) . for random sphere packings , an initial study undertaken in ref .",
    "@xcite , using the lp algorithm described in this work , found that maximally disordered random packings around @xmath137 were strictly jammed .",
    "this suggests a close relation between the conventionally accepted rcp packing fraction and the packing fraction of the mrj state for strictly jammed packings .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that at a fixed packing fraction @xmath137 the variation in the order can be substantial and hence packing fraction alone can not completely characterize a random packing .",
    "the conventionally accepted rcp packing fraction in two dimensions may be approximately close in value to the packing fraction of the mrj state for _ collectively _ jammed packings .",
    "much less obvious is what is the mrj state for collectively jammed sphere packings . finally , a completely unexplored question concerns the identification of the mrj state for locally jammed disk and sphere packings",
    "in this work we have proposed , implemented , and tested a practical algorithm for verifying jamming categories in finite sphere packings based on linear programming , demonstrated its simplicity and utility , and presented some representative results for ordered lattices and random packings .",
    "interestingly , the random packings that we tested were strictly jammed in three dimensions , but _ not _ in two dimensions .",
    "future applications of the randomized linear - programming algorithm are to be expected",
    ". we will further present and explore the theoretical connections between rigidity and jamming , kinematic and static rigidity , rigidity and energy , rigidity and stability , and finite , periodic and infinite packings in ref .",
