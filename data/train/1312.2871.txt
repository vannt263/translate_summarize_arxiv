    "for centuries astrometry was the primary focus of astronomy . before the 17@xmath2 century",
    ", astronomers charted the locations of naked - eye stars with an accuracy of a fraction of an arcminute . with this level of accuracy , all but a handful of the highest proper motion stars remain `` fixed '' for an astronomer s lifetime , and it was not until galileo s introduction of the telescope in astronomy that arcsecond precision became a possibility .    for millennia two great questions remained unanswered : was the earth at the center of the universe and how large was the universe ?",
    "both questions could be answered through astrometry by measuring the parallax of stars .",
    "if the earth revolved around the sun , stars would exhibit yearly shifts in apparent position ( annual parallax ) and , if measured , these would indicate their distances ( at that time equivalent to the `` size of the universe '' ) . this scientific opportunity led most scientists of the period to attempt astrometric measurements to detect parallax ( @xcite ) .",
    "early attempts to measure parallax by robert hooke , and later james bradley , compared the tilt of a near - vertical telescope to that of a plumb - line as the star @xmath3  draconis transited directly overhead in london .",
    "bradley , after discovering and accounting for aberration of light ( a yearly @xmath420  arcsec effect caused by the earth s orbital motion ) , was only able to place an upper limit of 0.5 arcsec on the annual parallax of the star .",
    "it was not until 1838 that friedrich wilhelm bessel presented the first convincing measurement of stellar parallax : 0.314 arcsec for the star 61  cygni ( chosen as a candidate by its large proper motion of @xmath5 arcsec yr@xmath6 ) .",
    "bessel and others followed a suggestion attributed to galileo to measure _ relative _ parallax , the differential position shift of a nearby target star relative to a distant background star , rather than _ absolute _ position shifts .",
    "this approach still forms the basis of the highest accuracy measurements made today .",
    "currently astrometric accuracy using very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) at centimeter wavelengths is approaching the @xmath1  level . this review documents the state of the art in radio astrometry , focusing both on the techniques and the scientific results .",
    "karl jansky made the first astronomical observations at radio wavelengths in the 1920s . while searching for the source of interference in trans - atlantic telephone calls ( mostly from lightning in the tropics ) , he noted strong emission localized within a few degrees in the constellation of sagittarius .",
    "the peak of the signal drifted in time at a sidereal rate , indicating an origin outside the solar system , and was ultimately traced to energetic ( synchrotron emitting ) electrons throughout the milky way , but concentrated toward the center .",
    "the development of radar during wwii , gave a boost to radio astronomy in the 1940s and 1950s .",
    "astrometric precision with a single radio telescope was generally limited to some fraction of the diffraction limit , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the observing wavelength and @xmath9 is the antenna diameter . even though radio antennas were an order of magnitude larger than optical telescopes , the roughly four orders of magnitude longer wavelength seemed to doom radio astrometry .",
    "however , that changed with the development of radio interferometry . in the 1960s , interferometers with baselines of @xmath1 km localized the positions of quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) , leading to the discovery of highly redshifted optical emission . over the years , with increasing baseline length , positional accuracy with ( connected - element ) interferometers improved from @xmath1 to @xmath10 arcseconds ( @xcite ) .    in the late 1960s ,",
    "radio interferometry was greatly extended by removing the need for a direct connection ( either with cables or microwave links ) between antennas .",
    "signals were accurately time tagged using independent atomic clocks and recorded on magnetic tape , allowing separations of interferometer elements across the earth .",
    "this technique , called very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) , lead to many discoveries , including super - luminal motion in jets from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and upper limits of @xmath1 pc on the size of the emitting regions .",
    "both results provided strong evidence for super - massive black holes as the engines for agn ( @xcite ) .",
    "early vlbi observations with intrinsic angular resolution better than 1 mas offered absolute position accuracy of @xmath11 mas using group - delay observables ( @xcite ) and relative astrometric accuracy between fortuitously close pairings of qsos of @xmath0  using phase - delay information ( @xcite ) .    starting in the 2000s , calibration techniques",
    "improved to the point where relative positional accuracy of @xmath0  could be routinely achieved for most bright targets , relative to a detectable qso usually within a couple of degrees on the sky .",
    "this changed the game dramatically .",
    "such astrometric accuracy is unsurpassed in astronomy and is comparable to , or better than , the target accuracy of the next european astrometric space mission : gaia ( @xcite ) . since radio waves are not absorbed significantly by interstellar dust , the entire milky way is available for observation .",
    "also , since qsos are used as the position reference , _ absolute _ parallax and proper motions are directly measurable .",
    "such measurements for over 100 star forming regions have now been made for sources as distant as 11 kpc .",
    "significant results ( see  [ sect : applications ] ) include a resolution of the hipparcos pleiades distance controversy ( @xcite ) , 3-dimensional `` imaging '' of nearby star forming regions ( @xcite ) , and the most accurate measurements to date of the distance to the galactic center , , and the circular rotation speed of the local standard of rest ,  ( @xcite ) .",
    "since distance is fundamental to astrophysical understanding , it should not be surprising that radio astrometry and parallax measurements are critical for characterizing a wide variety of phenomena and classes of sources . here",
    "we briefly discuss some of the more important astrophysical applications of radio astrometry .",
    "surprisingly , we know little of the spiral structure of the milky way ; there is considerable debate over the number of spiral arms , the nature of the central bar , and the values of the fundamental parameters  ( distance to galactic center ) and  ( circular rotation speed of the lsr ) .",
    "major projects are underway to map the milky way with the vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( vera ) array and the very long baseline array ( vlba ) array , though the bar and spiral structure legacy ( bessel ) survey . with typical parallax accuracy of @xmath12  , and best accuracy of @xmath13  , one can measure distances of 5 and 20 kpc , respectively , with @xmath410% accuracy .",
    "for example , parallax data for the most distant source measured to date , the massive star forming region w  49 , are shown in * figure  [ fig : w49]*. over 100 distances to high - mass star forming regions have been measured using the astronomical `` gold standard '' technique of trigonometric parallax ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "attempts to decode the nature of the spiral structure of the milky way have long relied on kinematic distance estimates ( by comparing the doppler velocity of a source and that expected from a model of galactic rotation with distance as a free parameter ) .",
    "one of the first high - precision vlba parallaxes was for the massive star forming region w3(oh ) ; @xcite found a distance of @xmath14 kpc , confirmed by @xcite .",
    "this distance was more than a factor of two less than its kinematic distance , demonstrating how unreliable kinematic distances can be .",
    "now , with `` gold standard '' trigonometric parallaxes , the major spiral features of the milky way are , for the first time , being accurately located and spiral arm pitch angles measured ( see * figure  [ fig : parallaxes ] * ) .",
    "recent surprises include that the local ( orion ) arm , thought to be a minor structure , is longer and has far more on - going star formation than previously thought and rivals the perseus spiral arm in the second and third galactic quadrants ( @xcite ) .    with measured source",
    "coordinates , distance , proper motion , and radial velocity , one has full phase - space ( 3-dimensional position and velocity ) information .",
    "these data can be modeled to yield an estimate of , , and the slope of the galaxy s rotation curve .",
    "the latest modeling indicates that @xmath15  kpc and @xmath16  ( @xcite ) . also , the rotation curve between 4 and 13 kpc from the galactic center is very flat ( @xcite ) .",
    "such a large value for  ( about 15% larger than the iau recommended value of 220  ) , if confirmed by other measurements , would have widespread impact in astrophysics , including increasing the total mass ( including dark matter halo ) of the milky way by about 50% , revising local group dynamics by changing the milky way s mass and velocities of group members ( when transforming from heliocentric to galactocentric coordinate systems ) , and increasing the expected signal from dark matter annihilation radiation .",
    "gould s belt , a flattened structure of star forming regions of radius @xmath17 kpc and centered @xmath18 kpc from the sun ( toward the galactic anticenter ) , contains most of the sites of current star formation near the sun (  the ophiucus , lupus , taurus , orion , aquila rift and serpens star forming regions ) .",
    "most of our knowledge about the formation of stars like the sun comes from in - depth studies of these regions , for example , from the spitzer c2d survey ( @xcite ) , the xmm newton extended survey of taurus ( @xcite ) and the herschel gould belt survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "of course , knowledge of distance is critical for quantitative measures of cloud and young stellar object ( yso ) sizes , masses , luminosities and ages . for such deeply embedded sources , which are optically invisible ,",
    "typically distances had not been estimated to an accuracy of better than @xmath19% . since some physical parameters depend on distance squared or cubed",
    ", these parameters can be in error by factors of @xmath20 .",
    "trigonometic parallax measurements with vlbi techniques can be made by observing gyro - synchrotron emission from t tauri objects , which is usually confined to a region of a few stellar radii , or from  maser emission often associated with herbig - haro outflows .",
    "currently , about a dozen ysos parallaxes have been obtained , with up to 200 planned in this decade .    in the ophiucus cloud , @xcite , using the vlba , found that sources s1 and doar21 are at a mean distance of @xmath21 pc ; @xcite using vera found a consistent distance of @xmath22 pc , albeit with larger uncertainty , for the  masers toward iras 16293@xmath232422 .",
    "the taurus molecular cloud has been well studied and parallaxes for five ysos have been reported from vlba observations in a series of papers ( @xcite ) .",
    "these locate three ysos associated with the l  1495 dark cloud at a distance of @xmath24 pc and , interestingly , t tauri sb at @xmath25 pc and hp tau / g3 at @xmath26 pc .",
    "clearly , these observations are tracing the 3-dimensional structure of the cloud , which is extended over about 30 pc along the line of sight , consistent with its extent on the sky of @xmath27 ( @xmath28 pc ) .",
    "vera observations have yielded parallaxes to ysos in the perseus molecular cloud . observing  masers ,",
    "@xcite measured parallax distances of @xmath29 pc for the svs  13 toward ngc  1333 and @xmath30 pc for l  1448  c ( @xcite ) .",
    "these measurements clarified the distance to the perseus cloud , which was highly uncertain  estimated at between 220 pc ( @xcite ) and 350 pc ( @xcite ) .",
    "the serpens cloud provides another example where previous optical - based distance estimates varied considerably from 250 to 700 pc , with recent convergence toward the low end at @xmath31 pc , as summarized by @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite used the vlba to obtain a trigonometric parallax distance for ec  59 of @xmath32 pc and suggested that faulty identification of dusty clouds in the foreground aquila rift might account for optical distance estimate .",
    "the orion nebula is perhaps the most widely studied region of star formation . prior to 1981 , distance estimates for the orion nebula ranged from about 380 to 520 pc as summarized by @xcite . by comparing radial and proper motions ( measured with vlbi observations ) of  masers toward the kleinman  low ( kl ) nebula , an active region of star formation within the orion nebula ,",
    "genzel  estimated the distance to be @xmath33 pc . since then , four independent trigonometric parallax measurements have been performed .",
    "@xcite observed gyro - synchrotron emission from a yso over nearly 2 yr and obtained a parallax distance of @xmath34 pc using the vlba .",
    "@xcite using vera measured  masers and determined a distance of @xmath35 pc for the kl region .",
    "recently , two very accurate parallaxes have been published : @xcite used the vlba and observed continuum emission from three ysos and determined a distance of @xmath36 pc ; @xcite using vera and observing  masers estimated a distance of @xmath37 pc .",
    "the latter two measurements from different groups , using different vlbi arrays , different target sources , and different correlators and software are in excellent agreement .",
    "together they indicate that the kl nebula / trapezium region of the orion nebula is at a distance of @xmath38pc , nearly a 1% accurate distance ! since , the orion nebula is the subject of large surveys , from x - rays to radio waves , having such a `` gold - standard '' distance will enable precise estimates of sizes , luminosities , masses , and ages .",
    "a large number ( @xmath39 ) of parallaxes have been measured with the vlba and evn arrays for maser sources in high mass star forming regions ( @xcite ) and by the vera array ( @xcite ) .",
    "as the focus of these observations has been to better understand galactic structure , we discuss these in  [ sect : galactic ] .",
    "asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars are in late stages of stellar evolution and have large convective envelopes and high mass - loss rates .",
    "they often exhibit maser emission from circumstellar oh , h@xmath40o and sio molecules , providing good targets for radio astrometry with vlbi .",
    "accurate distances to agb stars are necessary to constrain their physical parameters , such as size and luminosity , and these are crucial to test theories of late stages of stellar evolution . and , of course , distances are needed to calibrate the period - luminosity ( p - l ) relation of mira variables , which can be used as standard candles ,  @xcite .",
    "giant stars are not good astrometric targets at optical wavelengths and the best optical parallaxes have accuracies poorer than a few mas .",
    "however , parallaxes based on radio observations of circumstellar masers has demonstrated more than a factor of ten better parallax accuracy , allowing much better calibration of the mira p - l relation .",
    "early astrometric observations with the vlba for red - giant oh masers demonstrated the potential for parallax measurements , achieving between 0.3 and 2 mas uncertainties ( @xcite ) .",
    "for example , parallax distances for s crb ( @xmath41 pc ) and u her ( @xmath42 pc ) by @xcite are considerably more accurate than those measured by the hipparcos satellite .",
    "astrometry of oh masers at the relatively low observing frequency of 1.6 ghz are limited by uncompensated ionospheric effects , but these effects can be minimized by observations near solar minimum and using in - beam calibrators very close to the targets .",
    "the first vlbi parallax of an agb star using h@xmath40o masers at 22 ghz revealed a distance for ux cyg , a long period mira variable , of @xmath43 kpc ( @xcite ) . since then the vera array has been used to obtain parallaxes for many mira and semi - regular variables , including s crt ( @xcite )",
    ", sy scl @xcite , and rx boo ( @xcite ) .",
    "of particular interest are the astrometric measurements for the symbiotic system r aqr ( @xcite ) and the parallax distance of @xmath44 pc ( @xcite ) .",
    "future observations may enable one to trace binary s orbital motion .",
    "red supergiants are rare objects , typically at kpc distances . at these distances , and owing to their very large sizes and irregular photospheres , they are beyond the reach of optical parallax measurements . @xcite observed  masers toward vy cma , one of the best - studied red supergiants , and found a parallax distance of @xmath45 kpc with vera .",
    "this distance was later confirmed by @xcite , who used the vlba and found a distance of @xmath46 kpc .",
    "generally , the distance had been assumed to be 1.5 kpc , requiring an extraordinary luminosity of @xmath47 ; the parallax distances reduce the luminosity estimate by 40% to a more reasonable value .",
    "vlbi parallaxes accurate to @xmath48% have been obtained for several other red supergiants , including s per ( @xcite ) , nml cyg ( @xcite ) , and iras 22480 + 6002 ( @xcite ) .",
    "proto - planetary nebulae are in the final stage of evolution of intermediate - mass stars , linking the agb and planetary nebula phases .",
    "these sources are known to exhibit bipolar outflows with a velocities exceeding @xmath49100 km s@xmath6 ; they can have strong  masers and are often called `` water - fountains . ''",
    "parallaxes have been measured for iras 19134 + 2131 ( @xcite , iras 19312 + 1950 ( @xcite ) , iras 18286 - 0959 ( @xcite ) , and k  3 - 35 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the first trigonometric parallax for a black hole candidate was for the x - ray binary v404 cyg ( @xcite ) , indicating a distance of @xmath50 kpc .",
    "this value was significantly lower than previously estimated and indicated that its 1989 outburst was not super - eddington .",
    "its peculiar velocity , derived from the radio proper motion , is only about 40 , suggesting that it did not receive a large natal `` kick '' from an asymmetric supernova explosion .",
    "this differs from many pulsars , which often have order of magnitude larger peculiar motions ( see  [ sect : pulsars ] ) .    the long - standing uncertainty over the distance to cyg x-1 ( see , , @xcite ) limited understanding of this famous binary , including whether or not the unseen companion was a black hole .",
    "recently a trigonometric parallax measurement with the vlba yielded a distance of @xmath51 kpc ( @xcite ) . knowing the distance to the binary removed the mass  distance degeneracy that limited the modeling of optical / ir data ( light and velocity curves ) and revealed that the unseen companion in cyg x-1 has a mass of @xmath52   ( @xcite ) .",
    "this mass confidently exceeds the limit for a neutron star and firmly established it as a black hole .",
    "once the masses of the two stars were accurately determined , x - ray data could be well modeled .",
    "this revealed that black hole spin is near maximal and , since the binary is too young for accretion to have appreciably spun up the black hole , most of the spin angular momentum is probably natal ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the 3-dimensional space - motion of the binary , from the radio astrometry and optical doppler shifts , confirms cyg x-1 as a member of the cyg ob3 association , and the lack of evidence for a supernova explosion in this region suggests that the black hole may have formed via prompt collapse without an explosion ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , using the evn and the vlba , @xcite obtained a parallax distance of @xmath53 pc for ss cyg , a binary composed of a white and red dwarf .",
    "this distance is significantly less than an optical parallax measured with the hubble space telescope of @xmath54 pc ( @xcite ) .",
    "the larger optical distance required the source to be significantly more luminous and proved difficult to reconcile with accretion disk theory .",
    "however , the smaller distance from radio astrometry seems to resolve this problem .",
    "pulsar radio emissions are extremely compact and relatively bright , which make them suitable for vlbi observations , and radio astrometry of pulsars dates back to the 1980 s .",
    "the first interferometric parallax measurements were by @xcite , who reported parallaxes for two pulsars using a vlbi array which included the arecibo 305-m telescope .",
    "later @xcite measured a parallax for psr 1451@xmath2368 of @xmath55 mas , using the parkes ",
    "tidbinbilla interferometer in australia , and determined a line - of - sight average interstellar electron density of @xmath56 @xmath57 by combining the distance and dispersion measures , suggesting that the interstellar medium in the solar neighborhood is typical of that over larger scales in the galaxy .",
    "pulsar proper motions for 6 pulsars conducted with the parkes ",
    "tidbinbilla interferometer revealed that motions away from the galactic plane were between 70 and 600  ( @xcite ) .",
    "these early studies provided distances and confirmed the expectation that pulsars are high - velocity objects , most - likely due to `` kicks '' associated with their parent supernova explosions .",
    "most recent pulsar astrometry uses `` in - beam '' calibrators to greatly improve positional accuracy .",
    "other improvements include gating the pulsar signal during correlation to improve signal - to - noise ratios and performing ionospheric corrections based on multi - frequency phase fitting . with these improvements and using the vlba a parallax with better than @xmath48% accuracy",
    "was obtained for psr b0950 + 08 at a distance of 280 pc ( @xcite ) , and nine other pulsar parallaxes with distances between 160 and 1400 pc have been reported ( @xcite ) .    by observing at higher frequencies ( 5 ghz instead of 1.6 ghz ) , in order to reduce the effects of the ionosphere , higher accuracy pulsar parallaxes",
    "have been obtained , for example , for psr b0355 + 54 ( @xmath58 mas ) and psr b1929 + 10 ( @xmath59 mas ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite obtained results for 14 pulsars with the vlba , including a parallax for the most distance pulsar yet measured : psr b1514 + 09 with a parallax of @xmath60 mas , corresponding to a distance of @xmath61 kpc . with this sample , it is clear that most pulsars are moving away from the galactic plane with speeds of hundreds of .",
    "astrometry also provides a unique opportunity to constrain pulsar birth places through velocity and distance measurements .",
    "for instance , @xcite used a global vlbi array to measure the parallax and proper motion for psr b2021 + 51 , which ruled out the supernova remnant hb 21 as the origin of the pulsar , as it implied an improbable low age of only 700 years .",
    "similar studies have been performed by others ( @xcite ) .",
    "astrometric observations also provide information on the physical properties of pulsars .",
    "for example , @xcite combined a vlba parallax for psr b0656 + 14 with a thermal x - ray emission model to constrain the stellar radius between 13 and 20 km . @xcite",
    "measured a parallax for the transitional millisecond pulsar j1023 + 0038 with the vlba .",
    "their distance of @xmath62 pc was twice that predicted by the standard interstellar plasma model . when combined with timing and optical observations of this binary system , the new distance indicated a mass of @xmath63 , suggesting that it is a recycled pulsar .",
    "@xcite conducted astrometric observations of seven pulsars in the southern hemisphere using australian long baseline array ( lba ) .",
    "their new distance to psr j0630@xmath232834 required the efficiency of conversion of spin - down energy to x - rays to be less than 1% , an order of magnitude lower than previous estimates using a less accurate distance .",
    "magnetars , pulsars with extremely strong magnetic field , are also interesting astrometric targets .",
    "@xcite observed xte j1810@xmath23197 with the vlba and obtained a proper motion of 212 , suggesting that this magnetar has a lower space motion than theoretical predicted ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite found a similarly low space motion for the magnetar j1550@xmath235418 .    finally , pulsar astrometry can be critical for testing the constancy of physical parameters . using the vlba , @xcite observed j0437@xmath234715 , a milli - second binary pulsar with a white dwarf companion .",
    "they obtained a very precise parallax distance of @xmath64 pc .",
    "comparing this to a kinematic distance from pulsar timing gives strong limits on unmodeled accelerations , which provide a limit on the constancy of the gravitational constant of @xmath65 .",
    "this constraint is consistent with those obtained from lunar laser ranging as well as gravitational wave backgrounds .",
    "the algol system is an eclipsing binary ( with a period of 2.9 days , consisting of b8 v primary and k0 iv secondary ) and a distant companion with an orbital period of 1.86 yr .",
    "vlbi astrometry by @xcite revealed that the radio emission originates from the k0 subgiant and traced the orbital motion of eclipsing binary , indicating that the orbit of the binary is nearly orthogonal to that of the tertiary companion .",
    "observations of another hierarchical triple ( algol - like ) system , ux ari , by @xcite detected the acceleration of the tight binary caused by the tertiary star .",
    "this acceleration measurement dynamically constrains the mass of the tertiary to be @xmath66 , a value consistent with a spectroscopic identification of a k1 main - sequence star .    astrometric observations of radio stars allow one to accurately tie the fundamental radio and the optical reference frames .",
    "a comparison between the radio and preliminary hipparcos frames by @xcite revealed systematic discrepancies that could be removed by a global rotation ( and its time derivative ) .",
    "further vlbi observations by @xcite achieved parallax accuracies of @xmath67 mas for nine sources , whose distances ranged from 20 to 150 pc .",
    "@xcite monitored radio emission from colliding winds in cyg ob2#5 and obtained a marginal parallax of 0.61@xmath40.22 mas , consistent with other distance measurements of cyg x regions ( @xcite ) .",
    "these observations also revealed a high radio - brightness temperature ( @xmath68 k ) , providing information for modeling the stellar winds .",
    "the hyades and pleiades clusters play a pivotal role in quantitative astrophysics , serving as pillars of the astronomical distance ladder .",
    "recently , the hipparcos space mission , which measured @xmath69 stellar parallaxes with typical accuracies of @xmath70 mas , presented a ( revised ) parallax distance of @xmath71 pc for the pleiades ( @xcite ) .",
    "this result has been quite controversial , since a variety of other techniques , including main - sequence fitting , generally give distances between 131 and 135 pc .",
    "using the hst fine guidance sensor , @xcite measured _ relative _ trigonometric parallaxes for three pleiads , which , after correction to absolute parallaxes , average to a distance of @xmath72 pc .    in an attempt to provide a totally independent and straight - forward distance to the pleiades ,",
    "@xcite have used the vlba with the green bank and arecibo telescopes to measure _ absolute _ parallaxes to several pleiads that display compact radio emission .",
    "preliminary results suggest a cluster parallax near 138 pc , with an uncertainty of less than @xmath73 pc ( including measurement error and cluster depth effects ) .",
    "this result seems to rule out the hipparcos value , and it may even be in some tension with the ensemble of astrophysical - based distance indicators .",
    "since the source of error for the hipparcos parallax for the pleiades has not been convincingly established , there could be concern for the gaia mission , which is targeting a parallax accuracy of @xmath12 , since gaia might inherit some unknown systematics from hipparcos .",
    "intercomparison of high accuracy vlba parallaxes with those from gaia will provide a critical cross checking .",
    "sgr a * , the candidate super - massive black hole ( smbh ) at the center of the galaxy , is a strong radio source . it is precluded from optical view by @xmath74 mag of visual extinction but can sometimes be detected when flaring at 2.2 @xmath75 m wavelength ( through @xmath76 mag of extinction at this wavelength ) .",
    "astrometric observations in the infrared of stars orbiting an unseen mass have provided compelling evidence of a huge mass concentration , almost surely a black hole ( @xcite ) .",
    "these observations require a grid of sources with accurate positions relative to sgr a * to calibrate the infrared plate scale , rotation , and low - order distortion terms .",
    "the calibration sources have been provided by vla and vlba astrometric observations relative to the radio bright sgr a * of  and  masers in the circumstellar envelopes of red giant and supergiant stars within the central pc ( @xcite ) .",
    "this allowed location of the position of sgr a * on infrared images , which matched that of the gravitational focal position of the stellar orbits to @xmath77 mas accuracy , as well as confirming sgr a * s extremely low luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "astrometric observations of sgr a * at 7  mm wavelength , relative to background quasars with the vlba , yielded the angular motion of the sun about the galactic center and placed extremely stringent limits on the mass density of the smbh candidate . while stars orbiting sgr a * have been observed to move with speeds exceeding 5000  ( @xcite ) , the velocity component perpendicular to the galactic plane of sgr a * is less than @xmath77 , requiring that most of the @xmath78  required by the stellar orbits is tied to the radiative source sgr a * ( @xcite ) . since the millimeter wavelength emission from sgr",
    "a * is confined to a @xmath1 schwarzschild radii region ( @xcite ) , the implied mass density is approaching that theoretically expected for a black hole ( @xcite ) .",
    "the hubble constant , , is a critical cosmological parameter , not only for the extragalactic distance scale , but also for determining the flatness of the universe and the nature of dark energy .",
    "some active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with thin , edge - on accretion disks surrounding their central super - massive black hole ( smbh ) exhibit  `` megamaser '' emission , with bright maser spots coming from clouds in keplerian orbit about the smbh .",
    "astrometric observations can be used to map the positions and velocities of these clouds .",
    "coupled with time monitoring of the maser spectra , which allows direct measurement of cloud accelerations ( by tracking the velocity drift over time of maser features ) , one can obtain a geometric ( angular - diameter ) distance estimate for the galaxy .",

    "using recently improved values for the fundamental galactic parameters reduces the uncertainty in the binary orbital decay expected from gravitational radiation by nearly a factor of four compared to using the iau recommended values ( @xcite ) . the dominant uncertainty in the general relativistic test parameter is now dominated by the uncertainty in the pulsar distance , and a vlbi parallax for the binary accurate to @xmath97% would bring the contribution from distance uncertainty down to that of galactic parameter uncertainty .",

    "this is necessary in order to trace the 3-dimensional structure of the roughly one - third of the milky way that can not be observed from the north .",
    "the fundamental observable for a radio interferometer is the arrival time difference of wavefronts between antennas , owing to the finite propagation speed of electro - magnetic waves ( the speed of light @xmath122 ) .",
    "for an ideal interferometer , the arrival time difference is determined by the locations of the antennas with respect to the line - of - sight to the source and is referred to as the `` geometric delay . ''",
    "the basic equation of a radio interferometer , which relates the geometric delay , @xmath123 , to the source unit vector , @xmath124 , and the baseline vector , @xmath125 , is given by @xmath126 in * figure  [ fig : geometry ] * , we sketch the geometry of these vectors . note that while the source vector @xmath124 has two parameters (  right ascension and declination ) , the geometric delay is a scalar and so multiple measurements of geometric delays are required to solve for a source position .",
    "such measurements can be made , even with a single baseline , by utilizing the earth s rotation , which changes the orientation of the baseline vector with respect to the celestial frame .",
    "we now consider the effects of observational errors on astrometric accuracy . given the uncertainty in a delay measurement , which we denote @xmath127 , from equation [ eq : geometric - delay ] one can roughly estimate the astrometric error , @xmath128 : @xmath129 as seen in equation [ eq : delay - error ] , for a given @xmath127 , astrometric accuracy improves with longer baselines .",
    "this is the fundamental reason why vlbi , which utilizes continental and/or inter - continental baselines , can achieve the highest accuracy astrometry .",
    "for example , for an 8,000 km baseline and a typical delay error of @xmath492 cm ( converted to path length by @xmath130 ) , one expects an astrometric error of @xmath114 mas .",
    "this is a typical error for _ absolute _ astrometry , such as measuring qso positions in the icrf using broad - band delay measurements .",
    "for galaxy - scale parallaxes , however , this accuracy is insufficient as parallaxes can be @xmath131 mas , corresponding to distances of @xmath0 kpc . at such distances , one needs astrometric accuracy of @xmath48   to achieve @xmath48% uncertainty . in order to obtain -level accuracy",
    ", one must substantially cancel systematic delay errors through _ relative _ astrometry ,  a position measurement with respect to a nearby reference source .",
    "historically , the concept of relative astrometry has been attributed to galileo , who proposed measuring the parallax of a nearby star with respect to a more distant star located close by on the sky .",
    "the delay measured with an interferometer can be considered as the sum of the geometric delay ( which we would like to know ) and additional terms ( which need to removed from the data ) : @xmath132 here @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the delays in the propagation of the signal through the troposphere and ionosphere , respectively , @xmath135 is caused by an error in the location of an antenna , @xmath136 is an instrumental delay in the telescope or electronics , @xmath137 is the delay due to unmodeled source structure , and @xmath138 is the uncertainty in measuring delay caused by thermal noise .",
    "note that generally throughout this review the terms  delay  and  phase  ( or phase - delay ) can be used interchangeably : for instance , the interferometric phase caused by the geometric delay in equation [ eq : geometric - delay ] can be written as , @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the observing frequency .    for relative astrometry ,",
    "one observes two sources , the target and reference , at nearly the same time and nearly the same position on the sky , and differences the observed delays ( phases ) between the pair of sources .",
    "this type of observation is often referred to as `` phase - referencing , '' as the observed phase of the reference source is used to correct the phase of the target . applying equation  [ eq : tau - obs ] for the difference between two sources ,",
    "we obtain the delay difference observable : @xmath141 here subscripts 1 and 2 denote the quantities for the target and reference source , respectively .",
    "the first term is the difference in geometric delay between the source and reference , which corresponds to the relative position of the target source with respect to the reference source .",
    "the additional terms in the equation [ eq : delta - tau - obs ] may be reduced if they are similar for the two lines of sight . as will be discussed in detail later ,",
    "four terms ( @xmath142 , @xmath134 , @xmath143 , and @xmath136 ) are antenna - based quantities ( delays originated at each antenna ) and generally are similar for the target and reference lines of sight , for small source separations .",
    "antenna - based terms can be effectively reduced by phase - referencing .",
    "for example , the delay error generated by an antenna position offset , @xmath144 , is given by @xmath145 note the approximation used to obtain the right hand side of equation  [ eq : delay - ant ] is that the trigonometric terms in the vector dot product are generally @xmath146 .",
    "differencing the antenna delays for two adjacent sources , yields @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the separation angle between the sources .",
    "comparison of equations [ eq : delay - ant ] and [ eq : delta - delay - ant ] shows that the delay error caused by an antenna position error is reduced by a factor of @xmath148 in the differenced delay .",
    "this reduction can significantly improve _ relative _ over _ absolute _ astrometric accuracy .",
    "for a separation of @xmath149 , the error reduction factor ( @xmath148 ) is about 0.02 ( radians ) .    as we will discuss later in more detail ,",
    "the dominant error source in radio astrometry is uncompensated propagation delays , generally tropospheric for observing frequencies @xmath150 ghz and ionosphere for lower frequencies .",
    "these terms are `` antenna - based , '' just as the antenna location errors described above",
    ". a rough estimate of astrometric accuracy achievable in the presence of propagation delay errors is given by @xmath151 the reduction in position uncertainty in going from equation [ eq : delay - error ] to equation [ eq : delay - error - difference ] is , of course , the addition of the canceling term , @xmath148 . using the same example values previously used for absolute astrometry ,",
    "( @xmath152=8000 km and a delay error of @xmath153 cm ) , relative astrometric accuracy for a @xmath154 source separation is @xmath0 .",
    "uncompensated delay differences between antennas in an interferometric array usually limit radio astrometric accuracy . in this subsection , we discuss sources of delay errors individually .      the propagation speed of electro - magnetic waves in the troposphere is slower than in vacuum , causing an extra delay ( @xmath155 ) to be added to the geometric delay .",
    "the tropospheric delay is almost entirely non - dispersive ( frequency independent ) at radio frequencies .",
    "it is convenient to separate the tropospheric delay into two components based on the timescales of fluctuation : a slowly ( @xmath49 hours ) and rapidly ( @xmath49 minutes ) varying term .",
    "the rapidly varying term is associated with the passage of small `` clouds '' of water vapor flowing at wind speeds of @xmath156 m s@xmath6 at a characteristic height of @xmath1 km over each antenna .",
    "this can be the main cause of coherence loss in interferometric observations .",
    "the characteristic time scales for interferometer phase fluctuations induced by tropospheric water vapor can be described by the allan standard deviation ( @xmath157 ) and is typically @xmath158 over timescales of 1 to 100 sec ( @xcite ) .",
    "an interferometer coherence time , @xmath159 , can be defined as the time interval over which phase fluctuation differences between two antennas accumulate one radian . at an observing frequency @xmath140",
    ", this implies @xmath160 for @xmath161 and @xmath162 ghz , this implies a coherence time of @xmath94 sec .",
    "one must measure and remove the phase variations on a time - scale shorter than the coherence time .",
    "rapid switching between the target and calibrator sources can usually accomplish this , provided the antennas can slew and settle on sources rapidly ( see  [ sect : methods ] ) .",
    "the rapid variations from tropospheric delays can be completely removed if one can simultaneously observe the target and calibrate sources .",
    "this is done with the vera antennas , which have dual - beam observing systems . alternatively , this can also be accomplished if one is fortunate in finding a source pair with a very small angular separation , so that both fit within the primary beam of the antennas ( `` in - beam '' calibration ) . note that with either method , this still leaves a spatial variation component , but that term is generally smaller than the temporal term for source separations of a few degrees .",
    "the slowly varying delay term is generally associated with the `` dry '' part of the troposphere , although the slow term can also contain a small , relatively stable contribution from water vapor . at sea - level ,",
    "a typical path delay for the dry component is 230 cm at the zenith and water vapor can contribute up to a several tens of cm for very humid locations .",
    "the total dry delay can be estimated from antenna latitude and elevation , and if necessary using local temperature and pressure values .",
    "since the total dry delay is considerable , it is important to remove its effects during correlation , or early in post - correlation processing , by carefully accounting for the exact slant path through the atmosphere ( air mass ) , which will be different for the target and calibrator .",
    "the slowly varying wet component can not reliably be estimated from surface weather parameters and needs to be directly measured and removed to achieve  astrometry ( see  [ sect : geoblocks ] and  [ sect : gps ] for details ) .",
    "the ionosphere is a partially ionized layer located between @xmath163 and @xmath164 km altitude .",
    "an electromagnetic wave propagating through this plasma experiences phase and group delays that are frequency dependent ( dispersive delays ) . the phase and group delay are given by @xmath165 and @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the classical electron radius and @xmath168 is the electron column density along the line of sight or total electron content ( tec ) .",
    "due to the dispersive nature of plasma , delays are larger at lower frequency because of the @xmath169 dependence .",
    "( note that the ionospheric phase delay has the opposite sign of the group delay ; therefore correction of interferometer phase for ionospheric delays is different than for tropospheric delays . )",
    "the ionization of the ionosphere is predominantly from solar radiation , and thus there is a strong diurnal variation , as well as from the 11 year solar cycle . due to the diurnal variation",
    ", the ionospheric delay needs to be modeled ( or measured ) and calibrated on hour scales .",
    "modeling of the ionospheric delays is done by a combination of a vertical tec ( vtec ) and a mapping ( air mass like ) function .",
    "typical values for vtec range from a few to 100 tecu , where 1 tecu corresponds to an electron column density of @xmath170 m@xmath171 .",
    "once the tec toward a source is known , the ionospheric delay ( in path length units ) can be calculated by the following relation , @xmath172 at a frequency of 22 ghz , a 50 tecu column density causes a delay equivalent to an extra path length of @xmath173 cm , but it reaches @xmath174 cm at a frequency of 2 ghz .    because of the dispersive nature of the ionospheric delay , dual - frequency observations are effective for calibration .",
    "most geodetic measurements involve simultaneous observations at 2.3 and 8.4 ghz in order to calculate and then remove ionospheric delays .",
    "another way to measure ionospheric tec values is to use gps data , which provide dual - frequency signals at 1.23 and 1.58 ghz .",
    "several services accumulate gps data from stations around the earth and provide global tec models approximately every two hours .",
    "generally , radio interferometric data are calibrated for ionospheric delays using these models .",
    "radio propagation in antenna structures , feeds , and electronics causes additional delays , which we lump together as `` instrumental delays '' ( @xmath175 ) .",
    "in addition , there are electronic phase offsets associated with the generation of the local oscillators used to mix the observed frequencies to `` intermediate '' frequencies ( @xmath1 ghz ) prior to correlation .",
    "the data recorded at each antenna are time - tagged using a clock tied to the fundamental frequency standard at each station ( usually a hydrogen maser atomic oscillator ) , and owing to slight frequency offsets ( that do not affect local oscillator stability ) these clocks generally gain or lose time at a rate of one part in @xmath176 ( only @xmath1 nsec per day ! ) . however",
    ", a delay error of 1 nsec causes a phase slope of @xmath177 radians across a 500 mhz observational bandwidth , and it is critical to correct for this .",
    "calibration observations using `` geodetic blocks '' ( see  [ sect : geoblocks ] ) can remove clock errors to an accuracy of @xmath178 nsec .",
    "other instrumental delay and phase offsets are generally relatively slowly varying , for well designed systems and temperature controlled electronics , and can be calibrated and removed by observations of strong sources a few times a day .",
    "any residual instrumental delay and phase offsets will be mostly canceled when switching between two sources , provided the electronics are not changed .",
    "note that if one of the sources is a spectral line and the other a continuum emitter , one should try to place the line near the center of the continuum band to ensure better calibration . on the other hand ,",
    "if the two sources are observed with different receivers , which is the case for dual - beam receiving at vera , there is a need for additional calibration of the instrumental delay and phase , such as by using an artificial noise source ( see  [ sect : methods ] ) .",
    "the antenna position is usually defined as the intersection of azimuth and elevation axes and can be measured to an accuracy of @xmath76 mm with regular geodetic observations .",
    "the earth s rotation rate varies ( measured as a time correction , ut1@xmath23utc ) as does the location of an antenna on the earth s crust with respect to its spin axis ( polar motion ) .",
    "together these are called earth orientation parameters ( eop ) .",
    "eop values are determined on a daily basis by the international earth rotation and reference systems service ( iers ) by utilizing global gps data and geodetic vlbi observations .",
    "a typical error in eop values is @xmath18 mas , provided the final ( not preliminary or extrapolated ) values are used . with high accuracy antenna locations and eop corrections , the total uncertainty in the position of an antenna contributes less to the astrometric error budget than uncertainty in atmospheric propagation delays .",
    "if the observed sources are not point like , interferometric delay / phase can be affected by source structure .",
    "since structure phase shifts are independent for the target and reference sources , their effects do not cancel when differencing the phases in relative astrometry .",
    "source structure phases are baseline - based quantities . because there are @xmath179 baselines for @xmath180 antennas in an array , structure phase can be separated from station - based quantities and estimated using self - calibration ( closure techniques and hybrid - mapping ) .",
    "once a source image is obtained , phase shifts caused by source structure can be calculated and subtracted from observed interferometric data . note",
    "that since self - calibration loses absolute position information , if one self - calibrates the reference source data , one must apply the _ same _ calibrations to both the reference and target source to preserve relative astrometric accuracy .",
    "generally it is not a good idea to self - calibrate the target source data , but instead measure the structure in the phase - referenced images .",
    "thermal ( usually dominated by receiver ) noise is random and can not be calibrated and removed .",
    "however , a random process does not cause systematic offsets , and by integrating over many samples its effects can be reduced . thermal noise in an interferometric image leads to position measurement uncertainty given by equation  [ eq : geometric - delay ] of @xcite : @xmath181 for a baseline length @xmath182 km and observing wavelength @xmath183 cm , the synthesized beam ( fwhm ) size is @xmath184 mas .",
    "thus , for a source with an image signal - to - noise ratio @xmath185 , the expected position error due to thermal noise is only @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , thermal noise often is not a major source of radio astrometric error .",
    "several methods of phase - referencing are commonly used : source switching , dual - beam , and in - beam observations .",
    "source switching or `` nodding '' is the most - commonly used observing method , because it does not require a special radio telescope and can be used for all source pairs .",
    "the only requirement is that slewing / settling times are short enough to track tropospheric phase fluctuations . as discussed in ",
    "[ sect : troposphere ] , coherence times at an observing frequency of 22 ghz are @xmath94 sec",
    ". therefore switching cycles should be shorter than this time ,  a cycle of 60 sec obtained by integrating for 20 sec on the reference , 10 sec for slewing to the target , integrating for 20 sec on the target , then 10 sec for slewing back to the reference . because of the non - dispersive nature of tropospheric delays , the interferometer coherence time scales linearly with wavelength , i.e. , @xmath186 .",
    "hence at a short wavelengths , the coherence time can be problematic .",
    "for an observing wavelength of @xmath183 mm ( @xmath187 ghz ) , the coherence time is likely to be @xmath0 sec .",
    "this makes it practically impossible to conduct switched vlbi observations at @xmath146 mm wavelength .    in dual - beam observations , two sources",
    "are observed simultaneously using independent feeds and receivers .",
    "this can be done using multi - feed systems on a single antenna , as with vera , or with multiple antennas at each site ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is no gap between the observations of the target and reference sources , and hence there is no coherence loss owing to temporal phase fluctuations .",
    "the antennas of the vera array achieve this with two receivers installed at the cassegrain focus .",
    "these receivers are independently steerable with a steward - mount platform , and one can observe a source pair with separation angles between @xmath188 to @xmath189 . in dual - beam radio astrometry , special care needs to be taken to calibrate the instrumental delay , because it is not common to the target and reference source and thus will not cancel when phase - referencing .",
    "in - beam observations can be regarded as a special case of phase - referencing , where the target and reference sources are so closely located that the two sources can be observed simultaneously with a single feed ( within the primary beam of each antenna ) .",
    "in such a case , calibration error can be very effectively reduced , because the observations are done at the same time for the target and reference , and , because the separation angle is small , most systematic errors are largely canceled . however , finding a sufficiently strong reference source may be difficult ; as such in - beam observations are more common at lower observing frequencies , as the primary beam becomes larger and the reference sources stronger .",
    "for parameters typical of cm - wavelength vlbi observations seeking to measure relative positions between two sources separated by @xmath190 with @xmath87  accuracy , phase reference sources should have coordinates known to @xmath83 mas , antenna locations known to @xmath146 cm , and electronic , clock and propagation delays known to @xmath191 nsec .",
    "tropospheric ( non - dispersive ) delays are usually calibrated by one of two methods : 1 ) using geodetic - like observing blocks or 2 ) using gps data .",
    "one can use observations of radio sources spread over the sky to measure broad - band ( group ) delays . for sources with positions known to better than @xmath77  mas , group delay residuals",
    "will generally be dominated by the effects of tropospheric ( and at low frequencies ionospheric ) mis - modeling , provided the geometric model for the array is accurate to better than @xmath70 cm ( including antenna locations , earth orientation parameters and solid - earth tides ) . by observing @xmath87 sources over a range of source azimuths and , most importantly , elevations in rapid succession ( @xmath192 min ) , one can estimate residual `` zenith '' tropospheric delays at each telescope .",
    "these observing blocks are similar to those used for geodetic vlbi observations to determine source and telescope positions , as well as earth s orientation parameters and , hence , are called `` geodetic blocks . ''",
    "the observing sequence can be determined by monte carlo simulations of large numbers of blocks and choosing the block with the lowest expected zenith - delay uncertainties .",
    "operationally , it may be best to choose sources above an elevation of @xmath193 and available at a minimum of about @xmath194% of the telescopes in the array .",
    "geodetic blocks should be placed before the start , during ( roughly every 2 hours ) , and at the end of phase - reference observations .",
    "this allows one to monitor slow changes in the total tropospheric delay for each telescope . in order to measure group delays accurately",
    ", the observations should span the maximum if bandwidth , spaced in a `` minimum redundancy pattern '' to uniformly sample , as best as possible , all frequency differences . for a system with 8 if bands , this can be accomplished with bands spaced by 0 , 1 , 4 , 9 , 15 , 22 , 32 and 34 units .",
    "if the recording system limited to @xmath195 mhz if bandwidth , the unit separation would be @xmath196 mhz .",
    "with such a setup , estimated zenith delays are generally accurate to @xmath197 nsec ( @xmath77  cm of propagation path - delay )",
    ". comparisons of the geodetic block technique with those using global positioning system ( gps ) data and an image - optimization approach confirm this accuracy ( @xcite ) .",
    "residual multi - band ( group ) delays and fringe rates are modeled as owing to a vertical tropospheric delay and delay - rate , as well as a clock offset and clock drift rate , at each antenna .",
    "note that the geodetic blocks need not be observed at the same frequency as the phase - referencing observations . if one has independent calibration of ionospheric ( dispersive ) delays ( see  [ sect : ionosphere ] ) , then it is simplest to observe the geodetic blocks at a frequency ( @xmath140 ) above @xmath198 ghz to avoid contamination of the group delays by residual ionospheric effects , which decline approximately as @xmath199 .",
    "however , if one is limited to one ( wide - band ) receiver , then for observing frequencies below about @xmath87 ghz , it is important to remove unmodeled ionospheric contributions to the geodetic group delays , since correction of interferometer phases has a different sign for dispersive compared to non - dispersive delays",
    ". this can be accomplished with `` dual - frequency '' geodetic blocks as outlined in ",
    "[ sect : ionosphere ] .",
    "the gps is a navigation system used to determine an accurate three - dimensional position for an observer on the earth .",
    "the system consists of more than 20 satellites constituting an artificial `` constellation '' of reference sources .",
    "accurate positions of the satellites are broadcast by radio transmission to receivers on earth .",
    "the basic principles for position determination using gps signals is similar to geodetic vlbi : the receiver position can be accurately determined based on delay measurements from multiple satellites . since the broadcasts are at low frequencies ( 1.2 to 1.6 ghz ) , propagation delays in the ionosphere strongly affect the data .",
    "dual frequencies allow removal of the ionospheric ( dispersive ) delay , and by observing several gps satellites at different slant - paths through the atmosphere simultaneously , one can solve for the tropospheric delay as well as the receiver position .",
    "as such , one can use gps data to calibrate tropospheric delays .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have conducted detailed comparisons of tropospheric delay measurements by gps and geodetic - mode vlbi ( see  [ sect : geoblocks ] ) observations ; both studies conclude that the difference between the two methods are small , @xmath200 cm , with no systematic differences .      in principle ,",
    "the effects of ionospheric ( dispersive ) delays can be largely removed by using global models of the total electron content ( @xcite ) , by direct use of gps data at each antenna , or from dual - frequency geodetic block observations . because the ionosphere is confined to a shell far above the earth s surface , rays from the source to a telescope",
    "can penetrate the ionosphere far from the telescope location on the earth s surface .",
    "this generally favors using global models , based on smoothed results from a grid of gps stations , over measurements made only at the vlbi telescopes .",
    "however , this is an area of current development and the methods of dispersive delay calibration may improve .",
    "if one observes at frequencies below @xmath87 ghz , one can in principle obtain both dispersive and non - dispersive delays simultaneously from `` wide - band '' geodetic blocks .",
    "for example , with receivers covering 4 to 8 ghz , one can generate two separate sets of geodetic block data : spanning 500 mhz centered at the low end of the band ( @xmath201 ghz ) and at the high end of the band ( @xmath202 ghz ) .",
    "this gives observables  and , which contain both dispersive and non - dispersive delays ( eg , tropospheric delays and clock terms ) .",
    "differencing @xmath203 and @xmath204 values for all sources and baselines yields the dispersive contribution .",
    "the dispersive contribution can be used to model the ionospheric contribution and , importantly , can be scaled and subtracted from the @xmath204 delays to produce pure non - dispersive delays .",
    "the non - dispersive delays can then be modeled as described in  [ sect : troposphere ] to solve for pure tropospheric and clock terms .",
    "note , that if one uses observations of a strong continuum source ( fringe finder ) to remove electronic delay differences among if sub - bands (  zeroing the delay on the fringe finder scan ) , this must be taken into account when modeling the dispersive delays .",
    "an alternative to direct measurement is to use global maps of total ionospheric electron content generated from gps data .",
    "global ionosphere maps ( gims ) are produced on a regular basis by several groups , such as nasa , eas , code , and ucp , who provide gims every two hours .",
    "basic trends in these global maps are generally consistent with each other , although there are differences in scale for tec values . also note that currently gims have a typical angular resolution of 2.5 deg , and thus small scale fluctuations in the ionosphere may not be well traced .",
    "@xcite compared tec values obtained by gps and direct measurements ( such as with jason and topex ) and found vertical tec values among the methods differ at the @xmath205% level . for a 50 tecu zenith column and an error of @xmath12% ,",
    "the uncertainty in the ionospheric delay correction would be @xmath1 cm at an observing frequency of 22 ghz , which is slightly smaller than the delay error caused by the troposphere .",
    "on the other hand , at frequencies below 10 ghz the ionosphere is the dominant contributor to the delay error budget , even after corrections with gims are applied .      for a dual - beam receiving system ,",
    "an additional calibration is required , because the propagation paths through the antenna and electronics are independent for the target and reference sources . at vera ,",
    "the horn - on - dish method is utilized ( @xcite ) , in which an artificial noise source is mounted on an antenna s main reflector and a common signal is injected into both receivers . during observations , cross - correlation of the noise source between the two receivers is monitored in real - time , so that one can trace the time variation of the instrumental delay difference .",
    "the measured delay difference between the two receivers can be applied in post - processing . @xcite",
    "have conducted tests of the horn - on - dish calibration and found that the vera system can measure instrumental ( path ) delay differences to an accuracy of @xmath206 mm , more than adequate for 10  relative astrometry .",
    "the error in the position of the source used as the phase reference causes an error in its delay / phase measurements , and these errors are then propagated to the target source .",
    "the effect of a reference source position offset differs from other errors previously discussed .",
    "the first order effect is that the position offset of the reference source is transferred to the target source position . if the reference source has negligible proper motion and parallax , this only introduces a constant term , which is absorbed when fitting for parallax and proper motion .",
    "this is why we do not include such a term in equation ( [ eq : tau - obs ] ) .",
    "however , if the reference source position offset becomes large ( @xmath150 mas ) , there are additional second - order effects which come from the fact that the target and reference sources are separated on the sky . because they are at different positions , the interferometer phase response to a position offset at one position on the sky does not exactly mimic the response at the other position .",
    "these second order effects lead to a small position error and to degraded image quality . for an interferometric fringe spacing of 1 mas and a pair separation of @xmath154 , one radian of second order phase - shift results from a calibrator position offset of @xmath0 mas ( this offset , @xmath207 ,",
    "can be estimated by @xmath208 ) . in general , for phase - referencing astrometry , one needs to know the calibrator position with an accuracy of @xmath99 mas . for a finer beam size or larger separation angle ,",
    "the required positional accuracy is even higher .",
    "there are several methods for determining the absolute position of a phase reference source .",
    "if one can find a compact icrf radio source ( with @xmath209 mas ) close to the target source , one can transfer the position accuracy to the phase - reference source . however , icrf sources are sparsely distributed on the sky and some",
    "are heavily resolved on long interferometer baselines . in such cases",
    ", one should include an icrf source in the phase - referenced observations , even if offset by up to about @xmath210 from the other sources used for differential astrometry , in order to determine their positions . even if using a distant icrf source as a reference produces poor images for other sources , one can usually obtain @xmath1 mas accurate positions ( and then discard the icrf source data ) .",
    "alternatively , one can do preparatory observations to measure the position of a phase reference source .",
    "usually connected - element interferometers (  jvla , emerlin , or the atca ) , which are limited in baseline length to @xmath211 km , can yield absolute positions with accuracies between 0.01 and 1 arcsec . while this is usually adequate for vlbi data correlation , it is not good enough for high accuracy vlbi astrometry . instead , vlbi observations using broad - band group - delay observables ( as done for icrf campaigns ) are preferable .    if a maser source is to serve as the phase reference , then broad - band group - delays can not be measured , since spectral lines are intrinsically very narrow , leading to large uncertainty in group - delay estimates .",
    "in this case , it is best to use an icrf source to transfer positional accuracy via phase - referencing . as a last resort , if no qualified source is available , one can attempt to synthesize a maser spot image _ without _ phase - referencing .",
    "if the vlbi data have been correlated ( or later corrected ) with a model accurate to a few wavelengths of path delay , then such an image will resemble optical speckles ( caused by short - term phase fluctuations induced by tropospheric water fluctuations and instabilities in the frequency standard ) .",
    "however , the centroid of these speckles can often be determined to @xmath0 mas , which may be sufficient for the position of the phase reference .",
    "often the dominant source of systematic error is uncompensated tropospheric delays . at any telescope , if one misestimates the zenith (  @xmath212 ) tropospheric delay by @xmath213 , this error is magnified at larger zenith angles by a factor of @xmath214 . the differential effect between the target and a background source , with a zenith angle difference of @xmath215 ,",
    "is then given by @xmath216 .",
    "note that @xmath217 increases dramatically at large zenith angles where both @xmath218 and @xmath219 tend to diverge .",
    "for example , the ratio of differential delay error @xmath217 at @xmath220 to @xmath221 is a factor of 8.0 .",
    "this suggests that astrometric observations should be limited , whenever possible , to small zenith angles .",
    "of course , when restricting observations to small zenith angles , one must balance the loss of interferometer -coverage , which affects both sensitivity and image fidelity , against increasing systematic errors that come with large zenith angle observations . in practice",
    ", it may prove valuable to fully simulate interferometric observations in order to estimate an optimum zenith angle limit for the declination of a given target source and the orientation and separation on the sky of the background source .",
    "perhaps the simplest method of measuring a position from radio interferometric data is to work in the image domain .",
    "this involves placing the visibility  data on a grid , performing a 2-dimensional fourier transformation to sky coordinates ,  @xmath222 , deconvolving the resulting `` dirty '' map using the `` dirty '' beam ( point source response ) with the  algorithm , and fitting a 2-dimensional gaussian brightness distribution to compact emission components .",
    "this provides offsets , , from the map center , whose absolute position is defined by the position used when cross - correlating the interferometer data and any subsequent shifts applied during calibration .",
    "care must be taken in both shifting positions and interpreting the measured offsets from the map center , to properly account for the effects of precession , nutation , aberration and even general relativistic ray bending near the sun .",
    "for example , position shifts applied to -data are best done by calculating the full interferometric delay and phase for the desired source position and subtracting those values for the original ( correlator ) position .",
    "simply calculating a differential correction can lead to significant astrometric errors .",
    "similarly , one should not simply add map offsets ,  ( which `` know nothing '' of physical effects ) to the map - center coordinates , without correcting for differential precession , nutation , and aberration , unless the map offsets are very small .",
    "for example , over time scales of less than a few years , neglecting differential effects generally leads to position errors of @xmath223 .",
    "so , to ensure astrometric accuracies of @xmath1 ,  values should be @xmath99 mas .",
    "therefore , if one measures large  values in a map , one should ( accurately ) shift positions in the -data , re - image , and re - measure the offsets .",
    "space - vlbi involves using a radio antenna in orbit around the earth to obtain baselines lengths greater than an earth diameter .",
    "as is clear from equation [ eq : delay - error ] , for fixed delay uncertainty one gains astrometric accuracy as the baseline length increases . for space vlbi to improve on earth - based astrometry , the satellite position ( orbit determination )",
    "must be determined to @xmath1 cm accuracy , which is very challenging . however , the complementary application of using vlbi to accurately track spacecraft holds great promise ( @xcite ) .",
    "vsop / halca was a space - vlbi mission launched in 1997 .",
    "using vsop , @xcite conducted space - vlbi astrometry of the radio qso pair b1342 + 662/b1342 + 663 ( which are only 5 arcmin apart ) and demonstrated that the satellite position error was @xmath224 meters and that the useful astrometry could be accomplished only for very close pairs .",
    "because of the poor performance of the vsop 22 ghz receiving system , maser astrometry was not attempted .",
    "currently the russian space - vlbi satellite , radioastron , is in orbit ( with a maximum interferometric baseline of @xmath225 km , comparable to the earth - moon separation ) .",
    "fringes from space - baselines have been obtained ( @xcite ) and , perhaps , high - accuracy space - vlbi astrometry can be realized .      at millimeter and",
    "sub - mm wavelengths , vlbi can achieve an angular resolution sufficient to resolve event - horizon scales for nearby super - massive black holes .",
    "a prediction of general relativity is that at this scale one should see the `` shadow '' of the black hole ( @xcite ) .",
    "impressive results have been achieved using _ ad hoc _ arrays of antennas that can observe at the short wavelengths required to `` see through '' a screen of electrons that blurs the image of sgr  a * , the super - massive black hole at the center of the milky way ( @xcite ) .",
    "the event horizon telescope is a world - wide collaboration to realize a powerful vlbi array operating at 1 mm or shorter wavelengths , anchored by the phased - alma ( acting as a single telescope with great collecting area ) .",
    "in addition to imaging event horizon scales for sgr  a * and m  87 , one should be able to explore the detailed structure of accretion disks and jet launching points in the vicinity of these super - massive black holes using multi - frequency astrometry .",
    "@xcite investigated the possibility of such observations by using the sub - array mode of alma , sma , carma and other telescopes and demonstrated that astrometry at the @xmath224  level is possible . with such accuracy one",
    "can trace positional variations of the black holes owing to perturbations from surrounding stars and/or a black hole companion .",
    "in addition , one should be able to monitor structural variations occurring on dynamical timescales of the innermost stable circular orbit , which for sgr  a * would be @xmath0 min .      the square kilometer array ( ska ) is a world - wide project to build and operate the next generation of radio interferometers with an aggregate collecting area @xmath1 km@xmath118 . achieving the ska will likely require three independent arrays , using different technologies to cover the frequency range of @xmath94 mhz to @xmath226 ghz .",
    "micro - arcsecond astrometry can be achieved at frequencies above @xmath224 ghz , provided baselines of several thousand km are an integral part of the design . for astrometric observations ,",
    "the ska holds the promise of significantly increased relative positional accuracy , because its great sensitivity allows the use of weak calibrators much closer in angle on the sky to the astrometric target .",
    "compared to the vlba , for example , the increased sensitivity of the full ska should allow the use of background compact radio sources at least an order of magnitude closer to the target , resulting in astrometric accuracy better than @xmath70  !",
    "in addition , if multi - beam feeds are used on individual antennas , one could simultaneously observe many sources , greatly increasing astrometric survey speed .",
