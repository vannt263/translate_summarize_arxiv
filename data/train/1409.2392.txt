    "the electron spin confined in semiconductor qds is a promising candidate for the realization of quantum computing and the development of spin - based devices in spintronics.@xcite using the spin of electrons as qubits was first proposed by loss and divincenzo ( ref . ) and , since then , a lot of effort has been devoted to its accomplishment.@xcite qds offer the possibility of isolating single electron spins which exhibit longer lifetimes than in delocalized systems since quantum confinement suppresses the main bulk decoherence mechanisms.@xcite nevertheless , coupling between the electron spin and the surrounding environment can not be avoided , resulting in spin relaxation and decoherence .",
    "therefore , a good understanding of the relaxation mechanisms in qds is needed for the development of spin - based applications .",
    "the two main mechanisms of spin relaxation in iii - v zinc - blende semiconductor qds are the hyperfine coupling with the nuclear spins of the lattice and the spin - orbit interaction ( soi).@xcite the hyperfine interaction is generally important at relatively weak magnetic fields while for moderate and strong fields the phonon - mediated relaxation due to soi predominates . in semiconductors without inversion symmetry , e.g. gaas , soi can be originated by the bulk inversion asymmetry of the material ( dresselhaus soi)@xcite and the structure inversion asymmetry of the confining potential ( rashba soi).@xcite the hamiltonians describing both soi have different symmetries and exhibit an anisotropic behavior.@xcite this anisotropy can be exploited to externally control and manipulate the electron spin by changing the orientation of applied magnetic or electric fields.@xcite as a consequence , the anisotropy of the spin relaxation and its control via external means has been intensively studied.@xcite    most works so far have dealt with two - dimensional ( 2d ) parabolic inas or gaas qds grown along the [ 001 ] crystal direction,@xcite where in - plane anisotropy arises from the interference between rashba and dresselhaus soi . however , realistic qds are prone to deviate from the circular symmetry and there is gathering evidence that this has a primary influence on the spin relaxation anisotropy.@xcite yet , previous works on this aspect neglected cubic dresselhaus soi terms , whose role may be important .",
    "cubic terms are expected to become particularly important in qds with large height - to - base aspect ratio@xcite , which are increasingly available owing to recent progress in synthetic control.@xcite going beyond [ 001 ] grown qds is also of interest , especially in view of the convenience of [ 111 ] grown qds for optical spin preparation.@xcite the effect of the crystallographic orientation on the spin dynamics has been well studied in quantum wells@xcite , but further work is needed in relation to fully localized spins .    in this work , we study the anisotropy of the electron spin relaxation between zeeman sublevels in cuboidal gaas qds .",
    "the anisotropy is monitored by varying the orientation of an externally applied in - plane magnetic field ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "we consider qds grown along both [ 001 ] and [ 111 ] crystal directions , including all linear and cubic terms of rashba and dresselhaus soi in a fully 3d model .",
    "different heights , base shapes , crystallographic orientations and external electric fields are considered .",
    "the numerical results , together with perturbative interpretations , provide a wide overview on the effect of confinement asymmetry and three - dimensionality on the spin relaxation anisotropy .",
    "we find that , in [ 001 ] grown qds , the spin relaxation anisotropy is very different depending on the dominating spin - orbit mechanism , rashba or dresselhaus soi . by contrast , in [ 111 ] grown qds the anisotropy is the same for both terms . in all cases ,",
    "the spin relaxation rate shows strong oscillations with @xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , cubic dresselhaus terms are shown to be critical in determining such anisotropic behavior .",
    "this occurs not only in high qds , but ",
    "contrary to common belief  also in quasi-2d qds , provided the high symmetry directions of the dot are not aligned with the main crystallographic axes . in both squared and rectangular qds we observe order - of - magnitude suppressions of the spin relaxation rate at certain `` magic '' magnetic field angles @xmath0 , which can be understood from symmetry considerations .",

    "[ fig3](a ) , we analyze the spin relaxation in the only presence of dresselhaus soi for qds with square base .",
    "the relaxation rate for small qds ( @xmath58 ) is almost isotropic with the orientation of the magnetic field .",

    "again , the dependence on @xmath0 is different depending on the dot height . when @xmath65 is oriented along the direction of weaker confinement the relaxation is minimum for qds with @xmath58 , but it changes into a maximum for @xmath66 .",
    "the preceding results reveal a strong sensitivity of the spin relaxation anisotropy to both the qd symmetry ( squared or rectangular ) and the qd height . both factors can induce major , qualitative changes in the anisotropy . to understand such a behavior , we consider that the relaxation rate is proportional to the degree of spin admixture of the initial and final states of the transition , @xmath67 and @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( [ fermieq]).@xcite these states can be approximated as : @xmath69 where @xmath70 represents the electron orbital in the absence of soi , with @xmath71 the number of nodes in @xmath9 , @xmath72 and @xmath25 , respectively , while @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) represents parallel ( antiparallel ) spin alignment along the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "for the analysis we can focus on @xmath67 ( analogous reasoning is valid for @xmath68 ) .",
    "@xmath67 is mostly a spin down state , with a little soi induced spin admixture with excited levels .",
    "notice that @xmath75 does not contribute to the spin admixture of @xmath67 because the parity symmetry in @xmath9 and @xmath72 prevents direct soi coupling with @xmath76 .",
    "thus , the degree of spin admixture is essentially captured by the coefficients @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which can be estimated perturbatively as : @xmath79 and @xmath80 the energy separations @xmath81 and @xmath82 do not vary with @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the origin of the anisotropy must be sought in the soi matrix elements .",
    "we consider first rashba soi , i.e. @xmath83}(0)$ ] . from eq .",
    "( [ rashrotz ] ) and parity considerations , it follows that , for @xmath84 , @xmath85 while for @xmath86 , @xmath87 we see that depending on the orientation of the magnetic field the spin admixture is caused by the coupling to a different excited state . for qds with square base @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",
    "consequently , the degree of spin mixing does not change at @xmath84 and @xmath86 , in agreement with the isotropic @xmath90 observed in fig .",
    "conversely , in rectangular qds with stronger confinement in @xmath9 , @xmath91 . then , the admixture coefficients at @xmath86 are larger than at @xmath84 , which justifies the anisotropy observed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",

    "if we perform a similar analysis for @xmath96 as the one carried out for rashba soi , we find that coupling to @xmath97 and @xmath98 dominates at @xmath84 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "this is exactly the opposite as for the rashba soi case , explaining the results obtained for @xmath58 qds ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ) . as the qd height",
    "is increased , however , @xmath99 soon dominates over @xmath96 . indeed",
    ", for @xmath61 it is already dominant .",
    "considering individually @xmath100 and @xmath101 it can be shown that they present opposite behaviors with @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath100 produces a maximum ( minimum ) relaxation for @xmath86 ( @xmath84 ) and @xmath100 for @xmath84 ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "this dependence does not change with the base shape and a stronger confinement in one direction only determines which term , @xmath100 or @xmath101 , prevails .",

    "[ fig3](b ) , @xmath102 so @xmath100 is more important and we observe its angular dependence . instead , when the dot base is squared @xmath100 and @xmath101 cancel each other out at @xmath63 and @xmath64 , thus giving rise to the pronounced minima of @xmath60 observed in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .    to summarize this section ,",
    "the spin relaxation anisotropy of [ 001 ] grown gaas qds is determined by the spin admixture induced by soi .",
    "this is qualitatively different in systems where rashba or dresselhaus soi terms dominate . in the latter case ,",
    "the anisotropy reflects whether @xmath96 or @xmath99 prevails .",
    "it turns out that @xmath99 is already dominant for @xmath61 ( height - to - base aspect ratio of 1:4 ) , which points out at the early relevance of cubic dresselhaus terms in structures where three - dimensionality starts becoming important . in this case , the use of qds with symmetric x - y confinement enables strong suppressions of the relaxation at certain magnetic field orientations .",
    "these `` magic '' angles are reminiscent of the `` easy passages '' found by stano and fabian for laterally coupled circular qds.@xcite in this and the following sections we show that related physics arises for single qds with non - circular confinement , which has significant practical implications .      in this section ,",
    "we investigate the impact of the qd orientation with respect to the crystal host on the spin relaxation .",

    "in particular , one can see some specific rotation angles , @xmath104 , where the spin relaxation is reduced by 4 - 5 orders of magnitude as compared to others .",
    "this behavior can be understood from the form of the hamiltonian in eq .  .",
    "the dresselhaus soi presents a @xmath105 dependence , with half of the terms multiplied by @xmath106 and the other half by @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , the first part of eq .   cancels for @xmath108 and the second part for @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "this suppresses some of the soi coupling channels , giving rise to slower relaxation rate than for intermediate angles .",

    ", the inset shows that even in the shortest qds ( @xmath58 ) , save for the vicinity of the `` magic '' rotation angles ( @xmath111 ) the main contribution to the relaxation rate does not come from @xmath96 but from @xmath99 .",

    "<S> the origin of these angles can be traced back to the symmetries of the spin admixing terms of the hamiltonian . in [ 001 ] grown qds , the suppression angles are different for rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit terms . by contrast , in [ 111 ] grown qds they are the same , which should facilitate a thorough suppression of spin - orbit induced relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> our results evidence that cubic dresselhaus terms play a critical role in determining the spin relaxation anisotropy even in quasi-2d qds . </S>"
