    "problems of the form arise in a variety of physical , biological and chemical applications @xcite .",
    "problem describes slow or anomalous sub - diffusion and occurs , for example , in models of fractured or porous media , where the particle flux depends on the entire history of the density gradient@xmath26 .",
    "the nonlocal nature of the fractional derivative operator @xmath20 means that on each time subinterval , one must efciently evaluate a sum of integrals over all previous time subintervals .",
    "thus , reducing the number of time steps as much as possible and maintaining high accuracy of the discrete solutions are important .",
    "so , the most obvious thing is to propose efficient high order methods for the model problem . in this work",
    "we investigate ( for the first time to the best of our knowledge ) a high order accurate ( unconditionally stable ) time - stepping numerical method for problem .",
    "however , due to the typical singular behaviour of  @xmath17 near  @xmath27  @xcite , high order methods can fail to achieve fast convergence . to this end",
    ", we propose to deal with the accuracy issue ( in time ) by developing a high order dpg method that allows for the singular behaviour of  @xmath17 , by employing non - uniform time steps .",
    "an important feature of the dpg method is that it allows for locally varying time - steps and approximation orders which are beneficial to handle problems with low regularity .",
    "the dpg method was introduced initially for solving first order odes in @xcite .",
    "later on , dpg methods were investigated by several authors for solving various problems .",
    "for instance , for advection - diffusion and elliptic problems , see @xcite , for transport equations see @xcite , and refer to @xcite for volterra integro - differential equations with smooth memory . here",
    ", we extend the original dpg method in @xcite to discretize in time the fractional diffusion problem .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we combine the time - stepping dpg with the continuous finite elements ( fes ) in space , which will then define a fully discrete computable scheme .",
    "existence , uniqueness and stability of our numerical scheme will be provided . for the error analysis",
    ", we show convergence rates of order @xmath28 in the @xmath1-norm , where @xmath6 is the maximum time step , @xmath7 is the maximum diameter of the spatial finite elements , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the degrees of approximate solutions in time and spatial variables , respectively . the main difficulty in our stability and error analysis is due to the trouble from the time discretization . in this direction , we make full use of several important properties of the operator @xmath20 ; see lemma [ lemma : positivity - equal-0 ] . in contrast , for @xmath29 , the considered time stepping dpg scheme amounts to a generalized post - processed crank - nicolson scheme .",
    "to validate the achieved theoretical results , a series of numerical results will be given at the end of the paper .",
    "since in the present work our emphasis is on convergence properties rather than algorithmic implementation , in our numerical experiments we do not use the fast algorithm .",
    "a direct implementation of the considered method requires @xmath30 operations and requires @xmath31 storage , owing to the presence of the memory term , where @xmath32 is the number of time mesh elements and @xmath33 is the spatial degrees of freedom . proposing a fast algorithm for evaluating",
    "the discrete solution is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "this will be a topic for future research .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : numerical - method ] introduces a fully discrete dpg - fe scheme . in section  [ sec : existence - uniqueness ] , using appropriately the positivity , coercivity , and continuity properties of the operator @xmath34 , we prove the existence , uniqueness , and stability of the discrete solution .",
    "the error and convergence analysis are given in section  [ sec : error ] .",
    "we derive error estimates , which are completely explicit in the local step sizes , the local polynomial degrees , and the local regularity of the analytical solution . using suitable refined time - steps ( towards @xmath0 ) , in the @xmath1-norm , convergence of order @xmath35",
    "will be achieved .",
    "section  [ sec : implementation and numerics ] is devoted to present a series of numerical tests which indicate the validity of our theoretical convergence properties and also illustrate that our error bounds are pessimistic . for a strongly graded time mesh , we observe that the error from the time discretization is @xmath36 ( optimal ) , which is better than our theoretical estimate by a factor  @xmath37 .",
    "several authors have proposed a variety of low - order numerical methods for the model problem .",
    "for one dimensional cases , @xcite constructed a box - type scheme based on combining order reduction approach and l@xmath38 discretization was considered .",
    "the authors proved global convergence rates of order @xmath39 , assuming that the solution @xmath17 of is sufficiently regular . an implicit finite difference scheme in time and legendre spectral methods in space",
    "were studied in @xcite .",
    "stability and convergence of order @xmath40 of the method were established , where @xmath9 is the degree of the approximate solution in space and @xmath41 is related to the order of regularity of the solution @xmath17 of , which is typically low .",
    "an extension of this work was considered in @xcite where a time - space spectral method has been proposed and analyzed . for an explicit difference ( first order in time - second order in space ) method , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the stability analysis was carried out by means of a kind of fractional von neumann method .",
    "the authors provided a partial convergence analysis ( truncation error of order @xmath42 ) assuming that @xmath17 is sufficiently regular . an implicit crank ",
    "nicolson had been considered in @xcite and the stability of the proposed scheme was shown .",
    "some numerical experiments were presented to illustrate the convergence of the approximate solutions .",
    "very recently , two finite difference / element approaches were developed in @xcite , in which the time direction was approximated by the fractional linear multistep method and the space direction was approximated by the standard fem of degree @xmath9 .",
    "assuming the solution of is sufficiently smooth , convergence rates of order @xmath43 were proved .    for two ( or three )",
    "dimensional cases , a standard central difference approximation was used for the spatial discretization , and , for the time stepping , two alternating direction implicit ( adi ) schemes based on the @xmath44 approximation and backward euler method were investigated in @xcite . assuming that @xmath17 is smooth",
    ", the authors proved convergence of order @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "a compact finite difference method with operator - splitting techniques was considered in @xcite .",
    "the caputo derivative was evaluated by the @xmath44 approximation , and the second order spatial derivatives were approximated by the fourth order compact ( implicit ) finite differences .",
    "the unconditional stability was analyzed , and by using the energy method , errors of order @xmath47 were achieved assuming that @xmath17 is smooth . in @xcite , for @xmath48 in problem ( that is , homogeneous case ) , the authors studied two spatial semidiscrete piecewise linear approximation schemes : galerkin fem and lumped mass galerkin fem .",
    "optimal error estimates were established including the case of non - smooth initial data . in @xcite ,",
    "the same authors developed two simple fully discrete schemes based on galerkin fems in space and implicit backward differences for the time discretizations .",
    "optimal error estimates with respect to the regularity of the initial data were established .",
    "in contrast , for the numerical solutions of the alternative representation of the fractional subdiffusion problem : @xmath49,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 ( riemann  liouville fractional time derivative of @xmath17 ) , we refer the reader to @xcite . practically , the two representations are different ways of writing the same equation as they are equivalent under reasonable assumptions on the initial data , see @xcite",
    ". however , the numerical methods obtained for each representation are formally different .",
    "to describe our fully discrete dpg - fe method , we introduce a ( possibly nonuniform ) time partition of the interval @xmath51 $ ] given by the points : @xmath52 we set @xmath53 and @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",

    "now , we are ready to define our dpg - fe numerical scheme for problem as follows : find @xmath81 such that , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 in the next section , we will show the well - posedness of our scheme .",
