    "there have been only a few investigations of isotropic hard - wall confinement @xcite .",
    "these have adopted monte carlo simulation augmented with the newton optimization technique .",
    "since newton optimization can not directly minimize the energy of a system under the hard - wall confining potential , the authors @xcite adopted an @xmath0-like confinement to simulate hard - wall confinement in order to study the static and dynamical properties , because an @xmath0-like potential approaches the hard - wall confining potential when the exponent @xmath1 approaches the infinity .    in this paper",

    "but under ellipse hard - wall confinement , the rotational mode with zero frequency at @xmath32 becomes nonzero and some degenerate modes split due to the breaking of cylindrical symmetry . in addition , increasing the eccentricity @xmath6 results in abrupt transitions of the ground - state configurations ( @xmath57 ) , and their eigenmodes change significantly because of the abrupt change of the number of particles at the boundary .       for a cluster @xmath36 . ]",

    "one can find two different mechanisms driving the transition of the ground state configuration as the anisotropy increases .",
    "one is due to anisotropic hard - wall confinement .",
    "the other is the minor ( major ) axis of the ellipse decreases ( increases ) , and consequently the coulomb interaction increases ( decreases ) for @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "when @xmath6 approaches 1 , the former mechanism is dominant and the rotational mode frequency increases ( see dashed line in fig .",
    "6(b ) ) . in addition , this mechanism make high - frequency ( hf ) degenerate mode split into two modes ( see fig.6(a , b ) solid and dotted lines ) .",
    "when @xmath6 decreases ( increases ) further , the latter mechanism becomes more important , and two split hf modes degenerate approximately again and the low - frequency ( lf ) mode saturates gradually . from the eigenvectors at @xmath52 ( see the insets of fig .",
    "6(a ) ) , we find that decreased eccentricity @xmath6 enhances the confinement along the @xmath60 axis , and consequently leads to the increases of frequencies of the vibration modes along the @xmath60 axis . thus those frequencies tend to infinity in the extreme case of @xmath32 . from the 1d coulomb chain potential function ,",
    "we diagonalize the dynamical matrix of the ground - state configuration for an @xmath51 cluster and get that the lowest frequency is 2.0 and the two high frequencies are infinity , which agrees with fig .",
    "in addition , figs .",
    "6(a ) and 6(b ) show that the two split modes cross respectively at @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( notice @xmath63 ) .",
    "we compare the eigenvector of the highest frequency at @xmath53 with that at @xmath54 ( see the insets of fig.6(b ) ) .",
    "one can see that two particles near the major axis move in the same direction at @xmath53 but in the opposite direction at @xmath54 .",
    "this verifies that the cross occurs indeed between @xmath53 and @xmath54 .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss a larger system ( @xmath36 ) to illuminate the effect of the elliptical hard - wall boundary on the spectrum of the system .",
    "7 shows all eigenfrequencies of the @xmath36 cluster as a function of the eccentricity @xmath6 . from this figure",
    ", we see that the frequency spectra exhibit many jumps between @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",
    "this is because the system transits from @xmath34-type to @xmath37-type at @xmath44 ( see the definition of @xmath34-type and @xmath37-type in section ii ) .",
    "the distance between neighboring particles decreases , resulting in an abrupt increase of the eigenfrequency .",
    "in addition , the highest frequency mode diminishes due to the freezing of the radial motion of all particles at the boundary ( see the thirteenth  mode in fig .",
    "it is interesting to note that a small dip appears at @xmath66 which can not be found in the energy figure of the system ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . checking the ground - state configuration around @xmath67 , we find that the system changes from @xmath37-type to the zigzag structure ( see the insets in fig .",
    "next , we explain the effect of the elliptical boundary on vibrational modes in detail in three regions .    when @xmath68 , the system ground state configuration is @xmath34-type , and there are thirteen vibration modes . among these modes ,",

    "( a - l ) is for @xmath52 and ( m - x ) is for @xmath69 ]    when @xmath71 , the system ground state configuration is @xmath37-type . because the number of particles increases by one at the boundary , and the hf modes recompose due to the configuration transition from @xmath34-type to @xmath37-type .",
    "as the eccentricity @xmath6 decreases , the second mode crosses with the third mode ( see fig .",
    "a similar feature was observed experimentally in an anisotropic parabolic confinement @xcite . in the hf part",
    "( see fig .",
    "7(b ) ) , the ninth mode departs from the eighth mode and becomes degenerate with the tenth mode gradually , corresponding to the slow transition of the configuration .    when @xmath72 , the system ground - state configuration is a zigzag structure . from the inset in fig .",
    "7 , we find that the zigzag structure destroys the configuration symmetry , resulting in the splitting of the degenerate modes in the isotropic hard - wall confining potential .",
    "the lowest vibrational mode is no longer the rotation mode , and more crosses between lf modes ( see fig .",
    "7(a ) ) can be found .",
    "the lf eigenvectors at @xmath52 and @xmath69 show clearly the crosses of different modes . from the eigenvectors of the @xmath36 cluster in fig .",
    "8 , we can compare the vibration direction of eigenmodes at @xmath52 with that at @xmath69 and find that all corresponding particles move in the same way among the vibration modes ( a ) and ( o ) , ( b)and ( q ) , ( c ) and ( m ) , ( d ) and ( r ) . the particles with larger vibration amplitudes in the lf modes appear close to the center of the system as @xmath6 decreases .",
    "but the behavior of the hf modes is opposite to that of the lf modes ( see fig . 8) .",
    "the ground - state configuration and dynamical properties of a 2d classical cluster of charged particles in an elliptical hard - wall confining potential are investigated theoretically .",
    "the dependence of the ground - state configuration on the number of particles and the eccentricity of the confining potential are discussed in detail . as the eccentricity @xmath6 decreases , the system exhibits two different kinds of transitions , i.e. , slow and abrupt transitions .",
    "when increasing the system anisotropy , circular shells are deformed into ellipses continuously , the inner shell collapses into a line , and then number of particles in the line decreases gradually .",
    "last , the system exhibits a zigzag structure and forms a 1d coulomb chain when @xmath6 approaches zero .",
    "the boundary anisotropy significantly influence the frequency of the vibration modes . with increasing the anisotropy of the boundary ,",
    "the rotation mode becomes nonzero and degenerate modes split due to the breaking of cylindrical symmetry .",
    "the rotation mode is no longer the lowest vibration mode when the eccentricity @xmath6 approaches zero .      in this appendix",
    ", we present the dynamical matrix of a 2d classical system under the elliptical coordinates . using the coordinate transformation , @xmath73 , where @xmath6 denotes the eccentricity of the elliptical hard - wall boundary",
    ", one can obtain @xmath74 and  @xmath75 .",
    "the equilibrium positions of the particles are denoted by @xmath76    in the harmonic approximation around the equilibrium position , the lagrangian can be expressed as @xmath77 where @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 etc . since @xmath82 linearizing the equation of motion for @xmath83 and @xmath84 and defining @xmath85",
