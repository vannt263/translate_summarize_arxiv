    "the josephson junction system has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally .",

    "an understanding of the influence of thermal fluctuations is crucial in developing applications .",
    "josephson junctions can be characterised by a damping parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the majority of the large body of previous work in the literature has concentrated on junctions in either the underdamped ( @xmath8 ) or overdamped ( @xmath9 limits . in this paper , we focus on the intermediate `` moderately damped '' ( @xmath10 ) limit , where thermal fluctuations lead to interesting physical effects .    for strongly underdamped josephson junctions under the influence of thermal fluctuations ,",
    "the @xmath3 characteristics are hysteretic and the dynamics of switching from the zero - voltage supercurrent state to the finite - voltage resistive phase - slip state are well described by the analysis of fulton and dunkleberger@xcite , with a distribution in switching currents as a result of thermal fluctuations . in contrast , overdamped junctions show non - hysteretic behaviour , with a finite voltage on the supercurrent branch of the @xmath3 characteristic , associated with thermally activated phase diffusion , and thermal fluctuations leading to very much smaller variations in the switching behaviour .",
    "phase diffusion in junctions with hysteretic @xmath3 characteristics has been discussed by kautz and martinis@xcite and is associated with frequency - dependent damping , such that junctions are underdamped at low frequencies , but in the overdamped limit at high frequency .",
    "the temperature dependence of the switching current and the width of its distribution are experimental parameters of much recent interest .",
    "experimental evidence of a crossover in the temperature dependence of the switching current was reported first by franz _ _ et al.__@xcite in experiments on small `` intrinsic '' josephson junctions ( ijjs ) .",
    "they obtained @xmath3 curves characteristic of underdamped junctions below a crossover temperature and @xmath3 curves characteristic of overdamping above that temperature .",
    "more recent experimental papers have reported a crossover in the temperature dependence of the width @xmath1 of the switching current@xcite at a temperature @xmath0 , with positive d@xmath11 below @xmath0 and negative d@xmath11 above @xmath0 .",
    "this was associated with a regime of moderate damping .",
    "the negative d@xmath11 region was associated with retrapping of the phase following escape .",
    "the low - temperature behaviour fits the expectations for underdamped junctions , and the high - temperature behaviour resembles previous observations for overdamped junctions with phase diffusion .",
    "one might simply explain the crossover from underdamped to overdamped behaviour by a temperature - dependent damping @xmath7 and this was indeed the suggestion of franz _ et al .",
    "_ however , it was demonstrated by krasnov _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite that such a crossover should also be expected even for temperature - independent @xmath7 if the junctions are in the moderately damped regime ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "_ derived an approximate quantitative formula with @xmath13 , implying that @xmath0 is a measure of the damping .",
    "several theoretical treatments of the retrapping process have been presented@xcite and the analysis of retrapping was conducted in various ways in the experimental reports of a crossover in @xmath6 . in the analysis of ref .",
    ", retrapping was assumed to be determined purely by energetic considerations : retrapping is certain to occur where it is energetically expected , below a current @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the ( fluctuation - free ) critical current of the josephson junction . for @xmath16",

    "_ we also include the effects of frequency - dependent damping ( see section [ freqdepdt ] ) .",
    "we develop discussion of the important role of multiple escape and retrapping events in the moderate - damping regime and present results of monte carlo simulations showing the variation with experimental parameters of the mean and width of the switching - current distribution.@xcite we consider the crossover between the lower - temperature conventional underdamped regime and the higher - temperature overdamped regime .",
    "although previous studies have considered a single crossover temperature , we show that , in detail , the change occurs in two stages , with a lower - temperature transition from underdamped behaviour to behaviour in the crossover regime , and a higher temperature transition from the crossover regime to the higher - temperature overdamped regime .",
    "we demonstrate a significant change in the shape of the switching current distribution around the crossover and study this quantitatively through the skewness parameter .",
    "the process of return from the resistive state in a hysteretic junction is a much less well - studied phenomenon than that of escape .",
    "here we also consider the process of return from the resistive state to the supercurrent state as the current is ramped down , and the resulting variation in hysteresis around @xmath0 .",
    "we compare our findings with previous reports in the literature .    in our monte carlo simulations",

    "we neglect the temperature dependence of the critical current @xmath15 and @xmath7 in order to emphasize effects due to thermal fluctuations in the junctions .",
    "as a bias current is ramped up , a switch is counted when the junction spends more than half the time in the running state over some time period @xmath25 .. ] throughout this article , we use the term `` escape '' to describe any ( possibly short - lived ) escape from the instantaneous zero - voltage state , and reserve the term `` switch '' to describe an experimentally measured switch to the running state .",
    "similarly , when describing the behaviour as an applied current is ramped _ down _ from the critical current , we reserve the term `` retrapping '' to describe a ( possibly short - lived ) change from the voltage state to the zero - voltage state , and use the term `` return '' to describe an experimentally measured change from the voltage state to the zero - voltage state .",
    "for a resistively shunted josephson junction in the absence of fluctuations , escape from the supercurrent state to a state of finite voltage characterized by the junction resistance occurs when the current bias applied to the junction reaches the junction critical current @xmath15 . at finite temperatures , thermal fluctuations lead to switching at currents below @xmath15 , and there arises experimentally a distribution in possible values of the switching current .",
