    "the discovery of molecules in the interstellar medium about seven decades ago was particularly intriguing since the chemistry governing the formation of molecules in such hostile regions of space was not familiar .",
    "gradually the number of molecules and their cations found in extraterrestrial space increased and it became clear that we in fact live in a  molecular universe \" @xcite .",
    "however , after the first molecule was identified in the interstellar medium , it took six decades before a molecular anion could be discovered in such environment .",
    "this delay was primarily due to the low abundance of anions in space compared to their neutral counterparts and due to the lack of laboratory measurements of high resolution rotational spectra of the anions that could allow their search in space .",
    "the first molecular anion ever observed outside our solar system is c@xmath8h@xmath0 @xcite , which was detected in the envelope of the carbon - rich star irc+10216 .",
    "the identification of this molecular anion was followed by the discovery of several other carbon chain anions , c@xmath9h@xmath0 ( @xmath10 4 , 8) and c@xmath9n@xmath0 ( @xmath10 1 , 3 , 5 ) in various regions of space such as dark clouds , circumstellar envelopes , and also in titan s atmosphere @xcite .",
    "of these anions , c@xmath11n@xmath0 was only tentatively identified .",
    "the role of anions in the synthesis of molecules in the interstellar medium has been investigated by @xcite many years ago , whereas the formation of molecular hydrogen in stars from h@xmath0 had been pointed out by @xcite much earlier .",
    "the recent discovery of anions in extraterrestrial environments has initiated a fresh interest towards the understanding of anion chemistry in exotic environments .",
    "the importance of gas - phase molecular ions in space has been described in detail in a recent review by @xcite .",
    "extraterrestrial molecular anions are believed to be produced predominantly via electron capture processes such as dissociative or radiative attachment @xcite .",
    "the destruction processes are largely due to photodetachment , associative detachment and mutual neutralization reactions . in photon - dominated regions ,",
    "the abundance of molecular anions can be mainly determined by their uv photodetachment . even in the dark clouds where uv photons can not penetrate uv photodetachment",
    "may still contribute to photodestruction of anions because the secondary electrons produced by cosmic rays can excite the molecules to high rydberg states , which emit uv radiation upon decay .",
    "the study of photodetachment processes is also of particular importance in fundamental physics since the extra electron in an anion is bound to the system by means of strong correlated motion of the electrons in the system and the electron - electron correlation plays the most crucial role in such processes .",
    "in addition , no theoretical or experimental values of photodetachment cross sections for cn@xmath0 or c@xmath1n@xmath0 have been reported in the literature despite the fact that there have been a number of studies on these molecular anions @xcite .",
    "since these anions have high electron affinities ( cn@xmath0 : 3.862 @xmath2 0.004 ev @xcite , c@xmath1n@xmath0 : 4.305 @xmath2 0.001 ev @xcite ) their photodetachment requires photons in the ultraviolet range . in the present work , we measured the photodetachment cross sections of cn@xmath0 and c@xmath1n@xmath0 anions at an energy ( 4.66 ev ) near the photodetachment thresholds .",
    "furthermore , we used the measured values as an input to model calculations to investigate the impact of the new cross sections on the predicted abundance of anions in the circumstellar envelope of irc+10216 .",
    "the basic elements of the experimental setup are an ion source , an octupole ion trap , an mcp detector and a laser system .",
    "the ion source consists of a piezoelectric pulsed gas valve with a pair of electrodes ( referred to as ` plasma electrodes ' ) attached at the exit of the valve .",
    "a suitable gas mixture is sent through the gas valve at a certain repetition rate .",
    "the ions are generated in a pulsed dc discharge of the gas jet between the plasma electrodes when a high potential difference is applied between them .",
    "these ions are then extracted towards the ion trap by a wiley - mclaren time - of - flight spectrometer oriented perpendicular to the gas jet from the piezo valve .",
    "deflection plates and lenses are used for guiding and focusing the ions into the ion trap .",
    "the unique octupole ion trap is made of 100 @xmath12 m gold plated molybdenum wires unlike in conventional designs where rods of specific diameter are used as rf electrodes . a short description of this ion trap has been provided by @xcite , where it was used in conjunction with a magneto - optical trap to study reactive collisions of trapped oh@xmath0 anions with trapped rubidium atoms",
    ". a second piezoelectric pulsed gas valve allows for helium buffer gas cooling of the trapped ions .",
    "there are two additional electrodes ( termed as ` shield plates ' ) above and below the trap that enable us to shape the ion density distribution inside the ion trap .",
    "the use of thin wires to construct the trap allows one to probe the trapped ions , for instance with a laser , from the sides .",
    "the laser beam can be focused at various positions inside the trap by means of a two - dimensional translation stage with a lens attached to it .",
    "this configuration is used to map the ion density distribution inside the trap .    in the present experiments ,",
    "cn@xmath0 and c@xmath1n@xmath0 anions were generated by passing argon gas ( at a pressure of about 23 bar ) over acetonitrile vapor and sending the resulting mixture into the source piezo valve which was operated at 14 hz .",
    "the discharge between the plasma electrodes ionized the gas mixture resulting in the production of several anions including cn@xmath0 and c@xmath1n@xmath0 .",
    "the plasma was stabilized by the electrons emitted from a hot filament placed opposite to the pulsed gas valve .",
    "the ions were injected into the wiley - mclaren region , where they were extracted towards the trap with an average kinetic energy of about 240 ev .",
    "the desired ionic species can be stored in the ion trap by appropriate timing of the switchable voltages applied on the entrance and exit electrodes of the ion trap in accordance with the time of flight of the various molecular ions .",
    "the trap was operated at a radiofrequency of 9 mhz with an amplitude of 180 v on top of a dc voltage of about 240 v. the dc voltage of the trap served to reduce the kinetic energy of the ions coming from the source region to about a few ev .",
    "the entrance and exit endcap electrodes of the ion trap were between 10 v and 30 v , the exact value of which did not significantly affect the ion distribution except that the signal strength was slightly modified .",
    "the photodetachment measurements were performed with a pulsed laser beam ( 266 nm , 10 hz ) obtained by frequency quadrupling of the output from a 1064 nm ir laser system with output pulse energy of about 30 mj and with pulse width of 7 ns .",
    "the pulse energy of the laser beam was reduced to a few tens of microjoule and was then sent through a beam splitter .",
    "the transmitted beam was used to measure the fluctuations in the laser energy throughout the experiment and these data were used to correct the measured photodetachment cross section .",
    "the reflected beam was focused into the trap using the lens attached on the translation stage .",
    "the pulse energy of the beam fired into the trap was as low as 25 @xmath12j so as to ensure that there was only single photon absorption and that the wires constituting the trap were not damaged when the laser beam struck them .",
    "the measurement procedure was very similar to the one described previously @xcite except that in the present experiments the laser beam was sent into the ion trap perpendicular to its symmetry axis . briefly",
    ", the ions can be stored in the trap for a few hundred seconds ( @xmath13 lifetime , determined from the exponential decay of the ions stored in the trap ) . in the first part of the experiment ,",
    "the background decay rate was determined by measuring the amount of ions left in the trap after different storage times . in the second part",
    ", the rates of decay were measured with the uv laser pointing at different positions inside the trap .",
    "the photodetachment decay rates when plotted as a function of the positions form a tomography image which reflects the ion density distribution inside the trap .",
    "the integral of the rate map is proportional to the photodetachment cross section as detailed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the photodetachment cross section , @xmath14 , is given by the expression @xcite : @xmath15\\ dx\\ dy},\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the position dependent decay rate due to photodetachment , @xmath17 is the background decay rate ( decay rate measured without laser ) and @xmath18 is the photon flux .",
    "the photodetachment cross sections measured for cn@xmath0 and c@xmath1n@xmath0 anions in the present experiments , together with those obtained previously @xcite for the carbon chain anions c@xmath19h@xmath0 , c@xmath20h@xmath0 and c@xmath8h@xmath0 , were used as input for model calculations of the circumstellar envelope of irc+10216 .",
    "the photodetachment cross sections of cn@xmath0 and c@xmath1n@xmath0 were fitted to the expression used in previous model calculations @xcite : @xmath21 in which @xmath22 is the cross section , @xmath23 the cross section at infinite photon energy , @xmath24 the photodetachment threshold energy and @xmath25 the photon energy . since our cross section measurements have been carried out only at a wavelength of 266 nm ( at which a sufficiently intense uv beam was available from our laser systems ) only two points exist for the fit of the photon energy / cross section curve for each of the nitrile anions , the cross section at threshold energy ( where @xmath26 ) and the one measured at 266 nm . of course , there exists the possibility of strong resonances , especially at photon energies only slightly above the threshold , which can not be ruled out in the absence of complementary experimental data on photodetachment cross sections of these anions . for a more accurate treatment of the model , one would require experimental cross sections at higher photon energies necessitating radiation from sources such as synchrotrons or free electron lasers ( fels ) . regarding the threshold energy ( @xmath24 ) of cn@xmath0 , the value obtained by @xcite who employed a pulsed fixed - frequency negative ion photoelectron spectrometer ( 3.862 @xmath2 0.004 ev ) was used for the fit . in the case of c@xmath1n@xmath0 the result from @xcite measured using slow electron velocity - map imaging ( 4.305 @xmath2 0.001 ev ) and field - free time - of - flight was applied . for the photodetachment",
    "cross sections of the hydrocarbon anions the fitted values from @xcite were used .",
    "the chemical models are based on the assumption of a uniform mass - loss rate for the circumstellar envelope of irc+10216 described by @xcite together with a second model , described by @xcite , in which density - enhanced shells are included . with density - enhanced shells of gas and dust , a more realistic modelling of the circumstellar envelope",
    "is achieved by introducing a set of density enhancements with the physical parameters of the envelope based on the dust - shell observation by @xcite . for modelling ,",
    "the conditions expected for the well - studied circumstellar envelope of irc+10216 were applied .",
    "consequently , a spherically symmetric outflow velocity from the central star of 1.45 @xmath5 10@xmath27 cm s@xmath28 and a mass loss of 1.5 @xmath5 10@xmath29 solar masses per year were assumed for the envelope @xcite .",
    "the adopted temperature profile is based on a fit to the gas kinetic temperature profile of @xcite , with a minimum temperature of 10 k fixed in the outer region of the envelope and is the same as used by @xcite .",
    "the initial chemical abundances of parent molecules relative to that of h@xmath19 used in the model are listed in table [ t : abund ] .",
    "these species are formed in the inner envelope close to the star at high density and temperature and blown outwards in a spherically symmetric outflow @xcite .",
    "the calculations begin at an inner radius of @xmath30 cm where photons from the external , interstellar radiation field begin to destroy parent species creating reactive radicals and ions and initiating the synthesis of anions and other species . the number density @xmath31 declines with the radius as @xmath32 . in the second set of calculations , in addition to the @xmath32 dependence of the number density , a series of step - like density enhancements of the form @xmath33 is introduced",
    "the parameter @xmath34 is set to 5 for all shells in the model .",
    "according to dust shell parameters deduced from scattered light observations by @xcite , we assume that each shell has a thickness of 2 arcsec and the spacing between the shells is 12 arcsec .",
    "this distance corresponds to roughly 530 years between the peaks of enhanced mass loss ( see @xcite for details . ) .",
    ".abundances of parent species used in the model . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it can be seen that the input of the experimental cross sections somewhat reduces the column densities and thus slightly deteriorates the agreement between the modelled and observed cross sections .",
    "also , the c@xmath1n@xmath0/c@xmath1n ratio predicted by the model ( @xmath35 ) now lies below the observed value ( @xmath36 ) , whereas previous models tended to overestimate it ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the inclusion of high - density shells does increase the anion column densities by around 1020% .",
    "however , they remain smaller , but within the same order of magnitude , than those observed .    the predicted densities",
    "not only depend strongly on the rates of photodetachment but also on the efficiency of the formation reactions , such as radiative attachment , radical - ion and dissociative attachment reactions .",
    "regarding the generation of the two cyano anions the model predicts that reactions of n radicals with c@xmath37 ions , e.g. , @xmath38 dominate as formation pathways in the outer and middle parts of the envelope ( r @xmath39 cm ) for both cn@xmath0 and c@xmath1n@xmath0 .",
    "these processes might be partly responsible for the extraordinarily high anion to neutral abundance ratio for c@xmath1n@xmath0 @xcite . in the innermost regions ( r @xmath40 cm ) ,",
    "formation of cn@xmath0 proceeds via reaction of h@xmath0 with hcn : @xmath41 the importance of the latter process is due to the formation of h@xmath0 through cosmic ray induced ion pair formation in the inner shells of the envelope @xcite . at these small radii , radiative attachment of c@xmath1n and dissociative attachment of hnc@xmath1 are predominant formation routes of c@xmath1n@xmath0 :    @xmath42    whereas the reactions of n atoms with c@xmath9 chain anions have been characterized in a selected ion flow tube experiment @xcite , there are , as yet , no laboratory studies on the formation of the cyanide anion from h@xmath0 and hcn .",
    "there are also uncertainties in the destruction processes . at a distance from the central star of around 6 @xmath43 cm , where the abundance of the cn@xmath0 and the c@xmath1n@xmath0 anions peaks , photodetachment clearly is the most important degradation mechanism of the two anions and accounts for 45 % of the breakdown of c@xmath1n@xmath0 and 35 % for cn@xmath0 . in the case of cn@xmath0 ,",
    "other decay processes are mutual neutralization with c@xmath44 ( 30 % ) and si@xmath44 ( 7 % ) as well as associative detachment with h ( 15 % ) .",
    "minor loss processes of c@xmath1n@xmath0 are mutual neutralization with c@xmath44 ( 25 % ) and si@xmath44 ( 6 % ) and associative detachment with h ( 11 % ) . in the outer regions of the cloud ( r @xmath45 cm )",
    "mutual neutralization with c@xmath44 actually becomes predominant for both c@xmath1n@xmath0 ( accounting for 72 % of the loss at a distance of @xmath46 cm from the star ) and cn@xmath0 ( 79 % at the same radius ) .",
    "this behavior is most likely due to the increase of c@xmath44 abundance towards the edge of the cloud ( the peak density of this species there is around 5.4 @xmath5 10@xmath47 @xmath48 with an abundance ratio c@xmath44/h@xmath19 of @xmath49 at a radius of @xmath50 cm ) , which is caused by photoionization of c through the interstellar radiation field . in the inner regions of the circumstellar envelope ( r @xmath51 cm ) mutual neutralization with mg@xmath44",
    "is predicted to be the main degradation process .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the mg@xmath44 number density is fairly constant throughout the envelope ( ranging between @xmath52 @xmath48 and @xmath53 @xmath48 ) , whereas the c@xmath44 abundance is as low as @xmath54 @xmath48 at a radius of @xmath55 cm .",
    "consequently , the abundance ratio of c@xmath44 to h@xmath19 increases from @xmath56 at a radius of @xmath57 cm to @xmath58 at a radius of @xmath59 cm , whereas the one of mg@xmath44 to h@xmath19 spans only 5 orders of magnitude , rising from @xmath60 at a radius of @xmath57 cm to @xmath61 at a radius of @xmath59 cm .",
    "but even at the outermost and the innermost distances photodetachment significantly contributes to the destruction of cn@xmath0 and c@xmath1n@xmath0 .",
    "the peak abundances of the two cyano anions investigated in this study lie at the radii @xmath62 cm and @xmath63 cm for cn@xmath0 and c@xmath1n@xmath0 , respectively , and the maxima of the fractional abundances at @xmath64 cm for cn@xmath0 and @xmath65 cm for c@xmath1n@xmath0 .",
    "this implies that the cn@xmath0 peak radius predicted by the model is somewhat larger than the one concluded from observations ( @xmath55 cm ) , but slightly lower than the one predicted by model calculations of @xcite ( @xmath66 cm ) . from the present data",
    "it can be concluded that photodetachment is a very crucial process in the degradation of anions throughout the envelope .",
    "however , one has to consider the uncertainties regarding the rate constants of the formation and destruction mechanisms of the two anions .",
    "the relative importance of photodetachment depends on the rate constants of the competing processes , namely the mutual neutralization processes of the cyano anions with c@xmath44 and other metallic ions . @xcite",
    "estimated the rate constant of the reaction of c@xmath1n@xmath0 with c@xmath44 based on earlier flowing afterglow langmuir probe measurements @xcite of other ions to follow the expression : @xmath67 to the best of our knowledge , no experimental data on the reaction rate constants of these processes have so far been obtained .",
    "the new desiree double storage ring at stockholm university will amend this shortcoming @xcite .    in agreement with other model calculations , the abundances of the anions peak at larger radii than the corresponding neutrals @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of shells with enhanced density similar to the model of @xcite increases the column densities of the anions by about 20% and improves the agreement with observed column densities , predominantly through reducing the rates of photodetachment through the increased dust extinction that they provide .",
    "the absolute photodetachment cross sections of two molecular anions of astrophysical importance , cn@xmath0 and c@xmath1n@xmath0 , were measured at the ultraviolet wavelength of 266 nm .",
    "the measured cross sections are relatively high and might indicate the possibility of strong resonances near the photodetachment threshold .",
    "high cross sections imply that the abundance of these molecular anions can be crucially dependent on their destruction by photodetachment especially in photon - dominated regions .",
    "the presented model calculations , carried out to investigate molecular anions in the circumstellar envelope of irc+10216 , predict the relative importance of the various mechanisms of production and destruction of cyano anions in different regions of the envelope .",
    "it was found that in regions where these molecular anions have their peak abundance , photodetachment serves as the most important destruction mechanism .",
    "the calculations also predict that photodetachment significantly contributes to the destruction of these anions throughout the circumstellar envelope .",
    "thus photodetachment plays a fundamental role in the degradation of anions in circumstellar envelopes .",
    "however , its exact significance can only be determined if more data on other competing pathways are available .",
    "future experimental investigations on these processes are therefore vital for our understanding of the anion chemistry of circumstellar envelopes .",
