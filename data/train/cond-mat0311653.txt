    "bose - einstein condensates provide an important quantum system where one can observe many important phenomena such as superfluid - mott insulator transition @xcite and vortices @xcite .",
    "recent advances in experimental techniques @xcite have stimulated interest in one - dimensional ( 1d ) bose gases .",
    "the 1d case leads to some interesting physics which does not occur in higher dimensions .",
    "the experimental feasibility of realizing a tightly confined ( 1d ) trapped gas has been investigated theoretically using bessel light beams @xcite .",
    "it is well known that a true bec can not occur at any finite temperature in an interacting homogeneous bose gas in 1d @xcite , due to long wavelength fluctuations ; nor can it occur in the limit of zero temperature @xcite , due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "however , the presence of a trapping potential changes the density of states at low energies , and in the weakly - interacting limit a bec may be formed @xcite .",
    "recently petrov @xmath1 discussed three different regimes of quantum degeneracy which can occur in a condensate confined in 1d trap @xcite : bec , quasi - condensate , and tonks - girardeau gas .",
    "in the weakly interacting limit a bec exists , but as the interaction becomes stronger the mean field energy becomes important .",
    "when this energy becomes of the order of the energy level spacing of the trap , fluctuations again become significant . in this regime ,",
    "the system forms a quasi - condensate , with local phase coherence , rather than the global coherence associated with a true condensate .",
    "the quasi - condensate density has the same smooth profile as a true condensate but the phase fluctuates in space and time .",
    "phase fluctuations of the condensate are caused mainly by low energy collective excitations @xcite .",
    "quasi - condensates in 3d have been observed experimentally in equilibrium @xcite and non - equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the fact that the velocity of a true condensate @xmath2 ( with @xmath3 the phase of the condensate ) leads to the important constraint namely irrotationality @xmath4 . on the other hand , the normal component which is substantially higher in a quasi - condensate as compared to a true condensate",
    "is not constrained by the condition of irrotationality .",
    "hence we take advantage of this property of the quasi - condensate and propose in this work the use of a 2d optical rotator to produce a rotational bosonic current ( @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the velocity of the normal component ) in a quasi condensate and study the conditions under which this current is stable .",
    "we show that using this scheme , it is possible to distinguish between quasi - condensate and true condensate .",
    "it is to be noted that such a current is not vortex .",
    "such a kind of a rotator has been proposed for cold atoms based on the principle of transfer of angular momentum of the photons to the atoms @xcite using a tem@xmath8 circularly polarized laguerre - gaussian beam .",
    "it has been experimentally demonstrated that a blue - detuned hollow bessel laser beam formed by an axicon can be successfully used to trap laser cooled metastable xenon atoms @xcite .",
    "experimentally , cesium atoms have been trapped in an all blue - detuned stack of optical rings by interference of a standard gaussian beam with a counter - propagating hollow beam generated by a pair of axicon @xcite .",
    "we propose the use of such an experimental scheme with a tem@xmath8 beam in order to realize the 2d optical rotator .",
    "we will examine the motion of a condensate within an optical toroidal ring trap as experimentally realized in ref .",
    "@xcite and previously theoretically analyzed by wright et al .",
    "@xcite the potential created by the optical laser may be written as    @xmath9    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the location of the potential minima and also the mean radius of the torus .",
    "@xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the oscillation frequency along the @xmath14(@xmath15 ) direction . because we suppose the plane of the ring perpendicular to the direction of gravity ( @xmath14 direction in our system ) , the atomic energies are not effected by gravity .",
    "the optical torus described by the potential of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is represented in fig .",
    "[ torus ] .",
    "the atomic motion within the toroidal trap includes also a rotational energy along the center of the torus , described by the following rotational hamiltonian :    @xmath16    where the moment of inertia for an atom with mass @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath19 is the rotational quantum number , then the rotational hamiltonian defines an energy spectrum whose energy spacing is linked to the rotation frequency @xmath20 for @xmath21 as    @xmath22    note that the rotational frequency @xmath20 depends only on the radius of the ring @xmath23 . in the radial direction ,",
    "the ring radius is approximately the radius of the laser beam , which therefore should be chosen as small as possible for a tight confinement . extending the experimental parameters of @xcite to rb atoms , with a beam radius of about 50 @xmath24 m , potential height of 10 @xmath25 and @xmath26 khz",
    ", one can find @xmath27 khz , @xmath28 khz and @xmath29 hz ( for @xmath30 transition ) .",
    "moreover we will suppose , as in ref .",
    "@xcite that using for the laser field an high order circularly polarized laguerre - gaussian mode , an orbital angular momentum is transfered by the laser field to the atoms .",
    "therefore the rotational motion of the condensate atoms at the frequency @xmath20 can be excited by the laser field .",
    "let us now systematically investigate the collective modes of a true condensate and that of a quasi - condensate ( in the presence of a rotational velocity field ) in an optical torus .",
    "for a true condensate the velocity is the gradient of a scalar , the velocity field is thus irrotational , unless the phase of the order parameter has a singularity ( vortex ) .",
    "a simple description of the collective oscillations is provided by the irrotational hydrodynamics equations of superfluids    @xmath31=0 \\label{eq5}\\ ] ]    @xmath32=0 \\label{eq6}\\ ] ]    where @xmath33 is the superfluid spatial density , @xmath34 is the superfluid velocity field in the laboratory frame and @xmath17 is the mass of the atom .",
    "the parameter @xmath35 characterizes the strength of the inter - atomic interactions and is related to the @xmath36-wave scattering length @xmath37 for a 3d gas by @xmath38 .",
    "these equations are valid in the thomas - fermi limit , where the so - called quantum pressure term is neglected .",
    "the density can be written as @xmath39 , and @xmath40 where @xmath41(@xmath42 ) is the equilibrium density ( velocity ) and @xmath43(@xmath44 ) is a small perturbation of the density ( velocity ) from its equilibrium value .",
    "the collective oscillations can be derived by looking for a general time - dependent solutions of the form ( see @xcite )    @xmath45    @xmath46    where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are time dependents parameters to be determined . in the linear limit",
    ", one can look for solutions varying in time like @xmath49 .",
    "linearizing eqs .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) and inserting @xmath43 and @xmath50 and solving for the modes @xmath51 for @xmath52 , one finds    @xmath53    these modes describe the coupling between the center of mass motion along the radial and axial directions .",
    "[ roots ] displays these modes as a function of the radial frequency which are seen to be stable .",
    "the frequencies are normalized with respect to the @xmath12 axial frequency .",
    "we now allow for the condition of tight confinement , i.e. the particles are constrained to move only along the path @xmath54 . in the tight confinement regime , at sufficiently low temperatures the radial motion of particles ( the center of mass modes along @xmath55 and the @xmath56 direction ) is essentially frozen if the radial frequency @xmath13 is much more than the mean - field interaction energy .",
    "note that the tight confinement regime is not the 1d regime as discussed in @xcite . in our system",
    ", we still have the velocity component in both @xmath55 and @xmath56 directions .",
    "we prefer to call it as the pseudo 1d regime . proceeding as before",
    ", we find in the tight confinement regime the two modes corresponding to center of mass motion along the @xmath14 direction and the scissoring modes @xmath57(@xmath58 ) as @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively .",
    "these low energy excitations frequencies are exactly the lowest mode of excitation found numerically in @xcite which confirms the accuracy of the hydrodynamic approach .",
    "the special properties of superfluids are a consequence of their motions being constraint by the fact that the velocity ( @xmath61 ) of the condensate is proportional to the gradient of the phase ( @xmath3 ) of the wave function that is @xmath2 .",
    "we see directly from this definition that @xmath61 satisfies two important constraints , namely the condition of irrotationality @xmath4 and the onsager - feynman quantization condition @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "obviously , in a simply connected geometry with condensate wave function finite everywhere , the condition of irrotationality implies the onsager - feynman quantization condition with @xmath64 , but for more general cases involving vortices or in a torus ( multiply connected geometry ) , @xmath65 can be non zero .    in stable or metastable equilibrium",
    "the total bosonic current will have contribution from both the normal as well as the superfluid component ( landau s two fluid hypothesis ) .",
    "now if by some mechanism , the condensate in the torus with mean radius @xmath23 is made to rotate with an angular velocity @xmath20 , then the linear velocity of the normal component will be simply @xmath66 while the linear velocity of the superfluid component will be constrained by the quantization condition and in general can not be equal to @xmath66 .",
    "in fact , a simple statistical mechanical argument shows that the lowest free energy is obtained when @xmath65 takes the value closest to @xmath67 where @xmath68 . for @xmath69",
    ", @xmath65 is equal to zero and consequently the superfluid component no longer contributes to the circulating current . at larger values of @xmath20 ( @xmath70 )",
    ", the superfluid will contribute to the total angular momentum an amount @xmath71 .",
    "an inspection of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) for @xmath30 transition together with the definition of @xmath72 , we find that @xmath73 irrespective of the radius of the 2d optical rotator . consequently , in a true condensate , where the normal component is extremely low , the total bosonic current is almost zero for @xmath69 .",
    "based on the above discussion , we argue that in a quasi - condensate , where the normal component is substantially higher than a true condensate , for @xmath69 , the normal component will contribute significantly to the bosonic current , which one could detect . thus using this proposal , it could be possible to distinguish between a quasi - condensate and a true one .",
    "we propose that the theoretical scheme introduced in @xcite may be used to transfer orbital angular momentum of the photon to a cloud of ultra - cold atoms in a quasi - condensate state . a velocity field created in such",
    "a manner is rotational .",
    "this velocity field can be visualized by introducing a vector potential @xmath74 in the quasi - condensate total velocity @xmath6    @xmath75 \\label{eq10}\\ ] ]    where the vector potential @xmath74 is associated with the rotational component of the velocity    @xmath76    with @xmath77 .",

    "the angular velocity of the sample is easily adjusted by the mean ring radius @xmath23 ( see eq .",

    "the continuity equation leads to the following expression for @xmath88    @xmath89    thus we see from eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) that the irrotational component of the velocity field which comes into picture as a result of the perturbation destroys the bosonic current with uniform angular velocity @xmath20 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) we infer that for such a uniform current to exist , we must have @xmath90 .",
    "the conservation of circular symmetry guarantees a uniform current in the quasi - condensate .",
    "in the presence of a weak , static , asymmetric perturbation , angular momentum is not conserved . in a rotating quasi - condensate ,",
    "scattering of particles against such an asymmetric perturbation will ultimately bring the fluid to rest .",
    "having found that circular symmetry as a necessary criterion for a uniform current to exist , we now proceed to calculate the collective modes in the non - equilibrium state .",
    "collective modes in the presence of a rotational velocity field for a trap with circular symmetry can be derived as in section [ collective modes of a true condensate in an optical torus ] by looking for time - dependant solutions for @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",

    "( [ eq18 ] ) ( dashed line in fig . [ rootsbis ] ) is always positive and constant .",
    "this non dependence on @xmath20 is a consequence of the absence of excitations in the @xmath96 plane due to tight confinement .",
    "we find that for a non - zero value of @xmath20 , one of the scissoring modes in the @xmath57(@xmath58 ) planes of eq .",
    "( [ eq19 ] ) ( lower curve in fig .",
    "[ rootsbis ] ) is always negative .",
    "this signals energetic instability because the magnitude of the smallest root is always equal to the angular velocity @xmath20 .",
    "this is equivalent to the landau criterion of super - fluid stability @xcite with respect to proliferation of elementary excitations i.e. the bosonic current becomes unstable when the frequency of the lowest energy excitation becomes equal or more than the angular velocity .",
    "a similar result is found for a bose gas in a toroidal container using bogoliugov approximation @xcite .",
    "thus to have an energetically stable current we need to freeze the motion in @xmath57 and @xmath58 planes .",
    "this means that we restrict the modes of the elementary excitations to only the @xmath14 direction whose frequency is given by eq .",

    "let us now look into the possible experimental realization of such a pseudo quasi - condensate in our proposed scheme .",
    "the mean field interaction frequency @xmath97 for @xmath98 and @xmath99 nm ( in the case of rb ) is found to be @xmath100 hz much less than the radial trap frequency ( @xmath101 hz , see section [ description of the optical torus ] ) which implies that we are indeed in the pseudo 1d regime . following @xcite , one can introduce a dimensionless quantity @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the amplitude of axial zero point oscillations .",
    "the regime of a weakly interacting gas corresponds to @xmath104 . in this regime ,",
    "the condensate is in the thomas - fermi regime if the number of particles @xmath105 .",

    "working between these two temperature limit and having @xmath113 , one can thus be in the pseudo 1d quasi - condensate regime .",
    "this scheme allows us to distinguish between a quasi - condensate and a true condensate by simply measuring the rotational spectrum of the sample .",
    "the rotational spectrum of the sample can be measured by using two consecutive bragg pulses probing the momentum distribution in a trapped bose gas at low temperature @xcite .",
    "a stimulated raman transition involves absorption of a photon from one beam followed by stimulated emission into the other ; if the system is in a quasi - condensate regime then this process will transfer an orbital angular momentum off to the atom , but no linear momentum in the axial or radial directions .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed the use of a new type of optical toroidal trap to induce a uniform rotational bosonic current ( which is not a vortex ) in a quasi - condensate .",
    "the principle of producing such a current of rotational is based on the transfer of angular momentum of the photon to the atoms of the normal component .",
    "the angular velocity induced by the proposed 2d optical rotator is exactly half the critical angular velocity required by the superfluid component to contribute to the total bosonic current .",
    "hence , the given optical rotator is unable to transfer any angular momentum to the atoms in the superfluid component .",
    "we are thus able to distinguish between a quasi - condensate and a true condensate by measuring the rotational spectrum of the sample by two - photon bragg spectroscopy .",
    "our analysis indicates that such a rotational current is uniform when the circular symmetry of the ring trap is conserved and energetically stable when the elementary excitations are completely frozen in the transverse direction ( @xmath96 plane ) .",
