    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are associated with the accretion of gas onto supermassive black holes residing in the centres of galaxies .",
    "the accretion - disk , feeding the black hole , generates continuum photons that photoionize and excite a gaseous region ( known as the broad - line region ) located just beyond the disk , light - days to light - weeks away from the black hole .",
    "this region produces the characteristic broad emission lines with velocity widths of @xmath62000kms@xmath7 ( induced by the gravity of the black hole ) observed in the optical - uv spectra of a class of agns ( the so - called ` type 1 agns ' ) .",
    "the photoionization of lower - velocity gas at distances of hundreds of parsecs by the accretion - disk photons produces narrower emission lines ( @xmath81000kms@xmath7 ) . to explain the absence of broad emission lines in the spectra of a fraction of agns ( known as ` type2 agns ' ) , agn structural models @xcite posit that the accretion disk and broad - line region are surrounded by a dusty torus that obscures our view of these central regions in objects where the accretion disk is viewed ( near ) edge on .",
    "only the narrow - line emission originating from more extended regions not obscured by the torus can be observed in these type2 agns .",
    "the occurrence of agn activity in a galaxy is contingent upon the availability of gas to fuel the black hole .",
    "however , the mechanisms by which cold gas is transported from the galaxy disk at kpc scales to hundreds of pc scales , and further down into the inner few parsecs to sustain or trigger agn activity , remain poorly understood to this day ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the interplay between gas inflows and outflows on these scales , as well as the presence ( or absence ) of dynamical barriers , determine the efficiencies at which the central black hole is fueled .",
    "these processes also influence the duty cycles of agns , i.e. , the typical timescales during which agns are turned on ( and off ) .",
    "integral field unit ( ifu ) observations of nearby agns have revealed inflows of ionized gas down to 10pc scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the estimated inflow rates of the ionized gas in these observations are much lower than the observed black hole accretion rates .",
    "this is because the gas is predominantly molecular near the centre of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such that ionized gas becomes a poor tracer of inflowing gas in the centre .",
    "the nuclei of galaxies ( nuga ) program @xcite has observed the distribution of cold molecular gas ( as traced by the presence of carbon monoxide , co ) in 16 seyfert and low - ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ) galaxies at cosmic distances of 4mpc to 43mpc with the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) , achieving a spatial resolution of about 100pc .",
    "however , evidence for inflowing gas has been found only in one third of the nuga galaxies on these scales @xcite .",
    "the non - detection of direct evidence of fueling in the other two thirds of the nuga galaxies may be due to outflowing gas driven by nuclear star formation , agn winds and/or agn jets that temporarily disrupt the nuclear fueling .",
    "in such a scenario , agns will undergo successive periods of fueling and starvation .",
    "more recent observations with the atacama large millimetre / submilllimetre array ( alma ) are probing the gas fueling mechanisms of agns at even smaller spatial scales , thereby mapping the molecular interstellar medium at 25pc to 100pc scales in local agn host galaxies , including ngc1433 @xcite , ngc1566 @xcite and ngc1068 @xcite .",
    "these studies reveal gas inflows and outflows occuring simultaneously on scales of tens of pc . at scales smaller than 10pc ,",
    "the physical connections and coupling of energetics between the different gas components , including the accretion disk gas , the broad - line emitting gas , the narrow - line emitting gas and the cold molecular gas , are still unknown .    between the years 2006 and 2012 , the broad h@xmath9 emission line in the optical spectrum of the agn in mrk590 , a seyfert galaxy , has disappeared .",
    "examination of 40 years of published data on mrk590 reveal an increase in the optical - uv continuum , broad - line and narrow - line fluxes from the 1970s to the early 1990s ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein for a complete account ) .",
    "since then , the strengths of the broad emission lines ( including h@xmath10 and civ ) have steadily decreased to their present weak states . in the period between the early 1990s to the present ,",
    "the x - ray continuum flux has also weakened , while the nuclear optical - uv continuum emission has faded to the point where the observed continuum can be fully accounted for by stellar population models of the host galaxy @xcite . while still clearly visible , the narrow @xmath11\\ , \\lambda 5007 $ ] line has also decreased in flux by a factor of @xmath12 .",
    "the weakening of the @xmath11 $ ] line appears to be delayed by up to ten years relative to that of the optical - uv continuum and broad h@xmath9 line , consistent with the larger spatial extent of the narrow - line region .",

    "also shown are the model component of the agn power - law continuum ( black dash - dotted curve ) and the far - ir modified black body component ( black dotted curve ; details are in appendix  [ appendix ] ) .",
    "the alternate model fit to the ir sed plus the sma flux density ( alma data omitted ; section  [ smacont ] ) is shown as the red dashed curve.[sedfit ] ]    the dust temperature of the far - ir component is estimated from the model sed to be 53k , within the typical @xmath1440k to 70k range of temperatures observed for the ` cold ' dust components in other local seyferts in the cfa sample @xcite .",
    "although these cool dust temperatures are often associated with star forming regions and starburst galaxies , we argue that the far - ir and 343ghz continuum emission is agn dominated .",
    "this is based on the fact that the total far - ir luminosity derived from the model sed , @xmath15 , yields @xmath16 , four orders of magnitude higher than sfr(h@xmath17 ) ( table  [ resultssummary ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we detect only the continuum emission in the centre with no stellar - heated dust continuum emission tracing the @xmath0co(32 ) gas ring",
    ".    furthermore , there are hints that the mid - ir and far - ir continuum fluxes may exhibit variability with trends consistent with that observed in the optical - uv line and continuum emission ( described in appendix  [ appendix ] )",
    ". if the thermal dust emission is predominantly agn heated , the variability of the mid - to - far - ir continuum fluxes ( if real ) can be caused by the heating and cooling of the dust surrounding the accretion disk and broad - line region ( e.g. , from the dusty  torus  , * ? ? ?",
    "this variability may even extend into the rayleigh - jeans regime at mm wavelengths .",
    "continued monitoring of the ( sub-)mm , far - ir and mid - ir continuum fluxes will be crucial to confirm this short - timescale variability . detecting variability on timescales of years to decades will also confirm a small spatial extent of the far - ir emitting regions .",
    "if the flux variations follow trends similar to the variability of the agn observed at other wavelengths ( e.g. , broad emission line , optical - uv and x - ray fluxes ) , it provides further evidence that the mm and far - ir continuum emission is dominated by the agn rather than stellar components at these spatial scales .",
    "the model sed yields a dust mass of @xmath18 . adopting a dust to total gas mass ratio of @xmath19 and assuming solar metallicities",
    "@xcite , we infer a total gas mass ( both atomic and molecular ) of @xmath20 . this is more than an order of magnitude higher than the upper limits of @xmath21 or @xmath22 estimated in section  [ gasmass ] , depending on the conversion factor , @xmath23 , used .",
    "if the actual h@xmath17 to hi gas mass ratio in the central 150pc is equivalent to 0.48 as measured by single - dish observations @xcite , we can explain the discrepancy to within the measurement and co conversion uncertainties . with the hi gas mass",
    "twice the value of @xmath24 , the total hi and h@xmath17 gas mass can be as high as @xmath25 , consistent with the value of @xmath26 derived from the dust mass .",
    "however , since the gas is expected to be predominantly molecular in the central regions ( section  [ sfr ] ) , the adopted h@xmath17 to hi gas mass ratio is unrealistic . while the value of @xmath26 derived from @xmath27 is consistent with the higher end of @xmath24 constraints determined from the @xmath0co(32 ) emission , another explanation for the possible overestimation of the gas mass from the continuum emission is that the total alma continuum flux may be biased by other contributing sources of emission , e.g. , synchrotron emission from the agn jet or free - free emission .",
    "we now examine if other sources of continuum emission besides dust , namely synchrotron and/or free - free emission , contribute significantly to the total 344ghz continuum flux density measured by alma . from the 8.4ghz and 344ghz integrated flux densities , each obtained at comparable angular resolutions of @xmath28 , we estimate the spectral index to be @xmath29 .",
    "this is comparable to the spectral index of @xmath30 obtained by @xcite from radio continuum observations .",
    "the radio spectral index , @xmath31 , could arise from synchrotron emission that is self - absorbed at lower frequencies , or a combination of synchrotron ( typically @xmath32 ) and free - free emission ( typically @xmath33 ) .",
    "these emission components could extend into the mm wavelength regime and contribute to a fraction of the alma continuum flux .",
    "however , @xcite also measured a slightly steeper spectral index from the 5ghz and 20ghz flux density , @xmath34 .",
    "this could mean that the radio emission is self - absorbed synchrotron emission that is beginning to steepen at around 20ghz . if the spectral index continues to steepen further at frequencies above 20ghz",
    ", it would imply that free - free emission and/or synchrotron emission are not the sole contributors to the 344ghz continuum emission .",
    "we have secured more observing time with the jansky very large array and alma in cycle 3 to better characterize the continuum spectral shapes at ( sub-)mm to radio wavelengths , and better determine the source of this continuum emission .",
    "the larger synthesized beam of the sma measures additional extended , low surface brightness continuum emission from the inner gas ring , resulting in a higher flux density at 219ghz compared to the 344ghz alma continuum flux ( figure  [ sedfit ] ) .",
    "this emission may have been resolved out or missed due to the low surface brightness sensitivity of the alma images .",
    "we carry out the sed model - fitting procedure as described in section  [ thermaldust ] and appendix  [ appendix ] again , this time using the 219ghz sma flux density and excluding the alma measurement .",
    "the model fit ( red dashed line in figure  [ sedfit ] ) gives a colder dust temperature of 22k and a higher dust mass of @xmath35 ( relative to the alma - based estimate of the dust mass in section  [ thermaldust ] ) , consistent with the scenario where the sma continuum flux contains contributions from colder , stellar - heated dust emission . from the dust mass",
    ", we estimate a total gas mass of @xmath36 , again assuming a dust to gas mass ratio of @xmath19 and solar metallicities @xcite .",
    "this gas mass is consistent with the molecular gas mass of @xmath37 to @xmath38 ( depending on @xmath23 ) estimated for the inner 4@xmath39 of mrk590 from the co data .",
    "however , the sed - inferred @xmath40 of @xmath41 still overestimates the sfr , indicating that there is still a significant agn contribution to the total 219ghz flux . from the @xmath40",
    ", we obtain a sfr estimate of @xmath42 , at least an order of magnitude higher than the limit of @xmath43 to @xmath44 ( depending on @xmath23 ) derived for the inner 4@xmath39 in section  [ sfrco ] .",
    "these additional contributions could originate from agn - heated dust in the central 150pc , or from synchrotron and free - free emission arising from both the agn and the star - forming regions in the gas ring itself .",
    "changing - look agns demonstrate that it is important to account for a variable agn accretion rate and evolution when unifying the wide range of observed agn characteristics at all wavelengths .",
    "some studies attempt to construct a coherent evolutionary sequence between type1 agns ( displaying broad emission lines in the spectra ) and type2 agns ( with no broad emission lines ) in the context of galaxy evolution .",
    "for example , @xcite find significant differences in the properties ( e.g. , colors and nuclear activity ) of neighbouring companions of type1 and type2 agn hosts .",
    "they suggest that a significant fraction of type2 agns are produced as a result of a merger , where dense gas and dust obscure the central accretion disk and broad - line region .",
    "the agn then transforms into a type1 once it blows away a significant fraction of the dusty torus to reveal the broad - line emission and continuum emission from the accretion disk .",
    "the results of @xcite seem to support such a scenario , where seyfert2 galaxies appear to have more disturbed co morphologies , and higher star formation rates @xcite relative to seyfert1 galaxies . in mrk590 and the quasar sdss j015957.64 + 003310.5 , the ` type - transitioning ' is reversed , demonstrating that agn evolution can go both ways .",
    "a type1 agn can turn off when it runs out of fuel , and thus lose the broad - line emission due to a lack of ionizing photons from the accretion disk , and thus transition into a type2 agn ( as proposed by * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that such type - transitioning behavior can occur on very short timescales of years to decades , as observed in both mrk590 and ngc4151 , shows that caution should be exercised when interpreting statistical studies involving comparisons of the host galaxy properties of type1 and type2 agn samples .",
    "a sample of type2 agns selected based solely on the absence of broad emission lines , may contain a mix of nuclei that are truly obscured , as well as unobscured nuclei that may be undergoing low accretion states or that may have turned off .",
    "the significance of such biases in studies of agn and galaxy evolution will depend on how prevalent changing - look agns are , how often such type - transitioning behavior occurs , and their duty cycles ( i.e. , the relative timescales at which an agn nucleus exhibits type1 properties compared to that of a type2 ) .",
    "these quantities are unknown at present .    the ozdes reverberation mapping program @xcite will monitor the broad emission lines of @xmath45 quasars over a five year period .",
    "such long - term spectroscopic surveys may potentially uncover more of these changing - look agns .",
    "follow - up imaging of the co line emission of such changing - look agns with alma will allow their gas reservoirs and fueling processes to be studied and compared with that of the general population of active galaxies on a statistical level .",
    "such studies will determine how unique these changing - look agns are , and promise to provide a better understanding of the intermittency of nuclear activity as well as the physics of black hole fueling in general .",
    "in this study , we investigate if the agn in mrk590 is turning off due to a lack of central gas to fuel it .",
    "we present the first interferometic maps of the molecular gas distribution ( traced by the @xmath0co(32 ) emission line ) and ( sub-)mm continuum emission in the circumnuclear regions of mrk590 .",
    "the @xmath0co(32 ) and 344ghz continuum maps at sub - arcsecond resolution were obtained with alma , while the 219ghz continuum map at 3@xmath39 resolution was obtained with the sma .",
    "the main results of our study are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we do not detect any @xmath0co(32 ) line emission in the central 150pc down to the sensitivity limit of the observations .",
    "this constrains the molecular gas mass in the centre to @xmath1 assuming @xmath2 as observed in the centres of nearby galaxies , and @xmath46 as observed in nearby seyfert galaxies .",
    "higher sensitivity observations with the full alma array will provide even stronger constraints on the gas mass .",
    "future observations and detections of other co transitions will significantly reduce the uncertainties in the h@xmath17 mass estimates arising from presently unknown excitation levels of the co gas .",
    "although we find relatively low levels of @xmath24 and @xmath47 ( estimated based on @xmath24 and using the kennicutt - schmidt relation ) in the central 150pc , there is still potentially enough gas to fuel the agn for a further @xmath3 years even if it accretes at the eddington limit .",
    "we therefore can not rule out the possibility that mrk590 may turn on again in the near future .",
    "we observe a ring - like structure of molecular gas at a radius of 1kpc , tracing regions containing faint dust lanes seen in _",
    "( _ v_-band ) images .",
    "we measure a molecular gas mass of order @xmath48 in the central 2kpc , comparable to that observed in other nearby seyfert galaxies at similar scales .",
    "mrk590 therefore does not have significantly less molecular gas at these scales , confirming that large scale structures and gas reservoirs provide no direct indication of ongoing agn activity and accretion rates .",
    "a molecular gas component with disturbed kinematics centred just @xmath5pc west of the agn may be fueling the centre .",
    "this component has sufficient h@xmath17 gas to fuel the central engine for up to @xmath49 years at the eddington - limited rate .",
    "spatially resolved gas kinematics from higher resolution co maps from alma , and from more emission lines , e.g. , @xmath50 $ ] and hi , at tens of pc to kpc scales , are required to better model the galaxy rotation curves and central gas dynamics .",
    "these additional data , which we are in the process of obtaining , will enable us to better determine the gas transport mechanisms potentially operating at these spatial scales in this source .",
    "we do not detect any strong molecular outflows ( with velocities greater than the rotational velocities ) that may be depleting the gas in the centre , down to the detection limits of our @xmath0co(32 ) spectra .",
    "the hco@xmath51(43 ) line is not detected in the alma observations .",
    "we obtain a hco@xmath51 to co integrated flux ratio of @xmath52 in the inner 2kpc .",
    "this limit on the dense gas fraction in mrk590 is consistent with that found in other nearby agn host galaxies .",
    "the @xmath0co(21 ) emission line was also not detected in the sma spectra , consistent with @xmath0co(32 ) to @xmath0co(21 ) flux ratios of @xmath53 as observed in quasar host galaxies , sub - mm galaxies , and the milky way galaxy .",
    "we detect marginally resolved continuum emission at 344ghz in the centre that is spatially coincident with the unresolved cm - wavelength radio source , where the agn is likely located .",
    "the origin of the emission is most likely thermal dust emission ( @xmath54k ) that is heated predominantly by the agn , possibly from the dusty torus posited in agn unification models .",
    "however , contributions from free - free and synchrotron emission can not be ruled out .",
    "since the emission is agn - dominated , its flux density is likely to be variable on timescales of years or decades , as has been observed in the mid - to - near - ir , optical - uv and x - ray wavelengths",
    ". continued monitoring of the ( sub-)mm flux will confirm this , and provide a better understanding of the energy coupling of the various agn components emitting at various wavelengths .",

    "we describe here the details of our model fit to the observed near - ir to ( sub-)mm continuum fluxes from published data ( table  [ continuumfluxpub ] ) and our alma observations , as discussed in section  [ thermaldust ] .",
    "the model fitting is based on the far - ir sed fitting code developed by @xcite .",
    "the code combines a far - ir greybody spectrum of a single temperature , with a near - ir to mid - ir power law function to approximate warm dust emission due to agn heating .",
    "we fix the mean emissivity index of dust particles at the typical value of @xmath55 , since we are unable to constrain it well through the model - fitting process itself with only a single point at wavelengths of @xmath56 m ( from alma ) .",
    "this value of @xmath9 has been confirmed by observations of our galaxy @xcite and nearby starburst galaxies @xcite , and is consistent with values measured in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "the other five parameters , including the temperature of the greybody component and the slope of the mid - ir power law , are kept as free parameters during the model - fitting process .",
    "the fitting procedure , the model sed and the model parameters are described in further detail by @xcite .",
    "we note that there will be large uncertainties associated with the sed model - fitting , and in the parameters ( e.g. , dust temperatures , dust masses and total far - ir luminosity ) derived from the fitted model .",
    "these uncertainties arise from :    1 .",
    "_ inconsistent beam sizes and angular resolution .",
    "_ the ukirt , _ iso _ and _ iras _ flux densities are measured using larger beam sizes compared to our alma measurements .",
    "even though the near - ir to far - ir flux densities from these instruments are very likely agn dominated , contamination from emission originating at kpc to tens of kpc scales can not be ruled out .",
    "2 .   _ systematic errors in the absolute flux scaling of the different instruments . _",
    "since the sed model fit makes use of a heterogenous dataset obtained from many different instruments , there are bound to be indeterminable uncertainties in the absolute scaling of the flux measurements from each telescope .",
    "for example , there are known discrepancies between _ iso _ flux measurements at 90@xmath57 m and _ iras _ flux measurements at 100@xmath57 m .",
    "@xcite find evidence that _ iras _ fluxes at 100@xmath57 m can be overestimated by up to @xmath1430% compared to _",
    "iso _ and _ spitzer _ fluxes at comparable wavelengths .",
    "_ possible intrinsic variability of the agn continuum emission .",
    "_ there are indications that the far and mid - ir continuum flux densities may exhibit variability consistent with the changes in the optical - uv continuum and line flux densities as reported by @xcite .",
    "the _ iso _",
    "observations in the 1990s @xcite show that the 60@xmath57 m and 90@xmath57 m flux densities have increased by factors of a few when compared to the _ iras _ observations in the 1980s @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the flux density increase observed at other wavelengths during this period .",
    "this is despite the smaller beam size of _ iso _ which measures the flux density at smaller angular scales relative to _ iras_. as mentioned above , _",
    "flux density measurements are also typically found to be consistently lower than that of _ iras_. therefore , this systematic error can not explain the higher _ iso _ flux densities compared to the _ iras _ flux densities measured for mrk590 .",
    "furthermore , the agn - dominated 12.8@xmath57 m flux densities measured in 2006 with vlt - visir @xcite are a factor of four lower than the 16@xmath57 m _ iso _ flux densities measured in the 1990s , consistent with the flux density decrease observed at other wavelengths over this time period .",
    "while angular resolution effects can not be ruled out in this case , we note that variability may also have affected the vlt - visir data .    while the far - ir flux densities of the model fit are consistently lower than the observed _ iso _ and _ iras _ flux densities ( figure  [ sedfit ] ) , the larger beam sizes of these instruments ( relative to that of alma and vlt - visir ) imply that their measured flux densities are only upper limits of the flux emanating from within the central 150pc .",
    "although ukirt also has a lower angular resolution of @xmath58 , the emission at wavelengths from 1@xmath57 m to 10@xmath57 m is expected to be completely dominated by the central agn .",
    "another possible explanation for the higher iso fluxes is the possible variability of the far - ir continuum emission .",
    "in fact , far - ir continuum variability provides a better explanation ( as opposed to angular resolution effects ) for the higher _ iso _ fluxes ( relative to the model fit values ) as seen in figure  [ sedfit ] . with the exception of the @xmath59 radio data ( crosses in figure  [ sedfit ] ) ,",
    "the _ iso _ fluxes are the only measurements obtained in the 1990s when mrk590 was accreting at its highest observed rate .",
    "all the other observational data points were obtained either in the early 1980s or from the year 2000 onwards when mrk590 was accreting at a lower rate .",
    "we therefore argue that the model sed is a reasonable fit to the data ."
