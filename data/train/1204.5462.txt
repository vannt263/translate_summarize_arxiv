    "increasingly provide experimental and theoretical evidence , how cognitive processes might be implemented by neural networks in the brain .",
    "the crucial question , how to bridge the gap , how to realize a turing machine @xcite by state and time continuous dynamical systems has been hotly debated by `` computationalists '' ( such as fodor and pylyshyn @xcite ) and `` dynamicists '' ( such as smolensky @xcite ) over the last decades . while computationalists argued that dynamical systems , such as neural networks , and symbolic architectures were either incompatible to each other , or the former were mere implementations of the latter , dynamicists have retorted that neural networks could be incompatible with symbolic architectures because the latter can not be implementations of the former ; see @xcite for discussion .    moore @xcite has proven that a turing machine can be mapped onto a generalized shift as a generalization of symbolic dynamics @xcite , which in turn becomes represented by a piecewise affine - linear map at the unit square using gdel encoding and symbologram reconstruction @xcite .",
    "these _ nonlinear dynamical automata _ have been studied and further developed by @xcite . using a similar representation of the machine tape but a localist one of the machine s control states , siegelmann and sontag",
    "have proven that a turing machine can be realized as a recurrent neural network with rational synaptic weights @xcite . along a different vain , deploying sequential cascaded networks , pollack @xcite and later moore @xcite and tabor @xcite introduced and further generalized _ dynamical automata _ as nonautonomous dynamical systems ( see @xcite for a unified treatment of these different approaches ) .    inspired by population codes studied in neuroscience , schner and co - workers devised _ dynamic field theory _ as a framework for cognitive architectures and embodied cognition where symbolic representations correspond to regions in abstract feature spaces ( e.g. the visual field , color space , limb angle spaces ) @xcite . because dynamic field theory relies upon the same dynamical equations as _ neural field theory _ investigated in theoretical neuroscience @xcite , one often speaks also about _ dynamic neural fields _ in this context .    in this communication",
    "we unify the abovementioned approaches . starting from a nonlinear dynamical automaton as point dynamics in phase space in sec .",
    "[ sec : nda ] , which bears interpretational peculiarities , we consider uniform probability distributions evolving in function space in sec .  [ sec : dfa ] .",
    "there we prove the central theorem of our proposal , that uniform distributions with rectangular support are mapped onto uniform distributions with rectangular support by the underlying nda dynamics .",
    "therefore , the corresponding dynamic field , implementing a turing machine , shall be referred to as _ dynamic field automaton_. in the concluding sec .",
    "[ sec : discu ] we discuss possible generalizations and advances of our approach .",
    "additionally , we point out that symbolic computation in a dynamic field automaton can be interpreted in terms of contextual emergence @xcite .",
    "a nonlinear dynamical automaton ( nda : @xcite ) is a triple @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a time - discrete dynamical system with phase space @xmath2 ^ 2 \\subset \\mathbb{r}^2 $ ] , the unit square , and flow @xmath3 .",

    "the nda s dynamics , obtained by iterating an orbit @xmath23 from initial condition @xmath24 through @xmath25 describes a symbolic computation by means of a generalized shift @xcite when subjected to the coarse - graining @xmath26 . to this end , one considers the set of bi - infinite , `` dotted '' symbolic sequences @xmath27 with symbols @xmath28 taken from a finite set , an alphabet @xmath29 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : symseq ] ) the dot denotes the observation time @xmath30 such that the symbol right to the dot , @xmath31 , displays the current state , dissecting the string @xmath32 into two one - sided infinite strings @xmath33 with @xmath34 as the left - hand part in reversed order and @xmath35 as the right - hand part . applying a gdel encoding @xmath36 to the pair @xmath33 , where @xmath37 is an integer gdel number for symbol @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the numbers of symbols that could appear either in @xmath40 or in @xmath41 , respectively , yields the so - called symbol plane or symbologram representation @xmath42 of @xmath32 in the unit square @xmath5 @xcite .    a generalized shift emulating a turing machine as the current tape symbol underneath the head and @xmath31 as the current control state @xmath43 .",

    "an nda @xmath65 can be constructed as follows : in the gdel encoding ( [ eq : goedel ] ) the word contained in the dod at the left - hand - side of the dot , partitions the @xmath21-axis of the symbologram into intervals @xmath66 , while the word contained in the dod at the right - hand - side of the dot partitions its @xmath22-axis into intervals @xmath67 , such that the rectangle @xmath9 ( @xmath11 ) becomes the image of the dod .",
    "moore @xcite has proven that the map @xmath68 is then represented by a piecewise affine - linear ( yet , globally nonlinear ) map @xmath13 with branches at @xmath12 .",
    "in general , a turing machine has a distinguished blank symbol , @xmath69 delimiting the machine tape and also some distinguished final states indicating termination of a computation @xcite .",
    "if there are no final states , the automaton is said to terminate with empty tape @xmath70 . by mapping @xmath71 through the gdel encoding ,",
    "the terminating state becomes a fixed point attractor @xmath72 in the symbologram representation .",
    "moreover , sequences of finite length are then described by pairs of rational numbers by virtue of eq .",
    "( [ eq : goedel ] ) . therefore , nda turing machine computation becomes essentially rational dynamics .    in the framework of generalized shifts and nonlinear dynamical automata",
    ", however , another solution appears to be more appropriate for at least three important reasons : firstly , siegelmann @xcite further generalized generalized shifts to so - called analog shifts , where the doe @xmath73 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : genshift3 ] ) could be infinity ( e.g. by replacing the finite word @xmath74 in the dod by the infinite binary representation of @xmath75 ) .",
    "secondly , the nda representation of a generalized shift should preserve structural relationships of the symbolic description , such as the word semigroup property of strings .",
    "beim graben et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that a representation of finite strings by means of equivalence classes of infinite strings , the so - called cylinder sets in symbolic dynamics @xcite lead to monoid homomorphisms from symbolic sequences to the symbologram representation .",
    "then , the empty word @xmath76 , the neutral element of the word semigroup , is represented by the unit interval @xmath77 $ ] of real numbers . and",
    "thirdly , beim graben et al . @xcite",
    "combined ndas with dynamical recognizers @xcite to describe interactive computing where symbols from an information stream were represented as operators on the symbologram phase space of an nda . there , a similar semigroup representation theorem holds .    for these reasons , we briefly recapitulate the cylinder set approach here . in symbolic dynamics ,",
    "a cylinder set is a subset of the space @xmath47 of bi - infinite sequences from an alphabet @xmath29 that agree in a particular building block of length @xmath78 from a particular instance of time @xmath79 , i.e. @xmath80_t \\nonumber \\\\      & = & \\ { s \\in \\mathbf{a}^{\\mathbb{z } } \\,| \\ , s_{t + k - 1 } = a_{i_k } , \\quad k = 1 , \\dots , n \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is called @xmath81-cylinder at time @xmath82 .",
    "when now @xmath83 the cylinder contains the dotted word @xmath84 and can therefore be decomposed into a pair of cylinders @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes reversed order of the defining strings again . in the gdel encoding ( [ eq : goedel ] ) each cylinder has a lower and an upper bound , given by the gdel numbers 0 and @xmath87 , @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "then @xmath89 where the suprema have been evaluated by means of geometric series .",
    "thereby , each part cylinder @xmath90 is mapped onto a real interval @xmath91 \\subset [ 0 , 1]$ ] and the complete cylinder @xmath92 onto the cartesian product of intervals @xmath93 ^ 2 $ ] , i.e. onto a rectangle in unit square .",
    "in particular , the empty cylinder , corresponding to the empty tape @xmath94 is represented by the complete phase space @xmath2 ^ 2 $ ] .    fixing the prefixes of both part cylinders and allowing for random symbolic continuation beyond the defining building blocks , results in a cloud of randomly scattered points across a rectangle @xmath95 in the symbologram .",
    "these rectangles are consistent with the symbol processing dynamics of the nda , while individual points @xmath96 ^ 2 $ ] no longer have an immediate symbolic interpretation .",
    "therefore , we refer to arbitrary rectangles @xmath97 ^ 2 $ ] as to nda macrostates , distinguishing them from nda microstates @xmath98 of the underlying dynamical system . in other words ,",
    "the symbolically meaningful macrostates are emergent on the microscopic nda dynamics .",
    "we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : discu ] how a particular concept , called contextual emergence , could describe this phenomenon @xcite .",
    "from a conceptional point of view it does not seem very satisfactory to include such a kind of stochasticity into a deterministic dynamical system .",
    "however , as we shall demonstrate in this section , this apparent defect could be easily remedied by a change of perspective . instead of iterating clouds of randomly prepared initial conditions according to a deterministic dynamics , one could also study the deterministic dynamics of probability measures over phase space . at this higher level of description , introduced by koopman et al .",
    "@xcite into theoretical physics , the point dynamics in phase space is replaced by functional dynamics in banach or hilbert spaces .",
    "this approach has its counterpart in neural @xcite and dynamic field theory @xcite in theoretical neuroscience .    in dynamical system theory",
    "the abovementioned approach is derived from the conservation of probability as expressed by a frobenius - perron equation @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100 denotes a probability density function over the phase space @xmath5 at time @xmath82 of a dynamical system , @xmath101 refers to either a continuous - time ( @xmath102 ) or discrete - time ( @xmath103 ) flow and the integral over the delta function expresses the probability summation of alternative trajectories all leading into the same state @xmath98 at time @xmath82 .      in the case of an nda ,",
    "the flow is discrete and piecewise affine - linear on the domains @xmath12 as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ndamap ] ) . as initial probability distribution densities",
    "@xmath104 we consider uniform distributions with rectangular support @xmath105 , corresponding to an initial nda macrostate , @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the `` volume '' ( actually the area ) of @xmath108 and @xmath109 is the characteristic function for a set @xmath110 .",
    "a crucial requirement for these distributions is that they must be consistent with the partition @xmath26 of the nda , i.e. there must be a bi - index @xmath11 such that the support @xmath111 .    inserting ( [ eq : iniuni ] ) into the frobenius - perron equation ( [ eq : froper ] ) yields for one iteration @xmath112    in order to evaluate ( [ eq : froper2 ] ) , we first use the product decomposition of the involved functions : @xmath113 with @xmath114 and @xmath115 where the intervals @xmath116 are the projections of @xmath108 onto @xmath21- and @xmath22-axes , respectively .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the projections of @xmath13 onto @xmath21- and @xmath22-axes , respectively .",
    "these are obtained from ( [ eq : ndamap ] ) as @xmath119 using this factorization , the frobenius - perron equation ( [ eq : froper2 ] ) separates into @xmath120 } \\delta(x - a^{\\nu}_x - \\lambda^{\\nu}_x x ' ) u_x(x ' , t ) { \\ , \\mathrm{d}}x ' \\\\",
    "\\label{eq : fpy }      u_y(y , t + 1 ) & = & \\int_{[0 , 1 ] } \\delta(y - a^{\\nu}_y - \\lambda^{\\nu}_y y ' ) u_y(y ' , t ) { \\ , \\mathrm{d}}y'\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    next , we evaluate the delta functions according to the well - known lemma @xmath121 where @xmath122 indicates the first derivative of @xmath123 in @xmath124 .",
    "( [ eq : evadelta ] ) yields for the @xmath21-axis @xmath125 i.e. one zero for each @xmath126-branch , and hence @xmath127 inserting ( [ eq : evadelta ] ) , ( [ eq : zeros ] ) and ( [ eq : slope ] ) into ( [ eq : fpx ] ) , gives @xmath128 } \\frac{1}{\\lambda^{\\nu}_x } \\delta\\left ( x ' - \\frac{x - a^{\\nu}_x}{\\lambda^{\\nu}_x } \\right ) u_x(x ' , t ) { \\ , \\mathrm{d}}x ' \\\\      & = & \\sum_\\nu \\frac{1}{\\lambda^{\\nu}_x } u_x\\left ( \\frac{x - a^{\\nu}_x}{\\lambda^{\\nu}_x } , t \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    next , we take into account that the distributions must be consistent with the nda s partition . therefore ,",
    "for given @xmath129 there is only one branch of @xmath13 contributing a simple zero to the sum above .",
    "hence , @xmath130    the evolution of uniform p.d.f.s with rectangular support according to the nda dynamics eq .",
    "( [ eq : froper2 ] ) is governed by @xmath131    * proof ( by means of induction ) .",
    "inserting the initial uniform density distribution ( [ eq : iniuni ] ) for @xmath30 into eq .",
    "( [ eq : uniter ] ) , we obtain by virtue of ( [ eq : decounix ] ) @xmath132 deploying ( [ eq : charfn ] ) yields @xmath133 let now @xmath134 \\subset [ 0 , 1]$ ] we get @xmath135 where we made use of ( [ eq : mapx ] ) .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath136 with @xmath137 = \\phi_x(i_0)$ ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath138    the same argumentation applies to the @xmath22-axis , such that we eventually obtain @xmath139 with @xmath140 the image of the initial rectangle @xmath105 .",
    "thus , the image of a uniform density function with rectangular support is a uniform density function with rectangular support again .",
    "assume ( [ eq : fpuniform ] ) is valid for some @xmath141 .",
    "then it is obvious that ( [ eq : fpuniform ] ) also holds for @xmath142 by inserting the @xmath21-projection of ( [ eq : fpuniform ] ) into ( [ eq : uniter ] ) using ( [ eq : decounix ] ) , again .",
    "then , the same calculation as under 1 . applies when every occurrence of @xmath143 is replaced by @xmath82 and every occurrence of @xmath144 is replaced by @xmath142 .    by means of this construction",
    "we have implemented an nda by a dynamically evolving field .",
    "therefore , we call this representation _ dynamic field automaton ( dfa)_.      the frobenius - perron equation ( [ eq : froper2 ] ) can be regarded as a time - discretized amari dynamic neural field equation @xcite which is generally written as @xmath145 here , @xmath146 is the characteristic time constant of activation decay , @xmath147 denotes the synaptic weight kernel , describing the connectivity between sites @xmath148 and @xmath123 is a typically sigmoidal activation function for converting membrane potential @xmath149 into spike rate @xmath150 .",
    "discretizing time according to euler s rule with increment @xmath151 yields @xmath152 for @xmath153 and @xmath154 the amari equation becomes the frobenius - perron equation ( [ eq : froper2 ] ) when we set @xmath155 this is the general solution of the kernel construction problem @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath13 is not injective , i.e.  for fixed @xmath21 the kernel is a sum of delta functions coding the influence from different parts of the space @xmath156 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "note further that higher - order discretization methods of explicit or implicit type such as the runge - kutta scheme could be applied to eq .",
    "( [ eq : amari ] ) as well .",
    "but in this case the relationship between the turing dynamics as expressed by the frobenius - perron equation ( [ eq : froper ] ) and the neural field dynamics would become much more involved .",
    "we leave this as an interesting question for further research .",
    "in this communication we combined nonlinear dynamical automata as implementations of turing machines by nonlinear dynamical systems with dynamic field theory , where computations are characterized as evolution in function spaces over abstract feature spaces . choosing the unit square of ndas as feature space we demonstrated",
    "that turing computation becomes represented as dynamics in the space of uniform probability density functions with rectangular support .",
    "the suggested framework of dynamic field automata may exhibit several advantages .",
    "first of all , massively parallel computation could become possible by extending the space of admissible p.d.f.s . by allowing either for supports that overlap the partition of the underlying nda or for multimodal distribution functions",
    ", one could prepare as many symbolic representations one wants and process them in parallel by the dfa .",
    "moreover , dfas could be easily integrated into wider dynamic field architectures for object recognition or movement preparation .",
    "they could be programmed for problem - solving , logical interferences or syntactic language processing .",
    "in particular , bayesian inference or the processing of stochastic grammars could be implemented by means of appropriate p.d.f.s .    for those applications",
    ", dfas should be embedded into time - continuous dynamics .",
    "this involves the construction of more complicated kernels through solving inverse problems along the lines of potthast et al .",
    "we shall leave these questions for future research .",
    "the construction of dfas has also interesting philosophical implications .",
    "one of the long - standing problems in philosophy of science was the precise relationship between point mechanics , statistical mechanics and thermodynamics in theoretical physics : is thermodynamics merely reducible to point mechanics via statistical mechanics ? or are thermodynamic properties such as temperature emergent on mechanical descriptions ?",
    "due to the accurate analysis of bishop and atmanspacher @xcite , point mechanics and statistical mechanics simply provide two different levels of description : on one hand , point mechanics deals with the dynamics of microstates in phase space . on the other hand , statistical mechanics , in the formulation of koopman et al .",
    "@xcite ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : dfa ] ) , deals with the evolution of probability distributions over phase space , namely macrostates , in abstract function spaces .",
    "both are completely disparate descriptions , none reducible to the other .",
    "however , the huge space of ( largely unphysical ) macrostates must be restricted to a subspace of physically meaningful thermal equilibrium states that obey a particular stability criterium ( essentially the maximum - entropy principle ) .",
    "this restriction of states bears upon a contingent context , and in this sense , thermodynamic properties have been called _ contextually emergent _ by @xcite .",
    "our construction of dfas exhibits an interesting analogy to the relationship between mechanical micro- and thermal macrostates : starting from microscopic nonlinear dynamics of an nda , we used the frobenius - perron equation for probability density functions in order to derive an evolution law of macrostates : the time - discretized amari equation ( [ eq : amari ] ) with kernel ( [ eq : nftkernel ] ) .",
    "however , with respect to the underlying nda , not every p.d.f . can be interpreted as a symbolic representation of a turing machine configuration .",
    "therefore , we had to restrict the space of all possible p.d.f.s , by taking only uniform p.d.f.s with rectangular support into account . for those macrostates we were able to prove that the resulting dfa implements the original turing machine .",
    "in this sense , the restriction to uniform p.d.f.s with rectangular support introduces a contingent context from which symbolic computation emerges .",
    "( note that uniform p.d.f.s also have maximal entropy ) .",
    "this research was supported by a heisenberg grant ( gr 3711/1 - 1 ) of the german research foundation ( dfg ) awarded to pbg .",
    "preliminary results have been presented at a special session `` cognitive architectures in dynamical field theory '' , that was partially funded by an eucogiii grant , at the 2nd international conference on neural field theory , hosted by the university of reading ( uk ) .",
