    "linear system stability can be formulated algebraically in the space of coefficients of the characteristic polynomial .",
    "the region of stability is generally _ nonconvex _ in this space , and this is a major obstacle when solving fixed - order or robust controller design problems . in the case of discrete - time linear systems , the region of stability is a bounded open set whose boundary consists of ( flat ) hyperplanes and nonconvex ( negatively curved ) algebraic varieties .",
