    "compact objects in the low - mass x - ray binaries(lmxbs ) takes much attention to the astrophysicists for the last few years . in lmxbs , possible compact objects are neutron star / strange star .",
    "neutron stars are composed almost entirely of neutrons , while strange stars are of quark matter , or strange matter .",
    "few hundred of lmxbs have been detected in the milky way , and only very few lmxbs have been discovered in globular clusters .",
    "chandra x - ray observatory data has revealed lmxbs in many distant galaxies . a low - mass x - ray binary emits radiation mostly in x - rays .",
    "they emit radiation which is less than one percent in visible region .",

    "many researchers studied@xcite compact stars in various directions . scientists used different techniques such as computational , observational or theoretical analysis to study astrophysical objects.tolman@xcite proposed an isotropic static solutions for a sphere of fluid .",
    "he pointed out that due to some complexity of the vii - th solution ( among the eight different solutions ) , it is not possible to explain the physical behavior(obviously there is a misprint in the original article in tolman vii solution)of a star .",
    "we have some curiosities about the conclusion .",
    "therefore , considering the isotropic model ( which tolman assume ) , we wanted to explain the physical behaviour of the compact objects in the low - mass x - ray binaries by taking the corrected metric .    in this article , we compare our results ( mass , radius , central density , surface density and surface red - shift ) with the compact stars in the lmxbs and it is found to be consistent with the reported datas@xcite .",
