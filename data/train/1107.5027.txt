    "improved staggered fermion actions are widely used to study qcd at non - zero temperatures and densities , see e.g. ref .",
    ". however , discretization effects for staggered fermion actions are quite large in the low temperature region . to control the discretization effects it is important to perform calculations for large values of temporal extent @xmath5 or use actions with smallest possible discretization effects .",
    "here we report the study of the chiral and deconfinement aspects of the finite temperature transition using the asqtad and hisq / tree action on lattices with temporal extent @xmath6 and @xmath2 with light quark masses @xmath7 with @xmath8 the physical strange quark mass .",
    "this corresponds to the lightest pion mass of about @xmath9 mev .",
    "the lattice spacing was set using the static potential .",
    "the details of the lattice setup and analysis were in part presented in @xcite and will be discussed in a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
    "for vanishing light quark masses there is a chiral phase transition which is expected to be second order and thus governed by universal @xmath10 scaling . however , even for non - vanishing light quark masses , provided they are small enough , universal scaling allows to define pseudo - critical temperatures for the chiral transition .",
    "thus when studying the chiral transition one first needs to establish that the lattice results can be described in terms of @xmath10 scaling . in the staggered fermion formulation",
    "there is one further complication .",
    "since this formulation only preserves a part of the chiral symmetry , the relevant universality class in the chiral limit for non - vanishing lattice spacing is actually @xmath11 .",
    "fortunately , in the numerical analysis the differences between @xmath11 and @xmath10 universality classes are small so when referring to scaling we will use the term @xmath3 scaling .",
    "previous studies with the p4 action provided evidence for @xmath3 scaling @xcite . therefore we would like to check if @xmath3 scaling works for asqtad and hisq / tree action . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbp ] we show our numerical results obtained with hisq / tree action for the order parameter     ( left ) and @xmath12 ( right ) lattices together with the scaling fits.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   ( left ) and @xmath12 ( right ) lattices together with the scaling fits.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    @xmath13    for @xmath0 and @xmath14 we also made use of preliminary results at smaller quark mass @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "we performed a fit of @xmath16 to the scaling form @xmath17 here we defined @xmath18 and the reduced temperature @xmath19 and the magnetic field @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 is the critical temperature in the chiral limit .",
    "furthermore , @xmath23 parametrizes the contribution from the regular part of the free energy density . by performing a 5 parameter fit of the numerical results on @xmath16 ,",
    "i.e. treating @xmath24 and @xmath25 as fit parameters we can describe the temperature and quark mass dependence of @xmath16 . both @xmath10 and @xmath11 scaling fits",
    "work well .",
    "the pseudo - critical temperature can be defined as peak position of the chiral susceptibility @xmath26 since the scaling ansatz describes the quark mass dependence and temperature dependence of @xmath16 and @xmath27 it can be used to determine the peak positions for different @xmath5 for the physical value of the light quark mass @xmath28 . then performing a combined @xmath29 extrapolation of @xmath30 values obtained with asqtad and hisq / tree action as shown in fig .",
    "2 we obtain @xmath31 where the first error is statistical , the second error is the systematic error due to continuum extrapolations and uncertainties related to the differences in @xmath11 and @xmath10 scaling fits , and the last error is the overall error on the lattice scale determination . to present a combined error",
    "we add the first two errors in quadrature and then add the third one .",
    "this gives @xmath32 mev .",
    "the polyakov loop is an order parameter for the deconfinement transition in pure gauge theory , which is governed by @xmath33 symmetry .",
    "for qcd this symmetry is explicitly broken by dynamical quarks .",
    "there is no obvious reason for the polyakov loop to be sensitive to the singular behavior close to the chiral limit although speculations along these lines have been made @xcite .",
    "the polyakov loop is related to the screening properties of the medium and thus to deconfinement .",
    "after proper renormalization , the square of the polyakov loop characterizes the long distance behavior of the static quark anti - quark free energy ; it gives the excess in free energy needed to screen two well - separated color charges .",
    "the renormalized polyakov loop has been studied in the past in pure gauge theory @xcite as well as in qcd with two @xcite , three @xcite and two plus one flavors @xcite .",
    "the renormalized polyakov loop , calculated on lattices with temporal extent @xmath34 , is obtained from the bare polyakov @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the additive normalization of the static potential chosen such that it coincides with the string potential at distance @xmath38 with @xmath39 being the sommer scale .",
    "the numerical results for the renormalized polyakov loop for the hisq / tree action are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tc_and_lren ] as function of @xmath40 .",
    "as one can see from the figure the cutoff ( @xmath5 ) dependence of the renormalized polyakov loop is small .",
    "we also compare our results with the continuum extrapolated stout results @xcite and the corresponding results in pure gauge theory @xcite .",
    "we find good agreement between our results and the stout results .",

    "we have studied the chiral and deconfinement aspects of the finite temperature transition in qcd .",
    "the chiral pseudo - critical temperature defined as peak of the chiral susceptibility for the physical quark masses was found to be @xmath42 mev . the chiral transition temperature obtained in refs . @xcite using different observables was found to be in the range @xmath43 mev in good agreement with our result .",
    "previous attempt to determine the chiral transition temperature by rbc - bielefeld collaboration resulted in too high value of @xmath44 mev because no reliable continuum extrapolation can be done by using only @xmath45 and @xmath46 lattices . the renormalized polyakov loop does not show rapid change in the vicinity of the chiral transition temperature and is quite different from the pure gauge theory result .",
