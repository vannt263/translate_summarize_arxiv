    "we consider the possibility of using of @xmath0 meson decays with missing energy , to test the models with a light spin-0 dm particle .",
    "dark matter search in heavy meson ( and in particular @xmath0 meson ) decays may be complimentary to such experiments as dama @xcite , cdms @xcite and xenon @xcite , which rely on the measurement of kinematic recoil of nuclei in dm interactions and lose ( for cold dm particles ) sensitivity with decreasing mass of the wimp , as the recoil energy becomes small .",
    "so far , @xmath0 meson decays into dark matter have been considered within the models , where dm particles interaction with an ordinary matter is mediated by some light degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "apart from desire of having dm annihilation enhancement ( due to a light intermediate resonance ) and thus having no tension with the dm relic abundance condition @xcite-@xcite , it is also known that @xmath0 meson sm decay is predominantly due to strong interactions .",
    "thus , the wimp production branching ratio , in general , is greatly suppressed compared to relevant weak b decays , and in particular to @xmath1 transition @xcite . in light of this",
    ", it might seem natural to concentrate only on the models within which dark matter production in @xmath0 decays is enhanced due to exchange of a light particle propagator .",
    "yet , our aim is to study @xmath2 decay into a pair of spin-0 dm particles , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 decay into a pair of spin-0 dm particles and a photon , @xmath5 , within the models where light dark matter interaction with an ordinary matter is due to exchange of _ heavy _ particles ( with masses exceeding the bottomonium mass ) .",
    "these models may be free of tension related to satisfying the dm relic abundance constraint as well @xcite .",
    "also , new experimental data on @xmath0 decays into invisible states have been reported by the babar collaboration @xcite . according to these data , @xmath6 and @xmath7 where the interval in the r.h.s .",
    "( [ i3 ] ) is related to the choice of the final state missing mass .",
    "these bounds are significantly stronger than those on invisible @xmath2 decays ( with or without a photon emission ) , reported previously by belle and cleo @xcite and quoted by particle data group @xcite .",
    "we show that babar experimental data on @xmath0 meson invisible decays may constrain the parameter space of light scalar dark matter models , even if there is no dark matter production enhancement due to light intermediate states .",
    "we also illustrate that the study of dark matter production in @xmath0 decays allows us to test regions of parameter space of light spin-0 dm models that are inaccessible for b meson decays with missing energy .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that @xmath0 decays are sensitive to a wider range of wimp mass than b decays .",
    "thus , the study of wimp production in @xmath0 decays is complementary to that for b meson decays .    at the energy scales , associated with @xmath0",
    "decays , heavy intermediate degrees of freedom may be integrated out , thus leading to a low - energy effective theory of four - particle interactions .",
    "our strategy would be deriving first model - independent formulae for the @xmath8 and @xmath5 branching ratios within the low - energy effective theory .",
    "then , we confront our predictions with the experimental data , deriving model - independent bounds in terms of the wilson operator expansion coefficients , as the parameters that carry the information on an underlying new physics model .",
    "finally , within a given model , using the matching conditions for the wilson coefficients , we translate these bounds into those on the relevant parameters of the considered model .",
    "the talk is based on the results presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we treat @xmath0 states - neglecting the sea quark and gluon distributions - as bound states of @xmath9 valence quark - antiquark pair that annihilates - with or without emission of a photon - into a pair of dark matter particles . to this approximation",
    ", the relevant low - energy effective hamiltonian may be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the heavy mass and @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "it is worth noting that with the notations used in ( [ g1 ] ) and ( [ g2 ] ) , all the operators @xmath14 , i=1, .. 4 , are hermitean , thus all the wilson coefficients @xmath15 must be real . if dm consists of particles that are their own antiparticles , then only first two operators in eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) would contribute .    for dm field being a complex scalar state , @xmath3 branching ratio",
    "is given by the following expression : @xmath16^{3/2 } \\label{g5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the dm particle mass and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the @xmath2 total width , mass and decay constant respectively .",
    "only operator @xmath21 contributes to the decay rate .    for @xmath22",
    "being a self - conjugate spin-0 state , @xmath23 , contribution of @xmath21 vanishes as well , as noted above .",
    "thus , one has @xmath24 this result is related to the fact that the final dm particle pair state must be a p - wave , which is impossible due to the bose - einstein symmetry of identical spin-0 particles . in what follows",
    ", @xmath25 must also vanish in higher orders in @xmath26 operator product expansion .",
    "thus , provided that dm pair production is the dominant invisible channel ( the neutrino background may be neglected @xcite ) , the signal for @xmath27 decay would imply that the light spin-0 dm field has a complex nature . no evidence for the @xmath27 mode may lead to some constraints on the parameters of the models with light complex scalar dark matter .",
    "yet , in order to derive such constraints , the experimental limit on the @xmath28 mode must be strong enough .",
    "indeed , using the numerical values of @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite , @xcite , one may rewrite eq .",

    ", one derives the following constraint on @xmath32 as a function of @xmath17 and @xmath11 : @xmath33    the behavior of the upper bound on @xmath32 with the dm particle mass and the heavy mass is presented in fig.s  [ f7]a )  and  [ f7]b ) respectively . for @xmath34 and @xmath35 ,",
    "this bound may be translated into constraints on the relevant couplings of models with a light complex spin-0 dm field . for @xmath36 or for @xmath37 , further improvement of the experimental sensitivity to @xmath28 transition",
    "is necessary .",
    "note that even for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , bound ( [ g25 ] ) still allows @xmath38 to be of the order of unity .",
    "it seems to be very unlikely to saturate such a ( rather weak ) bound , if within a given new physics model , @xmath8 transition is loop - induced .",
    "thus , bound ( [ g25 ] ) on @xmath32 seems to be useful only within the models , where @xmath8 decay occurs at tree level .",
    "further discussion of the scenarios with complex scalar dark matter goes beyond the scope of this talk . yet , in ref .",
    "@xcite we use bound ( [ g25 ] ) to derive constraints on the parameter space of the models with mirror fermions , in particular on that of the mssm with gauge mediated susy breaking and the dm particle in the hidden sector , while mirror fermions being connectors between the hidden and the mssm sectors .",
    "we derive for the first time bounds on the couplings of b - quark interactions with its mirror counterpart , as functions of the wimp mass and the mirror fermion mass .    for the scenarios with the dm particle being its own antiparticle , the decay @xmath39 is relevant .",
    "as the neutrino background is negligible @xcite , @xmath39 may be the dominant channel in the @xmath40 mode .",
    "as it was mentioned above , the strongest experimental constraint on @xmath41 is that derived by the babar collaboration @xcite and given by eq .",
    "( [ i3 ] ) .",
    "it may also be written as @xmath42 for the final state missing mass being less than 7  gev , or approximately @xmath43 .",
    "we have to note however that this bound has been derived assuming that @xmath40 transition is mediated by an intermediate resonant higgs state @xmath44 that exists in the mssm extensions with an additional higgs singlet @xcite .",
    "for the models with non - resonant dm production considered here , bound ( [ i13 ] ) may be used only to get _ a preliminary estimate _ of possible constraints on parameters of light spin-0 self - conjugate dm models @xcite , the only existing constraint for the case of two - particle invisible states and the photon having non - monochromatic energy , @xmath45 @xcite , is too weak to have any use .",

    "@xcite should be extended to the cases , when the emitted photon energy is non - monochromatic and is in the range @xmath48 . to our knowledge , this work is in progress now .     as a function of @xmath17 , for @xmath49.,width=302 ]    within self - conjugate scalar dm scenarios ,",

    "notice , however , that within certain models with light spin-0 dark matter , the wilson coefficients @xmath55 and/or @xmath56 may be enormously large , as they contain some enhancement factors , such as the ratio @xmath57 - due to the mass term in the numerator of a heavy fermion propagator , or the higgs vev s ratio @xmath58 ( with the latter being , say , @xmath59 ) - due to dm particle pair production via exchange of a heavy non - sm higgs degree of freedom .",
    "these enhancement factors can make @xmath55 and/or @xmath56 to be @xmath60 and hence @xmath61 to be @xmath62 , i.e. significantly exceeding bound ( [ i13 ] ) on @xmath41 . using bound ( [ i13 ] ) yields @xmath63 the behavior of the bound on @xmath64 with the dm particle mass is presented in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] for @xmath49 .    in the next section we consider the simplest possible model where",

    "@xcite , we consider type - ii version of 2hdm , where @xmath69 generates masses of down - type quarks and charged leptons , whereas @xmath70 generates masses of up - type quarks .",
    "we assume for the higgs vev s ratio to be large , i.e. @xmath71 .",
    "three coupling constants entering lagrangian  ( [ t1 ] ) are unknown parameters .",
    "constraints on the couplings @xmath72 and @xmath73 may be derived from the study of @xmath74 transition .",
    "those , in general , are strong enough : combined with the ones coming from the dm relic abundance condition , they rule out a wide range of the wimp mass for the scenarios with @xmath72 and/or @xmath73 dominant @xcite .    yet , due to cancellation effects in the relevant diagrams , wimp pair production rate in b meson decays is insensitive to the value of @xmath75 @xcite",
    ". the scenarios with @xmath75 dominant , or at least non - negligible , are thus far unconstrained .",
    "study of dm production in @xmath0 decays enables one to constrain these scenarios , inaccessible by b meson decays with missing energy .",
    "the model contains two cp - even , one cp - odd and two complex charged physical higgs degrees of freedom . to the leading order in the perturbation theory ,",
    "@xmath39 transition occurs at tree level by exchange of a single higgs boson . to this approximation ,",
    "only the cp - even higgs states , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , are relevant for our analysis .",
    "one of the cp - even higgs bosons ( not - necessarily the lightest one ) is standard model - like : its phenomenology is similar to that of the sm higgs boson and the experimental bound on its mass is close to the sm limit ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "contribution of the diagrams with the sm - like higgs boson exchange to the @xmath39 decay amplitude has no any enhancement factor - thus , we may further disregard the dark matter interaction with the sm - like cp - even higgs .",
    "the other cp - even higgs boson is `` new - physics ( np ) like '' : its phenomenology differs drastically from that of the sm higgs boson @xcite .",
    "if dark matter is produced due to exchange of this higgs particle , @xmath39 decay amplitude is enhanced by @xmath58 factor . as discussed above , in this case",
    "the decay branching ratio is within the reach of the babar experimental sensitivity .",
    "if the np - like higgs is the lightest one , its mass may be much below the standard model experimental limit : according the existing experimental data @xcite , @xmath78 or @xmath79 in the general type  ii 2hdm . as it was mentioned above , the light higgs scenario is beyond the scope of the present paper , thus we assume here that @xmath78 .",
    "notice , however , that this bound is derived , provided that no invisible higgs decay mode exists . on the other hand ,",
    "if the np - like higgs invisible decay mode is dominant , it may escape detection .",
    "no bound on @xmath80 , to our best knowledge , exists in that case .    within the considered model with light scalar dark matter , analysis of the @xmath81 mode",
    "may restrict the scenarios with an invisibly decaying lightest higgs boson by putting severe constraints on the @xmath82 interaction coupling , @xmath83 .",
    "for @xmath84 it is given by @xmath85 the last term in the r.h.s .",
    "of ( [ l9 ] ) , although being suppressed by a factor of @xmath86 , must be retained because of possible hierarchy in the values of @xmath75 and @xmath72 or @xmath73 .",
    "scenarios with such a hierarchy may be of importance : using the matching conditions for the wilson coefficients , @xmath87 and bound ( [ g27 ] ) on @xmath64 , one finds that @xmath83 is constrained to be @xmath88 , if @xmath76 mass approaches to its lower limit , @xmath65 .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] for @xmath66 and @xmath67 .    for @xmath83 being",
    "so strongly constrained , it seems to be very unlikely that @xmath76 would escape detection and its mass be below 55 gev .",
    "more rigorously , however , detailed re - analysis of the higgs production and decay rates , including that of @xmath89 , should be performed .",
    "one can show @xcite that when choosing @xmath58 sufficiently large , bound on @xmath83 may still be rigorous , if the @xmath76 mass is heavier than 55 gev .",
    "thus , within the type  ii 2hdm with a light spin-0 dark matter , study of @xmath81 decay channel may lead to severe constraints on the lightest cp - even higgs invisible decay coupling , if that higgs is new - physics like .",
    "the remarkable feature of the model is that constraints on the parameter space are derived even if the np - like higgs is the heaviest cp - even one .",
    "we illustrate this choosing @xmath90 - the existing theoretical upper bound on the sm - like higgs boson @xcite and exclusion of the sm higgs mass interval @xmath91 with 95% c. l. by the cdf and d0 data @xcite allow us to infer that above 160 gev , the cp - even higgs boson is presumably the heaviest one and np - like . the matching conditions for the wilson coefficients are now @xmath92 thus , bound ( [ g27 ] ) on @xmath64 may be transformed into that on @xmath93 as a function of the wimp mass , @xmath58 and the heaviest cp - even higgs mass .    as one can see from fig .",
    "[ f5]a ) , for @xmath94 and @xmath95 , @xmath75 is constrained to be of order of the sm weak coupling or smaller ( @xmath96 ) , if @xmath97 .",
    "also , for the same choice of the higgs mass and @xmath58 , @xmath93 is to be less than one , if the wimp mass is less than 2 gev . bound on @xmath93",
    "is significantly more rigorous for higher values of @xmath58 .",
    "for instance , if choosing @xmath98 , one gets @xmath99 and @xmath100 for @xmath97 and @xmath101 respectively .",
    "the restrictions on @xmath93 are essential also for higher values of the heaviest cp - even higgs mass : for @xmath102 , they are still of the interest up to @xmath103 , as one can see from fig .",
    "[ f5]b ) .",
    "thus , within the type  ii 2hdm with a scalar dark matter , for large @xmath58 scenario , @xmath0 meson decay into a dark matter particles pair and a photon , @xmath104 , may be used to derive essential constraints on the parameters of the model , which otherwise can not be tested by b meson decays with invisible outcoming particles .",
    "thus , spin-0 dark matter production in @xmath0 meson decays has been investigated .",
    "we restricted ourselves by consideration of the models where the decays occur due to exchange of heavy non - resonant degrees of freedom .",
    "we performed our calculations within low - energy effective theory , integrating out heavy degrees of freedom .",
    "this way we derived model - independent formulae for the considered branching ratios .",
    "we used these formulae to confront our theoretical predictions with existing experimental data on invisible @xmath0 decays , both in a model - independent way and within particular models .",
    "it has been shown that within the considered class of models , dm production rate in @xmath0 decays is within the reach of the present experimental sensitivity .",
    "thus , @xmath0 meson decays into dark matter , with or without a photon emission , may be used to constrain the models with a gev or lighter spin-0 dm .    experimental constraints on the @xmath40 mode are derived assuming that dark matter is produced by exchange of a light resonant scalar state . within the scenarios with non - resonant dm production considered here ,",
    "these constraints may be used only to make preliminary estimates of possible bounds on the parameters of the models . yet",
    ", those estimates show that these bounds may be rigorous enough ; besides , they are derived within the least restrained presently light scalar dm scenarios .",
    "our goal is thus to encourage the experimental groups to analyze the experimental data on @xmath105 also for the case of non - monochromatic photon emission and spin-0 invisible states .",
    "so , from our analysis one may conclude that dark matter production in @xmath0 meson decays may serve as an interesting alternative to commonly used dm search methods , capable of providing a valuable information on dm particles , if those turn to have a mass of the order of a few gev or smaller .",
