    "studies of stellar rotation in the pleiades go back decades ; indeed , pleiads are included in the seminal analysis by @xcite of the evolution of rotation and activity in sun - like stars .",
    "spectroscopic @xmath6  sin  @xmath7 measurements were quickly obtained for large numbers of cluster members ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but inclination - independent measurements of rotation periods ( ) took longer to accumulate , reflecting the observationally intensive nature required of monitoring programs conducted with photometers or small field - of - view imagers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this changed dramatically with the hatnet exoplanet - search program , which monitored @xmath8100 square degrees including much of the cluster and produced periods for 368 pleiads @xcite .",
    "however , while these authors achieved a 93% period - detection efficiency for 0.71.0  @xmath1  members , this efficiency dropped sharply with mass , and the number of m - dwarf pleiads with measured  remains very small ( e.g. , the few studied by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    measurements of  for single - age open - cluster members spanning a range of masses are a valuable way to test models of stellar angular - momentum evolution .",
    "these models strive to reproduce the dependence of  on mass within a cluster and the evolution of  for stars in a narrow mass range ( e.g. , the age - rotation relation for 0.81.1 @xmath1  stars ) .",
    "the recent review by @xcite provides a fuller overview of the increasingly sophisticated theoretical descriptions of processes responsible for angular - momentum loss and/or transfer . broadly speaking ,",
    "the components of such models are : a ) the initial distribution of angular - momentum states ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; b ) the mechanism and efficiency of angular - momentum loss during the protostellar / accretion phase @xcite ; c ) the efficiency and timescale of angular - momentum transport in the stellar interior ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and d ) the efficiency of angular - momentum loss from the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) onward ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the rotation rates of pleiades members have often been particularly useful in this context , as these can be used to characterize the angular - momentum content of stars that have just arrived on the zams ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the lack of  measurements for the lowest - mass pleiads has led authors seeking rotation periods for pleiades - age stars to utilize a pseudo - pleiades sample of  measured for high - mass members of m35 @xcite and periods measured for low - mass members of ngc 2516 @xcite . while combining distinct populations",
    "is sufficient for first - order investigations of angular - momentum evolution , testing second - order effects due to metallicity , cluster environment , etc .",
    ", requires that we obtain full mass sequences in many cluster environments , particularly one as well studied as the pleiades .",
    "the spot signatures from which  values are inferred also provide important clues as to the behavior of active photospheres and their influence on stellar properties .",
    "early studies identified systematic differences between the photometric colors of members of the pleiades and older open clusters such as the hyades and praesepe @xcite , and between the colors of rapidly and slowly rotating pleiads ( e.g. , figure 5 in * ? ? ?",
    "subsequent studies have documented the anomalous morphology of the pleiades cluster sequence ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and provided further evidence of connection between this morphology and rotation rates @xcite .",
    "magnetically confined starspots provide a likely physical mechanism for linking a star s rotation rate and photospheric properties : rotationally driven magnetic dynamos produce large cool spots on the photospheres of rapidly rotating stars , which simple two - component spot models predict produce photometric anomalies similar to those which are observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "uncertainties in empirical estimates of stellar parameters derived from these anomalous photometric properties could produce systematic errors in the ages , masses , and radii of spotted stars , with important ramifications for the inferred age scale for young ( 1 - 200 myr ) stars and clusters .",
    "in addition to these observational effects , starspots can significantly affect the energy transport , temperature structure , and lithium - depletion efficiency in pre - main sequence stellar interiors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , introducing additional systematic uncertainties into the parameters inferred by comparison to non - spotted stellar evolutionary models .",
    "to improve empirical constraints on the rotational evolution and photospheric properties of low - mass stars , we carried out a sensitive , wide - field multi - epoch monitoring campaign targeting the lowest - mass members of the 125-myr - old pleiades cluster .",

    "as noted earlier , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite detected offsets between the empirical pleiades cmd and that predicted by theory or empirically measured in older open clusters ( i.e. , praesepe and the hyades ) , an effect these authors attribute to the presence of cool starspots on the stellar photosphere .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also reported correlations between each star s rotation rate ( @xmath6 sin @xmath7 and respectively ) and its color / magnitude displacement , providing additional evidence that this offset is a signature of the temperature differences introduced by large starspots on the photospheres of the pleiades s fastest rotating , and thus most magnetically active , low - mass members .",
    "we utilize our expanded sample of  and homogeneous photometric data to examine this idea in section  [ sec : color_rotation ] ; for now , we simply note that the presence of this offset complicates the assignment of stellar parameters based on a member s colors and magnitudes .    to make matters worse , the color - temperature relations predicted by various models and empirical calibrations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can disagree by as much as several hundred k , adding yet another systematic uncertainty when converting from observed colors to masses and temperatures .",
    "luckily , these problems appear to be due to discrepancies at optical wavelengths : @xcite find that these offsets diminish to a negligible level at wavelengths longer than 2.2 @xmath31 m , indicating that potential errors in photometric mass estimates can be minimized by inferring masses from a star s @xmath11 magnitude .",
    "we therefore convert each pleiades member s @xmath11 to an absolute @xmath32 , adopting the distance modulus of @xmath33 5.67 measured by @xcite from vlba parallaxes.5@xmath34 level according to the formal errors in each study .",

    "we present these masses in table  [ tab : periods ] , along with other relevant stellar parameters , for all stars for which we extract a robust .    finally , we label candidate binaries by analyzing the location of cluster members in the @xmath5 versus @xmath4 cmd .",
    "we follow @xcite , who demonstrated that synthetic binary systems form a second sequence in the @xmath37 versus @xmath38 cmd that lies 0.75 mag brightward of the single - star sequence .",
    "these authors also showed that the binary sequence included systems with a wide range of mass ratios : even the lowest mass secondaries emit enough nir flux to shift a binary system significantly redward of the single - star sequence in an optical / nir cmd , and thus into the elevated binary sequence at that redder color .",
    "only when the mass ratio becomes extremely uneven ( @xmath39 = 0.2/0.03 @xmath8 7 ) does the secondary fail to contribute enough red flux to push the system well into the elevated binary sequence .",
    "we indicate the location of this binary sequence in figure  [ fig : coloroffsets ] by applying a 0.75 mag offset to the semi - empirical cluster sequence defined by @xcite , which we extend here to @xmath17 and @xmath40 .",
    "we identify candidate binaries as those cluster members with @xmath5 within 0.375 mag of the binary sequence in figure  [ fig : coloroffsets ] ; this assumes a 0.375 mag spread in both the binary and single - star populations .",
    "we flag the candidate binaries in table  [ tab : periods ] , and investigate the effects of this binary selection threshold further in figure [ fig : signif_vs_vk ] and section [ sec : color_rotation ] .",

    "no offset was apparent , however , suggesting that the offsets seen in the other colors were not due to differences in the stars @xmath5 magnitudes , but rather represented excesses in both @xmath57 and @xmath11 .",
