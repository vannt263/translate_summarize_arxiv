    "the random phase approximation ( rpa ) has provided a convenient and useful method to describe excited states of many - fermion systems .",
    "there are a number of ways to formulate the rpa @xcite . in practical point of view",
    ", we particularly mention here a configuration space formalism and a response function formalism .",
    "the configuration space formalism diagonalizes a non - hermitian matrix denoted often by @xmath1 and @xmath2 matrices which are constructed in the model space of 1 particle-1 hole ( 1p-1h ) states . in contrast , the response function formalism is based on the linear response theory and solves a bethe - salpeter equation for the response function , often in the coordinate space @xcite . the response function formalism can be formulated in various representations of basis states , and the connection between these two methods can be made by expressing response functions in the configuration space @xcite .",
    "the response function formalism of rpa becomes particularly simple when the interaction is a zero - range contact force . in that case",
    ", the excitations to particle continuum states can be treated exactly by solving the single - particle green function in the coordinate space .",
    "this method was first developed by shlomo and bertsch @xcite and subsequently applied to self - consistent calculations of nuclear giant resonances with skyrme interaction by liu and van giai @xcite .",
    "recently it has been extensively used by hamamoto , sagawa , and zhang to discuss giant resonances of neutron - rich nuclei , where the continuum effects play an essential role due to a much lower threshold energy compared with @xmath3-stable nuclei @xcite .",
    "an extension to the three dimensional space has also been carried out recently by nakatsukasa and yabana for the study of atomic clusters @xcite .",
    "the coupling between particle - particle continuum was also studied in @xmath4li by bertsch and esbensen@xcite .",
    "although it has been well known that the pairing correlation plays an important role in the ground state of open - shell nuclei , it has been neglected in applying the response function formalism to describe excited states of atomic nuclei until very recently @xcite .",
    "so far a simple filling approximation has been employed in open - shell nuclei in order to simulate the pairing correlations .",
    "however , it is important to take into account the pairing effects consistently for the study of excited states of open - shell nuclei , and thus the quasi - particle rpa ( qrpa ) should be used instead of the rpa .",
    "the aim of this paper is to generalize the formalism of shlomo and bertsch to the qrpa and discuss the effects of pairing correlations on excited states of open - shell nuclei . in this paper",
    ", we study only cases where the bcs approximation works well and thus all states in the pairing active space are bound , leaving out as a future work a self - consistent treatment of the pairing effects in the continuum using the hartree - fock - bogoliubov + rpa theory @xcite .",
    "our method is closely related to that in ref .",
    "@xcite , although details are somewhat different .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly review the formalism of shlomo and bertsch and extend it to the qrpa . in sec .",
    "iii , we apply the formalism to the isoscalar ( is ) monopole , quadrupole , and octupole modes as well as the isovector ( iv ) dipole mode of excitation of the @xmath0sn nucleus and discuss the effects of pairing correlations on the excited states .",
    "a summary is given in sec .",
    "we begin with the configuration space formalism of the rpa theory and then make a connection to the response function method .",
    "the rpa equation can be given in a compact form @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the forward and the backward amplitudes , respectively .",
    "for a residual interaction of delta - type contact force , @xmath8 , the matrix elements of @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the @xmath9-multipole mode read @xmath10 where @xmath11(@xmath12 ) denotes a particle ( hole ) state and @xmath13 is the reduced matrix element .",
    "the radial integral @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a single - particle radial wave function .",
    "we have absorbed the overall factor @xmath17 in front of the @xmath2 matrix by redefining the sign of the backward @xmath7 amplitudes .",
    "the integral ( [ eq : i ] ) can be computed by discretizing it as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the spacing of the radial coordinate .",
    "since the interaction is then given as a sum of separable form , the rpa frequencies @xmath20 can be obtained by solving the generalized rpa dispersion relation @xmath21 @xcite , where the matrices @xmath22 and @xmath23 are given by @xmath24 respectively , in the coordinate space representation . here , @xmath25 is a infinitesimal real number , and @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 note that @xmath22 is nothing but the unperturbed response function in the linear response theory .",
    "here we introduce the rpa response function which obeys a bethe - salpeter equation @xmath28 this equation can be solved in the coordinate space by matrix inversion as @xcite @xmath29 the response of the system to an external field @xmath30 is then given by @xcite @xmath31    the exact treatment of the continuum effects can be achieved by eliminating the sum of the particle states in the free response function ( [ free ] ) using the complete set of the wave function @xcite .",
    "this leads to @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the single - particle hamiltonian , and the single - particle green function is given by @xmath34 here , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the regular and irregular solutions of the hamiltonian @xmath33 at energy @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the wronskian given by @xmath39 .    in the application of the formalism to nuclear systems , we use the proton - neutron formalism which can properly take into account the couplings between the is and iv modes of excitation @xcite .",
    "the bethe - salpeter equation given by eq .",
    "( [ bs ] ) is then generalized to be @xmath40 for simplicity of the notation , we do not present below the formalism in the two - component form , although we indeed use it in the actual calculations given in the next section .    in the presence of paring correlations , the elementary excitation is a two quasi - particle excitation , rather than a particle - hole excitation .",
    "a generalization of the rpa to the qrpa is given in ref .",
    "@xcite together with relevant @xmath1 and @xmath2 matrices in the qrpa equation",
    ". a free response function in the qrpa in the configuration space representation can be constructed in a similar way to the rpa , @xmath41 with @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the bcs occupation probability and @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 is the quasi - particle energy given by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the chemical potential and the pairing gap , respectively . in the bcs approximation",
    ", @xmath49 is an eigenfunction of the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath33 with an eigen - energy @xmath50 .",
    "since the quasi - particle energy @xmath45 is not an eigenvalue of @xmath33 in general , it is not straightforward to introduce the single - particle green function ( [ green ] ) in the qrpa free response function .",
    "however , when the pairing gap is zero for states @xmath51 outside the pairing active space , the quasiparticle energy becomes an eigenvalue of the single - particle hamiltonian , i.e. @xmath52 , and @xmath53=1 .",
    "we therefore consider separately excitations among states within the pairing active space and those from the inside to the outside of the active space . to the latter model space",
    ", we apply the same procedure as the rpa response function . the free response function in the bcs approximation ( [ freebcs ] )",
    "thus becomes @xmath54 where the summations of @xmath55 and @xmath3 are restricted to the states within the pairing active space . the last term in eq .",
    "( [ freebcs2 ] ) is a correction for a double - counting of excitations within the pairing active space , which stems from the substitution of the completeness relation @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ freebcs ] ) .",
    "note that , without the pairing correlations , @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath59 , and the bcs free response function ( [ freebcs2 ] ) is identical to the corresponding response function ( [ free2 ] ) in the rpa . with this unperturbed response function ( [ freebcs2 ] )",
    ", the qrpa response function is obtained again by solving the bethe - salpeter equation ( [ bs ] ) as in the rpa theory .",
    "we now apply the continuum qrpa formalism to @xmath0sn and make a comparison between the qrpa and the rpa .",
    "we choose this system because it is a typical open - shell nucleus and also because it is a sub - shell closure nucleus where the rpa can be applied unambiguously without using the filling approximation for valence nucleons .",
    "the single - particle wave functions @xmath60 and the single - particle energies @xmath61 are obtained by solving the shrdinger equation with a woods - saxon mean - field potential . as a residual interaction @xmath62 , we use the @xmath63 and @xmath64 parts of the skyrme residual interaction , which is obtained from the second derivative of the skyrme energy functional with respect to the proton and the neutron densities . the ground state density to be used in the density - dependent @xmath64 part of the residual interaction",
    "is generated from the single - particle wave functions @xmath60 .",
    "we use the same parameters as those in ref .",
    "@xcite for the mean - field potentials and the residual interaction , i.e. , @xmath651100 mev @xmath66 , @xmath6716000 mev @xmath68 , @xmath69=0.5 , @xmath70=1 , and @xmath71=1 in the standard notation of the skyrme functional @xcite . since this model is not self - consistent , we renormalize @xmath62 for the qrpa and the rpa calculations , respectively , so that the spurious is dipole mode appears at zero excitation energy .",
    "the resultant renormalization factors are @xmath72 = 0.638 and 0.660 for rpa and qrpa , respectively .",
    "for the pairing of neutrons , we use a schematic state - independent constant pairing gap @xmath73 mev , which is estimated from the experimental binding energies of neighboring nuclei .",
    "the pairing active space which we adopt includes the levels up to the @xmath74 major shell as well as the 1g@xmath75 , 2d@xmath76 , 2d@xmath77 , 3s@xmath78 , and 1h@xmath79 levels .",

    "the external field @xmath82 for each modes is given by @xmath83 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "the lower panels show results of the qrpa calculations , while the upper panels show results of the rpa calculations without the pairing correlations as a comparison . for the latter , the levels",
    "up to 3s@xmath78 state are occupied with the occupation probability @xmath86 of 1 , while those above 1h@xmath79 state are unoccupied with @xmath87 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "arrows indicate the positions of ( q)rpa states below the threshold , where the strength function has no width .    for the monopole excitation shown in fig.1 , the rpa does not show any low - lying mode , although the experimental second lowest @xmath88 state in the @xmath0sn nucleus is observed at the excitation energy 1.874 mev , which is attributed to a paring vibration mode .",
    "the second lowest @xmath88 state in the qrpa is found at rather low energy 2.9 mev , and may couple to the pairing vibrational mode .",
    "the is giant monopole states are seen in the energy region 17@xmath8928 mev in both the qrpa and rpa calculations .",
    "the transition densities for the is monopole mode at two different energies , i.e. , @xmath20 = 2.9 mev and 21.6 mev , are shown in fig .",
    "we find that the former shows a characteristic behaviour of the pairing vibration mode while the latter shows the compressional character .",
    "for the quadrupole mode shown in fig .",
    "2 , the lowest rpa state is at 5.2 mev , in comparison with the experimental value of 1.17 mev .",
    "the transition strength is b(e2:0@xmath90)= 0.031 @xmath91 in the rpa calculation , while the experimental value is 0.2 @xmath91 .",
    "if one takes the pairing correlations into account , the low - lying 2@xmath92 rpa states goes substantially down and the lowest qrpa state appears at 2.3 mev having the transition strength b(e2:0@xmath90)= 0.107 @xmath91 , which is much closer to the experimental value . in both cases , the main peak of",
    "the is giant quadrupole resonance ( gqr ) appears at around 13 mev exhausting most of the sum rule strength .",
    "the experimental gqr is also observed at the excitation energy around 13mev@xcite . as for the octupole mode of excitations in fig .",
    "3 , the experimental value of the lowest @xmath93 state is at 2.4 mev , while the rpa and the qrpa lead to 1.4 mev and 3.0 mev , respectively .",
    "the experimental value for the corresponding transition rate is b(e3:0@xmath94)= 0.09 @xmath95 , while it is 0.159 @xmath95 and 0.0771 @xmath95 in the rpa and the qrpa , respectively .",
    "the rpa without pairing correlations underestimates the lowest @xmath93 state energy and the qrpa is more satisfactory compared with the experimental value .",
    "we summarize in table 2 the results of the rpa and the qrpa calculations together with the experimental data for the lowest 2@xmath92 and 3@xmath96 states .",
    "giant octupole resonances ( gor ) are observed in fig",
    ". 3 at the excitation energy 23 mev in both cases .",
    "results for the iv giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) are shown for rpa and qrpa in fig .",
    "4 . as is the same as in figs .",
    "13 , the structure of gdr is not much disturbed by the effect of the pairing .",
    "notice that the effect of the pairing on the low - lying quadrupole mode is opposite to that on the octupole mode . for the former ,",
    "the energy of the lowest 2@xmath92 state becomes smaller due to the pairing , with enhancement of the b(e2 ) value . on the other hand ,",
    "the qrpa raises the energy of the lowest 3@xmath96 state and the b(e3 ) value is hindered . in both cases , the qrpa gives better agreement with the experimental values compared with the rpa .",
    "these features can be understood as follows . for excitations with even parity , such as the quadrupole excitations ,",
    "transitions between the same levels are allowed in the presence of the pairing correlations .",
    "this enhances the collectivity of low - lying states , resulting in a smaller excitation energy and a larger transition strength . on the contrary ,",
    "such excitations are not allowed for odd parity excitations , e.g. , the octupole mode . in that case , the dominant excitation is from one major shell to another regardless of the pairing correlation .",
    "since the particle - hole excitations are weakened by the factor @xmath86 in the presence of the pairing , the qrpa lowers the collectivity of low - lying collective excitations with odd parity .",
    "in contrast to the low - lying modes of excitations , in general , high - lying modes are much less sensitive to the paring correlations . this is the case for all the modes of excitations shown in figs .",
    "this fact can be seen more transparently if one smears the strength functions with a finite width .",
    "we show in figs .",
    "69 the rpa and qrpa results with a finite value of @xmath25 = 0.5mev in eq .",
    "( [ freebcs2 ] ) . as",
    "one clearly sees , the two results resemble each other in the giant resonance region at energies above the threshold near 10 mev .",
    "these results are natural consequences of the pairing correlations since the configurations outside the pairing active space are the main p - h configurations for the giant resonances and thus the pairing effects should play a minor role .    a conventional approximation to treat the continuum effect is to put a nucleus in a box and discretize the continuum states by imposing a boundary condition at the edge of the box . a model space of these states is usually truncated at the maximum single - particle energy @xmath97 . since our continuum qrpa method can treat the coupling to the continuum exactly , it is interesting to compare our method with the box discretization approximation .",
    "10 shows a convergence property of the box discretization method for the is quadrupole response .",
    "we take the box size of @xmath98=10 fm , and smear the strength function with @xmath25=0.5 mev for the representation purpose .",
    "we have checked that the results do not change significantly even if we use a larger value of @xmath98 .",
    "the solid line is the result of the continuum qrpa method with the exact treatment of the continuum effect , which is the same as in fig .",
    "the dot - dashed , dashed , and thin solid lines are results of the box discretization method with truncation energy at @xmath97= 10 , 50 , and 100 mev , respectively . in the upper panel ,",
    "we use the same residual interaction for all the calculations . as one can see , the convergence with respect to the maximum energy of continuum states is extremely slow : even with @xmath97= 100 mev the peak positions are not reproduced .",
    "the peak height for the lowest energy peak is not reproduced , either .",
    "we note that the truncation of the model space shfts the position of the spurious is dipole state .",
    "it appears at 6.0 , 4.4 , and 3.7 mev for @xmath97= 10 , 50 , and 100 mev , respectively . in the lower panel ,",
    "the renormalized residual interaction is used for each value of @xmath97 so that the is dipole mode appears at zero energy .",
    "the renormalization factors are @xmath72= 0.968 , 0.776 , and 0.732 for @xmath97= 10 , 50 , and 100 mev , respectively .",
    "this procedure drastically improves the convergence . in the case of the truncation energy",
    "@xmath97= 50 mev ( dashed line ) , the exact solution is almost reproduced .",
    "the result converges at this energy and the shape of the strength function is not altered even when the states up to @xmath97= 100 mev are included .",
    "this study clearly indicates the importance of the self - consistency between the space truncation and the renormalization of the residual interaction .",
    "if this self - consistency is imposed , the box discretization method works well .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that the escape width of resonances can be obtained only when the single - particle continuum states are treated exactly as we do in this article .",
    "we proposed a qrpa model in the coordinate space to take into account the continuum effects .",
    "it is a generalization of the formalism of shlomo and bertsch for the continuum rpa to the qrpa .",
    "we treated separately the p - h excitations within the pairing active space and those between the active space and the non - active space .",
    "for the former , we explicitly used the two quasiparticle configurations in the response function in the coordinate space , while for the latter we use the single - particle green function in the coordinate space representation taking into account the coupling to the particle continuum properly .",
    "we applied the formalism to @xmath0sn and showed that the pairing correlations enhance the collectivity of the positive parity low - lying states , while that of the negative parity low - lying states are hindered .",
    "we found that the qrpa is more satisfactory in reproducing the experimental data of the energy of low - lying modes of excitation , while the giant resonances are not much affected by the pairing correlations .",
    "we would like to point out that these results however do not justify the rpa model without the pairing correlations for the study of giant resonances in open - shell nuclei , especially near the drip - lines .",
    "since the single - particle energies and wave functions could be different in principle due to the density dependence of the mean - field , the response properties even in the giant resonance region might be affected by the pairing correlations .",
    "we therefore advocate to use the qrpa all through the excitation region in open - shell nuclei .",
    "there are many possible applications of the continuum qrpa method presented in this paper .",
    "one of them is a neutrino - nucleus scattering , e.g. @xmath99c(@xmath100)@xmath99c@xmath101 @xcite and @xmath99c(@xmath102)@xmath99n @xcite , where the rpa and the qrpa have been one of the standard methods for theoretical investigations .",
    "another application will be the excitations of drip - line nuclei .",
    "because of a low energy threshold , the responses would be very sensitive to the pairing correlations . in these cases ,",
    "the pairing active space includes particle continuum states and the bcs approximation should be carefully examined .",
    "also , the residual interaction in the particle - particle channel , which we neglected in this paper , might have to be taken into account . a more sophisticated treatment of the pairing interaction is provided by the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory , which consistently describes couplings between the particle - hole and the particle - particle channels .",
    "it would be an interesting future work to develop a continuum qrpa theory based on the hfb approximation .",
