    "the numerical integration of the discrete velocity boltzmann equation provides an efficient method for the solution of isothermal , incompressible fluid flows in complex geometries @xcite . the finite - difference equation generated by the integration scheme",
    "is referred to as the lattice boltzmann equation ( lbe ) .",
    "the method can be extended to study multiphase @xcite and multicomponent @xcite flows , the hydrodynamics of polymers @xcite and suspensions @xcite , and flows under gravity @xcite .    in the extensions of the lbe described above ,",
    "the resulting momentum balance equations contain additional terms beyond the usual pressure and viscous forces .",
    "these represent forces acting on the fluid , either from external sources like gravity , or internal sources like the gas - liquid interface in a two - phase fluid .",
    "external sources can add to the total momentum of the fluid , while internal sources , being immersed within the fluid , can only exchange momentum with it .",
    "internal forces on the fluid , therefore , can always be expressed as the divergence of a stress tensor .",
    "this formulation encodes the fact that there are no local sources or sinks of momentum .",
    "the lbe , derived as it is from the boltzmann equation for a dilute gas , can only faithfully represent the hydrodynamics of a fluid with an ideal - gas equation of state and a newtonian constitutive equation @xcite .",
    "one way around this restrictive situation is to use the forced boltzmann equation to represent the additional forces that appear in the extensions described above @xcite .",
    "so far , this idea has been used mainly to model the effects of gravity @xcite and gas - liquid interfacial forces in non - ideal gases @xcite .",
    "these correspond to two special types of force distributions : in the case of gravity , the force is spatially and temporally constant , while in the case of the gas - liquid interface , the force varies both in space and time , but is only evaluated on the nodes of the computational grid .",
    "the forces in either case are _ smooth _ functions of position .",
    "however , many models of boundaries immersed in fluids require _ singular _ distributions of forces .",
    "such a description follows , for example , when a gas - liquid interface is described as a two - dimensional manifold of zero thickness instead of a three - dimensional volume of space where the density changes rapidly . in a similar mathematical idealization , a polymer in a fluid",
    "may be represented as a one - dimensional curve with a singular distribution of forces @xcite . in yet another example , at distances large compared to its radius , a sedimenting colloid can be well - approximated as a singular point force  @xcite .",
    "clearly , the range of applications of lattice boltzmann hydrodynamics can be greatly expanded if singular force densities , not necessarily located at grid points , can be incorporated into the method .    in this paper",
    "we show how to include force densities having smooth or singular distributions , located at arbitrary ( in general , off - lattice ) points into the lattice - boltzmann formulation of hydrodynamics . in the following section we first discuss the discrete representation of the forcing term in the boltzmann equation and derive a second - order accurate integration scheme for the discrete velocity forced boltzmann equation using the method of characteristics . in section",
    "[ sec : singular ] we introduce a general distribution of singular forces and using a suitable regularization of the delta function obtain a smooth but sharply peaked distribution of forces .",
    "the method is exemplified in section [ sec : singular ] for three common singular force distributions ( a stokeslet , a stresslet , and a rotlet ) and validated for the stokeslet case by comparison with fully resolved numerical simulation .",
    "finally , we show how our method can be adapted to provide a simplified description of a dilute suspension of sedimenting colloids .",
    "we end with a summary of our method and discuss potential applications .",
    "the lbe may be derived from the boltzmann equation by a two - step procedure .",
    "first , a discrete velocity boltzmann equation ( dvbe ) is obtained by retaining a finite number of terms in the hermite expansion of the boltzmann equation and evaluating the conserved the moments using a gauss quadrature @xcite .",
    "the discrete velocities @xmath0 are the nodes of the gauss - hermite quadrature .",
    "this is followed by a discretization in space and time to provide a numerical integration scheme , which is commonly called the lbe @xcite .",
    "usually a first - order explicit euler scheme is used to integrate the dvbe , which surprisingly enough , gives second - order accurate results @xcite .",
    "this is so because the discretization error has the same structure as the viscous term in the navier - stokes equation , whereby it can be absorbed by a simple redefinition of the viscosity to give second - order accuracy .",
    "the same euler scheme for the forced boltzmann equation gives a discretization error term which can be absorbed only be redefining physical quantities like the momentum and stress @xcite .",
    "below , we provide a a straightforward explanation of these redefinitions and show how they are related to the discretization error induced by the integration scheme .",
    "we begin with the discrete velocity boltzmann equation including an external acceleration field @xmath1",

    "this completes the description of the method for the numerical solution of the forced lbe .",
    "verberg and ladd have derived results equivalent to those above using a multiple scale analysis of the discrete lbe dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is not clear to us whether their analysis admits singular force densities .",
    "however , the above derivation shows that these equations are a reliable starting point even in that case .",
    "the lbe can be extended to situations where the fluctuations in the fluid density and momentum are important @xcite .",

    "we return to the issue of noise below , when we address the representation of brownian colloids as point particles ( section [ sec : fallers ] ) .",
    "in a wide variety of situations , as mentioned in the introduction , force densities may need to be defined off - lattice , and may in addition be singular .",
    "mathematically , such a force density may be written as @xmath54 where the force is localized to some manifold described parametrically as @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the measure on the manifold . any numerical method which attempts to deal with such force distributions",
    "must be reconciled with the singular nature of the force and , for grid - based numerical methods , the fact that the position of the manifold need not coincide with the nodes of the grid . in a well established numerical method @xcite , the dirac delta function in the singular force distribution",
    "is replaced by a regularized delta function which leads to a smooth distribution of forces . necessarily",
    ", this implies that the force is now no longer localized on the manifold but is sharply peaked and smooth around it .",
    "this smooth force density can now be sampled on the grid using the discretized delta function as an interpolant .",
    "thus a representation of eq .",
    "( [ singularf ] ) on the grid is obtained from @xmath57 the crucial ingredient here is the kernel function @xmath58 , which is a representation of the dirac delta function regularized on the grid .",

    ", we compare analytical solutions of the singularly forced navier - stokes equation against our numerical solutions , using lattice units @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "the most straightforward benchmark is against the initial value problem for the stokes limit @xmath67 where the nonlinearity has been discarded , incompressibility is assumed , and @xmath68 . in an infinite system , the solution is obtained in terms of the unsteady oseen tensor describing the diffusion of vorticity @xcite . in a system with periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "the oseen solution must be replaced by the hasimoto solution @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the oseen solution , the real - space hasimoto solution is not available in a simple closed form but must be evaluated numerically .",
    "however , the solution in fourier variables presents no such difficulty , and is in fact identical in both cases :    @xmath69    thus , we find it most convenient to compare fourier modes of the velocity from the numerical solution against the solution above .",
    "in particular , this provides a neat way to evaluate the performance of the method at different length scales . in fig .",

    "the departure from hydrodynamic behaviour increases progressively with the wavenumber , as expected from previous studies on the hydrodynamic behaviour of the lbe @xcite . however , there is a significant range of length scales over which our model reproduces hydrodynamic behaviour , which is not less than the scale over which hydrodynamic behaviour is obtained in the unforced lbe  @xcite .",

    "for example , the discrete stokes doublet , a dipole of two point forces , can be constructed out of monopoles of magnitude @xmath75 and separation @xmath76 and is often used as a simplified representation of a neutrally buoyant , steadily moving self - propelled particle . in figures [ fig : stresslet - comp ] and [ fig : stresslet - diff ] , we compare the velocity response of such a dipole to theoretical predictions , finding good agreement away from the immediate vicinity of the forces . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rotlet ] , we show a velocity field plot for the antisymmetric force dipole , or rotlet , which may be used as a representation of an object which rotates due to an external torque .",
    "this requires the use of four , rather than two , point forces ; we arrange these in a swastika - like fashion ( whose axes can be aligned in an arbitrary direction without significantly affecting the flow produced ) .",
    "this cancels a spurious stresslet component that arises from our regularization of the @xmath77 function for any dipole in which the forces are not collinear with the separation vector .",
    "the above examples show that the regularized delta function provides an useful way of incorporating arbitrary distributions of singular forces into the lattice boltzmann method , capable of dealing with internal as well as external forcing .",
    "the dynamics in a dilute sedimenting suspension , despite a century of investigation , still presents open questions @xcite .",
    "the problem , even for a hard - sphere suspension , is unusually difficult due to the long - ranged , many - body nature of the hydrodynamic interaction .",
    "moreover , the flow can develop structural features at large length scales , and the role of inertia , while usually negligible at the particle scale , may be significant at those scales @xcite .",
    "the stokes approximation of globally vanishing reynolds number can not thus be justified _ a priori _ in a sedimenting suspension .",
    "the full hydrodynamic problem including inertia for both fluid and particles was first simulated by ladd using a novel lattice boltzmann method @xcite .",
    "this method , though possibly the most competitive for fully resolved particles , remains computationally expensive .",
    "a considerable simplification of the hydrodynamics is possible if only the lowest order multipole of the force distribution induced on the particle surface by the no - slip boundary condition is retained .",
    "this principle was exploited previously to develop representations of polymers as strings of point particles which were then coupled to an lb fluid @xcite . a similar idea has been used @xcite to represent resolved colloids with a mesh of point particles covering their surfaces .",
    "however in the current work we simplify further , treating each colloid as a single point particle ( thereby sacrificing all near - field effects).in the colloidal context , this model was first introduced by saffman @xcite ; the finite sized particles are replaced by a singular force monopole , the stokeslet , located at the nominal centre of the particle . in saffman s original model , both the fluid and the particles have no inertia . in keeping with the comments above , our model retains inertia for the fluid , while neglecting it for the particle and for hydrodynamics at the particle scale .",
    "we thus have a momentum balance equation , @xmath78 where the sum includes contributions from the @xmath79 particles located @xmath80 and acted upon by _ external _ forces @xmath81 . in the absence of particle inertia accelerations",
    "vanish , and the particle coordinates are updated directly using the first faxn relation @xcite @xmath82 which relates the centre of mass velocity of the particle @xmath83 to the external force on it @xmath81 .",
    "the background velocity @xmath84 is the fluid velocity at the location @xmath80 _ in the absence _ of the @xmath85-th particle .",
    "the above two equations provide a complete specification of a model of sedimenting spheres , valid in the dilute limit , for dynamics at long wavelengths .",
    "the lattice boltzmann implementation of this model proceeds by first replacing the dirac delta function with the regularized delta functions to obtain a force density at the grid points @xmath86 .",
    "since the lbe evolves the total fluid velocity @xmath87 due to all particles , the background fluid velocity @xmath88 must be obtained by a careful subtraction procedure . in the absence of fluid inertia at the particle scale",
    "this can be accomplished as follows . by definition ,",
    "the fluid velocity at a node @xmath87 is the sum of the background velocity at the node @xmath89 and the velocity due to the @xmath85-th stokeslet located at @xmath80 , @xmath90 .",
    "the background velocity field at the location of the particle can be obtained using the same interpolation kernel as used for the force , @xmath91 , and using the previous relation can be written as @xmath92 appealing only to linearity and dimensional analysis , the sum above can be expressed as @xmath93 in appendix  [ sec : subtraction ] , we derive this result and show that the lattice parameter @xmath94 depends only on the system size @xmath95 and on the form of the regularization and interpolation kernels ; it is independent of viscosity @xmath25 and of the radius @xmath76 . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_ldefn ] ) , the update equation for the stokeslet positions can now be expressed in terms of the interpolated fluid velocity , without any reference to the background velocity , @xmath96 notice that replacing the background velocity in the faxn relation with the actual fluid velocity induces an effective backflow , leading to a renormalized hydrodynamic radius , @xmath97 the numerics thus places a constraint @xmath98 on the allowed values of the hydrodynamic radius @xmath76 .",
    "this numerical constraint encodes the condition that the grid points must be in the far - field of the stokeslet , the limit in which the background velocity can be obtained from the fluid velocity by subtracting a monopole contribution . in our simulations , we operate well within this limit .",
    "this almost completes the description of the lattice boltzmann implementation of our stokeslet model of sedimenting particles .",

    "as shown below , the lattice parameter @xmath94 can be calculated analytically as a function of system size .",
    "we find it convenient to fit it using a procedure described in appendix  [ sec : subtraction ] . finally , to address brownian motion of our colloids",
    ", we need to use the flbe of @xcite which imparts an appropriate thermal noise spectrum to the fluid . because of the renormalization of @xmath76 , the resulting diffusivity is generally not correct unless a further noise term is added that is the counterpart of the @xmath94 correction .",

    "knowing that the particle will otherwise diffuse as one with a much larger radius , we add a white noise term to the update rule for the model @xmath132 the variance of the extra noise is determined , by the requirement of satisfying the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , to be @xmath133    to determine the value of the offset parameter @xmath94 , we set up a simulation of a single unforced particle in periodic boundary conditions at finite temperature and disable the extra noise term discussed above , giving @xmath134 as the equation of motion of the particle .",
    "we let the simulation equilibrate for the characteristic time for momentum to diffuse across the box size , @xmath135 , before recording the displacement as a function of time .",
    "this is repeated for a number of different starting positions relative to the lb grid and a plot of @xmath136 vs. @xmath137 is used to estimate the diffusivity .",
    "we then use the stokes - einstein relation to derive a radius and use this as the offset parameter .",
    "we then test to ensure that this gives the correct sedimentation behaviour of a particle ."
