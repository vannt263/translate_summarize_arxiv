    "during the last decade many experimental and theoretical advances have been made in the field of nonequilibrium magnetotransport in 2d electron systems .",
    "the research activity was triggered by the discovery of a number of beautiful nonequilibrium phenomena , the microwave - induced resistance oscillations ( miro)@xcite in the first place , governed by the ratio @xmath0 of the radiation frequency and the cyclotron frequency @xmath1 .",
    "further experiments on the miro@xcite@xmath2@xcite led to a spectacular observation of zero resistance states ( zrs)@xcite which were later explained as a result of instability leading to the formation of current domains.@xcite    these discoveries stimulated an intense theoretical research@xcite@xmath2@xcite which has led to significant advances in understanding the nonequilibrium transport in high landau levels ( lls ) .",
    "initially , the miro were attributed to the `` _ displacement _ '' mechanism which accounts for spatial displacements of semiclassical electron orbits assosiated with the radiation - assisted scattering off disorder.@xcite the preferred direction of such displacements along the symmetry - breaking dc field oscillates as a function of @xmath0 due to a periodic modulation in the density of states ( dos ) @xmath3 in a magnetic field .",
    "the displacement mechanism results in temperature independent miro with the phase and period as those observed in the experiments .",
    "the dominant contribution to the miro was later shown to be due to the `` _ inelastic _ '' mechanism associated with a radiation - induced changes in the energy distribution of electrons.@xcite the nonequilibrium part of the distribution oscillates with energy due to the oscillatory dos and its amplitude is controlled by the inelastic relaxation time @xmath4.@xcite as a consequence , the inelastic contribution to the miro provided an explanation of the observed strong temperature dependence of the miro .",
    "further , a recent systematic study of the photoresponse revealed two additional mechanisms of the miro , `` _ quadrupole _ '' and `` _ photovoltaic_.''@xcite in the quadrupole mechanism , the microwave radiation leads to excitation of the second angular harmonic of the distribution function .",
    "the dc response in the resulting nonequilibrium state yields an oscillatory contribution to the hall part of the photoconductivity tensor which violates onsager symmetry.@xcite in the photovoltaic mechanism , a combined action of the microwave and dc fields produces non - zero temporal harmonics of the distribution function .",
    "the response of this state to an ac electric field contributes to both the longitudinal and hall dc photoconductivity .",
    "the theory developed in refs .   assumed that the only relevant source of disorder potential is that created by remote ionized donors which are separated from the plane of 2d electrons by a wide spacer of width strongly exceeding the fermi wavelength , @xmath5 .",
    "such smooth disorder is characterized by scattering on small angles @xmath6 , resulting in the long transport scattering time , @xmath7 , and the backscattering time , @xmath8 ; here @xmath9 is the total disorder - induced quantum scattering time . for a smooth disorder potential",
    ", the inelastic contribution dominates over the displacement contribution for @xmath10 , the condition which is fulfilled in the whole temperature range where the miro were observed in the early experiments.@xcite the quadrupole and photovoltaic mechanisms are the only ones yielding oscillatory corrections to the hall part of the photoconductivity tensor , with the magnitude comparable to that of the displacement contribution to the diagonal part .",
    "in addition to the miro , 2d electrons exhibit nonequilibrium magnetooscillations when a strong current is applied to a sample in the absence of the microwave radiation.@xcite these oscillations in the nonlinear resistivity , called hall - induced resistance oscillations ( hiro ) , were attributed to the resonant backscattering off disorder between lls tilted by the electric field.@xcite therefore , in contrast to the miro , the hiro require a sufficient amount of short - range disorder in order to be visible in experiment .",
    "this disorder potential is created by residual charged impurities in the vicinity of the 2d electron plane .",
    "being inevitably present in quantum hall structures , such impurities are believed to limit the mobility of ultra - high mobility samples .",
    "recent experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite study of the interplay of the miro and hiro demonstrated that the displacement contribution to the miro is very sensitive to the nature of disorder .",
    "in fact , it is known that various transport phenomena in 2d electron systems crucially depend on the type of disorder , including quantum magnetooscillations in the dc and ac transport , momentum - dependent conductivity , quasiclassical memory effects , commensurability oscillations in lateral superlattices , and interaction - induced quantum magnetoresistance ( for a review , see ref .  ) .",
    "therefore , generalization of the previous studies on the miro to the case of a generic disorder potential is highly desirable .",
    "here we present a comprehensive analysis of the photoresponse , taking into account all four contributions to the miro@xcite and using a generic - disorder model which is characterized by an arbitrary dependence of the elastic scattering rate [ tt ] _ ^-1=_n=-^_n^-1 e^in,_n=_-n on the scattering angle @xmath11 .",
    "we analyze the obtained results for a realistic model of mixed disorder formed by superposition of a smooth random potential and short - range scatterers .",
    "the theory allows one to identify the temperature range where a specific mechanism dominates the photoresponse for different types of disorder .",

    "@xmath175 the diagonal symmetric part @xmath58 of the phoconductivity has different temperature dependence in three temperature intervals separated by @xmath168 and @xmath172 .",
    "for @xmath176 the inelastic mechanism is dominant and , as a result , @xmath177 . in the interval @xmath178 ,",
    "the inelastic contribution becomes smaller than the displacement contribution leading to a temperature independent magnetoresistance @xmath179 .",
    "finally , for @xmath180 all the contributions are suppressed exponentially , see eq .   and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "clearly , the @xmath126independent interval does nt exist when @xmath172 is of order or smaller than @xmath168 .",
    "this situation was probably realized in the recent experiment.@xcite .",
    "the photoresponse is then expected to cross over from the inverse quadratic dependence @xmath181 for @xmath182 to a much faster exponential decay for @xmath180 . in this case , it is difficult to separate the displacement and inelastic contributions using the temperature dependence of the miro only , since in the region where the two contributions have comparable magnitudes , their temperature dependence is almost identical ( see fig .  [",
    "therefore , for @xmath183 some additional measurements aimed at determination of , for instance , the anisotropic diagonal component @xmath59 of the photoconductivity are desirable . since @xmath59 , eq .  ,",
    "is produced solely by the displacement mechanism ( the photovoltaic diagonal contributions @xmath184 and @xmath185 are negligible for @xmath165 ) , such a measurement would be a reliable tool to estimate the significance of the displacement mechanism at a given temperature . alternatively , for a fixed polarization of the microwaves , one can analyze the photoresponse in the vicinity of `` odd nodes '' @xmath186 , where the displacement contribution is non - zero , @xmath187 , while the inelastic contribution @xmath188 vanishes .",
    "in conclusion , we studied the microwave - induced magnetooscillations ( miro ) in the conductivity of a 2d electron gas with mixed disorder containing both a long - range random potential and short - range scatterers .",
    "we calculated all contributions to the current that are linear in the applied dc electric field and quadratic in the microwave field .",
    "it is found that the relation between different contributions strongly depends on the strength of wide - angle scattering off disorder and the sample temperature . in general , the microwave radiation modifies both the diagonal and off - diagonal components of the conductivity tensor , including the hall component .",
    "study of anisotropy of the current may identify each contribution separately .",
    "the dominant contribution at low temperatures is the inelastic contribution , which is always diagonal and isotropic . at higher temperatures and in the presence of wide - angle scattering ,",
    "the displacement mechanism may become larger than the inelastic contribution . at high temperatures the quantum corrections to the conductivity",
    "are exponentially suppressed by the electron - electron interaction .",
    "we believe that the possibility of measuring two types of nonequilibrium magnetooscillations ",
    "the miro and the hiro  in the same sample has opened new avenues for the characterization of 2d electron systems . in particular , measuring both of them could unambiguously reveal the two - scale structure of disorder characteristic of high - mobility samples . indeed , the relative weights of the smooth component of disorder ( produced by remote impurities separated from the electron gas by a wide spacer ) and the short - range component ( produced by residual impurities sitting near or at the interface ) manifest themselves differently in the various relaxation times that could be extracted from the experimental data .",
    "as we have demonstrated in this paper , the miro are sensitive to the correlation properties of disorder .",
    "specifically , their amplitude and shape are parametrized by the inelastic relaxation time and the disorder - induced relaxation times for the zeroth , first , and second angular harmonics of the electron distribution function , with the displacement contribution to the miro  strongly enhanced in the presence of short - range disorder  being parametrized by the time @xmath189 . therefore ,",
    "in addition to the routinely measured @xmath190@xcite and @xmath107 , one can : ( i ) extract the time @xmath108 from the exponential dependence of the amplitude of the oscillations on @xmath12 , both the miro and the hiro ; ( ii ) extract the time @xmath189 from the @xmath126 and @xmath191 dependences of the miro , as well as from the amplitude of the hiro .",
    "as for the inelastic time , it can be extracted in a variety of ways : from the power - law @xmath126 dependence of the miro amplitude at lower @xmath126 , from the miro and/or hiro exponential behavior as a function of @xmath126 at higher @xmath126 , as well as from the behavior of the nonlinear dc resistance as a function of the applied dc electric field.@xcite importantly , the inelastic and displacement contributions to the miro can then be unambiguously separated from each other .",
    "one interesting possibility worthy of experimental investigation is to extract all the relevant parameters in the absence of microwaves and use them to describe the experimental data on the miro without any free parameters .",
