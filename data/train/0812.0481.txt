    "it is important for our purpose that our operations should be functions and not only additive functions , the reason being that additive operations will appear to be trivial in some sense ( see section 3.5 ) . in these notes , we determine all operations @xmath19 over any field @xmath2 , no matter if @xmath20 or not .",
