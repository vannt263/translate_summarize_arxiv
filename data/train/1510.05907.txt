    "the three - meson vertex are important quantities in the phenomenological theories of hadron physics .",
    "knowledge of the mesons coupling constants or form factors plays important role to understand mesons interactions , meson decays , structure of the exotic mesons and so on .",
    "the form factors depend on the momentum as @xmath6 and some input parameters . in the last years meson form factors @xmath7@xcite , @xmath8@xcite , @xmath9@xcite , @xmath10@xcite , @xmath11@xcite , @xmath12@xcite , @xmath13@xcite , @xmath14@xcite and other vertices",
    "widely discussed in the literature ( for detailed information see @xcite and @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "many new heavy meson states have been observed and investigated in the recent years .",
    "the investigation of strong interaction of heavy hadrons among themselves has received increasing attention and this situation motivates us to investigate bottom mesons interactions .",
    "on the other hand , beginning from the cern - sps data analyses of heavy - ion collisions , quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase has taken many physicists attention .",
    "coming to this day , new experimental results pointing a qgp phase in p - pb collisions at the lhc have been announced @xcite .",
    "the understanding of thermal meson properties before phase transition requires to study the temperature dependencies of meson form factors .",
    "the knowledge on temperature dependence of form factors is very important for interpretation of heavy - ion collision experiments and understanding qcd vacuum .",
    "for instance , comparing to its value in vacuum , we see that the value of the form factor decreases suddenly around the deconfinement temperature .",
    "we consider this as a sign of a possible phase transition .",
    "the aim of extending sum rules to finite temperature is to understand thermal properties of hadrons . because understanding thermal properties of qcd vacuum allows us to clarify properties of observable universe .",
    "moreover , theoretical studies on qcd at finite temperature is necessary to explain the experimental results obtained from the heavy ion collisions .",
    "it is assumed that the increase of density and temperature of media where the hadrons are formed rearrange physical properties of hadrons such as decay widths and masses .",
    "also , it is known that heavy mesons have different behaviours when temperature of the medium increases ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these motivated us to investigate thermal properties of mesons .",
    "form factors at vertices of three heavy mesons at low energies are not be able to calculate using perturbative approaches .",
    "the qcd sum rules method is one of the most effective tools considering non - perturbative nature of hadronic properties @xcite , since it does not have any model - dependencies .",
    "the extending of qcd sum rules method to finite temperature has been made in the paper @xcite .",
    "this extension based on two basic assumptions , that the operator product expansion ( ope ) and notion of quark - hadron duality remains valid at finite temperature , but the vacuum condensates must be replaced by their thermal expectation values @xcite . the thermal qcd sum rules approach has been extensively used for studying masses and decay constants of both light and heavy mesons as a reliable and well - established method @xcite .",
    "but , in the literature , there are few theoretical works devoted to the analysis of the hadron vertex form factors at finite temperature .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate strong form factor @xmath15 vertex in the framework of the qcd sum rules method at finite temperature .",
    "the key concepts of the strong form factor calculations in sum rules are three - point correlation functions . in order to calculate form factors",
    ", one must have the temperature dependencies of masses and decay constants of the hadrons in the vertex .",
    "since we aim to extend strong form factors to finite temperatures , in this study , we choose mesons whose masses and leptonic decay constants have been investigated in thermal qcd sum rules approach @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in the next section , the qcd sum rules for the form factors of the related mesons are obtained in the framework of the qcd sum rules at finite temperature . in section iii ,",
    "our numerical predictions for the strong coupling constant and comparison of the results with the existing predictions of the other studies are presented .",
    "in this section , we obtain the sum rules for the strong form factor of @xmath16 vertex in the qcd sum rules framework at finite temperature .",

    "the correlation function is calculated in two different ways : first , in the hadronic language which is called as physical side ; and second , by using the qcd terms which is called ope side . after equating these two different representations of correlation functions ,",
    "we acquire the qcd sum rules for the strong form factors . in order to suppress the higher state contributions and continuum contributions we apply a double borel transformation with respect to the variables @xmath26 and @xmath27 to physical side and ope side .    in the phenomenological side , a complete set of intermediate states with the same quantum numbers with current @xmath28",

    "moreover , we chose @xmath41 as the structure and write the terms which are proportional to @xmath41 . concluding , by using dispersion integral representation , the equation above can be written as : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is called the spectral density . to obtain the spectral density , the feynman diagram in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) which is called the bare loop diagram",
