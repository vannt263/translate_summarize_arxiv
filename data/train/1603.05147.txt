    "nonequilibrium statistical mechanics wants to find explanations of irreversible phenomena in the combination of fluctuation theory with mechanics .",
    "there are a great many of such nonequilibria , and it is probably naive to think there is a simple unique framework . that in contrast with equilibrium where the gibbs formalism provides such a frame and the thermodynamic potentials preside over all considerations . that is made possible by the existence of entropy in the sense of clausius , a state function of the equilibrium system whose differential gives the reversible heat over temperature in the reservoir .",
    "that entropy is not only related to heat .",
    "an extension of it as given by boltzmann also governs the macroscopic static fluctuations and it gives an h - functional for the return towards equilibrium .",
    "in fact , the relaxation of macroscopic quantities follows gradient flow in a thermodynamic landscape .",
    "similarly , linear response around equilibrium is related to that same entropy in the fluctuation ",
    "dissipation theorem , where the ( green-)kubo formulae universally correlate the observable under investigation with the excess in entropy flux as caused by the perturbation . and of course , statistical forces are gradients of thermodynamic potentials with the entropic force being the prime example of the power of numbers .",
    "+ for nonequilibrium it is rather conservative to believe that extensions involving only notions such as time anti - symmetric currents and entropy production , even trajectory dependent and fluctuating , would suffice to describe the physics .",
    "it is not because stationary dissipation is almost equivalent with steady nonequilibrium , or that dissipation is ubiquitous in complex phenomena that all nonequilibrium properties would be _ determined _ by the time - antisymmetric fluctuation sector or by energy ",
    "entropy considerations , or that typical nonequilibrium features would be uniquely _ caused _ by dissipative aspects . that is not very surprising , but",
    "still it may be useful to get simple reminders of the role of time - symmetric and kinetic aspects in the construction of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "the plan of this note is then to list a number of non - dissipative aspects , summarized in what we call the frenetic contribution and secondly , to discuss the measurability of that .",
    "+ since this is part of a general course on complexity , we have avoided complications and the examples are kept very simple .",
    "the level of exposition is introductory .",
    "yet , the material or the concepts are quite new compared to the traditional line of extending standard thermodynamics to the irreversible domain @xcite .",
    "transport is usefully characterized in terms of response coefficients such as conductivities .",
    "we discuss them in section [ reps ] , while here we deal with the question of what determines the direction of the current and how it could decrease by pushing harder .",
    "consider the metal rod in fig .",
    "[ hecs ] which is connected at its ends with a hot and a cold thermal bath .",
    "the environment exchanges energy with the system but at different temperatures for the two ends of the rod .        in that case",
    "we can , on the appropriate scale of time , think of the system as being in steady nonequilibrium .",
    "it is stationary alright , not changing its macroscopic appearance , but a current is maintained through it . therefore the system is not in equilibrium .",
    "in fact there is a constant production @xmath0 of entropy in the environment , in the sense that energy is dissipated in the two thermal baths .",
    "we apply the usual formula @xmath1 with @xmath2 the energy flux into the @xmath3th bath at temperature @xmath4 .",
    "stationarity ( conservation of energy ) implies that @xmath5 so that we can find the direction of the energy current @xmath6 by requiring @xmath7    similar scenario s can be written for chemical and mechanical baths that frustrate the system .",
    "those are typical examples where , to find the direction of the current , we can apply the second law stating that the stationary entropy production be positive . + it is however not uncommon in nonequilibrium to find a system where the direction of the current is essentially not decided by the entropy production .",
    "we could have various cycles in the system , and depending on the cycle a particular current would go one way or the other , and yet both directions show exactly the same entropy production .",

    "[ traj ] .",
    "we see there the trajectories of particles being pushed to the right , while joule heating the environment .",
    "we imagine periodic boundary conditions so that the constant external field is rotational ( and hence can not be derived from a potential , which causes the breaking of detailed balance ) .",
    "there are hooks on the floor and at the ceiling of the tube what are obstacles for the particles motion .",
    "suppose we want to relate that situation to a random walk ; what would we choose for @xmath42 and @xmath43 ?",
    "the external field delivers a certain work @xmath44 per unit time to each particle , which is dissipated in the environment at inverse temperature @xmath45 .",
    "locally , we can take the system to obey detailed balance and thus we require @xmath46 that does not quite determine the rates @xmath47 . what appears important here",
    "also is to know how the escape rates depend on @xmath44 ; that is the dependence @xmath48 from the situation in fig .",
    "[ traj ] it is clear that a large driving field or what amounts to the same thing , large @xmath44 , causes trapping . the particles are being pushed against the hooks , or caught and have much difficulty in escaping from the trap as they are constantly pushed back on them .",
    "hence the escape rates and the function @xmath49 will be decreasing in @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , we can expect that here @xmath50 ; see @xcite .",
    "+ let us see what that means for the current ; the random walker has a current @xmath51 we clearly see that for large @xmath44 , in fact basically outside the linear regime in @xmath44 , the current becomes decreasing in @xmath44 ( whenever @xmath49 is decreasing in @xmath44 ) ; the more you push the more the particles get trapped and the current goes down ; see also @xcite + the above mechanism , described here in the simplest possible terms , is an instance of negative differential conductivity , the current showing a negative derivative with respect to the driving field .",
    "it is physically interesting and also very important , but for us it suffices to remark that the effect is clearly non - dissipative .",
    "of course one needs a current in the first place but what happens with it is related to time - symmetric fluctuations , here in the form of waiting time distributions .",
    "the dynamical activity is a function of @xmath44 and can not be ignored , and is even essential in the understanding of the effect of negative differential conductivities .",
    "we have a general response ",
    "approach to that effect coming up in section [ reps ] ; see . + as a final remark , the trapping effect in the above is trivially caused by the geometry .",
    "there are other mechanisms like in the lorentz gas where the obstacles are random placed or even moving slightly , @xcite .",
    "but we can also imagine that that trapping and caging is not caused by external placements but by the interaction itself between the driven particles .",
    "in that case we speak about jamming and glass transitions @xcite , or even about many body localization @xcite .",
    "static fluctuations refer to the occurrence of single time events that are not typical for an existing condition . for example",
    ", in this room there is a certain air density which is quite homogeneous and as a result we have a constant index of refraction of light etc .",
    "that is typical for the present equilibrium condition here for air at room temperature and at atmospheric pressure . yet",
    ", there are fluctuations , meaning little regions where the density locally deviates .",
    "we can expect these regions to be very small ; otherwise we would have noticed before . that is why such fluctuations are called _ large _ deviations",
    "; they are very unlikely when they take macroscopic proportions and they are exponentially small in the volume of the fluctuation . the rate of fluctuations , i.e. , what multiplies that volume , is given by the appropriate free energy difference ( at least in equilibrium ) ; for the local air density we would have the grand canonical potential .",
    "similarly , the energy @xmath52 in a subvolume @xmath53 fluctuates .",
    "the total energy is conserved in an isolated system , but there will be exchanges through the boundary ; see fig .",
    ". it could be that the particle number @xmath54 is also fixed inside @xmath53 , in which case the fluctuations are governed by the helmholtz free energy @xmath55 , in the following sense .",
    "when the system is in thermal equilibrium and away from phase coexistence regimes the local fluctuations of the energy density @xmath56 satisfy the asymptotic law @xmath57 \\simeq \\exp-\\beta v[\\cal f(e)-{\\cal f}_\\text{eq}]\\ ] ] where the variational functional is @xmath58 with @xmath59 being the entropy density at that energy density @xmath60 , and @xmath61 being the equilibrium free energy density at temperature @xmath20 ( and @xmath62 ) .",
    "it is only a slight variation to ask for the probability of profiles , i.e. , to estimate the plausibility of given spatial variations of a particular quantity .",
    "we then need spatially extended systems , most interestingly with interacting components .",
    "clearly the precise formulae will be difficult to get analytically , but we can turn to some model systems of interacting particles to get a good idea of what can happen .",
    "one example is the symmetric exclusion process driven via open boundaries at the edges of a one - dimensional interval . in the macroscopic limit ,",
    "the stationary profile fluctuations are derived in @xcite .",
    "+ in general , the fluctuation functions , describing the macroscopic static fluctuations are called boltzmann entropies or also just , free energies in two directions .",

    "there are other ways to set up static fluctuations .",
    "the easiest is of course to take independent particles and to ask for the probability that a fraction of the independent copies resides in some given configuration .",
    "that is the first thing we mean when considering the stationary distribution of some markov process ; probabilities refer to imagining independent copies of the same small system which is subject to fluctuations by external influences . to be specific consider again the driven exclusion process as above but now for only two sites , very far from the diffusive hydrodynamic regime .",

    "the excess dynamical activity is essentially minus the change in escape rate @xmath172 times the number of jumps .",

    "we restrict us here also to the case where the perturbation is time - independent ( after the initial time ) .",
    "+ furthermore we assume that the perturbation enters at most linearly in @xmath59 , i.e. , higher derivatives like @xmath175 are zero ; it means that the hamiltonian is linear in the perturbing field .",

    "the result that extends is @xmath176 where the primes refer to @xmath177derivatives at @xmath119 .",

    "we have global detailed balance and no stationary current when @xmath190 .",
    "then , the environment is thermodynamically specified by the chemical potential @xmath179 and inverse temperature @xmath45 via @xmath191 yet , just as for our random walker above , the jump rates @xmath192 and @xmath193 are not completely specified by @xmath194 ; the coupling with the environment indeed depends on more kinetic elements .",

    "the linear order response is exactly the same for the two types of perturbations , indistinguishable because that is purely dissipative .",
    "the historically first big problem of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics is to characterize the relaxation to equilibrium and to establish its dynamical stability .",
    "the main part of the history of nonequilibrium physics since boltzmann s time has been devoted to that question and still today these efforts very much continue for example in derivations of diffusion equations .",
    "it is understandable that entropy differences , hence dissipative effects , play a role there .",
    "we start by recalling the heuristic picture .",
    "equilibrium is characterized first for closed isolated and macroscopic systems .",
    "consider a physical partition of the classical phase space at fixed energy @xmath210 , volume @xmath53 and particle number @xmath54 .",
    "we have in mind to coarse grain fast degrees of freedom or to follow profiles of globally conserved quantities .",
    "abstractly , there is a many - to - one map @xmath211 from the phase space point @xmath212 , collecting all the positions and momenta of the many particles all equally plausible when compatible with @xmath213 , to the set of macroscopic values @xmath214 such as for the ( kinetic ) energy and density profiles or for other macroscopic quantities .",
    "since these macroscopic observables involve a huge amount of particles , with arithmetic averages over space or over particles , we can apply the law of large numbers with respect to the liouville measure to say that there exist typical values for @xmath214 , that one should meet and see in other words with overwhelming probability upon randomly picking a point @xmath212 in the constant @xmath215phase space .",
    "these are the equilibrium values @xmath216 and the phase space region where they are realized is called the equilibrium ( condition ) .",
    "the entropy (  la boltzmann ) is the log of the phase space region for a macroscopic condition and hence equilibrium is the condition of maximum entropy ; cf .",
    "+        it may seem that we have not used at all the dynamics , and in particular equilibrium got no dynamical characterization .",
    "that is not entirely true .",
    "first , we specified @xmath217 which , especially through fixing the value @xmath210 of the energy , of course depends on the interactions of the particles .",
    "secondly we made a choice of macroscopic variables .",
    "it should be clear that not all choices are very interesting or even reasonable .",
    "also there we can expect dependencies on the interaction and specifications of the time - evolution .",
    "for example , we would hope that the macroscopic variables will jointly give rise to an autonomous dynamics on the macroscopic ( thermodynamic or hydrodynamic ) level of description .",
    "that again depends on the microscopic dynamics .",
    "but of course , dynamics will matter essentially in the relaxation towards equilibrium ; how trajectories starting in a region / condition of small volume / entropy would typically reach equilibrium . a still often claimed condition is that of ergodicity .",
    "the latter is essentially a postulate on the dynamics ( only ) and hence can not in fact be very relevant to the question of relaxation to equilibrium .",
    "indeed , the so called ergodicity postulate plays no big role in the foundations of statistical mechanics or in the elucidation of the zero - th law of thermodynamics ; equilibrium and the return to equilibrium is not only a dynamical question .",
    "ergodicity is there neither sufficient nor necessary . yet , the notion of dynamical activity which is a statistical mechanical one and the absence of kinetic constraints , comes close to the heuristics traditionally associated to ergodicity when emphasizing the possibility of the system to `` explore '' the phase space .",
    "so it is probably a good suggestion to keep the intuition behind ergodicity and mixing conditions but to apply them on the physical coarse - grained or reduced level of description and to think rather about the absence of kinetic constraints and the necessity of having dynamical activity to escape from nonequilibrium regions of phase space . + concerning the main point of these lectures indeed",
    ", it should be clear that non - dissipative aspects should play a role also .",
    "especially when starting well away from equilibrium , visiting phase space regions with smaller volume , it appears not unreasonable to imagine that also `` surface '' effects and not only volume effects will contribute to determine the pathways to equilibrium .",
    "the exit and entrance rates from a macroscopic condition are not determined by its volume ( entropy ) solely .",
    "that is the first heuristics behind suspecting that time - symmetric quantities , like time - symmetric currents , will also appear essentially outside equilibrium .",
    "in fact , on the same level of discussion we can easily imagine that the interaction between various components lead to effective kinetic constraints such that the relaxation becomes very difficult . that `` breaking of ergodicity '' is studied in various models and sometimes is referred to as glassy behavior or as many body localization @xcite .",
    "the kinetic constraints are basically involving non - dissipative aspects , having to do with trapping and caging effects in phase space , which is just an abstraction of what happens in fig .",
    "[ traj ] ( replacing there the external field by thermodynamic forces and replacing the obstacles by either disorder in the interaction or by specific many body effects ) .",
    "the question arises how non - dissipative aspects can be isolated and/or measured .",
    "is there something like measuring excesses in dynamical activity , as we encounter for example in the frenetic contribution to response functions ?",
    "let us first see what that means for thermodynamic potentials .",
    "+ entropy is of course not directly measured  it is obtained via measurements of heat capacity or from heat measurements .",
    "similarly , free energies are measured from work , as we remember from the following type of calculation .",
    "suppose that the states @xmath218 of a system are coupled to some real variable @xmath43 , say the position of a probe , via the interaction energies @xmath219 .",
    "the mechanical force on @xmath43 is @xmath220 . for a quasi - static probe",
    "we can take the statistical average over the equilibrium distribution , @xmath221 in other words , the statistical force is gradient with potential given by the free energy ( now depending on @xmath43 ) .",
    "it is then clear how reversible transformations will have changes in free energy given by the work done on the probe .",
    "+ the idea for measuring non - dissipative aspects can proceed similarly .",
    "+ in general we have that statistical forces out - of - equilibrium are given by @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the stationary distribution of a nonequilibrium medium which is coupled via interaction energy @xmath219 to a quasi - static probe .",
    "clearly , as we have seen throughout these notes , the distribution @xmath223 will contain non - dissipative aspects .",
    "therefore , measuring the work done by the statistical force @xmath224 on a probe will reveal aspects of dynamical activity , changes in escape rates or in time - symmetric parts of reactivities .",
    "that is the general idea , but of course we need to implement it in specific situations .",
    "paradoxically , as the system dissipates more , more non - dissipative features become visible .",
    "look again at the situation depicted in fig .",
    "+ suppose you would like to measure the dependence of the escape rate @xmath225 on the external driving field .",
    "what we will do is to couple the walker to a probe with position @xmath43 for example as a load connected to the walker via a spring , @xmath226 the stationary distribution of the driven particles for high field @xmath44 can be approximated by dividing an elementary interval length @xmath180 , say between two major obstacles , in three different states , one for the walker being directly behind the obstacle , another for being in the middle of the interval and yet a third state for being in front of an obstacle ; see fig .  [ traj ] .",
    "we then write @xmath227 , independent of probe position @xmath43 for very small @xmath228 .",
    "that is similar to what we saw already in fig .",
    "[ 3st ] , how the reactivities determine the stationary distribution .",
    "the statistical force on the probe ( load ) is then approximated by @xmath229 telling us about the escape rate @xmath225 .",
    "when we find the position of the probe where the statistical force is zero , @xmath230 , we will get information about the escape rate profile .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath231 $ ] , then the stationary position of the probe will be at @xmath232 for large @xmath44 , from which we would find the slope coefficient @xmath233 .",
    "the probe will find itself in a harmonic well for effective potential @xmath234 .",
    "another tool to derive information about non - dissipative aspects of a nonequilibrium medium is to look at the rotational part in the statistical force induced on a probe .",
    "in fact , the very presence of a rotational component to the statistical force is produced by the simultaneous appearance of excess entropy flux and excess dynamical activity when the medium relaxes to a new stationary condition after displacing the probe .",
    "+ the simplest example of how the statistical force can pick up the dependence of reactivities on the driving goes as follows ; see also @xcite .",
    "+ we follow a probe on the unit circle , @xmath235 , in contact with a thermal bath at inverse temperature @xmath77 , modeled via the overdamped langevin dynamics @xmath236 for @xmath237 standard white noise , @xmath238 is the damping coefficient and there is an interaction with an ` internal ' degree of freedom @xmath239 with potential @xmath240 the @xmath218 is the fast degree of freedom , driven with transition rates @xmath208[aa ] k^q(x , x)= e^-2 [ e(x,q)-e(x , q ) ] ( x , x ) e^ s(x , x ) the drive is uniform , with @xmath241 but we assume that also the symmetric @xmath242 are affected via @xmath243 for some @xmath244 , while @xmath245 .",
    "detailed balance is achieved at @xmath246 , where @xmath247 picks up the relative importance of the dynamical activity over the transitions @xmath248 .",
    "the statistical force on the probe is @xmath249 and can be calculated exactly .",
    "the rotational part of the force @xmath250 is plotted versus @xmath120 in fig .",
    "[ rotf](a ) .",
    "observe that the rotational force depends on the coefficient @xmath233 , and hence picks up information about that non - dissipative part @xmath251 in the reaction rates .",
    "in fact , we see clearly , take @xmath252 , that the rotational force is maximal for an intermediate @xmath253 . for larger @xmath244",
    "we get less rotational force on the probe , because the medium gets more jammed , in fact similarly again to what happens in fig .",
    "[ 3st](b ) for large @xmath99 . +     of the statistical force on the probe and how it depends on the excess in time - symmetric reactivities for intermediate values of @xmath120 only .",
    "( b ) the current in the driven three - state process rescaled by @xmath254.,width=529 ]    fig .",
    "[ rotf](b ) , where we see the current in the medium process , must be compared with fig .",
    "[ rotf](a ) : there is no simple relation between the rotational power in the probe and the entropy production in the medium .",
    "we finally come to a major influence of non - dissipative aspects on nonequilibrium structures . to put it in contradictory terms and in line with the recent @xcite :",
    "purely dissipative trajectory ensembles are wrong because they do not allow dissipation . by a purely dissipative trajectory ensemble we mean a probability distribution on trajectories , as in section [ reps ] , where however the action with respect to equilibrium only contains the entropy flux . in other words , looking back at and",
    ", we would have an action @xmath255 proportional to the entropy flux only , thus forgetting about the frenetic contribution @xmath19 .",
    "such ensembles are often considered for modeling nonequilibrium in the spirit of maximum entropy or maximum caliber assumptions .",
    "the point is that these mutilated ensembles @xmath256 \\propto \\text{prob}_\\text{eq}[\\omega]\\,e^{\\lambda s(\\omega)}\\ ] ] often have additional symmetries which are unwanted .",
    "the main mathematical consequence of is that under time - reversal @xmath137 ( defined in section [ path ] ) , @xmath257",
    "\\propto \\text{prob}_\\text{eq}[\\omega]\\,e^{-\\lambda s(\\omega)}\\ ] ] while there may be other involutions @xmath258 leaving invariant the equilibrium ensemble for which @xmath259 and hence , for the mutilated ensemble , @xmath260 = \\text{prob}[\\omega]\\ ] ] ( see equation ( 12 ) in @xcite or equations ( 6)(9 ) in @xcite ) . indeed , it is easy to imagine for example how spatial reflection inverts @xmath59 in exactly the same way as does time - reversal ( and leaving the equilibrium reference invariant ) .",
    "it implies that we could exchange time - reversal with spatial reflection , or more generally that we could induce time - reversal by reversing the thermodynamic forces .",
    "then , the dynamical ensemble of a diffusion driven by some non - conservative field @xmath261 would have a time - reversal which is obtained by simply flipping @xmath262 .",
    "now , since the stationary ( single time ) distribution of the process is identical to the stationary distribution of the time - reversed process , we would have that the stationary distribution is left invariant by flipping the field @xmath262 , which of course is often very wrong . but even forgetting about that last point , all expectations of time - symmetric observables would be invariant under @xmath262 , @xmath263 when @xmath264 , and all expectations of time - antisymmetric observables would be antisymmetric under @xmath262 , @xmath265 when @xmath266 .",
    "for example , from the last equality , for an energy current @xmath149 we would have @xmath267 but often @xmath268 so that we would need to conclude that @xmath269 , no dissipation ! + in other words , such nonequilibrium ensemble , lacking non - dissipative terms in the action , would not be able to break certain symmetries .",
    "that point was first stressed in the theory of @xcite . also an example was given there of a viscous fluid under influence of a pressure difference in some tube . in the laminar flow regime (",
    "left part of fig .",
    "[ summ ] ) we indeed can not distinguish between reversal of time and reversal of pressure difference . yet , at higher pressure differences ( right part of fig .",
    "[ summ ] ) , when things get really nonequilibrium , the laminar pattern breaks up , the flow becomes turbulent and time - reversal definitely differs from field - reversal . another and older example where such symmetry breaking is essential is found in @xcite .",
    "there a turbulent boundary layer flow is considered over a smooth symmetric hump ; see fig .",
    "[ summ ] .    .",
    "left : for small driving we get a laminar flow without symmetry breaking .",
    "time - reversal equals field reversal .",
    "right : for appreciable field strength turbulent flow develops and the spatial symmetry gets broken essentially by the non - dissipative frenetic contribution in the action , which is absent in the ensemble .,width=529 ]    for the ensemble there would never be a possibility to break that symmetry . yet , true nonequilibrium does create a weak symmetry breaking , indeed visible for aeolian sand transport and dune formation .",
    "note still that the ensemble is compatible with the kubo formula and linear response around equilibrium , exactly for the ( same ) reasons that lead to and .",
    "moreover , so called fluctuation symmetries @xcite are trivially true . yet",
