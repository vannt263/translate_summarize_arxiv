    "strongly correlated quantum systems exhibit a wide range of exciting and unconventional physical phenomena . one such effect which has recently received much attention due to its exotic properties are topological spin liquids , which  despite strong antiferromagnetic interactions  do not order magnetically even at very low temperatures due to the presence of strong quantum fluctuations ; at the same time , these systems order topologically , which gives e.g.  rise to fractionalized excitations with anyonic statistics .",
    "@xcite it is believed that such phases are realized in materials such as herbertsmithite , which show no sign of magnetic ordering down to very low temperatures,@xcite and where indeed recently signatures of fractionalized excitations have been experimentally observed .",
    "@xcite    from a theoretical point of view , a prime candidate model for a topological quantum spin liquid is the heisenberg antiferromagnet ( hafm ) on the kagome lattice , which is believed to provide a good approximation of the physics of herbertsmithite .",
    "understanding the low - temperature phase diagram of the kagome hafm has proven notoriously difficult , with several different phases competing with each other ; the currently most convincing data , obtained using dmrg ,  @xcite suggests that the ground state of the kagome hafm is a gapped @xmath0 topological spin liquid , i.e. , a spin liquid with a @xmath2 correction to the topological entropy .",
    "given the hardness of understanding the exact ground state of the kagome hafm , in order to obtain a qualitative understanding of the physics of the kagome hafm , variational wavefunctions have been considered which are constructed to capture the physics of the antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "resonating valence bond ( rvb ) states have been proposed as an ansatz for antiferromagnets ,  @xcite and have helped to understand the spin liquid nature of antiferromagnets e.g.  on the square or kagome lattice ; in particular , it has been found that the kagome rvb state is a @xmath1 topological spin liquid in the phase of the toric code model .",
    "@xcite combining this with the observation of @xmath1 topological order in the aforementioned numerical simulations , this suggests that the kagome hafm is a spin liquid in the same phase as the toric code .",
    "however , there is a another topological phase with a topological entropy @xmath2 , corresponding to the so - called double semion model ; and while these two phases can in principle be distinguished by their quasi - particle excitations , this has up to now not been achieved in dmrg calculations .    in this paper",
    ", we apply variational wavefunctions to better understand the topological nature of the kagome hafm . to this end",
    ", we introduce _ semionic rvb states",
    "_ , this is , rvb states which are in the phase of the double semion model , and investigate their properties and their suitability as a variational ansatz for the kagome hafm .",
    "we show that semionic rvb states are in the same phase as the double semion model , and that they do not exhibit magnetic ordering . while the energy of the semionic rvb as an ansatz for the kagome hafm is not competitive with the conventional rvb",
    ", we find that a two - parameter generalization termed _ semionic simplex rvb _ has a variational energy which is even below the energy of the analogous family of conventional simplex rvb states .",
    "we then proceed to study the entanglement properties of the semionic rvb state , and find that its entanglement spectrum exhibits features which are clearly distinct from the entanglement spectrum of the conventional rvb state ( in particular , the minimum in the dispersion is at different momentum ) , and which therefore might be useful to discriminate the two @xmath1 topological phases e.g.  in dmrg simulations .",
    "an interesting property of our wavefunction is that it explicitly breaks translational symmetry .",
    "while this might be an artefact of the construction , we find evidence that symmetry breaking is in fact energetically favorable , and we discuss possible consequences for the ground state of the kagome hafm .    a central tool in our investigation",
    "are projected entangled pair states ( peps ) .",
    "peps allow for an exact description of a variety of states , in particular renormalization fixed points of topological phases ,  @xcite but also resonating valence bond states ,  @xcite where they have allowed for both analytical and high - precision numerical study of their properties .",
    "@xcite by combining elements of the peps constructions for the double semion model and the rvb state , we obtain a peps description of semionic rvb states , which we subsequently apply to study their physics .",

    "the latter is the ground state of the seminal toric code model by kitaev , which has @xmath1 topological order .",
    "@xcite given a suitable local encoding of @xmath8 , this mapping corresponds to a constant - depth unitary local circuit , and thus , the kagome dimer model is in the same phase as the toric code .",

    "as we will see , this gives rise to symmetry breaking in the semionic dimer and rvb model , while this is not the case for the conventional dimer / rvb state .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that changing the reference configuration corresponds to flipping a certain loop pattern : while this is a @xmath25-to-@xmath25 mapping on the set of all loop configurations and thus does not affect the conventional dimer and rvb model , it changes the number of loops and thus the phases in the semionic wavefunctions .",
