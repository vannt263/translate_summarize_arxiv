    "we conclude this letter with a discussion of the results and their implications ( @xmath8 [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "the capmap instrument is described in detail in @xcite ; here its most important features are given . in the winter of 2003 , four w - band ( 84@xmath9100 ghz ) polarimeters ( a@xmath9d ) were installed in the focal plane of the 7  m cassegrain antenna @xcite at the lucent technologies facility in crawford hill , new jersey ( w@xmath10 , n@xmath11 ) .",
    "the horn and meniscus lens system attached to each polarimeter underilluminated the telescope mirrors with an edge taper of @xmath12  db on the primary , resulting in a final beam of @xmath13 fwhm ( @xmath14 ) with an ellipticity less than 3@xmath4 .",
    "the polarimeters were housed inside a single cryostat , nominally arranged so that a ( c ) observed @xmath15 below ( above ) and b ( d ) @xmath15 left ( right ) of the optical axis of the telescope .",
    "heterodyne analog correlation polarimeters that multiply two orthogonal components of the incident electric field produced an output proportional to one linear combination of the stokes parameters _ q _ and _ u_. the two components derive from an ortho - mode transducer ( omt ) oriented with one axis horizontal .",
    "the polarimeter output is thus proportional to the difference in power for field components aligned @xmath16 to the horizontal in the focal plane .",
    "the first - stage low noise amplifiers ( lnas ) in each arm are inp hemt monolithic microwave - integrated circuits developed by jpl and northrop grumman space technology @xcite .",
    "a mechanical refrigerator cools the horns , the omt , and the lnas to @xmath1740 k. one local oscillator inside the cryostat supplies the polarimeters with the 82  ghz to down - convert the 84@xmath9100  ghz signals to an intermediate frequency ( if ) of 2@xmath918  ghz .",
    "the oscillator signal in one arm of each polarimeter is phase - switched at 4  khz , well above the @xmath18 knee of the amplifiers .",
    "a detector diode monitors the total power in each arm .",
    "the phase - switched if radiation is split into three 4  ghz - wide subbands ( s0 , s1 , s2 ) prior to multiplication , yielding then 12 polarization and eight total power channels .",
    "the polarimeter outputs are digitized ( 24  bits , 100  khz ) with a @xmath19 analog - to - digital converter ( ics-610 ) ; digitally demodulated data are recorded at 100  hz .",
    "the 100  khz samples , averaged over 40 phase switches , are recorded to produce quadrature data sets , demodulated out of phase with the phase switch , which contain no celestial signal .",
    "between 2003 february 18 and april 6 , 541 hr of cmb data were recorded .",
    "calibration data were taken before , regularly throughout , and after the season .",
    "for the cmb observation the telescope s optical axis moved through the north celestial pole ( ncp ) with an 8  s period by @xmath20 at constant elevation .",
    "polarimeter offsets from the optical axis are given in table [ tab : horns ] ; the sampled region is a circle of diameter @xmath21 centered on the ncp , with the inner circle of diameter @xmath22 missing .",

    "the clock correction ranged from 0.9 to 1 and varied by at most 0.003  hr@xmath26 .",
    "the calibration for two of the channels ( ds0 , ds2 ) was adjusted by @xmath27 to compensate for gain compression .",
    "the cmb data were divided into 40  s periods ; data within each were divided into 20 @xmath28-wide , nearly uniformly populated azimuthal bins , discarding the @xmath29 of the data at the turnarounds .",
    "means and standard errors calculated in each bin were carried forward in the analysis .",
    "varying the period between 16 and 40  s did not alter the final results .",
    "a second - order polynomial was fitted to the azimuthal samples in each 40  s period and removed .",
    "the polarimetry channels reject the common mode intensity by more than 23  db , but their residual sensitivity to the atmospheric temperature , which varied daily by 10  k , dominated the intercept terms .",
    "the linear terms were evident when co - added over an hour , revealing slopes as large as @xmath30k  deg@xmath26 , with variations up to @xmath31k  deg@xmath26day@xmath26 .",
    "the quadratic terms were even smaller and more stable .",
    "abnormally high fluctuations ( @xmath32 ) in the polarized channels or unusual changes in the ratios between different total power channels were observed for 20 hr of data .",
    "both symptoms result from ice formation on the cryostat windows so these data were removed .",
    "the five most sensitive total power channels were used to identify bad weather with a cut on their fractional deviations",
    ". only periods that passed the cut for all five channels were retained , eliminating 88 hr and leaving 433 hr for the final data sample .",
    "ten percent variations in this cut level changed the result within statistics .",
    "collapsing all polarization data into the 20 azimuthal bins reveals scan synchronous structures ( ssss ) with rms levels from 10 to 26  @xmath6k ; from a 90  ghz side lobe beam map , these are likely due to ground pickup . dependences on variables like system temperature , local sidereal time ( lst ) , or ambient temperature were studied . only bs1 and",
    "bs2 showed such a dependence , varying with the ambient temperature .",
    "the mean of the data in each azimuthal bin was removed , and residual effects that could arise from correlations to ambient temperature are modeled as described below . the channel with the largest structure and variation ( bs2 ) is dropped with negligible change in the results but with a significant reduction in the systematic uncertainty .",
    "after structure removal , corrections for atmospheric absorption ( typically 20@xmath4 ) derived from the total power channels , were applied .",
    "the corrected periods , already parsed into azimuth bins , were binned into 72 lst bins , yielding 72@xmath3320=1440 element data vectors for each of the 12 channels .",
    "the weighted averages of the three frequency channels ( which have correlations less than 1@xmath4 ) were used in the likelihood analysis .",
    "one resulting data vector is displayed in figure [ fig : map ] .",
    "a bayesian likelihood analysis was performed by maximizing the likelihood , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the data vector with @xmath36 entries and @xmath37 is the covariance matrix .",
    "the vector @xmath35 sums the signal ( @xmath38 ) and receiver noise ( @xmath39 ) terms : @xmath40 , where @xmath41 determines the linear combination of _ q _ ( @xmath42 ) and _ u _ ( @xmath43 ) in pixel @xmath44 .",
    "similarly , the covariance matrix comprises signal ( @xmath45 ) added to noise @xmath46 : @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , with typical noise @xmath49k .",
    "the signal covariance depends on the multipole moments for _ e_- and _ b_-modes , @xmath50 and @xmath51 : @xmath52 here , the window function matrices @xmath53 account for ( 1 ) beam functions @xmath54 ) , ( 2 ) the different pixel areas in the data vector , and ( 3 ) the conversion from ( _ q , u _ ) to @xmath55 @xcite . figure [ fig : result ] shows the trace of receiver c s _ e_-mode window function , similar to those of the other receivers . the likelihood is maximized with respect to one to three variables that parameterize @xmath56 and/or @xmath57 , as described below .    the signal - to - noise ratio eigenmode method was used ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : transformations into the basis where the noise matrix is white and then into the eigenbasis of the transformed @xmath45 are performed . removing offsets every 40  s and subtracting ssss transform @xmath35 to @xmath58 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath37 is transformed to @xmath59 , and the analysis is continued in the subspace onto which @xmath60 projects .    the code was exercised extensively with simulated data sets .",
    "realizations with noise levels from that of the data to 20 times smaller were superposed on cmb realizations of the concordance model @xcite .",
    "the likelihood estimator was found to be unbiased ; however , at the noise level of the data , the loss of sensitivity from the offset removals is a factor of 2 .",
    "four likelihood evaluations were made : first by taking @xmath56 as a multiplier of the concordance model , with @xmath61 ; second by taking @xmath62 to be a constant ( flat band - power ) , with @xmath61 ; third by simultaneously taking @xmath56 as a multiplier to the concordance model and @xmath63 as a constant ; and fourth by taking @xmath56 to comprise three flat band - power levels , in the @xmath64 bins ( 2 - 500/501 - 1500/1501 - 2900 ) , with @xmath65 ( three - band analysis ) .",
    "fit results are summarized in table [ tab : result1 ] .",
    "effective @xmath64s are calculated according to @xcite and quoted with the central 68@xmath4 region of @xmath66 .",
    "the various likelihood evaluations yield a 2  @xmath67 detection of the _ e_-mode signal , with no _ b_-mode signal or significant dependence on frequency observed .",
    "results from the three - band analysis are shown in figure [ fig : result ] .",
    "the upper band has negligible correlation with the other two . for the lower two bands the marginalized results from integrating over their likelihood contours are displayed .",
    "the marginalization shifted the peak of the middle band down by 6@xmath4 , increasing its width by 12@xmath4 .",
    "a fit of the middle @xmath64-band s likelihood to an offset lognormal distribution @xcite gives 66  @xmath6k@xmath0 with a variance of ( 44  @xmath6k@xmath0)@xmath0 and a noise related offset of 93  @xmath6k@xmath0 .",
    "the three most important sources of systematic uncertainty were associated with the telescope pointing , the scan synchronous residual structure and the relative gains . their impact was evaluated on fits of _",
    "e_-mode power to a multiplier of the concordance model ; selected studies confirmed that uncertainties estimated with those fits apply to the three other fitting methods .",
    "the effect of possible mispointing was determined by varying the global pointing solution within its uncertainty , @xmath27 of a beamwidth .",
    "the @xmath68 shifts in azimuth and elevation were added in quadrature , resulting in an uncertainty of @xmath69 .",
    "effects of the ssss were simulated .",
    "it was determined separately in each channel for two halves of the data , divided according to ambient temperature and its extracted ( linear ) variation .",
    "multiple simulations were made with structure added to the cmb according to the ambient temperature in each period .",
    "this shifted the result upward by on average 0.1 ( times concordance ) , and the spread , as the underlying cmb was varied , was @xmath700.1 .",
    "the uncertainty is then conservatively taken to be @xmath71 ( corresponding to a 10@xmath4 uncertainty ) .",
    "the effect of relative gain uncertainties was estimated from the scatter in the result with the gain of each of the 11 polarimeters chosen randomly within the estimated @xmath72% uncertainty , leading to an uncertainty of @xmath73 .",
    "three other sources of uncertainty were studied .",
    "the beam size was uncertain to 2@xmath4 ; varying it by even 10@xmath4 leads to less than a 3@xmath4 change in the result . as mentioned earlier , the polarimeters have a weak response to temperature anisotropies ( @xmath74  db ) , and the optics produces a small quadrupole response at scales smaller than the beam ( @xmath75  db ) .",
    "simulations show that these also lead to negligible effects ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "several checks of the robustness of the result were performed . excluding single radiometers or 25@xmath4 data samples gave consistent results .",
    "difference maps were created by splitting the data into two parts according to high and low system and ambient temperatures and time .",
    "data vectors were produced for each half ( d@xmath76 and d@xmath77 ) and the likelihood was evaluated on ( d@xmath78d@xmath77)/2 .",
    "these likelihoods , together with that for the quadrature data , are shown in figure [ fig : result ] ; none show a signal .",
    "finally , a parallel analysis was performed .",
    "offsets were removed on a 4  s timescale , and an independent code implemented a different pixelization scheme and a different means of evaluating the associated covariance matrix and nulling out the appropriate modes .",
    "it was used to obtain a multiplier to concordance and gave a consistent result .    adding the three main uncertainties in quadrature , the overall systematic uncertainty becomes 17@xmath4 .",
