    "apparently , the continuous medium theory of domain structures in ferroelectrics ( fe ) becomes even more important nowadays than in prior years , when the studies concentrated on properties of the bulk samples .",
    "one of the reasons is that the phenomenological domain theory , established decades ago @xcite , consistently captures the electrostatic and strain effects playing crucial role in very thin high quality fe films available now , and allows to gain an indispensable qualitative insight into the phenomena at hand .",
    "one expects that the theory should break down in atomically thin ferroelectrics , where the calculations should be done from the first principles .",
    "this is formally true , yet the theory applies to most systems of interest that are not just a few monolayers thin , since the atomic length is so small . and the fe systems of most interest to e.g. memory applications would not be that thin .",
    "in fact , they should be thick enough to support a memory of practical interest , and we reach this conclusion safely within the domain of applicability of the continuum theory , as described below .",
    "the present review has a restricted goal : it is aimed at explaining what the continuous medium theory tells us about the properties of thin films with real metallic electrodes , especially as far as domains and ferroelectric memory are concerned .",
    "we shall discuss not only the theory but also some recent data , and we hope that as a result of this discussion , the important role of the phenomenological theory as well as necessary further developments of this theory , will become rather evident    the principal point of the review is that some old theoretical results about specific features of domain structures near a second order fe transition , which were mainly of academic interest , gained practical importance now .",
    "let us recall that close to a second order transition the ferroelectric domain structure can not remain the same as it were far from the transition , where domain walls thickness is smaller than the width of the domains .",
    "the reason it that the domain wall thickness tends to infinity when the temperature approaches the critical temperature @xmath2 , @xmath3 , while the period of the standard domain structure remains almost temperature independent . as a result , some distance away from @xmath2 the width of the domain walls becomes comparable with the width of the domains , i.e. the spatial distribution of the polarization , which represents the domain structure , becomes pretty smooth ( sinusoidal \" ) . one can picture this change as elimination of higher fourier harmonics of the initially staggered distribution of the polarization across the domain structure .",
    "the main harmonic is , obviously , the last to disappear since it defines the main sluggish feature of the domain structure : its period .",
    "disappearance of the main harmonic is the phase transition into the paraelectric phase , which occurs somewhere at temperature , @xmath4 for macroscopic samples with thickness @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the characteristic interatomic distance , the elimination of the higher harmonics is in fact quite sharp : all the above described transformation occurs within a tiny , experimentally inaccessible temperature interval near @xmath7 the thinner the film the broader this interval , and when the film thickness approaches the unit cell size , it may become quite important . indeed , the period of the domain structure is about @xmath8 , ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite and our discussion below ) , while far from @xmath2 the domain wall thickness can be roughly estimated as @xmath6 for the order - disorder transitions and @xmath9 for the displacive ones , where @xmath10k is the so called characteristic atomic  temperature .",
    "these estimates are fairly rough , for example in batio@xmath11 which is usually considered a displacive ferroelectric , the @xmath12degree domain walls parallel to the direction ( 100 ) and the equivalent ones are actually very narrow with the width of about @xmath6 at room temperature .",
    "however , the estimates clearly indicate that in very thin films , with thicknesses approaching @xmath6 and for displacive systems , and _ maybe _ even in thicker films not far from the phase transition , the domain width and the domain wall thickness become comparable , so that the domain structure is expected to be sinusoidal .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the basic physics of an effect of depolarizing field and domains on the phase transition  was well understood since the pioneering work of knzig s group @xcite in 1950s , but the case of the sinusoidal `` domain walls  was first considered by chensky and tarasenko ( cht ) some 30 years later@xcite .",
    "historical aspects of the topic are described in more detail in appendix a. cht were interested in the second order phase transitions in ferroelectric films in both non - electroded and electroded samples with a dielectric ( dead '' ) layer separating the electrodes and the film . in the fe capacitors with metallic electrodes , the role of the dead layers \" is played by the metallic electrode interfacial regions over the thomas - fermi screening length . within the continuous medium theory the mathematical analogy between the two cases is practically exact ( see below ) .",
    "therefore , the model considered by cht was , in fact , very general .",
    "the results attracted little attention so far , since the sinusoidal domains were expected to exist in a minute temperature interval near phase transition in the systems experimentally studied at the time .",
    "now , however , the situation is quite different . in ferroelectric films of atomic thickness",
    ", the sinusoidal regime has been experimentally found to exist in a temperature interval of about @xmath13k near the transitionstreifer02 .",
    "the approach itself , new results , and the relevance of the theory to the present experimental studies of nanoferroelectrics need to be exposed to the ferroelectrics community .",
    "the theory becomes of practical interest , and new problems need to be addressed .",
    "we discuss , in particular , the problem of a ( meta)stable ferroelectric memory .",
    "while most people are currently concentrating on the problem of a _ critical thickness _ for ferroelectricity , which is shown to approach the atomic limit , the real practical problem is that of a ferroelectric _ memory _ ,",
    "i.e. a ( meta)stable state with a net ferroelectric polarization in the film . these are two _ different _ problems , and we are trying to highlight this important distinction .",
    "below , in sec .",
    "ii we present a simple overview of the cht treatment of paraelectric - ferroelectric transition in a film with the ideal metallic electrodes and the dead layers . at the end of this section ,",
    "we demonstrate similarity of the cases of real metallic electrodes and the dead layer treated in@xcite . in very thin strained ( and , as a consequence , uniaxial ) films considered here , where a domain structure is close to the sinusoidal one",
    ", we show the distribution of the polarization , which is reminiscent of the one for the domains with staggered distribution of polarization ( the so - called kittel structure@xcite . )    in secs .",
    "iii , iv we consider the properties of sinusoidal domain structures , mainly their response to an external field .",
    "the main results of these sections present a further development of cht theory .",
    "the algebra involved is relatively simple in cases when the landau - ginzburg - devonshire ( lgd ) free energy contains the powers of polarization @xmath14up to @xmath15 terms only ( in the bulk or in the case of metallic electrodes this would correspond to a second order transition far from a tricritical point ) , or just @xmath16 _ and _ @xmath17 terms ( describing a tricritical transition in the same conditions ) , while in a more general case of a second order and/or the first order transitions it is fairly involved .",
    "we limit ourselves here by the two above cases , which illustrate the main results well enough to enable us to discuss the available experimental data in sec.v .",
    "importantly , irrespective of the conductivity type of electrodes , metallic or semiconducting , the imperfect screening of bound charge of the fe films leads to their splitting into domains@xcite .",
    "the results @xcite are used to discuss the experiments by the noh s team on batio@xmath0 films with srruo electrodes on srtio@xmath0 substrate @xcite in sec.v . there",
    ", we conclude that their 5 nm thick sample is well above the critical thickness for ferroelectricity , but , even by very optimistic estimates , it is below what can be called the critical thickness for the ( meta)stable__ferroelectric memory _ _ with a reasonable lifetime ( e.g. in excess of @xmath18@xcite . unfortunately",
    ", at present the theory can not give the realistic number for this thickness . throughout the review ,",
    "we omit the so - called additional boundary conditions ( abcs ) ,  which include parameters of the surfaces / interfaces and are often taken into account together with conventional electrostatic boundary conditions@xcite . for the experimental system that we discuss here ,",
    "these additional boundary conditions appear inessential , and more details about the additional boundary conditions can be found in appendix b.",
    "the transition point is simultaneously the point of a stability loss of the two phases for any second order phase transition . we shall consider second order transitions from paraelectric phase in an electroded ferroelectric film",
    "this transition can be either into a single domain or a multidomain state . to decide what choice is being realized ( and at what conditions ) the best way is to consider the loss of stability of the phase whose state we know : the paraelectric phase .",
    "let us explain how to determine when the loss of stability occurs by using an elementary example .",
    "we show three forms of a potential energy @xmath19 versus some coordinate @xmath20 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ushape ] . obviously , the state with @xmath21 is stable for @xmath22 , for @xmath23 this state is unstable , and @xmath24 ( the horizontal line ) corresponds to the point where the stability is lost .",
    "the condition of equilibrium @xmath25 has only the trivial solutions for @xmath26 but an infinite number of nontrivial solutions for @xmath27 for the potential energy of a more general form , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , we have the same point of the stability loss , but @xmath25 has the trivial solution only for @xmath30 however , the _ linearized _ form of @xmath31 near the origin @xmath21 is the same as before .",
    "we have , therefore , the method of finding the conditions of instability of a given state ( or phase ) : one has to linearize the equations whose solution represents the state in question and look for the conditions when this system of equations has a nontrivial solution .     as a function of",
    "coordinate @xmath20 for various @xmath32 : @xmath22 , the state with @xmath21 is stable ; @xmath24 , point of stability loss of the state with @xmath21 ; @xmath23 , stability at @xmath21 is lost . ,",
    "width=245 ]    we shall consider a uniaxial ferroelectric with the ferroelectric axis perpendicular to the film plane , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fefilmschema ] .     separating it from the electrodes , or the real electrodes with thomas - fermi screening length @xmath33.,width=264 ]    this is the case , for example , of batio@xmath0 ( bto ) films compressively strained on srruo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 ( sro / sto ) substrate .",
    "the strained cubic crystal behaves as a uniaxial ferroelectric with second- or weak first - order phase transition .",
    "we restrict ourselves here to the case of a second order ferroelectric transition in the bulk , i.e. the landau - ginzburg - devonshire ( lgd ) free energy density is assumed to have the form : @xmath34where @xmath35 is the _ _ ferroelectric _ _  ( switchable)component of polarization along the polar axis @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the  _ nonferroelectric _ part of the polarization along the @xmath38-axis with  @xmath39 directly related to the so - called _ background _ dielectric constant ( see the methodological note below ) , @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 , @xmath45 the gradient operator in the plane @xmath46 of the film . to simplify the formulas",
    ", we shall assume that the gradient coefficient is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the kronecker symbol . here",
    ", the landau coefficients are renormalized by the strain produced by the lattice misfit with the substrate @xmath49 @xcite , see the appendix d ( for bto on sto  @xmath50    importantly , we do not include the striction terms that couple strain to @xmath51 terms in ( [ lgd ] )  because they renormalize the @xmath52 term and this does _ not _ affect the loss of stability of symmetric phase in a system like bto on sto ( see below ) .",
    "the point is that , as we said above , finding the loss of stability boils down to solving a linear problem , while this term is _ nonlinear _ and does not affect the problem .",
    "the statements to the contrary by pertsev and kohlstedt in ref.@xcite , that the elastic coupling defines the point of the stability loss and the critical thickness of the fe  films , are qualitatively incorrect , as pointed out in ref .",
    "the above form of @xmath53 yields the equation of state for the ferroelectric via standard relation : @xmath54@xmath55which means that the local electric field is in one - to - one correspondence with the local ferro- and nonferroelectric components of the polarization .      since we do not know what type of solutions corresponds to the horizontal line in fig .",
    "[ fig : ushape ] , we should check all the possibilities .",
    "we start by trying the simplest one , a homogeneous change of polarization .",
    "this situation is described by the linearized equation of state for a _ homogeneous _",
    "polarization @xmath56 ( and the nonferroelectric part @xmath57@xmath58where @xmath59 is the homogeneous field in the ferroelectric .",
    "the dead layer is a linear dielectric , which is described by an equation analogous to ( eqstate1c ) , hence it is not necessary to consider explicitly the polarization of the dead layer , and we shall describe it by its dielectric constant @xmath60 .",
    "the boundary condition at the interface of the ferroelectric ( continuity of the normal component of the displacement vector ) then reads @xmath61where @xmath62 is the field in the dead layer .",
    "we can rewrite the above equation as@xmath63where @xmath64 is the `` background dielectric constant '' , @xmath65 .",
    "there is also a condition of a zero applied bias ( short circuiting , @xmath66 ) : @xmath67we find from the above the depolarizing field in the fe film : @xmath68and we see that the field in the dead layer is much stronger than the field in the fe film , @xmath69 because is does not contain the small parameter @xmath70 , and it is realistic to assume @xmath71 .",
    "importantly , the field is concentrated in the dead layers , yet since the layers are very thin , its contribution to the total free energy appears to be negligible ( see below ) .",
    "the system of homogeneous equations  ( eqstate1c),([dep ] ) for @xmath59  and @xmath72  has nontrivial solutions only when @xmath73this would define the temperature of the stability loss of the paraelectric phase with regards to a _ homogeneous _ polarization .",
    "it would happen at a lower temperature than the loss of stability of the paraelectric phase in a very thick slab ( @xmath74 ) or in absence of a dead layer and ideal metallic electrodes ( @xmath75  @xmath76 ) .",
    "recall that absence of nontrivial solutions at values of @xmath77  which do not satisfy eq.([eq : ah ] ) means either stability of the solution @xmath78  ( the paraelectric phase ) or instability of this solution ( see fig.1 ) . and , therefore , stability of another homogeneous solution with @xmath79  which has to be found from the full , nonlinearized , equation of state .",
    "let us emphasize that this is not necessarily the absolutely stable state but might be a metastable state because we did not consider competing inhomogeneous states which might have a lower energy .",
    "also the temperature defined by eq.([eq : ah ] ) is @xmath80 , in general , the temperature at which the paraelectric phase ceases to exist : one has to consider a loss of stability with respect to an _ inhomogeneous _ polarization as well , in order to determine which one sets in first .",
    "now , consider the case of _ _  a finite bias _",
    "_ voltage @xmath31 .  in this case , the equilibrium polarization in the _ paraelectric _ phase is non - zero , and so are the electric fields in the ferroelectric and the dead layer .",

    "( [ eqstate1a ] ) , we obtain @xmath84where @xmath72 stands for the equilibrium homogeneous polarization .",

    "lets check that the homogeneous transition would also be smeared out in the case of the dead layers .",
    "checking for the stability loss with respect to a homogeneous polarization , we linearize the equation of state ( [ eqstate1a ] ) near @xmath86 , @xmath87 , where @xmath88  is the electric field in the ferroelectric in the state with @xmath89 , and obtain @xmath90where @xmath91 and @xmath92 we obtain the same equations for the fluctuation of the polarization @xmath93 and the field @xmath94 as for the short - circuited case with the only difference that @xmath77 should be replaced by @xmath95 we have already found [ cf .",

    "we have already mentioned that in the case of the ideal metallic electrodes there is no loss of stability and the phase transition is smeared , i.e. @xmath98 is always positive under a finite bias voltage .",
    "we have proven that in a ferroelectric with the dead layers ( or _ real _ metallic electrodes ) the phase transition with respect to the _ homogeneous _ polarization is smeared out by an external electric field . as was mentioned above",
    ", this does _ not _ mean that there is no phase transition .",
    "indeed , there is a possibility that in an external field the film may be losing stability with respect to inhomogeneous polarization .",
    "if this takes place , a second order ( unsmeared ) phase transition occurs this is why we shall study a loss of stability with respect to the inhomogeneous polarization in a general case of applied external bias voltage .",
    "following the same general procedure , we should be looking for a first occurrence of a nontrivial solution to a linearized equation of state that allows for inhomogeneous polarization : @xmath100since an inhomogeneous polarization @xmath101 produces an electric field both across the film ( @xmath102axis ) and in perpendicular directions , we should add an equation of state for the two other polarization components .",

    "( [ ansatz ] ) , we have already tremendously simplified the problem : for every @xmath113 we will have a system of ordinary differential equations , instead of a system of partial differential equations .",
    "further , we can identify @xmath114 too .",
    "first of all , this function should be as smooth as possible",
    ". indeed , the bound charge associated with the inhomogeneous ferroelectric polarization @xmath116 should be as small as possible to reduce the electric field energy .",
    "it is unreasonable to have @xmath117 , the bound charge at the ferroelectric - dead layer interface will be proportional to this constant .",
    "more reasonable would be to make it nearly constant deep inside the ferroelectric yet smaller at the interface .",
    "taking into account that it should be a solution of a differential equation with the constant coefficients , we are left with an ansatz : @xmath118where @xmath119 is another unknown parameter , which we expect to be much smaller than @xmath120 a critical reader could study other options .",
    "it may seem formally possible to try @xmath121 for example , but this is a bad choice that fails to satisfy the boundary conditions ( see below ) , which are possible to satisfy with eq .",
    "( [ ansatz1 ] ) .    using eq .",
    "( [ eqstate1b ] ) , one obtains for the ansatz ( [ ansatz1 ] ) : @xmath122the electrostatics equation ( [ el1])@xmath123yields @xmath124and one finds that @xmath125thus , we have found the electric field in the ferroelectric assuming _ _  _ _ that we have a polarization wave .",
    "this assumption is consistent if this field satisfies the second electrostatic equation ( [ el2 ] ) , or @xmath126we can easily get rid of @xmath127 in the above equation by differentiating it with respect to @xmath36 and using eq.([eq : curle ] ) to obtain @xmath128substituting here the ansatz ( [ ezf ] ) , we find the value of @xmath129 at which the non - trivial solutions are possible as a function of  the parameters @xmath113 and @xmath119 : @xmath130    it is still premature to look for a maximum of this function ( a point , where the instability sets in first ) , because we have also ( i )  to find the fields from the electrostatic equations in the dead layer and ( ii )  to satisfy the boundary conditions .",

    "the mathematical equivalence of electrostatics and magnetostatics led , at the beginning of development of  the theory of ferroelectric domain structure , to applying the relevant results of the theory of magnetic domain structures to the case of ferroelectrics .",
    "the ferromagnetic domains were postulated by weiss in 1907 . however , until 1935 their origin had not been actually understood .",
    "several authors tried to understand their origin within statistical mechanics of an infinite medium .",
    "this was even the case with such an outstanding scientist as f.bloch,@xcite curiously , in the same paper where he considered the famous bloch domain wall \" . in 1935",
    "landau and lifshitz @xcite pointed out futility of these efforts and indicated the demagnetizing effect of surfaces as the origin of ferromagnetic domains , i.e. the demagnetizing field existing in finite magnetic bodies .",
    "landau and lifshitz proposed a fairly complete theory of ferromagnetic domain structure and obtained some formulas which since then were often attributed to other authors .",
    "for instance , the proportionality of the width of the domains to the square root of a film thickness @xmath271 is frequently attributed to kittel ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "kittel highly appreciated the landau and lifshitz work and has further developed their theory in 1940 s summarizing the landau and lifshitz s and his own results in his often cited review @xcite . for",

    "they argued that in a slab of an uniaxial ferroelectric , e.g. kh@xmath500po@xmath502 , with the polar axis perpendicular to the slab plane no phase transition into mono - domain state is possible and the only possibility of phase transition into ferroelectric phase is with formation of a domain structure .",
    "this phase transition should occur at a lower temperature and the lowering of temperature is inversely proportional to the slab thickness .",
    "they tried to estimate this lowering of the phase transition temperature to find what is now called `` the critical thickness for the ferroelectricity '' in the case of kh@xmath500po@xmath502 .",
    "they also clearly understood that their estimates are irrelevant to the case of a three - axial ferroelectric such as batio@xmath0 where the closure domains ( nowadays called vortices \" ) should form .",
    "the possibility of screening of the depolarizing field not only by free charges from the electrodes but also by the charge carriers of the material itself was also clearly realized at the very beginning of a systematic study of ferroelectricity .",
    "one can see the relevant discussion , in e.g. papers by the group of knzig @xcite .",
    "ivanchik @xcite considered the possibility of a mono - domain state in a slab of nonelectroded uniaxial ferroelectric taking into account the screening of the depolarizing field by the carriers of the material , which was treated as a semiconductor with a large band gap .",
    "later he and others @xcite took also into account the screening by metallic and semiconductor electrodes .",
    "also in 1960s , the effect of finite screening length of metallic electrodes on dielectric measurements has been discussed by several authors @xcite .",
    "batra and silverman batrasil criticized some details of an approach adopted by ivanchik s group and considered an effect of incomplete screening by the electrodes on the phase transition into the ferroelectric state assuming that the phase transition proceeds into a mono - domain state .",

    "et al_.@xcite . similar to the ivanchik s group , the main assumption of two series of paper , stability of the mono - domain state was never checked although earlier bjorkstam and oettel @xcite pointed out that incomplete screening due to a near electrode dead layer may lead to the same domain structure as in non - electroded samples .",
    "it is clear now that the assumption about a monodomain state is almost never satisfied for realistic parameters of the systems , at least close to the phase transition .",
    "chensky @xcite substantially improved the knzig s group determination of lowering of a phase transition temperature due to impossibility of transition into a monodomain state in a nonelectroded slab of a ferroelectric with the polar axis perpendicular to the slab . * *  * * selyuk considered screening of the depolarizing field by both space and surface charges and found that below the phase transition a monodomain state may become energetically more favorable than the multi - domain one @xcite .",
    "the next important step was the chensky and tarasenko paper mentioned in the introduction .",

    "while discussing surface structural phase transitions , these authors have pointed out that when @xmath185 can be identified with polarization perpendicular to the surface , the de gennes - zaitsev boundary conditions should be complemented by an additional term which makes them inhomogeneous .",
    "bratkovsky and levanyuk @xcite have explicitly taken into account the complete boundary conditions considering phase transition in a slab of uniaxial ferroelectric with ideal metallic electrodes . because of the inhomogeneity of the boundary conditions , the polarization is never zero over all the volume , even in the paraelectric phase , though the region where it is not zero is the same as the near - surface region in the kretschmer and binder theory , i.e. its thickness is comparable to interatomic distances .",
    "still , to study stability of the paraelectric phase one has to linearize the problem not with respect to @xmath549 but with respect to @xmath550 an inhomogeneous distribution existing in the paraelectric phase . as a result , instead of eq.([stabkb ] ) for @xmath369 one has an equation for @xmath551 with the coefficient of the first term @xmath552 instead of @xmath77 in eq.([stabkb ] ) .",
    "this means an additional ' ' hardening `` of the surface layer or an effective positive renormalization of the coefficient @xmath422 calculated in ref .",
    "this means , e.g. , that a surface which is ' ' soft `` , @xmath553 for polarization parallel to the surface , may be ' ' hard \" with respect to polarization perpendicular to the same surface .",
    "the polarity of surfaces leads also to smearing of the phase transition if the two surfaces are different @xcite .    here",
    ", we have given only a very brief overview of the phenomenological theory of the surface effect on ferroelectric phase transitions leaving aside both microscopic theories and discussion of other effects of the surfaces , e.g. their role in the polarization switching ( see tagantsev1 ) . in 1990s ,",
    "when thin ferroelectric films became a popular topic there appeared numerous papers reconsidering the phenomenological theory and trying to find its parameters from the experimental data or microscopic theories .",
    "we shall not review these papers because , to our understanding , they did not advanced much the development of the phenomenological theory in comparison with the papers cited above .",
    "this certainly true of the formulation of the boundary conditions and finding the phase transition temperature that we were concerned about in this appendix .",
    "we do not take into account the abc in the present review .",
    "from the point of view of electrodynamics of continuous media , this is allowed since the `` spatial dispersion of the dielectric constant '' is taken into account in the direction parallel to the surface ( @xmath20 ) and , in effect , not in the direction perpendicular to the surface ( @xmath36 ) : the coefficient @xmath554 does not enter our final formulas .",
    "physically , this is justified by the rigidity of polarization with respect to its variation along @xmath102axis , which we have discussed while reviewing the results of kretschmer and binder .",
    "in addition , the experimental data for the system ( bto  on sto / sro )  we have used to illustrate the theory indicates that the abc can be neglected @xcite .",
    "there is a lot of confusion in the literature with regards to the formula for the energy of a ferroelectric with account for both the voltage source and the electric field due to the polarization of the material .",
    "that is why we preferred to use the equations of state as long as possible and , when being forced to consider the free energy , we demonstrate its correctness by comparing the results obtained from the equations of state and from minimization of the free energy . by the way , the trouble with the watanabe s papers @xcite mentioned in the historical note is due to his use of the free energy while the ivanchik s group used the equations of state to treat the same problem .    to begin with , we note that some authors write the lgd functional as a function of @xmath555 while others did it as function of the dielectric displacement @xmath556 the first group includes ginzburg @xcite , devonshire @xcite , jona and shirane @xcite , as well as many others , e.g. batra _ et al_. and the present authors .",
    "the second group includes importantly lines and glass lines and , e.g. ivanchik _ _ et al.__@xcite , @xcite .",
    "there is also the third group led by tagantsev @xcite , @xcite who pointed out that in some situations it is important to take into account that the order parameter does not refer to the total polarization but only to a part of it and there is also another `` background '' or `` noncritical '' contribution . in some problems",
    "it should be taken into account when the effects of depolarizing field are considered . in this review , unlike in our previous works , we have taken it into account but it proved out that it disappears from the final results for the problems that we considered here , which is not necessarily the case for some other problems .    we think that the origin of existence of these variations in the functional representations is the landau and lifshitz book `` electrodynamics of continuous media '' published in the ussr in 1957 and translated into english in 1960 @xcite . this excellent book had a mishap of using @xmath557 instead of @xmath555 exactly in the section devoted to ferroelectrics .",
    "it has been eliminated in the second edition of the book @xcite ,  at least partially , but , because , perhaps , of a great authority of landau , the confusion originated .",
    "the reason why landau and lifshitz put what we call now the lgd thermodynamic potential as a function of @xmath558 is that the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of a system in a presence of an external voltage source are described by thermodynamic potential depending on @xmath556 this reasoning is flawed , however , because the thermodynamic potential ( or free energy ) of the landau theory of phase transitions@xcite is a _ non - equilibrium _ thermodynamic potential ( free energy ) .",
    "it depends on the order parameter apart from the conventional thermodynamic variables and only after minimization with respect to the order parameter and substitution of its equilibrium value into the original formula one obtains the equilibrium thermodynamic potential .",
    "the order parameter describes the structural changes in the material leading to the breaking of symmetry , which is the central idea of this theory . in the case , of e.g. cubic - tetragonal phase transition in batio@xmath559 this structural change consists mainly in shift of the ti ion with respect to the ba sublattice . of course",
    ", the o ions also displace but to change the symmetry from cubic to tetragonal the shift of ti ions is sufficient .",
    "equally , a shift of only o ions without a shift of ti ions would lead to the same symmetry breaking .",
    "this illustrates the statement that in the landau theory the physical meaning of the order parameter does not matter but only its symmetry properties . for ferroelectrics ,",
    "this is emphasized in the book by strukov and levanyuk @xcite and is correct while the effects of the  depolarizing field are not considered .",
    "quite often , it makes no difference whether to use @xmath560 or @xmath558 within the region of applicability of the `` orthodox '' landau theory , i.e. for small values of the order parameter and not far from the phase transition .",
    "it is known , in particular , that in ferroelectrics normally @xmath561 , i.e.@xmath562 however , even close to the phase transition one has to take into account that the physical order parameter represents structural changes with respect to which the system loses its stability at the transition , while considering effects of the depolarizing field . in the case of proper ferroelectrics ,",
    "these structural changes can be related to a polarization but not necessarily to the full polarization of the crystal . at the same time",
    ", it is the latter which enters the electrostatics equations .",
    "this can make it necessary to take into account the `` background dielectric constant '' , which is an independent phenomenological constant not entering the `` orthodox '' landau expansion , to be determined from the experimental data or from the microscopic theory .",
    "we see that much care is needed while applying the lgd theory to discuss different phenomena in ferroelectrics .",
    "the examples where the proper care was not taken are too numerous to be discussed here .",
    "one can say only that the book by strukov and levanyuk @xcite can be improved in this regard . as an illustrative example , recall the boundary condition for the order parameter imposed by ivanchik @xcite who considered a homogeneously polarized ferroelectric slab with a depolarizing field screened by the charge carriers of the material .",
    "the electrostatics dictates that the value of @xmath563 , should be zero at the surface .",
    "since ivanchik considered @xmath563 as the order parameter entering the lgd functional he was forced to conclude that the order parameter is zero at the surface .",
    "but what does it mean ? that the ti or o ions in the surface layer are forced to stay in the same positions as in the cubic phase ?",
    "these ions can be shifted , of course , but in such a way that at the surface @xmath564 this is clearly seen if one considers @xmath565 as the order parameter .",
    "one concludes that at the surface @xmath566 but these quantities are not necessary zero and what are their values is a separate question .",
    "if one takes into account the background dielectric constant ( @xmath64 ) one obtains  @xmath567  which does not change the qualitative result but may be important for numerical estimations .",
    "batra and silverman @xcite ( see historical note ) were right in their criticism of ivanchik s boundary condition in spite of considering a case where this condition is not necessary and where using either @xmath565 or @xmath563 as the order parameter makes no difference , and it is also not necessary to take into account @xmath568    there are several equivalent forms of writing down the free energy of ferroelectric taking into account electric field created by the polarization itself and by external voltage source in the cases where there is no other source of the field rather than the ferroelectric polarization ( like in a non - electroded ferroelectric slab ) or there is no electric field outside of the ferroelectric and the voltage source ( like in a ferroelectric slab with the ideal metallic electrodes ) .",
    "we shall not discuss these forms here because we are interested in a more general case .",
    "let us mention only that a careless generalization to this case of one of the above - mentioned formulas leads quite often to errors , which could be avoided if the authors were to compare at least some of their results with those obtained from the system of equations of state and equations of electrostatics .",
    "obviously , the equations of state usually generate much less controversy than the forms of the free energy .    in the present review ,",
    "we use nearly the  same formula for the free energy as chensky and tarasenko @xcite , with the only difference in writing a noncritical polarization term .",
    "they did not discuss the origin of their formula but we shall explain why we think it is quite natural . conceptually , it follows the same line as , e.g. the calculation of energy of collective excitations accompanied by long - range ( electric or magnetic ) fields @xcite .",
    "first , one considers these excitations without any long - range fields as if these fields were compensated by external charges or currents , the so - called `` mechanical excitons '' .",
    "then , one adds the energy of the long - range field created by the exciton without an account for the changes , which such fields could produce in the exciton itself , i.e. as if the fields were created in vacuum by the bound charges or the ampere currents of the `` mechanical exciton '' . in our case , the mechanical `` part for the ferroelectric energy is given by eq.([lgd ] ) , which does not contain any electric field and @xmath369 in this formula has to be considered as a purely structural parameter .",
    "there is of course also a ' ' mechanical `` noncritical part of the dead layer . the both have the form of the first term  of the lgd formula ( with another coefficient , of course ) , because we do not take into account neither nonlinearities ( the second term ) nor the spatial dispersion ( the third and the fourth terms ) in the noncritical dielectric properties and in those of the dead layer .",
    "it is shown in the text , see eq.([elendiel ] ) , that the sum of the two energies , the ' ' mechanical `` and the ' ' purely electric `` ones , gives what is used to be called the energy of electric field in a dielectric '' .",
    "if we had considered explicitly a real metallic electrode , which we avoided for simplicity sake , we would be obliged to take into account not only the energy associated with the displacements of its atoms and deformations of the filled electronic shells ( the `` background dielectric constant '' ) , but also an energy associated with redistribution of electrons in the conduction band , while calculating the `` mechanical''energy of the electrode .",
    "this part is quite often overlooked but a detailed discussion of this question would take too much space to do it here .",
    "the landau parameters entering the equation of state of perovskite batio@xmath569 film on srruo@xmath570srtio@xmath0 entering eq.([eqstate1a ] )  are found from the parameters for the bulk bto  @xcite under conditions of homogeneous in - plane misfit strain @xmath571 : @xmath572where @xmath573the dielectric function in direction along the film @xmath574 , where @xmath575 pertsev98 .",
    "when the strain drives transition second order from the weak first order , one can approximate the dielectric function in a direction along the easy axis @xmath36 and @xmath576 ( perpendicular to the film plane ) as @xmath577 . the bulk bto parameters appearing above are ( in si  units ) : @xmath578c@xmath579m@xmath580n , where @xmath581 is the temperature in @xmath582c , @xmath583c@xmath584m@xmath585n@xmath586 @xmath587c@xmath588m@xmath589n@xmath586 @xmath590c@xmath591m@xmath592n , @xmath593 @xmath594 @xmath595 ( c@xmath596m@xmath580 ) @xcite .",
    "the components of the compliance tensor for bto are @xmath597 @xmath598 and @xmath599 ( in units of m@xmath580n@xmath600 ) .",
    "here in the text we are using the standard cgs units instead of the siunits , and the quantity we need to make estimates is the ( dimensionless in cgs )  first landau coefficient @xmath601 , @xmath602 at room temperature .",
    "the coefficient @xmath603 is found from ( [ eq : par1]),([eq : par2 ] ) and other relations given above .",
    "the gradient coefficient @xmath184 for batio@xmath0 was estimated from the neutron scattering data @xcite in the following way .",
    "the experimental data gives the dependence of the soft mode frequency on the wave vector for the directions perpendicular to ( 100 ) . in terms of the present paper , the soft mode frequency in the paraelectric phase",
    "can be obtained from the polarization dynamic equation : @xmath604where @xmath605 is a coefficient which will be determined , and @xmath606 is the wave vector in the plane perpendicular to ( 100 ) .",
