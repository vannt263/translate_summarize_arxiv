    "the wide distribution of excitations , as seen in bulk dielectric measuments , is therefore believed to be caused largely by spatial variation of the characteristic time scales ; see also ref.@xcite .",
    "regions in  a glassy system separated by only a few nanometers relax on time scales different by many orders of magnitude .    whether these purely dynamical phenomena can be explained in terms of the underlying _ energy landscape _",
    "is still debated .",
    "the question has been positively answered on the level of the mean field theory of glasses .",
    "the dynamical , ideal mode coupling theory@xcite and energy landscape based replica mean field theories were demonstrated to describe the same underlying physics , yet from rather different perspectives@xcite . the idealized version of the mode coupling theory@xcite falls out of equilibrium below a temperature @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the laboratory glass temperature ( see below ) .",

    "thus , the configurational entropy @xmath5 becomes extensive and only vanishes at the kauzmann tempeature @xmath6 .",
    "unfortunately , neither the emergence of slow activated dynamics , nor the possibility of spatial heterogeneity are correctly captured within mean field theory , making it impossible to use mean field theory alone to directly explain the heterogeneous dynamics observed in numerous glass forming liquids . on the other hand ,",
    "mode coupling theory at higher temperatures ( @xmath7 ) has been shown to give a reasonably accurate account of the dynamics of liquids . at lower temperatures ( @xmath8 ) ,",
    "bulk thermodynamic properties of glassforming liquids , most notably the temperature dependence of the configurational entropy and the related kauzmann paradox@xcite , agree with the results of the energy landscape based mean field theory ( see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "this motivated the development of a theory for glassforming liquids that has its foundation in the mean field theory , but that does take into account activated dynamics and spatial heterrogeneity which are beyond the strict mean field approachkw87,ktw89 .",
    "the resulting random first order  ( rfot ) theory of glasses demonstrates that ergodicity above the kauzmann temperature @xmath9 can be restored via entropic droplets , in which a region of the liquid is replaced by any of an exponentially large number of alternatives .",
    "the entropy of the possible alternatives acts as a driving force for structure change .",

    "within rfot , the number of metastable states determines the activation barrier of the glassy state .",
    "while this is similar to the adam - gibbs theory for glasses@xcite , there exist important distinctions between the two approaches , see ref.@xcite . in agreement with the rfot approach but not with the assumptions of adams - gibbs argument the complexity of a correlated region increases as the glass transition",

    "the need for instanton like events to understand the long time dynamics in glasses is also supported by recent findings extended mode - coupling theories for dense fluids@xcite .",

    "this approach based on instantons offers a formal justification of the entropic droplet approach using the replica approach to glasses .",
    "it reproduces and thus confirms several results of the random first order transition ( rfot ) theory of structural glasses@xcite . in both approaches , a mean droplet activation energy @xmath10 occurs that is determined by the configurational entropy density @xmath11 ( for details see below ) : @xmath12@xmath13 vanishes linearly at the kauzmann temperature @xmath14 .",

    "@xcite and seems to be a first correction containing the effects that lead to a reduction of the exponent @xmath15 from the value @xmath20 .",
    "numerous experiments on supercooled liquids not only depend on the mean barrier , @xmath10 , but are sensitive to the entire , broad excitation spectrum in glasses@xcite .",
    "most notably , the broad peaks in the imaginary part of the dielectric function @xmath25 are most natually understood in terms of a distribution @xmath26 of relaxation times ,  such that @xmath27similarly dynamical heterogeneity with spatially fluctuating relaxation times yields nonexponential ( frequently streched exponential ) relaxation of the correlation function @xmath28and allows for an explanation of nonresonant hole burning experimentsdiezemann01 , even though interesting interpretations of the non - exponentiality based on `` dynamical homogeneity '' exist as well@xcite .",

    "we then generalize the replica formalism to determine barrier fluctuations in addition to the determination of the mean barrier @xmath10 .",
    "our approach is an important step to gain insight into the whole spectrum of activated processes in glassy systems in general .",
    "the role of barrier fluctuations within the rfot theory of structural glasses was first discussed  by xia and wolynes in ref.@xcite .",

    "our results will demonstrate that the leading droplet size dependence of @xmath51 agrees with eq.[xw ] and ref.@xcite .",
    "we also show that there are additional terms originating in the fluctuations of the interface tension of entropic droplets that contribute to @xmath51 .",
    "in addition we analyze the temperature dependence of the static barrier fluctuations and of the  exponent @xmath52 for stretched exponential relaxation as well as the variation of the dielectric response with frequency and temperature .",
