    "in 1695 , leibniz laid the foundations of fractional - order derivative which means the extension of integer - order derivative concept @xcite , but the first systematic studies seem to have been made at the beginning and middle of the nineteenth century by liouville , riemann , and holmgren .",
    "liouville has expanded functions in series of exponentials and defined the @xmath2th - order derivative of such a series by operating term - by - term as though @xmath2 were a positive integer .",
    "riemann proposed a different definition that involved a definite integral and was applicable to power series with non - integer exponents .",
    "it was gr@xmath1nwald and krug who first unified the results of liouville and riemann .",
    "gr@xmath1nwald , by returning to the original sources and adopting as starting point the definition of a derivative as the limit of a difference quotient and arriving at definite - integral formulas for the @xmath2th - order derivative .",
    "krug , working through cauchy s integral formula for ordinary derivatives , showed that riemann s definite integral had to be interpreted as having a finite lower limit while liouville s definition corresponded to a lower limit @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the riemann - liouville derivatives have certain disadvantages when trying to model real - world phenomena with fractional differential equations . in the second half of the twentieth century caputo",
    "proposed a modified concept of a fractional derivative @xcite , by inverting the composite order of integer - order derivative operator and integral operator arising in the riemann - liouville definition , the resulting definition is better suited to such tasks .",
    "it has been found that many systems in interdisciplinary fields can be described by the fractional differential equations , such as viscoelastic systems , dielectric polarization , electrode - electrolyte polarization , electromagnetic waves , and quantum evolution of complex systems @xcite . due to the growing interest of fractional - order derivatives to be applied in different areas",
    ", it seems analysis of this type of derivative is of great importance .",
    "the existence of periodic solutions is often a desired property in dynamical systems , constituting one of the most important research directions in the theory of dynamical systems , with applications ranging from celestial mechanics to biology and finance . in chaos theory ,",
    "the idea of chaos control is based on the fact that chaotic attractors have a skeleton made of an infinite number of unstable periodic orbits which are subjected for stabilization @xcite .",
    "thus for chaos control in fractional order systems , it is important to show that periodic solutions exist in such systems .",
    "tavazoei @xcite have proved that the fractional - order derivatives of a periodic function with a specific period can not be a periodic function with the same period , as a consequence , the periodic solution can not be detected in fractional - order systems , under any circumstances @xcite .",
    "this property limits the applicability areas of fractional - order systems and makes it unfavorable , for a wide range of periodic real phenomena . therefore enlarging the applicability of fractional - order systems to such real area",
    "is an important research topic .",
    "the most important contribution of this paper is to this end .",
