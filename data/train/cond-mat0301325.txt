    "the subject of this article is the theoretical description of amphiphilic systems , which are one example of _ soft condensed matter_. soft matter is material that has a typical energy scale of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath2 is room temperature . for such material ,",
    "perturbations arising from the thermally activated movement of its molecular components are sufficient to induce configurational changes , and entropy is at least equally important as energy in determining its material properties .",
    "the understanding of the underlying mechanisms is essential for the application of many technologies in everyday life , including colloidal dispersions ( paints , inks , food , creams , lotions ) , foams ( beverages ) , liquid crystals ( displays ) , polyelectrolyte gels ( diapers ) and soaps ( washing and cleaning ) .",
    "moreover , the term _ soft matter _ also includes most biomaterials , for example blood or cartilage .",
    "one particularly important biomaterial is the _ biomembrane _ , that is the protein carrying lipid bilayer which surrounds each cell and its organelles . a good model system for the structural properties of biomembranes are _ lipid bilayers _ , which form spontaneously in mixtures of water and lipids and which are one of the main subjects of this paper .",
    "soft matter systems are very often characterized by competing interactions ( including entropic ones ) , which lead to structure formation on the length scale between tens and hundreds of nanometers ( 1  nm = @xmath3 m ) . since",
    "this length scale is not accessible by optical lithography , self - assembly in soft matter systems is one of the main concepts of nanoscience . with structure formation being so prominent in soft matter systems , their theoretical description often centers around their spatial structure in three dimensions . for a rough classification of the different approaches used",
    ", it is convenient to use an analogy to the field of random geometries , and to distinguish between point , fiber and surface processes . examples of systems which are suited for approaches along these lines are colloidal dispersions , polymer networks and sheet - like structures in self - assembling amphiphilic systems , respectively . here",
    "we will treat the latter case , but we will also show that surface dominated system can be related to gibbs distributions for scalar fields , namely through the use of isosurface constructions .    schematic representation of different amphiphilic molecules .",
    "hydrophobic tails are to the left , hydrophilic heads to the right .",
    "( a ) pentaethylene glycol dodecyl ether , @xmath4 or in short @xmath5 , is a small surfactant .",
    "( b ) lauric acid , @xmath6 or in short la . fatty acids are the simplest amphiphiles and can be dissolved to high amounts in phospholipid bilayers .",
    "( c ) dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine , or in short dlpc .",
    "phosphatidylcholines have two hydrocarbon tails and a zwitterionic headgroup .",
    "they are abundant in animal cells and the best studied model system for biological lipids .",
    "( d ) monoolein , a monoacyl glycerol with one ( unsaturated ) hydrocarbon tail . ]    _ amphiphilic systems _ are solutions of amphiphiles in suitable solvent .",
    "_ amphiphiles _ are molecules which consist of two parts , one being hydrophilic ( water - like , called the head ) and one being hydrophobic ( oil - like , called the tail ) .",
    "well known classes of amphiphiles are _ tensides _",
    "( used for washing and cleaning purposes ) and _ lipids _ ( the basic components of biomembranes ) . shows several examples for which phase diagrams are discussed below .",
    "tensides are often called _",
    "surfactants _ , due to their ace ivity at interfaces between water - like and oil - like phases .",
    "hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules demix due to the hydrophobic effect : oil - like molecules are expelled from a region of water - like molecules since they disturb their network of hydrogen bonds .",
    "hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts of an amphiphilic molecule can not demix due to the covalent linkage between them , but the amphiphiles can self - assemble in such a way as to shield its hydrophilic parts from its hydrophobic ones and vice versa .",
    "amphiphilic systems have many similarities with diblock copolymer systems , for which the term _ microphase separation _ is used to denote the molecular tendency for structure formation ( see the contribution by robert magerle ) .",
    "however , in contrast to diblock copolymers , amphiphiles are small molecules , thus the entropy of their molecular configurations plays only a minor role in determining the overall structure . moreover , whereas in diblock copolymer systems one component is sufficient to obtain stable mesophases , in amphiphilic systems usually the presence of an aqueous solvent is necessary to obtain well - pronounced structure formation .",
    "both diblock copolymer and amphiphilic systems show structure formation on the nanometer scale , but the length scale is set by different control parameters : for diblock copolymers and amphiphiles , these are polymer size and solvent concentrations , respectively . since the solvent in an amphiphilic system usually has no special physical properties by itself , its properties are mostly determined by its interfaces .",
    "this stands in marked contrast to the case of diblock copolymer systems , where the entropy of chain configurations in the regions away from the interfaces can not be neglected in a physical description ( for a review see @xcite and references therein ) . as we will discuss in more detail below",
    ", interface descriptions have been very successful in describing the properties of amphiphilic systems ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "self - assembly of amphiphiles : ( a ) in binary systems , amphiphiles self - assemble into bilayers , micelles and vesicles in order to shield the hydrophobic tails from the aqueous solvent .",
    "( b ) in ternary systems , the oil - like solvent swells the hydrophobic regions .",
    "if the oil - like solvent is the majority component , inverse structures occur . in ternary systems ,",
    "all interfaces are amphiphilic monolayers . ]",
    "amphiphilic systems can be classified according to the solvent used . a mixture of water and amphiphile",
    "is called a _ binary _ system , and a mixture of water , oil and amphiphile",
    "is called a _ ternary",
    "in binary systems , amphiphiles self - assemble into spherical , cylindrical or bilayer structure in such a way that the hydrophobic tails are shielded from the hydrophilic solvent ; in ternary systems , amphiphiles self - assemble into monolayer structures in such a way that the hydrophobic tails and the hydrophilic heads face the hydrophobic and hydrophilic solvents , respectively ( see ) .",
    "irrespective of these differences , amphiphiles in binary and ternary systems assemble into similar geometries , because in both cases one deals with extended sheet - like structures ( the same geometries also occur in diblock copolymer systems ) . at room temperature ,",
    "amphiphiles in mono- and bilayers usually form a two - dimensional fluid , that is the molecular constituents show only short - ranged and no long - ranged order in the plane of the interface . therefore the sheet - like structures in amphiphilic systems are called _ fluid membranes _ ( in fact membrane fluidity is essential for the functioning of the protein machinery carried by biomembranes ) .",
    "geometries of self - assembled interfaces : ( a ) micellar ( spheres ) , ( b ) hexagonal ( cylinders ) , ( c ) lamellar ( planes ) , ( d ) cubic bicontinuous ( cubic minimal surfaces ) and ( e ) disordered bicontinuous ( random surfaces ) . in amphiphilic systems ,",
    "mono- or bilayers are draped onto the mathematical surfaces .",
    "_ bicontinuous _ means that there is one surface which spans the whole sample , thereby separating it into two disjunct yet intertwined labyrinths ( like the corresponding surface , each labyrinth is connected and spans the whole sample ) . note that except for ( e ) , all surfaces are ordered and have constant mean curvature . ]    since the physics of amphiphilic systems is mostly determined by their interfaces , different geometries have comparable free energies and small changes in external variables can induce phase transitions . in",
    "particularly , for amphiphilic systems different geometries are stable for different values of concentrations and temperature . in order to achieve systematic control of amphiphilic systems , a large effort has been invested into experimentally determining the phase diagram for many important amphiphilic systems . it has been found that despite their molecular diversity , the phase behavior of amphiphilic systems follows some general rules which result from their intrinsic tendency for self - assembly into sheet - like structures . for example , for increasing amphiphile concentration one usually finds the generic phase sequence micellar disordered - micellar ordered - hexagonal - cubic bicontinuous - lamellar .",
    "_ micellar _ means spherical geometry ; _ micellar ordered _ corresponds to an ordered ( usually cubic ) array of spherical micelles .",
    "_ hexagonal _ denotes a two - dimensional packing of cylindrical aggregates .",
    "_ bicontinuous _ means that one surface partitions space into two separate labyrinths , each of which can be used to traverse space . _",
    "cubic bicontinuous _ corresponds to a space - filling arrangement of one interface , which folds onto itself in a cubic arrangement .",
    "sometimes non - cubic spacegroups are found , but most ordered bicontinuous structures in equilibrium are cubic . in some systems , bicontinuous yet disordered phases occur , which are called _ sponge phases _ and _ microemulsions _ for binary and ternary systems , respectively . _",
    "lamellar _ corresponds to a one - dimensional stack of interfaces .",
    "ordered arrangements like hexagonal or cubic symmetries can be probed by scattering techniques , and bicontinuity by diffusion experiments ( e.g.  using nuclear magnetic resonance ) . tries to visualize the different interface geometries .",
    "it is the case of cubic bicontinuous phases which is the main focus of this paper .",
    "there exists a large body of literature on the occurrence of bicontinuous phases in amphiphilic systems ( for reviews see @xcite ) . in",
    "we show experimental phase diagrams for binary @xcite and ternary @xcite systems with the small surfactant @xmath5 ( this is the molecule shown in a ) . for the binary system ,",
    "a , at low temperature one sees the sequence hexagonal @xmath7 - cubic bicontinuous @xmath8 - lamellar @xmath9 with increasing amphiphile concentration .",
    "for high temperature , the hexagonal and cubic bicontinuous phases disappear , the lamellar phase @xmath9 expands ( its interfaces unbind ) , and for very small amphiphile concentration a sponge phase @xmath10 occurs . for the ternary system ,",
    "b , we recognize the same situation again close to the binary side water - amphiphile . for equal amounts of water and oil and not too large concentration of amphiphile ,",
    "that is in the lower middle of the gibbs triangle , one sees the following phase behavior : at low temperature an emulsification failure occurs , that is the micellar disordered phase @xmath11 coexists with an oily excess phase . at high temperature ,",
    "the emulsification failure disappears and is replaced by a microemulsion ( the central , triangular one phase region ) .",
    "we can conclude that at low temperature , strongly curved structures prevail ( @xmath7 , @xmath11 ) , while at high temperature , those structures become stable which are locally flat ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , microemulsion ) . as we will show below , this behavior can be understood using the concept of a temperature dependent spontaneous curvature : spontaneous curvature is finite at low temperature , but vanishes at high temperature .",
    "the concept of finite spontaneous curvature also offers a natural explanation for the emulsification failure at low temperature . as we will argue below",
    ", the cubic bicontinuous phase @xmath8 is an intermediate structure between strongly curved and locally flat .",
    "it also follows from the phase behavior described that at low temperature , stable phases tend to be ordered ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , while disordered phases profit from increased temperature ( @xmath10 , microemulsion ) .",
    "we will discuss below that the disordered phases indeed have a larger configurational entropy . in this respect",
    ", it is the lamellar phase @xmath9 which acts as an intermediate structure .    experimentally determined phase behavior for the surfactant @xmath5 : binary system ( @xmath12 ) @xcite ( top ) and ternary system ( @xmath13 ) @xcite ( bottom ) . in the binary system , the hexagonal phase @xmath7 , the cubic bicontinuous phase @xmath8 , the lamellar phase @xmath9 , the sponge phase @xmath10 and the micellar phases @xmath11 and @xmath14 are stable . in the ternary system ,",
    "the same phases occur close to the binary side @xmath15 . at @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    ", @xmath11 coexists with excess oil ( emulsification failure ) . at @xmath18 ( balanced temperature ) ,",
    "a bicontinuous microemulsion is stable in the middle of the gibbs triangle . ]    in we show experimental phase diagrams for two different lipid - water mixtures .",
    "a is for water and 2:1 lauric acid / dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine @xcite and b for water and monoolein @xcite ( these are the molecules shown in b - d ) . despite the molecular differences , the macroscopic phase behavior is surprisingly similar . at low temperature",
    "the membranes loose their fluidity . at intermediate temperatures ,",
    "the lamellar phase is stable , and at high temperatures , it is replaced by the hexagonal phase .",
    "whereas in the case of the surfactant @xmath5 spontaneous curvature is finite at ambient temperatures and vanishes at high temperature , for the lipids spontaneous curvature vanishes at ambient temperatures and increases with temperature .",
    "several cubic bicontinuous phases are stable for intermediate temperatures , in the sequence lamellar - g - d - p ( here g , d and p stand for cubic bicontinuous structures which are discussed in more detail below ) with increasing water content .",
    "the last phase in this sequence undergoes an emulsification failure , that is it coexists with an excess water phase",
    ". we will show below that this phase behavior can be explained nicely if the lipid monolayers of the cubic bicontinuous phases are modeled as parallel surfaces to a cubic minimal midsurface .",
    "experimentally determined phase behavior for lipid - water mixtures : 2:1 lauric acid / dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine @xcite ( top ) and monoolein @xcite ( bottom ) . in both phase diagrams",
    ", one sees the sequence lamellar - cubic bicontinuous - excess water ( emulsification failure ) at intermediate temperatures ( around @xmath19 ) and with increasing water concentration . in ( a ) , g , d and p are stable . in ( b ) , g ( ia3d ) and d ( pn3 m ) are stable . ]    in this article , we focus on the interface description of amphiphilic systems , that is the free energy of the system is written as a functional of its interface configuration .",
    "the interface free energy is introduced in the next section ( ) , and in the rest of this article we will specify this free energy expression for different instances of cubic bicontinuous phases . in each case , we will discuss the relevant geometric properties and show how they relate to the resulting free energy expressions and phase diagrams .",
    "our starting point are _ triply periodic minimal surfaces _",
    "( tpms ) in , a subject well - known from differential geometry .",
    "these structures are expected to occur if the amphiphilic interface is symmetric in regard to its two sides and if temperature is not too high as to destroy the ordered state .",
    "tpms are also the reference state for their parallel surfaces and cmc - companions , which are the adequate structural models for a detailed analysis of amphiphilic monolayers in cubic bicontinuous phases . in the case",
    "that the physical interface is not symmetric in regard to its two sides ( that is if spontaneous curvature exists , like usually for an amphiphilic monolayer at a water - oil interface ) , the relevant mathematical representations are the constant mean curvature companions of the tpms , that is _ triply periodic surfaces of constant mean curvature _ ( cmc - surfaces ) treated in .",
    "the case of lipid bilayers might be considered to be the composition of two such cmc - surfaces , but we will argue in that in this case the relevant geometry is in fact the one of _",
    "parallel surfaces _ to a tpms . in all of these cases",
    ", we are interested in ordered structures , and therefore the main method will be minimization of the corresponding free energy functionals .",
    "this is different in , where we will discuss disordered bicontinuous phases , that is the sponge phases and microemulsions , which often occur at higher temperatures due to entropic effects .",
    "these structures are modeled as _",
    "random surfaces _ , thus the main model here will be gibbs distributions , in particular the theory of gaussian random fields and monte carlo simulations .",
    "from the viewpoint of elasticity theory , amphiphilic interfaces with small curvatures can be considered to be thin elastic shells , which are known to have few fundamental modes of deformation : out - of - plane bending , in - plane compression and in - plane shearing @xcite . however , since amphiphilic interfaces are fluid and nearly incompressible , in - plane strain is irrelevant and the most relevant deformation mode is bending . for small curvatures",
    "the free energy of an amphiphilic interface is a function only of its geometry @xcite : @xmath20 here @xmath21 denotes the differential area element and @xmath22 and @xmath23 mean and gaussian curvature , respectively .",
    "the latter two follow from the two principal curvatures @xmath24 and @xmath25 as @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the three material parameters introduced in define the energy scales of the corresponding changes : @xmath28 is _ surface tension _ and corresponds to changes in surface area , @xmath29 is _ bending rigidity _ and corresponds to cylindrical bending , and @xmath30 is _ saddle - splay modulus _ ( or _ gaussian bending rigidity _ ) and corresponds to changes in topology due to the gauss - bonnet - theorem for closed surfaces , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes euler characteristic .",
    "the _ spontaneous curvature _ defines the reference point for bending deformations .",
    "it has to vanish for symmetric amphiphilic sheets ( like lipid bilayers ) , but in general is finite for non - symmetric ones ( like monolayers ) . for monolayers ,",
    "it is usually a linear function of temperature , @xmath33 .",
    "therefore spontaneous curvature vanishes at the balanced temperature @xmath34 , at which solvent properties make the monolayer symmetric in regard to bending .    for amphiphilic interfaces ,",
    "surface area is proportional to the number of amphiphilic molecules , thus @xmath28 can also be interpreted as a chemical potential for amphiphiles . the bending rigidity @xmath29 has to be positive ,",
    "otherwise the system would become instable to spontaneous convolutions . for surfactant and lipid systems ,",
    "its values are of the order of 1 and 20 @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "surface tension @xmath28 can assume negative values ( favorable chemical potential for the influx of amphiphiles ) , as long as bending rigidity @xmath29 exists and has a positive value , in order to prevent an instability towards proliferation of interfacial area .",
    "the value of the saddle - splay modulus @xmath30 is often debated , but usually it is assumed to have a small negative value .",
    "this assumption is validated by the following argument @xcite : for @xmath36 and @xmath37 , we can rewrite as @xmath38 with @xmath39 from this we conclude that the gaussian bending rigidity has to satisfy @xmath40 and @xmath41 , that is @xmath42 , otherwise the system would become unstable . for @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) , we would get @xmath45 , that is many small droplets , and for @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , we would get @xmath48 , that is a minimal surface with very small lattice constant .    from the mathematical point of view , it is interesting that for @xmath36 and @xmath49 , the bending energy from is not only invariant under rescaling with length , but also invariant under conformal transformations in general .",
    "this has intriguing consequences for vesicles @xcite ( vesicles are depicted in , but are not subject of this article ) and phase transitions in systems without spontaneous curvature ( as will be discussed in ) .",
    "since the energy scales involved are of the order of @xmath35 , thermal noise is sufficient to induce shape changes . due to thermal fluctuations on smaller length scales , the effective values for the material parameters",
    "are changed ( renormalized ) at larger length scales @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in the framework of renormalization group theory that logarithmic corrections arise due the two - dimensional nature of the amphiphilic interfaces , so that @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the length scale on which the system is analyzed and @xmath52 is a microscopic cutoff on the scale of the membrane thickness . thus bending rigidity decreases , while gaussian bending rigidity increases with increasing length scale @xmath51 .    for the following , it is useful to introduce two dimensionless quantities which correspond to the two curvatures of a two - dimensional surface . for a structure with surface area @xmath53 and volume @xmath54 , the length scale @xmath55 can be used to rescale its curvatures . in order to be able to convert easily from local to global quantities",
    ", we consider a triply periodic cmc - surface with euler characteristic @xmath32 and integrated mean curvature @xmath56 per conventional ( that is simple cubic ) unit cell : @xmath57 these expressions motivate the definition of the _ topology index _ @xmath58 and the _ curvature index _",
    "@xmath59 : @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the scaled surface area and the scaled integral mean curvature per conventional unit cell , respectively .",
    "note that these definitions can be applied to any triply periodic surface ; here we used cmc - surfaces only for an heuristic motivation of the quantities defined .",
    "both the topology index @xmath58 and the curvature index @xmath59 do not depend on scaling and choice of unit cell .",
    "they are universal geometrical quantities which characterize a surface in three - dimensional space .",
    "the topology index describes its porosity ( the larger its value , the less holes the structure has ) and its specific area content ( the larger its value , the more inner surface the structure contains ) , and the curvature index describes how strongly the structure is curved ( irrespective of the actual lattice constant ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the two indices defined here correspond to the two isoperimetric ratios known from integral geometry . for a tpms",
    ", the curvature index @xmath59 vanishes and the topology index @xmath58 is its most important geometric characteristic .",
    "a different but equally powerful approach to amphiphilic interfaces is the isosurface construction ( also known as phase field method ) , which derives a two - dimensional surface from a three - dimensional scalar field @xmath63 . for ternary amphiphilic systems ,",
    "@xmath63 can be interpreted as the local concentration difference between water ( @xmath64 ) and oil ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the position of the amphiphilic monolayer can be identified with the isosurface @xmath66 . for binary amphiphilic systems ,",
    "@xmath63 can be interpreted as the local concentration difference between water on different sides of a bilayer , and the isosurface @xmath66 marks the position of the bilayer mid - surface . in both cases ,",
    "an energy functional can be defined in the spirit of a ginzburg - landau theory for the scalar field @xmath63 .",
    "a reasonable choice is the @xmath67-model introduced by gompper and schick @xcite : @xmath68 = \\int\\ d\\textbf{r}\\ \\left\\ { ( \\delta \\phi)^{2 } + g(\\phi ) ( \\nabla \\phi)^{2 } + f(\\phi ) \\right\\}\\\\ ] ] with the following choice for @xmath69 and @xmath70 : @xmath71 it has been shown that this model is similar to an interface description as given in , and prescriptions have been given how to calculate the parameters of the interface hamiltonian from the given ginzburg - landau theory @xcite . due to the invariance under @xmath72 ,",
    "spontaneous curvature @xmath73 vanishes in this model . for given model parameters",
    "@xmath74 , this energy functional can be minimized for its spatial degrees of freedom , and a phase diagram can be calculated as a function of model parameters by identifying the absolute minimum at every point .",
    "a reasonable choice for amphiphilic systems is @xmath75 , @xmath76 close to @xmath77 and @xmath78 not too large .",
    "then the formation of interfaces is favored and a lamellar phase becomes stable .",
    "calculation of the corresponding parameters of the interface model then yields @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "note that @xmath82 favors the formation of interfaces , and that @xmath81 favors the lamellar phase .",
    "minimal surfaces and surfaces of constant mean curvature ( see ) in general have attracted a lot of attention both in mathematics and in physics , partially due to their intrinsic beauty , which might be considered to follow from the fact that they are solutions to variational problems @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the different fields are interested in different aspects of the same object : while for mathematicians the most central question is the existence proof for a minimal surface of interest , physicists are more interested in its representation , which can be used to derive physical properties of corresponding material systems . as karcher and polthier remark ,",
    "outside mathematics only pictured minimal surfaces have been accepted as existent @xcite .",
    "in fact this statement can also be reversed : not every structure which one can picture is necessarily a minimal surface . in this article",
    "we consider only established minimal surfaces .",
    "as we are motivated by physical considerations , we are interested only in embedded surfaces which do not self - intersect . in regard to mathematics",
    ", our main emphasis here will be on representations , since the physical properties of amphiphilic systems follow from their spatial structure .",
    "minimal surfaces are surfaces with @xmath83 everywhere .",
    "if one varies a surface with a normal displacement @xmath84 ( where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the internal coordinates of the surface ) , it can be shown that the change in surface area is @xmath87 @xcite , that is a minimal surface is a stationary surface for variations of surface area .",
    "therefore surfaces under surface tension ( like soap films ) , which try to minimize surface area , form minimal surfaces . here",
    "we consider surfaces which are dominated by bending rigidity rather than by surface tension .",
    "however , for vanishing spontaneous curvature the resulting structures also correspond to minimal surfaces . explains why : these surfaces have to minimize @xmath88 ( they are so - called _ willmore surfaces _ ) , and minimal surfaces are a special case of willmore surfaces , since @xmath83 is a trivial minimization of this functional .",
    "if mean curvature @xmath89 , then gaussian curvature @xmath90 .",
    "thus minimal surfaces are everywhere either saddle - like or flat , and nowhere convex .",
    "in fact it can be shown that the flat points with @xmath91 are isolated .",
    "moreover it follows from @xmath92 that minimal surfaces without boundaries can not be compact @xcite . until 1983",
    ", only two embedded minimal surfaces were known which are non - periodic : the plane and the catenoid .",
    "then a new surface of this type was found , the costa - surfaces , which from the distance looks like the union of a plane and a catenoid @xcite .",
    "today some more surfaces of this type are known , but the majority of all embedded minimal surfaces without boundaries are in fact periodic .",
    "there is only one simply - periodic minimal surface , the helicoid , and there are some doubly - periodic surfaces , with the scherk - surface being most prominent .",
    "the majority of all known periodic minimal surfaces is triply - periodic . here",
    "we will focus on cubic minimal surfaces and their physical realizations , which are cubic bicontinuous structures .",
    "visualizations of 10 different cubic minimal surfaces .",
    "every triply periodic surface divides space into two labyrinths , which in some cases are represented here by skeletal graphs .",
    "d and g are the basis for the double - diamond structure and the gyroid , respectively , which often occur in physical systems . ]    the best known triply periodic minimal surface ( tpms ) is the p - surface found by schwarz in 1867 and depicted in d. schwarz and his students found 5 tpms , including the cubic cases p , c(p ) and d. until 1970 no more examples were found , then schoen described 13 more @xcite , including the cubic cases g , f - rd , i - wp , o , c - to and c(d ) .",
    "he proved the existence of g by providing an explicit ( weierstrass ) representation , and the existence of the others was proven in 1989 by karcher @xcite .",
    "more tpms have been discovered by fischer and koch @xcite and others , and today many more can be generated by making controlled modifications to computer models of known tpms , a method which was pioneered by polthier and karcher @xcite . however , these surfaces tend to be rather complicated , and we will show below that only the simple ( as quantified by the topology index ) tpms are relevant for amphiphilic systems . in",
    "we show visualizations of 10 different tpms with cubic symmetry .",
    "there representations have been obtained from the @xmath67-ginzburg - landau theory as will be explained below .",
    "for some of these structures , we also show line - like representations of the two labyrinths defined by the surface ( _ skeletal graphs _ ) .",

    "we conclude that the experimental system should correspond to a rather large value of @xmath124 .",
    "earlier work moreover suggests that incorporation of thermal fluctuations would favor micellar phases near the water - amphiphilic side and lamellar phases near the water apex @xcite .",

    "the acceptance of both the bond - flip and topology - change moves is determined by the boltzmann weight and is therefore controlled by the curvature energy .",
    "we want to mention parenthetically that some care has to be taken to find a good discretization of the bending energy @xcite .    a typical configuration of a triangulated surface in a cubic box with parameters @xmath29 , @xmath208 and @xmath184 chosen in the stability region of the microemulsion or sponge phase is shown in fig .  [ fig : sponge_config ] .",
    "this configuration nicely demonstrates the bicontinuous structure of balanced microemulsions and sponge phases .",
    "the saddle - like geometry of the membrane can also be easily seen .",
    "finally , the figure shows that _ locally _ the structure of the sponge phase strongly resembles the cubic phases discussed above .",
    "therefore , a sponge phase should indeed be considered as the molten state of the crystalline cubic phase .    a typical membrane configuration in a sponge phase for bending rigidity @xmath255 .",

    "this dependence of the osmotic pressure is indeed nicely confirmed by the simulation data @xcite .",
    "the simulations therefore provide strong evidence for the renormalization of the elastic moduli of the curvature model and for the dependence ( [ eq : free_energy_renorm ] ) of the free energy on the membrane volume fraction .    the phase diagram for fixed bending rigidity @xmath29",

    "the simulation data are compared with the prediction ( [ eq : sponge_stability ] ) for the phase boundary .",
    "since the slopes of the phase boundaries in this logarithmic plot agree very well , not only the exponential dependence of the membrane volume fraction at the transition on the saddle splay modulus is confirmed , but also the value of the universal prefactor in eq .",

    "qualitatively , the agreement with the theoretical approaches is very reasonable .",
    "for example , the scattering curve in bulk contrast shows a peak at non - zero wave vector in the microemulsion phase , which moves out and decreases in height with increasing surfactant concentration . a quantitative comparison , however , is much more difficult .",
    "we want to discuss here three different classes of experiments , where a such a quantitative comparison has been made .",
    "the first type of experiments are scattering studies in bulk and film contrast . in bulk contrast , the scattering intensity @xmath258 is proportional to the spectral density @xmath187 of the gaussian random field model , compare eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectral ] ) , for wave vectors @xmath259 which are not much larger than the characteristic wave vector @xmath260 of the domain structure , compare eq .",
    "( [ eq : char_wavevect ] ) . the functional dependence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectral ] ) describes the scattering data in this regime very well , as was first noted by teubner and strey @xcite , who derived this result on the basis of a ginzburg - landau model , very similar to that introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : landau ] .",
    "we want to mention parenthetically , that for wave vectors @xmath261 , the intensity is dominated by the scattering from sharp , planar interfaces ; in this limit , the famous porod law @xcite predicts @xmath262 .    in the limit of wave vector @xmath263 ,",
    "the scattering intensity in film contrast is given by @xcite @xmath264 where @xmath256 is the osmotic pressure of eq .",
    "( [ eq : osmotic_press ] ) . for the free energy ( [ eq : free_energy_renorm ] ) , this implies @xmath265^{-1 } \\sim const + \\ln\\psi\\ ] ] such a behavior has indeed be observed experimentally in ref .",
    "however , this result has been questioned by daicic et al .",
    "this has lead to a intensive debate , with arguments against @xcite and in favor @xcite of the existence of a logarithmic renormalization of elastic moduli in the sponge phase .    in a second type of experiment , information about the average geometry of the surfactant film",
    "can be extracted from the scattering intensity in the regime @xmath266 .",
    "this information is contained in the corrections to the asymptotic @xmath267 law for smaller values of the wave vector @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the average gaussian curvature is found to be @xcite @xmath268 which is in excellent agreement with the gaussian random field result @xmath269 and simulations of the @xmath67-ginzburg - landau model @xcite .",
    "the third type of experiment concerns the phase behavior of mixtures of water and non - ionic surfactant as a function of temperature and surfactant concentration . as mentioned in ,",
    "the saddle - splay modulus @xmath208 is a linear function of temperature in this case .",
    "therefore , the concentrations at the phase boundaries of the lamellar and the sponge phase are expected from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sponge_stability ] ) to depend exponentially on temperature . a logarithmic plot of the phase diagram of @xmath270 in water @xcite , compare fig .",
    "[ fig : phasebehavior1 ] , is indeed consistent with this expectation .",
    "the most detailed information about both the scattering intensities and phase behavior in these systems has been obtained very recently in ternary amphiphilic systems of water , oil and non - ionic surfactant @xmath271 , to which small traces of an amphiphilic block copolymer has been added @xcite .",
    "the results obtained in this system provide further , strong evidence for the existence of a logarithmic renormalization of @xmath29 and @xmath208 in microemulsions and sponge phases .",
    "in this contribution we discussed the geometrical properties of surfaces which can be used as structural models for cubic bicontinuous phases in amphiphilic systems : triply periodic minimal surfaces , their parallel surfaces and constant mean curvature companions , and bicontinuous random surfaces . for each class of surfaces",
    ", we showed how the geometrical properties translate into physical properties of bicontinuous phases in amphiphilic systems in the framework of an interfacial description .",
    "the surprising success of this approach relates to the fact that in amphiphilic systems , the solvent has little physical properties by itself and the free energy is essentially determined by the interfaces .",
    "although there are several physical effects which have been neglected in our treatment of amphiphilic systems , including van der waals and electrostatic interactions , it can be concluded that the most essential aspects of phase behavior are now well understood in terms of the properties of the underlying geometries .    during the last years",
    ", the interest in bicontinuous phases has increased due to some promising applications in the nano- and biosciences .",
    "for example , amphiphilic self - assembly has been used to synthesize _ mesoporous systems _",
    "@xcite , that is porous material with amorphous walls ( usually silica - based ) and pore sizes on the nanometer scale . as a matter of fact , the combination of amphiphilic self - assembly and crystallization also seems to be a basic aspect of biomineralization @xcite , and there are many algae whose mineral skeletons look similar to cubic bicontinuous phases @xcite .",
    "there is also a large effort underway to synthesize bicontinuous structures from graphitic material ( _ schwarzites _ ) , which offers the advantage of atomically smooth walls @xcite .",
    "porous material on the nanometer scale is not only interesting for its structural properties ( for example use as sieves or catalysts ) , but also for its electronic properties ( for example use as photonic bandgap material ) .    in the biosciences , two recent developments involved cubic bicontinuous phases .",
    "it was found that the gyroid phase in the monoolein - water system provides a functional environment for the crystallization of integral membrane proteins like bacteriorhodopsin @xcite .",
    "membrane proteins are notoriously difficult to crystallize in a three - dimensional array , which however is necessary for structure determination by x - ray scattering . and",
    "an extensive analysis of transmission electron micrographs of many biological specimen has shown that cubic bicontinuous structures are locally formed in several regions of the cells @xcite , including endoplasmatic reticulum , golgi apparatus and mitochondria . these are extended lipid bilayer systems in the cell which carry a protein machinery responsible for processing and packaging material inside the cell .",
    "in fact it is easy to imagine that biological cells regulate their lipid composition and therefore their spontaneous curvature as to achieve geometries favorable for the task at hand . in general ,",
    "cubic bicontinuous phases seem to be ideal space partitioners if a large amount of active surface area is needed while simultaneously providing good access for incoming and outgoing material through the space away from the interface .",
    "what problems are left regarding the subjects of this article ? from the viewpoint of mathematics , there are two interesting aspects . on the one hand , the physical motivation leads to certain variational problems for which little is known about the corresponding solutions .",
    "one example is the energy functional @xmath272 with a volume constraint ; in principle this problem was subject of , but in lack of adequate mathematical knowledge ( this problem has been treated for vesicles @xcite , but not for bicontinuous structures ) , we used cmc - surfaces as structural models . on the other hand ,",
    "some classes of surfaces are well investigated , but still representations are missing which could be used in physical modelling .",
    "therefore additional progress in regard to weierstrass representations for tpms , weierstrass - like representations for their cmc - companions , and other ( numerical ) representations would be most welcome . with a larger repertoire of representations , it should also become easier to treat non - local effects like van der waals and electrostatic interactions ; here integral geometry might be helpful in reducing the dimensions of the corresponding integrals , and sophisticated summation techniques are needed to account for the infinite extension of the bulk phases .    from the viewpoint of material sciences , it seems worth to study the role of boundaries and inclusions .",
    "the term _ boundaries _ includes grain boundaries between different , yet adjacent phases , for example between a hexagonal and a gyroid phase ; until now , this problem has been investigated only for simple geometries .",
    "it also includes the boundary to an external surface ( which might even be curved or chemically structured ) and free boundaries .",
    "for example , it has been recently observed experimentally that the bicontinuous cubic phase in the binary system water - @xmath273 is the only known material system which shows crystal faces with high miller indices ( _ devil s staircase _ ) @xcite .",
    "the term _ inclusions _ includes several object of biological and technological relevance , in particular integral membrane proteins , polymers anchored in the membrane and ( functionalized ) nanoparticles . in all of these cases , the framework described here should provide a good starting point for future research , which has to bridge the gap between the mathematical knowledge on the geometrical properties and the physics knowledge of the material basis of these fascinating structures .",
