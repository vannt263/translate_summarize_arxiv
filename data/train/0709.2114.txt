    "bell s theorem was originally introduced @xcite to examine quantitatively the consequences of postulating hidden variable distributions on the incompleteness of quantum mechanics put forward by einstein , podolsky and rosen @xcite ( epr ) . in particular , the hidden variables were supposed to locally and causally complete quantum mechanics by making sense of the reality of physical quantities described by non - commuting operators relative to two spatially separated particles in an entangled state .",
    "bell showed that a correlation function obtained from averages over the hidden variables of these physical quantities must satisfy certain inequalities ( the bell inequalities ) , and that these inequalities are violated by quantum mechanical averages . given that experiments have confirmed with increasing precision the correctness of the quantum formalism , it is generally stated that the violation of the bell inequalities contradicts locality .",
    "the strong version of such statements asserts that quantum mechanics itself is non - local @xcite .",
    "this vocable is quite popular ( in particular among non - specialists as well as in quantum information papers ) but there is a general agreement among most specialists that this strong assertion is unsubstantiated @xcite .",
    "instead , the received view is the weak version following which bell s theorem asserts the incompatibility of local hidden variables with quantum mechanics .",
    "nevertheless it can objected , in principle @xcite or through abstract models @xcite , whether the assumptions made in order to derive bell s theorem are necessary in order to enforce locality , or whether they only rule out a certain manner of ascribing local variables to the measurement outcomes .    in this work",
    "we will show that statistical distributions in classical mechanics can violate bell - type inequalities . moreover the statistical distributions we will employ are not exotic objects but the _ classical analogues _ of the quantum - mechanical coupled angular momenta eigenstates , so that our model is essentially the classical version of the paradigmatic 2-particles singlet state .",
    "the violation of the inequalities can of course be achieved only provided the model falls outside the assumptions necessary in order to prove bell s theorem .",
    "this role will be played by a probabilistic interaction that is assumed to take place between the measured particle and the detector , combined with the requirement that the total angular momentum be conserved .",
    "although this interaction is local , it nevertheless spoils the derivation of bell s theorem , because it introduces an ensemble dependency of the outcomes : the resulting averages then involve correlations given by conditional probabilities between ensembles rather than between the individual phase - space positions . as a consequence ,",
    "the different expectation values employed in bell s inequalities can not be derived jointly , as required in the derivation of the theorem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we will start by introducing the classical phase - space distributions ( sec .",
    "ii ) , first for a single particle , then for 2 particles with total zero angular momentum .",
    "we will explain why these distributions are the classical analogues of the quantum angular momentum eigenstates . in sec .",
    "iii we will investigate three different examples of bell - type models .",
    "each of the examples will be characterized by the same phase - space distribution but by differing detection schemes .  in the first case , the projections of the angular momentum of each of the particles along arbitrary axes",
    "are directly measured by the detectors , leading to a straightforward application of bell s theorem ( which will be briefly derived ) . in the second example",
    "the detectors yield discrete outcomes , depending on the values of the angular momenta ; this example , which also abides by bell s theorem , will allow us to introduce conditional probabilities to account for the correlated angular momenta .",
    "the third example will illustrate the same situation with stochastic variables ( the angular momenta specify probabilities of obtaining an outcome ) . in sec .",
    "iv , we will introduce an example falling outside the class of bell - type models.this example will also involve discrete measurement outcomes , but the presence of an interaction leading to ensemble dependencies will be introduced .",
    "we will see that ensemble dependencies lead to non - commutative measurements for a single particle , and to the violation of the bell inequalities for initially correlated two - particle systems . in sec . v we will discuss these results , insisting on the role played by the existence of joint distributions and on the relationship between locality and conservation laws .",
    "a short summary and our conclusion are given in sec .",

    "iv ) that correlation functions obtained from 2-particle distributions in classical mechanics can lead to a violation of the bell inequalities , without nonlocality being explicitly involved ( it may play an implicit role , see sec .",
    "c below ) . the main difference between this model and the other examples we have given consists in the ensemble dependencies : probabilities , average values and conservation laws are relative to a collective property ( a given distribution ) and do not depend , as in the other cases , on the individual phase - space positions .",
    "indeed , the constraint ( [ 50 ] ) cuts the link between a definite phase - space position of a particle and a given measurement outcome ( be it in a probabilistic or deterministic way ) .    in this respect , it is noteworthy to compare the interpretation of the conditional probabilities appearing in examples 2 ( sec .",

    "iii.d , only brings in several combinations of possible outcomes allowed by the definite positions of @xmath49 and @xmath222 on the angular momentum sphere , but still allows to correlate these individual positions with measurement outcomes .",
    "we had remarked in sec .",
    "iii.b that the existence of a joint probability @xmath113 is sufficient to ensure that a bell - type inequality holds , irrespective of whether the assumption that measurement outcomes and probabilities depend on the individual phase space positions is made .",
    "but if that specific assumption is made , then one is lead to the existence of a joint probability by imposing the factorization ( [ w1 ] ) .",
    "along these lines , there are two ways of seeing why bell s theorem does not apply to our fourth example .    first",
    ", the ensemble dependence can formally be thought of as arising from elementary phase - space probability functions _ specific _ to a given ensemble , i.e.@xmath266 ( compare with eq .",
    "( [ w6 ] ) ) . by employing expressions such as eq .",
    "( [ e56 ] ) in the expectation value as given by eqs .",
    "( [ e38])-([e39 ] ) , it can be seen directly that the ensemble dependence of the elementary probabilities spoils the factorization ( [ w1 ] )  for example instead of @xmath267 one has outcome dependent expressions such as @xmath268 .",
    "the second manner starts with the remark made above concerning the non - commutation of the @xmath269 measurements introduced in our model ; in classical mechanics , measurements usually commute , but this is not the case if they arise from collective phenomena ( encapsulated in the ensemble dependency ) . by requiring that the angular momentum be conserved between ensembles ( just as it is when individual positions are considered ) , the consequences of the non - commutation are carried over from one particle to the other . as seen in sec .",
    "[ mc ] in the single particle case , the probabilities and outcomes when @xmath183 is measured after a first measurement is made will be different depending on whether @xmath176 or @xmath211 was measured first . because eq .",
    "( [ 33 ] ) links the outcomes with the ensembles , this is also the case in the two - particle problem when @xmath203 ( or @xmath270 ) is determined after @xmath176 _ or _",
    "@xmath211 were measured .",
    "put differently , although eq .",
    "( [ 33 ] ) holds for the @xmath28 , @xmath75 , @xmath45 and @xmath76 axes , it can not hold jointly for all the axes because the single particle ensembles @xmath231 and @xmath271 are mutually exclusive , as well as @xmath272 and @xmath273 ( see sec .",
    "ii and sec .",
    "hence a joint probability @xmath113 can not be defined and the model is not constrained by the inequality ( [ i1 ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the equivalence @xcite shown between the verification of bell s inequality and the commutation of the four observables entering eq .",
    "( [ e60 ] ) .",
    "the ensemble - dependence introduced in our model appears as a tool in order to enforce , in a classical context , the non - commutation of the measurements along different axes made on the same particle .",
    "factorization , enforcing the existence of joint distributions , and as such a necessary assumption in the derivation of bell s theorem , is usually argued to be intimately linked to locality . according to bell @xcite ,",
    "factorization is a _ consequence _ of local causality , given that space - like separated events can only have common causes in their backward light - cone : therefore the probability of obtaining a certain result in an event regarding one of the particles can not depend on what has been measured on the other .",
    "it is known however that factorization can be seen @xcite as a consequence of two separate conditions , outcome independence ( the conditional probability of one event does not depend on the outcome obtained in the other event ) and parameter independence ( dependence on the measurement direction of the other event ) . only the violation of outcome independence can result in a genuine violation of local causality ( it would permit superluminal signalling ) , whereas the violation of parameter independence allows a peaceful coexistence @xcite between local causality and other types of  correlations preventing the factorization .    the present model  like many quantum mechanical entangled systems  respects parameter independence [ eq . ( [ e31 ] ) ]",
    "but violates outcome independence [ eq .",
    "( [ 31b ] ) ] ( the dependencies here must be understood relative to the ensembles and not relative to the individual positions of the angular momenta ) .",
    "this outcome dependence of the conditional probabilities is due to the conservation of the angular momentum , as encapsulated by @xmath222 ( anti - correlation between individual positions ) , eq .",
    "( [ 33e ] ) ( correlation between ensembles occupying opposite hemispheres centered on the same arbitrary axis ) and eq .",
    "( [ 33 ] ) ( anti - correlation between the outcomes made on the same arbitrary axis ) .",
    "parameter independence on the other hand guarantees that the predictions relative to @xmath176 do not depend on what measurement or whether a measurement is carried out on particle 2 , and vice - versa [ eq@xmath274 [ e31 ] ) ] .",
    "it is clear nevertheless that the angular momentum conservation affects the distributions of both particles .",
    "for example if @xmath235 is given by eq .",
    "( [ 33c ] ) , made up from rotating distributions , measuring @xmath176 not only freezes the rotation of particle s 1 distribution , but also that of particle 2 ( precisely because the angular momenta are correlated and need to be conserved ) . if @xmath235 is taken as a uniform distribution on the sphere for the individually anti - correlated angular momenta , measuring @xmath176 changes the distribution @xmath220 but also @xmath275 .",
    "hence , it can be argued that the conservation of the angular momentum as implemented in our model actually results from an implicit implementation of nonlocality .",
    "there are several answers to this question , depending on the status one gives to conservations laws and ensemble distributions , or on how nonlocality or causality are defined .",
    "the three following positions can be singled out :    1 .   the changes in the distributions are real physical effects , but the conservation of the angular momentum results from a symmetry that is intrinsically linked to space - time . indeed the correlation ( [ 33 ] )",
    "arises by generalizing the angular momentum conservation for individual positions to ensembles accounting for non - commutative measurements .",
    "there is no need to invoke a specific mechanism for a conservation law ",
    "conservation laws and symmetry principles are just postulated .",
    "but if desired , a field can be can be ascribed the role of transporting the angular momentum ; in this respect , it may be useful to make the analogy with feynman s paradox in which mechanical angular momentum is transmitted between two charged particles through the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "2 .   the changes in the distributions are real physical effects due to a nonlocal form of causation .",
    "the requirement given by eq .",
    "( [ 33 ] ) is sufficient to imply nonlocality .",
    "action at a distance effects are quite common in non - relativistic classical mechanics , although the modern view is to ascribe such effects ( like gravity or several phenomena in electrostatics ) to the action of fields . here",
    "the nonlocal effect would consist in accounting for angular momentum conservation .",
    "this does not necessarily contradict the preceding position since it can be argued that symmetries can give rise to nonlocality , a position leading to a holistic vision of symmetries as holding beyond a space - time framework .",
    "3 .   the changes in the distributions are not physical effects : one must distinguish the observed frequencies ( which are measured ) from the calculus of probabilities ( whose role is to make logical inferences given a certain state of information @xcite ) .",
    "conditional probabilities do not therefore express causation and the factorization of the probabilities does not follow from the requirement of local causality .  in bell s term ,",
    "the variables entering the probabilities are not beables , an argument that may be supported by the fact that individual angular momenta positions do not ascribe values and that the status of ensembles as beables is questionable . the ensembles and their correlations are theoretical constructs encapsulating the state of knowledge we have of the situation , including the constraints ( like conservation laws ) .",
    "to summarize , we have first constructed classical distributions analogues of the quantum mechanical angular momentum eigenstates ; these classical distributions are characterized by being mutually exclusive , leading , with appropriate assumptions to non - commutative measurements .",
    "we have then derived bell s theorem in the deterministic and stochastic cases ; both cases are characterized by the fact that an individual position of the angular momentum ascribes a value ( with certainty or with a given probability ) to a measurement of the projection along any axis . as a result , a joint probability distribution for an arbitrary number of events can be defined .",
    "three different examples of bell - type models were studied .",
    "a non - bell - type model was introduced in sec .",
    "iv : in this model , individual positions of the angular momenta are irrelevant to determine the measurement outcomes , that only depend on ensembles.as a result , single particle measurements do not commute , and a distribution for joint measurements along different axes can not be defined .",
    "if it further assumed that the total angular momentum must be conserved , the bell inequalities are violated .",
    "the present results do not disprove bell s theorem  as we have seen , in these circumstances the assumptions made in the derivation of the theorem are not fulfilled .",
    "we have argued that the violation of the inequalities in our classical model is due to the conservation of the total angular momentum in the context of non - commutative measurements ; nonlocality does not need to be invoked ( although it may ) .  from this perspective",
    ", the violation of the bell inequalities would not constitute a marker of nonlocality .",
