    "the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) spacetime represents , in conformity with general relativity , the universe at very large scale , where it is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic @xcite . at the big bang ,",
    "it exhibits a singularity , considered a breakdown of general relativity @xcite .",
    "there the tensors involved in the einstein equations diverge .",
    "it was hoped that this problem is a consequence of the high symmetry of the flrw solution , and it disappears in real - life situations , but it turned out that is the norm , rather than the exception , as hawking s singularity theorem shows @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will see that , although einstein s equation in its standard form breaks down at the big bang singularity in the flrw model , it can be rewritten in a form which does nt break down : @xmath0 this form is equivalent to the standard form where the metric is not singular , but in addition extends smoothly at the singularities . like einstein s equation , this new equation is tensorial , but instead of being expressed in terms of the _ ricci tensor _ ( of second order ) , it involves _ the ricci part of the riemann curvature tensor _ ( of order @xmath1 ) .",
    "it is obtained by taking the kulkarni - nomizu product between einstein s equation and the metric tensor .",
    "the proposed new version of einstein s equation extends naturally and smoothly beyond the big bang singularity of the flrw model , and it is based solely on standard general relativity , without any modifications .    in section ",
    "[ s_flrw ] we review briefly the fact that in the flrw model , einstein s equation blows up . in ",
    "[ s_einstein_eq_expanded ] we introduce the expanded version of einstein s equation , which is equivalent to the latter at the points where the metric is nonsingular , but it is more general . section  [ s_beyond_big_bang ] contains the central result , a theorem showing that the new equation is smooth everywhere , including at the big bang singularity . section ",
    "[ s_properties ] discusses some properties of the proposed equation and solution .",
    "we conclude with some observations and implications in  [ s_conclusions ] .",
    "let @xmath2 be an interval representing the time , with the natural metric @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a three - dimensional riemannian space , so that at any moment of time @xmath5 the space is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a function of time .",
    "the flrw spacetime is @xmath8 , with the metric @xmath9 to model the homogeneity and isotropy conditions at large scale , one may take the riemannian three - manifold @xmath10 to be one of the homogeneous spaces @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "then the metric on @xmath10 is , in spherical coordinates @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 , for the @xmath17-sphere @xmath11 , the euclidean space @xmath12 , or hyperbolic space @xmath13 respectively .",
    "if the universe is filled with a fluid with mass density @xmath18 and pressure density @xmath19 , the stress - energy tensor is @xmath20 where @xmath21 .    the mass density @xmath18 is determined from @xmath22 by the _ friedmann equation _ @xmath23 and pressure density @xmath19 by the _ acceleration equation",
    "_ @xmath24 both these equations are consequence of the einstein equation with the stress - energy tensor from equation .    when @xmath25 , the metric becomes degenerate , as we can see from equation . in the same time , equations and imply that both @xmath26 and @xmath27 blow up .",
    "consequently , the stress - energy tensor blows up too .",
    "but the expanded stress - energy tensor @xmath28 is smooth , as it is the expanded einstein equation which we propose here .",
    "the einstein equation @xmath29 involves the stress - energy tensor @xmath30 of the matter , the _ cosmological constant _",
    "@xmath31 , and the constant @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the gravitational constant and the speed of light .",
    "the einstein tensor @xmath35 is obtained from the _ ricci curvature _ @xmath36 and the _ scalar curvature _ @xmath37 .",
    "the _ expanded einstein equation _ is @xmath38 where , for two symmetric bilinear forms @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 denotes the _ kulkarni - nomizu product_.    so long as the metric @xmath42 is nonsingular , the einstein equation and its expanded version are equivalent . but the expanded version remains nonsingular , and even smooth , in a wider rage of cases . in the example of the flrw spacetime , the metric becomes degenerate ( its determinant cancels ) , the einstein tensor @xmath43 becomes singular , but we will see that the kulkarni - nomizu product @xmath44 tends to @xmath45 and cancels the blow up of the einstein tensor .    explicitly , the expanded einstein equation can be rewritten as @xmath46 in terms of the _ scalar part _ @xmath47 and the _ semi - traceless part _ @xmath48 of the riemann curvature , where @xmath49 is the traceless part of the ricci curvature .",
    "these tensors are well - known from the ricci decomposition of the riemann curvature tensor : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the _ weyl curvature tensor _",
    "( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the equation is obtained from and from @xmath52 because @xmath53",
    "for the flrw metric , with @xmath7 a smooth function of time , the tensors @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are smooth , and consequently the expanded einstein equation is smooth too , even when @xmath57 .",
    "if we denote by @xmath58 , @xmath59 from equations , , and , we can see that the ricci tensor has the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are smooth functions .",
    "similarly , @xmath63 and there is a smooth function @xmath64 so that @xmath65    we need to check that @xmath66 is compensated in @xmath55 and @xmath56 , so that @xmath22 appears to a non - negative power .",
    "since the flrw metric is diagonal in the standard coordinates , each term in @xmath67 is of the form @xmath68 , with @xmath69 .",
    "this means that at least @xmath70 or @xmath71 holds , and from we conclude that @xmath68 contains @xmath22 at least to the power @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , the scalar part of the riemann curvature , @xmath55 , is smooth .    for the same reason ,",
    "the kulkarni - nomizu product between the metric tensor and the term @xmath73 from the expression of the ricci curvature is smooth .",
    "the only term from we have to check that is smoothened by the kulkarni - nomizu product with @xmath42 is @xmath74 .",
    "since @xmath75 and @xmath42 is diagonal , it follows that @xmath76 ( without summation ) .",
    "if @xmath71 ( @xmath70 is similar ) , then @xmath77 contains the needed @xmath78 . in the case",
    "when @xmath79 , @xmath80 is not necessarily smooth , but in the kulkarni - nomizu product it will appear only in terms of the form @xmath81 , with @xmath82 .",
    "hence , @xmath83 is smooth . from this and from the smoothness of @xmath55",
    ", it follows that @xmath56 is also smooth .",
    "one of the properties of the flrw metric is that it is conformally flat , that is , @xmath84 . from this",
    "it follows that @xmath85 is smooth too .",
    "the conservation of energy is usually put in the form @xmath86 which remains valid even when the volume @xmath87 .      it is known that if the metric tensor is regular , its covariant derivative vanishes , @xmath88 . for our solution , this is true so long as @xmath89 .",
    "but if @xmath90 , the metric is degenerate , and we have to check that @xmath88 .    the metric being diagonal , its christoffel symbols of the first kind , @xmath91 which do nt vanish are either of the form @xmath92 or , for @xmath69 , @xmath93 or @xmath94 consequently , the christoffel symbols of the second kind , @xmath95 are of the form @xmath96 or , for @xmath69 , @xmath97 or @xmath98 where @xmath99 means `` no summation over the repeated indices '' .",
    "it follows that the covariant derivative introduces in the worst case a division by @xmath78 .",
    "the covariant derivative of the metric tensor is @xmath100 obviously @xmath101 is smooth , because @xmath102 is smooth . from the other terms ,",
    "the only ones involving non - vanishing christoffel symbols are of the form @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 , without summation .",
    "whenever @xmath106 involves @xmath22 to a negative power , which can only be @xmath107 or @xmath72 , this is compensated by @xmath108 , which contains @xmath78 .",
    "it follows that the covariant derivative of the metric tensor is smooth , and by continuity is zero even when the metric becomes degenerate ( at @xmath57 ) : @xmath109      we will show that the riemann curvature tensor satisfies the bianchi identity @xmath110 given that it holds at all the points for which @xmath89 , where the metric is regular , it also holds by continuity at @xmath111 .",
    "but we need to check that the covariant derivatives @xmath112 are smooth , because if the bianchi identity would be between infinte values , there would be no continuity .",
    "since the weyl part of the riemann curvature @xmath113 in the flrw spacetime , and from the equations and , it follows that @xmath54 has the following form : @xmath114 where the functions @xmath115 and @xmath116 are smooth .",
    "let s denote by @xmath117 , @xmath118 , the metric on @xmath10 .",
    "then @xmath119 .",
    "given that our frame is comoving with the fluid , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 for all @xmath122 .",
    "the only terms @xmath123 which do nt vanish by containing @xmath121 are of the form @xmath124 .",
    "the covariant derivatives with respect to @xmath125 cancel one another in the bianchi identity under the permutation , because the index @xmath125 is repeated .",
    "so we check now those terms of the form @xmath126 , where @xmath127 .",
    "but @xmath128 , because only @xmath129 depends on the spacelike direction @xmath130 , and because the metric tensor is parallel .",
    "the terms @xmath131 can only be of the form @xmath132 , @xmath69 .",
    "since @xmath133 , it follows that the covariant derivatives with respect to @xmath122 vanish .",
    "we check now thosw with respect to @xmath125 .",
    "if either the index @xmath134 or @xmath135 is equal to @xmath125 , then the cyclic permutation involved in the bianchi identity vanishes .",
    "then the only remaining possibility is @xmath136 . but",
    "@xmath137 , which is smooth .",
    "hence , the bianchi identity makes sense even at the singularity @xmath57 .",
    "shortly after einstein proposed his field equation , hilbert and einstein provided a lagrangian formulation . the lagrangian density which leads to einstein s equation with matter given by @xmath138 and cosmological constant @xmath31 is @xmath139 in our case ,",
    "the scalar curvature is singular at @xmath140 .",
    "but this does nt affect the lagrangian density , since the density @xmath141 is smooth @xcite .",
    "given that our expanded einstein equation is equivalent to einstein s its solutions are extremals of the action given by .",
    "the new form of einstein s equation extends uniquely beyond the big bang singularity , as it is represented schematically in figure [ flrw - exp ] .",
    "an alternative solution was proposed in @xcite , where the einstein equation was replaced with a densitized version @xmath142 this version is expressed in terms of tensor densities of weight @xmath107 , which appear naturally from the lagrangean .",
    "singularities which are of the type studied here , having the riemann curvature tensor @xmath54 smooth , and admitting smooth ricci decomposition , are in fact more general . in @xcite the schwarzschild singularity is put in a form in which has these properities , by an appropriate coordinate change .",
    "this , and similar results on the reissner - nordstrm singularity @xcite suggests that we should reconsider the information loss @xcite .",
    "more general cosmological models , which are neither homogeneous nor isotropic , are studied in @xcite , and shown to admit a smooth ricci decomposition , and satisfy the weyl curvature hypothesis @xcite .",
    "implications suggesting to reconsider the the problem of quantization are presented in @xcite ."
