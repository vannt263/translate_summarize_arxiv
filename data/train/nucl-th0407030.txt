    "hadron formation in deep inelastic scattering off nuclei offers an ideal tool to study the space - time behavior of the hadronization process@xcite .",
    "depending on whether the struck quark hadronizes inside or outside the nucleus the observed hadron attenuation may be due to quark energy loss via induced gluon radiation@xcite and/or ( pre)hadronic final - state interactions fsi@xcite .",
    "based on the earlier work of ref .",
    "we have developed in refs .   and a method to describe high - energy photon and electron induced reactions on complex nuclei in the framework of a semi - classical buu transport model",
    ".    in the kinematic regime of the hermes experiment the virtual photon does not always couple directly to the quark inside the nucleon . depending on its energy @xmath5 and virtuality @xmath6",
    "it may also fluctuate into a vector meson or perturbatively branch into a quark - antiquark pair that subsequently scatters off the target .",
    "its elementary reaction with a bound nucleon is modeled using the event generator pythia@xcite .",
    "thereby we take into account nuclear effects like shadowing , fermi motion , pauli blocking and nuclear binding .",
    "the interaction of the photon with the nucleon leads to the excitation of hadronic strings that fragment into hadrons according to the lund mechanism@xcite .",
    "the lund model involves three timescales for the production of a hadron : the production proper time @xmath7 of the hadron s first constituent , the production proper time @xmath8 of the second constituent , and the formation proper time @xmath9 of the hadron . in the lund model",
    "the latter corresponds to the space - time point where the world lines of the two hadron constituents cross for the first time .",
    "the production time @xmath8 can be interpreted as the production time of a color neutral prehadron . for each hadron in a fragmentation process we extract these three proper times directly from the jetset fragmentation routines which are implemented in pythia .",
    "the reaction products are then propagated in the coupled channel transport model which allows for a probabilistic treatment of the fsi beyond simple absorption mechanisms .",
    "the elastic and inelastic fsi of the ( pre)hadrons with the nucleons inside the nucleus lead to the production of new particles and to a redistribution of energy and momentum .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : krjetset ] we show our results for the multiplicity ratio @xmath10 for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 for a @xmath11kr nucleus in comparison with the experimental hermes data@xcite . here",
    "@xmath12 denotes the number of hadrons with fractional energy @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the number of deep inelastically scattered positrons . for simplicity we set the cross sections of the prehadrons to their hadronic values .",
    "therefore @xmath15 is independent of the hadron formation time @xmath9 in our calculations .",
    "the solid line shows the result of a calculation where we used the lund time @xmath8 as the production proper time of the prehadrons .",
    "as one can see , this yields a too weak hadron attenuation .",
    "one has to reduce @xmath8 by a factor of 0.2 ( dotted line ) to get a reasonable agreement with experimental data .",
    "note that a satisfying agreement with experimental data is also achieved by using the lund time @xmath7 as the prehadron production time ( dashed line ) .",
    "according to the lund model the dramatic reduction of @xmath8 has to be interpreted as an _ increase _ of the string tension @xmath16 by an unreasonably large factor of about _ five _ in the nuclear medium . by using @xmath7 as the starting time of the fsi we account for the interaction of the nucleon debris with the nuclear medium right after the moment of the @xmath17 interaction .",
    "this effectively accounts for the interactions of the hadronic string that is produced in the dis and that may interact with a hadronic cross section right from the beginning@xcite . for a more extensive investigation of hadron attenuation in dis",
