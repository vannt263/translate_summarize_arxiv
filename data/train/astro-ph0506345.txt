    "numerical studies of structure formation with the collisionless cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario predict dark halos with steep central cusps ( e.g. , navarro , frenk & white 1996 , 1997 , hereafter nfw ) , whereas most of the rotation curves of dwarf galaxies and low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies suggest that their halos have constant density cores ( e.g. , marchesini et al .",
    "2002 ; de blok & bosma 2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "self - interacting dark matter ( sidm ) with cross sections per unit of mass in the range @xmath4@xmath5 @xmath3 g@xmath1 was proposed as a possible route to reduce the density cusp , as thermal conduction replaces the central cusp by a soft core ( spergel & steinhardt 2000 ) . a tight constraint on the cross section just under @xmath6 @xmath3 g@xmath1 has been derived by considering the formation of giant cluster arcs ( meneghetti et al .",
    "2001 ) and the size of the cores of galaxy clusters ( e.g. , arabadjis , bautz & garmire 2002 ; lewis , buote & stocke 2003 ; arabadjis & bautz 2004 ) .",
    "since this cross section is too small to produce galactic cores , it has been pointed out that a velocity dependent cross section might reduce the effects of self - interaction on cluster scales ( e.g. , firmani et al .",

    "constraints on the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 were obtained by requiring that dwarf galaxies observed today have yet to undergo core collapse and that dark halos must survive the heating from hot cluster halos ( gnedin & ostriker 2001 ; hennawi & ostriker 2002 ) .",
    "all these requirements are satisfied for a very narrow range of parameters @xmath11@xmath12 @xmath3 g@xmath1 and @xmath13@xmath12 . for cross sections within this suitable range ,",

    "low surface brightness galaxies are ideal to put upper limits on the strength of dark matter ( dm ) self - interaction at the low - velocity regime ( i.e.  relative velocities of @xmath0 km s@xmath1 ) . in contrast to relatively recently formed objects , like clusters of galaxies , that present unrelaxed mass distributions , lsb galaxies with high central densities may have the highest formation redshifts and , therefore , they have had almost a hubble time to soften their cusps . in the present study we concentrate on the implications of the halo of the lsb galaxy ngc 5963 for dark matter self - interaction . the high central density and",
    "the small core radius of the halo of ngc 5963 suggest that either the dm cross section , at the low velocity regime , is rather small @xmath17 @xmath3 g@xmath1 or the dark halo is undergoing an undesirable , dramatic core collapse .",
    "therefore , it seems very unlikely that collisional scattering between dm particles is the main agent for the formation of cores .",
    "we will start in  [ sec : basic ] with a description of the basic physics behind the scenario of sidm and some predictions , which will be used in the remainder of the paper . in  [ sec : thegalaxy ] we briefly describe the properties of ngc 5963 and present mass models over a range of mass - to - light ratios of the stellar disk .",
    "we then compare with predictions of cosmological sidm simulations to constrain the self - interaction cross section of dm particles (  [ sec : constraints ] ) .",
    "some implications of the results are discussed in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the mass - density profiles of numerically simulated collisionless cdm halos are commonly parameterized with the analytical navarro , frenk & white profile : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the characteristic radius of the halo and @xmath20 is related to the density of the universe at the time of collapse . within the core region , the dark matter density increases as a power law @xmath21 and the velocity dispersion decreases toward the center at the radius @xmath19 .",
    "the parameters @xmath22 are usually expressed in a slightly different form by the concentration parameter @xmath23 and the rotation velocity @xmath24 at radius @xmath25 .",
    "the latter is the radius inside which the average overdensity is @xmath26 times the critical density of the universe .",
    "if dark matter particles experience self - interaction , the scattering thermalizes the inner regions of dark halos , producing a constant - density core ( e.g. , burkert 2000 ) .",
    "it is expected that the core radius will be comparable to the inversion radius , i.e.  the radius at which the velocity dispersion peaks . after reaching the maximum core size",
    ", the core can begin to recollapse due to the gravothermal catastrophe . in order to have a core ,",
    "the relaxation time should be less than @xmath27 of hubble time , so that it should have sufficient time to form a core by thermalization , while the lifetime of its core should exceed @xmath28 hubble times , so the core should be far from collapse . in the monolithic scenario in which the halos evolve at isolation , the core radius increases in time as the result of self - interaction between halo particles . starting with a profile with inversion radius @xmath29",

    "the maximum radius that the core reaches before recollapse may be even larger .",
    "in fact , for the particular case of a hernquist ( 1990 ) model with break radius @xmath38 , kochanek & white ( 2000 ) found that @xmath30 reaches a maximum value of @xmath39 .",
    "since the velocity dispersion for a hernquist profile peaks at @xmath40 , the core radius @xmath30 at the maximum expansion is approximately @xmath41 .    the assumptions behind the monolithic scenario that the initial configuration follows a nfw profile and that halos evolve at isolation appear to be inconsistent with the sidm hypothesis in a cosmological context .",

    "the inclusion of dynamically hot material that continuously is accreted onto the halo ( in a cosmological context ) can prevent efficient heat transfer from the core to the halo . moreover , it turned out that since collisions already modify halo profiles in the dynamical process of halo growth , there is a smooth trend of increasing core radius with the effective value of @xmath42 .",
    "a core with a radius @xmath43 is formed if the mean number of collisions per particle and per hubble time in the center halo is about @xmath44@xmath5 .",

    "the existence of galaxies with large dm concentrations and central dm densities implies upper limits on the number of collisions per particle and hence on @xmath9 . in the following",
    "we consider the implications of the concentrated halo in the galaxy ngc 5963 .",
    "ngc 5963 is a relatively isolated lsb galaxy associated with the ngc 5866 group , with a suitable inclination angle of @xmath45 .",
    "its adopted distance is @xmath46 mpc , based on the recession velocity derived by bosma , van der hulst & athanassoula ( 1988 ) and a hubble constant of @xmath47 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 .",
    "the uncertainty in the distance is probably of order @xmath48 mpc .",
    "the distributions of light and mass were first reported by romanishin et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , who found a luminosity profile that exhibits a lens component , i.e.  a component with a plateau and a steep outer edge , and a small bulge ( see also simon et al .",
    "the extent of the lens is about @xmath49 kpc .",
    "the hi rotation curve was constructed by bosma et al .",
    "these authors emphasized that the dark halo of this galaxy is more concentrated than in normal sc s with similar rotation curves . in this sense , ngc 5963 obeys the rule pointed out by sancisi ( 2003 ) that an excess of light corresponds an excess of rotation and viceversa . beyond a radius of @xmath50",
    "kpc the rotation curve becomes fairly flat with a circular velocity @xmath51 @xmath52 km s@xmath1 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rc ] ) .",
    "if the dark halo can be approximated by the pseudoisothermal sphere , the one - dimensional velocity dispersion for halo particles for ngc 5963 would be of @xmath53 km s@xmath1 and , therefore , the halo particles undergo collisions in the low - velocity regime .    in order to study the cuspiness of the mass density profile in the galaxy centers",
    "it is required a rotation curve with a high spatial and velocity resolution and a large extension .",
    "this can be achieved by combining co , h@xmath54 data , and radio hi data .",
    "ngc 5963 is one of the targets of the sample of galaxies with high - resolution two - dimensional h@xmath54 and co velocity fields , which are free of beam - smearing , in simon et al .",
    "two - dimensional velocity fields are useful in order to avoid systematic uncertainties and to determine the existence of radial motions",
    ". multiple wavelengths studies of the velocity fields may also help to elucidate the origin of systematic errors that can make density profiles appear artificially shallow .",
    "the observations in co and h@xmath54 provide the rotation curve within a galactocentric radius of @xmath44 kpc , whereas the hi rotation curve allows us to trace the potential out to @xmath28 kpc .",
    "this galaxy lacks of measurable non - circular motions , i.e.  radial velocities @xmath55 km s@xmath1 , except perhaps in the rings between @xmath56 to @xmath57 , those being not large enough to affect the derivation of the dm density profile .",
    "simon et al .  ( 2004 ) compared the h@xmath54 and co velocities at every point and found an excellent agreement between them , with a mean offset of less than @xmath12 km s@xmath1 , and a scatter of @xmath58 km s@xmath1 .",
    "though the uncertainties in the rotation curve can be reduced by combining both velocity data , we prefer to use the co rotation curve and its associated errorbars rather than the formal errorbars of the h@xmath54 rotation curves , which simply indicate that the gaussian fit to the profile was well - determined .",
    "in particular , the co rotation curve is less sensitive to asymmetric drift corrections and other magnetic terms , due to the smaller small - scale motions of the molecular clouds compared to the ionized gas ( snchez - salcedo & reyes - ruiz 2004 ) . in addition , other uncertainties in mass models , as the mass - to - light ratio of the different components , impose a minimum error in any fit .",
    "figure [ fig : rc ] shows the co rotation curve in the inner galaxy and the hi rotation curve in the outer parts , with error bars indicating the uncertainties in the observations .",
    "the present galaxy is an ideal laboratory with which to test the effects of collisions between dm halo particles in the low velocity regime , not only for the properties of the galaxy but also for the quality of the data .",
    "we have constructed different mass models for this galaxy .",
    "first we calculate the rotation curve due to the neutral ( hi@xmath59he ) gas mass from the radial distribution of the hi surface density from bosma et al .",
    "the surface brightness profiles in the optical and near-_ir _ bands given by simon et al .",
    "( 2004 ) were used to derive the disk mass distribution by adopting a constant mass - to - light ratio for the disk .",
    "the resulting mass distribution was converted into a disk rotation curve .",
    "the difference between the sum of the squares of the observed velocity and the stellar plus gaseous rotation velocities was converted into a halo mass distribution after assuming a certain form for the halo .",
    "along this paper , all the fits to the co rotation curve were performed by a @xmath60-minimization . to make the best use of both the co and hi data , we have used a hybrid rotation curve .",
    "it consists of the co data over the range of radii where available and @xmath61 cm data to define the outermost points .",
    "this was accomplished by minimizing @xmath60 between @xmath62 and @xmath44 kpc but requiring that between @xmath63 and @xmath28 kpc , the goodness of the fit must be better than @xmath64 level , while rejected otherwise . in this way , the fits are statistically consistent with the hi rotation curve at large radii .",
    "different mass decompositions were fitted for the stellar mass - to - light ratio in the _",
    "r_-band varying from @xmath62 ( minimum disk ) up to @xmath65 m@xmath15/l@xmath66 ( maximum disk ) .",
    "we will denote by @xmath67 the stellar mass - to - light ratio in the _ r_-band in solar units .",
    "it is noteworthy that @xmath68 is the maximum value allowed by the smooth rotation curve but avoiding a hollow halo in the inner two points .",
    "however , it is submaximal in the sense that the maximum contribution of the stellar disk to the rotation curve is less than @xmath69 times the observed maximum rotation . in practice ,",
    "the stellar curve is scaled until the inner points match those of the smooth curve .",
    "depending on how many points are used , the maximum disk mass - to - light ratios may vary as much as @xmath70 . in the case of ngc 5963 and using the inner five points , simon et al .",
    "( 2004 ) obtained a dynamical value for the maximum mass - to - light ratio larger than the value quoted above , but it appeared unrealistic and inconsistent with the predictions from the galaxy colours by the bell et al .",
    "( 2003 ) population synthesis models .",
    "the dynamical maximum disk @xmath67 inferred by using two points is fully consistent with these predictions .",
    "[ fig : fits ] shows the best - fitting mass models for different values of @xmath71 with both the nfw halo and the cored pseudoisothermal halo : @xmath72 primed quantities are used where appropriate to denote the ( observed ) final states after adiabatic compression of the dark halo by the infall of the baryons as they cool and settle into a disk .",
    "the parameters of each model , the reduced @xmath73 of the fit and the probability @xmath74 that the data and the model could result from the same parent distribution are given in table [ table : parameters ] .",
    "it is important to remark that the observation that pseudoisothermal fits produce low reduced @xmath60 values does not demonstrate the presence of a constant - density core .",
    "simon et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have shown that a power - law density profile @xmath75 fits also very well the rotation curve of ngc 5963 .    in order to compare with simulations which do not include the baryonic physics , we need an estimate of the dm profile before the adiabatic compression by the baryon condensation , i.e.  the unprimed parameters of the halo .",
    "a cored profile is expected after adiabatic decompression .",
    "since the core baryons cause the dark profile to steepen , we have fitted the observed rotation curve , for a given @xmath76 , with a cuspy profile ( for convenience we have chosen the nfw profile ) and recovered the halo parameters @xmath77 of the approximately pseudoisothermal sphere before compression , following the standard model ( e.g. , blumenthal et al .",
    "1986 ; flores et al .",
    "for @xmath78 , the effect of compression by the baryons is so small that a cored profile is assumed before and after contraction .",
    "the recipe of blumenthal et al .",
    "( 1986 ) assumes that the matter distribution is spherically symmetric and that particles move on circular orbits .",
    "jesseit et al .  (",
    "2002 ) verified that if the disk formation is smooth , the contracted halos have density profiles that are in excellent agreement with the standard predictions .",
    "if the disk formation involves clumpy , cold streams or if the bulk of the central stars formed when the halo mass was still being assembled , the level of halo contraction may be smaller .",
    "gnedin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggested an improvement of the standard model of the response of the halo to condensation of baryons by a simple modification of the assumed invariant ( see gnedin et al .",
    "2004 for details ) .",
    "they show that the standard model systematically overpredicts the contraction .",
    "moreover , there exist other empirical evidence which suggests that adiabatic contraction is avoided ( e.g. , loeb & peebles 2003 ; dutton et al .",
    "therefore , _ our procedure provides an upper limit on the effect of adiabatic contraction . _    for illustration ,",
    "[ fig : adbtc ] shows the contribution to the rotation curve of the dark halo after correcting by adiabatic contraction , in the most extreme case of maximum disk @xmath79 .",
    "the fit to it adopting the pseudoisothermal profile is also shown .",
    "note that if we demand that the density of the halo must decrease monotonically with increasing radius , values @xmath80 would not be permitted in the _ standard _ adiabatic decompression approach .    in table 1 , best - fitting halo parameters are reported as a function of @xmath71 . even adopting the maximum disk solution",
    ", the halo of ngc 5963 , at present time , is extraordinary concentrated , with a central dark matter density greater than @xmath81 m@xmath15 pc@xmath16 and a core radius @xmath82 kpc .",
    "a thorough discussion aimed to identify what about ngc 5963 makes it unique was given by simon et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and need not be repeated here . in the next sections , we will discuss the implications of the halo of ngc 5963 for the self - interaction of dm particles .",
    "in principle we do not really know whether the core of the galaxy under consideration is still in the expansion phase or undergoing gravothermal core collapse aided by the gravitational contraction due to the baryons .",
    "in fact , the core contraction of the halo by the collapsing baryons may trigger a fast core collapse ( e.g. , kochanek & white 2000 , and  [ sec : corecollapse ] ) .",
    "this effect may be important for @xmath67 ratios close to the maximum disk value .",
    "using cosmological simulations of sidm as a calibrator , we first put limits on the cross section of dm particles assuming that the core of ngc 5963 is in the expanding phase due to heat transfers inwards (  [ sec : calibration ] ) . for large values of @xmath71 , however , core collapse triggered by baryon condensation may have dramatic consequences for the longevity of the core .",
    "we have to demand that the halos are in no danger of collapsing .",
    "this requirement implies another bound on the cross section , which is discussed in  [ sec : corecollapse ] .",
    "the galaxy halo profiles and the tight cross section limits coming from clusters of galaxies can be reconciled only if the cross section were inversely proportional to the halo velocity dispersion .",
    "nevertheless , except for subhalos undergoing the action of the hot halo environment , most of the relevant results found in simulations with a cross section independent of halo velocity dispersion are valid if the value of the cross section is interpreted as that appropriate to the velocity dispersion of the halo being considered .",
    "therefore , since we are primarily interested in a single object , we can gain additional physical insight by making also use of simulations with a velocity - independent cross section .      in cosmological simulations of structure formation in sidm scenario with effective cross sections @xmath4@xmath12",

    "moreover , the initial inversion of the temperature ( velocity dispersion of dm particles ) profile responsible for the core expansion may be erased by the adiabatic heating of dm particles , leading directly to a core collapse with no room for the expansion phase .",
    "we need to estimate the characteristic time for core collapse in the case @xmath159 , i.e.  when the effects of contraction are important . in their numerical simulations , kochanek & white ( 2000 ) assumed as initial conditions a hernquist profile with a cuspy core . in our case , i.e.  for values @xmath159 , it is realistic to start with such an initial configuration because a cusp in the density profile is a natural consequence of the adiabatic contraction caused by the baryons . in this regard , we can make use of the quantitative study of kochanek & white ( 2000 ) .",
    "the evolution of the collapse depends on the ratio between the collision mean free path , @xmath160 , to the local gravitational scale height @xmath161 ( balberg et al .",
    "systems initially having ratios @xmath162 at the outer edge of the core , have a lifetime of only a few relaxation times and @xmath163 are related by the relation @xmath164 . ]",
    "( quinlan 1996 ; kochanek & white 2000 ; balberg et al .",
    "2002 ) . for the range of @xmath127 explored in kochanek & white ( 2000 ) , the central density increases by an order of magnitude in a timescale @xmath165 , being @xmath166 for the nfw profile .",
    "in particular , for @xmath131 , this timescale is only @xmath167 times the core - radius relaxation time .",
    "this result is troublesome for the survival of the core because it recollapses quickly after its formation and could not persist until today ( see  [ sec : basic ] ) .",
    "let us calculate the core timescale @xmath168 for the halo of ngc 5963 .",
    "as said before , because of the adiabatic compression by the baryons , a cuspy halo , such as the nfw profile , is expected even in the presence of dm collisions .",
    "the best nfw model for @xmath79 corresponds to @xmath169 and @xmath170 km s@xmath1 , implying a core - radius timescale : @xmath171 for the above halo parameters , @xmath172 and hence the central density will be enhanced by a factor @xmath28 in the timescale @xmath173    taken @xmath174 @xmath3 g@xmath1 , we get @xmath175 gyr . this estimate has uncertainties of as much as a factor @xmath94 .",
    "this short timescale indicates that the dark halo may have sufficient time to increase its central density by a factor @xmath176-@xmath177 . in order to prevent the dark halo from such dramatic evolution",
    ", we must demand that @xmath178 one hubble time , implying @xmath179 @xmath3 g@xmath1 . proceeding in the same way we obtain @xmath180 @xmath3 g@xmath1 but now for the mass model with @xmath181 . the line connecting these two points in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] delimits the region where cross sections are probably small enough to avoid catastrophic core collapse in the halo of ngc 5963 . the corresponding line at the @xmath64 confidence is also plotted .",
    "we see that the new constraint , which accounts for the role of baryons when @xmath182 , is tighter than the one derived in the previous subsections .",
    "this all but removes the permitted window for cross sections @xmath153@xmath12",
    "@xmath3 g@xmath1 in mass models with @xmath183 , that remained open . combining both constraints",
    ", the maximum of the permitted value @xmath184 @xmath3 s@xmath1 , at @xmath115 confidence level , occurs for @xmath185 .",
    "apart from the obvious interest for the still unknown nature of dark matter , the possibility of it having a nonzero self - interaction cross section has other astrophysical implications .",
    "sidm was suggested as a route to form cores in lsb and dwarf galaxies .",
    "the fact that the required cross sections are comparable to the cross section for particles interacting with each other via the strong force , has led to speculate that dm particles could interact with both themselves and with baryons through the strong force ( wandelt et al .",
    "the interaction of dark matter with protons might contribute to reheat the intracluster medium in the central regions of clusters of galaxies ( qin & wu 2001 ; chuzhoy & nusser 2004 ) .",
    "a large range of parameters space is being ruled out by current experimental and astrophysical bounds .",
    "previous studies have gradually whittled down the dm cross section allowed to solve the cuspy problem of halos in @xmath114cdm cosmology .",
    "in addition to statistical studies , the analysis of individual galaxies can give additional constraints on the strength of dm self - interaction cross section .    the dark matter distribution in ngc 5963 is challenging for any model designed to form central cores in dwarf and lsb galaxies .",
    "apparently , its halo distribution seems at odds with the results of sidm simulations with cross sections @xmath186@xmath12",
    "@xmath3 g@xmath1 , which produce central densities @xmath14 m@xmath15 pc@xmath16 , fairly independent of the halo mass , and core radii @xmath158@xmath63 kpc .",
    "the highly concentrated halo of ngc 5963 implies upper limits for the interaction of dark matter particles , unless we change our assumption of constant @xmath67",
    ". a higher @xmath67 for the disk than for the lens is required to have a less concentrated halo . however , the observed _ b - v _ colours of the disk and the lens do not favour this possibility ( see bosma et al .",
    "1988 for a discussion ) .",
    "great efforts have been made to constrain the collisional cross section of dm particles .",
    "it was suggested that this cross section should be small enough so the core halo of dwarf and lsb galaxies would not collapse in a hubble time ( e.g. , hennawi & ostriker 2002 ) .",
    "hence , the halo of ngc 5963 by itself can not be going through the gravothermal contraction phase .",
    "however , core collapse may be induced by the action of the baryons as they deepen the potential well and compress the core in an adiabatic process .",
    "therefore , the core of ngc 5963 may be expanding if the thermalization has not been completed , or shrinking if the core is adiabatically compressed , which may occur only at large values of @xmath67 .",
    "either the core of ngc 5963 is expanding or contracting in size , a tight constraint @xmath187 @xmath3 g@xmath1 at @xmath188 confidence level , which indicates that our results are robust to reasonable dm uncertainties , is derived .",
    "this upper limit for @xmath147 may be overestimated as much as a factor @xmath94 because of our conservative assumptions .",
    "thus , the original motivation for sidm of lowering the core densities of galactic halos require collisional cross sections too large to be consistent with the halo of ngc 5963 .",
    "one of the largest uncertainties in any mass model is the precise value of @xmath67 because depends on extinction , star formation history , etc .",
    "based on various considerations , e.g. , stellar population synthesis , stellar counts and kinematics in the solar neighbourhood and kinematics of external galaxies , some authors argue that @xmath189 in the _ i_-band ( e.g. , mo & mao 2000 , and references therein ) and @xmath190 in the _ r_-band ( simon et al .",
    "this would mean that the constraint derived from the core collapse discussed in  [ sec : corecollapse ] is the most relevant , and suggests an upper limit @xmath191 @xmath3 g@xmath1 .",
    "this value coincides with the upper limit inferred in clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , meneghetti et al .  2001 ; arabadjis & bautz 2004 ) .",
    "upper limits in the @xmath192@xmath6 @xmath3 g@xmath1 range were derived by hennawi & ostriker ( 2002 ) from the mass of supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies . for effective cross sections @xmath193",
    "@xmath3 g@xmath1 , the accretion of sidm onto seed black holes would produce excessively massive black holes . however , there are serious uncertainties associated with this limit because they make use of the hypothesis that initially the density dm distribution follows the nfw profile , whereas the numerical study of coln et al .",
    "( 2002 ) of sidm cosmology suggests that the nfw profile at the center of the halos is not achieved at any time .",
    "therefore , the otherwise excessive accretion of matter onto the black hole may not occur ( coln et al .",
    "2002 ) .    in order to reconcile the collisional dm hypothesis as a viable explanation of the formation of the constant density cores with the halo of ngc 5963 ,",
    "we should identify potential ways able to compensate the evacuation of dm in the central parts caused by the scattering of dm or to forestall the core collapse , depending whether the core of ngc 5963 is expanding or collapsing .",
    "tidal redistribution of mass at the halo center can not be efficient in ngc 5963 because the nearest large galaxy in the group is at a projected distance of @xmath194 kpc .",
    "one could relax our simplifying assumption that the halo consists of a well mixed homogeneous dm distribution and to consider a clumpy medium .",
    "the final density profile will be the result of two competing effects .",
    "on the one hand , the mass infall associated with the spiraling of putative massive clumps of dm ( @xmath195 m@xmath15 ) towards the galactic center by dynamical friction , produces a replenishment of material and deepens the central potential well . on the other hand , dynamical friction heating may be effective in flattening the inner dm profile . unlike clusters of galaxies in which substructure is important in determining the final dm distribution ( e.g. , nipoti et al .",
    "2004 ) , halos of lsb galaxies are already largely assembled at @xmath196 and hence , they have had sufficient time to disrupt the halo substructure , forming a smooth dm distribution within the luminous radius , unless ngc 5963 had a prominent mass aggregation history",
    ". however , an anomalous accretion history would be very unsatisfactory because it would have dramatic consequences for the disk itself , producing an excessive dynamical heating or even its destruction .",
    "moreover , ma & boylan - kolchin ( 2004 ) argued that energy deposition by merging dark matter substructures likely flatten density profiles . in the lack of any of those potential mechanisms capable to make significant mass redistribution",
    ", we think that our analysis is robust , even though it is based on the halo of a single galaxy .",
    "the halo of ngc 5963 is problematic for any model whose mechanism to produce large cores in lsb galaxies depends on collisions between dm particles ( e.g. , annihilating dark matter ) , reducing the parameters space and suggesting new directions for dm search .",
    "our analysis also places strong constraints to the non - hadronic exotic q - balls as a dark matter candidate in galaxies .",
    "these `` particles '' might be arranged to have mutual collisions with a large cross section and , in addition , q - balls can stick together after collision , reducing the self - interaction as scattering proceeds ( kusenko & steinhardt 2001 ) . in order to be consistent with the halo of ngc 5963",
    ", self - interactions between q - balls should shut off to a negligible value after @xmath12@xmath94 collisions per particle in order for the initial scatterings to smooth out halo cusps but avoiding gravothermal collapse .",
    "perhaps the solution of the halo core problem resides in decaying dark matter ( cen 2001a , b ; snchez - salcedo 2003 ) . if dark matter particles in galactic halos decay to stable particles with a recoiling velocity of a few tens of kilometers per second , then a fraction of lsb galaxies can still present a substantial concentration",
    "this novel dynamics associated with decaying dark matter was illustrated by snchez - salcedo ( 2003 ) for the case of the lsb galaxy ngc 3274 .",
    "we believe that the halos of ngc 5963 and ngc 3274 are not pathological cases as far as their dm distributions concern .",
    "there are additional independent evidence on the existence of galaxies with large central densities .",
    "loewenstein & mushotzky ( 2002 ) , in an as - yet - unpublished work , have determined the enclosed mass profile for the elliptical galaxy ngc 4636 using x - ray observations . for this galaxy",
    "the central density in models with dark matter cores is higher than expected in the sidm scenario with @xmath197 ( loewenstein & mushotzky 2002 ) .",
    "future observations of lsb galaxies containing a very low density of luminous material even in the inner parts , so that the observed dynamics should be dominated by the gravitational forces of the dark halo at small radii as well as large radii , will be able to determine whether cores are produced by the gravitational interaction between the luminous and dark matter , and will provide further constraints on the nature of dm in galaxies .",
