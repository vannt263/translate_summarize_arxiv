    "the total yields and inclusive spectra of different species of hadrons in leptonuclear interactions reflect the complicated space - time structure of the quark string fragmentation , the hadron formation and the secondary intranuclear interactions .",
    "the experimental investigations on this topic concern mainly stable hadrons ( pions , kaons , ( anti)protons )",
    ". meanwhile , the data concerning hadronic resonances ( being , predominantly , direct products of the quark string fragmentation ) can provide a valuable additional information about the nuclear medium influence on the leptoproduction processes . hitherto , no data are available for the a- dependence of the total yields and inclusive spectra of hadronic resonances in lepton - induced reactions . + this work is devoted to the study , for the first time , of the a- dependence of @xmath1 meson neutrinoproduction on nuclei . to this end , the data from the skat bubble chamber are used . in section 2",
    ", the experimental procedure is described .",
    "the experimental data on the a- dependence of the total yield and inclusive spectra of @xmath1 are presented in section 3 and discussed in section 4 .",
    "the results are summarized in section 5 .",
    "the experiment was performed with skat bubble chamber @xcite , exposed to a wideband neutrino beam obtained with a 70 gev primary protons from the serpukhov accelerator .",
    "the chamber was filled with a propane - freon mixture containing 87 vol% propane ( @xmath8 ) and 13 vol% freon ( @xmath9 ) with the percentage of nuclei h : c : f : br = 67.9:26.8:4.0:1.3 % .",
    "a 20 kg uniform magnetic field was provided within the operating chamber volume .",
    "+ charged current interactions containing a negative muon with momentum @xmath100.5 gev / c were selected .",
    "other negatively charged particles were considered to be @xmath11 mesons . protons with momentum below 0.6 gev@xmath12 and a fraction of protons with momentum 0.6 - 0.85",
    "gev@xmath12 were identified by their stopping in the chamber .",
    "non - identified positively charged particles were considered to be @xmath13 mesons .",
    "events in which errors in measuring the momenta of all charged secondaries and photons were less than 60% and 100% , respectively , were selected .",
    "each event is given a weight which corrects for the fraction of events excluded due to improperly reconstruction .",
    "more details concerning the experimental procedure , in particular , the reconstruction of the neutrino energy @xmath14 can be found in our previous publications @xcite .",
    "+ the events with @xmath15 30 gev were accepted , provided that the reconstructed mass @xmath16 of the hadronic system exceeds 2 gev .",
    "no restriction was imposed on the transfer momentum squared @xmath17 .",
    "the number of accepted events was 4353 ( 5508 weighted events ) .",
    "the mean values of the kinematical variables were @xmath18 = 10.7 gev , @xmath19 = 3.0 gev , @xmath20 = 9.6 gev@xmath21 , @xmath22 = 2.8 ( gev / c)@xmath21 .",
    "+ further , the whole event sample was subdivided , using several topological and kinematical criteria @xcite , into three subsamples : the cascade subsample @xmath23 with a sign of intranuclear secondary interaction , the quasiproton ( @xmath24 ) and quasineutron ( @xmath25 ) subsamples .",
    "about 40% of subsample @xmath24 is contributed by interactions with free hydrogen .",
    "weighting the quasiproton events with a factor of 0.6 , one can compose a pure nuclear subsample @xmath26 and a quasinucleon subsample @xmath27 .",
    "it has been verified @xcite , that the multiplicity and spectral characteristics of secondary particles in the @xmath28 subsample are in satisfactory agreement with those measured with a pure proton ( deuteron ) target .",
    "the effective atomic weight corresponding to the subsample @xmath29 is estimated @xcite to be approximately equal to @xmath30 , when taking into account the probability of secondary intranuclear interactions in the composite target .",
    "+ in order to extract the a- dependence of the @xmath1 neutrinoproduction , we use in the next section the data obtained for subsamples @xmath31 and @xmath29 , as well as the published data @xcite on neutrino - freon interactions ( with @xmath32 ) .",
    "the @xmath33 effective mass distribution for subsamples @xmath31 and @xmath29 is plotted in fig .",
    "clear signals near the @xmath1 mass , as well as faint signals near the @xmath34 mass are seen .",
    "the distributions are fitted by expression    @xmath35    where the mass dependence of the background distribution is parametrized as    @xmath36    while for @xmath37 and @xmath38 the corresponding relativistic breit - wigner functions @xcite for @xmath1 and @xmath34 were used , taking into account the experimental mass resolution @xmath39 = 35 mev .",
    "the mass and width of resonances are fixed as : @xmath40 = 775 mev and @xmath41 = 150 mev from the pdg data @xcite and @xmath42 = 963 mev and @xmath43 = 35 mev from the recent nomad measurements @xcite .",
    "+ the resulting total yields of @xmath1 and @xmath34 are presented in table 1 , where the skat data for @xmath1 in neutrino - freon interactions @xcite are also given .",

    "the data on @xmath11 indicate , in accordance with our previous studies ( see details in @xcite ) a clear depletion in the forward hemisphere ( due to the nuclear attenuation ) and a significant enhancement in the backward hemisphere ( due to the secondary inelastic intranuclear interactions ) . a faint indication on similar effects are also seen for @xmath1 . + as it is seen from table 2 and fig .",
    "3 where the distributions on @xmath3 for @xmath1 and @xmath11 are plotted , the overwhelming part of @xmath1 in @xmath48 interactions and the most part of that in nuclear interactions are produced in the forward hemisphere , as a result of the current quark ( @xmath49 or @xmath50 ) fragmentation into a favorable hadron @xmath1 ( which can contain the current quark ) , while the production of the ( unfavorable ) @xmath11 meson occurs mainly in the central region . as a result",
    ", the ratio @xmath51 for the fastest hadrons ( with @xmath52 ) significantly exceeds that in other ranges of the variable @xmath3 , as it can be seen from fig .",
    "4 . note , that a comparison of our data with those obtained at higher energies does not reveal any @xmath16- dependence of the @xmath51 ratio in the forward hemisphere .",
    "indeed , the values of @xmath53 = 2.42@xmath541.08 at @xmath55 0.5 for @xmath48 - interactions and @xmath56 = 0.12@xmath540.04 at @xmath55 0 for @xmath57 - interactions obtained in this work are compatible , respectively , with @xmath58 = 1.99@xmath540.44 measured in @xmath59 - interactions at @xmath19 = 6.1 gev @xcite and @xmath60 = 0.13@xmath540.03 measured in @xmath61 - interactions at @xmath19 = 4.8 gev @xcite .",
    "+ it is interesting to compare the relative yield of strange and non - strange favorable mesons , @xmath62 and @xmath1 , with that of unfavorable ones , @xmath63 and @xmath11 .",
    "the former can be extracted using our recent data on @xmath62 neutrinoproduction @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath62 and @xmath1 total yields is estimated to be 0.19@xmath540.14 ( for @xmath0 = 1 ) and 0.20@xmath540.11 ( for @xmath64 21 ) which seems to exceed that for @xmath63 and @xmath11 measured in @xcite : 0.055@xmath540.013 ( for @xmath0 = 1 ) and 0.070@xmath540.011 ( for @xmath64 21 ) .",
    "these data , therefore , indicate , that the strangeness content in favorable mesons in neutrino - induced reactions is higher than that for unfavorable ones .    in figs .",

    "5 shows the invariant distribution on @xmath3 .",
    "it is seen , that the data do not exhibit a significant @xmath0- dependence in the forward hemisphere , while at @xmath65 0 the @xmath1 yield in @xmath57 - interactions is enhanced as compared to @xmath48 - interactions .",
    "+ the distributions on the variable @xmath66 are presented in fig .",
    "it is seen , that they tend to shift towards lower values of @xmath4 with increasing a , as expected due to the effects of secondary intranuclear interactions .",
    "7 shows the @xmath4- dependence of the ratio @xmath67 .",
    "the data exhibit no significant dependence on @xmath0 , thus indicating that the nuclear effects are approximately the same for @xmath1 and pions ( averaged over @xmath68 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "the data presented in the previous section indicate on a small but not negligible role of nuclear effects in the @xmath1 neutrinoproduction . it is interesting to clarify whether these effects are compatible with expectations based on the accounting for intranuclear interactions of secondary pions , @xmath69 , resulting in a @xmath1 multiplicity gain @xmath70 ( mainly at @xmath47 ) , as well as the absorption processes , @xmath71 ( no @xmath1 ) , resulting in a yield reduction , @xmath72 ( mainly at @xmath46 ) .",
    "the details of a simple model incorporating these processes can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "+ the gain @xmath73 induced by pions with momenta @xmath74 is determined by the differential multiplicity of pions , @xmath75 , the mean probability of their secondary inelastic interactions @xmath76 averaged over the nuclei of the composite target , and by the mean multiplicity @xmath77 of @xmath1 in inelastic @xmath78 interactions .",
    "the values of @xmath77 extracted ( with an uncertainty of about @xmath54 15% ) from the available experimental data @xcite vary from 0.002 at @xmath79 = 0.9 - 1 gev@xmath12 up to 0.22 at @xmath79 = 10 - 15 gev@xmath12 ( the end of the pion spectrum in this experiment ) .",
    "+ the product @xmath80 was integrated over the momentum spectra of charged pions measured in quasinucleon interactions .",
    "the contribution from secondary interactions of @xmath81 mesons is assumed to be the average of those for @xmath68 and @xmath11 mesons .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath82 are found to be 0.031@xmath540.005 for @xmath83 45 and 0.023@xmath84 for @xmath83 21 .",
    "the latter value can be compared with the experimental value of @xmath85 = 0.020@xmath540.012 , inferred from the last two lines of table 2 ( note , that in the evolution of the error in @xmath86 the correlation between the values of @xmath87 and @xmath88 was taken into account here and below ) .",
    "+ in order to estimate the @xmath1 yield decreasing , @xmath89 , one needs to know the @xmath1 absorption cross section @xmath90 via the channel @xmath71 ( no @xmath1 ) .",
    "as @xmath90 is not known , we use tentative values in between @xmath91 mb . at these values ,",
    "the probability @xmath92 of the @xmath1 absorption is estimated to be 23@xmath546% for @xmath83 45 and 18@xmath545% for @xmath83 21 ( see @xcite for details of the absorption probability calculations ) . with these probabilities ,",
    "the value of @xmath93 is equal to -0.016@xmath540.008 and -0.012@xmath540.006 , respectively .",

    "+ the total multiplicity gain , @xmath95 , is predicted to be @xmath96 = 0.011@xmath540.007 for @xmath83 21 and 0.015@xmath540.009 for @xmath83 45 . these values are compatible with a rather weak variation of @xmath97 with @xmath0 ( cf .",

    "the large errors in @xmath98 do not allow to check quantitatively the predictions of the model incorporating secondary intranuclear interactions .",
    "new experimental data on @xmath1 production in @xmath48 and @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) interactions are obtained at intermediate energies ( @xmath18 = 10.7 gev , @xmath19 = 3.0 gev ) .",
    "for the first time , nuclear effects in @xmath1 neutrinoproductions are observed .",
