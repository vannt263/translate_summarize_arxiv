    "the ising model is a well known static , equilibrium model .",
    "its dynamical generalizations , the kinetic ising models , were originally intended to study relaxational processes near equilibrium states @xcite .",
    "glauber introduced the single spin - flip kinetic ising model , while kawasaki constructed a spin - exchange version for studying the case of conserved magnetization .",
    "nonequilibrium kinetic ising models , in which the steady state is produced by kinetic processes in connection with heat baths at different temperatures , have been widely investigated and results have shown that various phase transitions are possible under nonequilibrium conditions , even in one dimension ( 1d ) ( for a review see the article by rcz in ref .",
    "most of these studies , however , have been concerned with the effects the nonequilibrium nature of the dynamics might exert on phase transitions _ driven by temperature_.    a different line of investigating nonequilibrium phase transitions has been via branching annihilating random walk ( barw ) processes .",
    "the parity conservation of particles is decisive in determining the universality class of the phase transition .",
    "a coherent picture of this scenario is provided from a renormalization point of view in @xcite .",
    "the first example of a barw model with an even number of offsprings exhibiting the so called pc ( parity conserving ) transition was reported by grassberger et al.@xcite .",
    "a class of general nonequilibrium kinetic ising models ( nekim ) with combined spin flip dynamics at @xmath0 and kawasaki spin exchange dynamics at @xmath1 has been proposed by one of the authors @xcite in which , for a range of parameters of the model , pc - type transition takes place .",
    "this model has turned out to be very rich in several respects , for a review see@xcite .",
    "absorbing transitions have been , however mostly studied in particle - type models . the n - barw2 model is a classical stochastic system of @xmath2 types of particles with branching annihilating random walk and two offsprings . for @xmath3",
    "the model exhibits , at finite branching rate @xmath4 , pc type transition [ 8 - 14 ] . for @xmath5 @xmath2 types of particles @xmath6 perform diffusion , pairwise annihilation of the same species and branching @xmath7 with rate @xmath4 for @xmath8 and with rate @xmath9 for @xmath10 . in case of @xmath11",
    "this model is always active except for the annihilation fixed point at zero branching rate . according to field theory @xcite the coarse - grained , bosonic version of the model forms a different universality class , the so called n - barw2 with exponents in one dimension as follows : @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 here",
    "the exponents are defined as follows .",
    ": @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 is the characteristic time , @xmath19 is the correlation length and @xmath20 , @xmath21 are the particle densities at time @xmath22 and in the steady state , respectively .",
    "hard core interactions have proven to be relevant in case of the n - barw2 model by drastically changing the universality class @xcite .",
    "the arrangement of the offsprings relative to the parent turns out to be a relevant factor and causes two robust classes that are insensitive to parity conservation @xcite or the binary nature of the production process @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present an asymmetric spin - model ( nekima ) with asymmetry both in the annihilation and spin - flip rate as a generalization of nekim . on the level of kinks",
    ", however , this model corresponds to a process of a and b particles with @xmath23 and @xmath24 -type branching and @xmath25 annihilation and @xmath26 exclusion .",
    "nevertheless , as will be presented below using computer simulations , the critical properties near the zero branching limit are the same as for the n - barw2 model cited above with no sign of exclusion effects since alternating sequences of @xmath27-s and @xmath28-s occur like in @xcite , hence hard core interactions can not play an important role . moreover , at finite branching rate of the kinks a line of directed percolation ( dp ) -type transition @xcite occurs which is well described by @xmath29 level cluster mean - field calculations .",
    "the general form of the glauber spin - flip transition rate in one - dimension for spin @xmath30 sitting at site @xmath31 is @xcite ( @xmath32 ) : @xmath33 \\label{gla}\\ ] ] at zero temperature .",
    "usually the glauber model is understood as the special case @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "the kawasaki spin - exchange transition rate of neighbouring spins @xcite at @xmath1 reduces to an unconditional nearest neighbour exchange : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the probability of spin exchange .",
    "the quantities in eqs .",
    "( [ gla ] ) and ( [ kaw ] ) conserve spin symmetry , of course . concerning spin exchanges , which act only at domain boundaries ,",
    "the process of main importance here is that a kink can produce two offsprings at the next time step with probability @xmath38 by changing @xmath37 for _ negative values of @xmath39 _ this model displays phase transitions in the parity conserving universality class @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will be interested in investigating an extended version of the above model .",
    "instead of ( [ gla ] ) we will prescribe the rates for the case @xmath35 , @xmath34 as follows .",
    "the @xmath40 and @xmath41 processes remain as in ( [ gla ] ) i.e. at zero temperature no kink - pair creations occur inside of domains .",
    "further rates will be chosen in such a way that they break the symmetry of @xmath42 and @xmath43 spins locally .",
    "such dynamically self - induced field was first investigated in a different context by majumdar , dean and grassberger ( mdg ) @xcite , namely in studying the @xmath0 coarsening dynamics of an ising chain in a local field which favors @xmath43 spins as compared to @xmath42 ones dynamically .",
    "in addition to the choice in @xcite concerning the asymmetry in the annihilation rate @xmath44 further spin symmetry breaking will be introduced here , namely , in the spin - flip part of the glauber transition rate the strength of which will be measured by a further parameter @xmath45 . while the transition rate @xmath46 is unchanged , the two rates flipping @xmath42 spins will be reduced as @xmath47 in order to balance the effect of the other dynamically induced field arising from ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) by locally favoring @xmath42 spins .",
    "the spin - exchange part of the model remains as in the the spin - symmetric case , ( [ kaw ] ) .    in the terminology of domain walls or particles",
    "the following reaction - diffusion picture arises .",
    "there are two kinds of domain walls : @xmath48 and @xmath49 which can only occur alternately because of the spin background . upon meeting @xmath25",
    "while in the opposite sequence , @xmath50 , the two domain - walls are repulsive due to ( 7 ) .",
    "the absorbing states in the extreme situation @xmath51 when spin flipping maximally favors @xmath42 spins , are states with single frozen @xmath43 spins like @xmath52 . by increasing @xmath45 , a slow random walk of these lonely @xmath43- spins starts and by annihilating random",
    "walk only one of them survives and performs rw .",
    "the all @xmath42 and all @xmath43 states are , of course , also absorbing .",
    "the inclusion of nearest neighbor spin exchange , ( [ kaw ] ) , changes the picture drastically .",
    "spin exchange leads to @xmath53 and @xmath24 type kink production , which , together with @xmath25 annihilation ( @xmath54 is forbidden due to the annihilation - asymmetry , eqs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) ) and diffusion of @xmath27 and @xmath28 leads to a kind of two - component , coupled branching and annihilating random walk .",
    "the phase diagram and the nature of the transitions will be reported and discussed in the following .",
    "given three independent parameters @xmath39 , @xmath45 and @xmath37 ( or rather @xmath55 ) with the restriction eq .",
    "( [ p+ ] ) it is hard to explore the whole phase diagram . in the original ( spin - symmetric ) case of nekim @xcite we have investigated the phase boundary in the parameter space @xmath56 . for _ negative _ values of @xmath39 a line of pc transitions was found .",
    "we are not going to investigate the @xmath57 case in the following and only make the remark that spin - asymmetry as introduced above ( with a trivial generalization for @xmath58 ) , changes the parity conserving character of the transitions to directed percolation - type ( of two species ) , as could be expected .",
    "the case @xmath59 ( including the glauber case @xmath60 ) was found to be ising - like , for all values of @xmath37 .    introducing spin - asymmetry",
    ", however , makes the glauber case also richer in phases . the phase diagram in the plane of parameters @xmath37 and @xmath61 as obtained by computer simulations",
    "is shown on fig.[phasedia ] .    in fixing",
    "the phase boundary the quantity measured was the density of kinks , @xmath20 , as a function of time starting from a random initial distribution of up and down spins .",
    "the chain size @xmath62 varied between @xmath63 and up to @xmath64 monte carlo steps ( mcs ) were reached .",
    "the way of updating was as in ref.@xcite .",
    "a line of dp transitions has been found by the power - law behaviour of @xmath65 with @xmath66 , the value characteristic of dp transition .",
    "this was , of course , the expected kind of order - disorder transition on the basis of spin - asymmetry .",
    "the point @xmath67 , @xmath68 is a particular one , at this point our model goes over to the one investigated by majumdar et al .",
    "for these parameter values a very high precision computer measurement has given the result @xmath69 supporting an analytic independent interval approximation by these authors .",
    "in an equivalent model , however , the deviation from the @xmath70 law has shown up as an initial density - dependent power function with a power of @xmath20 slightly deviating from @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "this problem , however , is not the subject of the present investigation .    concerning the phase diagram , fig .",
    "( [ phasedia ] ) , the parameter values in the vicinity of @xmath67 for @xmath72 are hard from the computational point of view as long transients show up in the time evolution .",
    "it is apparent , however , that the phase line ends up here tangentially . at @xmath67 the effect of the exchange term",
    "is such that for all @xmath73 the absorbing phase is entered : due to the choice in eqs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) , the all @xmath74 phase ( one of the absorbing phases ) is reached exponentially fast .    as to the other limiting situation @xmath51 , for @xmath68 the initial spin distribution freezes in .",
    "as a matter of fact , the line of phase transitions reaches the @xmath51 axis only by letting @xmath75 by @xmath76 ( @xmath77 is only fixing the rate of flips , see eq.(3 ) , while here we fixed it to unity ) .",
    "this circumstance , however , is of no importance for the results .",
    "cluster mean - field approximation introduced for nonequilibrium models by @xcite was applied for the present model .",
    "the @xmath3 mean - field equation for spin - up density is @xmath78 independently form @xmath37 , which gives a @xmath79 leading order decay to the @xmath80 solution for all @xmath81 , while it is constant ( keeps the initial value ) for @xmath51 .",
    "therefore this predicts a discontinuous transition along the @xmath51 axis .",
    "the corresponding steady state exponent is @xmath82 .",
    "similarly the kink density , @xmath83 ) , decays with a leading order singularity @xmath84 and exhibits a jump at the @xmath85 axis .",
    "the @xmath86 pair approximation results in the following steady state solution for kinks @xmath87    this has absorbing states ( @xmath88 ) along the @xmath89 , @xmath37=0 and @xmath90 lines and active in the @xmath91 , @xmath73 region .",
    "the transitions , however are continuous with leading order singularity @xmath15 everywhere .",
    "as we can see the simple mean - field and higher order cluster mean - field approximations give different singular behavior similarly to cases treated earlier@xcite .    for higher order approximations",
    "@xmath92 we could solve the equations for the steady state numerically only .",
    "we could determine stable solutions up to the @xmath29 level from the coupled non - linear equations of 36 variables . by locating the phase transition lines we found that the @xmath51 and the @xmath68 transitions do not change but the @xmath67 ( dp ) transition line shifts monotonically towards the @xmath51 axis as we increase the level of approximations ( see fig .",
    "( [ gmfphd ] ) .",
    "these solutions converge towards the phase transition line determined by simulations .",
    "we found that fairly good quadratic fitting can be applied for the @xmath93 level @xmath94 critical point solutions , so we extrapolated to @xmath95 at @xmath96 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath97 curve agrees well with the simulation data ( see table [ dplinetab ] .",
    "as we have seen in the previous subsection , in the plane of @xmath98 the phase below the phase transition line is the active one and extends down to the @xmath68 axis .",
    "the critical behavior at and in the neighborhood of this axis has turned out to be of n - barw2 type . in this respect",
    "the absorbing states are fully ordered or consist of single @xmath43 -es performing random walk in the sea of @xmath42 spins .",
    "the order parameter also in this case is the density of kinks @xmath99 , the steady state value of it disappears when approaching the @xmath68 axis as @xmath100 .",
    "simulations from random initial state in a system with size @xmath101 were run up to @xmath102 mcs . in the supercritical region",
    "the steady states have been determined for different @xmath37 values .",
    "following level - off the densities were averaged over @xmath103 mcs and @xmath104 samples . by looking at the effective exponent defined as @xmath105 one can read - off : @xmath106 .",
    "the result of computer simulations at @xmath107 is shown on fig.([betaeff ] ) .",
    "a linear extrapolation for @xmath108 gives @xmath109 .",
    "the overshooting of @xmath110 near the critical point is typical in case of logarithmic corrections to scaling . by plotting @xmath111 as the function of @xmath112 fairly good linear behavior",
    "could be observed in the @xmath113 region .",
    "the @xmath20 simulation results at @xmath68 and @xmath114 were analyzed by the local slopes @xmath115   \\over \\ln(m ) } \\label{slopes}\\ ] ] ( where @xmath116 is used ) .",
    "the asymptotic time evolution of the density of kinks @xmath117 has proven to be , within error , that of annihilating random walk : @xmath14 as shown on fig.([alpha ] ) .",
    "a @xmath118 correction to scaling gave best fit in both cases .",
    "we also tried to fit a logarithmic correction form @xmath119 for @xmath20 but @xmath120 was found to go zero for @xmath121 mcs in both cases .",
    "as to the remaining critical exponents when approaching @xmath68 we checked the expected n - barw2 behaviour by measuring the kink density in the active state ( steady state ) for several small values of @xmath37 ( between @xmath122 and @xmath123 ) for lattice size @xmath62 between @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the initial state was prepared in such a way that a cluster of @xmath126-es was chosen of width and location randomly distributed between @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "finite size scaling theory @xcite predicts the form @xmath129 using the value of @xmath130 as obtained above , we determine @xmath131 by data - collapsing . with @xmath132 on fig.([scalefun ] ) , we get @xmath133 . thus our result shows the critical exponent values by cardy and tuber @xcite .",
    "in this paper a new model has been presented by generalizing the nonequilibrium kinetic ising model for the case when two kinds of spin anisotropies are present.in addition to the local kinetic bias introduced by majumdar et al @xcite first , by prescribing with probability equal to zero the annihilation of @xmath43 spins in the neighborhood @xmath134 , we introduce spin - anisotropy in the spin - flip rate .",
    "namely , the @xmath135 spins are less likely to flip at domain boundaries ( with probability @xmath136 ) than @xmath126-es ( probability @xmath71 ) .",
    "branching of kinks ( domain boundaries ) is the main effect of the spin - exchange part of the model .",
    "we have shown by cluster mean field calculations and computer simulations that for a given @xmath137 asymmetry the presence of spin exchange gives rise to two different types of phase transitions .",
    "while at @xmath138 an active phase emerges with an n - barw2 type of transition , for @xmath139 this transforms back into an absorbing state with a dp class transition .",
    "the spin anisotropies result in a new type of two - component , coupled branching and annihilating random walk of kinks with parity conservation .    at @xmath67 the mdg point",
    "is reached , see fig .",
    "1 . it is the endpoint of the dp transition line similarly to the compact directed percolation endpoint of the dp transition line in the domany - kinzel cellular automaton model @xcite .",
    "the absorbing phase is the same in the two models , the active phase , however , is different .",
    "the question arises whether the @xmath140 factor in the asymptotic behaviour found in @xcite is to be expected to hold even in the present model for @xmath68 .",
    "if this were the case , the n - barw2 behavior would also be affected .",
    "first , from the side of simulations , we have not found any sign of such behavior .",
    "moreover , the physical picture behind the expected asymptotic behaviour of spins is also different in the two cases . while mdg argue that at late time the process @xmath141 with probability unity leads to @xmath135 domains sandwiched between much larger @xmath126 ones the introduction of the local asymmetric spin - flip magnetic field with bias for @xmath135 spins will act against and feed up the @xmath135 phase to compensate for their biased annihilation via the mdg process . as a consequence",
    "there is no reason to expect a late time logarithmic relaxation of the kink density on the @xmath68 line for @xmath137 .",
    "finally it is worth noticing that while the pc transition is known to be sensitive to the @xmath142 symmetry @xcite and dp transition appears by destroying it , the n - barw2 transition seems to be insensitive to this symmetry breaking .",
