    "the critical point terminating a first order phase transition line in the phase diagram of qcd at high temperature and density is one of the most characteristic features that may be discovered in heavy - ion collision experiments . to understand the phase structure , first principle calculations of qcd by numerical simulations are very important .",
    "one of the interesting approaches to find a first order phase transition is to construct the canonical partition function @xmath0 by fixing the total quark number @xmath3 or quark number density @xmath4 . from the canonical partition function , one can estimate the quark number giving the largest contribution to the grand partition function @xmath5 . because two different states coexist at a first order transition point , two different quark numbers give equally large contributions simultaneously if the transition is of first order .",
    "the canonical partition function is defined by a fugacity expansion of @xmath5 , @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the quark determinant , the gauge action and the number of flavor , respectively .",
    "the term @xmath10 can be regarded as the probability distribution of the quark number @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , it is worth introducing an effective potential @xmath12 as a function of @xmath11 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the helmholtz free energy . in a first order phase transition region , this effective potential has minima at more than one value of @xmath11 . at the minima ,",
    "the derivative of @xmath12 vanishes : @xmath15 hence , in the first order transition region , we expect @xmath16 takes the same value at different @xmath11 . here , @xmath17 is the chemical potential which gives the effective potential at a minimum point @xmath18 and becomes @xmath19 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "plane and the behavior of @xmath20 as a function of @xmath21 . , title=\"fig:\",width=355 ] -0.2 cm    -0.3 cm    the phase structure in the @xmath22 plane is sketched in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cano ] .",
    "the thick line is the phase transition line .",
    "we expect that the transition is crossover at low density and becomes of first order at high density . in the first order transition region , the two coexisting states are mixed .",
    "the region between the two thick lines is the mixed state .",
    "the expected behavior of @xmath23 along the lines a and b are shown in the right figure .",
    "when the temperature is higher than the temperature at the critical point @xmath24 ( line a ) , @xmath23 increases monotonically as the density increases",
    ". however , for the case below @xmath25 ( line b ) , this line crosses the mixed state .",
    "corresponding to the double - well potential in a finite volume , @xmath23 is expected to be an s - shaped function . in the infinite volume limit",
    ", @xmath23 does not increase in the region between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , since the surface energy between the two states can be ignored .",
    "the glasgow method @xcite has been a well - known method to compute the canonical partition function .",
    "a few years ago , the above mentioned behavior at a first order phase transition was observed in 4 flavor qcd with staggered fermions calculating the quark determinant by the glasgow algorithm on a small lattice @xcite .",
    "also , simulations with a fixed quark number , i.e. in the canonical ensemble , have been tried @xcite",
    ". however , the calculations by the glasgow algorithm and the simulations for a canonical ensemble require large computational cost and are difficult except on a small lattice with present day computer resources . in this report",
    ", we propose a method based on a saddle point approximation @xcite . by this approximation ,",
    "the computational cost is drastically reduced and the first order like behavior was observed for 2 flavor qcd .",
    "from eq .  ( [ eq : cpartition ] ) , the canonical partition function can be obtained by an inverse laplace transformation , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an appropriate real constant and @xmath30 is a real variable .",
    "we have used the fact that @xmath31 for any complex @xmath19 .",
    "the grand partition function can be evaluated by the following expectation value at @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33    we apply a saddle point approximation to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ eq : canonicalp ] ) , which reduces the computational cost . if one selects the @xmath29 at a saddle point in eq .",
    "( [ eq : canonicalp ] ) , the necessary information is limited that around the saddle point when the volume is sufficiently large . moreover , if we restrict ourselves to study the low density region , the value of @xmath34 near the saddle point can be estimated by a taylor expansion around @xmath32 .",
    "the calculation by the taylor expansion is much cheaper than the exact calculation and the study using a large lattice is possible .",
    "also , the truncation error can be systematically controlled by increasing the number of the expansion coefficients .",
    "we assume the existence of a saddle point @xmath35 in the complex @xmath36 plane for each configuration , which satisfies @xmath37 . here , the quark number density in a lattice unit and a physical unit are @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , @xmath40 $ ] and @xmath41 .",

    "( [ eq : chemap ] ) are complex , this calculation suffers from the sign problem . to eliminate the sign problem ,",
    "the approximation proposed in @xcite is used : if one assumes that the distribution of the complex phase is well - approximated by a gaussian function , the complex phase factor @xmath51 can be replaced by @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "we estimate the quark determinant by the taylor expansion up to @xmath53 . because the calculation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : chemap ] ) is similar to the calculation by the reweighting method , the configurations which give important contribution are changed by the modification ( reweighting ) factor . to avoid this problem , we use the multi-@xmath54 reweighting method . by this method ,",

    ", we find that a qualitative feature of @xmath20 changes around @xmath60 , i.e. @xmath20 increases monotonically as @xmath21 increases above 0.8 , whereas it shows an s - shape below 0.8 .",
    "this s - shape is a signature of a first order phase transition . with some approximations ,",
    "the critical value of @xmath20 is is estimated to be about @xmath61 , which is roughly consistent with the critical point estimated in @xcite by calculating the effective potential of the plaquette using the same configurations , @xmath62 .",
