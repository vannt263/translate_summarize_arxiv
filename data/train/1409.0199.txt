    "we highlight some general consequences of the self - propulsion process for the walker dynamics .",
    "as sketched in fig . [ fig1](a ) , a bath of silicon oil of viscosity @xmath2 cp is set into an oscillatory motion vertically at a frequency of @xmath3  hz and at an acceleration amplitude @xmath4 . a stationary wave pattern called faraday waves appear spontaneously at the surface above an acceleration threshold @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the acceleration of gravity .",
    "the appearance of faraday waves is triggered by a parametric instability at half the forcing frequency so the wave pattern oscillates vertically at a period @xmath7 s @xcite .",
    "the usual dispersion relation of surface waves prescribes the corresponding wavelength @xmath8 mm .",
    "a submillimetric drop is placed on the vibrating bath tuned slightly below the faraday threshold . at a typical bath acceleration of @xmath9 ,",
    "the drop bounces at twice the period of the bath , which corresponds to the faraday period @xmath10 , so that the drop becomes a faraday wave exciter . at each impact , the drop generates a capillary front which leads to the formation of a circular standing faraday wave pattern centered at the impact point .",
    "the complete mechanism of the wave generation is detailed in @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the emitted wave decreases in time as the bath acceleration amplitude @xmath4 is chosen slightly below the instability threshold .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath11 is a measure of the persistence time .",
    "it compares the damping time @xmath1 of the faraday waves to the time @xmath10 between two successive drop bounces . for a memory parameter larger than 1",
    ", the faraday wave emitted by each bounce is still surviving during at least the next bounce .",
    "the liquid surface will be thus perturbed by the waves generated during the @xmath12 previous impacts .",
    "the memory parameter @xmath12 can be tuned through the difference between the bath acceleration @xmath4 and the faraday threshold @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , close to the faraday threshold , the damping time diverges as @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the propulsion mechanism is a direct consequence of this memory effect .",
    "as soon as the decay time of faraday waves is larger than the faraday period ( @xmath14 ) , the drop hits a surface perturbed by the previous impacts .",
    "since the drop bounces on an inclined surface , there is a transfer of horizontal momentum to the drop .",
    "it has been shown that this situation leads to a pitchfork bifurcation at @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the vertical bouncing state becomes unstable and the drop starts moving , propelled by the waves emitted in its near past .    in the present study , the acceleration amplitude is set at about 90% of the faraday threshold @xmath0 , corresponding to a decay time @xmath16 .",
    "for such an acceleration , bouncing drops of diameter @xmath17 @xmath18 m moves at a horizontal velocity @xmath19 averaged on the vertical period of motion between 5 and 15 mm / s .",
    "the exact velocity value depends on the drop size and the bath acceleration and is fixed for a given drop @xcite .    for each drop",
    ", the decay time can be converted to a memory length @xmath20 .",
    "this length @xmath21 , sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , corresponds to the typical distance along which the faraday wave sources are still active behind the drop . in this article , we consider the low memory regime , i.e. , when the memory length @xmath21 is smaller than the typical curvature radius of any curved trajectory followed by the walker .",
    "one important consequence is that the wave sources contributing to the propulsion can be considered as mainly aligned on a straight line behind the drop .",
    "the force exerted by each wave on the drop is thus mainly tangential to the trajectory .",
    "consequently the global resulting force is mainly tangential to the trajectory .    in the absence of other external force",
    ", a drop bounces along a straight line until it reaches the boundary of the container .",
    "a more interesting experimental case is obtained when the walker is confined .",
    "this situation is obtained by trapping the walker in a harmonic potential well as sketched in fig . [ fig1](a ) . for this purpose ,",
    "the millimetric drop is loaded with a small amount of ferrofluid and is exposed to a magnetic field .",
    "two coils in a helmholtz configuration provide a uniform magnetic field in the region of interest and induces a magnetic moment @xmath22 to the drop .",
    "an additional non uniform magnetic field is generated by a cylindrical magnet with a diameter of @xmath23 mm and a height of @xmath24 mm placed above the liquid bath .",
    "the interaction between the external magnetic field and the drop magnetic dipole generates an external force on the magnetized drop . when the vertical distance @xmath25 between the magnet and the liquid surface is larger than the magnet diameter , the potential well can be considered as harmonic @xcite . for a drop of mass @xmath26 , the dynamics is then reduced to the motion of a bouncing particle propelled by a wave with an external forcing @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is a spring constant which can be tuned by changing the distance @xmath25 .",
    "the vector @xmath29 denotes the distance from the drop center to the symmetry axis of the magnet .",
    "additional experimental details have been given in the supplemental material of a previous work @xcite .",
    "when the walker is released from the edge of the cell , the magnetic force pulls it towards the center of the harmonic potential .",
    "as the drop is self - propelled , it will never stop at the center but orbits around it .",
    "this trapping mechanism is represented on a chronophotograph as seen from above [ see fig . [ fig2](a ) ] .",
    "the position is sampled every @xmath30 s , corresponding to the time interval of two vertical periods @xmath10 . in a few oscillations",
    ", the trajectory converges to a circular motion in which the walker orbits around the center at its free velocity @xmath19 .",
    "such a trajectory can also be computed from the numerical model developed by e. fort @xcite to mimic the walker dynamics ; [ see fig . [ fig2](b ) ] . the same quantitative behavior is recovered with this numerical model in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ( solid black line ) . finally , balancing the centripetal acceleration @xmath31 with the spring force @xmath32 , scales the final orbit radius @xmath33 as @xmath34 where @xmath35 corresponds to the natural frequency of the magnetic potential well , ( see figure [ fig2]c ) .",
    "the coefficient of proportionality @xmath36 differs slightly from @xmath37 as investigated by oza _",
    "_ @xcite and interpreted as a contribution of the surface waves in the radial mechanical balance .    for a hamiltonian system",
    ", one would expect a more diverse set of trajectories in a two dimensional harmonic well .",
    "but among all possible solutions , only the circular motion enables the particle to move at a constant speed .",
    "the selection of particular trajectories is a consequence of the dissipative nature of the walker dynamics .      in dissipative systems ,",
    "any volume of the phase space can contract in time and additional measurements have been carried out to study the transient regime .",
    "one way to proceed , is to study the transition between circular motions of different radius by abruptly changing the external force . a walker",
    "is then prepared on a circular orbit and the current inside the coils is switched between two values @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the consequence is an abrupt change of the characteristic frequency value from @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "a typical experimental signal is shown in fig . [ fig3](a ) .",
    "we observe a transition between two different circular motions of radii @xmath42 and @xmath43 corresponding to the two values of the spring constant . after each switch",
    ", the walker follows a reproducible transient regime and converges to the new circular attractor .",
    "this transition is repeated ten times with a duration of 10 s between each switch , larger than the observed transient duration . for small orbits ,",
    "the radius decreases slowly to the final state [ see fig . [ fig3](b ) ] . for larger orbits ,",
    "the radius increases quickly , crosses the final value and follows damped oscillations around the final state [ see fig . [ fig3](c ) ] .",
    "the transient behavior depends only on the final state which can be reached either from a smaller or a larger orbit .",
    "we thus find for the evolution of the instantaneous radius @xmath44 , typical transient behavior of a second - order oscillator , in which the quality factor strongly depends on the orbiting period @xmath45 of the final orbit .",
    "the qualitative change of the transient behavior shows that at least two time scales control the transition .",
    "depending on their ratio , the transient will evolve from oscillations without overshoot ( small orbits ) to damped oscillations with overshoot ( large orbits ) .",
    "the first time scale @xmath46 is imposed by the external force , and should be compared to another one .",
    "where does this second time scale come from ?",
    "we address this question in the next paragraph through a theoretical approach .",
    "the second time scale relies on the dissipative nature of the motion . in the present case ,",
    "the energy exchange comes from the coupling of the drop to the bath in two ways .",
    "first , the drop loses energy at impact by viscous dissipation but also because a new propagating capillary wave is generated .",
    "second , when the drop hits a non horizontal part of a wave , its horizontal momentum is changed .",
    "once the walker moves at its free velocity , i.e. , in a permanent regime , these two terms balance one another .",
    "a phenomenological description of the propulsive force has been introduced by a. boudaoud @xcite , e. fort _",
    "@xcite , and extended by oza _",
    "experiments show that the fluctuations of speed are typically smaller than @xmath2% .",
    "this speed constraint enables us to introduce a simplified expression to model the net accelerating force @xmath47 .",
    "we derive it through symmetry arguments and show _ a posteriori _ that such an expression fits the experimental results .",
    "as we are in the short memory regime , the force @xmath47 is mainly tangential to the trajectory , i.e. , @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 must only depend on the amplitude of the speed @xmath50 and not on its direction .",
    "an exchange @xmath51 should only change the sign of @xmath49 .",
    "consequently @xmath49 must be an odd function in @xmath50 , vanishing for a velocity equal to the equilibrium one @xmath19 .",
    "the simplest expression satisfying these requirements is @xmath52 with @xmath53 a constant homogeneous to a friction coefficient . for @xmath54",
    "the force is propulsive whereas it acts as a friction term for @xmath55 .",
    "this force vanishes for @xmath56 .",
    "such a term is called a rayleigh - type friction @xcite and is commonly used to model the motion of active particles .",
    "it is the lowest order expansion of a force which depends on the velocity and vanishes for an equilibrium velocity .",
    "alternatively , eq . [ forcepropulsion ] can be derived by a direct calculation detailed in the appendix .",
    "this form may also be derived from the integrodifferential formulation developed by oza _",
    "we state that @xmath47 is mainly tangential , but the corrective radial term could also be added .",
    "@xcite shows with a higher order expansion from an integrodifferential form that this extra term is responsible for the prefactor @xmath57 discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : iib ] . note that the various expressions of this velocity - dependent term introduced in previous studies @xcite are all equivalent to the rayleigh friction provided that the fluctuations in speed remain small , i.e. , less than 20% of the free velocity @xmath19 .",
    "the rayleigh - type friction retains the minimal complexity required to describe the walker propulsion theoretically .",
    "however , our expression is not intended to describe the consequence of an abrupt change of velocity .",
    "such cases have been encountered for very specific situations , like highly disordered trajectories @xcite , where velocity fluctuations become larger than @xmath58% . in the present article",
    ", we do not observe significant discrepancies between our simplified model and the experimental data .",
    "the horizontal dynamics can then be rationalized by a continuous equation as the bouncing period @xmath59 is much smaller than the period of rotation @xmath60 s @xcite . using the rayleigh - type friction law and the continuous limit ,",
    "the simplified equation of motion for a walker in a harmonic potential becomes : @xmath61 with @xmath62 a characteristic time .",
    "the one - dimensional case is equivalent to a van der pol oscillator for the velocity , signature of the hamiltonian structure breaking . in spite of its apparent simplicity",
    ", only a few articles deal with the two - dimensional case .",
    "@xcite studied this equation in two dimensions including noises , indicating that circular motions are solutions .",
    "however , the two dimensional rayleigh equation has not been solved analytically .",
    "this can be attributed to the friction term , which involves the norm of the speed .",
    "this term provides a coupling between the motions in the two directions of space .",
    "one particularity of this equation is the presence of two different time scales .",
    "the external force provides the period of oscillation while the rayleigh type friction introduces another time scale @xmath63 , the typical time needed for a walker to recover its free velocity .",
    "it should not depend on the external force and is thus a physical parameter for a given bouncing drop at a given memory @xmath12 . even if symmetry arguments enable us to obtain the simplified equation [ equadiff1 ] , they do not provide the value of this characteristic time @xmath63",

    "the consequence is an increase of the convergence time .",
    "we note that the convergence time depends slightly on the initial conditions as soon as the initial motion is not radial . in this purely radial case ,",

    "we have been able to obtain the value of the second characteristic time @xmath63 .",
    "we now turn to the question : which role does each mechanism play to stabilize onto the circular attractors ?      as shown in the previous part , the transient regime of a walker can present either oscillations of radial position or oscillations of speed .",
