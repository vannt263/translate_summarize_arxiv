    "the first complete protocol for quantum key distribution ( qkd ) has been introduced by bennett and brassard in 1984 @xcite following earlier ideas by wiesner @xcite . since then",
    ", this protocol ( bb84 for short ) has been implemented by several groups @xcite . for an overview containing more details about the background , the experimental implementation and the classical evaluation procedure",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the bb84 protocol is to use a random string of signal states which , for example , can be realized as single photons in horizontal , vertical , right circular , or left circular polarization states .",
    "these are two set of states which are orthogonal within each set , and have overlap probability @xmath0 between the sets .",
    "if the receiver chooses at random between a polarization analyzer for linear polarization and one for circular polarization , then they obtain in this way a _ raw key _",
    "@xcite . from this",
    "they distill the _ sifted key _ by publicly exchanging information about the polarization basis of the signals and the measurement apparatus .",
    "they keep only those bits where the basis is the same for the signal and the measurement , since those signals give a deterministic relation between signal and measurement outcome .",
    "the practical implementations deviate from the theoretical abstraction used in the original proposal in two important points .",
    "the first is that the signal states do not have the correct overlap probabilities . especially in the photonic realization , the signals contain contributions from higher photon numbers and from the vacuum state which cause this deviation .",
    "the second point is that the quantum channel in these implementations ( optical fibers ) shows a considerable loss .",
    "it has been shown earlier @xcite that the combination of the two effects open up a security gap .",
    "the extent of this security gap has been extensively illuminated for different signal sources in @xcite giving necessary conditions on the feasibility of qkdwithout restriction to any particular class of eavesdropping attacks . from these results",
    "one can conclude that most current experiments are performed in a parameter regime where the necessary conditions for security are violated .    in the present work",
    "i will complement these results by a positive proof of security for a scenario where the power of the eavesdropper is restricted to attacking signals separately ( individual attack ) .",
    "this restriction allows us to prove the security for a realistic protocol , i.  e.  one where all components are known and work efficiently .",
    "it is necessary to distinguish this work from earlier work by other groups . lo and chau @xcite gave a proof of principle for the security of quantum key distribution . at present , it is not possible to use their proof to implement secure qkd  since the procedure involves devices to manipulate qubits coherently in order to allow fault - tolerant computing .",
    "the approach of mayers @xcite is certainly the most advanced result towards practical qkd  which is provably secure against all eavesdropping attacks on the signals .",
    "however , the proof assumes ideal single photon signals , and , at present , we do not have an extension of that proof which can cope with realistic signal sources and effective error correction codes , although work in these directions is in progress .",
    "the restriction to eavesdropping on individual signals allows a much simpler analysis of a realistic scenario , and it is therefore advisable to use this scenario as a study for the generalization in the sense of mayer s proof .",
    "furthermore , the results are interesting in their own right : it seems to be impossible to perform collective measurements on the signals with today s technology .",
    "therefore , qkdsecure against individual attack will today create keys which are secure against future developments in coherent eavesdropping strategies , since tomorrows technology can not be used for todays eavesdropping strategy .",
    "this is in contrast to the implication of an increase of future computation power or improvements in algorithms which threatens todays use of classical encryption schemes .    in this paper",
    "i will derive a formula for the gain of secure bits per signal sent , that is per time slot of the experiment .",
    "these formulas are presented only in the limit of long keys , so that the influence of the necessary authentication of the key and all statistical influences regarding the number of errors etc .  can be neglected .",
    "it is necessary to embed these results into a full protocol , derived , for example , in @xcite to which i refer the reader for further details .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ singlephoton ] i will introduce the essential elements of practical quantum cryptography and report the relevant findings for single photon signals .",
    "these results are then extended in sec .",
    "[ multiphoton ] to signal sources which generate the signal states by rotating a state in one polarization to that of the ideal bb84 polarizations . in sec .",
    "[ exploring ] , the resulting gain formula is explored for two choices for the signal source , namely weak coherent pulses ( wcp ) and parametric downconversion ( pdc ) .",
    "the results are discussed in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "to investigate the security of qkd  one needs to investigate the trade - off between the information gathered by the eavesdropper and the amount of disturbance caused thereby .",
    "the trade - off between the shannon mutual information and the bit error rate in the sifted key has been investigated by several author for restricted attacks @xcite and for the general individual attack @xcite .",
    "the results show that the gathered shannon information for the typically observed error rate of about @xmath1@xmath2% is too high to allow the sifted key to be used directly for cryptographic purposes . however , we can first correct the errors and then apply the technique of _ generalized privacy amplification _ @xcite to distill from the sifted key a new shorter key , which fulfills the security requirements",
    ". these techniques are purely classical .",
    "both steps , the error correction and the privacy amplification , will reduce the number of gained secure bits .",
    "error correction is performed by the exchange of redundant information about the key , e.g. in form of parity bits , via the public channel .",
    "since eve has access to the public channel , we have to take care of this flow of side - information .",
    "this can be done by using a short initial shared secret key to encrypt the parity bits in a one - time pad method .",
    "note that in practice we can not realize any public channel which is safe against tampering by eve by technology alone .",
    "therefore , sender and receiver need to share a secret key anyway to overcome this problem by the classical method of authentication @xcite . as a consequence of this method of control of the side - information",
    ", we need to know how many bits need to be encrypted , which is equivalent to the number of exchanged parity bits .",
    "it is clear , that one has to be careful to implement an efficient error correction protocol , since we have to regain at least the number of secret bits used for the encryption of the parity bits .",
    "the ratio between minimum number of redundant bits @xmath3 needed to correct a key of length @xmath4 is given according to shannon @xcite by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the observed error rate in the sifted key . in this limit the probability that the errors can be corrected can come arbitrarily close to unity .",
    "however , shannon s proof of the existence of error correction codes reaching this limit is not constructive , and the limit is obtained only by large codes .",
    "these are not easily implemented because of the required computational resources .",
    "we have therefore to search for error correction tools which come close to this limit . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", it is hard even to approach the shannon limit with error correction codes which use uni - directional classical communication only .",
    "fortunately , a more efficient bi - directional code exists @xcite , which uses @xmath7\\ ;   n^{\\rm shannon}_{\\rm corr}$ ] bits for error correction with a correction factor @xmath7 $ ] listed in table [ brassardsalvail ] .",
    ".[brassardsalvail ] example of the performance of the bi - directional error reconciliation protocol by brassard and salvail @xcite .",
    "the values are taken from that paper . here",
    "@xmath6 is the observed error rate , while @xmath7 $ ] is the ratio of actually needed redundant bits to the corresponding number of the shannon limit .",
    "( i used the upper bounds for @xmath8 provided in the reference . ) [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     when we keep all parameters fixed and vary the expected photon number of the signal , we obtain a gain curve with a clear maximum . furthermore ,",
    "if the the photon number is too low , we can not obtain a positive gain because of the dark count rate of bob s detector . on the other hand , for large photon numbers we can not obtain a positive gain because of the high multi - photon probability for the signals .",
    "we concentrate on the optimal choice of the expected photon number which yields the maximal gain rate .",
    "now we can vary the length of the transmission line .",
    "the resulting graphs are shown in figure [ wcpgain ] .",
    "we see that the gain rate drops roughly exponentially with the length of the transmission before it starts to drop faster due to the increasing influence of the dark counts .",
    "the initial behavior is mainly due to the multi - photon component of the signals while the influence of the error - correction part is small . in this regime",
    "we can bound the gain by the approximation @xmath9 this expression is optimized if we choose @xmath10 which fulfills @xmath11 since for a realistic setup we expect that @xmath12 , we find @xmath13 . in this approximation",
    "we find the approximate upper bound @xmath14 as the distance increases and the influence of the dark counts and the error correction grows , this approximation is no longer valid .",
    "instead , we find in the numerical simulations that the optimal photon number is even lower .",
    "note that in the real experiments much higher photon number have been used .",
    "typically , these higher photon numbers do not allow secure key distribution over the reported distances .",
    "the approximate situation described above illuminates another interesting feature . as noted in @xcite , technical limitations on detectors",
    "limit the distance over which we can perform secure qkd  with weak coherent pulses , and the presented security proof is in accordance with it .",
    "this limit can be stretched as the technology improves .",
    "however , the obtained distance is only one characteristic of a setup .",
    "another is the obtained rate .",
    "we find that the gain rate per time slot is limited already by the use of the poissonian photon number distribution and the loss in the optical fiber .",
    "we can evaluate eqn .",
    "( [ gapprox ] ) for perfect detection devices and get a bound 1 shown in fig .",
    "[ boundfigure ] in the case of the kth set - up .",
    "the gap between bound 1 and the exact result shows how much room is left for improvements of bob s detection apparatus .",
    "the bounds 2 and 3 take into account in addition to the fiber loss the loss in bob s detection device and the detection efficiency .",
    "we find that bound 3 is already a good approximation to the exact results , at least for short and medium distances .",
    "this shows that the multi - photon aspect is for these distances the dominating effect compared to the effect of error correction and the influence of eavesdropping on single - photon signals , which are responsible for the gap between bound 3 and the exact curve . in order to compare the performance of different setups",
    ", one would need to multiply the gain rate with the signal repetition rate of the set - up to obtain the rate of secret bits per second",
    ". this repetition rate may be vastly different for some applications , so that the gain rate shown in fig.[wcpgain ] is only a starting point in optimizing the secure bit rate for a specific application .",
    "however , it shows clearly the variation of the performance as the distance varies , including the maximal possible distance .",
    "the results of the previous section illustrates that the coverable distance for qkd  is limited .",
    "as shown explicitly in @xcite , this distance can be increased by the usage of other signal sources , especially by the use of parametric downconversion .",
    "note , however , that it has been shown there that even perfect single photon sources will lead to a limited coverable distance due to bob s dark count rate .",
    "i will discuss here only the use of parametric downconversion ( pdc ) as a triggering mechanism , although more sophisticated techniques using epr states are possible .",
    "for that we consider the non - degenerate parametric amplifier described by the parameter @xmath15 as the product of the coupling constant and the interaction time of the process .",
    "this creates the two - mode state @xcite @xmath16 and dark count rate @xmath17 .",
    "only coincidences between alice s and bob s detector will be taken into account when forming the sifted key .",
    "for a low dark count rate and a small parameter @xmath15 ( note that @xmath18 is the expected photon number in one mode ) we can neglect coincidences between dark counts and detection events and associate alice s detection event with the pom element @xmath19 the signal state conditioned on alice s detection event is then given by @xmath20 with the post - selection probability as normalization factor @xmath21 this gives us the photon number distribution of the signals which are obtained from this _ seed state _ by polarization rotation . from the photon number distribution",
    "we can calculate @xmath22 by summation and @xmath23 , via the photodetection formula @xcite as , @xmath24 \\left[1-(1-\\eta_t \\eta_{\\rm b})^n\\right ] \\tanh^{2 n } \\chi \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{p_{\\rm post } \\cosh^2 \\chi }   \\left [ \\frac{1}{1-\\tanh^2 \\chi } \\right .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{1-(1-\\eta_{\\rm t } \\eta_{\\rm b } ) \\tanh^2 \\chi }   -\\frac{1}{1-(1-\\eta_{\\rm a } ) \\tanh^2 \\chi } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left .",
    "+ \\frac{1}{1-(1-\\eta_{\\rm a})(1-\\eta_{\\rm t } \\eta_{\\rm b } ) \\tanh^2 \\chi } \\right ] \\ ; . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as in the case of the wcp  scenario , we are now in the position to calculate the gain rate of a setup from experimental parameters .",
    "the simulations use experimental values for the transmission line and detectors which are the same as in the wcp  case .",
    "there are two different scenarios : either the non - degenerate downconversion produces photons at the same frequency , or one can use downconversion with different frequencies such that the frequency of alice s photon has a wavelength convenient for detection , while the other photon s wavelength falls into one of the three telecommunication windows for optimal propagation along the fiber or open air . to illustrate the calculation we assumed the situation where one mode is adapted to the @xmath25 nm detectors of the british telecom experiment , while the signal mode is emitted in one of the four modes used already for the wcpcase .",
    "the results of this hypothetical experiment is shown in fig .",
    "[ pdcgain ] .",
    "we find an increase of the covered distance against the use of the wcpsource , but this happens at the expense of a lower rate per signal .",
    "to understand the decrease of the rate , we can now bound the maximal gain per time slot in correspondence to the calculation for weak coherent states .",
    "it is now convenient to introduce the expected photon number @xmath26 . in the optimal case ,",
    "alice s triggering detector is perfect ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) , and we neglect the negative contribution of privacy amplification and error correction",
    ". then we find , again using @xmath29 , @xmath30 so that we find for the gain @xmath31 now the optimal mean photon number @xmath32 satisfies @xmath33 which leads for small values of @xmath34 to @xmath35 . in the same limit the gain rate is approximated by @xmath36 this bounds the obtainable rate for the case that bob s detectors are perfect , so that @xmath37 .",
    "we find that here weak coherent states have a potential gain rate per time slot which is twice as big as the one of parametric down conversion .",
    "the reason is that the photon number distribution for pdc  sources is basically thermal , which shows a higher multi - photon contribution compared to a poisson distribution with the same mean photon number . for practical realization ,",
    "however , a factor of two is not that significant , and the gap between gain rate of secure bits with imperfect tools is still by orders of magnitude separated from this limit .",
    "therefore the question remains open , which technology allows a simpler approach to higher rates .",
    "note that one would need to take into account the loss occurring when alice couples the photon for bob into a fiber .",
    "this loss can be easily incorporated in this calculations since the resulting photon number distribution of the signals can be obtained using the photon count formulas . here",
    ", however , we do not study this additional parameter .",
    "the corresponding formulas are given in appendix [ finiteetac ] .",
    "in this paper i presented a security proof of quantum cryptography which is restricted to individual attacks .",
    "this proof takes into account the non - ideal signal sources and detectors .",
    "moreover , it allows to compare the performance for different arrangements with respect to the overall gain rate . in this sense",
    "it can help to decide which type of source to use , for example weak coherent pulses or downconversion , depending on the available technology and the task fixing , for example , wavelength and distance . for existing experiments ,",
    "it allows to find the optimal mean photon number of the source and the optimal working point for bob s detectors .",
    "we found that the use of pdc  sources with a simple triggering mechanism does not increase the overall rate of secure bits , but it allows to increase the distance which can be covered by experiments .",
    "the rate could be improved by a more sophisticated detection mechanism , where alice could , at least partly , determine the number of pairs produced in a time slot . even if this mechanism does not work perfectly",
    ", it would improve the rate and distance .",
    "our examples show that the use of wcp  sources gives , typically , higher rates per time slot than the use of pdc  sources , as long as the distance is not too big .",
    "i would like to point out again , that in the end the total rate , that is the rate per time slot times the repetition rate of the set - up , is what counts .",
    "it depends therefore on the bottle - neck of the set - up which design can be made the fastest .    the problem of non - ideal sources in the presence of loss is known since 1995 .",
    "there have been proposals to use strong reference pulses in the two - state protocol @xcite and the bb84 protocol @xcite , but so far these ideas have not been implemented .",
    "the reference pulses make it more difficult for eve to block signals , since in those schemes bob measures the interference of the strong reference pulse with the weak signal , so that the absence of the weak signal will lead to an error in half of the cases .",
    "i would like to point out , that the security of this scheme has not been fully analyzed yet even for individual attacks , but this scheme is certainly the hope for the future to improve the here analyzed bb84 protocol .",
    "i would like to thank mohamed bourennane , gilles brassard , mila duek , nicolas gisin , richard hughes , bruno huttner , hitoshi inamori , anders karlsson , tal mor , and paul townsend for many discussions on the issue of security of realistic quantum key distribution .",
    "furthermore , i took benefit from the 1998 quantum information workshops at isi ( italy ) and the benasque center for physics ( spain ) and wish to thank their organizers and elsag - bailey for support .",
    "this work has been supported by the project 43336 of the academy of finland and by the european science foundation ( qit programme ) .",
    "the photon number splitting idea has been presented already in @xcite . here",
    "i want to provide more details .",
    "to perform photon number splitting , eve performs a quantum non - demolition measurement on the total photon number in both polarization modes . as a result",
    "the signal is now described by a @xmath4-photon state in the unknown and undisturbed signal polarization , and the photon number @xmath4 is known to eve .",
    "the task is now to find a unitary transformation @xmath38 , which depends on the value of @xmath4 , such that precisely one photon from the two signal polarization modes @xmath39 is transferred to two additional polarization modes @xmath40 which are in eve s hand .",
    "the polarization of either part should be equal to the original one .",
    "this means we require that the two signals of the first polarization basis ( @xmath41 ) transform as @xmath42 here the components of the state vector @xmath43 correspond to the photon number occupation of the modes @xmath44 respectively .",
    "the requirement for the two signal states of the second polarization basis @xmath45 is easily formulated if we choose the mode representation defined by the operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the state vector @xmath48 now denotes the occupation number in the modes @xmath49 .",
    "we require , that @xmath50    indeed , a transformation @xmath38 with these properties can be found @xcite .",
    "eve uses an interaction described by a jaynes - cummings hamiltonian @xmath51 to connect the signal modes to a three level system with one ground state @xmath52 and two upper states @xmath53 with atomic excitation operators @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) @xcite .",
    "( for a review of the jaynes - cummings model see @xcite . )",
    "the system is initially prepared in the ground state .",
    "after an interaction time @xmath56 , which depends on @xmath4 , the first two signal states transform into @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the same dynamics involving two additional photonic modes , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and the hamiltonian @xmath61 transfers ( after interaction time @xmath62 ) the excitation to a photon in the original polarization into the modes @xmath40 . in total",
    "we have then achieved the transformations ( [ trafopart1 ] ) while the three - level system factors out . as shown , this mechanism works fine for the first two signal states . to see that it works for",
    "the other states as well note that we can introduce a new description of the three level system with the superpositions of the upper levels as new excited states so that @xmath63 are the new atomic operators .",
    "then we find that the hamiltonians , written with these new atomic operators and with the photonic operators in the base @xmath45 , have the form @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we see , the hamiltonians are form invariant under the the above transformations , and it follows that this scheme performs the mapping of ( [ trafopart2 ] ) as well . in general , this scheme is able to split one photon off any @xmath4-photon state with definite polarization , regardless what this polarization may be .",
    "in this appendix i provide the straightforward derived formulas for the case where we use a parametric downconversion source for the triggering of the signal , and the signal travelling to bob couples only with a finite efficiency @xmath66 into the fiber .",
    "all losses on alice s side which can not be accessed by eve can be incorporated into this efficiency . conditioned on a click in alice s triggering detector",
    "we find the following results : @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 \\ ; . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with these quantities we can , as before , determine the optimal gain for a given setup ."
