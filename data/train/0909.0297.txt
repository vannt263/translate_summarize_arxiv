    "the jets of radio - loud agn carry energy and matter out from the nucleus to cluster - sized lobes , over distances of hundreds of kpc .",
    "while found in only @xmath2 of agn , jets can have a power output ( including both luminosity and kinetic energy flux ) comparable to that of the host galaxy and agn @xcite , and can profoundly influence the evolution of their host galaxy and nearby neighbors .",
    "agn jets are completely ionized flows , and the radiation we see from them is non - thermal in nature . that the radio emission arise from synchrotron radiation is supported by strong linear polarization and power - law spectra seen in both lower- and higher - power jets . however , at higher energies",
    ", the nature of the emission from higher - power large - scale jets is less clear .    in low - power fr",
    "i radio galaxies , the optical and x - ray fluxes fit on extrapolations of the radio spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and high polarizations are seen in the optical ( typically @xmath3 , @xcite ) suggesting synchrotron emission .",
    "these jets exhibit a wide variety of polarization properties @xcite , often correlated with x - ray emission .",
    "for example , in the jet of m87 @xcite , a strong anti - correlation between x - ray emission and optical polarization was found in the knots , accompanied by changes in the magnetic field direction , suggesting a strong link between the jet s dynamical structure and high - energy processes in the jet interior , where shocks compress the magnetic field and accelerate particles in situ .    for the more powerful fr  ii and quasar jets , the nature of both the optical and x - ray emission is under active debate .",
    "in many fr  ii jets , the optical emission can lie well below an interpolation between the radio and x - rays ( e.g. , @xcite ) , sometimes by decades ( e.g. , pks  0637@xmath1752 , @xcite ) , resulting in a characteristic double - humped shape of spectral energy distribution . in some jets the optical emission appears linked to the x - ray emission by a common component .",
    "this is the case in both 3c  273 and pks  1136@xmath1135 , where deep hst , chandra and spitzer imaging @xcite has shown that a second component , distinct from the lower - energy synchrotron emission , arises in the near - ir / optical and dominates the jet emission at optical and higher energies , at least up to 10 kev .",
    "competing mechanisms have been proposed : either synchrotron radiation from very high - energy particles or inverse - comptonization ( see @xcite ) , however , the nature of this component can not be constrained by multi - waveband spectra alone @xcite .",
    "polarimetry is a powerful diagnostic for jets because synchrotron emission is naturally polarized , with the inferred direction of the magnetic field vector indicating the weighted direction of the magnetic field in the radiating volume . in fr",
    "iis , where the radio - optical spectrum can not be neatly extrapolated to the x - rays , high - energy synchrotron emission requires a second electron population .",
    "the existence of such a component would drastically alter our picture of fr  ii jets , which until recently were not believed to accelerate electrons to @xmath4 .",
    "this would require highly efficient particle acceleration mechanisms that can operate well outside the host galaxy ( e.g. , in pks  1136@xmath1135 the x - ray emitting knots are at projected distances of @xmath5 kpc from the agn ) .",
    "if the optical and x - ray emission is synchrotron radiation , the optical polarization will be high , comparable to that seen in the radio , but with characteristics that may be linked to acceleration processes .",
    "the second possibility is inverse - comptonization of cosmic microwave background photons ( ic - cmb ) , @xcite .",
    "this requires a jet that remains highly relativistic out to distances of hundreds of kpc @xcite , viewed within a few degrees of the line of sight .",
    "any optical ic - cmb would be linked to nearly cold electrons , with @xmath6 , a population of particles that has never been tracked before .",
    "if the emitter is moving at relativistic bulk speeds , @xmath7 , then the forward - bunching effect will make the cmb photons essentially unidirectional in the jet frame",
    ". the ic scattering on the unidirectional and unpolarized photon beam by high - energy electrons having large lorentz factors ( @xmath8 ) should be unpolarized . on the other hand , the scattered radiation by cold electrons ( @xmath9",
    "; so - called bulk comptonization ) in the jet is expected to be highly polarized @xcite .",
    "we have carried out calculations covering the intermediate regime with @xmath10  few , making use of the general expression for the intensity and polarization of singly - scattered comptonized radiation presented by @xcite .",
    "we found that , for a power - law energy distribution of electrons with a cutoff at @xmath11 , the polarization degree can be as large as @xmath12 with the direction of the electric field vector perpendicular to the jet axis ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a second comptonization process is also possible .",
    "this is synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) radiation , in which the seed photons come from the jet s low - frequency radio emission . while ssc is unavoidable , it is unlikely to dominate the x - ray emission of the jet knots because in order to fit the observed x - ray emission , one requires a jet that is massively out of equipartition ( by factors of @xmath13 ) .",
    "however , ssc is the leading scenario for x - ray emission from the terminal hotspots of powerful jets @xcite .",
    "ssc predicts optical polarization properties similar to that of the lowest - frequency radio emission .",
    "polarization observations have now been done with hst for the jet of pks  1136@xmath1135 . in figure  1",
    ", we show the stokes i image from those observations . in table 1 , we give polarization properties for the jet components in apertures shown in figure  1 .",
    "we will discuss the details of the observations and data reduction procedures in a future paper .",
    "knot  a is shown to be highly polarized , with fractional polarization @xmath14 , and an inferred magnetic field vector close to that seen in the radio .",
    "knot  b , however , is weakly polarized , with @xmath15 at @xmath16 and only in the central region of the knot . moreover ,",
    "the magnetic field vector in knot  b is perpendicular to the direction seen in radio .",
    "this indicates that different emission mechanisms dominate in these two regions in the optical as well as x - rays .",
    "knot  a is clearly dominated by synchrotron emission up to energies of @xmath17 .",
    "this is the first time high - energy synchrotron emission has been proven for any quasar jet at distances of kiloparsecs from the agn .",
    "knot  b , however , is consistent with the ic - cmb mechanism dominating .",
    "for the first time we also detect knots  @xmath18 , c , and d in optical . knot  @xmath18 , like knot  b , is weakly polarized with the direction of the magnetic field vector perpendicular to the one seen in radio , while knots  c and d are highly polarized ( @xmath19 ) with magnetic field position angle ( mfpa ) similar to the one in radio in agreement with the synchrotron radiation being the primarily emission mechanism in these knots in optical ."
