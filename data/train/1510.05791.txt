    "the motion along the @xmath27 axis of a given point of the cantilever , within one of its flexural modes ( see fig .",
    "1(a ) of main text ) , can be described by the displacement function : @xmath110 here , @xmath111 is the modal coordinate and @xmath112 defines the x - dependent modal shape .",
    "we set @xmath113 and @xmath114 respectively as the clamped end and the free end of the cantilever . by definition @xmath115 , while @xmath116 depends on a normalization factor .",
    "we choose the normalization @xmath117 , so that @xmath111 coincides with the displacement of the free end of the cantilever .",
    "notice that this coincides also with the displacement of the microsphere , which is the experimentally measured quantity .",
    "analytical expressions of the modal shape can be calculated in the eulero - bernoulli approximation and can be found in many textbooks on elastic bodies .",
    "we follow the procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite , which provides the modal shape of the flexural modes of a mass - loaded cantilever .",
    "in particular , the modal shape of the fundamental mode of the cantilever used in this work is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : modeshape ] .",
    "a quantity which is relevant to this work is the effective mass @xmath118 of the cantilever mode , as seen from its free end .",
    "this is defined by the expression @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the physical mass and : @xmath121 it is straightforward to verify that the total kinetic energy within the mode vibration is given by @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the velocity of the free end .",
    "in other words , @xmath119 is the effective mass of the cantilever if we choose to describe it as a mass rigidly oscillating with amplitude @xmath111 . on the other hand , the entire physical mass @xmath124 of the microsphere moves rigidly by a displacement @xmath125 .",
    "the total resonating mass @xmath126 referred to the free end ( which appears for instance in eq .",
    "( 7 ) of the main text ) is then @xmath127 .",
    "the fact that the cantilever is not a rigid - body poses a difficulty in computing the collapse strength @xmath50 defined in eq .",
    "( 3 ) of the main text , which can be determined only for rigid - body motions ( strictly speaking , the center - of - mass master equation ( 2 ) is well - defined only for a rigid - body system ) .",
    "there is no easy way to cope with this situation , other than doing a numerical analysis of the full problem , or approximating the real motion with an appropriate rigid body motion .",
    "we choose the second approach , since the final bound on @xmath11 is significant at level of order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , we mimick the real motion of the cantilever with a cuboid which moves up and down rigidly , together with the sphere , with amplitude @xmath111 . according to the argument provided above , the effective cantilever motional mass which is rigidly moving by @xmath111",
    "is given by the fraction @xmath128 of the total cantilever mass .",
    "we then assume that the rigid cuboid mimicking the cantilever s motion has the length @xmath129 along the @xmath93-axis , while the size along the other two directions ( not affected by the elastic motion ) is the same as that of the real cantilever .",
    "notice that this choice is equivalent to approximate the real modal shape with a unit - step function modal shape , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : modeshape ] , with same effective mass .",
    "the csl collapse strength is given by eq .",

    "1(a ) of the main text , and considering the discussion in the previous section , the hybrid system can be described as a rigid - body system with the following density : @xmath135 with @xmath136 the mass density of the cuboid , and @xmath137 that of the sphere : @xmath138 where @xmath139 m , @xmath140 m , @xmath141 m , @xmath142 m ( see fig.1(a ) of the main text ) , @xmath143 is the uniform density of the cuboid , @xmath144 the uniform density of the sphere and @xmath145 is the heaviside step function . inserting the above densities into eq .",

    "s3-s6 we single out the contribution @xmath147 of the sphere , @xmath149 of the cuboid and the mixing term @xmath153 , respectively .",
    "as we can see , for @xmath154 , the contribution of the sphere is dominant .    to understand this behaviour ,",
    "let us consider two limiting cases for @xmath155 as given in eqs .   and  .",
    "for @xmath156 m , one finds : @xmath157 due to the geometry and mass density of the objects in our specific situation , the two contributions are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "note the quadratic dependence on @xmath1 : by increasing the correlation length , the number of nucleons , which contribute coherently to the collapse , increases , making the effect stronger .",
    "for very small values of @xmath1 ( comparable or smaller than interatomic distances ) , the approximation of a rigid body with a uniform density breaks down , and our formulas can not be used any more .    on the other hand , for @xmath158 m",
    ", one gets : @xmath159 now the contribution of the sphere to the collapse strength is largely dominant .",
    "this is because in this limit only the total number of nucleons becomes important ; and in our case the sphere has more nucleons than the cuboid .",
    "note the quadratic dependence on the number of nucleons : all of them contribute coherently to the collapse .",
    "note also the inverse quadratic dependence on @xmath1 : for larger and larger values of the correlation length , there is no further coherent contribution to the collapse , which then becomes weaker ."
