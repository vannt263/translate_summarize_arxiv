    "lattice simulation of gauge theory is of great importance since it provides a non - perturbative approach . for the supersymmetric systems , both theoretical formulation on the lattice and simulation techniques are now rapidly developing ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review and refs .",
    "@xcite for recent related works ) .",
    "one of the mysterious points of supersymmetry ( susy ) is that it is broken in our universe , although it is widely believed that susy is a relevant symmetry beyond the standard model . because susy is such a strong symmetry , it is difficult to break it spontaneously in perturbative calculations , unless it is broken at the tree level .",
    "the lattice simulation will help to understand the non - perturbative effects for the susy breaking .",
    "in a recent work  @xcite , on the basis of a formulation by sugino  @xcite the author together with suzuki explicitly confirmed that lattice artifacts which break supersymmetry in fact disappear in the continuum limit .",
    "the target system was two - dimensional @xmath0 super yang - mills theory ( for other lattice formulations of this system , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in order to suppress the fluctuation along the flat direction , we added scalar mass terms and numerically observed the partially conserved supercurrent ( pcsc ) relation , which is the conservation law of the supercurrent modified by the scalar mass .",
    "furthermore , we illustrated some physical applications , power - like behavior of certain correlation functions and static potential between fundamental probe charges  @xcite .",
    "the vacuum energy is the order parameter for susy breaking  @xcite and we are interested in the spontaneous susy breaking of this system .",
    "hori and tong  @xcite pointed out the possibility of spontaneous breaking while the previous simulation presented in refs .",
    "@xcite was consistent with no susy breaking .",
    "the vacuum energy obtained by the above simulation , however , had a rather large error because of an inefficient simulation algorithm .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to measure the vacuum energy with a small error which would help to determine whether supersymmetry is spontaneously broken or not in this system .",
    "we need , of course , to separate the spontaneous supersymmetry breaking from a breaking caused by lattice artifacts .",
    "the result in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the latter does not survive in the continuum limit .",
    "the target two - dimensional system is a nice arena for simulation of supersymmetric systems , although it is a toy system from a viewpoint of phenomenologically realistic four dimensional models .",
    "since it is two - dimensional , computational cost is less than four - dimensional case .",
    "furthermore , there is no sign problem in the continuum target theory , which also makes simulation easy .",
    "important differences from four - dimensional @xmath3 supersymmetric yang - mills   are the existence of massless scalar fields and the existence of flat directions in the classical potential .",
    "we use the lattice model in ref .",
    "@xcite and the method proposed in refs  @xcite to measure the vacuum energy .",
    "the action of the target @xmath0 super yang - mills theory is obtained by dimensional reduction from 4-dimensional @xmath3 super yang - mills theory . in the euclidean continuum spacetime , it is @xmath4 here , @xmath5 and @xmath6 run from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 are the gamma matrices in four dimensions and @xmath10 is the charge conjugation matrix .",
    "the covariant derivative @xmath11 is @xmath12 $ ] , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are two - dimensional gauge fields , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are real scalar fields .",
    "the field strength is @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "the fermion @xmath19 is a 4 component spinor and @xmath20 is a bosonic auxiliary field .",
    "the gauge coupling @xmath2 has mass dimension @xmath21 and we use it as a unit for dimensionful quantities .",
    "the action is invariant under four super transformations and one can rewrite it in a supercharge exact form .",
    "the lattice action we use is @xmath22  @xcite , where @xmath23 is the lattice version of ( [ eq : continuum_action ] ) and has one exact nilpotent symmetry @xmath24 at finite lattice spacings out of four supercharges  @xcite .",
    "@xmath25 , which softly breaks the supersymmetry as well as @xmath24-symmetry , is needed to lift the flat direction of the potential , because otherwise the simulation does not give thermalized configurations @xcite .",
    "we thus _ define _ the system as an extrapolation in which the scalar mass  @xmath26 goes to  @xmath7 after taking continuum limit . in taking the continuum limit",
    ", we use fixed scalar mass in a physical unit .",
    "the vacuum energy is the order parameter for susy breaking .",
    "it is positive if and only if susy is spontaneously broken .",
    "therefore it is of crucial importance to choose the correct origin of the energy .",
    "our choice is to use a @xmath24-exact hamiltonian ( density ) . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the author together with his collaborators discussed that this choice is consistent with a property of the witten index .",
    "they also confirmed that this method reproduces known results for supersymmetric quantum mechanics .",
    "for the current system , the hamiltonian density is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the 0-th component of the noether current corresponding to another supercharge @xmath29 .",
    "note that @xmath24 and @xmath29 satisfy the super algebra @xmath30 in the continuum . since we do not have a lattice version of the @xmath29  transformation , we use a naive discretization of the continuum current ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for its explicit expression ) .",
    "we do not include the scalar mass term in the hamiltonian density because the noether current @xmath31 does not contain it .",
    "the hamiltonian density is exactly identical to the one treated in refs  @xcite .",
    "we utilize the temperature as a conjugate external field to the hamiltonian , i.e. , we impose antiperiodic boundary condition ( apbc ) for fermion fields in time direction .",
    "we use a finite spacial size @xmath32 and temporal size @xmath33 , where @xmath33 is the inverse temperature as well .",
    "what we measure is @xmath34 where we explicitly indicate the boundary condition .",
    "@xmath35 denotes an integration measure of the path integral .",
    "if we adopted the periodic boundary condition , since the expectation value of hamiltonian would be proportional to a derivative of the witten index w.r.t the coupling constant , the expectation value would be always zero  .",
    "numerically , one will encounter a severe sign problem caused by sign ( or complex phase ) of the pfaffian . ] .",
    "therefore , we could not obtain useful information for the susy breaking .",
    "we will take the zero temperature limit at the final stage to obtain the vacuum energy density : @xmath36  , we use the values at @xmath37 and @xmath38 for all @xmath33 .",
    "the hamiltonian density is smoothly extrapolated for each @xmath33 . see fig .",
    "[ fig : massless ] and related descriptions . ] .",
    "we evaluate the expectation value  ( [ eq : expectation - value ] ) using a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the detail of generating the configurations is found in refs .",
    "we use the rational hybrid monte carlo ( rhmc ) method together with the multi - time step for molecular dynamics . compared with the method used in  @xcite , which uses quenched configurations and reweighting method to treat the fermion effect ,",
    "the statistical error is well under control .",
    "the effect of the complex phase of the pfaffian of the dirac operator is taken into account by phase reweighting of the square root of the determinant .",
    "note that the target system in the continuum has real positive pfaffian . because our choice of the lattice spacing is small enough and the argument of the determinants",
    "is distributed around zero , there is almost no sign ambiguities caused by taking the square root . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pfs ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : dets ] , we plot the distribution of the argument of the determinant and a sample distribution from a direction calculation of the pfaffian  . fig .",
    "[ fig : pfs ] shows that the pfaffian is almost real and positive   even for the largest lattice spacing and the lowest temperature , and guarantees the replacement of pfaffian by the positive ( i.e. , the real part is positive ) square root of the determinant .",
    "note that the direct calculation of the pfaffian is numerically very expensive . from fig .",
    "[ fig : dets ] , one can see that as the lattice spacing becomes small the determinant and hence the pfaffian approaches real and positive values , which is consistent with the property in the continuum .",
    "+    in the measurement , we calculate the hamiltonian density every  10 trajectories .",
    "we use binning technique ( a typical bin size is  5 ) and use the jack - knife method to estimate the statistical error for each parameters .",
    "the continuum limit is taken as a linear extrapolation w.r.t .",
    "the lattice spacing  @xmath39 .",
    "the massless extrapolation is taken as a linear extrapolation w.r.t .",
    "we use @xmath41 fit and estimate the statistical error of the fitting parameters as the value for which @xmath41 increases by @xmath21 .",
    "the common parameters are the following .",
    "we use su(2 ) gauge group .",
    "physical spacial size  @xmath32 is fixed to @xmath42 .",
    "the parameter @xmath43 for the admissibility condition in @xmath23 is @xmath44 .",
    "we list the detailed parameters and raw results in table  [ table : table ] . for large  @xmath33",
    ", we use 3 different lattice spacings to obtain the continuum limit while for small  @xmath33 we use 4 or more .",
    "it is because that in the former cases the obtained values are almost constant within the statistical error over the different lattice spacings ; in the latter cases they depend on the lattice spacing .    we estimate a systematic error in taking the continuum limit using the data set with @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cont_limit ] ) .",
    "although we adopt the linear fitting to obtain the continuum limit , we tried a quadratic function @xmath46 as well as a linear one @xmath47 in the lattice spacing  @xmath39 . after extrapolating @xmath48 , we obtained two different values and we regard the difference as the systematic error in choosing the fitting function , which is 4.0% . to estimate the errors associated with a choice of the fitting region , we repeated a similar analysis with linear fitting using small 4 lattice spacings and large 3 lattice spacings .",
    "comparing these two results with the one obtained from all 6 lattice spacings , we estimate the error associated with the choice of the fitting region at 6.8% . in total , the systematic error in taking the continuum limit is 11% .    after taking the continuum limit",
    ", we extrapolate the scalar mass  @xmath48 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : massless ] ) .",
    "as the figure indicates , a possible systematic error in the extrapolation is small compared with the statistical ones and thus is negligible .",
    "the final result is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] .",
    "we have fitted the result using two different functions : a power of  @xmath33 , @xmath49 , and an exponential of  @xmath33 , @xmath50 .",
    "we obtain @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "the errors are only statistical .",
    "the values of @xmath41 per degrees of freedom are @xmath57 and @xmath58 for 7 degrees of freedom , respectively . using the result of the fit by power function , we obtain @xmath59 for the central value and the statistical errors .    however , because the above fits use small  @xmath33 as well as large  @xmath33 , one can not exclude possible effects from the excited states .",
    "in fact , using only large @xmath33 ( @xmath60 ) , we obtain reliable fits for both exponential and power , which gives @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively   and @xmath63 . ] .",
    "these values are consistent with the above central value within the statistical error . using these values",
    ", we estimate that the systematic error in taking zero temperature limit is @xmath64 .",
    "what is the physical difference between the power and the exponential fitting ? if the spectrum has a gap , the energy behaves as an exponential function of @xmath33 .",
    "a power behavior of @xmath33 comes from gap - less excitations .",
    ", @xmath65 behaves as @xmath66 for large @xmath33 which gives @xmath67 . ] in a finite volume system , usually we have a discrete spectrum which leads to a mass gap .",
    "however , the current system has the _ flat direction _ in the potential at least in the classical level , and the fluctuation along the flat direction can provide a continuum spectrum .",
    "the current result does not allow us to determine which is the case   for @xmath60 is rather different from  @xmath68 and seems to prefer the exponential fit , we can not totally exclude the possibility of power function with the current error . ] .",
    "if the fit by the power was preferred , it would be an evidence of the recovery of the flat direction after the @xmath48 extrapolation .    in total",
    ", we obtain the vacuum energy @xmath69 , where the first error is the systematic and the second is the statistical one .",
    "it is consistent with @xmath7 within the error , that is , it is consistent with supersymmetry not being spontaneously broken .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this letter , we measured the vacuum energy of two - dimensional @xmath0 super yang - mills theory using lattice simulation . because our simulation does not have explicit supersymmetry breakings caused by lattice artifacts , the vacuum energy we measured works as an order parameter of _ spontaneous _ susy breaking .",
    "the result is consistent with  @xmath7 within the error , which seems to imply that supersymmetry is not spontaneously broken , although we can not exclude the possibility of a non - zero value smaller than the error which would indicate a spontaneous breaking of susy .",
