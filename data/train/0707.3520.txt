    "the study of the high redshift intergalactic medium ( igm ) has recently attracted increasing attention as the new generation of low frequency radio telescopes , , mwa and past/21cma , promises to open an unexplored observational window on the high-@xmath6 universe .",
    "in fact , these facilities should be able to detect the 21  cm line associated with the hyperfine transition of the ground state of neutral hydrogen , either in absorption or in emission against the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation ( see furlanetto , oh & briggs 2007 for a review on the topic ) . in order for the line to be visible , the spin temperature , which regulates the population of the levels , needs to be decoupled from the cmb temperature . while at @xmath7 collisions efficiently decouple the two temperatures , at lower redshift scattering with the ly@xmath0 photons emitted by the first stars is the most efficient process ( wouthuysen 1952 ; field 1959 ; hirata 2006 ; pritchard & furlanetto 2006 ) .",
    "in addition , ly@xmath0 photons could be able to heat the igm temperature above the cmb temperature and render the 21  cm line visible in emission .",
    "the advantage of ly@xmath0 photons over other heating sources , as x - rays ( unless the spectrum is very hard ) , is that the ly@xmath0 photons can travel cosmological distances and quickly build up a more homogeneous background .",
    "the impact of ly@xmath0 photon scattering on the evolution of the igm temperature has been recently revised by chen & miralda - escud ( 2004 ) and chuzhoy & shapiro ( 2007 ) .",
    "chen & miralda - escud ( 2004 ) included atomic thermal motion in their calculations , finding a heating rate several orders of magnitude lower than the previous estimate by madau , meiksin & rees ( 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , while `` continuum '' photons ( with frequency between the ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath8 ) heat the gas , `` injected '' photons ( which cascade into the ly@xmath0 from higher atomic resonances ) cool the gas , resulting in an effective cooling from ly@xmath0 photons at temperatures above 10  k. chuzhoy & shapiro ( 2007 ) though , showed that the cascade which follows absorption of photons in resonances higher than the ly@xmath0 happens via the 2s level rather than the 2p level . thus , the number of `` injected '' photons and their cooling efficiency are reduced compared to the estimate of chen & miralda - escud ( 2004 ) and ly@xmath0 photon scattering can be an efficient heating source also at temperatures higher than 10  k. as a consequence , ly@xmath0 photons could heat the igm above the cmb temperature and render the igm visible in 21  cm line emission .",
    "the igm heating from ly@xmath0 photons can also have a feedback effect on structure formation . in the standard cosmological scenario ,",
    "the first objects to collapse have typically small masses , corresponding to virial temperature @xmath9  k. the formation and evolution of these structures is heavily affected by feedback effects ( for a review see ciardi & ferrara 2005 ) .",
    "chuzhoy & shapiro ( 2007 ) have noted that objects with virial temperatures of few thousands degrees forming in an igm pre - heated by ly@xmath0 photons , would have a reduced post - collapse overdensity and would be more vulnerable to feedback effects such as molecular hydrogen dissociation and photoevaporation .",
    "all this makes it worthwhile to investigate further the effect of ly@xmath0 photons on the igm temperature evolution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we estimate the ly@xmath0 background expected from very high redshift stars ; in sections  3 and  4 we describe their effect on the igm temperature evolution and feedback on early structure formation ; in section  5 we discuss the impact on emission / absorption of 21  cm line and in section  6 we give our conclusions . throughout the paper",
    "we assume a @xmath10cdm cosmology with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "in this section we estimate the ly@xmath0 background , @xmath16 , expected from the first stars .",
    "dark matter decays and annihilations provide an additional contribution to @xmath16 ( e.g. valdes et al .",
    "2007 ) , but this becomes negligible once the first sources of radiation form ( valdes , private communication ) . for this reason we limit our estimate to the stellar component . at each redshift , the comoving specific emissivity from such stars , @xmath17 , is given by :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the formation rate of halos of total mass @xmath20 as given by the press - schechter formalism ( press & schechter 1974 ) , @xmath21 is the corresponding stellar mass and @xmath22 is the minimum mass of the halos . in this work",
    "we assume that stars can form in h@xmath23 cooling halos with virial temperature as low as @xmath24 k and for @xmath22 we use the parameterization adopted by santos , bromm & kamionkowski ( 2002 ) , @xmath25^{-3/2}$ ] .",
    "the stellar mass is related to the total halo mass by :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the star formation efficiency and @xmath28 is the fraction of baryons able to collapse ( see sec .  4 ) . in our fiducial case @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 is the template specific luminosity for a stellar population of age @xmath32 ( time elapsed between redshift @xmath33 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "we adopt the stellar spectra for metal - free stars computed by schaerer ( 2002 ) and two different initial mass functions ( imfs ) : a salpeter imf with lower / upper cut - off mass of 1/100  m@xmath1 , and a delta - function imf for very massive stars ( vms ) with mass 300  m@xmath1 . for completeness",
    ", we have also considered a case with pop  ii stars and a salpeter imf . although the ionizing photon production is much reduced ( by a factor of @xmath34 ) compared to metal - free stars with the same imf ,",
    "the ly@xmath0 photon emission is similar .",
    "for this reason we will limit our discussion to metal - free stars .",
    "the background intensity @xmath35 seen at a frequency @xmath36 by an observer at redshift @xmath37 is then given by : @xmath38    where @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the proper line element , @xmath41 is the effective optical depth at @xmath36 of the igm between redshift @xmath37 and @xmath6 ( see sec  2.2 of salvaterra & ferrara 2003 for a full description of the igm modeling ) and @xmath42 is provided by equation [ eq : ep ] .    in figure  [ emiss ]",
    "we plot ( dotted lines ) the evolution of the background intensity at the ly@xmath0 frequency , @xmath16 , ( left panels ) and the total number of photons between the ly@xmath0 and the ly - limit per baryon emitted by redshift @xmath6 , @xmath43 , ( right ) .",
    "a case with a vms and salpeter imf is shown in the upper and lower panels respectively . as expected ,",
    "although at the highest redshifts a vms imf produces more photons , a salpeter imf gives a higher photon density at @xmath44 because of the contribution from the small - mass long - living stars .",
    "in this section we calculate the evolution of the igm temperature , @xmath45 , induced by ly@xmath0 photon heating . note",
    "that our calculations assume that the gas is in a neutral state , the filling factor of ionized gas due to reionization is small . just for reference , assuming an escape fraction of ionizing photons of 10% , we find that 10 photons per baryon are emitted in the redshift range ( depending on other parameters adopted ) 12 - 14 ( 18 - 20 ) for a salpeter ( vms ) imf and 8 - 10 for pop  ii stars with a salpeter imf .",
    "@xmath45 is calculated with recfast ( seager , sasselov & scott 1999 ; 2000 ) until the first sources of radiation turn on .",
    "subsequently , we follow the method illustrated by chuzhoy & shapiro ( 2007 ) . here , we briefly summarize the relevant equations and we refer the reader to the original paper for more details . as the authors show that the presence of deuterium can affect the igm temperature ( its influence increasing with decreasing redshift and increasing @xmath43 ) , we have included d in our calculations .",
    "when ly@xmath0 resonance photons are the major heating source , the h and d temperature evolve as : @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the d energy loss rate from collisions with h , @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) is the number density of h ( d ) and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) is the heating rate per h ( d ) atom .",
    "the expressions for @xmath48 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 can be found in the original paper and a fit for the energy gain / loss from `` continuum''/``injected '' photons has been provided by l. chuzhoy ( chuzhoy private communication ) .",
    "the rates @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( the number of photons that pass through the ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath8 resonance per h atom per unit time , respectively ) necessary to calculate @xmath51 and @xmath52 have been derived from the model described in the previous section .",
    "our fiducial calculations assume a ratio of `` injected '' to `` continuum '' photons @xmath55 and a deuterium abundance of [ d / h]=@xmath56 .    in figure  [ temp ] the temperature evolution",
    "is plotted as a function of redshift for a vms ( upper panel ) and salpeter ( lower ) imf .",
    "the solid line represents the igm temperature calculated with recfast in the absence of ly@xmath0 heating , @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) is plotted with thin dotted ( dashed ) lines . as expected , the temperatures are higher with a salpeter imf , reflecting the behavior of the ly@xmath0 photon production ( see fig .",
    "[ emiss ] ) .",
    "as discussed in chuzhoy & shapiro ( 2007 ) , the most relevant resonance for deuterium is ly@xmath8 .",
    "they show that d ly@xmath8 photons have a negative color temperature and as a consequence , they are much more efficient than ly@xmath0 photons in heating the gas . in addition , differently from h ly@xmath0 photons , d ly@xmath8 photons efficiency as heaters increases with temperature . as a result",
    ", @xmath59 is higher than @xmath58 .",
    "we also find that the value of @xmath58 is independent of the presence of d. in the following , we will refer to @xmath58 indifferently as the hydrogen temperature or the igm temperature , @xmath60 .    to study the effect of the parameters adopted in our fiducial run , we have done additional calculations varying : _",
    "( i ) _ the abundance of d in the range [ d / h]= @xmath61 ; _ ( ii ) _ the ratio of `` injected '' to `` continuum '' photons in the range @xmath62 ; _ ( iii ) _ the star formation efficiency @xmath63 .",
    "we find that although @xmath59 strongly depends on [ d / h ] ( @xmath52 increases if [ d / h ] decreases ) , the presence of d does not affect @xmath58 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath58 slightly increases with decreasing @xmath64 ( because the cooling from the `` injected '' photons is less effective ) , but the changes are too small to be relevant for this study",
    ". a lower ( higher ) value of the star formation efficiency induces a smaller ( larger ) @xmath16 and gas temperature .",
    "in this section we will discuss the feedback effect of ly@xmath0 heating on the formation of small mass objects .    to study the impact of ly@xmath0 feedback we follow the method outlined by oh & haiman ( 2003 ) and compare the igm entropy , @xmath65 , with the entropy generated by gravitational shock heating , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is igm number density , while @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the virial temperature and the number density at the virial radius of a halo .",
    "the authors show that as the entropy parameter @xmath70 increases , the jeans smoothing effects due to the igm entropy become more significant , the central pressure and density of the halos decrease , together with the accreted gas fraction and gas clumping ( see also gnedin 2000 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the amount of gas going into stars is likely to decrease and the halo becomes more vulnerable to feedback effects such as molecular hydrogen dissociation and photoevaporation .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath71 has a minimum at @xmath72 , because of the higher halo density at @xmath73 . throughout this paper",
    "we will always be conservative and refer to the value at the virial radius .",
    "the value of @xmath74 depends on the halo profile and the entropy parameter can be written as : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the overdensity at the virial radius . for our fiducial",
    "runs we have adopted the value corresponding to a spherical top - hat collapse ( bryan & norman 1998 ) : @xmath77 where : @xmath78 for the cosmology adopted here @xmath79 .    to quantify the strength of such feedback , we plot in figure  [ entropy ] , as an example , the redshift evolution of the entropy parameter for halos with mass @xmath22 .",
    "the thick solid ( dotted ) lines refer to a salpeter ( vms ) imf . according to oh & haiman ( 2003 ) calculations ( see their fig .",
    "6 ) the fraction of gas , @xmath28 , within the virial radius of a halo with @xmath71 larger than 1 is smaller than 50% and as low as 1% for @xmath80 .",
    "thus , the fraction of gas collapsing in halos with mass equal to @xmath22 can be effectively reduced to few percents .",
    "so , to account for the effect of ly@xmath0 feedback in a self - consistent way , we repeat the same calculations adopting for @xmath28 in equation  [ eq : mstar ] the value corresponding to @xmath81 .",
    "this has the effect of lowering the amount of gas that goes into stars and thus the intensity of the ly@xmath0 background . the evolution of @xmath16 and @xmath43 when the coupling between the ly@xmath0 feedback and structure formation is included , is shown in figure  [ emiss ] as solid lines for @xmath79 .",
    "as expected , both @xmath16 and @xmath43 are reduced by the effect of feedback . as a consequence ,",
    "also the igm temperature is lower when the coupling is included ( thick lines in fig .",
    "[ temp ] ) .    given the igm temperature",
    ", we can derive the virial temperature corresponding to @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "halos with @xmath84 will be heavily affected by ly@xmath0 photon feedback . from @xmath83 one",
    "can derive the corresponding halo mass , @xmath85 . in figure  [ feed ] the mass evolution is shown as a function of redshift for a vms ( upper panel ) and salpeter ( lower ) imf .",
    "the solid lines represent the halo mass corresponding to @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath85 ( thick dotted lines ) is plotted together with @xmath22 ( dashed ) .",
    "the feedback from ly@xmath0 photons will greatly affect the formation and evolution of halos with mass below @xmath85 , in which only about 50% of the gas fraction will be able to collapse .",
    "the effect is stronger for a salpeter imf .",
    "it should be noted that the ly@xmath0 feedback will only affect the collapse of mini - halos , while the formation of halos collapsing via h - line cooling will proceed unaffected .    as mentioned above , the value of @xmath76 depends on the density profile of the halo .",
    "if a navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) profile is adopted , the density contrast at the virial radius for a halo with mass @xmath22 varies in the range @xmath86 , depending on the redshift . as a comparison",
    ", we have repeated the same calculations for @xmath87 and we show the evolution of @xmath16 and @xmath88 in figure  [ emiss ] with dashed lines . the effect on @xmath71 and @xmath85 can be seen as thin lines in figures  [ entropy ] and  [ feed ] .",
    "as expected , the impact of the ly@xmath0 feedback is reduced compared to the fiducial case , but it can still be appreciable .",
    "as already discussed in the introduction , heating of the igm from ly@xmath0 photons has important consequences for the observation of 21  cm emission line from neutral hydrogen . as the physics behind the",
    "emission / absorption of such line has been discussed extensively by several authors ( for a review see furlanetto , oh & briggs 2007 ) , here we just write the relevant equations",
    ". the evolution of the spin temperature , @xmath89 , can be written as ( chuzhoy & shapiro 2006 ) : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the cmb temperature ; @xmath92 is the coupling efficiency due to collisions with h atoms , electrons and protons , @xmath93  k is the temperature corresponding to the energy difference between the singlet and triplet hyperfine levels of the ground state of neutral hydrogen and @xmath94  s@xmath95 is the spontaneous emission rate . for the de - excitation rates",
    "@xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 we have adopted the fits used by kuhlen , madau & montgomery ( 2006 ; see also the original papers by smith 1966 ; allison & dalgarno 1969 ; liszt 2001 ; zygelman 2005 ) , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 with @xmath49 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 hydrogen , electron and proton number density , @xmath104  @xmath105  s@xmath95 and @xmath106 $ ] . finally , @xmath107 is the effective coupling efficiency due to ly@xmath0 scattering which takes into account the back - reaction of the resonance on the ly@xmath0 spectrum and the effect of resonant photons other than ly@xmath0 , and @xmath108 , with @xmath109  s@xmath95 radiative de - excitation rate due to ly@xmath0 photons .    in the upper panel of figure  [ temp21 cm ]",
    "the spin temperature is shown as a function of redshift together with @xmath91 and @xmath57 ( upper and lower dotted - dashed lines , respectively ) .",
    "the dotted line is @xmath89 in the absence of a ly@xmath0 background , while the solid ( dashed ) lines are for a salpeter ( vms ) imf with @xmath79 .",
    "the value of @xmath45 is hardly affected by the choice of @xmath76 , as the difference in the ly@xmath0 background is too small to result in an appreciable difference in temperature .",
    "for this reason , in the following we will discuss only the case with @xmath79 . in all cases the coupling with the ly@xmath0 feedback is included . in the absence of a ly@xmath0 background , @xmath89 gets coupled to @xmath91 at @xmath110 , once collisions becomes ineffective in maintaining @xmath111 . as the intensity required for a ly@xmath0 background to be effective in decoupling the spin temperature from @xmath91 is @xmath112  ergs  @xmath113  s@xmath95  hz@xmath95  sr@xmath95 ( ciardi & madau 2003 ) , @xmath89 gets coupled to @xmath57 as early as @xmath114 .    the differential brightness temperature , @xmath115 , between the cmb and a patch of neutral hydrogen with optical depth @xmath116 and spin temperature @xmath89 at redshift @xmath6 , can be written as : @xmath117 for a gas at the mean igm density , the optical depth is : @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the wavelength of the transition , @xmath120 is the number density of neutral hydrogen and @xmath121 is the hubble constant .    in the lower panel of figure  [ temp21 cm ] @xmath115 is plotted for the spin temperature calculated above , for a salpeter ( solid lines ) and a vms ( dashed ) imf , and in the absence of a ly@xmath0 background ( dotted ) . from figure  [ temp21 cm ]",
    "it is clear that , although ly@xmath0 photons are very efficient in decoupling the spin temperature from the cmb temperature , they are not able to heat the igm above @xmath122 before @xmath123 . thus ,",
    "if ly@xmath0 photons are the only heating source in the early universe and the reionization process is ongoing at very high redshift , we expect to observe the 21  cm line in emission only when the igm is substantially ionized , while at earlier times we expect to observe it in absorption . in the absence of feedback ,",
    "the heating by ly@xmath0 photons is effective in raising the igm temperature above @xmath122 already at @xmath124 .",
    "in this paper we have calculated the effect of ly@xmath0 photons emitted by the first metal - free stars on the evolution of the igm temperature .",
    "we have considered both a standard salpeter imf and a delta - function imf for very massive stars with mass 300  m@xmath1 .",
    "our calculations are run for a neutral gas at the mean density , thus they are strictly valid as long as the filling factor of ionized gas is small or in regions of the igm that have not been reached by ionizing radiation .",
    "we find that the ly@xmath0 photons produced by the stellar populations considered here are able to heat the igm at @xmath2 , although never above @xmath3  k ( thin lines in fig .  [ temp ] ) .",
    "stars with a salpeter imf are more effective as , due to the contribution from small - mass long - living stars , they produce a higher ly@xmath0 background",
    ".    ly@xmath0 heating can affect the subsequent formation of small mass objects by producing an entropy floor that may limit the amount of gas able to collapse .",
    "as shown in oh & haiman ( 2003 ) , as the entropy parameter increases , the jeans smoothing effects due to the igm heating become more significant , the central pressure and density of halos decreases as well as the accreted gas fraction and clumping , with the consequence of rendering these halos more vulnerable to molecular hydrogen dissociation and photoheating .",
    "we find that the gas fraction in halos of mass in the range @xmath125  m@xmath1 ( depending on redshift ) is less than 50% ( for the smallest masses this fraction drops to 1% or less ) compared to a case without ly@xmath0 heating .",
    "it should be noted that h - cooling halos ( i.e. @xmath126 k ) are not affected by this feedback .    to include the effect of feedback in a self - consistent way",
    ", we have repeated the same calculations adopting for the fraction of gas able to collapse in a halo , instead of unity , the value induced by the feedback effect .",
    "this results in an overall lower amount of collapsed gas and a lower value of the ly@xmath0 background and igm temperature ( thick lines in fig .  [ temp ] ) . to have a better understanding of the effects of ly@xmath0 heating on structure formation one should follow the collapse of a halo and determine the impact on the gas density profile and clumping , but",
    "this is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "many other feedback effects affect the formation and evolution of small mass halos in the early universe ( see ciardi & ferrara 2005 for a review ) , ranging from photoionization / evaporation , to molecular hydrogen dissociation , to blowout / blowaway .",
    "given the wide variety of feedback effects and the fact that often they are studied in specific cases , it is difficult to assess the relative importance of ly@xmath0 feedback . differently from other feedback effects though ( with the exception of molecular hydrogen dissociation ) , ly@xmath0 photons can travel cosmological distances and quickly build up a fairly homogeneous background .",
    "minihalo suppression from ly@xmath0 feedback may also have an important impact on the reionization history .",
    "the lower star formation rate due to reduced collapse gas mass results in a delay of the process . on the other hand ,",
    "ly@xmath0 feedback can have the opposite effect .",
    "the halo profiles are smoothed out and the gas clumping factor is consequently reduced , so that the reionization process may be speeded up by a faster photoevaporation of minihalos . the final effect on the reionization history",
    "requires dedicated studies ( see shapiro , iliev & raga 2004 , ciardi et al .",
    "2006 ) and is beyond the scope of our analysis .",
    "once the igm is heated by the ly@xmath0 photons above the cmb temperature , the 21  cm line associated with the hyperfine transition of the ground state of neutral hydrogen can be visible in emission against the cmb .",
    "this happens at @xmath5 , while at higher redshift , in the absence of other heating sources as x - rays , we expect to observe the line in absorption .",
    "thus , for the detection of the emission line , the reionization history becomes critical as the peak of the emission ( in terms of fluctuations of the differential brightness temperature ) is expected when roughly half of the volume is ionized but the ionized regions are not completely overlapped ( see ciardi & madau 2003 ) . to investigate this issue in more detail",
    "the reionization process should be studied together with the effect of ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "it should be noted that metal - enriched stars would induce the same effect on the igm temperature as metal - free stars with a salpeter imf . in this case",
    "though , the reionization process is delayed due to the much lower ionizing photon budget and the 21  cm line can be seen in emission over a longer redshift range .",
    "the same comment applies when a transition from an initially metal - free stellar population to metal - enriched stars takes place ( see schneider et al .",
    "2006 ) .    to summarize the main results of this work",
    ", we find that :    * the ly@xmath0 background from the first stars can heat the igm gas up to temperatures of @xmath3  k , depending on redshift and parameters adopted ; * the associate feedback lowers the gas fraction collapsed in halos of mass below @xmath4",
    "m@xmath1 to less than 50% ( for the smallest halos the fraction drops to 1% or less ) compared to the case without ly@xmath0 heating ; * ly@xmath0 photons heat the igm temperature above the cmb temperature and render the 21  cm line from neutral hydrogen visible in emission at @xmath5 .",
    "if ly@xmath0 feedback on small structures is neglected emission is already possible at @xmath124 .",

    "<S> in this paper we have calculated the effect of ly@xmath0 photons emitted by the first stars on the evolution of the igm temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we have considered both a standard salpeter imf and a delta - function imf for very massive stars with mass 300  m@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the ly@xmath0 photons produced by the stellar populations considered here are able to heat the igm at @xmath2 , although never above @xmath3  k. stars with a salpeter imf are more effective as , due to the contribution from small - mass long - living stars , they produce a higher ly@xmath0 background . </S>",
    "<S> ly@xmath0 heating can affect the subsequent formation of small mass objects by producing an entropy floor that may limit the amount of gas able to collapse and reduce the gas clumping . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the gas fraction in halos of mass below @xmath4  </S>",
    "<S> m@xmath1 is less than 50% ( for the smallest masses this fraction drops to 1% or less ) compared to a case without ly@xmath0 heating . </S>",
    "<S> finally , ly@xmath0 photons heat the igm temperature above the cmb temperature and render the 21  cm line from neutral hydrogen visible in emission at @xmath5 .    </S>",
