    "bohmian mechanics ( bm ) and the ghirardi  rimini  weber ( grw )",
    "theory are two quantum theories without observers , and thus provide two possible solutions of the measurement problem of quantum mechanics .",
    "however , they would seem to have little in common beyond achieving the goal of describing a possible reality in which observers would find , for the outcomes of their experiments , the probabilities prescribed by the quantum formalism .",
    "they are two precise , unambiguous fundamental physical theories that describe and explain the world around us , but they appear to do this by employing opposite strategies . in bohmian mechanics",
    "@xcite the wave function evolves according to the schrdinger equation but is not the complete description of the state at a given time ; this description involves further variables , traditionally called ` hidden variables , ' namely the particle positions . in the grw theory @xcite ,",
    "in contrast , the wave function @xmath0 describes the state of any physical system completely , but @xmath0 collapses spontaneously , thus departing from the schrdinger evolution .",
    "that is , the two theories choose different horns of the alternative that bell formulated as his conclusion from the measurement problem @xcite : ` either the wave function , as given by the schrdinger equation , is not everything , or it is not right . '",
    "the two theories are always presented almost as dichotomical , as in the recent paper by @xcite .",
    "our suggestion here is instead that bm and grw theory have much more in common than one would expect at first sight .",
    "so much , indeed , that they should be regarded as being close to each other , rather than opposite .",
    "the differences are less profound than the similarities , provided that the grw theory is understood appropriately , as involving variables describing matter in space - time .",
    "these variables we call the _ primitive ontology _ ( po ) of the theory , and they form the common structure of bm and grw . the gain from the comparison with bm is the insight that the grw theory can , and should , be understood in terms of the po .",
    "we think this view in terms of the po provides a deeper understanding of the grw theory in particular , and of quantum theories without observer in general .",
    "to formulate more clearly and advertise this view is our goal .    after recalling what bohmian mechanics is in section [ sec : bm ]",
    ", we introduce two concrete examples of grw theories in section [ sec : grw ] .",
    "these examples involve rather different choices of crucial variables , describing matter in space - time , and give us a sense of the range of possibilities for such variables .",
    "we discuss in section [ sec : po ] the notion of the _ primitive ontology _ ( po ) of a theory ( a notion introduced in @xcite ) and connect it to bell s notion of ` local beables ' @xcite . in section [ sec : morepo ] we relate the primitive ontology of a theory to the notion of physical equivalence between theories .",
    "we stress in section [ sec : symmetry ] the connection , first discussed in @xcite , between the primitive ontology and symmetry properties , with particular concern for the generalization of such theories to a relativistically invariant quantum theory without observers . in section [ sec : grw0 ] we argue that a theory without a primitive ontology is at best profoundly problematical .",
    "we proceed in sections [ sec : diff ] to an analysis of the differences between grw ( with primitive ontology ) and bm , and in section [ sec : differences ] we discuss a variety of possible theories .",
    "we consider in section [ sec : lgrwf ] a ` no - collapse ' reformulation of one of the grw theories and in section [ sec : bmc ] a ` collapse ' interpretation of bm .",
    "these formulations enable us to better appreciate the common structure of bm and the grw theories , as well as the differences , as we discuss in section [ sec : equiv ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : essential ] with a summary of this common structure .",
    "bohmian mechanics is a theory of ( nonrelativistic ) particles in motion .",
    "the motion of a system of @xmath1 particles is provided by their world lines @xmath2 , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the position in @xmath5 of the @xmath6-th particle at time @xmath7 .",
    "these world lines are determined by bohm s law of motion @xcite , @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath3 , are the masses of the particles ; the wave function @xmath0 evolves according to schrdinger s equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the usual nonrelativistic schrdinger hamiltonian ; for spinless particles it is of the form @xmath12 containing as parameters the masses of the particles as well as the potential energy function @xmath13 of the system .    in the usual yet unfortunate terminology ,",
    "the actual positions @xmath14 of the particles are the _ hidden variables _ of the theory : the variables which , together with the wave function , provide a complete description of the system , the wave function alone providing only a partial , incomplete , description . from the point of view of bm , however , this is a strange terminology since it suggests that the main object of the theory is the wave function , with the additional information provided by the particles positions playing a secondary role .",
    "the situation is rather much the opposite : bm is a theory of particles ; their positions are the primary variables , and the description in terms of them must be completed by specifying the wave function to define the dynamics .    as a consequence of schrdinger s equation and of bohm s law of motion ,",
    "the quantum equilibrium distribution @xmath15 is equivariant .",
    "this means that if the configuration @xmath16 of a system is random with distribution @xmath17 at some time @xmath7 , then this will be true also for any other time @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the _ quantum equilibrium hypothesis _ , which asserts that whenever a system has wave function @xmath18 , its configuration @xmath19 is random with distribution @xmath17 , can consistently be assumed .",
    "this hypothesis is not as hypothetical as its name may suggest : the quantum equilibrium hypothesis follows , in fact , by the law of large numbers from the assumption that the ( initial ) configuration of the universe is typical ( i.e. , not - too - special ) for the @xmath20 distribution , with @xmath21 the ( initial ) wave function of the universe @xcite .",
    "the situation resembles the way maxwell s distribution for velocities in a classical gas follows from the assumption that the phase point of the gas is typical for the uniform distribution on the energy surface .    as a consequence of the quantum equilibrium hypothesis , a bohmian universe , even if deterministic , appears random to its inhabitants .",
    "in fact , the probability distributions observed by the inhabitants agree exactly with those of the quantum formalism . to begin to understand why ,",
    "note that any measurement apparatus must also consist of bohmian particles .",
    "calling @xmath22 the configuration of the particles of the system to be measured and @xmath23 the configuration of the particles of the apparatus , we can write for the configuration of the big bohmian system relevant to the analysis of the measurement @xmath24 .",
    "let us suppose that the initial wave function @xmath0 of the big system is a product state @xmath25 .    during the measurement",
    ", this @xmath21 evolves according to the schrdinger equation , and in the case of an ideal measurement it evolves to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 runs through the eigenvalues of the observable measured , @xmath28 is a state of the apparatus in which the pointer points to the value @xmath27 , and @xmath29 is the projection of @xmath0 to the appropriate eigenspace of the observable . by the quantum equilibrium hypothesis , the probability for the random apparatus configuration @xmath30 to be such as to correspond to the pointer pointing to the value @xmath27 is @xmath31 . for a more detailed discussion",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the theory proposed by @xcite is in agreement with the predictions of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics as far as all present experiments are concerned @xcite ; for a discussion of future experiments that may distinguish this theory from quantum mechanics , see section  v of @xcite . according to the way in which this theory is usually presented",
    ", the evolution of the wave function follows , instead of schrdinger s equation , a stochastic jump process in hilbert space . we shall succinctly summarize this process as follows .",
    "consider a quantum system described ( in the standard language ) by an @xmath1-`particle ' wave function @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ; for any point @xmath35 in @xmath36 ( the ` center ' of the collapse that will be defined next ) , define on the hilbert space of the system the _ collapse operator _",
    "@xmath37 where @xmath38 is the position operator of ` particle ' @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath39 is a new constant of nature of order of @xmath40 m .",
    "let @xmath41 be the initial wave function , i.e. , the normalized wave function at some time @xmath42 arbitrarily chosen as initial time .",
    "then @xmath0 evolves in the following way :    1 .",
    "it evolves unitarily , according to schrdinger s equation , until a random time @xmath43 , so that @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the unitary operator @xmath46 corresponding to the standard hamiltonian @xmath11 governing the system , e.g. , given by ( [ eq : h ] ) for @xmath1 spinless particles , and @xmath47 is a random time distributed according to the exponential distribution with rate @xmath48 ( where the quantity @xmath49 is another constant of nature of the theory , should be chosen differently for every ` particle , ' with @xmath50 proportional to the mass @xmath9 . ] of order of @xmath51 s@xmath52 ) .",
    "2 .   at time",
    "@xmath53 it undergoes an instantaneous collapse with random center @xmath54 and random label @xmath55 according to @xmath56 @xmath55 is chosen at random in the set @xmath57 with uniform distribution .",
    "the center of the collapse @xmath54 is chosen randomly with probability distribution , is used to denote a random variable , while the the values taken by it are denoted by small letters ; @xmath58 is a shorthand for @xmath59 $ ] , etc . ]",
    "@xmath60 3 .",
    "then the algorithm is iterated : @xmath61 evolves unitarily until a random time @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is a random time ( independent of @xmath47 ) distributed according to the exponential distribution with rate @xmath48 , and so on .    in other words ,",
    "the evolution of the wave function is the schrdinger evolution interrupted by collapses .",
    "when the wave function is @xmath0 a collapse with center @xmath35 and label @xmath6 occurs at rate @xmath64 and when this happens , the wave function changes to @xmath65 .",
    "thus , if between time @xmath42 and any time @xmath66 , @xmath67 collapses have occurred at the times @xmath68 , with centers @xmath69 and labels @xmath70 , the wave function at time @xmath7 will be @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 since @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath67 are random , @xmath18 is also random .",
    "it should be observed that  unless @xmath42 is the initial time of the universe  also @xmath41 should be regarded as random , being determined by the collapses that occurred at times earlier that @xmath42 .",
    "however , _ given _",
    "@xmath41 , the statistics of the future evolution of the wave function is completely determined ; for example , the joint distribution of the first @xmath67 collapses after @xmath42 , with particle labels @xmath77 , is @xmath78 with @xmath79 and @xmath80 given , _ mutatis mutandis _ , by .",
    "this is , more or less , all there is to say about the formulation of the grw theory according to most theorists .",
    "in contrast , giancarlo ghirardi believes that the description provided above is not the whole story , and we agree with him .",
    "we believe that , depending on the choice of what we call the _ primitive ontology _ ( po ) of the theory , there are correspondingly different versions of the theory . we will discuss the notion of primitive ontology in detail in section [ sec : po ] . in the subsections below we present two versions of the grw theory , based on two different choices of the po , namely the _ matter density ontology _ ( in section  [ sec : grwm ] ) and the _ flash ontology _ ( in section  [ sec : grwf ] ) .      in the first version of the grw theory , denoted by grwm",
    ", the po is given by a field : we have a variable @xmath81 for every point @xmath82 in space and every time @xmath7 , defined by @xmath83 in words , one starts with the @xmath84distribution in configuration space @xmath85 , then obtains the marginal distribution of the @xmath6-th degree of freedom @xmath86 by integrating out all other variables @xmath87 , @xmath88 , multiplies by the mass associated with @xmath89 , and sums over @xmath6 .",
    "grwm was essentially proposed by ghirardi and co  workers in @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "the field @xmath90 is supposed to be understood as the density of matter in space at time @xmath7",
    ". since these variables are functionals of the wave function @xmath0 , they are not ` hidden variables ' since , unlike the positions in bm , they need not be specified in addition to the wave function , but rather are determined by it . nonetheless , they are additional elements of the grw theory that need to be posited in order to have a complete description of the world in the framework of that theory .",
    "grwm is a theory about the behavior of a field @xmath90 on three - dimensional space .",
    "the microscopic description of reality provided by the matter density field @xmath90 is not particle - like but instead continuous , in contrast to the particle ontology of bm .",
    "this is reminiscent of schrdinger s early view of the wave function as representing a continuous matter field .",
    "but while schrdinger was obliged to abandon his early view because of the tendency of the wave function to spread , the spontaneous wave function collapses built into the grw theory tend to localize the wave function , thus counteracting this tendency and overcoming the problem .",
    "a parallel with bm begins to emerge : they both essentially involve more than the wave function . in one",
    "the matter is spread out continuously , while in the other it is concentrated in finitely many particles ; however , both theories are concerned with matter in three - dimensional space , and in some regions of space there is more than in others .",
    "you may find grwm a surprising proposal .",
    "you may ask , was it not the point of grw  perhaps even its main advantage over bm  that it can do without objects beyond the wave function , such as particle trajectories or matter density ?",
    "is not the dualism present in grwm unnecessary ?",
    "that is , what is wrong with the version of the grw theory , which we call grw0 , which involves just the wave function and nothing else ?",
    "we will return to these questions in section [ sec : grw0 ] . to be sure , it seems that if there was nothing wrong with grw0 , then , by simplicity , it should be preferable to grwm .",
    "we stress , however , that ghirardi must regard grw0 as seriously deficient ; otherwise he would not have proposed anything like grwm .",
    "we will indicate in section [ sec : grw0 ] why we think ghirardi is correct .",
    "to establish the inadequacy of grw0 is not , however , the main point of this paper .",
    "according to another version of the grw theory , which was first suggested by @xcite , then adopted in @xcite , and here denoted grwf , the po is given by ` events ' in space - time called flashes , mathematically described by points in space - time .",
    "this is , admittedly , an unusual po , but it is a possible one nonetheless . in grwf matter is neither made of particles following world lines , such as in classical or bohmian mechanics , nor of a continuous distribution of matter such as in grwm , but rather of discrete points in space - time , in fact finitely many points in every bounded space - time region , see figure  [ flashes ] .    in the grwf theory , the space - time locations of the flashes can be read off from the history of the wave function given by and : every flash corresponds to one of the spontaneous collapses of the wave function , and its space - time location is just the space - time location of that collapse . accordingly , equation gives the joint distribution of the first @xmath67 flashes , after some initial time @xmath42 .",
    "the flashes form the set @xmath91 ( with @xmath92 ) .    in bell",

    "indeed each is centered on a particular spacetime point @xmath93 .",
    "so we can propose these events as the basis of the ` local beables ' of the theory .",
    "these are the mathematical counterparts in the theory to real events at definite places and times in the real world ( as distinct from the many purely mathematical constructions that occur in the working out of physical theories , as distinct from things which may be real but not localized , and distinct from the ` observables ' of other formulations of quantum mechanics , for which we have no use here ) .",
    "a piece of matter then is a galaxy of such events .",

    "note that if the number @xmath1 of the degrees of freedom in the wave function is large , as in the case of a macroscopic object , the number of flashes is also large ( if @xmath95 s@xmath52 and @xmath96 , we obtain @xmath97 flashes per second ) .",
    "therefore , for a reasonable choice of the parameters of the grwf theory , a cubic centimeter of solid matter contains more than @xmath98 flashes per second . that is to say that large numbers of flashes can form macroscopic shapes , such as tables and chairs . that is how we find an image of our world in grwf .",
    "note however that at almost every time space is in fact empty , containing no flashes and thus no matter .",
    "thus , while the atomic theory of matter entails that space is not everywhere continuously filled with matter but rather is largely void , grwf entails that at most times space is entirely void .    according to this theory ,",
    "the world is made of flashes and the wave function serves as the tool to generate the ` law of evolution ' for the flashes : equation gives the rate of the flash process the probability per unit time of the flash of label @xmath6 occurring at the point @xmath35 .",
    "for this reason , we prefer the word ` flash ' to ` hitting ' or ` collapse center ' : the latter words suggest that the role of these events is to affect the wave function , or that they are not more than certain facts about the wave function , whereas ` flash ' suggests rather something like an elementary event .",
    "since the wave function @xmath0 evolves in a random way , @xmath99 is a random subset of space - time , a point process in space - time , as probabilists would say .",
    "grwf is thus a theory whose output is a point process in space - time . and @xmath39 , and , as long as experiments have not fixed their values",
    ", this cell argument may indeed be an argument for a choice different from grw s original one ( say , with larger @xmath49 and larger @xmath39 ) . we do not wish to argue here for any particular choice .",
    "third , while most people might expect a cell to be real in much the same way as ( say ) a cat , one would not necessarily expect this of a single atom .",
    "thus , it seems quite conceivable that , at some critical scale between that of atoms and that of cats , the ontological character of objects changes  as indeed it does in grwf because of the limited resolution of matter given by the space - time density of flashes ( e.g. , in water approximately one flash every 20 micrometers every second ) .",
    "the cell example shows that the critical scale in grwf is larger than one might have expected , and thus that grwf is a mildly quirky picture of the world . but",
    "this mild quirkiness should be seen in perspective . in comparison , many other views about quantum reality are heavily eccentric , as they propose that reality is radically different from what we normally think it is like : e.g. , that there exist parallel worlds , or that there exists no matter at all , or that reality is contradictory in itself . ]",
    "we remark that grwm and grwf are empirically equivalent , i.e. , they make always and exactly the same predictions for the outcomes of experiments . in other words , there is no experiment we could possibly perform that would tell us whether we are in a grwm world or in a grwf world , assuming we are in one of the two .",
    "this should be contrasted with the fact that there are possible experiments ( though we can not perform any with the present technology ) that decide whether we are in a bohmian world or in a grw world .",
    "the reason is simple .",
    "consider any experiment , which is finished at time @xmath7 .",
    "consider the same realization of the wave function on the time interval @xmath100 $ ] , but associated with different primitive ontologies in the two worlds . at time @xmath7 , the result gets written down , encoded in the shape of the ink ; more abstractly , the result gets encoded in the position of some macroscopic amount of matter .",
    "if in the grwf ontology , this matter is in position 1 , then the flashes must be located in position 1 ; thus , the collapses are centered at position 1 ; thus , the wave function is near zero at position 2 ; thus , by the density of matter is low at position 2 and high at position 1 ; thus , in grwm the matter is also in position 1 , displaying the same result as in the grwf world .",
    "we will discuss empirical equivalence again in section [ sec : equiv ] .",
    "the matter density field in grwm , the flashes in grwf , and the particle trajectories in bm have something in common : they form ( what we have called ) the primitive ontology of these theories . the po of a theory  and its behavior is what the theory is fundamentally about .",
    "it is closely connected with what bell called the ` local beables ' :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ [ i]n the words of bohr , ` it is decisive to recognize that , however far the phenomena transcend the scope of classical physical explanation , the account of all evidence must be expressed in classical terms ' .",

    "the only reason the wave function is of any interest at all is that it is relevant to the behavior of the po . roughly speaking",
    ", the wave function tells the matter how to move . in bm",
    "the wave function determines the motion of the particles via equation , in grwm the wave function determines the distribution of matter in the most immediate way via equation , and in grwf the wave function determines the probability distribution of the future flashes via equation .",
    "we now see a clear parallel between bm and the grw theory , at least in its versions grwm and grwf .",
    "each of these theories is about matter in space - time , what might be called a decoration of space - time .",
    "each involves a dual structure @xmath101 : the po @xmath102 providing the decoration , and the wave function @xmath0 governing the . the wave function in each of these theories , which has the role of generating the dynamics for the po , has a nomological character utterly absent in the po",
    "this difference is crucial for understanding the symmetry properties of these theories and therefore is vital for the construction of a lorentz invariant quantum theory without observers , as we will discuss in section [ sec : symmetry ] .",
    "even the copenhagen interpretation ( orthodox quantum theory , oqt ) involves a dual structure : what might be regarded as its is the classical description of macroscopic objects which bohr insisted was indispensable  including in particular pointer orientations conveying the outcomes of experiments  with the wave function serving to determine the probability relations between the successive states of these objects . in this way",
    ", @xmath0 governs a , even for oqt .",
    "an important difference , however , between oqt on the one hand and bm , grwm , and grwf on the other is that the latter are fully precise about what belongs to the ( particle trajectories , respectively continuous matter density or flashes ) whereas the copenhagen interpretation is rather vague , even noncommittal , on this point , since the notion of ` macroscopic ' is an intrinsically vague one : of how many atoms need an object consist in order to be macroscopic ? and , what exactly constitutes a ` classical description ' of a macroscopic object ?",
    "therefore , as the example of the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics makes vivid , an adequate fundamental physical theory , one with any pretension to precision , must involve a po defined on the microscopic scale .      to appreciate the concept of po",
    ", it might be useful to regard the positions of particles , the mass density and the flashes , respectively , as the _ output _ of bm , grwm and grwf , with the wave function , in contrast , serving as part of an _ algorithm that generates this output_. suppose we want to write a computer program for simulating a system ( or a universe ) according to a certain theory .",
    "for writing the program , we have to face the question : which among the many variables to compute should be the output of the program ?",
    "all other variables are internal variables of the program : they may be necessary for doing the computation , but they are not what the user is interested in . in the way we propose to understand bm , grwm , and grwf , the output of the program , the result of the simulation , should be the particle world lines , the @xmath90 field , respectively the flashes ; the output should look like figure  [ flashes ] .",
    "the wave function , in contrast , is one of the internal variables and its role is to implement the evolution for the output , the po of the theory .",
    "moreover , note that there might be different ways of producing the same output , using different internal variables .",
    "for example , two wave functions that differ by a gauge transformation generate the same law for the po . in more detail , when ( external ) magnetic fields are incorporated into bm by replacing all derivatives @xmath103 in and by @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the vector potential and @xmath106 is the electric charge of particle @xmath107 , then the gauge transformation @xmath108 does not change the trajectories nor the quantum equilibrium distribution . as another example ,",
    "one can write the law for the po in either the schrdinger or the heisenberg picture . as a consequence , the same law for the po is generated by either an evolving wave function and static operators or a static wave function and evolving operators .",
    "in more detail , bm can be reformulated in the heisenberg picture by rewriting the law of motion as follows : @xmath109|\\psi \\rangle}}{{\\langle \\psi|p(dq , t)|\\psi \\rangle } } ( q = q(t))\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the hamiltonian ( e.g. , for @xmath1 spinless particles given by ) , @xmath110 is the ( heisenberg - evolved ) position operator ( or , more precisely , triple of operators corresponding to the three dimensions of physical space ) for particle @xmath6 and @xmath111 is the projection  valued measure ( pvm ) defined by the joint spectral decomposition of all ( heisenberg - evolved ) position operators @xcite .",
    "we suggest that two theories be regarded as _ physically equivalent _ when they lead to the same history of the po .",
    "conversely , one could define the notion of po in terms of physical equivalence : the po is described by those variables which remain invariant under all physical equivalences .",
    "we discuss this issue in more detail in sections [ sec : lgrwf ] and [ sec : bmc ] , when presenting some examples .    what is ` primitive ' about the primitive ontology ?",
    "that becomes clear when we realize in what way the other objects in the theory ( such as the wave function , or the magnetic field in classical physics ) are non  primitive : one can explain what they are by explaining how they govern the behavior of the po , while it is the entities of the po that make direct contact with the world of our experience .",
    "we can directly compare the motion of matter in our world with the motion of matter in the theory , at least on the macroscopic scale .",
    "the other objects in the theory can be compared to our world only indirectly , by the way they affect the po .",
    "but that deserves a thorough analysis that will be undertaken in a separate work @xcite . ]",

    "@xmath121 since the trajectories of the po transformed according to the symmetry are still solutions , bm is symmetric under galilean transformation , even though the corresponding wave function has to undergo more than a simple change of variables in order to make this possible . * ` _  and the possible probability distributions on the histories , those that are allowed by the theory  _ ' in a deterministic theory ,",

    "the case of grwf is analogous : a probability distribution for the flashes @xmath124 is possible if induced by for some wave function @xmath0 . * ` _  when transformed according to the symmetry , will again be possible probability distributions for the theory . _ '",

    "the action of a transformation on every history determines the transformation of a probability distribution on the space of histories . as in the deterministic case",

    "going back to the work of bell mentioned in the beginning of this section @xcite , what bell had to do for grwf , and what he did , was to confirm the invariance under relative time translations of the stochastic law for @xmath124 , the galaxy of flashes .",
    "and more generally the invariance of grwf directly concerns the stochastic law for the po ; it concerns the invariance of the law for the wave function only indirectly , contrary to what is often , erroneously , believed . under a space - time symmetry",
    "the po must be transformed in accord with its intrinsic geometrical nature , while wave functions ( and other elements of the non - primitive ontology , if any ) should be transformed in a manner dictated by their relationship to the po .",
    "moreover , note that there is no reason to believe that when changing the po of a theory the symmetry properties of the theory will remain unchanged .",
    "actually , the opposite is true .",
    "this fact was pointed out in @xcite and has recently been emphasized also in @xcite , in which it has been shown that grwf , without interaction , can be modified so as to become a relativistic quantum theory without observers .",
    "( entailing suitable collapse ) while leaving open the law for the po .",
    "finally , note that for grwm and bm it is not known how to make them `` seriously '' relativistic , i.e. without the incorporation of additional structure that yields a foliation of space - time . ] in that paper the stochastic law for the galaxy of the flashes in space - time , the po of grwf , with suitably modified , lorentz - invariant equations , has been shown explicitly to be relativistically invariant ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "hence , grwf is lorentz invariant , but grwm is not .",
    "thus , one should not ask whether grw as such is lorentz invariant , since the answer to this question depends on the choice of po for grw . for details see @xcite .",
    "similar results to those of @xcite have been obtained also by @xcite for a relativistic collapse theory on the lattice ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we conclude with some remarks on oqt . here",
    "the relevant po consists , rather vaguely of course , of the ` pointer variables ' registering the results of experiments that are spoken of as measurements of quantum observables .",
    "though oqt provides neither detailed histories of the po nor probability distributions thereof , it does provide probability distributions for the results of measurements registered by the po , which are given by the appropriate spectral measures for the self - adjoint operators representing the observables .",
    "in particular , the mean value of the result of the measurement @xmath134 of the quantum observable represented by the self - adjoint operator @xmath105 for a system in the state @xmath0 is @xmath135    now consider the action of a symmetry on the experiment @xmath136 : it transforms @xmath134 to the experiment @xmath137 arising from the natural action of the symmetry on the physical processes defining @xmath138 .",
    "if @xmath134 is a measurement of the operator @xmath105that is , if the probability distribution of the results of @xmath134 are given by the spectral measures for @xmath105then @xmath137 will be a measurement of the operator @xmath139 arising from @xmath105 under the symmetry . while @xmath138 and @xmath137 are of course ( usually ) different experiments , it is obvious from their relationship that the distribution of the results of @xmath134 when the system is in the state @xmath0 is the same as the distribution of the results of @xmath137 when the transformed system is in the transformed state @xmath125 . in particular , where @xmath134 is a measurement of @xmath105",
    ", we have that @xmath140 according to the analysis of @xcite and @xcite , these transformations on wave functions and operators are given by unitary or anti - unitary operators @xmath141 , i.e. , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , where @xmath141 is an element of a unitary - projective representation of the symmetry group .",
    "note that while the distribution of the _ result _ of the experiment is , for trivial reasons , unaffected by the symmetry transformation , the macroscopic po is in fact transformed .",
    "for example , a rotated experiment will involve a rotated ` pointer position , ' or a rotated computer printout .",
    "but what the pointer is pointing to , and what the printout says , will not change .",
    "in other words , the numerical result @xmath144 of an experiment @xmath134 should not be confused with the macroscopic configuration @xmath145 of the pointer variables , the po of oqt , the former being indeed a function of the latter , i.e. , @xmath146 , with the function @xmath147 expressing the ` calibration ' of the experiment . in @xmath137 , the rotated experiment , the po ( the pointer orientation ) changes together with the calibration : the pointer points in a different direction @xmath148 and the scale @xmath147 is rotated into @xmath149 such that @xmath150 .",
    "thus , when all is said and done , although the po of oqt is rather vague and imprecise , insofar as symmetry is concerned the situation is indeed analogous to that of theories , such as bm or grwf , having a clear and exactly specified po : also for oqt the possible probability distributions on the po , those that are allowed by the theory , when transformed according to the symmetry , will again be possible probability distributions for the theory .",
    "now let us turn to the question : what is wrong with grw0 , the bare version of grw , which involves just the wave function and nothing else ?",
    "why does one need a po at all ?",
    "our answer is that we do not see how the existence and behavior of tables and chairs and the like could be accounted for without positing a primitive ontology  a description of matter in space and time .",
    "the aim of a fundamental physical theory is , we believe , to describe the world around us , and in so doing to explain our experiences to the extent of providing an account of their macroscopic counterparts , an account of the behavior of objects in @xmath151-space .",
    "thus it seems that for a fundamental physical theory to be satisfactory , it must involve , and fundamentally be about , ` local beables , ' and not just a beable such as the wave function , which is non - local : in the words of @xcite    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ [ ... ] the wave function as a whole lives in a much bigger space , of @xmath152 dimensions .",

    "for example , formulations of classical mechanics utilizing configuration space @xmath85 or phase space @xmath153 ( such as euler ",
    "lagrange s or hamilton s ) are connected to a po in 3-space ( particles with trajectories ) by the definitions of configuration space and phase space .",
    "if , as we believe , a po given by local beables is so crucial for a theory to make sense as a fundamental physical theory , one might wonder how grw0 could be taken seriously by so many serious people ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one reason , perhaps , is that if the wave function @xmath0 is suitably collapsed , i.e. , concentrated on a subset @xmath154 of configuration space such that all configurations in @xmath154 look macroscopically the same , all corresponding for example to a pointer pointing in the same way , then we can easily imagine what a world in the state @xmath0 is macroscopically like : namely like the macrostate defined by configurations from @xmath154 .",
    "for example , when in the wave function is concentrated near @xmath155 , where @xmath155 is a configuration describing a pointer pointing to the value @xmath156 , it is easy to feel justified in concluding that there is a pointer that is pointing to the value @xmath156 , and to forget that we are dealing with a theory for which there exists no arrangement of stuff in physical three - dimensional space at all .",
    "since the macroscopic description does not depend on whether the po consists of world lines , flashes , or a continuous distribution of matter , and since the reasoning does not even mention the po , it is easy to overlook the fact that a further law needs to be invoked , one which prescribes how the wave function is related to the po , and implies that for wave functions such as described , the is such that its macroscopic appearance coincides ( very probably ) with the macroscopic appearance of configurations in @xmath154 . to overlook this step is even easier when focusing very much on the measurement problem , whose central difficulty is that the wave function of object plus apparatus , if it evolves linearly , typically becomes a superposition of macroscopically distinct wave functions like @xmath0 which thus contains no hint of the actual outcome of the experiment .",
    "[ sec : po3n ]    interestingly enough , after having underlined the importance of local beables for a fundamental physical theory , bell proposed grw to be about ` stuff ' in configuration ( @xmath152-dimensional ) space . in his celebrated analysis of the quantum measurement problem @xcite , he wrote :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the grw - type theories have nothing in their kinematics but the wavefunction .",

    "this is perhaps unnecessary , since universal mass densities that differ only by a multiplicative constant are arguably physically equivalent .",

    "we have stressed the similarity between bm and grw .",
    "there are , of course , also significant differences .",
    "perhaps the most obvious is that in bm the schrdinger evolution is exact , but not in grw .",

    "in fact we will present in section [ sec : lgrwf ] a reformulation of grwf in which the schrdinger evolution is exact .",

    "a difference in the mathematical structure of grwf ( and oqt ) on the one hand and bm ( but also grwm ) on the other concerns the probability distribution that each of the these theories defines on its space of histories of the po .",
    "this probability distribution is a quadratic functional of the initial @xmath0 for grwf and oqt , but not for bm and grwm .",
    "this feature is at the origin of why grwf can be modified so as to become a fully relativistically invariant theory ( see the end of section [ sec : symmetry ] ) .",
    "it will be discussed in the following subsection , which , however , will not be needed for understanding the rest of the paper .",
    "it is worth noting a feature of the mathematical structure of grwf that it shares with oqt , but that is absent in , for example , bm and grwm .",
    "it concerns the dependence on the ( initial ) wave function @xmath0 of the probability distribution @xmath163 that the theory defines on its space @xmath164 of histories of the po . in bm , @xmath164 is the space of continuous paths in configuration space @xmath85 , and the measure @xmath165 corresponds to the quantum equilibrium measure , and is concentrated on a @xmath152-dimensional submanifold of @xmath164 , namely the solutions of bohm s equation . in grwf",

    "in grwm , @xmath164 is a space of fields on space - time , and @xmath165 the image under the mapping @xmath167 given by of the distribution of the markov process @xmath168 .    in grwf and oqt , but not in bm or grwm , @xmath165 is a quadratic functional of @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , in grwf and oqt it is of the form @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the positive - operator - valued measure ( povm ) on @xmath164 that can be read off from for grwf , and is the povm associated with the results of a sequence of measurements for oqt ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "neither grwm nor bm share this property . the easiest way of seeing this begins with noting that entails that any two ensembles of wave functions ( corresponding to probability measures @xmath171 on the unit sphere @xmath154 of hilbert space ) with the same density matrix , @xmath172 lead to the same distribution @xmath173 on @xmath164 .",

    "one can say that the essence of this difference between these theories lies in different choices of which quantity is given by a simple , namely quadratic , expression in @xmath0 :    * the probability distribution @xmath165 of the history of the po both in grwf and oqt , see * the probability distribution @xmath181 of the po at time @xmath7 in bm , @xmath182 * the po itself at time @xmath7 in grwm , @xmath183    note in particular the rather different roles that ` @xmath84 ' can play for different quantum theories and different choices of the po .      in section [ sec : bm ] we have recalled the notion of the equivariance of the probability distribution @xmath84 and indicated how it is the key notion for establishing the empirical agreement between bm and the predictions of the quantum formalism ( whenever the latter are unambiguous ) .",
    "the equivariance of @xmath84 expresses the mutual compatibility , with respect to @xmath84 , of the schrdinger evolution of the wave function and the bohmian motion of the configuration .",

    "however , the concept of the equivariance of the distribution @xmath84 is not directly applicable in this case : in fact , for grwf there is no random variable @xmath19 whose distribution could agree or disagree with a @xmath17 distribution ( or any other quantum mechanical distribution ) , since grwf is a theory of flashes , not particles , and as such yields no nontrivial random variable that can be regarded as associated with a fixed time @xmath7 . in this framework",
    "it seems natural to consider the notion of a time ",
    "translation equivariant distribution , in terms of which we may provide a generalized notion of equivariance as follows : let @xmath184 be the space of possible histories of the po for times greater than or equal to @xmath7 . in trajectory theories like bm , @xmath184 is the space of continuous paths @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is the configuration space ; in flash theories like grwf it is the space of finite  or ",
    "countable subsets of the half space - time @xmath187 .",
    "consider an association @xmath188 where @xmath163 is a probability measure on @xmath189 that is compatible with the dynamics of the theory .",
    "we say that this association is _ equivariant _ relative to a deterministic evolution @xmath190 if @xmath191 , where @xmath192 denotes the action of the mapping on measures and @xmath193 is a suitably defined time shift .",
    "properly , let @xmath194 , be the restriction mapping @xmath195 , and @xmath196 the time translation mapping @xmath197 .",

    "bm is equivariant relative to the schrdinger evolution , and grwf and grwm are equivariant relative to the grw evolution .",
    "one may wonder whether some primitive ontologies ( flashes and continuous matter density ) work only with grw - type theories while others ( particle trajectories ) work only with bohm - type theories .",
    "this is not the case , as we shall explain in this section .",
    "let us analyze , with the aid of table 1 , several possibilities :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ defaulttable ]    there can be at least three different kinds of primitive ontologies for a fundamental physical theory , namely particles , fields , and flashes .",
    "those primitive ontologies can evolve either according to a deterministic or to a stochastic law and this law can be implemented with the aid of a wave function evolving either stochastically or deterministically .",
    "bm is the prototype of a theory in which we have a particle ontology that evolves deterministically according to a law specified by a wave function that also evolves deterministically .",
    "the natural analog for a theory with particle ontology with indeterministic evolution is stochastic mechanics ( sm ) , in which the law of evolution of the particles is given by a diffusion process while the evolution of the wave function , the usual schrdinger evolution , remains deterministic ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "another example involving stochastically evolving particles with a deterministically evolving wave function is provided by a bell - type quantum field theory ( btqft ) in which , despite the name , the po is given by particles evolving indeterministically to allow for creation and annihilation ( for a description , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another possibility for a stochastic theory of particles is a theory grwp in which the particle motion is governed by but with a wave function that obeys a grw - like evolution in which the collapses occur exactly as in grw except that , once the time and label for the collapse has been chosen , the collapse is centered at the actual position of the particle with the chosen label , rather than at random according to equation .",
    "( a garbled formulation of this theory is presented in @xcite . )",
    "what in table 1 we call a bohmian quantum field theory ( bqft ) involves only fields , evolving deterministically @xcite .",
    "another example is provided by the theory sm in which the po is given by the mass density field but evolving with a schrdinger wave function  always evolving according to schrdinger s equation , with no collapses .",
    "grwm provides an example of a theory of fields that evolve stochastically .",
    "concerning theories with flashes , these are inevitably stochastic , and grwf , in which the flashes track the collapses of the wave function , is the prototype .",
    "however , there are also theories with flashes in which the wave function never collapses .",
    "such theories are thus arguably closer to bm than to grwf .",
    "we consider two examples .    in the first example , denoted by sf , the po consists of flashes with their distribution determined by a schrdinger wave function @xmath201 , that evolves always unitarily , as in bm , according to the @xmath1`particle ' schrdinger evolution .",
    "the flashes are generated by the wave function exactly as in grwf .",
    "thus , the algorithm , whose output is the flashes , is the same as the one described in section [ sec : grw ] , with steps 1 .",
    ", 2 . and 3 . , with the following difference : the first sentence in step 2 . is dropped , since no collapse takes place .",
    "in other words , in sf flashes occur with rate but are accompanied by no changes in the wave function . ]",

    "our last example ( sf@xmath208 ) is the following .",
    "consider a nonrelativistic system of @xmath1 noninteracting quantum particles with wave function satisfying the schrdinger equation @xmath209 and suppose that , as in grwf , each of the flashes is associated with one of the particle labels @xmath210 .",
    "given the flashes up to the present , the next flash occurs with rate @xmath48 , and has a label @xmath211 that is randomly chosen with uniform distribution .",

    "the reason that this model is assumed to be noninteracting is precisely to guarantee the existence of the multi - time wave function in .",
    "sf@xmath208 is an example of a theory with a flash ontology that arguably is empirically equivalent to oqt ( unlike grwf)at least , it would be if it were extended to incorporate interactions between particles  and avoids the many - worlds character of sf ( see section [ subsec : swamw ] below ) .",
    "a provisional moral that emerges is that relativistic invariance might be connected with a flash ontology , since grwf is the only theory in table 1 ( except for sm and sf , which have a rather extraordinary character that we discuss in section [ subsec : swamw ] below ) of which we know how it can be made relativistically invariant without postulating a preferred foliation of space - time ( or any other equivalent additional structure ) .",
    "finally , note that all the theories in table 1 are empirically equivalent ( suitably understood ) to oqt except grwm , grwf , and grwp .      a rather peculiar theory representing the world as if it were , at any given time , a collection of particles with classical configuration @xmath222 is bell s version of many - worlds ( bmw ) @xcite . in bmw",

    "sm , though they are simple mathematical modifications of grwf and grwm respectively , provide very different pictures of reality , so different indeed from what we usually believe reality should be like that it would seem hard to take these theories seriously . in sf and sm , apparatus pointers never point in a specific direction ( except when a certain direction in oqt would have probability more or less one ) , but rather all directions are , so to speak , realized at once . as a consequence , one",
    "is led to conclude that their predictions do nt agree with those of the quantum formalism .",
    "still , it can be argued that these theories do not predict any _",
    "observable _ deviation from the quantum formalism : there is , arguably , no conceivable experiment that could help us decide whether our world is governed by sf or sm on the one hand or by the quantum formalism on the other .",
    "the reason for this surprising claim is that sf and sm can be regarded as many - worlds formulations of quantum mechanics .",
    "let us explain .    at first glance , in an sf or sm world",
    ", the after - measurement state of the apparatus seems only to suggest that matter is very spread out .",
    "however , if one considers the flashes , governed by the rate , or the mass density , that correspond to macroscopic superpositions , one sees that they form independent families of correlated flashes or mass density associated with the terms of the superposition , with no interaction between the families .",
    "the families can indeed be regarded as comprising many worlds , superimposed on a single space - time .",
    "metaphorically speaking , the universe according to sf or sm resembles the situation of a tv set that is not correctly tuned , so that one always sees a mixture of two channels . in principle",
    ", one might watch two movies at the same time in this way , with each movie conveying its own story composed of temporally and spatially correlated events .",
    "thus sf and sm are analogous to everett s many - worlds ( emw ) formulation of quantum mechanics @xcite , but with the ` worlds ' explicitly realized in the same space - time . since the different worlds do not interact among themselves ",
    "they are , so to speak , reciprocally transparent  this difference should not be regarded as crucial .",
    "thus , to the extent that one is willing to grant that emw entails no observable deviation from the quantum formalism , the same should be granted to sf and sm .",
    "moreover , contrarily to emw , but similarly to bmw , sf and sm have a clear po upon which the existence and behavior of the macroscopic counterparts of our experience can be grounded .",
    "this ontological clarity notwithstanding , in sf and sm reality is of course very different from what we usually believe it to be like .",
    "it is populated with ghosts we do not perceive , or rather , with what are like ghosts from our perspective , because the ghosts are as real as we are , and from their perspective we are the ghosts .",
    "we plan to give a more complete discussion of sf and sm in a future work .",
    "we note that the theory sm is closely related to  if not precisely the same as  the version of quantum mechanics proposed by @xcite .",

    "schrdinger s rejection of this theory was perhaps a bit hasty .",

    "in this section we elaborate on the notion of physical equivalence by considering physically equivalent formulations of and for which the laws of evolution of the wave function are very different from the standard ones .",
    "we conclude with some remarks on the notion of empirical equivalence .      as a consequence of the view that the grw theory is ultimately not about wave functions but about either flashes or matter density , the process @xmath18 in hilbert space ( representing the collapsing wave function )",

    "as we point out in this section , it is not necessary to regard the wave function in grwf as undergoing collapse ; instead , one can formulate grwf in such a way that it involves a wave function @xmath0 that evolves linearly ( i.e. , following the usual schrdinger evolution ) .",

    "is given by @xmath225 observe that @xmath18 , given by equation , is determined by @xmath41 and the flashes @xmath226 that occur between the times @xmath42 and @xmath7 ; it can be rewritten as follows : @xmath227 where we have introduced the heisenberg - evolved operators ( with respect to time @xmath7 ) @xmath228 and the linearly evolved wave function @xmath229 where @xmath42 is the initial ( universal ) time . by inserting @xmath18 given by equation in one",
    "obtains that @xmath230    suppose that the initial wave function is @xmath41 , i.e. , that the linearly evolved wave function at time @xmath7 is @xmath231 .",
    "then the right hand side of equation defines the conditional rate for the next flash after time @xmath7 , given the flashes in the past of @xmath7 .",
    "note that this conditional rate thus defines precisely the same flash process as grwf .",
    "in particular , we have that @xmath232 the collapsed wave function @xmath18 provides precisely the same information as the linearly evolving wave function @xmath231 together with all the flashes .",
    "thus , one arrives at the surprising conclusion that the schrdinger wave function can be regarded as governing the evolution of the space - time point process of grwf , so that grwf can indeed be regarded as a _ no - collapse _ theory involving flashes .",
    "we say ` no - collapse ' to underline that the dynamics of the po is then governed by a wave function evolving according to the standard , linear schrdinger equation .",
    "however , while the probability distribution of the future flashes , given the collapsing wave function @xmath18 , does not depend on the past flashes , given only @xmath231 it does .",
    "the two versions of grwf , one using the collapsing wave function @xmath18 and the other using the non  collapsing wave function @xmath231 , should be regarded not as two different theories but rather as two formulations of the same theory , grwf , because they lead to the same distribution of the flashes and thus are physically equivalent .",
    "we conclude from this discussion that what many have considered to be the crucial , irreducible difference between bm and grwf , namely that the wave function collapses in grwf but does not in bm , is not in fact an objective difference at all , but rather a matter of how grwf is presented .",
    "[ sec : markov ]    we close this section with a remark .",
    "a notable difference between the two presentations of grwf is that while the grw collapse process @xmath18 is a markov process , . in more detail , the distribution of the @xmath18 for all @xmath66 conditional on the @xmath18 for all @xmath233",
    "coincides with the distribution of the future conditional on @xmath41 . ]",
    "the point - process @xmath224 of flashes is generically non  markovian . in more detail , we regard a point process in space - time as markovian if for all @xmath234 , @xmath235 where ` future of @xmath236 ' refers to the configuration of points after time @xmath236 , etc .. to see that @xmath224 is non  markovian , note that the distribution of the flashes in the future of @xmath236 depends on what happened between time 0 and time @xmath236 , while the strip in space - time between @xmath237 and @xmath236 may provide little or no useful information , as it may , for small duration @xmath238 , contain no flashes at all .",
    "is generically markovian , but rather by coincidence : given the initial wave function , different patterns of collapse centers between time 0 and time @xmath236 should be expected to lead to different fields @xmath239 , so that the past ( or equivalently @xmath240 ) may be mathematically determined from @xmath239 . ]    for a markovian flash process events in a time interval @xmath241 $ ] are independent of those in a disjoint time interval @xmath242 $ ] , which , as discussed in section [ sec : differences ] , would be rather unreasonable for a model of our world . in passing ,",
    "we note that sf can indeed be regarded as a sort of markovian approximation of ( the linear version of ) grwf for which , at any time , the past is completely ignored in the computation of the conditional probability of future flashes .",
    "in section [ sec : lgrwf ] we showed that grwf can be reformulated in terms of a linearly evolving wave function .",
    "conversely , bm can be reformulated so that it involves a ` collapsed ' wave function . in this formulation",
    "the evolution of the wave function depends on the actual configuration .",
    "the state at time @xmath7 is described by the pair @xmath243 , where @xmath244 is the ( usual ) configuration but @xmath245 is a different wave function than usual , a collapsed wave function . instead of equations and , the state evolves according to @xmath246 which is the same as with @xmath0 replaced by @xmath247 , and @xmath248 which is the same as schrdinger s equation except for the imaginary pseudo - potentials ( @xmath249 m is the same constant as in grw ) @xmath250 making equation nonlinear and @xmath251-dependent .",
    "a solution @xmath252 of equations and can be obtained from a solution @xmath253 of equations and by setting @xmath254 this is readily checked by inserting into equations and .",
    "the ensemble of trajectories with distribution @xmath84 can not be expressed in a simple way in terms of @xmath247 .",
    "nonetheless , for given initial configuration @xmath255 , we obtain from equations and , with given initial @xmath256 , the same trajectory @xmath257 as from equations and with the corresponding @xmath258 .",
    "this may be enough to speak of physical equivalence .",
    "one can read off from that @xmath247 is a _ collapsed _ wave function : whenever @xmath0 is a superposition ( such as for schrdinger s cat ) of macroscopically different states with disjoint supports in configuration space , then in @xmath247 all contributions except the one containing the actual configuration @xmath259 are damped down to near zero .",
    "( still , the evolution is such that when two disjoint packets again overlap , the trajectories display an interference pattern . )    of course , the unitarily - evolving @xmath18 is much more natural than @xmath260 as a mathematical tool for defining the trajectory @xmath261 ; is a simpler equation than .",
    "still , the example shows that we have the choice in bm between using a collapsed wave function @xmath247 or a spread out wave function @xmath0 .",
    "the facts that grwf can be reformulated so that the wave function evolves linearly , in the usual manner according to schrdinger s equation , and that bm can be reformulated in terms of a collapsed wave function indicate that the disagreement between the predictions of the two theories should not be regarded as arising merely from the fact that they involve different wave function evolutions .",
    "it is our contention that the source of the empirical disagreement between bm and grwf can be regarded as lying , neither in their having different evolutions for the wave function , nor in their having different ontologies , but rather in the presence or absence of equivariance with respect to the schrdinger evolution .",
    "more explicitly , we claim that a theory is empirically equivalent to the quantum formalism ( i.e. , that its predictions agree with those of the quantum formalism ) if it yields an equivariant distribution ( defining typicality ) relative to the schrdinger evolution that can be regarded as ` effectively @xmath84 . ' let us explain .",
    "the view we have proposed about the po of a theory and the corresponding role of the wave function has immediate consequences for the criteria for the _ empirical equivalence _ of two theories , i.e. , the statement that they make ( exactly and always ) the same predictions for the outcomes of experiments .    before discussing these consequences ,",
    "let us note a couple of remarkable aspects of the notion of empirical equivalence .",
    "one is that , despite the difficulty of formulating the _ empirical content _ of a theory precisely ( a difficulty mainly owed to the vagueness of the notion ` macroscopic ' ) , one can sometimes establish the empirical equivalence of theories ; for example , that of bm and sm or that of grwm and grwf ; for further examples see @xcite .",
    "another remarkable aspect is that empirical equivalence occurs at all .",
    "one might have expected instead that different theories typically make different predictions , and indeed the theories of classical physics would provide plenty examples .",
    "but in quantum mechanics empirical equivalence is a widespread phenomenon ; see @xcite for discussion of this point .",
    "let us turn to the criteria for empirical equivalence .",
    "since the empirical equivalence of two theories basically amounts to the assertion that the two worlds , governed by the two theories , share the same macroscopic appearance , we have to focus on how to read off the macroscopic appearance of a possible world according to a theory . and",
    "according to our view about po , the macroscopic appearance is a function of the po  but not directly a function of the wave function . in cases",
    "in which one can deduce the macroscopic appearance of a system from its wave function , this is so only by virtue of a law of the theory implying that this wave function is accompanied by a po with a certain macroscopic appearance .",
    "in short , empirical equivalence amounts to a statement about the po .",
    "this view is exemplified by our proof of empirical equivalence between grwm and grwf in section [ sec : empequiv ] . in more detail ,",
    "the position @xmath262 of , say , a pointer at time ( circa ) @xmath7 is a function of the po : in bm and grwm it can be regarded as a function @xmath263 of the configuration , respectively as a function @xmath264 of the @xmath265 field , at time @xmath7 , whereas in grwf it is best regarded as a function of the history of flashes over the past millisecond or so .",
    "concerning the empirical equivalence between a theory and oqt , we need to ask whether the probability of the event @xmath266 agrees with the distribution predicted by standard quantum mechanics .",
    "the latter can be obtained from the schrdinger wave function @xmath18 for a sufficiently big system containing the pointer by integrating @xmath17 over all configurations in which the pointer points to @xmath267 .",
    "thus , regardless of what the po of a theory is , all that is required for the empirical equivalence between the theory and oqt is that it provide the correct @xmath17 probability distributions for the relevant variables @xmath262 . when this is so we may speak of an ` effective @xmath17distribution , ' or of _ macroscopic @xmath84 schrdinger equivariance_. thus , empirical equivalence to oqt amounts to having macroscopic @xmath84 schrdinger equivariance .",
    "( this applies to ` normal ' theories in which pointers point ; the situation is different for theories with a many - worlds character as discussed in section [ subsec : swamw ] . )    grwf ( or grwm ) predicts ( approximately ) the quantum mechanical distribution only under certain circumstances , including , e.g. , that the experimental control over decoherence is limited , and that the universe is young on the timescale of the ` universal warming ' predicted by grwf / grwm ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "moreover , we know that grwf , roughly speaking , makes the same predictions as does the quantum formalism for short times , i.e. , before too many collapses have occurred .",
    "thus , grwf yields an effective @xmath84distribution for times near the initial time @xmath42 .",
    "now , if grwf were ` effectively @xmath84equivariant , ' its predictions would be the same as those of quantum theory for all times .",
    "it is the absence of this macroscopic @xmath84 schrdinger equivariance that renders grwf empirically inequivalent to quantum theory and to bm .",
    "we shall elaborate on this in a future work @xcite .",
    "the most succinct expression of the source of the empirical disagreement between bm and grwf is thus the assertion that bm is effectively @xmath84-equivariant relative to the schrdinger evolution while grwf is not .",
    "the macroscopic schrdinger equivariance of bm follows , of course , from its microscopic @xmath84 schrdinger equivariance , while the lack of macroscopic @xmath84 schrdinger equivariance for grwf follows from the warming associated with the grw evolution and the fact that grwf , as discussed in section [ subsec : poae ] , is microscopically equivariant relative to that evolution .",
    "in fact , it follows from the grw warming that there is , for grwf , no equivariant association @xmath268 with @xmath0 a schrdinger - evolving wave function .",
    "is not appropriate here ; instead , @xmath163 should now be understood to be a probability measure on the space @xmath164 of possible histories of the po for all times , but one whose conditional probabilities for the future of any time given its past are as prescribed , here by the formula ( [ ppp ] ) .",
    "the association is _ equivariant _ if @xmath269 , with @xmath270 now the time translation mapping on @xmath164 . ]",
    "to conclude , we delineate the common structure of grwm , grwf , and bm :    * there is a clear primitive ontology , and it describes matter in space and time .",
    "* there is a state vector @xmath0 in hilbert space that evolves either unitarily or , at least , for microscopic systems very probably for a long time approximately unitarily . *",
    "the state vector @xmath0 governs the behavior of the by means of ( possibly stochastic ) laws . *",
    "the theory provides a notion of a _ typical _ history of the ( of the universe ) , for example by a probability distribution on the space of all possible histories ; from this notion of typicality the probabilistic predictions emerge . * the predicted probability distribution of the macroscopic configuration at time @xmath7 determined by the ( usually ) agrees ( at least approximately ) with that of the quantum formalism .",
    "the features ( i)(v ) are common to these three theories , but they are also desiderata , presumably even necessary conditions , for any satisfactory quantum theory without observers . in hilbert space but by a density matrix @xmath271 on hilbert space , the so - called conditional density matrix . but",
