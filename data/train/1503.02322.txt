    "aharonov and bohm @xcite pointed out that a charged quantum particle may acquire an observable phase shift by circling around a completely shielded magnetic flux .",
    "this remarkable effect is purely non - classical as the electromagnetic field vanishes at the location of the particle , which thereby experiences no lorentz force .",
    "the origin of the phase shift is topological : it only depends on the winding number of the particle s path around the magnetic flux .",
    "the original aharonov - bohm ( ab ) setup for electric charge belongs to a larger class of topological phase effects .",
    "this includes topological phase shifts arising for electrically neutral particles in certain electromagnetic configurations @xcite as well as in general quantum systems that undergo adiabatic evolution @xcite .",
    "a paradigmatic example of the latter is a molecule that acquires an ab phase shift when it reshapes slowly around a conical intersection in nuclear configuration space @xcite .",
    "this adiabatic ab effect is imprinted in the spectral properties related to the pseudorotational molecular motion , and has been observed @xcite in the metallic trimer na@xmath0 .",
    "it has further been predicted @xcite in scattering - type chemical reactions , such as in the hydrogen exchange reaction @xmath1 . due to subtle cancellation effects",
    ", however , direct observation of the ab effect in molecular scattering has been elusive in the past @xcite .",
    "matter waves in spatially varying electromagnetic fields is a tool to engineer a wide range of quantum effects @xcite .",
    "if the variation of these fields is sufficiently slow , the particle motion is governed by adiabatic gauge fields @xcite similar to those in molecules and has been proposed to give rise to ab phase shifts under certain conditions @xcite . here",
    ", we develop an adiabatic ab effect for matter waves that scatter on a static inhomogeneous magnetic field produced by a current - carrying wire .",
    "the setup uses the quantum properties of neutrons to induce the ab effect .",
    "earlier experimental demonstrations of other topological phase effects , such as the aharonov - casher @xcite and scalar ab phase shifts @xcite , as well as related berry phase induced spinor rotations @xcite , have shown that neutrons are suitable to realize ab effects due to their robust internal structure , the ease of detecting them with almost 100 % efficiency , and their weak coupling to the environment .",
    "our setup is similar to the one proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for a nanoelectronic system .",
    "imagine a colimated beam of neutrons that scatter on a long straight wire of radius @xmath2 , carrying an electrical current @xmath3 .",
    "the resulting magnetic field is given by biot - savart s law @xmath4 where we have assumed that the wire points along the @xmath5-axis and carries a uniform current density .",
    "here , @xmath6 is the polar angle in cylindrical coordinates with corresponding basis vector @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the distance from the wire in units of @xmath2 , and @xmath9 is permeability of vacuum .",
    "the magnetic field induces a local energy splitting of the neutron spin states , as described by the zeeman hamiltonian @xmath10 with @xmath11 j / t the neutron magnetic moment and @xmath12 the standard pauli operators representing the neutron spin .",
    "the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian are @xmath13 , which introduce a potential energy barrier ( well ) of height @xmath14 ( depth @xmath15 ) at the surface of the wire .",
    "the hamiltonian relevant for the ab effect is given by the kinetic energy of the neutron in the @xmath16 plane , plus the hamiltonian describing the neutron spin , i.e. , @xmath17 we write the total wave function as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the local spin eigenvectors with @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the two spin eigenstates are associated with the potential energies @xmath23 . here ,",
    "@xmath24 ( dimensionless time ) with @xmath25 kg being the neutron mass .    to determine the spatial wave functions @xmath26 we eliminate the spin degree of freedom by multiplying the schrdinger equation with @xmath27 yielding the coupled equations @xmath28 \\varphi_{\\pm }   ( { \\bf r},s )   \\nonumber",

    ".         the adiabatic regime is characterized by negligible born - huang potential @xmath30 and off - diagonal coupling terms @xmath31 . for low neutron velocities ,",
    "the wire is impenetrable and the validity of the adiabatic approximation can be checked by comparing the size of the scalar potential @xmath32 and @xmath33 at the surface of the wire .",
    "this yields the adiabatic condition @xmath34 . in this regime",
    ", it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : exact ] ) that the spatial wave packets @xmath26 are separately determined by the effective schrdinger equations @xmath35 \\varphi_{\\pm }   ( { \\bf r},s )   \\label{eq : se}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the mead - berry vector potential pointing in the @xmath6 direction .",
    "the shift @xmath37 is the key origin of the ab effect .",
    "it originates from the adiabatic elimination of the spin , which introduces the mead - berry vector potential @xcite @xmath38 in the kinetic energy of the neutron .",
    "this defines the effective magnetic flux @xmath39 picked up by the phase when the neutron moves around the wire along a loop @xmath40 . @xmath41",
    "vanishes if the neutron does not encircle the wire .",
    "the vector potential thus corresponds to an ab flux line carrying half a flux unit ( semi - fluxon ) sitting at the conical intersection point at @xmath42 .",
    "the flux - induced phase is a topological property as it depends neither on the detailed shape of the loop @xmath40 nor on the dynamical parameters of the system , such as the electrical current @xmath3 and the speed of the neutron .",
    "a consequence of the topological nature of the phase shift is that for a non - uniform electrical current density , we can predict that there must be an odd number of points at which the magnetic field vanishes inside the wire as each conical intersection carries half a flux unit @xcite .",
    "we numerically simulate an unpolarized neutron that scatters on the wire .",
    "we solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : se ] ) for the two adiabatic channels and calculate the density profile @xmath43 obtained by tracing over the spin .",
    "we choose @xmath44 ma and @xmath45 m , which yields @xmath46 .",
    "the spatial degree of freedom of the neutron is modeled as an incoming gaussian wave packet of @xmath47 @xmath48 m width , whose centre is moving in the @xmath16 plane straight on to the wire at relative velocity @xmath49 .",
    "the wire is assumed to be made of an electrically conducting material with a positive neutron optical potential that can reflect slow neutrons .",
    "an appropriate choice would be copper with a positive optical potential corresponding to a critical neutron velocity of about 5.7 m / s .",
    "we assume neutron velocities @xmath49 well below this critical value , which means that we can take @xmath26 to vanish at @xmath50 . with the chosen @xmath51",
    ", we expect the adiabatic treatment to be valid , which has indeed been confirmed numerically to a high degree of accuracy by comparing the wave packet dynamics arising from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : se ] ) and ( [ eq : exact ] )",
    ".    the summation - by - parts  simultaneous approximation term ( sbp - sat ) method @xcite is a time - stable well - proven high - order difference methodology suitable for solving wave - dominated phenomena @xcite . in the present study",
    "a sixth - order accurate sbp - sat approximation has been employed , solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : se ] ) with high fidelity .         to study the adiabatic ab effect we first compare the dynamics with @xmath52 m / s for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where the latter case corresponds to ignoring the adiabatic flux .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( see also supplementary movies 1 and 2 ) , the effective ab flux introduces a nodal line in the forward direction , which is not visible when @xmath54 .",
    "this is the key signature of the adiabatic ab effect related to the effective flux line carrying half a flux unit associated with destructive interference in the forward direction @xcite",
    ". it would be directly detectable by measuring the neutron density profile in the @xmath16 plane behind the wire .",
    "we further perform simulations at @xmath55 and @xmath56 m / s , shown in fig . [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the nodal line persists , which demonstrates the nondispersive nature of the ab effect and opens up for the possibility to perform the test even if we allow for a distribution of incoming velocities within the adiabatic regime .",
    "a significant simplification of the experimental setting is that unpolarized neutrons can be used , due to the spatial bifurcation caused by the energy splitting of the two local spin eigenstates .",
    "we demonstrate this effect in terms of the local spin density @xmath57 the scalar part @xmath58 is shown fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( see also supplementary movie 3 ) .",
    "we note that only @xmath59 contributes significantly to the ab phase shift ; the reason being the attractive nature of the adiabatic potential @xmath60 associated with this state for @xmath61 .    the low neutron velocities can be experimentally achieved by letting the neutron hit the wire at small angle .",
    "this can be realized for cold neutrons ( speed a few 100 m / s ) initially moving parallel to a horizontal wire .",
    "the bending of the neutron beam in the gravitational field induces a small velocity component @xmath49 towards the wire . for fixed incoming speed , the relative velocity @xmath49",
    "can be controlled either by moving the wire in the vertical direction or by tilting it slightly upwards in the direction of motion .    the incoming wave packet used in the numerical simulations",
    "have been chosen to clearly demonstrate the adiabatic ab effect on the spatial distribution of the scattered neutrons . however , to reproduce this wave packet dynamics in an actual experiment would be challenging as it would require a very high angular resolution and precise centering of the neutron beam .",
    "the difficulty is associated with the small size of the wave packet that would decrease the number of neutrons that would hit the wire in the desired manner .",
    "a less demanding setting would require the transversal width of the wave packet to be much larger than the width of the wire as this would allow for higher neutron flux .",
    "the ab - induced destructive interference effect in the forward direction would be intact for such a wave packet , as the ab effect is topological and therefore independent of shape and size of the neutron wave function .",
    "we have demonstrated an adiabatic ab effect for slow neutrons that scatter on a magnetic field produced by an electrical current through a very long wire .",
    "the mechanism of the effect is the berry phase of the neutron spin restricted to the plane perpendicular to the wire .",
    "therefore , the acquired phase shift is restricted to @xmath62 , known to be the only possible non - trivial value of a planar spin .",
    "the @xmath62 phase shift causes destructive intereference in the forward direction , providing an unambigous signature of the adiabatic ab effect in a scattering setup .",
    "we have further demonstrated the nondispersive nature of the effect , which opens up for the possibility to observe the effect for higher neutron velocities in the adiabatic regime .",
