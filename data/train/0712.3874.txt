    "the temperature and pressure at the base of the accreted layer slowly increase until the nuclear energy generation rate of the @xmath6-reaction becomes more sensitive to temperature perturbations than the radiative cooling . at this point",

    "although the basic physics of type i x - ray bursts is understood , detailed comparisons between observations and theoretical models have had mixed success ( e.g. , woosley et al .",
    "the most successful comparison has been with the `` clocked burster ''",

    "studies of the bursts from gs 1826238 began during the _ bepposax _ mission , with the most detailed study of burst recurrence times and energetics coming from @xcite , who analyzed 24 bursts from the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( @xmath8 ) detected between 1997 november and 2002 july .",
    "they found that the recurrence time decreased from @xmath9  hr to @xmath10  hr while the persistent ( between burst ) flux level increased by 66% , so that the recurrence time decreased almost precisely as @xmath11 . assuming @xmath12 implies that the accumulated mass required for the instability to occur is approximately the same even as the accretion rate changes .",
    "the long burst durations ( @xmath13100 s ) and the low value of @xmath14 ( @xmath140 )  the ratio of the integrated bolometric persistent flux between bursts to the total bolometric burst fluence  both suggest that hydrogen constitutes a large portion of the fuel for these bursts @xcite .",
    "further support for the h - rich fuel scenario comes from comparisons of the observed light curves with those predicted by time - dependent models , which also imply solar h and cno composition in the material accreted by gs 1826@xmath0238(heger et al .",

    "additional @xmath8  observations have been made as part of a monitoring campaign from 2003 through 2007 .",
    "these data reveal that the previously monotonic relation between burst recurrence time and persistent x - ray flux no longer fully describes the source behavior . here",
    "we present an analysis of the full data set with the objective of more fully characterizing the complex burst behavior .",
    "we have also analyzed observations from the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ in 2002 july , and _ xmm - newton _ in 2003 april , both of which occurred simultaneously with @xmath8 , in order to also study the low - energy spectrum .",
    "in addition , we used optical observations made with the uct - ccd fast photometer at the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) in 1998 june to determine the bursting behavior during gaps in the @xmath8  observations . in   2 we describe these observations and the details of our data analysis .",

    "measurements of the burst recurrence times were made using pca event mode data with 1 s bins , including all photon energies .",
    "the times of the bursts were defined to be when the flux exceeds 25% of the peak flux of each of the bursts . sometimes bursts took place when the satellite was not taking any data ( e.g. , during passages through the south atlantic anomaly ) , and recurrence times were inferred if bursts occurred near enough together to unambiguously know the number of intervening bursts .",
    "this method is acceptable because bursts from gs 1826@xmath0238  have _ never _ been observed to occur at irregular intervals .",
    "if the time between two observed bursts is @xmath16 , the recurrence time is estimated as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 bursts are inferred in data gaps . following galloway et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we adopted a fractional error of 2% on the individual recurrence time measurements , and when bursts are inferred the error is scaled by @xmath19 because we assume @xmath20 burst intervals in total .",

    "as with the energy spectra and colors , we excluded data 500 s before to 1500 s after each burst .",

    "it is conventionally assumed that the accretion rate in lmxbs is proportional to the x - ray flux , and since we measure the flux in an instrumentally - determined passband , there is always the possibility that spectral variations outside our passband will cause the proportionality to change between observation epochs .",

    "@xcite pointed out that because the instability leading to bursts is a local phenomenon , the time for instability to develop depends on the accretion rate per unit area rather than the global accretion rate . a faster ignition time in 2003",
    "april could thus be explained by accretion over a more limited area of the surface of the neutron star relative to the other observing epochs .",
    "even if the instability begins sooner , we expect the burst will consume all of the fuel that has been accreted since the previous burst because , although the instability leading to the burst is a local phenomenon , the subsequent spreading burning front encompasses the entire stellar surface @xcite . in this case , we would expect the burst fluences to be reduced approximately to the ratio of the recurrence times , i.e. , @xmath133/4 , assuming no change in the fuel composition at ignition , and a similar accretion rate in 2003 april as for the observations at similar persistent flux levels .",
    "instead , the fluences for the 2003 april are roughly similar to the bursts at higher or lower accretion rates ( fig .",

    "one way the burst fluences in 2003 april could still match the measured values for the other bursts despite @xmath1325% less fuel is a change in the composition of the fuel .",

    "a h - fraction that is @xmath135% greater at ignition for the 2003 april bursts could thus compensate for the smaller accreted mass .",
    "naturally , the mean h - fraction will be higher for bursts with shorter recurrence times , since less time has passed for steady h - burning to reduce the accreted composition . the time to burn all the accreted hydrogen is @xmath72  hr ( e.g. , cumming & bildsten 2000 ) , where @xmath73 is the cno mass fraction , and @xmath74 the accreted composition . assuming the accreted hydrogen begins burning immediately upon being accreted",

    "the only real indication of a significant difference between the light curves is in the second decay constant ( @xmath80 ) , which is somewhat longer for 2003 april than in 2000",
    "june / september . however , these parameters do systematically depend on the recurrence time due to the changing hydrogen fraction ( see fig . 4 from heger et al . 2008 )",

    "although this is a more inhomogeneous sample compared to 2003 april and 2000 june / september , @xmath80 for 2003 april is consistent with the others , though slightly higher ( but not significantly ) in the mean .",
    "there is a slightly longer second decay constant and lower peak flux for the 2003 april bursts compared to the bursts at the next nearest flux determined by _ rxte _ , but , similar to the comparison of @xmath80 , it is consistent with the bursts at the nearest recurrence time .",
    "during 2003 april , the recurrence times of thermonuclear bursts from gs 1826@xmath0238  were unexpectedly short given the persistent flux measured by _",
    "rxte _ and the previously - determined monotonic relation between these two parameters . at the same time",
    ", the spectrum from a simultaneous _ xmm - newton _ observation (   [ bbs ] ) suggests that an additional soft thermal component may be present at this time , which could increase the unabsorbed bolometric flux by up to 50% .",
    "a significant piece of evidence supporting a redistribution of the accretion energy within the x - ray bands is the accompanying shift of the variability to faster timescales ( fig .",
    "[ psdcorr ] ) , because correlations between higher power spectral frequencies and softer energy spectra are observed almost ubiquitously in black hole candidates and in many neutron stars . a direct relationship between qpo frequency and power - law index has been seen in many black hole candidates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in at least five neutron stars ( e.g. , titarchuk & shaposhnikov 2005 ) .",
    "moreover , episodes of rare soft thermal components ( interpreted as the accretion disk ) lasting for several months in the black hole candidate grs 1758258 seem to be triggered by a decrease in the hard emission @xcite . perhaps the most relevant example is from @xcite , however , who showed that there is a direct correlation between the flux of the blackbody component and the qpo frequency in the burster 4u 0614 + 091 .",
    "although high frequency qpos are not observed in the gs 1826@xmath0238  power spectra , the correlations between the frequencies of qpos and broadband noise components in other sources make it tempting to speculate that the higher psd frequencies in 2003 april are indeed coupled with a soft spectral component , the presence of which is presumably related to changes in the accretion geometry .",
    "the correlations between faster variability and soft spectral components can be understood in the context of truncated disk models for accretion in x - ray binaries , which explain the low / hard to high / soft spectral transitions seen in both black hole and neutron star systems ( for a recent review , see done et al .",
    "2008 ) . for neutron star binaries at low @xmath82 ( @xmath130.040.08 in gs 1826@xmath0238 , assuming @xmath83 kpc ) ,",
    "such models consist of a thin accretion disk that is truncated at some radius far from the surface , probably due to evaporation of the accretion disk @xcite , and an optically thin but geometrically thick hot inner flow that smoothly transitions to the boundary layer .",
    "seed photons from the surface of the star and from the inner edge of the disk cool the inner flow . at higher accretion rates , the inner radius of the disk moves inwards , which reduces the volume of the region occupied by the hot inner flow . assuming that most of the variability comes from this region ,",
    "then a smaller volume would naturally account for the faster variability .",
    "in addition , the smaller disk radius will lead to a more prominent soft spectral component .",
    "one could argue that the soft photon flux should be present all the time , and perhaps just not detectable in the other observations due to poorer low - energy coverage . according to truncated disk models ,",
    "however , at low accretion rates the accretion disk is expected to be far from the surface of the neutron star ( e.g. , esin et al .",
    "if we assume that the power spectral break frequency @xmath65 is associated with the inner disk radius and the orbital frequencies are keplerian ( @xmath84 ) , we expect the inner disk radius in 2002 july , for example , to be @xmath13 times larger than in 2003 april , and the integrated disk flux to be @xmath13 times smaller ( frank et al .",
    "1992 , p.73 ) .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the ratio of the absorbed soft fluxes shown in fig .",
    "[ models ] .    given that the 2003 april power spectral frequencies are the highest , and at the same time",
    "the burst recurrence time suggests the accretion rate is the highest , it is worth considering that an alternative indicator for the mass accretion rate may be the timing data rather than the x - ray flux .",
    "for example , it has been proposed that @xmath65 is positively correlated with the mass accretion rate ( e.g. , van der klis 1994 ) . if this were the case , however , we would expect a monotonic relationship between @xmath65 and burst recurrence time ( which we also assume to trace mass accretion rate ) .",
    "such a relationship does not exist . to see this",
    ", one must only consider the data from 1998 june ( optical ) ; the break frequency is the second highest value even though the inferred accretion rate is the third lowest ( only 1997 november and 1998 june have longer burst recurrence times , fig .",
    "[ fluxdt ] ) . on the other hand , the two observing epochs showing the largest disparity between the recurrence time flux and the observed flux ( fig .",
    "[ resid ] ) , i.e. , 1998 june ( optical ) and 2003 april , also exhibit the highest break frequencies .",
    "therefore , it may be the case that @xmath65 is a better tracer of the soft thermal flux and not the bolometric flux , although the absence of low - energy spectral coverage in the majority of gs 1826@xmath0238  observing epochs precludes a detailed comparison .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the bursts are igniting earlier , perhaps because the area over which the accretion occurs has decreased ; however , any plausible mechanism to ignite the bursts earlier would also give rise to bursts that were significantly less energetic than others at comparable x - ray fluxes , whereas we find bursts in 2003 april with fluences comparable to those in other epochs .",
    "thus , we conclude that the x - ray flux measured by _ rxte _ in 2003",
    "april underestimates the bolometric flux to a much greater degree than in other epochs , likely due to the presence of enhanced x - ray emission below @xmath132 kev .",
    "this implies that although the x - ray flux measured by _ rxte _ in 2003 april was similar to what was observed in 2000",
    "june / september , the accretion rate ( and `` true '' bolometric flux ) in 2003 april must have been at its highest level because the recurrence time was the smallest .",
    "this idea is consistent with truncated disk models , which explain the emergence of the soft spectral component by a reduction of the inner disk radius at high accretion rates . in this scenario",
    ", the previous and subsequent _ rxte _ observations of gs 1826@xmath0238  fortuitously maintained a fairly strict correspondence between x - ray flux in the _ rxte _ passband and accretion rate due to a relatively constant spectral shape .",
    "our results indicate that the spectral shape in gs 1826@xmath0238  starts to undergo a significant transformation when the bolometric flux is above about @xmath85 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 , or when the luminosity is above @xmath86 erg s@xmath5 @xmath87 .",
    "there are other factors that could play a role during the periods of discrepant bursting behavior .",
    "one possibility is that the photon emission from gs 1826@xmath0238  may be anisotropic .",
    "such emission is expected any time the scattering optical depth is much lower over a limited range of solid angles than in other directions @xcite , and includes any source with an accretion disk .",
    "recent work by heger et al .",
    "( 2008 ) suggests that emission anisotropy does indeed influence the observational characteristics of gs 1826@xmath0238 . in order for the burst timing and energetics from _ rxte _ observations between 1997 november to 2002 july to match theoretical ignition models",
    ", they found that @xmath88 .",
    "different anisotropy factors for the burst and persistent emission are expected because the radiation can be attributed to geometrically distinct regions @xcite .",
