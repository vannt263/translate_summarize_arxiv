    "heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) or , more generally , the expansion in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass @xmath0 , has become a generally accepted and widely used tool in heavy quark physics@xcite . based on the infinite mass limit @xmath1 of qcd it provides a model independent starting point for the description of weak transitions involving heavy quarks .    the idea to exploit the fact that the mass of a heavy quark is large compared to the typical scale @xmath2 of the light qcd degrees of freedom ( e.g.  the constituent mass of a light quark or the scale of the qcd coupling constant @xmath3 ) is in fact quite old@xcite .",
    "however , in the late eighties a breakthrough was achieved by mainly two observations .",
    "first , in the infinite mass limit qcd exhibits an additional flavour symmetry and a spin symmetry@xcite , the group theory of which allow model independent statements concerning weak decays of heavy hadrons .",
    "second , it was noted that the @xmath4 expansion of qcd can be formulated as an effective field theory @xcite , which allows to access the corrections to the infinite mass limit in a systematic way .",
    "since then the field of heavy quark physics has attracted a lot of attention , documented by an enormous number of papers that have been published using these methods .",
    "in addition , from the experimental side a large effort is made to investigate the decays of bottom hadrons in order to pin down the origin of quark mixing and cp violation . in the standard model ( sm )",
    "all of this is encoded in the ckm matrix , and the measurement of those elements of this matrix , which are only poorly known , involves mainly weak processes of @xmath5 quarks .",
    "hqet , or more generally the systematic application of the @xmath4 expansion in qcd , has brought some progress in the determination of these ckm matrix elements , since heavy quark symmetries allow a drastic reduction of the hadronic uncertainties which enter the game through our ignorance to deal with the qcd bound state problem from first principles . in particular , the @xmath6 semileptonic decay may considered as a heavy @xmath7 heavy transition , where heavy quark symmetries work very efficiently ; consequently , the @xmath4 expansion allows for an almost model independent determination of the ckm matrix element @xmath8 .    in the next section a brief summary on hqet and heavy quark symmetries",
    "section 3 deals with the `` picture book application '' , namely the exclusive @xmath9 semileptonic decays .",
    "heavy quark symmetries are also of some use in the case of a heavy hadron decaying into something light , and in section 4 this is considered for the case of heavy to light transitions .",
    "finally a summary and a few conclusions are given .",
    "hqet is an effective field theory which may be obtained from qcd by performing a @xmath4 expansion .",
    "the leading term corresponds to the infinite mass limit in which the heavy quark acts as a static color source .",
    "the momentum @xmath10 of the heavy quark scales with its mass and in order to perform the infinite mass limit it is convenient to use the velocity @xmath11 of the heavy quark as the basic kinematic quantity . to this",
    "end the heavy quark momentum is split into a large part @xmath12 and a residual part @xmath13 , which is assumed not to scale with the heavy mass . thus @xmath14 we shall consider exclusively hadrons containing only a single heavy quark such that in the infinite mass limit the velocity @xmath11 of the heavy quark becomes simply the velocity of the heavy hadron .    in order to write down a field theory which describes the static heavy quark",
    "one may go through the usual steps of the construction of an effective field theory , namely to integrate out the heavy degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "an alternative method @xcite is to perform a foldy wouthuysen transformation as it is used in the standard non - relativistic reduction of the dirac equation .",
    "although the @xmath4 expansion of the lagrangian and the corresponding expansion of the fields look completely different , the results for physical matrix elements will be the same since the @xmath4 expansion of the qcd greens functions constructed from this effective theory has to be unique .    in the notation of @xcite one obtains @xmath15 h_v \\\\        & = & e^{-im_qvx } \\left [ 1 + \\frac{1}{2m_q }",

    "one would write a static lagrangian for both quarks @xmath21 where @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) is the field operator for the @xmath5 ( @xmath24 ) quark moving with velocity @xmath11 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "in particular , the masses of the heavy quarks do not appear in the lagrangian ( [ lbc ] ) , and as a consequence ( [ lbc ] ) in the case @xmath26 exhibits an @xmath27 heavy flavour symmetry which rotates the @xmath22 field into the @xmath28 field .    the static heavy quark field @xmath18 is still a two component object corresponding to the upper component of the full heavy quark field @xmath29 .",
    "however , both spin directions couple in the same way to the gluons ; we may rewrite the leading - order lagrangian as @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the projections of the heavy quark field on a definite spin direction @xmath32 @xmath33 this lagrangian has a symmetry under the rotations of the heavy quark spin and hence all the heavy hadron states moving with the velocity @xmath11 fall into spin - symmetry doublets as @xmath1 . the simplest spin - symmetry doublet in the mesonic case",
    "consists of the pseudoscalar meson @xmath34 and the corresponding vector meson @xmath35 , since a @xmath36-spin rotation @xmath37 around the rotation axis @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) yields @xmath40    in the heavy - mass limit the spin symmetry partners have to be degenerate and their splitting has to scale as @xmath4 .",
    "in other words , the quantity @xmath41 has to be the same for all spin symmetry doublets of heavy ground state mesons .",
    "this is well supported by data : for both the @xmath42 and the @xmath43 doublets one finds a value of @xmath44 gev@xmath45 .",
    "this shows that the spin - symmetry partners become degenerate in the infinite mass limit and the splitting between them scales as @xmath4 .    in the infinite mass limit",
    "the symmetries imply relations between matrix elements involving heavy quarks .",
    "for a transition between heavy ground - state mesons @xmath46 ( either pseudoscalar or vector ) with heavy flavour @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) moving with velocities @xmath11 ( @xmath25 ) , one obtains in the heavy - quark limit @xmath49 where @xmath50 is some arbitrary dirac matrix and @xmath34 are the representation matrices for the two possibilities of coupling the heavy quark spin to the spin of the light degrees of freedom , which are in a spin-1/2 state for ground state mesons",
    "@xmath51 due to the spin and flavour independence of the heavy mass limit the isgur  wise function @xmath52 is the only non - perturbative information needed to describe all heavy to heavy transitions within a spin - flavour symmetry multiplet .",
    "similar statements may be derived for the spin symmetry doublets of excited heavy mesons@xcite and also for baryons@xcite .",
    "corrections to the infinite mass limit may be considered in a systematic way .",
    "they fall into two classes : the recoil or @xmath4 corrections and the qcd radiative corrections .    in order to discuss the corrections we shall consider a specific example , namely the matrix element of a current @xmath53 mediating a transition between a heavy meson and some arbitrary state @xmath54 . using the expansions ( [ harvlag ] ) and ( [ harvfield ] ) one obtains up to order @xmath4 @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the first - order corrections to the lagrangian as given in ( [ harvlag ] ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath57 is the state of the heavy meson in full qcd , including all its mass dependence , while @xmath58 is the corresponding state in the infinite mass limit .    expression ( [ exp ] ) displays the generic structure of the higher - order corrections as they appear in any hqet calculation .",
    "there will be local contributions coming from the expansion of the full qcd field ; these may be interpreted as the corrections to the currents .",
    "the non - local contributions , i.e.  the time - ordered products , are the corresponding corrections to the states and thus in the r.h.s .  of ( [ exp ] ) only the states of the infinite - mass limit appear .",
    "although the @xmath4 corrections need in general additional input beyond hqet , there is one important result on the corrections linear in @xmath4 , which is called luke s theorem@xcite and which is the application of the ademollo gatto theorem@xcite to the case of heavy flavour symmetry . in its general form",
    "the theorem states that in the presence of explicit symmetry breaking the matrix elements of the symmetry generating currents , which are normalized due to the symmetry , do not receive corrections linear in the symmetry breaking .",
    "applied to the case at hand this means that some of the form factors in weak decays , namely the ones proportional to the isgur wise function , receive only corrections quadratic in @xmath4 .",
    "this result has important phenomenological consequences , which we shall discuss below .",
    "all the relations given up to now are tree level relations .",
    "going beyond tree level will induce qcd radiative corrections of order @xmath59 , @xmath60 . as in any field theory these corrections are perturbatively calculable in terms of feynman diagramms .",
    "the effective theory has two additional feynman rules ( the propagator of the heavy quark and the coupling of the heavy quark to the gluons ) which may be read off from the static lagrangian ( [ lstat ] ) .    for the sake of clarity we shall stick to our example of a heavy light current considered above . to leading order in the @xmath4 expansion one may evaluate the radiative corrections to such a matrix element using the above feynman rules and finds a divergent result with a divergence related to the short distance behavior . since hqet is an effective theory , the machinery of effective theory guarantees the factorization of long distance effects from the short distance ones , which are related to the large mass @xmath0 . neglecting @xmath4 corrections",
    ", this factorization takes the form @xmath61 from feynman rule calculation one obtains the perturbative expansion of the renormalization constant @xmath62 which generically looks like @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "this factorization theorem corresponds to the statement that the ultraviolet divergencies in the effective theory have to match the logarithmic mass dependences of full qcd .",
    "the factorization scale @xmath65 is an arbitrary parameter , and the physical quantity @xmath66 does not depend on this parameter .",
    "however , calculating the matrix element of this operator in the effective theory and studying its ultraviolet behavior allows us to access the mass dependence of the matrix element @xmath66 .",
    "the ultraviolet behavior of the effective theory is investigated by the renormalization group equation ( rge ) , which is obtained in the usual way from differentiating ( [ expr ] ) with respect to the factorization scale @xmath65 .",
    "the rge for the short distance coefficient @xmath62 becomes @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the anomalous dimension of the current @xmath69 which is related to the ultraviolet behavior of the matrix elements of @xmath69 .",
    "the function @xmath70 defines the running of the coupling constant @xmath71 both functions @xmath68 and @xmath70 are calculable in perturbation theory using a loopwise expansion , where the first term of the @xmath72 function of qcd is well known @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the number of flavors with a mass less than @xmath0 .    with this input",
    "the renormalization group equation may be solved to yield @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the first coefficient in the perturbative expansion of the anomalous dimension @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the one loop expression for the running coupling constant of qcd @xmath79 which is obtained from solving ( [ gml ] ) using ( [ beta0 ] ) .",
    "this expression corresponds to a summation of the leading logarithms @xmath80 which is achieved by a one - loop calculation of the renormalization group functions @xmath72 and @xmath81 ; in other words , in this way a resummation of the first column of the expansion ( [ zexp ] ) is achieved .    in a similar way one may also resum the second column of ( [ zexp ] ) ,",
    "if the renormalization group functions @xmath72 and @xmath82 are calculated to two loops and the non - logarithmic terms of the one loop expression are included .",
    "eq.([rge ] ) describes the renormalization group scaling in the effective theory .",
    "it allows to shift logarithms of the large mass scale from the matrix element of @xmath69 into the coefficient @xmath62 : if the matrix element is renormalized at the large scale @xmath0 the logarithms of the type @xmath83 will apear in the matrix element of @xmath69 while the coefficient @xmath62 at this scale will simply be @xmath84 the renormalization group equation ( [ rge ] ) allows to lower the renormalization point from @xmath0 to @xmath65 ; the matrix element renormalized at @xmath65 will not contain any logarithms of @xmath0 any more , they will appear in the coefficient @xmath62 in the way shown in ( [ zexp ] ) .    in all cases relevant in the present context",
    "the matrix elements will be matrix elements involving hadronic states , which are in most cases impossible to calculate from first principles .",
    "however , eq.([rge ] ) allows to extract the short distance piece , i.e.  the logarithms of the large mass @xmath0 and to separate it into the wilson coefficients .",
    "finally , the case we have considered as an example is indeed very simple ; in general all operators of a given dimension may mix under renormalization , i.e. instead of a simple anomalous dimension a matrix of anomalous dimensions may occur and the renormalization group equation [ rge ] becomes a system of differential equations .",
    "in this section we shall discuss the transitions of the heavy to heavy type , i.e. the @xmath6 decays .",
    "the implications of heavy quark symmetry have been given already in the form of the wigner eckart theorem ( [ wet ] ) in the last section , so we shall focus here on the status of the corrections to the infinite mass limit and give the phenomenological applications of the results .",
    "the matrix elements relevant for the processes under consideration are @xmath86 where the point @xmath26 is of particular interest , since the absolute normalization of the matrix elements is known at this point due to heavy quark symmetries .    in order to evaluate the qcd radiative corrections to these matrix elements we shall make use of the renormalization group ( rg ) machinery as outlined in the last section . at a large scale @xmath87",
    "both currents are conserved in the limit of vanishing @xmath5 and @xmath24 quark masses and hence their anomalous dimension vanishes .",
    "running down from @xmath88 to @xmath89 , i.e. lowering the renormalization scale of the matrix elements ( [ currents ] ) from @xmath88 to @xmath89 induces no large logarithms of the form @xmath90 , rather the corrections will be small , of the order @xmath91 .    similarly , at scales @xmath65 below the charm",
    "quark mass @xmath92 both quarks may be taken to be infinitely heavy , and at the non - recoil point @xmath26 again the two currents are conserved and thus their anomalous dimension vanishes . running below the charm quark mass will thus induce only small corrections of the order @xmath93 .",
    "thus the main corrections originate from scales @xmath65 between @xmath89 and @xmath92 . in the effective theory where the @xmath5 is taken to be infinitely heavy and the @xmath24 is still light the one@xcite and two loop@xcite anomalous dimensions",
    "have been calculated and allow a resummation of terms of order @xmath94 , and @xmath95 respectively .",
    "furthermore , in this theory the subleading terms of order @xmath96 @xcite and @xmath97 @xcite have been considered at the one loop level , and the matching at the scale @xmath92 yields a resummation of terms of order @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the procedure described here has the disadvantage that numerically it is useful only in the limit @xmath100 such that @xmath101 is a large logarithm and terms of order @xmath102 may be neglected . in real life",
    "we have @xmath103 and one may think of simply performing the one loop calculation including the masses in full qcd and use this to match directly qcd to a theory with two static quarks , where heavy quark symmetries hold . in this way one obtains all terms of order @xmath104 . however , the price to pay is a scale ambiguity in the scale of @xmath105 which has to be taken at some scale @xmath106 between @xmath89 and @xmath92 .",
    "numerically this is not a problem since @xmath105 does not run much between @xmath92 and @xmath89 .",
    "recently the latter procedure has ben applied at the two loop level @xcite such that the terms of order @xmath107 are now known .",
    "the usual way to parametrize the corrections is by introducing corrections factors @xmath108 which are known up to terms of order @xmath109 . taking the numbers of @xcite one",
    "has @xmath110 the uncertainty given here is the uncertainty due to the terms of order @xmath109 and is conservatively estimated by the size of the calculated @xmath111 corrections .",
    "given the fact that the calculated qcd corrections are already below the level of @xmath112 one needs to worry also about qed corrections .",
    "in fact , the qed corrections to processes of this type have been calculated already some time ago in the context of @xmath65 decay@xcite .",
    "similar to the qcd corrections they may be factorized and in principle one could apply also renormalization group methods .",
    "however , the running of the qed coupling is negligible at this level and the qed corrections factor is given by @xmath113              \\sim 1.013 \\,\\",
    ", \\eta_{a / v}\\ ] ] hence short distance qed corrections enhance the matrix elements by @xmath114 .",
    "in general the recoil corrections are more complicated , since they may not be calculated from the effective theory , rather they can only be parametrized in terms of new matrix elements .",
    "the calculation of these matrix elements in any case needs additional input ( such as models or a lattice calculation ) beyond the framework of hqet .    however , in some cases luke s theorem applies . in particular ,",
    "the axial vector current taken at the non - recoil point @xmath26 is protected by this theorem , such that @xmath115 among the first non - trivial corrections the ones of the order @xmath116 will be the most important , and hqet allows only to parametrize them in terms of new matrix elements .",

    "furthermore , the parameters @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the kinetic energy and the chromomagnetic moment of the heavy quark .",
    "they also appear in the @xmath4 expansion of the heavy meson mass @xmath121 where @xmath122 for the @xmath123 and @xmath124 for the @xmath125 meson , and may be related to the matrix elements @xmath126 the only parameter which is easy to access is @xmath120 , since it is related to the mass splitting between @xmath34 and @xmath127 . from the @xmath128-meson system",
    "we obtain @xmath129 and from the charm system ( including the renormalization group scaling of @xmath119 ) the same value is obtained .",
    "this shows that indeed the spin - symmetry partners are degenerate in the infinite mass limit and the splitting between them scales as @xmath4 .",
    "the other parameters appearing in ( [ massrel ] ) are not simply related to the hadron spectrum .",
    "furthermore , they exhibit renormalon ambiguities , which imply that a proper prescription has to be given how to extract these quantities from data using renormalized perturbation theory .",
    "recently there has been such an attempt @xcite , namley to extract @xmath130 and @xmath119 from the shape of the lepton energy spectrum in inclusive semileptonic @xmath128 decays .",
    "the values obtained from this analysis are @xmath131 gev and @xmath132 gev@xmath45 , where the @xmath133 definition of the mass has been used .",
    "the uncertainties quoted are only the @xmath134 statistical ones ; the systematical uncertainties of this approach are difficult to estimate .",
    "these considerations only fix the local matrix elements in ( [ oom2 ] ) , while the nonlocal terms involving the time - ordered products are much harder to estimate .",
    "the estimates found in the literature have to rely on some model estimates and span a range which implies roughly a @xmath135 theoretical uncertainty .",
    "a commonly accepted number was given in @xcite @xmath136        in the last few years a lot of data has been accumulated which may be used to test heavy quark symmetry and to extract ckm matrix elements with the use of hqet .",

    "in particular the ratios @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) measures the ratio of the differential transverse ( longitudinal ) rate and the total differential rate . in the heavy mass limit",

    "@xmath150      from the measured lepton invariant mass spectrum one may determine @xmath8 in a model independent way by extrapolating to the kinematical endpoint of maximal momentum transfer to the leptons , corresponding to the point @xmath26 .",

    "hence we have @xmath153 including qed corrections and the estimate of the @xmath154 corrections in the way discussed in section 2 one obtains @xmath155 from this value one may extract from the extrapolations shown in figs.1 and 2 a value for @xmath8 @xmath156 where the last error reflects the theoretical uncertainty of the @xmath4 corrections .",
    "recently cleo has also measured the leptonic invariant mass spectrum for the decay @xmath137 . in a similar way one may perform an extrapolation to obtain @xmath8 . here",
    "one gets from ( [ bd ] ) @xmath157 in this case a form factor enters which is not protected by lukes theorem , @xmath158 .",
    "however , this does not spoil the possibility to determine @xmath159 from this mode , since the @xmath4 corrections are kinematically suppressed by the factor @xmath160 .",

    "these corrections have been estimated recently @xcite @xmath164 the data from cleocleovcb1 are shown in fig.3 . from the extrapolation shown in fig.[fig2 ] one obtain the value @xmath165 where the last error again reflects the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "both values of @xmath8 are in very good agreement and are also consistent with values obtained form other methods , in particular with the results from inclusive semileptonic decays@xcite .",
    "the data on the leptonic invariant mass spectrum extend over the whole rage of @xmath166 and the extrapolation to @xmath167 has to rely on some ansatz for the isgur wise function .",
    "this may be used in turn to extract a value also for the slope of the isgur wise function .",
    "close to the point @xmath168 one thus parametrizes the isgur wise function as @xmath169 the theoretical predictions@xcite for the slope parameter @xmath170 depend on matrix elements involving excited @xmath16 mesons which are hard to estimate ; thus the theoretical value is quite uncertain and ranges between @xmath171 data on the slope parameter come from the lep experiments as well as from argus and cleo , the results obtained from experiment are @xmath172 which are compatible with the theoretical expectation .",
    "heavy quark symmetries may also be used to restrict the independent form factors appearing in heavy to light decays . for the decays of heavy mesons into light @xmath123 and @xmath125 particles",
    "heavy quark symmetries restrict the number of independent form factors to six , which is just the number needed to parametrize the semileptonic decays of this type .",
    "furthermore , no absolute normalization of form factors may be obtained from heavy quark symmetries in the heavy to light case ; only the relative normalization of @xmath128 meson decays heavy to light transitions may be obtained from the corresponding @xmath16 decays .    in general",

    "the first example is the heavy meson decay constant , where the state @xmath178 is simply the vacuum state .",
    "the heavy meson decay constant is defined by @xmath182 and since @xmath183 the matrix @xmath184 is simply the unit matrix times a dimensionful constant may be eliminated using @xmath185 ] and one has , using ( [ htltrg ] ) @xmath186 as discussed above the constant @xmath187 does not depend on the heavy mass and thus one infers the well - known scaling law for the heavy meson decay constant from the last two equations @xmath188 including the leading and subleading qcd radiative corrections one obtains a relation between @xmath189 and @xmath190 @xmath191 f_d \\sim 0.69 f_d .\\ ] ]    the second example are transitions of a heavy meson into a light pseudoscalar meson , which we shall denote as @xmath192 .",
    "the matrix element corresponding to ( [ htlg ] ) is @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the momentum of the light quark ,    the dirac marix @xmath195 for the light degrees of freedom appearing now in ( [ htltrg ] ) depends on @xmath194 and @xmath11 .",
    "it may be expanded in terms of the sixteen independent dirac matrices @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 , and @xmath200 taking into account that it has to behave like a pseudoscalar . the form factors appearing in the decomposition of @xmath195 depend on the variable @xmath201 , the energy of the light meson in the rest frame of the heavy one . in order to compare different heavy to light transition by employing heavy flavor symmetry",
    "this energy must be sufficiently small , since the typical scale for the light degrees of freedom has to be of the order of @xmath3 to apply heavy quark symmetry ranges between @xmath202 and @xmath203 where we have neglected the pion mass .",
    "thus at the upper end of phase space the variable @xmath201 scales with the heavy mass and heavy quark symmetries are not applicable any more . ] . for the case of a light pseudoscalar meson",
    "the most general decomposition of @xmath195 is @xmath204 where we have defined the dimensionless variable @xmath205    the form factors @xmath178 and @xmath128 are universal in the kinematic range of small energy of the light meson , i.e.  where the momentum transfer to the light degrees of freedom is of the order @xmath3 ; in this region @xmath206 is of order unity .",
    "this universality of the form factors may be used to relate various kinds of heavy to light transitions , e.g.  the semileptonic decays like @xmath207 , @xmath208 or @xmath209 and also the rare decays like @xmath210 or @xmath211 where @xmath212 denotes an electron or a muon .    as an example",
    "we give the relations between exclusive semileptonic heavy to light decays .",
    "the relevant hadronic current for this case may be expressed in terms of two form factors @xmath213 where @xmath214 inserting this into ( [ htlps ] )",
    "one may express @xmath215 in terms of the universal form factors @xmath178 and @xmath128 @xmath216 from these relations one may read off the scaling of the form factors with the heavy mass which was already derived in @xcite .",
    "this may be used to normalize the semileptonic @xmath128 decays into light mesons relative to the semileptonic @xmath16 decays .",
    "one obtains @xmath217 note that @xmath218 for the @xmath128 decay is expressed in terms of @xmath218 _ and _",
    "@xmath219 for the @xmath16 decays . in the limit of vanishing fermion masses",
    "only @xmath218 contributes , which means that the @xmath219 contribution to the rate is of the order of @xmath220 .",
    "thus it will be extremely difficult to determine experimentally .",
    "the case of a heavy meson decaying into a light vector meson may be treated similarly . the matrix element for the transition of a heavy meson into a light vector meson ( denoted generically as @xmath221 in the following )",
    "is given again by ( [ htlg ] ) and is in this case @xmath222 using ( [ htltrg ] ) one has @xmath223 where now the dirac matrix @xmath224 has to be a linear function of the polarization of the light vector meson .",
    "the most general decomposition is given in terms of four dimensionless form factors @xmath225 where the variable @xmath206 has been defined in ( [ eta ] ) .",
    "similar to the case of the decays into a light pseudoscalar meson ( [ htlvtr ] ) may be used to relate various exclusive heavy to light processes in the kinematic range where the energy of the outgoing vector meson is small .",
    "for example , the semileptonic decays @xmath226 , @xmath227 and @xmath228 are related among themselves and all of them may be related to the rare heavy to light decays @xmath229 and @xmath230 with @xmath231 .",
    "data on these decays are still very sparse ; there are first measurements of the decays @xmath232 and @xmath233 from cleo @xcite , from which total rates may be obtained . from this",
    "one may extract a value of @xmath234 by employing form factor models , and the value given by cleo is @xmath235 where the errors are purely experimental , while the range in the central value indicates the span obtained from a representative set of models . in order to perform a model independent determination along the lines discussed above a good measurement of the lepton energy spectra in these decays is needed .",
    "the standard model has turned out to be suprisingly successful and has passed many tests , in particular the very precise tests performed at the lep collider .",
    "however , these tests mainly concern the coupling of the gauge bosons to the fermions while the ckm sector of the standard model has not been tested with comparable accuracy .    to test this part of the standard model one has to investigate weak processes among quarks which are in general plagued with strong interaction uncertainties . in this respect",
    "the heavy mass limit has brought an enormous success ; hqet opens the unique possibility to determine some of the ckm matrix elements in a model independent way , thereby reducing uncertainties through models considerably .",
    "in particular , it allows to at least give the order of magnitude of the uncertainties involved , since hqet relies on an expansion in @xmath236 and @xmath4 .",
    "since the discovery of the heavy quark symmetries their phenomenological applications as well as the theoretical background have been studied intensively .",
    "the most prominent example is the determination of @xmath8 , which corresponds to a heavy to heavy transition . combining the method",
    "as described in this mini - review fo exclusive decays with the @xmath4 expansion for inclusive decays @xcite one may by now determine @xmath8 up to an uncertainty significantly less than ten percent .    in heavy to light decays heavy quark symmetries do not work as efficiently ; in this case only the relative normalization of @xmath128 decays versus the corresponding @xmath16 decays may be obtained . from the experimental side",
    "there are first measurements of @xmath232 and @xmath233 from the cleo collaboration and an extraction of the ckm matrix element @xmath234 from these processes is still to some extent model dependent .",
    "a more model independent extraction of this matrix element has to wait for more data , in particular a measurement of the lepton energy spectrum is needed to exploit the relative normalization from heavy quark symmetry .",
    "hqet does not yet have much to say about exclusive non - leptonic decays ; even for the decays @xmath237 , which involves three heavy quarks , heavy quark symmetries are not sufficient to yield useful relations between the decay rates @xcite .",
    "of course , with additional assumptions such as factorization one can go ahead and relate the non - leptonic decays to the semileptonic ones ; however , this is a very strong assumption and it is not clear in what sense factorization is an approximation . on the other side ,",
    "the data on the non - leptonic @xmath128 decays support factorization , and first attempts to understand this from qcd and hqet have been untertaken @xcite ; however , the problem of the exclusive non - leptonic decays still needs clarification and hopefully the heavy mass expansion will also be useful here .",
