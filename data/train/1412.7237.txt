    "strong bursts of decametric radio emission below 40 mhz were identified by @xcite as originating from jupiter .",
    "the emission in the decametric range ( referred to as dam range hereafter ) occurs from 3 mhz to 39.5 mhz , although specific io - related dam arcs have been seen at frequencies below 2 mhz @xcite .",
    "jovian dam has a peak of the spectral power at a frequency of about 10 mhz , and average fluxes of @xmath1 mjy watt m@xmath2 hz@xmath3 , as well as s - bursts that can be 100 times stronger @xcite .",
    "the lower - limit on observations from ground - based observatories is generally above 5 to 10 mhz due to attenuation by the earth s ionosphere .    from ground - based and space - based observations",
    ", it has been long known that much of the jupiter dam emission is influenced by the satellite io @xcite , and that some emissions not related to io have been correlated with solar wind parameters @xcite . for a review see @xcite .",
    "these coherent emissions are thought to be the result of instabilities near the local electron cyclotron frequency , called the cyclotron maser instability ( cmi ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "the cmi emission is beamed in a hollow cone with thickness of a few degrees @xcite which has a large half - angle of 60@xmath0 to 90@xmath0 relative to the local magnetic field direction @xcite .",
    "the dam emission is observed at earth when the edge of the emission cone sweeps over the observer .",
    "general properties of the dam emission include 1 ) high brightness temperatures , @xmath4 k , 2 ) emission at frequencies near the x - mode cutoff which is close to the local electron cyclotron frequency from both northern and southern hemisphere emission regions , and 3 ) 100% circular or elliptical polarization @xcite .",
    "the io - controlled jovian emission regions are designated io - a and io - b for the primarily right hand circular ( rhc ) emission sources in the northern hemisphere while the predominantly left hand circular ( lhc ) sources in the southern hemisphere are designated io - c and io - d .",
    "the handedness of the polarized emission is set by the direction of propagation of the emission relative to the local magnetic field direction as seen by the observer @xcite .",
    "these io - related emission regions are defined by their occurrence probability in the central meridian longitude ( ) and io - phase ( @xmath5 ) plane @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tbl : obs_time ]    the lwa1 has not yet been characterized for polarization response thus observations at large zenith angles are expected to have significant polarization leakage across the stokes parameters .",
    "determining the polarized response of a dipole array is considerably more difficult than for a single dish telescope .",
    "the reasons for this are : ( 1 ) dipole arrays produce beams with higher side lobe levels , therefore a significant contribution to the beam power comes from beyond the primary beam ; ( 2 ) the dipole array beam shape and sensitivity vary significantly across the sky . the first factor violates the usual assumption that the source polarization properties are constant in time ( or change only as a function of parallactic angle ) , and the second factor violates the assumption that the instrumental polarization is constant in time .",
    "we have minimized the impact of the lack of polarization calibration by observing jovian bursts at high elevations near transit . to characterize the impact of this leakage on the measured polarization ,",
    "we have compared the fractional circular polarization measured for jovian bursts with measurements from the literature . using io - b and io - c bursts",
    "we have measured the fractional circular polarization of the emission over zenith angles from @xmath6 20@xmath0 to over 50@xmath0 and compared those measurements to statistical measurements of fractional polarization of the same type of bursts observed with the nda as presented in @xcite .",
    "we find very good agreement between the lwa1 measured fractional polarization and the nda statistical results up to zenith angles of 40@xmath0 . at larger zenith angles",
    "we see an elevation dependent fractional polarization which is due to the lack of polarization calibration .",
    "a similar effect is seen observing cygnus a over a variety of zenith angles where the fractional circular polarization shows a slow increase with increasing zenith angle beyond roughly 50@xmath0 ( j.  hartman , 2012 , private communication ) .",
    "we would not expect that the lack of polarization calibration would change the handedness of the emission observed and , in fact , we find that the handedness of the emission observed in all bursts recorded with the lwa1 matches that expected from the literature . due to the lack of polarization calibration",
    ", we do not measure polarization fraction within this paper and report mainly the handedness of the emission as well as source structure .",
    "rfi is present in the data in both persistent form with known emitters spread throughout the spectrum as well as intermittent rfi events @xcite .",
    "observations were preferentially scheduled at night when rfi levels are lower but many of the observations had to be taken at least partially during the daytime to target high probability events in the observing cycle . for the majority of the jovian observations , we found that the rfi only impacted a small amount of the spectrum and thus we have not excised these regions . during quiescent rfi times",
    "we were easily able to study jovian emission down to frequencies of 12 mhz or lower ( see for example figure  [ fig:262 ] ) .",
    "lwa1 observations of jupiter were targeted during times of io - controlled emission . in this section",
    "we present analysis of bursts from all four of the io - controlled emissions regions . in table",
    "[ tbl : obs ] we list event details of each burst discussed in this paper while the observing session details are given in table  [ tbl : obs_time ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : prob ] we show a probability plot of the io phase vs with the positions of jupiter marked for each of the bursts discussed in this paper .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig:262 ] a stokes v spectrogram of an io - a / io - c event from 01-dec-2012 .",
    "the full observation lasts 5 hours and we have combined the data from the two frequency tunings .",
    "the colorbar at the right shows intensity ( labeled as power spectral density or psd ) with negative stokes v ( lhc ) emission in blue and positive stokes v ( rhc ) emission in red on a scale that is linear in power in arbitrary units .",
    "the ordinate axis shows observing frequency while the top abscissa is labeled in time since the start of the observation and the bottom abscissa is labeled in central meridian longitude system iii ( ) .",
    "the io - a event ( 185@xmath0 - 270@xmath0 ) shows classic vertex late arc structures , which are possibly caused by multiple alfvn wave reflections between the io plasma torus and the source regions @xcite .",
    "we see additional ( fainter ) rhc emission between = 270@xmath0 to roughly 350@xmath0 where it appears to drop below our observing frequency .",
    "this second rhc emission component appears distinct from the main io - a emission ; the overall intensity is weaker and the envelope reaches a higher frequency of @xmath635 mhz . @xcite studied similar io - c morphology using nda data from 1986 to 1991 and identified one rhc component ( called a great arc ) and three lhc components ( type i , ii , and iii ) .",
    "they interpret their data as components of io - c and suggest that both rhc and lhc emissions are coming from the same source in the same hemisphere .",
    "recent modulation lane analysis ( section  [ sect : modulation ] ) also favors this interpretation ; however , the different spectral structure and different frequency maxima of the rhc and lhc data are difficult to explain .",
    "we also note that bimodal polarizations emitted by the same source are not favored by theory @xcite .",
    "the lhc event begins at about 230@xmath0 and increases in frequency to reach a maximum frequency of @xmath624.5 mhz before decreasing again in frequency to fall below our observing band around = 350@xmath0 .",
    "we interpret this event as an io - c burst but we note that it begins well before the generally accepted beginning value of = 280@xmath0 for io - c events @xcite . although the previously published source boundaries are based on long - term statistics and are frequency dependent , individual io - c events beginning at values prior to 280@xmath0 have been shown before ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cml boundaries were not previous discussed , however , these new lwa1 observations suggest that the range for the io - c source needs refining .",
    "more precise source boundaries will be of value to theorists and modelers to better know the active cml regions and their associated magnetic field lines . furthermore we hope the lwa1 data can help disentangle the io - a from the io - c source(s ) and be used to determine the hemispheric source(s ) for the io - a and/or io - c components .        the vertex late arc structures characteristic of io - c events are clearly seen by the lwa1 . in figure  [ fig:262_l_zoom ] we show a higher resolution section of the lhc polarization in the lower frequency tuning for the portion of the burst from 10800 s onward .",
    "we can clearly see that the io - c event splits into at least two different structures near the end of the event .",
    "the very subtle , nearly horizontal amplitude modulations seen near 19 mhz in the burst emission are ionospheric faraday lanes induced in the highly elliptically polarized emission as it passes through the earth s ionosphere ( see figure  [ fig:288_fl ] for more obvious faraday lanes ) .    )",
    ".,width=316 ]            we have observed two other io - c events with the lwa1 and find remarkable similarity in the events . in figure  [ fig:996 ]",
    "we show the upper frequency tuning ( centered on 26 mhz ) for an io - c event from 10-mar-2012 .",
    "rhc emission is seen from the observation start at = 302@xmath0 until = 323@xmath0 , where the emission drops below an observing frequency of 17 mhz .",
    "the lhc emission is seen from the observation start until it falls below our band at @xmath6 = 342@xmath0 .",
    "similar to the burst described above , we interpret the rhc emission as a great arc and the lhc emission as io - c , most likely coming from the southern hemisphere .",
    "the io - c emission reaches a maximum frequency of roughly 25 mhz and shows the same vertex late arc structures as the previous burst .",
    "the third io - c event we present , figure  [ fig:357 ] , was observed on 06-mar-2013 for a total of 3.1 hours .",
    "the early portion of the observation shows the io - a emission in rhc ending around = 268@xmath0 while the lhc emission of the io - c event starts around = 277@xmath0 and runs past the end of our observing window . as with the other two events discussed above",
    ", the io - c emission shows the vertex late structure typical of these events .",
    "we measure a peak frequency of just above 24.6 mhz for the lhc io - c emission .",
    "similar to the other two events , we also see the great arc rhc emission co - incident with the io - c event between of roughly 275@xmath0 and 318@xmath0 before it drops below our upper tuning frequency .",
    "although the lower tuning is significantly impacted by rfi , we are able to continue tracing all rhc and lhc emission to frequencies near 12 mhz .        comparing the three events in figures  [ fig:262 ] to [ fig:357 ]",
    "we see that the overall picture is one of the io - a event ending before = 270@xmath0 followed by a rhc event which proceeds from higher frequencies ( 35 mhz ) around = 270@xmath0 to lower frequencies reaching up to 350@xmath0 before falling below our lowest frequency observing window .",
    "more surprisingly , the lhc io - c events appear to start at as early as 230@xmath0 at low frequencies ( 11 mhz ) , peaking at roughly 25 mhz near of 300@xmath0 to 315@xmath0 before falling again to frequencies as low as 11 mhz near of 345@xmath0 .",
    "the most recent event reported here ( 06-mar-2013 ) appears to have the io - c emission shifted in by at least 20@xmath0 compared to the event observed one year earlier .",
    "the typical range quoted for io - c events is 280@xmath0 - 60@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "observations of io - a / io - c storms with the nda are suggestive of an early start to the io - c , but there has not been any discussion or publications regarding the boundaries of the io - c source . in panel b of figure 1 in @xcite",
    "we see the rhc and lhc emission from an event on 15-oct 1987 that shows structure remarkably similar to the events presented herein in figures  [ fig:262 ] to [ fig:357 ] .",
    "@xcite note the occurrence of the lhc io - c emission in the same range as the rhc but do not trace the early start due to significant rfi present in the data below 20 mhz .",
    "polarization studies of jovian decametric emission using voyager planetary radio astronomy ( pra ) data by @xcite reported a change in the handedness of circular polarization of continuous dam emission below 15 mhz .",
    "@xcite showed that these anomalies and sign reversals in the polarization of the pra below 15 mhz can be explained by the antenna response when the dipole length is close to the observing frequency . using a model for the polarization response for the pra",
    ", @xcite were able to analyze the polarization properties of the hectometric emission and separate the contributions of two main sources of emission .",
    "they found these two sources had opposite handedness and independently changing intensities . due to the complexities of the higher frequency pra band , they were not able to map the polarization details of the dam . at these higher frequencies from voyager",
    "only total intensity analyses of jupiter s dam were made and thus it would have been very difficult to detect the early start of the io - c emission we observe with the lwa1 .",
    "io - b events are generally considered as originating in the northern hemisphere and are thought to represent the leading edge of the northern emission cone .",
    "in figure  [ fig:997_full ] we show the upper tuning ( centered at 26 mhz ) of a classic io - b observation from 11-mar-2012 . early in the event",
    "we see emission drifting upward in frequency and peaking about 35 mhz followed by a more narrow - band tail that drifts downward in frequency .",
    "the io - b source shows vertex early arc structure that have been well studied and modeled @xcite . as is common in io - b events ,",
    "s - bursts are seen in the early part of the event .",
    "we also see a faint , and more narrow - band lhc emission ranging from values of about 130@xmath0 to 180@xmath0 .",
    "this emission peaks about 21 mhz and is most likely southern hemisphere io - d emission .",
    "we discuss s - bursts in section  [ sect : sbursts ] and the io - d emission in section  [ sect : io - d ] .",
    "a very different io - b event showing a series of narrow - banded emission regions is shown in figure  [ fig:194_full ] .",
    "this observation covers a total of 2.5 hours .",
    "this entire event consists of narrow - band emission bands .",
    "analysis of the high temporal resolution spectrograms of this burst show a number of fine structure details such as s bursts and tilted v events . these latter events are seen as regions within narrow - band events that are bounded by two s bursts @xcite and are discussed further in section  [ sect : sbursts ] .",
    "the final io - b / io - d event we present is shown in figure  [ fig:288_full ] .",
    "this event is peculiar because the io - b emission cuts off sharply at 07:43 ut ( 121@xmath0 , io phase 100@xmath0 ) , presumably just as the source cone rotates past the earth . because the lwa1 off - beam data ( not shown here ) show good continuity over this interval , we believe that this sharp cutoff is real and displays the narrow beaming nature of the dam emission cones .",
    "figure  [ fig : prob ] shows that this event was a high pass through the io - b probability region on the io phase- plane .",
    "soon after the io - b cone moves out of our line of sight an io - d event begins .",
    "this event is seen as the lhc emission .",
    "unfortunately this observation ended at 09:40 ut ( 150@xmath0 , io phase 107@xmath0 ) just as io - d appeared to be reaching its peak frequency .",
    "the maximum frequency observed before the end of the observations was 22.5 mhz .",
    "this io - d event is also particularly interesting due to the detection of s - bursts within it ( see section  [ sect : d_fs ] ) .",
    "the leading edge of the southern emission cone is thought to be associated with io - d events .",
    "these sources are more elusive due to the lower emission intensity , lower emission frequency and the overlap of the source emission region with the same general and io phase ( @xmath7 ) range as the stronger io - b radiation .",
    "the and io phase ranges for the io - d source are = 0@xmath0 to 200@xmath0 and @xmath7 = 80@xmath0 to 130@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the io - d reaches down to frequencies of 3 mhz and that it appears as an isolated arc .",
    "their model argues for the io - d source in the southern hemisphere along a single io flux tube .",
    "we note that we did not specifically target io - d events during our initial observing program but several events were detected within the targeted io - b event observations . based on these detections ,",
    "we have initiated a follow - up observing program which specifically targets the io - d sources for detailed structure analysis and those results will be presented in a future paper .    in figure  [ fig:997_full ]",
    "we see evidence of weak , narrow - band lhc polarization extending over = 134@xmath0 to 185@xmath0 and @xmath7 = 93@xmath0 to 104@xmath0 . the emission is slowly drifting in time with the peak frequency moving from a maximum near 21 mhz to around 18 mhz .",
    "the emission characteristics of this io - d event are consistent with results from both nda and voyager data ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "structures identified in higher time - resolution images of this lhc emission are discussed in section  [ sect : d_fs ] .",
    "the second io - d event we present can be seen beginning near the end of the 27-dec-2012 event shown in figure  [ fig:288_full ] . shortly after the io - b emission cone passes out of our line - of - sight ,",
    "the lhc io - d emission begins .",
    "the emission is initially at very low frequencies ( @xmath6 13 mhz ) near 121@xmath0 .",
    "the emission frequency increases until the end of our observations at which point the peak frequency is near 22 mhz . due to the remarkably clean radio frequency interference spectrum at these low frequencies we are able to see evidence of both riihimaa modulation lanes as well as nearly horizontal , closely spaced faraday lanes that are clearly seen below 21 mhz across both the io - b and io - d emission regions .",
    "we show these faraday fringes in figure  [ fig:288_fl ] and discuss this further in section  [ sect : faraday ] .",
    "high time - resolution study of this io - d burst shows clear s - burst structure within the event . in section  [",
    "sect : d_fs ] we discuss the rare io - d fine structure and characterize the drift rate of these s - bursts .",
    "there are many examples of fine structures clearly seen in the lwa1 data .",
    "most of these structures have been seen by other ground - based and spacecraft observers @xcite in one or more io - controlled events .",
    "examples include frequency envelopes for different sources , nested arc features , narrow band events , modulation lanes , faraday lanes , and simple and complex s - bursts .",
    "we will highlight many of the excellent lwa1 observations and address these features in the sections below .",
    "jovian emission undergoes a variety of propagation effects as it passes from the emission cone near the planet through the magnetoionic plasma in the io torus , the interplanetary medium and the earth s ionosphere .",
    "@xcite identified a set of amplitude modulation lanes that cut across the l - bursts and s - bursts and which could have either positive or negative slopes .",
    "these modulation lanes are characterized by a strong periodicity in time , with periods ranging from about 1 to 5 sec and an average of about 2 sec .        in figure",
    "[ fig:288_mod_lanes ] , we show a small 120 second portion of the io - b event shown in figure  [ fig:288_full ] where positive slope modulation lanes are clearly visible .",
    "this image has a temporal resolution of 10 ms and spectral resolution of 10 khz .",
    "the modulation lanes show regular spacing crossing the io - b emission .",
    "slope measurements of the lines in the frequency range of 21 - 23 mhz in early parts of this 27-dec-2012 event show slopes consistent with measurements from @xcite .",
    "high temporal resolution spectrograms of the 10-mar-2012 event show modulation lanes visible through the rhc and lhc emission of this event ( figure  [ fig : mod_lanes ] ) .",
    "analysis of these lanes shows that they are continuous across the two different polarization hands @xcite .",
    "we defer a detailed analysis of this modulation lane structure to a future paper but do note that the detection of these modulation lanes may have very important implications for our understanding of the emission mechanism at jupiter . if both the rhc and lhc emission regions are shown to be crossed by continuous modulation lanes then , according to the widely accepted @xcite model , this would mean that the two polarization hands must be coming from sources in the _ same _ hemisphere .",
    "this would then suggest that the emission detected would be both the l - o and r - x modes of the cmi .",
    "one concern is that theoretical studies of the cmi emission mechanism of earth s auroral kilometric radiation ( akr ) , which is analogous to jovian dam emission , predict that the r - x mode growth rates up to two orders of magnitude larger than the l - o mode @xcite .",
    "observational studies of akr support these predictions @xcite .",
    "our data show roughly similar powers for both hands of polarization which may imply that other processes are necessary to explain the l - o emission , like refractions , reflections , or mode conversions .",
    "alternately , if the emissions are coming from opposite hemispheres , the propagation paths of each source emission through an interference screen that is comprised of field - aligned columns of enhanced plasma density from the io torus would need to be remarkably similar to form the continuous modulation lanes across both polarizations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "we have measured the slope of the modulations lanes for the above lwa1 events .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : slope_cml ] the measured slopes of several of the lwa1-detected modulation lanes included on the modulation lane plot of @xcite .",
    "each lwa1 slope is the mean of independent slope measurements for 5 consecutive modulation lanes around the plotted .",
    "the figure shows the modulation lane slopes we measure are consistent with earlier papers although we note that we do detect modulation lanes in io - c regions of the plot that are currently sparsely populated .",
    "we defer a detailed modulation lane slope analysis with many more measurements to a future paper .",
    "highly elliptically polarized emission passing through dense plasma media , such as jupiter s io plasma torus plus magnetosphere and the earth s ionosphere , will undergo faraday rotation due to the bi - refringent nature of the magnetized and ionized plasma .",
    "each magneto - ionic medium between the source and observer will introduce a rotation measure ( rm ) in the polarized jovian emission where @xcite show the faraday rotation measure along some path @xmath8 is defined as : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the electron charge , @xmath11 is the mass of the electron , @xmath12 is the speed of light , @xmath13 is the electron density at each point @xmath14 along the path , and @xmath15 is line of sight component of the magnetic field at point @xmath14 .",
    "there are at least four distinct contributions to the observed faraday rotation of jovian decametric emission .",
    "these are ( 1 ) the jovian magnetosphere , ( 2 ) the io plasma torus , ( 3 ) the interplanetary medium , and ( 4 ) the earth s ionosphere .",
    "each of these components will make a time - variable contribution to the observed faraday rotation .",
    "taking into account the propagation effects from these media , @xcite used io - b events observed from the nda to determine that at least some of the faraday rotation comes from the io plasma torus .",
    "the fraction of faraday rotation from each of the components above is unclear from work in the literature and is discussed in some detail in @xcite .",
    "the majority of the rm signal likely comes from the earth s ionosphere which has typical electron density of @xmath16 @xmath17 , field strength of @xmath18 g , and a path length of 500 km .",
    "this results in a contribution of roughly rm@xmath19 rad / m@xmath20 .",
    "linearly polarized feeds , such as used at lwa1 , will detect the emission with a time - variable visibility in each of the two orthogonal polarizations .",
    "we have investigated several of the bursts using the orthogonal linear polarizations from the lwa1 and see clear evidence of faraday fringes .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig:288_fl ] a linear polarization difference spectrogram of a portion of the 27-dec-2012 io - b / io - d event with clear nearly horizontal faraday fringes .",
    "similar faraday fringes have been seen for the io - b event on 11-mar-2012 .",
    "we have used the locations of the nulls in the latter event to determine the rotation measure of rm=2.2 rad m@xmath2 which is similar to the expected contribution from the earth s ionosphere .      in this section",
    "we discuss some of the fine structure seen in the lwa1 observations of the jovian bursts .",
    "short bursts of emission , known as s - bursts , are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "these sources consist of a series of very short pulses of emission that range in length from 1 ms to several hundred ms .",
    "the instantaneous emission is very narrow in frequency and typical drift rates are between -5 and -30 mhz / s @xcite .",
    "drift rates have been measured for s - burst seen in io - b and io - c events , and more rarely in io - a events @xcite .",

    "these events are relatively rare and consist of narrow frequency bands with trains of emission that can drift up or down with time .",
    "the n - events are often either composed of short s - bursts of multiple split bands of emission .",
    "typical bandwidths are 200 - 600 khz with durations of a few seconds to tens of minutes .",
    "these events are also seen to drift slowly in frequency with time in some cases .",
    "@xcite studied the occurrence of the n - events and found they are often seen over a wide range of .",

    "figure  [ fig : iob_sn_wide ] shows a short @xmath6 1.8 s long portion of the burst with 0.25 ms temporal resolution and 10 khz spectral resolution for a 9.2 mhz wide frequency window centered around 21.8 mhz .",
    "we see that the portion of the spectrum between 21 and 25 mhz is largely dominated by s - bursts while below 21 mhz there is a mix of s - bursts and n - events .",
    "we have measured the slopes of the s - bursts in several regions of the io - b event and find values of around -15 mhz / s , consistent with typical values for io - b events reported in the literature ( see figure 3 in * ? ? ?",

    "more complex s - burst interactions with n - events are seen below 23 mhz in figure  [ fig : iob_sn_wide ] where there appears to be multiple instances of n - events terminating at the time when an s - burst passes through the same frequency as the n - event . in figure",

    "multiple s - bursts appear to be generated after the termination of the n - event starting at frequencies of 23.2 mhz and with slopes of -16.3 mhz / s .",
    "analysis of high temporal resolution data on this event appears to show that there are several regions where the s - bursts and short n - events are apparently interacting .",
    "this would suggest that the source regions for each type of event are cospatial .",
    "previous observations have been made that show interactions between n - events and s - bursts , referred to as s - n burst events @xcite .",
    "the s - n burst events typically occur between 20 - 24 mhz and show an inverted `` tilted - v '' shape in the spectrum that connects the s - burst with the n event .",

    "thus these s - n burst events are believed to be generated in the same region in jupiter s magnetosphere ; our observations of s- and n - events shown in figures  [ fig : iob_sn_wide ] and [ fig : iob_sn_zoom ] are consistent with this interpretation .",
    "more high resolution observations of the io - b source using the lwa instrument may provide some additional clues as to the nature and origin of these peculiar events .          very little information is available in the literature regarding the io - d events . in general , the io - d emission seems to be characterized by relatively narrow emission seen over a wide range of and confined to frequencies below @xmath6 18 mhz @xcite .",
    "we have undertaken high temporal resolution studies of the io - d emission from the 27-dec-2012 event and we see clear s - bursts during this lhc emission event",
    ". a short portion of the spectrum ( @xmath6 1.44 s ) is shown in figure  [ fig : iod_sbursts ] where we show the region of the spectrum from @xmath6 15 mhz to 18 mhz .",
    "we measure drift rates of the io - d s - bursts of -11 to -15 mhz / s at frequencies of 15 to 16 mhz which are consistent with drift rates from other io sources .",
    "there are few discussions in the literature regarding s - burst detections during known io - d events , and only one definitive event could be found in the literature ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . because both io - b and io - d have significant overlap in cml , it is difficult to distinguish the io - related source of the s - bursts",
    "there is some possible evidence showing io - d related s - bursts in the voyager pra data ( see @xcite ) and cassini radio and plasma wave science ( rpws ) data ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in figure  [ fig : iod_997 ] we show the details of the lhc io - d emission from the 11-march-2012 event with 0.25 ms temporal resolution and 10 khz spectral resolution .",
    "the figure shows a window of 1.7 s and a frequency window of 2.6 mhz centered around 19.1 mhz .",
    "the emission is seen to consist of several narrow bands of emission at frequencies near 20 mhz as well as s - bursts at frequencies between 18 and 20 mhz .",
    "we note that the horizontal structures seen in the figure are rfi .",
    "analysis of additional sections of the io - d emission show structures such as tilted - v events and other narrow - band structures .",
    "more observations are currently being conducted in an effort to further characterize the fine structure of the io - d events which can be useful in understanding the electron acceleration method and the source generation mechanism .",
    "the long wavelength array ( lwa1 ) instrument is shown to be an excellent instrument for studies of jupiter decametric radio emission ( dam ) .",
    "the large bandwidth , fine spectral and temporal resolution , and full stokes capabilities of the lwa1 instrument allow for a comprehensive analysis of jupiter s broad and fine dam structures .",
    "the location and low rfi environment are suitable to measure jupiter s emissions down to about 11 mhz , well below most other earth - based radio telescopes .",
    "this overview paper of targeted io - related jovian dam emissions not only highlights the capabilities of the lwa1 instrument , but also provides some new data and insight into the nature of jupiter s decametric emissions .",
    "the jupiter observations from dec-2011 to mar-2013 highlighted in this paper show good io - a , io - b , io - c , and io - d structures , and the broad and fine detail in these data are further enhanced by the excellent polarization capabilities of the lwa1 instrument .",
    "data reduction and analysis show some characteristic io - related spectral signatures but also show some fine structures and details not seen before .",
    "a summary of the findings follows .",
    "the io - a observations show characteristic vertex - late arc structures as well as some narrow band emission events at frequencies below 19 mhz ( see figure  [ fig:262 ] ) .",
    "the remarkable observations are the io - c emissions that occur simultaneously with the io - a emissions .",
    "the onset of the lhc io - c emissions at 11 mhz was measured to be 230@xmath0 ; this has not been clearly measured before and allows the extent of the io - c source to be significantly expanded .",
    "the cml range of the io - c source can tentatively be defined as 230@xmath0 @xmath22 60@xmath0 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* previous range was 280@xmath0 @xmath22 60@xmath0 ) .",
    "further observations are warranted , but this can give clues to the nature and geometry of the southern hemisphere emission regions and be of value to new decameter emission models .",
    "in addition , the rhc component emissions from io - c are seen in excellent detail ; these observations , along with modulation lane measurements , give additional evidence that may suggest that both rhc and lhc emissions are coming from the same hemisphere source regions .",
    "observations of io - b and io - d emissions are clearly seen with the dual polarization lwa1 measurements .",
    "the io - b data show characteristic arc and nested band structures , normal envelope and tail structures due to source geometry and beaming , and characteristic s - bursts that occur early in the io - b events .",
    "the io - d events are easily seen and analyzed with the lwa1 instrument .",
    "the io - d events show characteristic lhc polarization and one event ( figure  [ fig:997_full ] ) shows narrow band structure .",
    "the lwa1 instrument shows excellent fine structure in jupiter s emission .",
    "modulation lanes are clearly seen in both polarizations and drift rate measurements are consistent with earlier results .",
    "however , modulation lane measurements from one io - a / io - c event where both polarizations are observed simultaneously ( figure  [ fig : mod_lanes ] ) might provide good constraints on the emission theory and growth mechanisms .",
    "more detailed analysis of additional io - a / io - c events are underway to further investigate the modulation lane details .",
    "faraday fringes are also clearly seen in the lwa1 data and provide clues about the local conditions at the emission source , in the io plasma torus , and the earth s ionosphere .    finally , and perhaps most interestingly , we have made excellent spectral and temporal measurements of s - bursts , n - events , and s - n events .",
    "first we have clearly detected s - bursts in the io - d source , a measurement that is rare and will be useful to help understand the mechanism of s - burst emission .",
    "drift rates of -12 mhz / s were measured for the io - d region and are consistent with known drift rates from other io - related sources .",
    "several n - events are seen in our data in io - a , io - b , and io - d events , but most interesting are the s - n events seen in an io - b observation ( figures  [ fig : iob_sn_wide]-[fig : iob_sn_zoom ] ) .",
    "these events display complex interaction where s - bursts appear to quench n - events , and n - events may trigger more s - bursts .",
    "these effects demonstrate that the emission mechanisms for the s - n events are similar and/or interacting , and that they are generated in the same spatial location . as mentioned previously , more observations of io - d",
    "are being made in anticipation of further study of the s - bursts measured with the lwa1 instrument .",
