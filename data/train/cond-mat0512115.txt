    "commensurate elastic scattering , with an in - plane correlation length of 150   , was also present for temperatures below @xmath281  k ; however , the growth of the elastic intensity did not change on crossing the superconducting .",
    "while the magnetic excitations are commensurate and incompatible with stripe correlations , there are , nevertheless , other measurements that suggest electronic inhomogeneity .",
    "@xcite used the crystal - field excitations of the pr ions in  as a probe of the local environment .",
    "they found evidence for several distinct local environments , and argued that doped regions reached the percolation limit at @xmath278 , at the phase boundary for superconductivity .",
    "recent nmr studies have also found evidence of electronic inhomogeneity @xcite .    motivated by the observation of magnetic - field - induced magnetic superlattice peaks in hole - doped cuprates (  [ sc : mag_field ] ) , there has been a series of experiments looking at the effect on electron - doped cuprates of a field applied along the @xmath10 axis .",
    "an initial study @xcite on  with @xmath282 and @xmath283  k found that applying a field as large as 10  t had no effect on the intensity of an antiferromagnetic bragg peak for temperatures down to 15  k. shortly after that came a report @xcite of large field - induced enhancements of antiferromagnetic bragg intensities , as well as new field - induced peaks of the type @xmath284 , in a crystal of  with @xmath260 and @xmath285  k. it was soon pointed out that the new @xmath284 peaks , as well as most of the effects at antiferromagnetic reflections , could be explained by the magnetic response of the ( nd , ce)@xmath2o@xmath30 impurity phase @xcite . there",
    "now seems to be a consensus that this is the proper explanation @xcite ; however , a modest field - induced intensity enhancement has been seen at @xmath286 that is not explained by the impurity - phase model @xcite .    in an attempt to clarify the situation , fujita _",
    "@xcite turned to another electron - doped superconductor , pr@xmath274lace@xmath181cuo@xmath78 .",
    "this compound also has to be reduced to obtain superconductivity , and reduced crystals exhibit a ( pr , ce)@xmath2o@xmath30 impurity phase ; however , the pr in the impurity phase should not be magnetic .",
    "they found a weak field - induced enhancement of an antiferrromagnetic peak intensity for a crystal with @xmath287 ( @xmath288  k ) , but no effect for @xmath260 ( @xmath289  k ) .",
    "the induced cu moment for @xmath287 at a temperature of 3  k and a field of 5  t is @xmath290 @xmath76 .",
    "dai and coworkers @xcite have studied crystals of pr@xmath291lace@xmath292cuo@xmath293 in which they have tuned the superconductivity by adjusting @xmath294 .",
    "they have emphasized the coexistence of the superconductivity with both 3d and quasi-2d antiferromagnetic order @xcite .",
    "they report a very slight enhancement of the quasi-2d antiferromagnetic signal for a @xmath10-axis magnetic field @xcite .",
    "there are a number of trends in hole - doped cuprates that one can identify from the results presented in this chapter . to begin with ,",
    "the undoped parent compounds are mott - hubbard ( or , more properly , charge - transfer ) insulators that exhibit nel order due to antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions between nearest - neighbor atoms .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath1 is material dependent , varying between roughly 100 and 150 mev .",
    "doping the cuo@xmath2 planes with holes destroys the nel order ; in fact , the presence of holes seems to be incompatible with long - range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the observed responses to hole doping indicate that some sort of phase separation is common . in some cases , stripe modulations",
    "are found , and in others , finite clusters of antiferromagnetic order survive .    in under- and optimally - doped cuprate superconductors ,",
    "the magnetic spectrum has an hour - glass - like shape , with an energy scale comparable to the superexchange energy of the parent insulators .",
    "the strength of the magnetic scattering , when integrated over momentum and energy , decreases gradually as one increases the hole concentration from zero to optimal doping .",
    "a spin gap appears in the superconducting state ( at least for optimal doping ) , with spectral weight from below the spin gap being pushed above it .",
    "the magnitude of the spin gap correlates with @xmath178 .",
    "underdoped cuprates with a small or negligible spin gap are very sensitive to perturbations . substituting non - magnetic zn for cu or applying a magnetic field",
    "perpendicular to the planes tends to induce elastic incommensurate magnetic peaks at low temperature . for samples with larger spin gaps , the perturbations shift spectral",
    "weight from higher energy into the spin gap .",
    "breaking the equivalence between orthogonal cu - o bonds within a cuo@xmath2 plane can result in charge - stripe order , in addition to the elastic magnetic peaks .",
    "the magnetic correlations within the cuo@xmath2 planes are clearly quite sensitive to hole doping and superconductivity .",
    "while their coexistence with a metallic normal state is one of the striking characteristics of the cuprates , their connection to the mechanism of hole - pairing remains a matter of theoretical speculation .",
    "the nature and relevance of antiferromagnetic correlations has been a major theme of much of the theoretical work on cuprate superconductors .",
    "while some the theoretical concepts are discussed in more detail in other chapters of this book , it seems appropriate to briefly review some of them here .",
    "given that techniques for handling strongly - correlated hole - doped antiferromagnets continue to be in the development stage , some researchers choose to rely on a conventional weak - coupling approach to describing magnetic metals",
    ". this might be appropriate if one imagines starting out in the very over - doped regime , where fermi - liquid theory might be applicable , and then works downward towards optimum doping .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility can be calculated in terms of electrons being excited across the fermi level from filled to empty states .",
    "interactions between quasiparticles due to coulomb or exchange interactions are assumed to enhance the susceptibility near , and this is handled using the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) . in the superconducting state , one takes into account the superconducting gap @xmath295 with @xmath56-wave symmetry .",
    "the gapping of states carves holes into the continuum of electron - hole excitations .",
    "the rpa enhancement can then pull resonant excitations down into the region below @xmath296 @xcite . with this approach ,",
    "it has been possible , with suitable adjustment of the interaction parameter , to calculate dispersing features in @xmath33 that resemble those measured in the superconducting state of optimally - doped  @xcite .",
    "the rpa approach runs into difficulties when one considers , , and underdoped .",
    "it predicts that the magnetic excitations should be highly over damped at energies greater than @xmath296 ; however , there is no obvious change in the experimental spectra at @xmath297 in these materials .",
    "furthermore , the dispersive features in  are observed in the normal state .",
    "even if one tries to invoke a @xmath56-wave pseudogap , the energy scale is likely to be too small , as indicated by fig .",
    "[ fg : er](b ) .",
    "it is also unclear how one would rationalize , from a fermi - liquid perspective , the observation that the energy scale of the magnetic excitations is of order @xmath1 , as superexchange is an effective interaction between local moments in a correlated insulator , and has no direct connection to interactions between quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "the fact that superexchange seems to remain relevant in the superconducting phase suggests that it may be profitable to approach the problem from the perspective of doped antiferromagnets .",
    "the resonating - valence - bond model was one of the first such attempts @xcite .",
    "the model is based on the assumption that the undoped system is a quantum spin liquid .",
    "in such a state , all cu spins would be paired into singlets in a manner such that the singlet - triplet spectrum is gapless .",
    "when a hole is introduced , one singlet is destroyed , yielding a free spinon ; all other cu spins still couple in singlet states .",
    "in such a picture , one would expect that the singlet - triplet excitations would dominate the magnetic excitation spectrum measured with neutrons ; surprisingly , there has been little effort to make specific theoretical predictions of this spectrum for comparison with experiment . instead , the analysis has been done in terms of electron - hole excitations @xcite . as discussed above ,",
    "such a calculation has significant short comings when it comes to understanding underdoped cuprates .",
    "another alternative is a spiral spin - density wave , as has been proposed several times @xcite .",
    "a spiral state would be compatible with the incommensurate antiferromagnetic excitations at low energy @xcite , and can also be used to model the full magnetic spectrum @xcite . a look at",
    "the experimental record shows that a spiral phase can not be the whole story . in the case of  and ,",
    "where static magnetic order is observed , charge order is also found @xcite .",
    "when there is charge order present , it follows that the spin - density modulation must have a collinear component in which the magnitude of the local moments is modulated @xcite .",
    "there could also be a spiral component , but it is not essential . furthermore",
    ", if holes simply cause a local rotation of the spin direction , then it is unclear why the ordering temperature of the nel phase is so rapidly reduced by a small density of holes .",
    "given that stripe order is observed in certain cuprates (  [ sc : cu_stripes ] ) and that the magnetic excitations of the stripe - ordered phase are consistent with the universal spectrum of good superconductors ( fig .  [ fg : lbco_disp ] ) , the simplest picture that is compatible with all of the data is to assume that charge stripes ( dynamic ones in the case of the superconducting samples ) are a common feature of the cuprates , at least on the underdoped side of the phase diagram .",
    "there is certainly plenty of theoretical motivation for stripes @xcite , and the relevance of charge inhomogeneity to the superconducting mechanism is discussed in the chapter by kivelson and fradkin @xcite .",
    "one suprising experimental observation is the minimal amount of damping of the magnetic excitations in underdoped cuprates , especially in the normal state .",
    "one would expect the continuum of electron - hole excitations to cause significant damping @xcite .",
    "could it be that the antiphase relationship of spin correlations across a charge stripe acts to separate the spin and charge excitations in a manner similar to that in a one - dimensional system @xcite ?",
    "with over doping , there is evidence that regions of conventional electronic excitations become more significant .",
    "this is also the regime where magnetic excitations become weak .",
    "could it be that the interaction of conventional electron - hole excitations with stripe - like patches causes a strong damping of the spin excitations ?",
    "there is clearly plenty of work left to properly understand the cuprates .",
