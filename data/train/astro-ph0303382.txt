    "the analysis of the statistical properties ( luminosity function and clustering ) of the cosmic structures is a fundamental cosmological tool to understand their formation and evolution .",
    "the clustering of qsos and galaxies at small to intermediate scales ( 1 - 50 @xmath15 mpc ) provides detailed information on the distribution of dark matter halos ( dmhs ) that are generally thought to constitute the `` tissue '' on which cosmic structures form .",
    "this means to investigate indirectly fundamental astrophysical problems , such as the nature of dark matter , the growth of structures via gravitational instability , the primordial spectrum of density fluctuations and its transfer function .",
    "the lighting up of galaxies and other luminous objects , such as qsos , involves complex and non - linear physics .",
    "it depends on how the baryons cool within the dmhs and form stars or start accreting onto the central black hole ( bh ) , ending up as the only directly visible peak of a much larger , invisible structure .",
    "the so - called bias factor , @xmath16 , is used to explain the difference between visible structures and invisible matter , whose gravity governs the overall evolution of clustering .",
    "this complex relation is summarized by the simple formula @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the two - point correlation functions ( tpcf ) of radiating objects and dark matter , respectively . in this way",
    "the detailed analysis of the distribution of the peaks of visible matter can distinguish among the various models for the formation of structures .",
    "in particular the _ hierarchical growth of structures _ is naturally predicted in a cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario , where larger objects are constantly formed from the assembly of smaller ones .",
    "an alternative view of the structure formation and evolution , supported by both some observed properties of high - redshift ellipticals and eros @xcite and theoretical modeling @xcite , leads to the scenario of _ monolithic collapse _ , i.e. an earlier object formation and a following passive evolution .",
    "the clustering data can be used to discuss whether the merging processes were important at various redshifts or the galaxy number tends to be conserved during the evolution .",
    "these two opposite models predict a significantly different redshift evolution of the bias factor @xcite .",
    "the first attempt to measure the clustering of qsos was made by @xcite .",
    "@xcite was the first to detect qso clustering on small scales using the @xcite catalog , a collection of inhomogeneous samples .",
    "a number of authors @xcite have used complete and better defined qso samples to measure their spatial distribution . at a mean redshift of @xmath20",
    ", they generally detect a clustering signal at a typical significance level of @xmath21 , corresponding to a correlation length , @xmath22 , similar to the value obtained for local galaxies : @xmath23 mpc .",
    "however , there has been significant disagreement over the redshift evolution of qso clustering , including claims for a decrease of @xmath22 with redshift @xcite , an increase of @xmath22 with redshift @xcite and no change with redshift @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite , using more than 10,000 objects taken from the preliminary data release catalog of 2df qso redshift survey ( hereafter 2qz ) , measured the evolution of qso clustering as a function of redshift . assuming an einstein - de sitter universe ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) , they found no significant evolution for @xmath22 in comoving coordinates over the redshift range @xmath26 , whereas for a model with @xmath27 and @xmath28 the clustering signal shows a marginal increase at high redshift . here",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 are the mass and cosmological constant density contribution , respectively , to the total density of the universe .",
    "the observed behavior of the qso clustering can be explained within the linear theory and a typical bias model .",
    "the theoretical interpretation of the picture drawn by 2qz is a result of the combination of many ingredients and their degeneracies : the bias factor , the ratio between the masses of black hole and dark matter halo , the life - time of qsos , the efficiency and the mass accretion rate .",
    "to add new insights in the modeling and interpretation , one has to consider the constraints from the luminosity function ( lf ) or / and to enlarge the redshift domain toward lower or higher redshifts . for these reasons ,",
    "we have started a project , the aerqs , to find bright agn in the local universe , removing present uncertainties about the properties of the local qso population and setting the zero point for clustering evolution .",
    "for the general aims of the aerqs survey and its detailed presentation [ see @xcite ] .",
    "the goal of this paper is to analyze the clustering properties of a well defined large sample of bright qsos at @xmath1 , and provide key information on the following issues : _ what is the typical mass of dmhs hosting agn ?",
    "what is the typical bias factor for agn ?",
    "what is the duty cycle for agn activity ?",
    "what is the typical efficiency of the central engine at the various redshifts ? _    the plan of the paper is as follows . in   2 we describe the data used in the statistical analysis .",
    "the various techniques used to investigate the clustering properties are presented in   3 , while   4 is devoted to a comparison with similar results obtained by previous surveys at low redshifts . to investigate the redshift evolution of the clustering ,",
    "the spatial properties of qsos in the local universe are compared in   5 to the recent 2qz results at intermediate redshifts for qsos and to various estimates for normal and peculiar galaxies . in   6 physically motivated models are used to link the galactic structures at high-@xmath31 with the local agn and galaxy population . in   7",
    "we discuss the clustering properties of qsos in the light of these simple theoretical models . finally   8 gives some concluding remarks on the clustering of qsos .",
    "it is paradoxical that in the era of 2qz and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , with thousands of faint qsos discovered up to the highest redshifts , there are still relatively few bright qsos known at low redshift .",
    "one of the main reasons , as shown in previous papers @xcite , is the rather low surface density of low-@xmath31 and bright qsos , of the order of few times @xmath32 per deg@xmath33 .",
    "this corresponds to a very small number of objects also in the case of the 750 deg@xmath33 of the complete 2qz and 1000 deg@xmath33 of the sdss ( during commissioning phase ) .",
    "one more reason , not less important than the previous one , is that with the optical information only it is difficult to efficiently isolate bright qsos from billions of stars in large areas . as a consequence ,",
    "a survey based on different selection criteria is required . in @xcite",
    "we have used the x - ray emission , a key feature of the agn population .",
    "the aerqs is divided in three sub - samples , two in the northern hemisphere ( usno and gsc ) , described in @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) , and the dss sample in the southern hemisphere , described in @xcite ( paper ii ) . after a campaign of spectroscopic identifications at various telescopes ,",

    "more interesting is the comparison of the observed @xmath160 with the theoretical predictions obtained assuming different @xmath186 . for the @xmath14 model the aerqs value corresponds to @xmath208 ( 1@xmath8 error bars ) , and the observed trend is consistent with the bias evolution expected for dark halos with a minimum mass almost constant in redshift ( @xmath209 ) . on the contrary , for the scdm model it is impossible to reproduce the bias factor using a constant minimum mass : while the value for aerqs suggests @xmath210 ( always 1@xmath8 error bars ) , the bias factor corresponds to halos with @xmath211 at @xmath212 and @xmath213 at @xmath214 .    in fig .

    "for example , it is quite possible that merging could play a different role at different redshifts .",
    "present - day agn , for example , have clearly not just formed at the present epoch since their observational properties suggest a lack of mergers in the recent past . on the other hand ,",
    "it is plausible that qsos at much higher redshifts , say @xmath222 , are undergoing merging on the same timescale as the parent halos .",
    "this suggests the possible applicability of a model where rapid merging works at high redshifts , but it ceases to dominate at lower redshifts and the bias then evolves by equation ( [ eq : b_cons ] ) until now . in this context",
    "it is interesting to note that , while @xmath190 is a free parameter in equation ( [ eq : b_cons ] ) , it is actually predicted , once the appropriate minimum mass is specified .",

    "the result , shown as solid line in the bottom - right panel of fig .",
    "[ conserving ] , is in rough agreement with the observational data , indicating that the redshift @xmath175 , where the transition between the two different regimes occurs , is located at approximately @xmath230 .",
    "of course , a validation of this model requires more robust estimates of the qso clustering properties .",
    "as discussed in the previous paragraphs , there are empirical and theoretical evidences that qsos are biased with respect to the matter distribution .",
    "the results of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite are consistent , within the uncertainties , with the present results .",

    ", the general picture emerging from the observational data is that the clustering evolution for galaxies is similar to the qso one : at low-@xmath31 , the correlation length is decreasing from the local value reaching a minimum at @xmath288 , then it increases till @xmath289 . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "the term `` evolution '' has not to be considered literally . given a survey defined by its characteristic limiting magnitude and surface brightness , the galaxies observed at high-@xmath31 typically have higher luminosities .",
    "therefore , the intrinsic differences of the galaxy properties at different @xmath31 can mimic an evolution , i.e. the evolution measured in a flux - limited survey is not only due to the evolution of a unique population but can be due to a change of the observed population .",
    "the picture emerging from qso clustering points in the same direction : qsos are not part of a unique population , due to their short duty - cycle , and are intrinsically related with galaxy evolution .    at this stage",
    ", it is important to discuss how the clustering depends on absolute magnitude .",
    "moreover , we should consider how the bias factor changes when the catalog selection effects are considered , i.e. when the theoretical quantities , as the mass @xmath169 , are substituted by the observational ones , such as the luminosity @xmath290 .",
    "chosen one of the previously described models , one will end up with the quantity @xmath168 to be understood as ` the bias that objects of mass @xmath169 have at redshift @xmath31 ' .",
    "the effective bias at that redshift can be written more precisely as ( see also martini & weinberg 2001 ) @xmath291 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath292 and @xmath293 is the _ observed _ luminosity function of the catalog , i.e. the intrinsic luminosity function multiplied by the catalog selection function , which will typically involve a cut in apparent magnitude , whatever wave - band is being used .",
    "@xcite observed a weak trend of the clustering strength with the magnitude , brighter objects being more clustered .",
    "such a behavior can be understood by focusing on the results obtained in the previous paragraph .",
    "the efficiency and the accretion rate for local agn determine the relation between mass and luminosity , and how they evolve with redshift .",
    "as a simple consequence , for qsos at different epochs , luminosity does not necessarily trace mass .",
    "the dependence of clustering strength on the luminosity is thus weaker than the one expected in theoretical models assuming a fixed @xmath294 ratio .",
    "eros and rgs at @xmath288 have higher correlation amplitude than qsos at the same redshift ; indeed they are following slow or passive evolution . probably at @xmath144",
    "they will plausibly become the brightest and most massive galaxies inside the clusters .",
    "qsos , instead , show a different evolution for the tpcf : their behavior is consistent with that of a typical merging model at high-@xmath31 and a passive evolution or object - conserving at low-@xmath31 .",
    "@xcite explored theoretically the possibility of using the cross - correlation between qsos and galaxies , @xmath295 , to obtain new information on the masses of dmhs hosting qsos .",
    "they used a semi - analytical model in which super - massive bhs are formed and fueled during major mergers .",
    "the resulting dmh masses can be in principle used to estimate the typical qso life - time . in current redshift surveys , like the 2dfgrs or sdss",
    ", these measurements will constrain the life - times of low-@xmath31 qsos more accurately than qso auto - correlation function , because galaxies have much higher a space density than qsos . as a result",
    ", @xmath295 can yield information about the processes responsible for fueling smbhs .",
    "the asiago - eso / rass qso survey ( aerqs ) , an all - sky complete sample of 392 spectroscopically identified objects ( @xmath296 ) at @xmath1 , has been used to carry out an extended statistical analysis of the clustering properties of local qsos .",
    "the aerqs makes it possible to remove present uncertainties about the properties of the local qso population and fix an important zero point for the clustering evolution and its theoretical modeling . with such a data - set ,",
    "the evolutionary pattern of qsos between the present epoch and the highest redshifts is tied down .",
    "on the basis of the ( integrated and differential ) two - point correlation functions , we have detected a @xmath3 clustering signal , corresponding to a correlation length @xmath4 mpc and a bias factor @xmath205 in a @xmath14 model .",
    "a similar value of @xmath22 , but corresponding to @xmath204 , is obtained for an einstein - de sitter model , confirming previous analysis @xcite .",
    "these results shows that low - redshift qsos are clustered in a similar way to radio galaxies , eros and early - type galaxies , while the comparison with recent results from the 2qz at higher redshifts shows that the correlation function of qsos is constant in redshift or marginally increasing toward low redshifts .",
    "this behavior can be interpreted with physically motivated models , taking into account the non - linear dynamics of the dark matter distribution , the redshift evolution of the bias factor , the past light - cone and redshift - space distortion effects .",
    "the application of these models allows us to derive constraints on the typical mass of the dark matter halos hosting qsos : we have found @xmath297 ( the mass is units of @xmath298 ) , almost independently of the cosmological model . using the abundance of dark matter halos with this minimum mass and assuming the relation found by @xcite between the masses of dark matter halos and active black holes , from the clustering data we can directly infer an estimate for the mass of the central active black holes and for their life - time , @xmath299 ( @xmath300 ) and @xmath301 yr ( @xmath302 yr ) , respectively .",
    "this means that local agn seem to accrete in a sub - eddington regime .",
    "all these values have been obtained for a @xmath14 model ; slightly shorter duty cycles are derived for an einstein - de sitter model .",
    "the time - life of @xmath250 qsos is @xmath303 , measured by @xcite .",
    "this could be a first indication that qsos at all epochs have a similar life - time , which does not depend strongly on the hubble time .",
    "observational data suggest that most nearby galaxies contain central super - massive black holes , supporting the idea that most galaxies pass through a qso / agn phase . however , the different clustering properties , together with the the short lifetimes derived for local agn , suggest that this phase picks out a particular time in the evolution of galaxies , e.g. epochs of major star formation , interactions or merging . in this way",
