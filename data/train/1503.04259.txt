    "<S> resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) tuned for the cu @xmath0 edge is a possible tool to detect charge excitations in cuprate superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> we theoretically investigate the possibility for observing a collective charge excitation by the rixs . </S>",
    "<S> the rixs process via the intermediate state inevitably makes the spectral weight of charge excitation stronger in electron doping than in hole doping . </S>",
    "<S> electron - hole asymmetry also appears in the dynamical charge structure factor , showing a new enhanced small - momentum low - energy mode in electron doping . </S>",
    "<S> these facts indicate a possibility of detecting the new charge mode by rixs in electron - doped systems . </S>"
