    "as one of the very few lattice matched transition metal pairs one of which is ferromagnetic , fe - cr multilayers offer excellent opportunities for investigating the exchange coupling of fe layers through an antiferromagnetic cr spacer layer giving rise to the so - called giant - magnetoresistance ( gmr ) .",
    "applications as magnetic - field sensors , especially in reading information , sensing position / speed of moving parts , etc . have triggered intense research activity in these multilayers .",
    "gmr sensors are not only very sensitive but they can be made very small in size . for practical purposes not only",
    "does one need large gmr but also small saturation fields .",
    "the aim of the present work is to study the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity and magnetoresistance in gmr multilayer stacks prepared by ion - beam sputter deposition .",
    "typical multilayers reported here comprise 30 repeat layers of [ fe(20)/cr(10 ) ] that have been deposited by ion - beam sputter deposition onto si substrates with xenon ions at 900 v and a beam current of 20 ma .",
    "gmr in multilayers can be understood in terms of some simple ideas as follows . in zero magnetic field",
    "the ferromagnetic fe layers are coupled antiferromagnetically through the cr spacer layer giving rise to a high electrical resistance .",
    "this antiferromagnetic coupling is ascribed to the indirect exchange interaction between the fe layers through the oscillatory rkky interaction mediated by the conduction electrons .",
    "the above antiferromagnetic coupling between fe layers was established by means of light scattering from spin waves.@xcite as the external field increases , the spins in different fe layers align in the direction of the field producing a completely ferromagnetic alignment beyond a saturation field @xmath0 , reducing the resistance .",
    "thus we have a negative magnetoresistance ( mr ) .",
    "magnetoresistance is defined ( in text - book fashion ) by @xmath13 it is found in dc magnetron sputtered fe - cr superlattices@xcite that gmr oscillates as a function of cr spacer thickness with 3 gradually decreasing peaks centered at 11 , 27 and 42   cr for fe thickness of 32  .",
    "also the first antiferromagnetic region occurs between 6 and 11   cr for fe thickness lying between 15 and 40  .",
    "we have therefore chosen the cr thickness around 10   corresponding to the strongest peak of the antiferromagnetic coupling between the fe layers ( and hence the highest gmr ) .",
    "the basic qualitative features of gmr can be understood even in terms of bulk scattering only if the mean free path ( mfp ) of electrons within the layers is much larger than the layer thickness .",
    "if the mfp of the electrons is larger than the cr spacer thickness , the electrons can feel the relative orientation of the magnetization of the successive layers .",
    "however , this interplay between the successive magnetic layers disappears and the gmr vanishes if the mfp is less than the cr layer thickness .",
    "gmr is attributed to the spin - dependent conduction properties of ferromagnetic metals . in a ferromagnetic metal or alloy",
    "the electrical conduction takes place through independent channels by spin - up ( called majority ) and spin - down ( called minority ) electrons .",
    "this is the two - current model of fert and campbell@xcite whose physical basis is the dominance of the spin - conserving scattering and the weakness of the spin - flip collision , at least at low temperatures . in this picture",
    "all electrons of a given spin ( up or down ) with s or d or hybridized character are grouped together to form majority ( up ) or minority ( down ) bands .",
    "if one takes into account the details of the band structure of fe ( a weak ferromagnet ) and the simple drude conductivity formula for each band , it is easily shown@xcite that the majority band has a much higher conductivity than the minority band . as a result ,",
    "in the ferromagnetic alignment brought about by the saturation field ( @xmath0 ) , there is hardly any scattering for the majority band electrons since they remain majority in all the fe layers . on the other hand ,",
    "the minority band electrons get scattered within every fe layer .",
    "hence there is a short - circuiting effect , so to say , and the resistance ( @xmath14 ) drops in the ferromagnetic alignment .",
    "however , in the antiferromagnetic configuration ( zero - field ) both the majority and minority band electrons are scattered in successive layers , and there is no short - circuiting effect .",
    "therefore the resistance ( @xmath15 ) remains relatively high . a very simple calculation based on",
    "the two - current model shows that the gmr at low temperatures is given by ( considering only bulk scattering ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the resistivities of the minority and majority carriers , respectively .",
    "it turns out that interface scattering from imperfect interfaces , defects and impurities in fe - cr multilayers is also spin - dependent , and gives rise to the gmr . as a matter of fact , it is the imbalance between the resistivities of the two bands which is responsible for the gmr for bulk , interface and spin - flip scattering .",
    "the subject of gmr has been reviewed very well in a recent book.@xcite    considerable work has been reported on electrical transport and magnetic properties of fe - cr multilayers prepared by sputtering@xcite or molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe).@xcite the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity in [ fe(30)/cr(10 - 50)]@xmath19 multilayers , prepared by sputtering and mbe , was interpreted by almeida _",
    "et al._@xcite in terms of phonon - assisted s - s and s - d scattering in the temperature range of 15 - 300 k and in a saturation magnetic field of 7.5 koe .    in the antiferromagnetic fe - cr superlattice , made by dc magnetron sputtering , the temperature - dependent magnetoresistance ( defined as @xmath20 ) was found by mattson _ et al._@xcite to follow the equation for @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a constant of proportionality .",
    "this behaviour was explained in terms of thermal excitation of magnons whose occupation number ( @xmath24 ) @xmath25 ( at low temperatures ) for anisotropic materials@xcite and assuming @xmath26 .    in [ fe(12)/cr(12)]@xmath19 multilayers , prepared by mbe on mgo(100 )",

    "et al._@xcite among them are : + ( a ) the isothermal magnetoresistance , defined as @xmath27 $ ] , is proportional to @xmath9 in the parallel ( magnetic field in the plane of the multilayers ) orientation and to @xmath28 in the perpendicular case .",
    "+ ( b)a @xmath12 - @xmath0 phase diagram was obtained , which clearly indicated the transition between af and fm states .",
    "+ ( c ) as opposed to the work of mattson _ et al._@xcite ( which looked at the difference between the resistivity in the ideally antiferromagnetic ( @xmath29 ) and ferromagnetic ( @xmath30 ) alignments ) here@xcite the spin - dependent part of the electrical resistivity , defined as @xmath31 for fields @xmath32 ( where one has both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic fractions ) , is found to vary in a wide range of temperature below 100 k as @xmath33 where @xmath34 and the temperature exponent @xmath8 are functions of the magnetic field @xmath9 , and @xmath6 is a constant of proportionality .",
    "the constant @xmath8 was found@xcite to be @xmath35 for @xmath36 , @xmath37 for @xmath38 , and @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "this is in contrast to the value of @xmath41 for @xmath29 ( purely antiferromagnetic ) in the work of mattson",

    "+ ( d ) @xmath42 was found to vary linearly with temperature from 20 mk to about 1.5 k `` which could be due to electron scattering on critical thermal spin fluctuations''.@xcite    all the work summarized above is mostly on mbe grown fe - cr multilayers and those made by dc magnetron sputtering .",
    "although the present work is on fe - cr multilayers prepared by ion - beam sputter deposition , we do not believe that the underlying physics depends in any significant way on differences in these deposition techniques .",
    "fe - cr multilayers were prepared by ion - beam - sputtering technique and characterized by transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) , atomic force microscopy ( afm ) , auger electron spectroscopy ( aes ) , x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) , as well as resistivity , magnetic hysteresis loop and magnetotransport measurements .",
    "the film deposition procedure and film properties , including chemical composition , surface morphology , resistivity , saturation magnetization , coercive field , and magnetoresistance ratio , are discussed in detail in ref . [",
    "values of gmr ratios of the films are comparable to values measured for polycrystalline fe - cr films deposited by the more conventional rf sputtering technique.@xcite we have deposited the following fe - cr multilayer combinations : + si / cr(50)/[fe(20)/cr(t())]@xmath4330/cr(50-t (  ) ) , where @xmath44 was varied from 8 to 14 ; this range surrounds the first antiferromagnetic maximum in the fe - cr multilayer system .",
    "the deposition rates varied from 5 to 30  / min depending on the primary ion beam energy , the type of ions , and the target material .",
    "the films were deposited at room temerature .",
    "the effects of variations of the primary ion beam energy and the type of ions on gmr values were examined ; the investigated primary ion energy range was 700 - 1200 ev for ar ions and 900 - 1200 ev for xe ions .",
    "it was demonstrated that the gmr ratio is greater for films deposited using xe ions than for films deposited using ar ions , and that for both types of ions the gmr ratio increases as the primary ion beam energy decreases . in this investigation",
    "we report the work on fe - cr multilayers of typical structure [ fe(20)/cr(10)]@xmath4330 layers grown on si substrates using xe ion at 900 v and a beam current of 20 ma .",
    "the temperature dependence of the resistance between 5 and 300 k of the fe - cr multilayers was measured in zero as well as in some applied magnetic fields using the standard four - probe dc technique and a magnetic field ( 0 - 5.5 t ) provided by a quantum design squid magnetometer ( mpms ) . both the transport current and the applied field were in the plane of the film with the current parallel to the field . for measurements in magnetic fields perpendicular to the film plane we used a quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms ) .",
    "we used the same mpms to measure the magnetization of the fe - cr multilayers as a function of external fields at temperatures down to 2 k.",
    "figure 1 shows the magnetoresistance vs. external field @xmath9 ( koe ) for a typical xe - ion sputtered fe - cr multilayer sample at 10 and 300 k. the mr becomes constant at a saturation field @xmath0 ( vertical arrow ) around 13 koe with typical values of 21% at 10 k. these values compare favourably with 30% and 40% obtained in dc magnetron sputtered and mbe grown samples , respectively .",
    "hysteresis in the mr was negligible as the magnetic field was swept from @xmath45 koe .",
    "figure 2 shows the electrical resistivity @xmath46 vs. temperature @xmath47 for sample 1 at several values of the external magnetic field from 0 to 12 koe .",
    "the saturation field ( @xmath0 ) has a weak temperature dependence , namely , it decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "this is clear from the @xmath48 curves , say , at 10 and 12 koe .",
    "they are closer to each other at higher temperatures .",
    "to interpret the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity , @xmath48 , at an intermediate field between @xmath29 and @xmath30 is not simple . in this magnetic field region",
    "the material has both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic fractions .",
    "instead , for @xmath49 , the alignment of the spins of each fe layer is parallel to the direction of the external field giving rise to a fully ferromagnetic state .",
    "it is well known in crystalline bulk 3d metals and alloys that the electron - phonon scattering contribution to the electrical resistivity from @xmath50 dominates over @xmath51 due to the overlap of the s and d bands at the fermi level .",
    "specifically , for fe the density of states of the 3d@xmath52 majority band at the fermi level is rather large compared to those of the s bands .",
    "the resistivity , @xmath50 , is given by the bloch - wilson formula.@xcite the  spin - disorder resistivity \" coming from the electron - magnon ( spin - wave contribution ) scattering is well described@xcite by a relatively small term varying as @xmath53 in ferromagnets like fe , co , and ni . putting all these contributions together along with the residual resistivity @xmath54 one can write , assuming mathiessen s rule @xmath55 where the second term is the bloch - wilson contribution @xmath50 and the third term is the small electron - magnon contribution increasing with temperature due to thermal excitation of magnons .    taking the debye temperature @xmath56 k for fe - cr multilayers@xcite",

    "5 ) using a 3-parameter least - squares fit program which also evaluated the integral numerically at each iteration .",
    "excellent fits were obtained for all the samples with correlation coefficients of 0.999995 and values of the normalized @xmath57 consistent with the number of degrees of freedom and error estimates .",
    "figure 3 shows @xmath58 vs. @xmath12 data ( points ) for three samples from 5 to 300 k at their respective @xmath0 .",
    "the solid lines are the best - fit curves to eq .",
    "it is found that the value of the coefficient of the magnetic scattering term , @xmath59 , averaged over all the 5 samples is @xmath60 cm k@xmath61 compared to @xmath62 cm k@xmath61 in bulk ferromagnets ( fe , co , ni ) .",
    "this higher value of @xmath59 may be related to the fact that the resistivity of these fe - cr multilayers at 300 k is about five times larger than that of bulk iron .",
    "the fits of the data of fig . 3 to eq . ( 5 ) without the magnetic @xmath63 term are distinctly inferior to those with the magnetic term .",
    "the values of @xmath57 are typically 6 times larger and the correlation coefficients poorer for the fits without the magnetic term .",
    "the deviation of the actual data from the best - fit values ( residuals ) is plotted in fig .",
    "4 as a function of temperature for sample 2 for both the fits .",
    "the deviation is much less ( @xmath64 cm in @xmath65 cm ) and more random for the fits with the magnetic term than without it .",
    "addition of a bloch - grneissen ( bg ) term ( @xmath51 ) , which has a @xmath66 dependence , or replacing the bloch - wilson term by the bg term makes the fit much worse .      at @xmath29 these multilayers are ideally in an antiferromagnetic state where the neighbouring ferromagnetic fe layers are all antiferromagnetically coupled resulting in a higher resistivity .",
    "actually there may be pinholes through the cr spacer layer directly coupling the fe layers ferromagnetically instead .",
    "let us define an antiferromagnetic fraction ( aff ) as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the magnetization measured at @xmath30 and @xmath69 is the magnetization when the field is reduced from saturation to @xmath9 , all at 5 k. our @xmath69 measurements on these samples show that the aff is typically 80% at @xmath29 .",
    "as @xmath9 is increased the fe layers gradually turn their magnetization in the direction of the external field reducing the aff and hence the resistivity .",
    "finally the aff reduces to zero ( fully ferromagnetic alignment ) and the resistivity and hence the gmr saturates at @xmath30 .",
    "we define @xmath70 as the difference in resistivity at a given temperature @xmath12 between the af @xmath71 and the fm @xmath72 states , both assumed ideal .",
    "this @xmath73 is primarily due to the additional spin - dependent scattering ( both bulk and interface ) in the antiferromagnetic ( af ) state .",
    "it is assumed here that the residual resistivity and the interband s - d scattering ( dominant for 3d metals and alloys ) do not depend strongly on magnetic fields .",
    "figure 5 plots @xmath73 vs. @xmath12 data ( stars ) for samples 1 and 3 .",
    "thus the additional spin - dependent scattering ( resistivity ) in the af state decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "just like the magnetic field aligns the spins in different fe layers reducing the aff ( gradually bringing ferromagnetic order in its place ) and produces a negative magnetoresistance , here temperature reduces the antiferromagnetic order ( potentially bringing down the aff ) and hence @xmath73 .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "5 that @xmath74 varies as @xmath53 at low temperatures and is roughly linear at higher temperatures .",
    "singh _ et al._@xcite had worked out the reduction in antiferromagnetic order due to thermal excitation of spin waves in highly anisotropic antiferromagnets with weak interlayer coupling between the antiferromagnetic planes .",
    "this theory has been extended in the present case where each fe layer is ferromagnetic but coupled antiferromagnetically to the neighbouring fe layers due to the rkky interaction . in terms of the planar and interlayer exchange energies @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively , the sublattice magnetization @xmath1 at temperature @xmath12 is given in the appendix ( eq .",
    "assuming @xmath77 , we have the relation @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",

    "we note that this expression is relatively unchanged when ferromagnetic domains are included .",
    "we numerically evaluated the integral in eq .",
    "( 7 ) and used a three parameter least squares fit program to fit the data of fig .",
    "5 . the resulting best - fit curves , shown by solid lines in fig . 5 , yield values of @xmath86 consistent with the experimental errors and a correlation coefficient of 0.9999 .",
    "estimates of @xmath75 and @xmath76 are found from the above fits .",
    "they are @xmath87 k and @xmath88 k , respectively .",
    "the value for @xmath75 is well below the curie temperature ( 1040 k ) for bulk iron but could be closer to the unknown curie temperature of @xmath89 thick fe films sandwiched between cr spacer layers . the value for @xmath76 is however satisfying , close to the recently identified glass temperature , @xmath90=140 k , of an antiferromagnetic glassy phase that coexists with gmr in similar multilayer films .",
    "irreversibilities in this glassy phase have been shown to arise from the same interlayer coupling that drives the antiparalllel alignments in gmr.@xcite    consistent with the above model are experimental data taken by us ( not shown ) and others@xcite in which the saturation fields are studied as a function of spacer layer thickness . for three ion - beam",
    "sputter deposited 10-layer samples of fe(20)/cr(@xmath91 ) with different cr spacer layer thickness ( @xmath91 ) we have observed that as @xmath91 increases from 8 to 12 , the saturation field @xmath92 decreases from 10 to 5 koe",

    "et al._@xcite ( summarized at the end of introduction and fig . 3 of ref .",
    "[ 8 ] ) for mbe grown samples .",
    "however , we find some differences , like @xmath8 in our work is typically 2 for @xmath98 , becoming @xmath39 for @xmath99 and decreasing at still higher fields .",
    "this implies that @xmath100 vs. @xmath12 curves ( fig .",
    "6 ) are quadratic in lower fields and linear around @xmath99 instead of @xmath39 as in the work of aliev _",
    "al._@xcite    it is found from fig . 6",
    "that the intercept @xmath7 decreases with increasing applied fields .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that the antiferromagnetic fraction ( aff ) decreases with increasing field . if we plot @xmath7 as a function of our measured values of aff ( % ) for samples 1 and 3 we find , as shown in fig .",
    "8 , that @xmath7 increases with the aff in a monotonic fashion ( both decreasing with @xmath9 ) .",
    "this is a logical conclusion since as @xmath101 , the aff attains its maximum value giving the highest resistivity in the ideally af ground state .",
    "it is to be noted that the decrease of @xmath7 with @xmath9 and the decrease of @xmath74 with @xmath12 ( fig .",
    "5 ) have a common origin .",
    "it is the decrease of the aff brought about by @xmath9 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "figure 9 shows the low - field magnetoresistance of sample 4 ( argon - ion sputtered ) vs. external field @xmath9 for the parallel orientation ( @xmath9 in the film plane ) .",
    "it is amply clear that the mr @xmath102 in contrast to the findings of aliev _ et al._@xcite ( fig .",
    "1(a ) of ref .",
    "[ 8 ] ) who found that the mr is linear in @xmath9 for their mbe grown samples .",
    "we found no linear region in the mr vs. @xmath9 curve even at higher fields until the saturation field ( @xmath0 ) of 2 - 3 koe was reached .",
    "as a matter of fact sample 4 ( fig .",
    "9 ) reflects an s - shaped curve having points of inflection .",
    "however , for the perpendicular orientation ( @xmath9 perpendicular to the film plane ) we find that the mr again goes as @xmath28 in agreement with the findings of aliev _",
    "et al._@xcite    the observed @xmath28 dependence at low external fields is , in fact , expected from simple energy considerations , as argued below .",
    "the antiferromagnetic ground state of the multilayer is characterized by the sublattice magnetization @xmath103 , which takes into account the antiparallel orientation of the spin polarization in alternating fe layers a and b. the direction of @xmath104 is arbitrary in the ideal isotropic situation . when a small in - plane magnetic field is applied , the sublattice magnetization @xmath104 aligns itself perpendicular to the direction of the field .",
    "this is the lowest - energy configuration as it allows for energy gain in all fe layers due to twisting of spins in the field direction .",
    "if the twist angle is @xmath105 , assumed small , then the energy gain is @xmath106 .",
    "the twisting also costs energy @xmath107 due to loss of antiferromagnetic exchange energy at the layer interfaces . minimizing the net energy change yields the optimum twist angle , @xmath108 , as proportional to the field .",
    "now the reduction in the sublattice magnetization or the antiferromagnetic fraction ( aff ) , and therefore the decrease in resistivity , due to this twist is @xmath109 , which goes as @xmath110 for low fields .",

    "the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity and magnetoresistance has been studied in ion - beam sputtered fe - cr multilayers .",

    "this gives rise to a high resistance .",
    "an external magnetic field aligns the spins in different fe layers producing a ferromagnetic alignment beyond h@xmath115 which reduces the electrical resistance . the electrical resistivity in the fully ferromagnetic state ( @xmath30 ) between 5 and 300 k has been interpreted as the sum of a residual resistivity , electron - phonon s - d scattering and spin - disorder resistivity ( eq.(5 ) ) .",
