    "the x - ray transient grs  1915 + 105 , discovered in 1992 by the _ granat satellite , @xcite , is one of a few galactic sources exhibiting superluminal radio ejecta ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this microquasar offers a nearby laboratory for the study of black hole accretion , and the associated phenomena of jet formation , collimation , and outflow . since the characteristic evolution time is proportional to the mass of the central black hole ( rees , 1998",
    "; sams et al . 1996 )",
    ", microquasars can reveal in minutes a richness of phenomena analogous to a 10@xmath9  m@xmath10 quasar observed over centuries .",
    "_    in this paper , we present radio images of the microquasar grs  1915 + 105 , made with the very long baseline array ( vlba , see @xcite ) , in two distinct states of the black hole binary , the * plateau * and * flare * states .",
    "the * plateau * state is characterized by a flat radio spectrum , compact size of a few au , and flux density 10 - 100  mjy .",
    "the xte ( 2 - 12  kev ) soft x - rays are weak , and the batse ( 20 - 100  kev ) emission is strong . in contrast , during the * flare * state , with rise - time @xmath51  day , optically thin ejecta of up to 1  jy at @xmath1113  cm ( s@xmath12 ) , are expelled to thousands of au and fade over several days .",
    "the soft x - rays also flare and show extreme variability , while the hard x - rays fade for a few days before recovering .",
    "observations over a range of wavelengths ( 13  cm , 3.6  cm , 2  cm and 0.7  cm ) , distinguish the intrinsically elongated nucleus , of length @xmath010@xmath1  au , from angular broadening due to scattering by the line - of - sight ionized interstellar medium in the galactic plane .",
    "grs  1915 + 105 was also imaged in its distinct state of pronounced x - ray dips , that repeat on timescales ranging from @xmath012 - 60  min , with the same repetition rate seen in the ir and radio pulses .",
    "the radio and x - ray variability of grs  1915 + 105 showed early evidence for recurrent accretion and jet formation @xcite .",
    "there now exists a wealth of data from x - ray , ir and radio observations , offering clues to the coupled evolution of accretion disk , corona , and jet . on several occasions ,",
    "the flux of thermal x - rays from the inner accretion disk has been observed to diminish , with simultaneous hardening of the power - law spectrum from relativistic electrons , followed by progressively delayed emission in the ir and radio , @xcite .",
    "one scenario is to have the inner part of the accretion disk and corona accelerated to relativistic speeds , and ejected as synchrotron - emitting plasma . alternatively , advective infall of the disk past the black hole horizon @xcite , could account for the x - ray dips , but not for the ir and radio emission . a solution allowing simultaneous inflow and outflow is presented in the ` adios ' ( advection dominated inflow - outflow solution ) model of @xcite , but mechanisms to produce the observed x - ray variability without adaf ( advection dominated advection flow ) are discussed in @xcite .",
    "though the mechanism is still debated , this particular source switches the jets on and off , presenting repeated but unpredictable opportunities to observe the ejecta evolve from scales of a few to thousands of au .",
    "triggered by gbi  daily monitoring , we have coordinated observations with x - ray and ir telescopes , followed the radio variations with the vla @xcite , and imaged the radio emission at multiple wavelengths with the vlba ( this paper ) .",
    "crucial capabilities of the vlba were the dynamic scheduling in response to transients , and phase - referencing which permits astrometry and the detection of weak sources .",
    "the vlba observation epochs and parameters are presented in table-1 .",
    "observations are possible in any of nine wavelength bands , with band changes requiring 20  s or less .",
    "simultaneous data can be obtained from the 3.6  cm/13  cm receiver pair , by means of frequency - selective optics .",
    "the choice of band was made just before each observation , based on the most recent flux and spectral information .",
    "observations at 2  cm and 7  mm are least affected by galactic electron scattering , and were used to observe the au scales when the radio - to - ir spectrum was flat . during the steep - spectrum flares , we employed the 3.6  cm/13  cm pair to image large - scale ejecta .",
    "other bands were observed for @xmath020 - 40  mins in rotation .",
    "we employed the highest data recording rates , ( 256 or 128  mb  s@xmath7 , subject to scheduling constraints ) , for maximum sensitivity in short time , since the source is known to be highly variable . ultimately , our image quality is limited not by thermal noise , but by the restriction of instantaneous uv coverage to a maximum of 45 baselines ( fourier components ) from 10 antennas .    all the vlba observations ( except 7  mm )",
    "were phase - referenced , i.e. , the antennas alternated between the target and one of several extragalactic calibrators of known ( sub - millarcsec ) position .",
    "cycle times of three minutes were adequately fast to follow tropospheric phase fluctuations at 2  cm and longer wavelengths . thus the interferometer array was rendered coherent for many hours , and the resulting astrometric accuracy of @xmath01.5  mas allows us to discriminate between moving and fixed source components .",
    "in addition , with frequent amplitude calibration , we avoid blind self - calibration on the time - variable target .",
    "we generated time - resolved images , with snap - shot intervals ranging from 5 to 60  mins , depending on the beam size .",
    "self - calibration was used self - consistently , i.e. only over the snapshot interval .",
    "snap - shots were averaged in the image plane and uv data were combined over longer intervals only if the snapshots were indistinguishable . in practice , there is little effect at lower resolutions from the moving ejecta - mainly a blurring of the moving component , and an increase in residual artifacts , since self - calibration does not work perfectly if the structure is varying .",

    "[ fig-5 ] ) , the problem of reliable imaging is more severe .",
    "in addition to snapshot imaging , a careful search for time - variable or moving structure was done by examining and model fitting to the closure phases over intervals as short as 5  mins . simultaneous flux measurement ( from the vla or gbi , when available ) was used to constrain the total flux while modelling the au - scale structure .",
    "no evidence for rapidly moving or variable structures was found .",
    "we can rule out discrete , moving ejecta on au scales - none of the snapshots or closure phases showed , e.g. double sources or differently oriented structures .",
    "we can not at this time rule out fast - moving features with low contrast , that would be blurred out .",
    "the simulations can be used to place limits on the artifacts due to the technique , to be discussed in a future paper .",

    "the au - scale structure is smooth , with little evidence for discrete , moving ejecta .",

    "a static structure is unlikely , given that we see superluminally moving ejecta on larger scales _ during the same event . _",
    "a more likely explanation is a steady state with fast , continuous flow and adiabatic losses which cause the jet to fade rapidly with distance .",
    "the travel - time along the length of the jet ( @xmath010  au  hr@xmath7 ) at relativistic speed is comparable to the adiabatic loss timescale ( @xmath030  min ) over which new ir / radio emission fades away after each x - ray injection event .",
    "analogous compact jets may be found in cygnus x-1 and cygnus x-3 , as suggested by @xcite from the flat radio - millimeter spectra of the cores in these x - ray binaries .",
    "good evidence exists that the synchrotron spectrum extends up to 2@xmath23 in the ir @xcite .",

    "this rotation of position angle with size scale appears real .",
    "we suspect it could be due to opacity effects in a conical jet , since the high resolution is obtained at shorter wavelengths - however we do not have a clear explanation for it .    in summary ,",
    "a synchrotron jet ( see also discussion ) accounts in a unified , consistent way for the following phenomena :    * the flat radio spectrum and high brightness temperature . *",
    "the elongation of the core along the axis of arcsecond - scale superluminal ejecta , ( @xmath0155@xmath6 ) . *",
    "the peak emission is progressively delayed at longer wavelengths , as they emanate from further along the expanding jet ; * there is progressively less variation of the flux at longer wavelengths , due to convolution over a larger region ; * the decay time of flux variations is consistent with the travel time of relativistic plasma along the jet .",
    "however , we must point out that the ratio of integrated flux density of approaching to receding parts of the continuous jet are only 1.15@xmath40.04 , 1.20@xmath40.05 , and 1.10@xmath40.08 , for the three images of fig .",

    "snapshots taken a few hours apart allow us to measure , for the approaching ejection , a velocity of 1.28@xmath40.07  c  @xmath50 at 500 to 600  au away from the nucleus , consistent with the velocity of @xcite at 5000  au for the same event .",
    "this implies ballistic motion from 500  au to 5000  au .",
    "phase - referencing clearly distinguishes the stationary core from the moving ejecta , unlike previous observations .",
    "next , back - extrapolation of the position of the ejecta ( over 2 - 3 days ) , using the velocity measured over a few hours , gives a position coincident with the core at the start time of the flares .",
    "thus , on average , this is consistent with ballistic motion from the few - au scale outwards .",
    "the lateral expansion rate of the ejecta is about 0.14 - 0.2c , and is not well constrained in the vlba images due to the lack of sensitivity to extended structure .",
    "the value of 0.2  c was measured in the vla images on larger scales , @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss a possible thermal origin for the emission , and decide in favor of a synchrotron jet .",
    "we also find good consistency between the synchrotron model of @xcite and the disk instability model of @xcite for the source of the relativistic plasma in the baby jets .",
    "the large ejecta require @xmath010 times more mass , and may be qualitatively different from the au - scale jets as well .",
    "we rule out a thermal origin for the emission in favor of a synchrotron jet by the following argument .",
    "if we assume that the radio emission is due to free - free ( thermal ) radiation from gas with an electron temperature of @xmath010@xmath51k , and follow the formulation of reynolds ( 1986 ) for the mass loss rate in a thermal jet , we roughly estimate    @xmath52    where v is the velocity of the outflowing gas . if this velocity were of the order of the speed of sound in a gas of 10@xmath51k , v=10@xmath49  km  s@xmath7 , then a mass loss rate of @xmath04x10@xmath53m@xmath10  yr@xmath7 , a mechanical power of 3@xmath5410@xmath55 , and an x - ray luminosity of the jet of @xmath56 are derived .",
    "these powers are similar to the eddington luminosity of a @xmath57 black hole , and appear excessive for what is known of grs  1915 + 105 .    finally , the qpo s observed in the radio and x - rays suggest that the material is travelling and expanding at relativistic speeds .",
    "this would make the estimated mechanical power and x - ray luminosity of the jet increase by a further large factor .",
    "we hence favour the synchrotron emission mechanism for the au - scale jet .      a jet model with minimum free parameters",
    "is discussed in @xcite .",
    "considering the coupled disk - jet system , subject to the assumption of total equipartition of energy between disk , jet kinetic energy , jet internal energy ( thermal energy of proton / electron plasma ) and magnetic field , expanding freely into vacuum , they derive a relativistic jet of terminal @xmath580.96 .",
    "( a higher velocity would require acceleration by a mechanism other than pressure gradient . )",
    "the only free parameter is the measured disk x - ray luminosity . in the case of grs  1915 + 105 , with x - ray luminosity of 10@xmath59  erg  s@xmath7 , (",
    "0.3 to 3 times this have been observed ) the following properties are expected for the jet at 2  cm .",
    "the mechanical power of the jet is of the order of q@xmath60=10@xmath59  erg  s@xmath7 , which indicates a mass accretion rate of 10@xmath61  g  s@xmath7 , assuming a conversion efficiency of 10% from gravitational energy .",
    "note that this model assumes a maximally efficient radio jet for a given disk luminosity , i.e. a radio - loud jet .",
    "this implies , as pointed out in @xcite , that 10@xmath59  erg  s@xmath7 is a * lower limit * to the mechanical power of the jet .",
    "the model then predicts a ( steady state ) flux density of about 20  mjy , and jet length of about 0.4  mas , with expected wavelength dependence of jet size @xmath62 , and spectrum s@xmath63 .",
    "other derived parameters are a magnetic field b of 0.4  gauss at 10  au from the black hole , and an electron lorentz factor @xmath64 in the range of 200 - 800 .    thus , in the steady state",
    ", the model yields roughly the correct size , spectrum , and flux of the au - scale nuclear jet .",
    "time variable jet length and flux density , can perhaps be accomodated as changes in mass accretion rate . allowing for the complex time - variability in this system , we judge the agreement with our observations to be satisfactory .",
    "next , given that the jet is already maximally radio loud , it seems to us necessary to invoke an additional mechanism , to explain the transient release of excess synchrotron emission in the flares , with spectrum s@xmath12 .",
    "the dependence of flux density on orientation , ( as in agn unification schemes ) , does not apply here since we observe the axis position angle does not change sufficiently from small to large scales .",
    "grs  1915 + 105 shows extremely complex behavior in x - rays , see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig-10 ] , and @xcite .",
    "the x - ray variability is explained by @xcite , and @xcite , in terms of the evacuation and refilling of the inner hot accretion disk due to thermal - viscous instability .",
    "they attempt to reduce the complexity of the light curve to essentially one parameter , the radius of the missing inner disk .",
    "the light curve , and hardness ratio variations , are decomposed into a superposition of an inner , 2.2  kev disk component , of variable radius ( @xmath020 - 100  km ) , along with an outer constant disk of radius over 300  km and temperature 0.5  kev .",
    "the instability ( emptying / refilling of the disk ) occurs in the region where radiation pressure dominates the gas pressure .",
    "the time required to refill the disk with x - ray emitting gas is set by the viscous / thermal timescale .",
    "assuming a viscocity parameter @xmath650.01 , they estimate this timescale as    @xmath66    for the 30  min dips in the x - rays ( the timescale of the radio oscillations ) the radius of the missing disk is of the order of 180  km . from spectral fitting to the disk / black body",
    ", they also derive a mass accretion rate of @xmath010@xmath67 to @xmath010@xmath68 g  s@xmath7 , depending on whether the black hole is maximally rotating or not .",
    "the highest accretion rates are inversely correlated with the x - ray luminosity , which they take as evidence that the majority of the mass may be eliminated from view by an adaf - type flow into the black hole .    from our au - scale images",
    ", we find good agreement between the mass of synchrotron - emitting plasma in the au - scale ` mini - jet ' , and the mass loss from the missing radius of the inner accretion disk .",
    "the timescales and radio / soft x - ray correlations are consistent with the disk instability model . in contrast , the large flares eject an order of magnitude more mass , and the recovery timescale of @xmath018  hrs indicates a radius of @xmath0600  km for the missing disk .",
    "this is so large as to lie outside the radiation- pressure dominated region , so the instability ( oscillation ) would not work .",
    "indeed , the large - scale events never repeat , unlike the au - scale 30  min cycles . once again",
    ", we take this as evidence of a qualitative difference between the au - scale emission and the extreme ejections during flares",
    ". thus the belloni model works for mini - jets , but not for large flares .",
    "from vlba images of grs  1915 + 105 in 1997 and 1998 we conclude the following :    1 .   the core is always resolved as a compact collimated jet of @xmath010@xmath11@xmath69  au , that has a peak brightness temperature t@xmath210@xmath70k .",
    "the compact jet is observed in the * plateau * state that can last from days up to several months , which consists of a steady flat spectrum at radio wavelengths , persistently bright hard x - ray ( 20 - 100  kev ) flux , and a faint flux in the softer x - rays ( 2 - 12  kev ) ( see figs .",
    "[ fig-1 ] & [ fig-2 ] and figs .",
    "[ fig-4 ] & [ fig-5 ] ) .",
    "the compact jet is observed a few hours before and a few hours after major flare / ejection events ( figs .",
    "[ fig-2 ] & [ fig-5 ] ) .",
    "the nuclear jet is re - established in @xmath3818 hours after a major outburst . in minor outbursts",
    "the jet flux varies in @xmath030  min ( figs .",
    "[ fig-9 ] & [ fig-10 ] ) , with the same period seen in the infrared and in the 2 - 12  kev x - rays , ( e.g. mirabel et al .",
    "1998 ; fender et al .",
    "1998 ; eikenberry et al . 1998 ) .",
    "4 .   although we could not measure the proper motion of matter in the quasi - steady compact jet , its length of @xmath020  au ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig-5]d & e ) is comparable to the distance that would be traversed at relativistic speed during the time - scale of the oscillations ( @xmath030  min ) .",
    "the compact jet is optically thick synchrotron emission .",
    "this is suggested by the high degree of collimation , the high brightness temperature , the flat radio spectrum , and the inferred relativistic bulk motions . the mass outflow assuming a synchrotron jet is @xmath2510@xmath71m@xmath10  yr@xmath7 , consistent with the accretion rate estimated from the x - ray luminosity of the black hole binary .",
    "thermal processes alone can not account for the radio emission because they are relatively inefficient radiative mechanisms that would require an accretion rate * greater * than 10@xmath72  m@xmath10  yr@xmath7 , which is unreasonably large .",
    "the large mass ejection events with measured superluminal velocities take place at the time of abrupt changes in the x - ray state of the source . within @xmath45@xmath6",
    "the same position angles were observed for major ejections in 1994 - 1996 @xcite , and 1997 - 1998 ( this paper ) . the change from radio - quiet to radio - loud states can not be caused by change in orientation , since the position angle of the ejecta does not change sufficiently from small to large scales .",
    "the axis of the ejecta at large scales ( @xmath25500  au ) appear to be rotated clockwise by @xmath512@xmath6 relative to the jet axis at @xmath38100  au , both measured at the same time .",
    "the flux variations must be intrinsic . 7 .",
    "time - lapse images allow us to detect the motions of the large - scale ejecta within a few hours , with apparent speeds of @xmath251.3  c , consistent with previous observations ( mirabel & rodrguez , 1999 ) . knowing the time for the onset of the radio outburst , it is inferred that the acceleration to terminal speeds must take place within 500  au of the black hole .",
    "8 .   by astrometry over two years relative to an extragalactic reference , we locate the black hole binary within @xmath01.5  mas , and follow its secular parallax due to galactic rotation . the black hole is stationary on the sky to @xmath5100  km  s@xmath7 , once the secular parallax is accounted for .",
