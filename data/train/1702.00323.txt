    "the first member of the transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmdc ) to be established as a direct gap semiconductor in monolayer ( ml ) form was mos@xmath0 @xcite , which has resulted in a global research effort exploring this promising 2d semiconductor family @xcite .",
    "first proto - type device applications such as transistors @xcite and light emitters @xcite have shown the promise of this atomically thin materials for electronics and optoelectronics .",
    "another motivation for research into mos@xmath0 is the high natural abundance of the naturally occurring mineral molybdenite @xcite . because of their apparent superior optical quality as compared to ml mos@xmath0 , recent research on layered tmdc materials with emphasis on challenging experiments in valleytronics and",

    "the linewidth of @xmath3 mev is even smaller than a previously reported value of the homogeneous linewidth in ml mos@xmath0 on sio@xmath0 substrates ( 4.5  mev ) measured with four wave mixing @xcite . in temperature dependent experiments we measure the broadening of the optical transition linewidth due to interactions with acoustic and optical phonons .",
    "the proximity of the @xmath4-point close in energy to the valence band maximum at the @xmath5-point in mos@xmath0 @xcite might be at the origin of the strong broadening observed when approaching room temperature . +",
    "( 2 ) remarkably , the emission linewidth and intensity in our hbn / ml mos@xmath0 / hbn structures are unchanged following several cool - down cycles to t=4  k and exposure to laser radiation .",
    "this is in contrast to the variable optical response of uncapped mos@xmath0 @xcite and ws@xmath0 @xcite mls exfoliated onto si / sio@xmath0 substrates , which often depends also on cool - down procedure and sample history .",
    "reproducibility and stability are essential to better understand the unusual optical properties of these materials @xcite and to prepare possible device applications .",
    "we observe these narrow transition lines in different ml mos@xmath0 samples exfoliated from different bulk material ( i ) grown by chemical vapor transport ( cvt , see sec.[apendix ] ) and ( ii ) commercially available crystals .",
    "+ ( 3 ) the narrow linewidth allows us to distinguish spectrally the emission from the non - identical valleys @xmath6 and @xmath7 as they are split by the valley zeeman effect @xcite .",
    "we are able to determine the longitudinal exciton land g - factor in magnetic fields below 10  t in a commercial magneto - cryostat . due to the large linewidth of uncapped samples , this measurement was so far only possible in pulsed field facilities generating several tens of tesla @xcite .",

    "we also show the _ generation _ and _ rotation _ of robust valley coherence , a coherent superposition of valley states using the chiral optical selection rules @xcite , an important step towards full optical control of valley states in these 2d materials @xcite .",
    "the photoluminescence ( pl ) spectrum at low temperature of mos@xmath0 mls encapsulated in hbn exhibits a very narrow neutral exciton emission ( x@xmath10 ) at energies between @xmath11 ev with a linewidth ( fwhm ) varying between @xmath3 and @xmath12 mev depending on the sample used and the detection spot position , where the detection spot diameter is @xmath13 m ( see sect .",
    "the low - temperature linewidth in our capped samples is more than one order of magnitude smaller than the one observed for the usual broad peak reported in most studies @xcite .",
    "this transition usually attributed to the neutral exciton , is possibly merged with a broad charged exciton and/or defect contribution , as discussed recently @xcite .",
    "the pl and reflectivity fwhm measured here is for certain samples smaller than the homogeneous linewidth extracted by means of four wave mixing techniques for mls on sio@xmath0 @xcite . for comparison , pl and reflectivity give neutral exciton linewidth down to 4  mev in hbn encapsulated wse@xmath0 mls @xcite . +",
    "a typical pl emission spectrum of a capped sample is shown in fig.[fig : fig1]b ( filled curve ) under a 50 @xmath14w cw laser excitation at 2.33 ev . the neutral exciton emission , identified by polarization - resolved experiments ( shown later in sec.[valleypol ] ) , corresponds to the main feature observed in the differential reflectivity spectrum in the same figure .",
    "+ note that almost no signature of charged excitons or defect - related emission is observed in these mls .",
    "in contrast , the typical spectrum of a mos@xmath0 ml deposited directly onto the sio@xmath0 substrate ( black curve ) exhibits a very large and broad defect - related emission followed by charged exciton ( trion ) emission ( fwhm 38 mev ) and a neutral exciton emission ( fwhm 16 mev ) @xcite whose intensity drops dramatically after a few minutes of laser exposure due to laser - induced doping of these mls @xcite ( here , the spectrum was recorded within the first 0.5 seconds following laser exposure ) . the intensity stemming from the neutral exciton in our hbn - protected samples is at least one order of magnitude higher than in unprotected ones , for a fully quantitative comparison cavity effects need to be taken into account @xcite .",
    "+ important for reproducibility , no evolution or hysteresis of the pl spectrum was observed even after several minutes of exposure to @xmath15 @xmath14w excitation and after several temperature cycles @xmath16  k. these results demonstrate that capping the mls with hbn allows to address the intrinsic high optical quality of these 2d crystals , and protects them from possible charge transfers and local electric field fluctuations coming from the substrate .",
    "the layer of hbn below mos@xmath0 acts as a spacer so that the surface roughness of sio@xmath0 is not transferred to the ml @xcite .",
    "this also suggests that for certain applications no acid treatment of the surface is needed if the freshly exfoliated sample is capped immediately with hbn @xcite .",
    "note that the neutral exciton x@xmath10 line is redshifted by 20 to 30  mev in capped samples with respect to unprotected ones ( typically found at @xmath17 ev @xcite ) .",
    "this was also observed in capped wse@xmath0 mls @xcite , and may be due to a different dielectric environment when the ml is capped with hbn @xcite or to a different strain when the mls are not directly in contact with the sio@xmath0 substrate . in recent studies addressing this problem in ml wse@xmath0 it has been suggested that this small red shift of the emission is the result of two substantial shifts compensating each other @xcite : the exciton binding energy @xmath18 considerably decreases , but the free carrier bandgap @xmath19 as well , which results in a very small shift of the optical bandgap @xmath20 , which is the neutral exciton emission energy .      figure [ fig : fig1]c shows the pl spectrum of an encapsulated sample for selected temperatures , revealing a blueshift of @xmath21 mev and a narrowing by a factor of 10 for the neutral exciton emission when cooling down the sample from 300 to 4  k. the inset is a colormap showing the evolution of the pl intensity as a function of temperature for a fixed low laser power of @xmath22w at @xmath23 ev .",
    "when going from room temperature to @xmath24  k , the intensity increases significantly and the linewidth narrows down to only a few mev .",
    "in addition to the reduction of non - radiative recombination on defects , the overall , not monotonous increase in intensity when reaching low temperature may be due to a competition between bright and dark excitonic states and possibly indicates that ml mos@xmath0 belongs to the bright family as ml mose@xmath0 .",
    "several theoretical calculations have predicted that the lowest excitonic transition in mos@xmath0 mls should be bright @xcite , but this is still debated since the opposite configuration has also been predicted @xcite . here",
    "charge tunable samples @xcite or experiments in transverse magnetic fields @xcite are expected to give a better indication on the dark - bright order in future experiments on these narrow linewidth samples .",
    "+ the temperature dependence of the pl peak position follows a standard hyperbolic cotangent relation @xcite : @xmath25 \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the optical bandgap at zero temperature , @xmath27 is a dimensionless coupling constant , @xmath28 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath29 is an average phonon energy . the fitted curve ( solid line shown in the inset of fig.[fig : fig1]c ) yields @xmath30 ev , @xmath31 and @xmath32  mev .",
    "the coupling constant and the average phonon energy are similar to those reported previously in the literature for the tmdc ml family @xcite . the evolution of the linewidth as a function of temperature is shown in panel d of fig.[fig : fig1 ] , and it can be seen that it decreases by more than one order of magnitude when passing from room to cryogenic temperatures , which is a signature of an efficient coupling with phonons .",
    "the evolution of the linewidth can be phenomenologically approximated by a phonon - induced broadening @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34  mev and @xmath35ev/@xmath36 describes the linear increase due to acoustic phonons , and is of the same order of magnitude than the one reported in refs.@xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath37  mev is a measure of the strength of the phonon - coupling and @xmath38  mev is the _ averaged _ energy of the relevant phonons , that we obtained by fitting the optical bandgap energy shift with eq.([eq1 ] ) for consistency .",
    "note that the value of @xmath39 mev found here is larger than the @xmath40 mev and @xmath41 mev previously reported for ws@xmath0 and mose@xmath0 mls , respectively @xcite , but so far no detailed discussion exists on mos@xmath0 mls since the optical transition linewidth in uncapped samples is too broad .",
    "this larger coupling with optical phonons may be a consequence of the energy - proximity between the local maximum of the valence band at @xmath4 and the absolute maxima at the @xmath5 valleys in mos@xmath0 mls @xcite .",
    "+ in order to exclude any possible problems due to localization effects on the linewidth evolution at low temperatures , we have performed reflectivity measurements in addition to pl as a function of temperature .",
    "the first derivative of the differential reflectivity for selected temperatures is shown in fig.[fig : fig1]f , and also exhibits a very small linewidth of @xmath42 mev which broadens roughly linearly as a function of temperature up to 100 k , as shown in fig.[fig : fig1]e .",
    "a linear fit gives a slope of @xmath43ev / k , similar to the @xmath44ev / k observed for the pl linewidth .",
    "since reflectivity is sensitive to transitions with a large density of states @xcite i.e. free excitons , we conclude from the very similar temperature dependence that the pl also stems dominantly from free neutral excitons .",
    "due to sample inhomogeneity the exciton energy fluctuates by a few mev for different points on the sample , we found a maximum energy difference for the exciton pl energy of 10 mev between two extreme positions on the same flake @xcite .",

    "all experiments are carried out at t=4  k. +        excitation of mos@xmath0 mls with a cw , circularly @xmath47 polarized laser results in strongly @xmath47 polarized pl of the neutral exciton x@xmath10 , as shown in fig .",

    "+ we have also explored the generation of robust valley coherence @xcite in these capped mls .",
    "as circularly polarized laser excitation induces valley polarization , excitation with a linearly polarized laser can generate a coherent superposition of valley states in the ml , referred to as valley coherence or optical alignment of excitons @xcite . as shown in panel b ) of fig.[fig : fig2 ] , excitation with a linearly polarized laser results in a highly linearly polarized pl emission for the neutral exciton , with a degree of linear polarization as high as @xmath51 in steady state ( the polarization - resolved components of the pl are shown in fig.[fig : fig3]d ) . obtaining higher @xmath52 than @xmath50 can be explained by the fact that the upper limit for the coherence time @xmath53 is twice the polarization lifetime @xmath54 , which can result in higher @xmath52 in steady state pl @xcite . here also the effects of the coulomb exchange interaction on the polarization eigenstates can play a role @xcite .",
    "note that the valley coherence starts to drop for excitation densities above @xmath55 , probably due to the effect of exciton - exciton interactions on valley coherence @xcite .",
    "the x@xmath10 integrated intensity depends linearly on the excitation density , as shown in fig.[fig : fig2]a , and the linewidth increases rapidly for laser powers above @xmath56 .",
    "this broadening is a signature of an excitation - induced dephasing that may be also responsible for the observed drop of the valley coherence .",
    "note that the absence of charged exciton emission in pl and in reflectivity suggests that this dephasing is dominated by exciton - exciton interactions , and not by exciton - carrier collisions .",
    "measuring the land g - factor is important for spin - valley physics , as it determines the energy separation achievable between the different polarization states @xcite .",
    "the g - factor , closely related to the effective mass tensor , also gives a fingerprint of the impact of different bands on the optical transitions @xcite .",
    "in addition spectacular effects are expected for monolayers with tunable electron density , where the evolution of the valley polarization and the valley zeeman splitting has been interpreted in terms of a fermi - polaron model for excitonic transitions , i.e. the simple definitions of neutral exciton and trion are replaced by the attractive and repulsive polaron @xcite .",
    "+ thanks to the very narrow exciton emission linewidth in our protected samples , we were able to perform magneto - pl experiments and observe a clear valley zeeman splitting at moderate magnetic fields .",
    "as shown in the schematics of fig.[fig : fig3]a , a magnetic field up to @xmath57 t is applied perpendicularly to the ml plane and the circular components of the pl are recorded as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3]a shows the polarization - resolved pl spectra at t@xmath58 k for different values of the magnetic field using a circularly - polarized cw laser at @xmath23 ev with a @xmath59 power density . note that the linewidth is comparable to the typical valley zeeman splitting @xmath60 at @xmath61 t , defined as the shift between the @xmath47 and @xmath48 polarized components of the pl .",
    "this energy splitting is found to depend linearly on the applied magnetic field ( as shown in fig.[fig : fig3]b ) , and using @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the bohr magneton , we extract an exciton g - factor of @xmath64 . reducing the incident power by 4 orders of magnitude did not result in any measurable change in the extracted g - factor .",
    "+ in addition we note that the circular polarization of the pl can be varied with the magnetic field , as shown in fig.[fig : fig3]c . at high positive magnetic fields , the valley splitting shifts the @xmath6 valley to lower energies , favouring the population of this valley in steady state conditions . in contrast , at high negative magnetic fields , populating the @xmath6 valley is energetically unfavourable , and as a consequence there is a reduction of the steady - state valley polarization .",
    "independent of the incident polarization of the laser , we observe an increase of the valley polarization at a rate of @xmath65 .",
    "note that in addition to simple arguments on population also coupling to different exciton states , such as optically dark states , as function of magnetic field can have an impact on the observed emission intensities in the circular basis .",

    "is presented in fig.[fig : fig3]e : we show the evolution of the linear polarization following linear excitation as a function of the magnetic field , but keeping the linear basis in detection fixed .",
    "a significant decrease is observed , which can have several origins : first , strong rotation of valley coherence resulting in small projection in the initial basis .",
    "as we measure only a small rotation angle @xmath75 , this rotation can only be partially responsible for the observed drop of the linear polarization .",

    "note that a smaller rotation angle of the pl with respect to the one observed in wse@xmath0@xcite and ws@xmath0 @xcite mls ( characterized by larger g - factors ) is indeed expected for a smaller exciton g - factor measured in our sample .",
