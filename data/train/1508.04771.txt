    "their working assumption is that star formation occurs in disks @xcite , and bulges are composed primarily of older stars .",
    "while the bulge contributes to the total stellar mass of the galaxy , it does not significantly contribute to the global star formation , thereby depressing the ssfr .",

    "assuming @xmath1 is a proxy for bulge - to - disk ratio , we see evidence to support the idea of @xcite : the slope of the star formation sequence is correlated with the build - up of bulges .",
    "we note , however , that even galaxies with @xmath1=1 exhibit some curvature of the star formation sequence , suggesting an additional mechanism acting to suppress star formation in massive galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : slope ] shows the slope of @xmath12 relation measured above the star - forming mass limits .",

    "@xcite demonstrated that a steeper slope of the star formation sequence is measured when selecting blue star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we measure a systematic decrease in the global ssfrs of galaxies with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "this flattening of the star formation sequence directly reflects the bimodality of the two stellar populations : quiescent galaxies tend to be bulge - dominated with significantly lower ssfrs , whereas star - forming galaxies are typically disk - dominated with ssfrs consistent with the main ridge of the star formation sequence ( confirming * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the measured sfr - m@xmath0 relation for galaxies with @xmath1=2 tracks the best - fit relations of @xcite in figure  [ fig : sersic_sfr ] .",
    "galaxies with @xmath1@xmath22 have a slightly steeper ( but still curved ) relation , whereas galaxies with @xmath1@xmath82 show a significantly flattened relation .",
    "we also see that @xmath1 correlates with the color bimodality of the populations ( figure  [ fig : uvj ] , panel a ) .",
    "when considering star - forming galaxies only , pure exponential - disk galaxies exhibit a higher slope of the @xmath12 relation than those with a significant bulge component .",
    "this result is somewhat dependent on how star - forming is defined : uvj - selected star - forming galaxies at @xmath3@xmath21 with @xmath1@xmath82 have rest - frame colors close to the quiescent region ( panel b , figure  [ fig : uvj ] ) .",
    "if we shift the quiescent box redward in @xmath20@xmath21 by + 0.10.3 mag and repeat the analysis , we find the same correlation between the slope of the star - formation sequence and @xmath1 at @xmath3@xmath21 .",
    "this is because high-@xmath1 galaxies drop out of the sample altogether but variations in the slope from @xmath1=0.5 to @xmath1=3 remain .",
    "the galaxies that lie in this intermediate region of rest - frame color space may be an extension of the quiescent population on the verge of shutting down star formation ( e.g. , @xcite , yano et al . in prep ) .",
    "they have more concentrated light profiles and lower ssfrs than typical star - forming galaxies .    for star - forming galaxies at @xmath3@xmath81 , the slope of the star - formation sequence",

    "the correlation is not statistically significant above @xmath1@xmath81 . shifting the uvj selection redward",
    "increasingly weakens the trend .",
    "perhaps the larger photometric errors of quiescent galaxies at high-@xmath3 scatter some into the intermediate parameter space , which get removed by this test .",
    "the @xmath1@xmath82 star - forming galaxies well separated from the uvj line show a similar range of colors to @xmath1@xmath22 star - forming galaxies ( compare panels d and g , figure  [ fig : uvj ] ) .",
    "they may also have similar ssfrs , although @xmath1@xmath83 star - forming galaxies are not prevalent at the highest masses .",
    "disk - dominated star - forming galaxies are neither preferentially dusty or dust - free ; their range in colors in figure  [ fig : uvj ] likely reflects the inclination angle through which we view the disk @xcite .",
    "the process of forming a significantly massive bulge at @xmath3@xmath81 appears to be connected to a transformation in the rest - frame optical galaxy structure and color before the decrease of the global ssfr of galaxies .",
    "panel d in figure  [ fig : uvj ] demonstrates that the galaxy morphology is in place at @xmath3@xmath62 before the reddening of the rest - frame colors associated with passive evolution .",
    "the observation that the correlation between the slope of the star - formation sequence and @xmath1 is weaker amongst star - forming galaxies at @xmath3@xmath81 may tell us something about bulge formation .",
    "traditional bulges may already be in place at @xmath3@xmath21 .",

    "the picture is less clear at higher redshifts ; it may be that massive galaxies are actively building up their bulges . from figures  [ fig :",
    "sersic]-[fig : slope ] , we see that bulge - dominated galaxies at high-@xmath3 exist , but do nt seem to have a significantly lower global ssfr . if the bulges of massive @xmath3@xmath62 galaxies are actively forming , the stars will still be young and there should not yet be a strong depression in global ssfrs .",
    "@xcite derived stellar ages for a large sample of quiescent galaxies at 0.1@xmath2@xmath3@xmath20.7 that are consistent with an equivalent single - burst star formation epoch of @xmath491.5 , supporting the idea that @xmath3@xmath62 is an important epoch for the bulge formation for massive galaxies .",
    "this does nt however tell us anything about how bulges grow .",
    "we can not tell if clumps of stars form insitu and migrate to the bulge due to disk instabilities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , if they are the result of a rich merger history ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or some other mechanism .    the best way to decompose the star formation histories of @xmath3@xmath62 galaxies will be with future spatially - resolved studies . for example , nelson et al .",
