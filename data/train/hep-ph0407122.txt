    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) offers the description of hadrons in terms of quarks and gluons .",
    "there are two basic ingredients of that picture : bound state dynamics of hadrons and fundamental interactions of quarks and gluons . while the former is still rather elusive to existing theoretical tools , the latter is rather well understood . the description of the hadronic processes at large momentum transfer is realized by making use of the factorization of high and low energy ( short and long distance ) dynamics .",
    "the existence of asymptotic freedom makes then the high energy part tractable to the perturbative calculation , i.e. , the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "exclusive processes are defined as the scattering reactions in which the kinematics of all initial and final state particles are specified , like , for example , the processes defining the hadron form factors ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) , the two - photon annihilation processes ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath4 ) , the hadron scatterings ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath4 ) , the decays of heavy hadrons ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath4 ) etc .",
    "the hard exclusive reactions , i.e. , the exclusive reactions at large momentum transfer ( or wide - angle ) , can be described by the so - called hard - scattering picture @xcite .",
    "the basis of this picture is the factorization of short and long distance dynamics , i.e , the factorization of the hard - scattering amplitude into the elementary hard - scattering amplitude and hadron distribution amplitudes one for each hadron involved in the process .",
    "usually the following standard approximations are made .",
    "hadron is replaced by the valent fock state , collinear approximation , in which hadron constituents are constrained to be collinear , is adopted , and the masses are neglected . for example , in the case of the pion this leads to replacing the pion by @xmath11 ( correct flavour structure has to be taken into account ) , adopting @xmath12 , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are pion , quark and antiquark momenta , respectively , while @xmath17 is the longitudinal momentum fraction , and taking @xmath18 .",
    "generally , the hard - scattering amplitude is then represented by the following convolution formula : @xmath19 \\quad { t_h}(x_{j } , \\ , { q^2},\\ , { \\mu_{f}^{2 } } )                \\quad { \\prod_{{h}_{i } } } \\ , \\phi_{{h}_{i}}(x_{j } , \\ , { \\mu_{f}^{2 } } ) \\ , , \\ ] ] @xmath20 = \\prod_{j=1}^{{n}_{h_i } } dx_{j } \\ ,              \\delta(1-\\sum_{k=1}^{{n}_{h_i } } x_{k } ) \\ , , \\label{eq : conv}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the process - dependent elementary hard - scattering amplitude , @xmath22 is the process - independent distribution amplitude ( da ) of the hadron @xmath23 , @xmath24 denotes the large momentum transfer while @xmath25 is the factorization scale at which the separation between short and long distance dynamics takes place .    within this framework leading - order ( lo )",
    "predictions have been obtained for many exclusive processes .",
    "it is well known , however , that , unlike in qed , the lo predictions in pqcd do not have much predictive power , and that higher - order corrections are essential for many reasons . in general , they have a stabilizing effect reducing the dependence of the predictions on the schemes and scales .",
    "therefore , to achieve a complete confrontation between theoretical predictions and experimental data , it is very important to know the size of radiative corrections to the lo predictions .",
    "the list of exclusive processes at large momentum transfer analyzed at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) is very short and includes only three processes : the meson electromagnetic form factor @xcite , the meson transition form factor @xcite , and the process @xmath26",
    "( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) @xcite .",
    "we note here that the meson transition form factor belongs to the same class of processes as the deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) @xcite ( @xmath29 ) , which recently has been extensively studied in the context of general parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite . regarding the elementary hard - scattering amplitude , these two processes , or correspondingly subprocesses @xmath30 and @xmath31 ,",
    "differ only in kinematic region and are related by crossing .",
    "still , the nlo correction to dvcs has been calculated independently @xcite .",
    "analogous connection exists between the pion electromagnetic form factor and the deeply virtual electroproduction of mesons ( dvem ) @xcite ( @xmath32 , the momentum transfer @xmath33 between the initial and the final proton is negligible , while the virtuality of the photon is large ) . in the context of subprocesses",
    ", there is a connection between @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in @xcite",
    "the use has been made of the nlo results for the pion electromagnetic form factor to obtain the nlo prediction for the specific case of dvem ( electroproduction of the pseudoscalar flavour non - singlet mesons ) . in this work",
    "we mostly discuss the meson form factor calculations .    at the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) only the @xmath36-proportional terms for the deeply virtual compton scattering and pion transition form factor have been explicitly calculated @xcite .",
    "the use of conformal constraints made it possible to circumvent the explicit calculation and to obtain the full nnlo results for the pion transition form factor @xcite .    finally , let us note that apart from the deeply virtual region , also the wide angle region has been investigated in the literature in the context of the compton scattering ( wacs ) , as well as , electroproduction of mesons ( waem ) @xcite .",
    "the nlo corrections were calculated only for the wacs @xcite .    in this paper the introduction to hard - scattering picture for exclusive processes is given in sec .",

    "let us explain the basic ingredients of the standard hard - scattering picture by taking as an example the simplest exclusive quantity , i.e. , the photon - to - pion transition form factor @xmath41 appearing in the amplitude of the process @xmath42 .",
    "at least one photon virtuality has to be large and we take here the simple case : @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the full amplitude is of the form @xmath45 and the transition form factor can be represented by a convolution @xmath46 here @xmath47 and @xmath25 is a factorization scale .",
    "the elementary hard - scattering amplitude @xmath21 obtained from @xmath48 is calculated using the pqcd . by definition , @xmath21 is free of collinear singularities and has a well  defined expansion in @xmath49 , with @xmath50 being the renormalization ( or coupling constant ) scale of the hard - scattering amplitude .",
    "thus , one can write @xmath51 the diagrams contributing to lo and representative diagrams contributing to nlo order are displayed in figs .",
    "[ f : tlo ] and [ f : tnlo ] , respectively .",

    "the former are removed by coupling constant ( @xmath37 ) renormalization introducing the scale @xmath50 , while the latter are factorized into the da at the scale @xmath25 .",
    "the pion distribution amplitude is defined in terms of the matrix elements of composite operators : @xmath52 . while the da form is taken as an ( nonperturbative ) input at some lower scale @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) , its evolution to the factorization scale @xmath25 ( @xmath55 ) is governed by pqcd .",
    "the da can hence be written in a form @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the evolution part of the da . in latter",
    "the resummation of @xmath58 terms is usually included , and @xmath57 is obtained by solving the evolution equation @xmath59 where @xmath60 represents the perturbatively calculable evolution kernel .",
    "one often introduces the distribution amplitude @xmath61 normalized to unity @xmath62 , and related to @xmath55 by @xmath63 where @xmath64 gev is the pion decay constant and @xmath65 is the number of colours .",
    "the solutions of the evolution equation ( [ eq : eveq ] ) combined with the nonperturbative input can then be written in a form of an expansion over gegenbauer polynomials @xmath66 which represent the eigenfunctions of the lo evolution equation : @xmath67 \\ , .\\ ] ] here @xmath68 denotes the sum over even indices . the nonperturbative input @xmath69 as well as",

    "as the da input one often takes the asymptotic function @xmath74 being the solution of the da evolution equation for @xmath75 and the simplest possibility .",
    "we list here two more choices from the literature @xmath76     \\phi_{bms}\\mbox{\\cite{bakulevms01 } } : &   b_2(1\\ ,   \\mbox{gev}^2)=0.188                \\qquad b_4(1\\ ,   \\mbox{gev}^2)=-0.13                   \\ , .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] the cz distribution amplitude is nowadays mostly ruled out ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and it is believed that even at lower energies the pion da is close to asymptotic form but probably end - point suppressed like the bms da .",
    "in this section we would like to discuss some properties inherent to all pqcd predictions .",
    "let us first briefly discuss the expansion parameter , i.e. , the qcd coupling constant .",
    "the qcd @xmath77 function given by @xmath78 is negative ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 is the number of active flavours ) and theory is asymptotically free . the usual one - loop solution of the renormalization group equation ( [ eq : beta ] )",
    "is given by @xmath81 and , obviously , @xmath82 , while , for example , @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "obviously , low - energy behaviour of such @xmath37 represents a problem due to the existence of the landau pole : @xmath85 . in the literature one can encounter several prescriptions to improve @xmath37 in low - energy region . for example , `` frozen '' coupling constant @xmath86 or analytical coupling @xcite @xmath87 \\ , .\\ ] ] but even these improved forms of @xmath37 give rather large values at lower energies",
    "thus , lo qcd predictions do not have much predictive power and higher - order corrections are important .",
    "generally , the pqcd amplitude can be written in a form @xmath88 where @xmath24 is some large momentum and as usual @xmath50 represents the renormalization scale .",
    "the truncation of the perturbative series to finite order introduces the residual dependence of the results on the renormalization scale @xmath89 and scheme ( to the order we are calculating these dependences can be represented by one parameter , say , the scale ) .",
    "inclusion of higher order corrections decreases this dependence .",
    "nevertheless , we are still left with intrinsic theoretical uncertainty of the perturbative results .",
    "one can try to estimate this uncertainty ( see , for example , @xcite ) or one can try to find the `` optimal '' renormalization scale @xmath89 ( and scheme ) on the basis of some physical arguments . in the latter case , one can assess the size of the higher order corrections and of the expansion parameter .",
    "these values can then serve as a sensible criteria for the convergence of the expansion .",
    "the simplest and widely used choice for @xmath89 is @xmath90 , and the justification is mainly pragmatic .",
    "however , physical arguments suggest that the more appropriate scale @xmath89 is lower .",
    "namely , since each external momentum entering an exclusive reaction is partitioned among many propagators of the underlying hard - scattering amplitude , the physical scales that control these processes are inevitably much softer than the overall momentum transfer . there are number of suggestions in the literature . according to fastest apparent convergence ( fac ) procedure @xcite ,",
    "the scale @xmath89 is determined by the requirement that the nlo coefficient in the perturbative expansion of the physical quantity in question vanishes , i.e. , one demands @xmath91 . on the other hand , following the principle of minimum sensitivity ( pms ) @xcite one mimics the independence of the all order expansion on the scale @xmath89 , and one chooses the renormalization scale @xmath89 at the stationary point of the truncated perturbative series : @xmath92 . in the brodsky - lepage - mackenzie ( blm )",
    "procedure @xcite , all vacuum - polarization effects from the qcd @xmath77-function are resummed into the running coupling constant .",
    "according to blm procedure , the renormalization scale best suited to a particular process in a given order can , in practice , be determined by setting the scale demanding that @xmath77-proportional terms should vanish : @xmath93 and @xmath94    as it is known , the relations between physical observables must be independent of renormalization scale and scheme conventions to any fixed order of perturbation theory . in ref .",
    "@xcite was argued that applying the blm scale - fixing to perturbative predictions of two observables in , for example , @xmath73 scheme and then algebraically eliminating @xmath95 one can relate any perturbatively calculable observables without scale and scheme ambiguity , where the choice of blm scale ensures that the resulting `` commensurate scale relation '' ( csr ) is independent of the choice of the intermediate renormalization scheme . following this approach , in paper by brodsky _",
    "et al._@xcite the several exclusive hadronic amplitudes were analyzed in @xmath96 scheme , in which the effective coupling @xmath97 is defined from the heavy - quark potential @xmath98 . the @xmath96 scheme is a natural , physically based scheme , which by definition automatically incorporates vacuum polarization effects .",
    "the @xmath99 scale which then appears in the @xmath96 coupling reflects the mean virtuality of the exchanged gluons .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath96 is an effective running coupling defined from the physical observable it must be finite at low momenta , and the appropriate parameterization of the low - energy region should in principle be included . the scale - fixed relation between the @xmath95 and @xmath96 couplings",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath100 where @xmath101 is defined from the heavy - quark potential @xmath102 and @xmath103",
    "as mentioned in sec . [ sec : intro ] , only the small number of exclusive processes have been analyzed in higher orders .",

    "the numerical result is thus not particularly realistic .",
    "new ( general ) nlo calculation is in preparation and for that purpose convenient general analytical method for evaluation of one - loop feynman integrals has been developed @xcite .",
    "recently , the conformal symmetry constraints were used to obtain the nnlo prediction for the photon - to - pion transition form factor @xcite .",
    "the crucial ingredients of this approach lie in the fact that the massless pqcd is invariant under conformal transformations provided that the @xmath77 function vanishes , and that @xmath132 belongs to a class of two - photon processes calculable by means of the operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "one can then make use of the predictive power of the conformal ope ( cope ) , the dis results for the nonsinglet coefficient function of the polarized structure function @xmath133 known to nnlo order @xcite and the explicitly calculated @xmath77-proportional nnlo terms @xcite .",
    "let us first introduce the basic ingredients of the formalism .",
    "for the general case of the pion transition form factor @xmath134 one expresses the results in terms of @xmath135 it is convenient to turn the convolution formula ( [ eq : fpigammaconv ] ) into the sum over conformal moments @xmath136 here @xmath137 is the @xmath138th conformal moment of the elementary hard - scattering amplitude , while @xmath139 where @xmath140 represents composite conformal operator , and @xmath141 .    for the thorough review of the conformal transformations and their applications we refer to @xcite . on the quantum level conformal symmetry",
    "is broken owing to the regularization and renormalization of uv divergences : coupling constant renormalization resulting in @xmath77-proportional terms and the renormalization of composite operators .",
    "the latter represents the origin of non - diagonal nlo anomalous dimensions in @xmath73 scheme and can be removed by finite renormalization of the hard - scattering and distribution amplitude , i.e. , by the specific choice of the factorization scheme .",
    "first , we pose the question weather we can find a factorization scheme in which conformal symmetry holds true up to @xmath77-proportional terms ?",
    "renormalization group equation for the operators @xmath142 , equivalent to the da evolution equation ( [ eq : eveq ] ) , is given by @xmath143 where the anomalous dimension matrix , corresponding to the evolution kernel ( [ eq : kernel ] ) , is given by @xmath144 with @xmath145 .",
    "since the conformal symmetry holds at lo , the anomalous dimensions are diagonal at lo .",
    "similarly non - diagonal terms present in the @xmath73 scheme beyond lo , originate in breaking of conformal symmetry due to the renormalization of the composite operators .",
    "in contrast , the conformal subtraction ( cs ) scheme defined by @xmath146 and @xmath147 preserves the conformal symmetry up to @xmath77-proportional terms .",
    "second , we ask weather and how can we use the predictive power of conformal symmetry ? the process of interest belongs to quite a large class of two - photon processes calculable by means of ope @xcite .",
    "dvcs , deeply inelastic lepton ",
    "hadron scattering ( dis ) and production of various hadronic final states by photon ",
    "photon fusion belong to this class of processes .",
    "such processes can be described by a general scattering amplitude given by the time - ordered product of two - electromagnetic currents sandwiched between the hadronic states . for a specific process",
    ", the generalized bjorken kinematics at the light - cone can be reduced to the corresponding kinematics , while the particular hadron content of the process reflects itself in the non - perturbative part of the amplitude .",
    "hence , the generalized hard - scattering amplitude enables us to relate predictions of different two - photon processes on partonic level .",
    "conformal ope ( cope ) for two - photon processes works under the assumption that conformal symmetry holds ( cs scheme and @xmath77=0 ) , and the wilson coefficients are then , up to normalization , fixed by the ones appearing in dis structure function @xmath133 ( calculated to nnlo order ) .",

    "the @xmath96 scheme could as in the case of the pion electromagnetic form factor offer the way out and physically better motivated description of the transition form factor .",
    "we mention , that , as already noticed in @xcite and shown in @xcite , the significance of higher - conformal moments decreases with @xmath157 and that with decreasing @xmath157 the difference between various schemes also decreases .",
    "hence , small @xmath157 region is suitable for a novel test of pqcd .",
    "although the higher - order qcd corrections are important , only few exclusive processes have been explicitly calculated to nlo order .",
    "the inclusion of higher - order corrections stabilizes the dependence on renormalization scale .",
    "still , the usual choice @xmath158 $ ] leads to large corrections .",
    "other choices of scales ( blm , @xmath96 scheme ) are preferable and more physical .",
    "more effort in calculating higher - order corrections are needed and some tools applicable to the kinematic region of interest are underway .",
    "furthermore , for some processes ( example : nnlo calculation of photon - to - pion transition form factor ) , one can make use of the predictive power of conformal symmetry to avoid cumbersome higher - order calculations .",
