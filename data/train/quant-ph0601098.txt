    "quantum information has some fundamental differences from classical information .",
    "one of the most famous of these is the inability to perfectly clone an arbitrary quantum state .",
    "this important observation , first enunciated by wootters and zurek , is referred to as the no - cloning theorem @xcite .",
    "while quantum mechanics precludes perfect cloning it does allow one to create approximate clones .",
    "the first such scheme was implicit in the proof of the no - cloning theorem .",
    "this cloning procedure perfectly cloned states from a designated orthogonal basis , but faired less well with states that were a superposition within the prescribed basis .    since this work many other cloning machines have been devised .",
    "although the various cloners all share the same common goal of trying to copy a quantum state , the precise way that this is achieved differs due to the different specifications that they are subject to .",
    "one example is the _ universal cloner _ of buzek and hillery @xcite , which was designed to clone all qubit states equally well and produces two identical output cloned states .",
    "dropping the requirement that the clones should be identical is sometimes useful and leads to the _ universal asymmetric cloner _ @xcite .",
    "another approach is to try to clone a restricted set of states as well a possible .",
    "such cloners are known as state dependent cloners @xcite .",
    "the cloning machine of wootters and zurek is an example of a state dependent cloner , where the states of interest are orthogonal .",
    "the examples given thus far have applied to cloning 2-level systems ( qubits ) ; imperfect cloning of @xmath0-level systems is , however , also possible @xcite . yet another important development is the experimental implementation of cloning @xcite . for a thorough review of all these topics see @xcite .",
    "the cloners described thus far are sometimes referred to as _",
    "deterministic _ , as they always return the same output for each particular input state .",
    "_ probabilistic cloners _ also exist @xcite .",
    "these allow a state , drawn from a specific linearly independent set , to be cloned exactly with a certain probability , in such a way that one knows when the cloning has succeeded and when it has failed .",
    "the relationship between deterministic and probabilistic cloners is similar to the relationship between minimum error state discrimination and unambiguous state discrimination @xcite . in minimum error state discrimination",
    ", we are given a quantum state drawn from a known set of states , and we seek to determine which one . if , however , the states we wish to distinguish between are non - orthogonal , then we can not distinguish them perfectly . therefore we aim to distinguish between the states as well as possible , by minimising the overall probability of error . in unambiguous state discrimination , on the other hand , we seek to never mis - identify a state .",
    "the price we must pay to achieve this is to accept that we will sometimes not get an answer at all . to illustrate this , consider the case of two non - orthogonal states @xmath1 , @xmath2 . for unambiguous discrimination",
    "we would require three outcomes corresponding to the state being @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and to the outcome of the experiment being undetermined .",
    "for a review of state discrimination see @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall explore another connection between measurement and cloning .",
    "one way of performing a _ joint measurement _ of two observables would be to first clone the quantum system to produce two copies , and then to measure one quantum observable on each clone . while this approach can be used to jointly measure any pair of observables , it is important to note that current cloning procedures have not been devised with this in mind .",
    "we will derive the optimal cloning procedure with respect to measuring two incompatible spin components of a spin-1/2 particle .",
    "the paper will be organised in the following way : in section [ sharpness ] , we introduce joint quantum measurements .",
    "we evaluate how effective current cloners are for the task of performing a joint measurement of two spin components of a spin-1/2 particle . after this we shall describe an existing scheme for performing a joint measurement of two components of spin .",
    "this will lead us , in section [ construct ] , to a cloning scheme which is optimal with respect to the task of performing a joint measurement of spin . in section [ fid ]",
    "we shall calculate the global fidelity for this cloning procedure .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in section [ discussion ] .",
    "a joint quantum measurement of two observables is a _ single _ measurement of a quantum system that allows us to simultaneously give values to _ both _ observables . when the two observables of interest commute , then the joint measurement can be accomplished with standard von neumann or projective quantum measurements .",
    "when the observables do not commute then we must adopt a more generalized view of quantum measurements .",
    "this is provided by the probability operator measures ( poms ) , also called positive operator valued measures ( povms ) . in the pom formalism each measurement outcome has assigned to it a measurement operator @xmath5 , with the probability for outcome @xmath6 given by @xmath7 for any measured state @xmath8 .",
    "this requirement leads to the fact that the measurement operators @xmath9 must have eigenvalues which are either positive or zero .",
    "there is no requirement , however , that the measurement operators are projectors onto eigenstates .",
    "the measurement operators must also sum to the identity operator , as the sum of all the probabilities for different outcomes is one .",
    "we should point out that one feature of generalized measurments is that the number of measurement operators and outcomes is not restricted to be less than or equal to the number of dimensions of the measured quantum system .",
    "a detailed discussion of this elegant approach can be found in references @xcite .",
    "one of the earliest investigations of joint measurements was that of arthurs and kelly @xcite , who discussed simultaneous measurements of position and momentum .",
    "their method was to introduce two ancillary systems that would track both the position and momentum of the particle .",
    "this method was extended by arthurs and goodman to yield an uncertainty principle for any two jointly measured observables @xcite .",
    "it is frequently assumed that joint measurements satisfy the _ joint unbiasedness condition _",
    "this condition states that the expectation values for the jointly measured observables should be proportional to the expectation values for the observables measured by themselves . for the case of jointly measuring two components of a spin-@xmath10 system",
    ", we shall denote the directions of the two components by the unit vectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the observables that we seek to measure are @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a vector , the cartesian components of which are the familiar pauli matrices .",
    "the joint unbiasedness condition will now take the form @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the expectation values for the jointly measured observables .",
    "we will assume that the measurement outcomes are @xmath20 , so that the magnitude of the real constants @xmath21 and @xmath22 will vary between one and zero .",
    "if they assume the value one , then we say that the measurement of the associated component is completely sharp , and it will correspond to a projective or von neumann measurement of the component .",
    "alternatively if one of the constants is zero then the measurement of the associated component is said to be completely unsharp and we would have done no worse by guessing the outcome .",
    "the price for performing a joint measurement of incompatible observables is that the uncertainty in the estimates of the observables will increase . in other words ,",
    "the variances of jointly measured spin components will be larger than the variances of the spin components measured by themselves .",
    "this leads us to say that joint measurements are unsharp @xcite .",
    "for the case of a spin-1/2 particle , the values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 will be restricted by the inequality @xcite @xmath25 if a joint measurement scheme allows us to saturate inequality ( [ ineq ] ) , then , for given directions * a * and * b * , this measurement gives the largest possible values of @xmath23 for a given @xmath24 .",
    "any joint measurement of two components of spin for which inequality ( [ ineq ] ) is saturated shall be called an _ optimal _ joint measurement .",
    "we can now evaluate how effective the various existing cloners are for performing joint measurements .",
    "it turns out that none of these allow us to saturate the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) for all states , as they have not been devised with joint measurements in mind . as an example we will consider the universal cloner @xcite",
    "this cloner produces two identical cloned states , each having a bloch vector pointing in the same direction as the original bloch vector of the state .",
    "the magnitude of the bloch vectors is , however , reduced by the factor @xmath26 .",
    "hence if we initially had the state @xmath27 , then the universal cloner would return two identical states @xmath28 .",
    "if we measure the @xmath11 component of spin on one clone , and the @xmath12 component of spin on the other clone , then we can realise a joint measurement of the two components with @xmath23 and @xmath24 both equal to @xmath26 .",
    "it can be seen that the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) can never be saturated for these values of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "even if we use a cloner that operates under less restrictive conditions , such as the universal asymmetrical cloner @xcite , ( [ ineq ] ) can not be satisfied except in the trivial cases of @xmath29 , @xmath30 or @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "this begs the question of whether it is possible to construct a cloning machine that can be used to perform an optimal joint measurement . in section [ construct ]",
    ", we shall show this can be done .",
    "as has just been stated , none of the existing cloning machines can be used to perform an optimal joint measurement .",
    "however such measurement schemes do exist , and a particularly simple one is outlined in @xcite .",
    "the essence of this procedure is to introduce two new axes to measure along , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] as @xmath33 and @xmath34 . each time a measurement is performed ,",
    "a choice of which axis to measure along is made .",
    "the probability of measuring along @xmath33 is given by @xmath35 and the probability of measuring along @xmath34 by @xmath36 .",
    "if we measure along @xmath33 and obtain the outcome spin up along @xmath33 , then this is interpreted as spin along both @xmath11 and @xmath37 being spin up .",
    "conversely if we obtain spin down along @xmath33 , then this is interpreted as spin down along both @xmath11 and @xmath12 . for the case when we measure along @xmath34 , the result spin up along @xmath34",
    "is taken as the component of spin along @xmath11 being spin up and the component of spin along @xmath12 being spin down , and the result spin down along @xmath34 is interpreted as @xmath11 being spin down and the @xmath12 being spin up .",
    "it can be seen that the four measurement operators that describe the measurement are @xmath38 the joint probability distribution @xmath39 can be calculated by taking the expectation values of the measurement operators ( [ mo ] ) .",
    "the marginal probability distributions , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , can then be obtained from the joint probability distribution .",
    "equivalently , we may obtain the marginal probability distributions directly from the marginal measurement operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the directions of @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be deduced from the condition of joint unbiasedness .",
    "this criterion imposes the constraint @xmath44 , which implies that @xmath45 similarly , the constraint @xmath46 implies that @xmath47 the conditions ( [ ju1 ] ) and ( [ ju2 ] ) suggest that a suitable choice for @xmath33 and @xmath34 would be @xmath48 as these are unit vectors , it can be seen that @xmath49 and thus the condition that @xmath50 ensures that this measurement scheme is optimal .",
    "a more detailed discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "this measurement procedure can be used to construct a cloner that enables us to perform an optimal joint measurement , which will be considered next .",
    "it should not be surprising that the current cloning procedures do not represent optimal means of realising joint measurements .",
    "this is as they have been conceived with the notion of maximising the fidelity between the input state and the output cloned states .",
    "the cloning device that we shall outline is designed to saturate inequality ( [ ineq ] ) , and as such it should be expected that its fidelity will be lower than that of some of the existing cloners .",
    "heuristically we can imagine that this cloner operates by cloning the @xmath51 and @xmath12 components of spin of the input state onto its outputs .",
    "now let @xmath52 and @xmath53 represent the eigenstates of spin along @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "in addition to this let @xmath54 represent the state that is to be cloned and let @xmath55 represent the second ` blank ' qubit to which information will be transferred .",
    "then we should expect that the action of our cloner is @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where these joint probabilities are those of an optimal joint measurement .",
    "thus we find that the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients in ( [ action ] ) yield the same joint probability distribution as we would calculate from the measurement operators ( [ mo ] ) . now a projective measurement along the @xmath51 direction on the first qubit and along @xmath12 on the second qubit of @xmath61 will implement a joint measurement of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 components of spin of the state @xmath54 .    to construct the unitary operator @xmath62 that implements the cloning process",
    ", we require an important result that applies to poms .",
    "it can be shown that any pom can be realised as a projective measurement by extending the dimensions of the systems hilbert space .",
    "this result is known as _ naimark s theorem _ , a proof of which can be found in @xcite . to illustrate this theorem consider the pertinent situation of performing a joint measurement of two components of spin of a spin-1/2 particle .",
    "the state @xmath54 of the particle is described in a two - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "we can add another spin-1/2 particle which is prepared in the state @xmath63 . to describe this new combined system , with state vector @xmath64 , we require a four - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "naimark s theorem assures us that there exists an orthonormal basis @xmath65 , where @xmath66 , which has the property latexmath:[\\[\\label{basiscondition }    hence we may realise the joint measurement by performing a projective measurement upon the state @xmath64 .",
    "if we find such a measurement basis @xmath65 , then it is clear that latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is given by ( [ prob ] ) .",
    "a plot of the averaged fidelity is shown in figure [ plot3 ] . in this figure , @xmath24 was chosen to have its largest possible value consistent with the choice of @xmath23 and @xmath79 .",
    "it was found in @xcite that the universal cloner produces clones with a fidelity of @xmath119 .",
    "thus the two particle fidelity of the univeral cloner is @xmath120 . comparing this to figure [ plot3 ]",
    "we observe that the universal cloner produces clones with a higher fidelity than the cloner we are considering .",
    "we can also define fidelities for the single particle reduced states @xmath93 and @xmath94 to be @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "these fidelities can then be averaged in the same manner as ( [ average ] ) .",
    "this yields the results @xmath123 the fact that the averaged fidelities are not equal is to be expected , as the process that we are performing is inherently asymmetric with respect to the * a * and * b * directions . to elaborate further upon this , the reduced states @xmath93 and @xmath94 contain information about the measurement statistics of measurements along the @xmath11 and @xmath12 axes of the state @xmath54 . provided @xmath124 , we should not expect @xmath93 and @xmath94 to be equal , and thus we should not expect @xmath125 to equal @xmath126 .",
    "for the case when @xmath127 , i.e. @xmath128 , it is possible to have @xmath129 and thus the equations ( [ fa ] ) and ( [ fb ] ) will both yield the answer of @xmath130 for the averaged fidelity .",
    "the cloning process we have considered leaves information relating to spin along the * a * direction in the original qubit state , and transfers information relating to spin along * b * onto a blank qubit .",
    "we could , of course , equally well consider a cloning process which would leave the information relating to * b * in the original qubit , and copy the information relating to * a * onto the blank state .",
    "the fidelities in equations ( [ fa ] ) and ( [ fb ] ) would then be reversed with respect to @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "one could also consider devising a cloning procedure which would be more symmetric with respect to * a * and * b * as far as the fidelities for the single particle reduced states are concerned .",
    "this cloning procedure would still give the same measurement statistics .",
    "the possibility of many different cloning procedures , all yielding the same measurement statistics , is due to the fact that there are infinitely many ways of realising the joint quantum measurement , in terms of how to make the naimark extension .    in section [ realisation ]",
    "a way of realising a joint measurement of two components of spin was outlined .",
    "as our cloner is primarily concerned with replicating measurement statistics , it may seem more natural to use the measurement scheme of section [ sharpness ] in a more direct fashion to prepare the clones .",
    "we could just perform the joint measurement and then prepare one of the basis states @xmath133 corresponding to the obtained outcome .",
    "this process would , on average , yield the mixed state @xmath134 the state ( [ mixed ] ) is simpler to create and gives the same measurement statistics as @xmath135 .",
    "there is , however , a difference between the two cloning procedures .",
    "this difference manifests itself within the averaged fidelities of the two processes .",
    "we can define the fidelity , @xmath136 , of @xmath137 with the original state @xmath54 as @xmath138 when we average @xmath136 over all the pure qubit states , then we find that the averaged fidelity is less than ( [ averaged ] ) , as is shown in figure [ plot3 ] .",
    "it is informative to consider the two reduced states @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "the averaged fidelities may be calculated for these states and are found to be @xmath141 it may be seen that @xmath142 but that @xmath143 .",
    "this result again shows that only information pertaining to the @xmath12 component is transferred to the second qubit , where as the first qubit retains additional information about the original state .",
    "we have looked at how quantum cloning can be used to perform joint quantum measurements of two components of spin .",
    "a criterion for judging the optimality of a joint measurement was discussed .",
    "we then introduced a cloning machine which can be used to perform an optimal joint measurements of spin .",
    "this cloning scheme could be though to act by cloning the @xmath11 and @xmath12 components of spin onto its outputs .",
    "fidelities for the cloner were also investigated .",
    "we could compare these results to that of the universal cloner , which provides clones with a fidelity of @xmath144 for all input states .",
    "thus its two particle averaged fidelity would simply be @xmath1450.6944 .",
    "hence the fidelity of the universal cloner is , as expected , higher than that of the cloner presented in section [ construct ] .",
    "finally we compared the cloning procedure to a more direct approach producing the mixed state output ( [ mixed ] ) .",
    "it was found that the averaged fidelity for the cloning procedure outline in section [ construct ] was greater than or equal to the fidelity of the mixed state procedure .",
    "thus the added complexity of the method outlined in section [ construct ] may be balanced against the higher fidelity that it provides .",
