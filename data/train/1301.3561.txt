    "<S> the announcement of superconductivity in the intermetallic compound mgcni@xmath0 has generated a great amount of excitement since its discovery in 2001 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this material has gained so much interest because it is a superconductor with a transition temperature near 7 k and it shares the same perovskite structure as that of the high-@xmath10 cuprates but with the o atoms replaced by ni . </S>",

    "<S> previous tunnel diode resonator experiments on this material have been performed on polycrystalline samples and powders and it was found that the low temperature behavior was quadratic @xcite , which would point to the existence of nodes in the superconducting gap function . however , it may have been the case that inter - grain interactions in those samples studied may have influenced the data . </S>",

    "<S> a detailed description of the application of this technique to study london and campbell penetration depths in superconductors can be found in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> the principle elements of the setup consist of an @xmath41 self - oscillating circuit supported by a tunnel diode . </S>",
    "<S> the tunnel diode has a heavily doped and extremely thin ( 10 nm ) p - n junction , which gives it useful properties not common to ordinary diodes . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath42 curve contains a region of negative differential resistance and when the diode is biased to this region , it acts as an @xmath43 power source for the tank circuit . </S>",
    "<S> the tank circuit oscillates with a natural resonance frequency of @xmath44 , which is very near 14 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> the sample to be studied is mounted on a sapphire rod and inserted into the inductor coil of the oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> the sample changes the resonance frequency of the circuit through its interaction with the @xmath45 magnetic field of the coil , which is on the order of 0.1 @xmath46 t . </S>",
    "<S> this small value of the excitation field of the coil ensures that its effect on the state of the sample is negligible and hence this technique is non - perturbative . for a superconductor below its critical temperature , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath45 magnetic field of the coil has a characteristic decay length , commonly referred to as the london penetration depth @xmath47 , which is a function of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the measured change in frequency , @xmath48 , is proportional to the dynamic magnetic susceptibility of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> this susceptibility may be written in terms of this penetration depth and a characteristic radius of the sample @xmath49 , which is calculated using a procedure given in reference @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> g _ can be measured directly by extracting the sample from the coil at the lowest temperature of the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> since the effective radius of the sample , @xmath49 , is much greater than the penetration depth , @xmath47 , this expression can be rewritten so that changes in the resonant frequency are proportional to changes in the penetration depth    @xmath54    the most valuable feature that this technique has to offer is not the ability to measure the actual value of the penetration depth , but rather its variation with temperature to great precision , @xmath55 , with @xmath56 being the minimum temperature that can be reached during the experiment . the noise level of the system used for this experiment is @xmath9 0.1 hz / hour , which combined with the natural resonance frequency of the system of 14 mhz corresponds to a resolution on the order of parts per billion . </S>",
    "<S> this level of precision allows for the measurement of @xmath57 to a single ngstrm . </S>",

    "<S> one early theoretical work done on the effect of disorder induced pinning on a vortex lattice considered that instead of the usual abrikosov lattice , there exists a quasi - ordered bragg glass phase and that the peak effect is a sign of the transition from this phase into a disordered vortex phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> tdr experiments on bscco 2212 @xcite may suggest that the observed hysteresis is a result of ramping the magnetic field after zero - field cooling giving rise to macroscopic screening supercurrents , _ j _ , which shift the vortices into a state of inhomogeneous distribution , which is in agreement with the critical state ( bean ) model . in this scenario , </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath6 is found to be isotropic for two different directions of applied magnetic field with @xmath96 t by using the standard helfand and werthamer analysis . </S>",
    "<S> this value corresponds to the coherence length of 5.2 nm and together with @xmath65 = 245 nm gives a ginsburg - landau parameter of @xmath97 . by studying the effect of field - cooling versus field - warming on the susceptibility , </S>",
