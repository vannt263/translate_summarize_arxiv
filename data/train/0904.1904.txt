    "the perseus cluster=0.0179 and luminosity distance @xmath15 = 75.3 mpc , for a hubble constant @xmath16 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 in a flat universe with @xmath17 , implying 21.5 kpc / arcmin . ] is the brightest cluster of galaxies in the x - ray band and has been the focus of extensive research over many years and wavelengths .",
    "the cluster hosts the giant elliptical galaxy ngc 1275 at its center .",
    "ngc 1275 has been variously classified as a seyfert 1.5 because of its emission - line optical spectrum , where broad lines are detected ( veron - cetty & veron 1998 ) , but also as a blazar due to the strong and rapid variability of the continuum emission and its polarization ( e.g. , angel & stockman 1980 ; see also pronik , merkulova & metik 1999 ) . in the radio , ngc 1275 hosts the exceptionally bright radio source perseus  a , also known as 3c  84 .",
    "the source 3c  84 has a strong , compact nucleus which has been studied in detail with vlbi ( vermeulen et al 1994 , taylor et al .",
    "1996 , walker et al .",
    "2000 , asada et al .",
    "these observations reveal a compact core and a bowshock - like southern jet component moving steadily outwards at 0.3 mas / year ( kellermann et al .",
    "2004 ; lister et al .",
    "the northern counterjet is also detected , though it is much less prominent due to doppler dimming , as well as to free - free absorption due to an intervening disk .",
    "walker , romney & benson ( 1994 ) derive from these observations that the jet has an intrinsic velocity of @xmath18 oriented at an angle @xmath19 to the line of sight .",
    "polarization has recently been detected in the southern jet ( taylor et al .",
    "2006 ) , suggesting increasingly strong interactions of the jet with the surrounding environment .",
    "the radio emission continues on larger scales , and shows a clear interaction with the hot cluster gas .",
    "observations with @xmath20 ( bhringer et al .",
    "1993 ) and later @xmath21 ( fabian et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ) reveal the presence of cavities in the gas , suggesting that the jets of 3c  84 have blown multiple bubbles in the hot intracluster medium .",
    "perseus is the nearest and best example of a prototypical  cooling core \" cluster in which the radiative cooling time of the x - ray emitting gas is considerably shorter than the age of the universe . for a @xmath22-model ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ) ,",
    "the core radius of the perseus cluster is @xmath23 @xmath24 0.3 mpc ( or @xmath24 0.3@xmath25 ; see , e.g. , ettori et al .",
    "1998 ; churazov et al . 2003 ) .",
    "heating by the central agn is thought to be responsible for balancing the radiative cooling , although the exact mechanisms by which the energy is transported and dissipated are still unclear .",
    "shocks and ripples are clearly evident in the deep @xmath21 image of perseus , and could provide steady heating of the center of the cluster ( fabian et al .",
    "2005 ; 2006 ) . on even larger scales , perseus is one of the few clusters exhibiting a mini - halo of size @xmath24300 kpc seen in low - frequency radio emission ( burns et al . 1990 ) .",
    "this mini - halo is presumed to arise from synchrotron emission from widely distributed relativistic particles and fields energized in the central regions of the cluster .",
    "furthermore , the perseus cluster appears to contain a nonthermal component , namely an excess of hard x - ray emission above the thermal bremsstrahlung from the diffuse hot cluster gas . based on a deep @xmath21 observation",
    ", the non - thermal x - ray component has been mapped over the core of the cluster and shows a morphology similar to the radio mini - halo ( sanders , fabian & dunn 2005 ; sanders & fabian 2007 ) .",
    "this claim was , however , questioned on the basis of a long @xmath26-@xmath27 exposure ( molendi & gastaldello 2009 ) . above 10 kev",
    ", a hard x - ray component has been detected with @xmath28-@xmath29 ( primini et al .",
    "1981 ) and @xmath30/pds ( nevalainen et al . 2004 ) , although it was not detected with @xmath31/osse in the 0.05@xmath32 10 mev range ( osako et al . 1994 ) .",
    "more recently , 10 galaxy clusters were detected in the 15@xmath3255 kev range with @xmath33/bat ( ajello et al .",
    "perseus is the only cluster that displays a high - energy non - thermal component up to 200 kev , but the hard tail seen in the bat spectrum is likely due to nuclear emission from ngc 1275 rather than to non - thermal emission from the intercluster medium .",
    "this idea is supported by possible flux variations compared to past hard x - ray observations , and by the fact that the extrapolation of the bat spectrum is in good agreement with the luminosity of the nucleus as measured with @xmath26-@xmath27 ( churazov et al .",
    "2003 ) .    at higher energies , @xmath1-ray observations toward ngc 1275 and the perseus clusters",
    "were first reported in the 1980 s by strong & bignami ( 1983 ) .",
    "the @xmath34 @xmath35 data , taken between 1975@xmath321979 ( strong et al . 1982 ; mayer - hasselwander et al .",
    "1982 ) , show a @xmath1-ray excess at the position of the galaxy , although evidence for emission @xmath36 related to ngc 1275 is ambiguous ( positional uncertainties were not given for the @xmath34 @xmath35 data ) .",
    "interpreted as emission from ngc 1275 , the @xmath1-ray flux was @xmath37 = 8.3 @xmath7 @xmath8 ph(@xmath38 mev ) @xmath10 s@xmath11 .",
    "further observations in the mev - gev range were made by @xmath31/egret in the 1990 s as part of a search for @xmath1-ray emission from 58 clusters of galaxies between 1991 and 2000 ( reimer et al .",
    "no evidence was found for high - energy @xmath1-ray emission of individual clusters , nor as a population .",
    "the 2@xmath39 upper limit for the perseus cluster / ngc  1275 is @xmath37 @xmath40 3.72@xmath7@xmath41 ph ( @xmath42 mev ) @xmath10 s@xmath11 , which is more than an order of magnitude lower than the flux reported by @xmath34 @xmath35 .",
    "observations with improved sensitivity , now possible with @xmath2 , are crucial to confirm @xmath1-ray emission from ngc 1275 and possible time variability .",
    "there are several reasons to think that the perseus / ngc  1275 ( 3c  84 ) system could be a @xmath1-ray emitter .",
    "first , a few extragalactic @xmath43-blazar sources , namely centaurus a , an fr i radio galaxy ( sreekumar et al . 1999 ) , 3c  111 , a broad line radio galaxy ( nandikotkur et al .  2007 ; hartman et al . 2008 ) , and possibly the radio galaxy ngc  6251 ( mukherjee et al . 2002 ) , were already detected with egret .",
    "in contrast to blazars , which form the majority of extragalactic @xmath1-ray sources ( hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) , most radio galaxies have large inclination angles and hence there is no significant amplification of the emission due to doppler beaming .",
    "however , if the jet has velocity gradients ( see georganopoulos & kazanas 2003b for a decelerating flow and ghisellini et al .",
    "2005 for a spine - sheath velocity profile ) , as suggested by recent radio / x - ray observations ( e.g. , for transversal profiles , see laing & bridle 2002 ; kataoka et al .",
    "2006 ) , it is possible to produce bright @xmath1-ray emission from the nuclei of some radio galaxies via the inverse compton process where the emission from the slow part is amplified in the rest - frame of the faster part , and vice - versa .",
    "second , @xmath1-ray emission from the cluster is also expected as a result of ( 1 ) secondary nuclear interactions of high - energy cosmic rays with the intercluster medium or as the origin of a secondary population of relativistic electrons ( berezinsky et al .",
    "1997 , atoyan & vlk 2000 ) ; ( 2 ) particle acceleration at large - scale scale shocks in forming clusters ( e.g. , totani & kitayama 2000 ) , or at a shock excited by an agn outburst at the cluster center ( fujita et al .",
    "2007 ) ; and ( 3 ) dark matter annihilation , which also acts as a heat source in the core of cooling flow clusters ( totani 2004 ) .",
    "in contrast to the emission from a compact agn region , @xmath1-rays from clusters would be steady on the observing time scales .",
    "hence time variability , if detected , provides an important clue to the origin of the @xmath1-ray emission .    with the successful launch of @xmath2 ( formerly known as @xmath44 )",
    ", we have a new opportunity to study @xmath1-ray emission from radio galaxies and cluster of galaxies with much improved sensitivity . as a first step ,",
    "we report here the @xmath2 discovery of @xmath1-ray emission from ngc 1275 . in @xmath452",
    ", we describe the @xmath2 @xmath1-ray observations , data reduction process , and analysis results . in @xmath453",
    "we present historical radio and contemporaneous radio observations with the umrao , ratan and the mojave program .",
    "our results are presented in the context of jet emission models in  4 .",
    "conclusions are given in @xmath455 .",
    "on june 11 , 2008 , the @xmath2 gamma - ray space telescope was successfully launched into a low - earth orbit at @xmath46 km , with an inclination angle of 25.5@xmath25 .",
    "the lat instrument on @xmath2 is described in detail in atwood et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and references therein .",
    "the lat relies on the conversion of @xmath1 rays into electron - positron pairs ; tracking of those pairs allows the determination of the direction of the incident @xmath1-ray .",
    "such a design results in a wide field of view ( @xmath47 2.4 sr ) , simultaneously available to the detector . compared to earlier @xmath1-ray missions",
    ", the lat has a large effective area ( @xmath24 8,000 @xmath48 on axis at 1 gev for the event class considered here ) , wide energy coverage from @xmath49 mev to @xmath50 gev , improved angular resolution ( a point - spread function of @xmath24 0.6@xmath25 at 1 gev for 68@xmath4 containment ) and is live about 90@xmath4 of the time .    during the first year of operations ,",
    "most of the telescope s time is being dedicated to `` survey mode '' observing , where @xmath2 points away from the earth , and nominally rocks the spacecraft axis north and south from the orbital plane to enable monitoring of the entire sky on a time scale shorter than a day or less .",
    "the whole sky is surveyed every @xmath243 hours ( or 2 orbits ) .",
    "the first light images of the @xmath1-ray sky are found in the lat official web page .",
    "we report here on the lat s initial observations of the perseus / ngc 1275 region , using data collected during the first four months of the on - going all - sky survey .",
    "the source was first detected during the launch and early operation phase ( l&eo , namely the period lasting approximately 60 days after the launch until august 3 ) . however , because the instrument configuration was not tuned for optimum performance , we concentrate our analysis on the survey data starting from 2008 august 4 .",
    "the data used here comprises all scientific data obtained between 4 august 2008 and 5 december 2008 .",
    "the interval runs from met 239557417 to 250134308 .",
    "we have applied the zenith angle cut to eliminate photons from the earth s limb , at 105@xmath25 .",
    "this is important in pointed mode observations , but also important for survey mode due to overshoots and sun avoidance maneuvers .",
    "the same zenith cut is also accounted for in exposure calculation using the lat science tool gtltcube .",
    "we use the `` diffuse '' class events ( atwood et al .",
    "2009 ) , which are those reconstructed events having the highest probability of being photons .    in the analysis presented here , we set the lower energy bound to a value of 200 mev , since the bin count for photons with energies of @xmath51 mev and lower is systematically lower than expected based on extrapolation of a reasonable function .",
    "note that theta cuts , which would eliminate events close to the edge of the field of view , are not applied in the present analysis since we still need to study the tradeoffs introduced by the cut versus those introduced by not having the cut .",
    "science tools version v9r8p3 and irfs ( instrumental response functions ) p6_v1 ( a model of the spatial distribution of photon events calibrated pre - launch ) were used throughout this paper .",
    "figure 1 shows a close - up of the @xmath2 image above 200 mev centered on the position of ngc 1275 ( ra = 49.951@xmath52 , dec = 41.512@xmath52 ) , with an image radius of the region of interest ( roi ) @xmath53 = 8 deg .",
    "the image has been smoothed with a two - dimensional gaussian function with @xmath39 = 0.2@xmath52 .",
    "the extended feature towards the upper left is the edge of the galactic diffuse emission .",
    "the brightest source is located at right ascension @xmath54 , declination @xmath55 , and coincides within the uncertainties with the direction to ngc 1275 .",
    "the positional center of the @xmath1-ray emission is only 0.05@xmath52 from the position of the ngc 1275 nucleus , well within the 95% lat error circle of 0.086@xmath56-ray emission comes from the nucleus of ngc  1275 or the perseus cluster .",
    "this will be discussed later in the discussion section @xmath454 .",
    "also there are several galaxies , ngc 1273 , 1274 , 1277 , 1278 , and 1279 in the lat error circle , but ngc 1275 is by far the brightest , is strong in the radio , and is the closest source to the @xmath1-ray peak position . ]",
    "figure 2 shows the projection of the @xmath1-ray images in low ( 0.2@xmath321 gev ) and high ( 1@xmath3210 gev ) energy bands , specifically , sliced photon count distributions projected onto a ra axis with @xmath57@xmath58 = @xmath13 2@xmath25 , centered on ngc  1275 ( black points with errors ; bin width 0.1 @xmath25 ) .",
    "the most prominent peak in the center is ngc  1275 , while the smaller peak is also seen in the east ( `` src_a '' ) .",
    "red solid lines show the best - fit model determined from the likelihood analysis described below , in which we assume two point sources ( ngc  1275 and src_a ) with the galactic and extragalactic diffuse emission overlaid .",
    "the lat has an angular resolution of @xmath59 0.6@xmath60 ( atwood et al .",
    "2009 ) , giving @xmath61 at 200 mev .",
    "the counts distributions of ngc  1275 and src_a are consistent with this distribution in low- and high - energy bands , indicating that the diffuse extended component combined with a point source for src_a does not contaminate ngc  1275/perseus , at least within current photon statistics .",
    "to study the average spectrum of ngc  1275 during the four - month observation , we use the standard maximum - likelihood spectral estimator provided with the lat science tools gtlike .",
    "this fits the data to a source model , along with models for the uniform extragalactic and structured galactic backgrounds .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , the upper left count map ( @xmath47 10@xmath25 from the ngc 1275 nucleus ) is dominated by the bright soft @xmath1-ray emission of the galactic plane .",
    "since the distribution and amount of the galactic diffuse emission itself is still a matter of debate , careful choice of the source region is important especially for relatively faint sources .",
    "we therefore made several trials by changing the roi radius from 5@xmath25 to 20@xmath25 in steps of 5 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 15 , 20@xmath25 , respectively.20@xmath25 in confused regions near the galactic plane , @xmath62 10@xmath25 for isolated high latitude regions .",
    "] we used a recent galactic diffuse model , 54_59xvarh7s , generated using galprop with the normalization free to vary in the fit .",
    "the response function used is p6_v1_diffuse .",
    "since a different choice of roi yielded essentially the same results within statistical uncertainties , we set @xmath53 = 8@xmath25 in the following analysis to minimize contamination from the galactic plane and nearby sources ( for details , see the @xmath2 lat bright @xmath1-ray source list ; abdo et al .",
    "2009 ) and to reduce computational time ; this region is large enough to contain most of the photons even at the lowest energies where the lat psf broadens . with this choice ,",
    "the only sources to be included in the modeling are ngc 1275 , src_a , and the galactic and extragalactic emission as underlying diffuse background components .",
    "we have also checked the contribution from sources outside the roi , but found it to be completely negligible .",
    "we model the continuum emission from both ngc 1275 and src_a with a single power law . the extragalactic background is assumed to have a power - law spectrum , with its spectral index and the normalization free to vary in the fit . from",
    "an unbinned gtlike fit the best fit power - law parameters for ngc  1275 are : @xmath63 or @xmath64 where only statistical errors are taken into account and the spectrum was extrapolated down to 100 mev .",
    "systematic errors for the lat are still under investigation ( bruel et al .",
    "2009 , in prep ) , but for relatively faint source like ngc  1275 , the uncertainty is dominated by statistical errors .",
    "the predicted photon counts from ngc  1275 in the roi are @xmath65 = 866.5 and test statistic ( defined as ts = 2(log @xmath66 - log @xmath67 ) , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the likelihood when the source is included or not ) is @xmath68 = 1206.6 above 200 mev , corresponding to a 35 @xmath39 detection . for the galactic diffuse background ,",
    "the normalization is 1.050@xmath130.026 and @xmath69 = 11542.8 .",
    "the near unity normalization suggests that the galactic diffuse emission estimated in the roi is in good agreement with the current galprop model .",
    "the power - law photon index of the extragalactic background is @xmath12 = 2.14@xmath130.04 with @xmath69 = 2793.2 .",
    "this spectral shape is consistent with what has been measured with @xmath31/egret ( @xmath12 = 2.10@xmath130.03 ) but the normalization determined with @xmath2 , ( 1.23@xmath130.16)@xmath710@xmath70 ph @xmath10 s@xmath11 mev@xmath11 when extrapolated to 100 mev , is about 30 @xmath4 lower than that measured with egret ( sreekumar et al . 1998 ) .",
    "although we have considered src_a , the source turned out to be weak and did not affect the analysis results presented here = 1.92@xmath130.20 with @xmath71 for src_a . ] .",

    "finally , we investigate the flux variations of ngc  1275 from august 4 to december 5 in 2008 .",
    "to this end , we accumulated spectra with a time resolution of 7 days and fit each spectrum with the same model as above . the roi radius ( @xmath53 = 8@xmath25 ) , energy range ( @xmath72 @xmath73 200 mev ) , and other screening conditions were the same as described above .",
    "since variability is @xmath74 expected for underlying background diffuse emission , we fixed the best - fit parameters as to an average values determined from the four - month integrated spectrum for the galactic / extragalactic background components .",
    "in this manner , only four parameters ( power - law photon indices and normalizations for both ngc  1275 and src_a ) are set to be free for the time - resolved spectral fits .",
    "figure 4 shows the plot of the flux ( @xmath72 @xmath73100 mev : @xmath75 ) and photon index ( @xmath76 ) versus time .",
    "it appears that the flux of ngc 1275 may decrease gradually over four months , and there are some hints of spectral evolution as well .",
    "however , the hypothesis of constancy can not be rejected , with @xmath77 = 12.2 and 12.4 for 16 degrees of freedom , for flux and photon index variations , respectively lat bright @xmath1-ray source list ( table . 6 of abdo et al .",
    "this is because they have fixed the spectral index of each source to the best fit value over the full interval to avoid large error bars in the flux estimates , whilst both flux and photon index free to vary in the fit of this paper .",
    "further long - term monitoring is thus important to confirm the variability of this source . ] .",
    "we checked that the contaminant src_a does not vary .",
    "we independently checked the light curve using gtexposure , taking a small roi radius of @xmath53 = 2@xmath25 to reduce the contamination from diffuse background and nearby sources .",
    "we assumed the spectral photon index of @xmath12 = 2.2 , and background was subtracted from nearby region of the same roi radius .",
    "the results were consistent with what has been obtained with gtlike .",
    "further long - term monitoring of this source is important .",
    "since the source is apparently variable on longer time scale , year - scale variability is naturally expected as we will discuss below .",
    "in the radio , the university of michigan radio astronomy observatory ( umrao ) have monitored 3c  84 since 1965 .",
    "the umrao variability program utilizes a 26-meter prime focus paraboloid equipped with transistor - based radiometers which operate at the central frequencies 4.8 , 8.0 , and 14.5 ghz ; the bandwidths are 560 , 760 , and 1600 mhz respectively . a typical observation consists of 8 to 16 individual measurements obtained over a 20 to 40 minute time interval .",
    "the flux scale is set by observations of cassiopeia a ( e.g. , see baars et al . 1977 ) .",
    "further details of the umrao calibration and data analysis procedures are given in aller et al .",
    "figure 5 shows a long - term light curve of 3c  84 measured at 14.5 ghz , taken by the umrao from february 1974 to december 2008 .",
    "interestingly , the radio flux density reached a maximum between 1980 and 1985 ( the @xmath34 @xmath35 era ) , and then substantially faded out after 1990 ( odea et al .",
    "1984 ; tersranta et al .",
    "2004 ) when egret was observing .",
    "this trend appears similar to the optical activities of this source ( nesterov et al .",
    "1995 ; pronik et al .",
    "furthermore , the umrao light curve shows a flare ( or a rising state ) starting in 2005 , which could be interpreted as an ejection of new jet components .",
    "in fact , the mojave ( monitoring of jets in active galactic nuclei with vlba experiments ; lister et al .",
    "2009 ) 15  ghz vlba observations of 3c84 , taken simultaneously with _ fermi _ on 2008  august  25 , show a significant brightening of the central sub - parsec - scale structure , indicating that a flare is happening in the innermost jet region ( figure  6 ) .",
    "this brightening might be connected to the @xmath1-ray activity detected .",
    "the 122  ghz instantaneous radio spectrum of 3c84 was also observed with the 600-meter ring radio telescope ratan-600 of the special astrophysical observatory , russian academy of sciences , located in zelenchukskaya , russia , on 2008  september 11 and 12 .",
    "the continuum spectrum was measured on both days quasi - simultaneously ( within several minutes ) in a transit mode at six different bands with the following central frequencies ( and frequency bandwidths ) : 0.95  ghz ( 0.03  ghz ) , 2.3  ghz ( 0.25  ghz ) , 4.8  ghz ( 0.6  ghz ) , 7.7  ghz ( 1.0  ghz ) , 11.2  ghz ( 1.4  ghz ) , 21.7  ghz ( 2.5  ghz ) .",
    "details on the method of observation , data processing , and amplitude calibration are described in kovalev et al .",
    "an average spectrum is used for the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "in the previous sections , we have reported the detection of @xmath1-ray emission from ngc  1275 during the initial sky survey with @xmath2 , and historical and contemporaneous radio observations with umrao , ratan , and mojave .",
    "although excess @xmath1-ray emission around the position of this galaxy had been previously found with @xmath34 @xmath35 , the association of the latter with ngc  1275 was ambiguous , due to the relatively poor angular resolution and low photon statistics ( strong & bignami 1983 ; see @xmath45 1 ) .",
    "the @xmath2 observations , with much improved sensitivity and angular resolution , allow us to more precisely determine the localization of the @xmath1-ray source and its possible association with ngc  1275 .",
    "more intriguing is that the source was not detected during @xmath31/egret observations over ten viewing periods ( reimer et al .",
    "the 2@xmath39 egret upper limit to the flux is @xmath37 @xmath40 3.72 @xmath710@xmath78 ph(@xmath42 mev ) @xmath10 s@xmath11 , which is about factor of seven @xmath76 than the flux measured by @xmath2/lat , and more than an order of magnitude lower than the @xmath34 @xmath35 flux ( see fig .",
    "this means the source varies on timescales shorter than years to decades , so that the emission region size @xmath79 pc .    with this simple estimate",
    ", we can provide useful constraints on whether the @xmath1-ray emission originates from a cluster or agn .",
    "although the lat error circle is still large enough to include both non - thermal agn and nonthermal cluster emission , a large fraction of the @xmath1-ray emission measured with the @xmath2 lat must originate from within a few light - years of an active region , most likely the cluster center , on the basis of the egret upper limit . since the perseus cluster is extended over @xmath80 0.5@xmath25 ( or @xmath22 radius @xmath24 0.3@xmath25 ; see @xmath45 1 ) , corresponding to hundreds of kpc , if the emission were extended on this size scale , it would not have been variable and could have been detected as an extended source with the lat above 1 gev , where the psf becomes smaller than @xmath81 .",
    "as seen in figure 2 , however , the observed count distribution is consistent with a point source .",
    "this limits the @xmath1-ray flux from the cluster formed by ( 1 ) p - p interactions of high - energy cosmic rays or by ( 2 ) particle acceleration at a large - scale shock to the flux upper limit measured with egret .",
    "( see @xmath45 1 ) .",
    "thus , the bulk of the @xmath2 emission is limited to a region of a few light years in extent .",
    "one may also suspect that the high energy @xmath1-ray emission could be related to the  cavities \" seen in the x - ray images of the perseus cluster ( fabian et al .",
    "2000 ; 2003 ) , which are likely inflated by the jet from 3c  84 .",
    "their size scale , on the order of arcminutes , is too large to account for the inferred time variability .",
    "another possibility is the @xmath1-ray flux originates from the annihilation of dark matter particles , for example , neutralino dark matter .",
    "an annihilation @xmath1-ray signal from the whole cluster would be extended and inconsistent with the @xmath2 observation . in any case , the expected flux is much smaller when a standard annihilation cross section is assumed .",
    "however , the growth of the supermassive black hole at the cluster center may produce a spike in the density profile , resulting in a much higher annihilation rate from the central region within @xmath24 0.1 pc ( e.g. , totani 2004 ; colafrancesco et al .",
    "this annihilation emission should be observed as a point source for the lat resolution , and flux modulation on the dynamical time scale ( @xmath24 4 months within 0.1 pc ) is possible .",
    "however , the continuum gamma - ray spectrum from neutralino annihilation should be strongly peaked at @xmath241@xmath3210 gev in the standard framework of particle physics , which conflicts with the observed lat spectrum ( figure 3 and figure 7 ) .",
    "the available evidence appears to be most consistent with @xmath1-ray emission arising from the pc - scale agn jet .",
    "nonthermal nuclear emission is also detected at other wavelengths .",
    "recent @xmath21 and @xmath26-@xmath27 observations with excellent angular resolution to resolve the nucleus revealed that non - thermal nucleus emission is well represented by a simple power - law function of @xmath12 = 1.65 ( churazov et al .",
    "2003 ; balmaverde et al . 2006 ; molendi & gastaldello 2009 ) , with some hints of flux variations .",
    "also , hard x - ray emission detected with @xmath33/bat is likely due to non - thermal emission from the nucleus of ngc  1275 ( ajello et al .",
    "2009 ) . in the optical , nuclear variability of ngc  1275 has been indicated in densely monitored observations since the 1960 s ( nesterov et al .",
    "1995 ; pronik et al .",
    "the source was highly variable and bright in the 1970 s ( @xmath82 @xmath47 12.0@xmath130.5 mag ) , suddenly faded in the 1980 - 90 s with @xmath82 @xmath47 13.5 mag ( ciprini et al .",
    "2008 ) , and has been gradually rising up again after 2000 . to gauge the recent optical activity of ngc  1275 ,",
    "we measured the source flux in six filter swift / uvot ( roming et al .",
    "2005 ) images from dec 2007 ( fig .",
    "7 ) using @xmath83 circular regions . additionally , our recent optical observations by mitsume ( multicolor imaging telescope for survey and monstrous explosions ; e.g. , kotani et al . 2005 ) exhibits preliminary results of @xmath82 @xmath47 12.7@xmath130.3 mag during the @xmath2/lat observation in june - sept 2008 .",
    "interestingly , it appears that the optical flux traces the historical @xmath1-ray activity from @xmath34 @xmath35 to the @xmath2 era .",
    "note , however , that care must be taken when comparing results from different telescopes due to host galaxy subtraction and different techniques to calculate photon counts ( nilsson et al . 2007 ) .",
    "figure 7 shows the overall @xmath84 sed of ngc 1275 constructed with radio to @xmath1-ray multiband data .",
    "although the archival ned ( nasa / ipac extragalactic database ) data contain host galaxies contamination in optical , the non - thermal nuclear spectrum shows two pronounced continuum components , one peaking between the optical and ir and the other in the @xmath1-ray regime . in analogy with blazars ( e.g. , kubo et al .",
    "1998 ; fossati et al . 1998 ) , the low energy component is probably due to synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons accelerated within the outflow , while compton scattering by the same electron is most likely responsible for the nonthermal x - ray and high energy @xmath1-ray component . as can be seen , the @xmath1-ray flux is comparable in apparent luminosity with the lower energy radio / optical flux . hence the overall sed appears to be similar to low frequency peaked bl lac objects ( e.g. , kubo et al .",
    "1998 ) in that the low energy peak is in the ir - optical and the high peak is in the soft gamma - rays .",
    "two low peaked bl lacs have been observed with tev gamma - rays : bl lac ( albert et al . 2007 ) and 3c 66a ( acciari et al .",
    "2009 ) and thus ngc 1275 is a potential tev source as well .",
    "we use two models to fit the sed of the nonthermal emission of ngc 1275 in figure 7 .",
    "first we consider a simple one - zone ssc model fit to the @xmath2 data and contemporaneous radio data ( blue dashed curve ; see finke et al .",
    "2008 for details ) .",
    "this model employs a jetted outflow with bulk lorentz factor @xmath85 and doppler factor @xmath86 , so that the observing angle to the jet direction is @xmath87 .",
    "the mean magnetic field in the radiating plasma is @xmath88 g , and the comoving radius of the jet emission region is 2@xmath89 cm , corresponding to a variability timescale of @xmath90 yr .",
    "the nonthermal electron distribution is assumed to be described by a broken power law with number indices ( where the electron distribution @xmath91 ) @xmath92 for @xmath93 , and index @xmath94 for @xmath95 , where @xmath1 is the electron lorentz factor in the fluid frame , and the poynting flux density is about twice the electron energy density .",
    "this simple homogeneous model provides an adequate fit the ngc  1275 data , and is consistent with mildly relativistic outflows observed in the expanding radio lobe of 3c  84 ( asada et al .",
    "an apparent discrepancy between the model and data in optical - uv emission can be accommodated by remaining host galaxy contribution as described above .    in the standard blast wave scenario",
    ", the jet protons will contain the majority of the jet s kinetic energy , and will be radiatively inefficient since they are unlikely to lose their energy without a significant observable component .",
    "if we assume they have 10 times the energy density of the electrons , the total jet power will be @xmath96 ergs s@xmath11 , which may be inconsistent with the estimated power required to inflate the lobe of 3c  84 against the pressure of the hot cluster gas , ( 0.3  1.3)@xmath710@xmath97 erg s@xmath11 ( dunn & fabian 2004 ) , although the jet power in the past could be lower than at present . with the assumption that there is one cold proton in the flow for each radiating electron , we will get a total jet power of @xmath98 ergs s@xmath11 , which is consistent to within a factor of 2 of the lobe inflation power .",
    "furthermore , in the context of bl lac and fr i unification , larger values of @xmath12 near the base of the jet are expected if ngc  1275 is a misaligned bl lac object .",
    "velocity gradients in the jet also help to resolve spectral modeling issues in bl lac objects ( georganopoulos & kazanas 2003b ; ghisellini et al .",
    "2005 ) and the apparent conflict between the subluminal vlbi apparent speeds usually measured in tev bl lacs ( e.g. piner et al . 2008 ) and the need for highly relativistic outflows required to model their tev emission .",
    "a fit to the ngc 1275 data using the decelerating flow model of georganopoulos and kazanas ( 2003b ) , which was developed to overcome these problems , is also shown in fig .",
    "7 ( blue solid curve ) . in this model ,",
    "the high - energy emission is due to synchrotron photons produced in the slower part of the flow that are compton - scattered by energetic electrons in the faster , upstream part of the flow ( georganopoulos & kazanas 2003a ) .",
    "the jet starts with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath99 and decelerates down to @xmath100 over a distance of @xmath101 cm .",
    "the cross section of the flow at the inlet has a diameter of 3@xmath7@xmath102 cm , and the magnetic field at the base is @xmath103 g. the injected power law electron distribution , @xmath104 has an index @xmath105 , and extends from @xmath106 to @xmath107 , and the particle energy density is higher than the magnetic field energy density by a factor of 13 .",
    "if the protons have 10 times the energy density of the electrons , the total jet power is @xmath108 erg s@xmath11 , which is still above the power needed to inflate the lobes . with an assumption of one proton per radiating electron , the total jet power , @xmath109 erg s@xmath11 , is consistent with this value .",
    "the blue solid curves in figure 7 represent the sed as seen at an angle @xmath110 ( approximately coincident with @xmath111 @xmath24 32@xmath25 : asada et al .",
    "models with structure jets involving decelerating flows , considered here , or a spine - sheath model ( ghisellini et al .",
    "2005 ) , make predictions for fr i radio galaxies as potential @xmath2 @xmath1-ray sources",
    ". indeed , ghisellini et al .",
    "( 2005 ) predicted that 3c  84 would be one of the strongest @xmath1-ray emitting radio galaxies above 100 mev .",
    "we have reported the discovery that the radio galaxy 3c  84,associated with ngc 1275 is a source of high - energy @xmath1 rays in the 100 mev  gev range based on data taken with the @xmath2 gamma ray space telescope between august and december 2008 .",
    "the emission is consistent with a point source centered at the nucleus of ngc 1275 .",
    "no convincing variability is evident in the fermi data , though there is a hint of a declining flux during the four - month observing period .",
    "compared with the egret flux upper limit , however , the @xmath1-ray flux measured with @xmath2 is almost an order - of - magnitude brighter and therefore implies that the ngc 1275 is varying significantly on timescales from months to years .",
    "these results limit the amount of flux that can originate from extended galaxy - cluster or dark - matter  annihilation radiation to the flux upper limit measured with egret .    associated with the @xmath1-ray observations , we also report contemporaneous and historical radio data from 3c84 .",
    "the long - term radio light curve appears to be brightening from an historical minimum at 8.0 and 14.5 ghz .",
    "core brightening during the _ fermi _ era may be related to its brighter @xmath1-ray flux state than observed with egret , but no unambiguous radio/@xmath1-ray flux correlation is evident from the historical data .",
    "two jet models were used to fit the broadband sed of the nuclear emission from ngc 1275 .",
    "a simple one - zone ssc model gives an adequate fit to the sed with a moderate lorentz factor . a decelerating jet model motivated by expectations of larger lorentz factors in bl lac",
    "/ fr 1 unification scenarios also provides a good fit to the data .    during the first year all - sky survey and beyond",
    ", we will continue to monitor the flux variations of ngc  1275 and other sources to establish the variability time scale and the fraction of @xmath1-ray emission associated with compact regions .",
    "future monitoring campaigns covering various wavebands of the electromagnetic spectrum will provide crucial data for understanding possible correlations between high- and low - energy bands and discriminating between models .",
