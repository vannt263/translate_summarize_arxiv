    "we correct our measurements of hadronic ,  and   events for the effect of interference between initial- and final - state radiation , as in our previous publications , and also use the same treatment of the four - fermion contribution to the two - fermion final states . because of ambiguities arising from the @xmath55-channel contribution , for the  final state the acceptance is defined in terms of the angle @xmath56 of the electron or positron with respect to the electron beam direction and the acollinearity angle @xmath57 between the electron and positron .",

    "measurements of fermion - pair production up to 183  gev have shown very good agreement with standard model expectations  @xcite . here",
    "we repeat our measurement of the electromagnetic coupling constant ( @xmath51 ) including the higher energy data . including data at 189",
    "gev also allows us to extend the searches for new physics presented in  @xcite .",

    "matching between tracks and clusters has been studied using events passing all selection cuts , except that only one of the three highest energy clusters has an associated track .",
    "these are expected to be mainly @xmath74 final states where one electron and the photon lie within the acceptance and @xmath75 final states where one photon has converted in the detector , with small contributions from other final states .",
    "an excess of such events was seen in data compared with monte carlo expectation ; this excess amounted to approximately 0.8% of the number of events passing all cuts .",
    "roughly half the excess is concentrated in regions of @xmath61 near the anode planes of the central jet chamber , and arises from track reconstruction problems in this region .",
    "the other half could arise from track reconstruction problems , or could arise from problems modelling @xmath74 or @xmath75 events .",
    "for each acceptance region we take half the difference between data and monte carlo as a correction to the efficiency to account for the loss of tracks near jet chamber anode planes , and assign the other half as a systematic error associated with track requirements .",

    "these have been assessed by comparing measurements of @xmath56 in the electromagnetic calorimeter with those in the central tracking chambers and the muon chambers .",
    "these studies indicate a possible bias in the @xmath56 reconstruction of electromagnetic clusters of around 1  mrad in the endcap region of the detector . the effect of the observed biases on the acceptance was calculated using monte carlo events , and assigned as a systematic error associated with the acceptance correction .",

    "systematic errors on the asymmetry measurement arise from the effects of @xmath56 mismeasurement , charge misassigment and background and efficiency corrections , and amount to 0.005 . even with the current statistics this is only half of the statistical error .",

    "the error due to any remaining cosmic background in the muon pairs was estimated by varying the time - of - flight or vertex cuts by amounts determined from the resolution in the respective variables .",

    "the numbers of events in data and monte carlo were compared for a region enriched in a particular background , and the difference , or its statistical error , used to estimate the systematic error from that background source .",
    "for example , the  background in the muon pairs was studied using the distribution of visible energy ; the bhabha background in the tau pairs was estimated using distributions of total visible energy with the cuts on energy relaxed .",

    "these couplings are given by the term @xmath112 of the superpotential  @xcite , where the indices @xmath113 denote the family of the particles involved , @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the su(2 ) doublet lepton superfields and @xmath116 denotes an antilepton singlet superfield .",
    "the couplings @xmath117 are non - vanishing only for @xmath118 , so at least two different generations of leptons are coupled in purely leptonic vertices .",
    "sneutrinos may contribute to leptonic cross - sections via both @xmath72-channel and @xmath55-channel diagrams , depending on the type of sneutrino and the final state considered .",
    "processes involving an @xmath72-channel diagram lead to resonant behaviour when the centre - of - mass energy is near the sneutrino mass , and hence more stringent limits can be set than for processes involving only @xmath55-channel diagrams . here",
    "we consider two typical cases involving an @xmath72-channel diagram :    * the presence of a @xmath119 which interacts via the coupling @xmath120 giving rise to a change in the cross - section via an @xmath72-channel and a @xmath55-channel process ; the limits obtained for this case could equally apply to a @xmath121 interacting via the coupling @xmath122 ; * a @xmath123 with the couplings @xmath120 and @xmath124 both different from zero . in the analysis",
    "both couplings are assumed to be of equal size .",
    "such a scenario gives rise to a modified cross - section due to an @xmath72-channel exchange of the sneutrino .    to calculate the differential cross - sections for these processes we use the formulae in  @xcite , taking radiative corrections into account as in the contact interaction analysis .    in each case",
    "we use a maximum likelihood fit of the model prediction to data and extract 95% confidence level limits on the coupling as a function of the sneutrino mass .",
    "we include in the fits the data at 189  gev presented here and the data at 130183  gev presented in  @xcite .",
    "we use the full @xmath64 distributions as described in  @xcite in order to improve the sensitivity at values of sneutrino mass between the centre - of - mass energies of lep .",
    "the inclusion of asymmetry values has a very small effect on the limits , therefore we present only limits excluding asymmetry measurements in order not to lose generality .    the limits on @xmath120 derived from the  data are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ee_limits ] .",
    "they are in the range for @xmath125  gev . for masses above 200  gev there is no @xmath72-channel contribution , and the limits rise to 0.16 at 300  gev .",

    "these limits are valid for sneutrino widths of 1  gev or less .",

    "our results place limits on the couplings for masses above 100  gev .",
    "in nature there are two fundamental scales which differ by many orders of magnitude , the ratio between the planck scale ( @xmath129  gev ) and the electroweak scale ( @xmath130  gev ) being about @xmath131 .",
    "the lack of explanation of this fact is known as the ` hierarchy problem ' .",
    "recently it has been pointed out that the quantum - gravity scale could be as low as the electroweak scale with gravitons propagating in a compactified higher dimensional space  @xcite , while other standard model particles are confined to the usual @xmath132 space - time dimensions .",
    "according to this theory the planck mass in @xmath133 dimensions ( @xmath134 ) is chosen to be the electroweak scale , so that the hierarchy problem is solved by definition .",
    "the planck mass in the usual 4 space - time dimensions is given by @xmath135 where @xmath0 is the compactification radius of the extra dimensions .",
    "gravitons may contribute to two - fermion production via the process @xmath136 .",
    "although the contribution from a single graviton state is very small compared with the standard model contribution , the very large number of possible excitation modes in the extra dimensions might lead to a measurable effect  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of virtual graviton exchange processes in the context of collider experiments is described in  @xcite .",
    "the differential cross - section for the production of fermion pairs with the inclusion of virtual graviton exchange can be written generally as @xmath137   + c({\\mbox{$\\cos \\theta$ } } ) \\left[\\frac{\\lambda}{m_{\\rm s}^4}\\right]^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the production polar angle of the fermion with respect to the e@xmath138 beam direction and @xmath139 is a mass scale parameter of the order of @xmath134 .",

    "in contrast to graviton production , @xmath145 , the dependence of the fermion - pair cross - section on the number of extra dimensions is weak and is included in @xmath144 .",
    "here we consider the cases @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "although the functional form of the new interaction is similar to that of the contact interaction  @xcite , the differential cross - section for the new interaction includes terms proportional to @xmath148 or @xmath149 .",
    "the mass scale dependence of the amplitude of the new interaction is 1/(mass scale)@xmath150 , whereas that of the ordinary contact interaction is 1/(mass scale)@xmath151 .",
    "the first term in equation  ( [ eq - grav ] ) is the standard model prediction , the second term is the interference term and the third is the new interaction term .",

    ", we performed a binned maximum likelihood fit to angular distributions at the two centre - of - mass energies simultaneously , in a similar manner to the contact interaction analysis in section  [ sec : ci ] . in order to fit the differential cross - section equation  ( [ eq - grav ] ) to the data ,",
    "a first - order photon radiation correction  @xcite was applied to the terms @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "zfitter was used to calculate the standard model term @xmath154 . the theoretical cross - section as a function of @xmath155",
    "was then converted to the expected number of events in each of the @xmath156 bins , taking into account the event selection efficiency , background , feedthrough of low @xmath157 events and the effect of interference between initial- and final - state photon radiation .",
    "the likelihood was calculated from the poisson probability for the observed number of events .",
    "additional gaussian smearing was taken into account in the likelihood in order to allow the overall normalization error to vary within the systematic errors discussed in section  [ sec : data ] .",
    "we assigned a theoretical error of 0.6% to the standard model prediction of zfitter , as discussed in section  [ sec : sm ] .",
    "we derived the 95% confidence level lower limits on @xmath139 from the values of @xmath158 corresponding to an increase in the negative log likelihood of 1.92 with respect to the minimum found in the @xmath158 region considered .",

    "<S> cross - sections and angular distributions for hadronic and lepton pair final states in  collisions at a centre - of - mass energy near 189  gev , measured with the opal detector at lep , are presented and compared with the predictions of the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> the results are used to measure the energy dependence of the electromagnetic coupling constant , and to place limits on new physics as described by four - fermion contact interactions or by the exchange of a new heavy particle such as a sneutrino in supersymmetric theories with @xmath0-parity violation . a search for the indirect effects of the gravitational interaction in extra dimensions on the  and  final states is also presented .    </S>",
