    "high momenta introduce both noise and @xmath5 discretization errors into lattice simulations making calculations of semileptonic form factors that extend over a wide range in @xmath6 a challenging task .",
    "we have carried out exploratory simulations to investigate whether anisotropic lattices can help with the signal - to - noise problem .",
    "we study two- and three - point correlators involving finite momentum hadrons on both anisotropic and isotropic lattices with comparable coarse spatial lattice spacings . working with identical source operators and smearings on the initial time slices ,",
    "we compare the quality of signals that can be extracted at later times .",
    "we find that it is considerably easier to obtain good signals on anisotropic lattices at higher momenta ( e.g. once momenta reach ( 1,1,1)@xmath7 and beyond ) .",
    "the gauge actions on the isotropic and anisotropic lattices correspond to symanzik improved actions and include both plaquettes @xmath8 and rectangles @xmath9 @xcite .",

    "we have not attempted to tune quark masses very carefully .",
    "we work at one light quark mass slightly heavier than the strange quark .",

    "we show examples of extracted finite momentum energies from the pion and rho channels at momentum ( 1,1,1)@xmath28 . since identical signals are being created on the initial time slices , effective mass plateaus are of the same length in physical units on the isotropic and anisotropic lattices .",
    "however , on the anisotropic lattice the region where the signal is still appreciably above the noise is being probed much more frequently .",
    "it is then easier to recognize the onset of a plateau and extract fitted energies with confidence .",
    "semi - leptonic form factors for pseudoscalar to pseudoscalar decays are defined through the hadronic matrix element of the heavy - light vector current @xmath29 , @xmath30 in lattice simulations the above matrix element can be obtained from ratios of three- and two - point correlators .",

    "these tests will also be summarized in a forthcoming paper together with the form factor results @xcite . there",
    "we will go into details of weighing the additional costs associated with anisotropic simulations against the advantages described here ."
