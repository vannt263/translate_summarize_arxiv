    "<S> we map the complex electric fields associated with the scattering of surface plasmon polaritons by single sub - wavelength holes of different sizes in thick gold films . we identify and quantify the different modes associated with this event , including a radial surface wave with an angularly isotropic amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> this wave is shown to arise from the out - of - plane electric dipole induced in the hole , and we quantify the corresponding polarizability , which is in excellent agreement with electromagnetic theory . </S>",
    "<S> time - resolved measurements reveal a time - delay of @xmath0fs between the surface plasmon polariton and the radial wave , which we attribute to the interaction with a broad hole resonance .    </S>",
    "<S> the interaction of light , and in particular of surface waves such as surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) , with sub - wavelength holes in metallic films leads to phenomena such as extraordinary optical transmission ( eot )  @xcite and negative index metamaterials  @xcite . in this context , </S>",
    "<S> sub - wavelength holes are important in diverse fields of research , such as nanophotonics , enhanced nonlinear optics , and biosensing , and consequently , with a few notable exceptions  @xcite , experiments focus on the macroscopic consequences of the light - hole interactions . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , much theoretical work has been devoted to their understanding from a microscopic viewpoint  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that is , while the models intrinsically consider scattering of light and ssps from sub - wavelength defects , often in terms of their polarizabilities , most experimental studies address collective response features such as eot spectra and their dependence on changes in sample geometry , film thickness  @xcite , and hole shape  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in essence , a detailed investigation of the dynamics of plasmonic scattering remains incomplete .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we present a systematic experimental study of the scattering of spps from individual circular sub - wavelength holes of different diameters in optically thick gold films . </S>",
    "<S> we use phase - sensitive time - resolved near - field optical observations to measure the plasmonic scattering on a nanometer length- and femtosecond time - scale , determining the angularly resolved scattering amplitude for sub - wavelength holes of different sizes and quantifying the temporal dynamics of the scattering events . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these results can be explained in terms of the polarizability of the hole , in excellent agreement with electromagnetic theory .    </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the scattering from individual holes , with diameters ranging from 50 to 980 nm , milled with a focused ion beam into a 200 nm thick gold film deposited on a glass substrate . </S>",
    "<S> we launch spps on the air - gold interface by illuminating a slit in the film with either 150 femtosecond fwhm pulses or a continuous wave laser source centered at a wavelength of 1550 nm . at this wavelength , a waveguide mode is supported by holes with diameters above 760 nm . </S>",
    "<S> these spps are efficiently directed towards the hole by a bragg grating that is milled into the film on the opposite side of the slit  @xcite , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sample ] .     </S>",
    "<S> +    we measure the complex electric field of this system , at a height of 20 nm , with near field microscopy  @xcite .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : example ] we present typical experimental results for a hole with a diameter of 875 nm .     </S>",
    "<S> +    we observe fringes in the amplitude that originate from the interference of the forward propagating spp with the scattered waves . here , the dark vertical stripes near 5 and 8 @xmath1 m are attributed to geometrical imperfections in the area of the launching slit . </S>",
    "<S> the salient features of the data are reproduced by first - principle calculations [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : example](b ) ] performed using a modified version of a model presented elsewhere  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this method , which involves a rigorous expansion of maxwell s equations , both in terms of plane waves on either side of the film and in cylindrical waves inside the hole , is used to calculate the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the hole , which are in turn used to obtain the scattered fields  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the different waves present in the scattering event are readily identifiable in _ </S>",
    "<S> k_-space  @xcite after a fourier transform [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : example](c ) ] . in _ k_-space , </S>",
    "<S> signatures of the forward propagating spp , evidenced by the peak near @xmath2 , and the scattered wave , which emerges as a circular pattern , are readily separable . </S>",
    "<S> these signatures are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : example](d ) , in which both the data ( thick shaded curves ) and the fits for the different surface waves ( thin dark curves ) are presented . </S>",
    "<S> the distributions of both waves peak around a wave vector @xmath3 @xmath1m@xmath4 , which is in good agreement with the theoretical value of @xmath5m@xmath4 , obtained from the dielectric constant of gold at 1550 nm , @xmath6  @xcite .    in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : example](d ) , we show the angular dependence of the in - plane electric field distribution . here </S>",
    "<S> , the outer curve represents the total integrated field amplitude while the inner curve represents the integrated amplitude that we can attribute to the surface waves . </S>",
    "<S> we find these curves by integrating up to @xmath7 @xmath1m@xmath4 under the data and fits , respectively , in each direction ( main part of the figure ) .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we observe no angular dependence of the radial mode and attribute the slight left - right asymmetry found in our measurements to either a slightly asymmetric hole or near - field tip . </S>",
    "<S> second , for this relatively large hole the amplitude content of the radial wave is about 7@xmath8 of the amplitude of the forward propagating spp . as we show below ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : size ] ) , for an 875 nm hole @xmath9 of the forward propagating spp amplitude is contained in the incident beam , and hence the amplitude of the radial wave is @xmath10 that of the _ incident _ spp . note that our incident gaussian beam is @xmath11 m width , which is larger than the hole ( see  @xcite for a discussion on the scattering cross section of the hole . finally , from this data we can also estimate that approximately half of the radially scattered field amplitude is in the surface modes . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining half of the radial fields have in - plane wave vectors that are smaller than @xmath12 @xmath1m@xmath4 , corresponding to radiative modes of light , which propagate upward , away from the metal surface . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , these are seen as the regions of non - zero amplitude within the surface wave circle in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : example](c ) , or in the difference between the inner and outer curves ( other than near @xmath13 ) in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : example](d ) .    in order to determine the nature of the observed scattered field , we consider its asymptotic form  @xcite @xmath14 where the azimuthal scattering amplitude @xmath15 is given for excitation by a spp that travels along the @xmath16 direction . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath17 is the in - plane radial distance to the hole center , @xmath18 is the height above the film surface , @xmath19 is the out - of - plane component of the spp wave vector , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are out - of - plane and in - plane unit vectors , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the in- and out - of plane electric dipoles , and @xmath24 is the in - plane magnetic dipole of the hole . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the isotropic nature of the detected scattered field [ inset to fig .  [ fig : example](d ) ] suggests that we are mostly sensitive to the contribution from @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> this is not entirely unexpected since the contributions of other dipole components peak near @xmath25 and @xmath26 and are therefore hard to separate from the incident spp field . </S>",
    "<S> however , we note that to accurately reproduce the field in all directions [ fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : example](b ) ] the fields that arise due to @xmath24 , as well as those due to @xmath23 , are required  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we image the @xmath23 dependent electric field by filtering out the forward propagating spp mode in _ </S>",
    "<S> k_-space  and then fourier transforming back to real - space . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : radial ] we show this field , both near @xmath27 where only a contribution from @xmath23 is expected , and in a 20 @xmath1m@xmath28 area around the hole ( inset ) .     fit . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the two - dimensional image of the real part of the electric field , and the arrow indicates the line along which the data shown in the main part of the figure is taken.,title=\"fig:\",width=313 ] +    a fit of the form @xmath29 reproduces the experimental data with @xmath30 @xmath1m@xmath4 and @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the measured amplitude damping is in excellent agreement with the @xmath32 behavior predicted for circular waves by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : asympte ] ) , as required for energy conservation for radial propagation on a plane . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy between the data and fit close to the hole may be indicative of the presence of creeping waves , which can have substantial amplitudes at short distances  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can also use eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : asympte ] ) to express the ratio of the scattered field to the incident field for @xmath33 in terms of the electric polarizability @xmath34 hence , we measure @xmath35 m@xmath36 , which is larger than , but comparable to , the value @xmath37 m@xmath36 calculated for a hole in a perfectly conducting film  @xcite .    in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : temporal ] we present the temporal dynamics of plasmonic scattering , showing the amplitudes of both the forward and scattered radial modes as a function of time .    </S>",
    "<S> fs.,title=\"fig:\",width=313 ] +    the forward amplitude is averaged over a range of @xmath38 while the scattered amplitude is averaged over a similar range in the transverse directions ( @xmath39 ) to ensure no overlap between the modes . </S>",
    "<S> both amplitudes are normalized to the peak of the forward propagating spp , and the second peak of the double peak results from spps that are initially launched backward and subsequently reflect from the bragg grating towards the hole  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most strikingly , we observe that the radial wave peaks one time - step _ after _ the forward propagating spp : there is a time - delay between the forward propagating spp pulse and the radial pulse resulting from the plasmonic scattering . by averaging over the time - delay that we measure between incident spp and the scattered wave , in all available directions , we quantify this shift as @xmath40fs . while the frequency dependence of the polarizability of the hole alone results in a shift only a few fs , it is able to explain the observed shift when combined with a modestly chirped incident pulse . </S>",
    "<S> that is , since the different plane waves that form our pulse scatter from the hole with different amplitudes and phases , their reconstitution into a beam results in the observed time shift . </S>",
    "<S> this shift , then , represents a first measurement of the complex spectral response of an individual hole .    </S>",
    "<S> we study the effect of hole size on the plasmonic scattering for hole sizes ranging from 50 to 980 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the results are summarized in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : size ] .     </S>",
    "<S> ( and hence the calculated scattered amplitude ) . </S>",
    "<S> inset : fraction of field contained in the forward propagating spp peak , normalized to unity for a featureless film , as a function of hole size . </S>",
    "<S> the vertical dashed lines show the cutoff of the lowest - order guided mode in a deep hole for 1550 nm light.,title=\"fig:\",width=313 ] +    the inset depicts the fraction of the field amplitude that is contained in the forward propagating spp mode , which we normalize to the field on films without a hole . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , less energy is found in this plasmonic wave as the hole size increases and hence scatters more energy .    </S>",
    "<S> the main part of fig .  [ fig : size ] depicts the dependence of the scattered field amplitude of the radial wave normalized to that of the forward plasmon field ( symbols ) on the hole diameter , @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence is accurately reproduced by the calculated electric polarizability of the hole ( curve )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an offset of 0.017 is present in the data ( and added in the calculations ) due to measurement noise , and represents a signal - to - noise ratio of about 50 to 1 , while the error bar is mainly indicative of the asymmetry of our measurements . for the smaller holes , well below the cutoff , the field amplitude increases as @xmath42 , where the divergence from a perfect dipolar behavior is due to the finite size of the hole and the film thickness . as the hole size increases , and </S>",
    "<S> in particular once the cutoff is reached and waveguide modes in the hole become accessible , the scattered amplitude begins to saturate . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this behavior to an increase in energy flow through the hole  @xcite . finally , we note that the scattered amplitude peaks at about 10@xmath8 of the forward propagating spp amplitude .    to summarize , we have captured the near - field interplay between the waves associated with plasmon scattering from sub - wavelength holes and mapped both their dependence on hole size and their temporal dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we show that both the hole size dependent amplitude and the time - delay of the scattered mode can be understood in terms of the calculated polarizability of the hole . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide a comprehensive understanding of hole - plasmon scattering and should , in the future , allow for the optimization of the interaction between holes . consequently , the geometric properties of hole arrangements can be tuned to create electromagnetic hot spots . </S>",
    "<S> these can be used to , for example , enhance emission from dye molecules , address individual quantum emitters , or create near field distributions for sensing or imaging purposes . </S>",
    "<S> hence , these results have implications for a broad range of nanoplasmonic applications . </S>"
