    "although they originally come from different research fields and seem apparently to be very different phenomena , cut - off and escape behaviors have been related at the level of hitting times for birth and death chains on the line ( see @xcite ) .",
    "cut - off behavior refers to the famous cut - off phenomenon first discovered and studied by aldous and diaconis in the 80 s ( see @xcite ) , which is characterized by an almost deterministic asymptotical abrupt convergence to equilibrium for families of markov processes . in opposition , escape behavior is usually associated to the exit from metastability for a system trapped in local minimum of the energy profile . in that case , the transition to equilibrium occurs at `` unpredictable '' exponential times ( see @xcite ) .",

    "are characterized by their distinct hitting - time behavior .",
    "it is shown that , under suitable drift hypotheses , the chains exhibit both cut - off behavior toward zero and escape behavior for excursions in the opposite direction . furthermore ,",
    "as the evolutions are reversible , the law of the final escape trajectory coincides with the time reverse of the law of cut - off paths . + in the present work , we extend this study to birth - and - death chains on trees with drift toward the root of the tree .",
    "our chains are the discrete time counterpart of the birth - and - death processes studied by martnez and ycart in  @xcite . under a `` uniform '' drift condition",
    ", they prove that hitting times of zero starting from any state @xmath0 ( denoted by @xmath1 ) exhibit cut - off at mean times when @xmath0 goes to infinity ( theorem 5.1 in  @xcite ) .",
    "their drift condition is expressed as an exponential decaying tail of the invariant probability measure @xmath2 , in the sense that , for all @xmath0 , the quantity @xmath3 is uniformly bounded by some @xmath4 . in comparison ,",
    "our drift condition concerns only the branch which contains the state @xmath0 ( see formulas and ) , and we allow the upper bound @xmath5 to go to infinity , as long as remains valid ( see section [ ssect : drift ] ) . with this assumption",
