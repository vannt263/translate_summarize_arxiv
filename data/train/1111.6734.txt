    "being one of the most intriguing manifestations of a transport phenomenon that is sensitive to spin and topology , the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) @xcite is at the focus of considerable theoretical and experimental efforts .",
    "the interest in spin sensitive phenomena is linked to the emerging field of spintronics @xcite , which offers an alternative to conventional charge - based electronics .",
    "the interest in the effects of topological features of bands on transport properties is linked to the role that these effects play in systems such as topological insulators and quantum hall systems @xcite .",
    "the ahe is described phenomenologically as transverse resistivity @xmath5 or transverse conductivity @xmath6 linked to the intrinsic magnetization @xmath7 of a conductor .",
    "various models have been proposed : ( a ) the extrinsic model relates the ahe to antisymmetric scattering processes and it provides that @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the component of magnetization perpendicular to the film . the linear term in resistivity of @xmath2 is attributed to skew scattering @xcite and it is expected to dominate in high conductivity regime ( @xmath11 ) . the quadratic term is attributed to side jumps @xcite and it is expected to dominate in the good conductivity regime ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "( b ) the intrinsic model known also as the karplus - luttinger model ( k - l ) @xcite or berry phase model attributes the ahe to intrinsic topological properties of the band @xcite . according to this model @xmath13 and it is expected to dominate in the same regime as the side jump mechanism . in the poor conductivity regime ( @xmath14 ) a universal behavior @xmath15 has been observed experimentally @xcite ; however , a theoretical understanding is still lacking .",
    "interestingly , a similar scaling is predicted for metals in the limit of strong scattering due to finite - lifetime disorder broadening @xcite , and within a microscopic model accounting for fluctuations of local orbital energies @xcite .",
    "srruo@xmath1 has played a pivotal role in the study of the ahe and numerous attempts have been made to elucidate its complicated behavior .",
    "berry phase calculations which assume a temperature - dependent exchange gap that closes at @xmath4 seemed to describe the data reasonably @xcite . however , a test of this scenario that focused on the vanishing point of the ahe found that it vanishes for a given film ( whose resistivity and magnetization were varied by field ) at a specific resistivity , and not at a specific magnetization as one may expect from a scenario which attributes the vanishing signal of the ahe to the berry phase contribution at a particular exchange splitting @xcite .",
    "mid infrared measurements suggest the applicability of the berry phase scenario at energies above 200 mev while the @xmath16 limit is dominated by extrinsic scattering mechanisms @xcite .",
    "by using srruo@xmath1 films with a wide range of thicknesses that vary considerably in the temperature - dependence of their resistivity , we provide a compelling piece of evidence that resistivity , _ irrespective of its sources or nature ( elastic or inelastic ) _ , determines the ahe of srruo@xmath1 in the entire ferromagnetic phase .",
    "this observation strongly suggests that changes in berry phase due to assumed temperature - dependent exchange splitting can not explain the complicated temperature dependence of the ahe .",
    "we show that the side jumps mechanism combined with the karplus - luttinger ( berry phase ) mechanism that takes into account the scattering time may explain the observed behavior .    ) of 8 films vs temperature .",

    "our samples are epitaxial thin films of srruo@xmath1 grown on slightly miscut ( @xmath19 ) substrates of srtio@xmath20 by reactive electron beam evaporation .",
    "the films are untwinned orthorhombic single - crystals , with lattice parameters of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the films were patterned to allow transverse and longitudinal resistivity measurements , which were performed with a quantum design ppms-9 .",
    "the films exhibit exceptionally high resistivity ratio ( up to 90 ) indicative of their high quality .",
    "the thinnest films ( @xmath24 ) exhibit lower resistivity ratio ( @xmath25 ) which is still very high considering the enhanced surface scattering",
    ". magnetic characterization of the films was performed using a quantum design squid magnetometer ( mpms ) .",
    "magnetic films may exhibit ahe if their magnetization has a component perpendicular to the film plane .",
    "as shape anisotropy favors in - plane magnetization , in many cases a perpendicular field should be applied in order to tilt the magnetization out of the plane .",
    "this may complicate the analysis since the applied field also induces ordinary hall effect ( ohe ) .",
    "srruo@xmath1 films exhibit intrinsic uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy with an easy axis which varies with temperature between  45 degrees to the normal at @xmath4 to  30 degrees at 2 k @xcite .",
    "moreover , the remanent magnetization is stable and spontaneous breakdown into magnetic domains occurs only a few degrees below @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "these features enable direct measurement of zero field ( remanent ) antisymmetric transverse resistivity which can be fully attributed to ahe , @xmath17 .    ) of the 8 films presented in fig.@xmath26 , vs temperature .",
    "( b ) @xmath2 from fig.@xmath26(b ) vs resistivity ( @xmath27 ) . ]",
    "@xmath28(a ) shows temperature dependence of @xmath17 of 8 different samples . to extract @xmath2 based on eq . 1 ( see fig .  [ layout1](b ) ) , we divide @xmath17 by @xmath18 ( shown in the inset ) .",
    "we note that for the thickness range of our samples , @xmath18 is practically identical except for small deviations related to thickness - dependent @xmath4 .",
    "this is expected as thickness - induced changes in magnetic properties were reported for films with thickness lower than 6 nm @xcite .",
    "we note that while @xmath2 of the various samples has general common features , the variations are considerable . in particular we note differences in the values of @xmath2 at 2 k , in the location of the negative peak and in the temperature at which @xmath2 changes its sign .",
    "the large spread in @xmath2 seems to correlate with changes in the resistivity of the films , strongly affected by film thickness ( see fig .",
    "@xmath29(a ) ) .",
    "however , as seen in fig .",
    "@xmath29(b ) , the extracted @xmath30 does not scale with @xmath27 .",
    "in particular , we note that the resistivity at which @xmath30 changes its sign ( @xmath31 ) varies between 105 @xmath32 for a 50 nm thick sample to 202 @xmath32 for a 6 nm thick sample .",
    "does this observation exclude the scenario that @xmath30 is determined by @xmath27 in the entire ferromagnetic phase ? - not necessarily .",
    "@xmath33 shows that @xmath34 , defined as @xmath2 normalized by its maximum absolute value , does scale with @xmath35 , defined as @xmath27 normalized by @xmath31 .",
    "the scaling function has a quadratic dependence on @xmath36 in the low resistivity regime ( see inset ) and it reaches its negative peak for all samples at @xmath37 .",
    "a possible explanation for the striking scaling is that @xmath30 is determined by @xmath27 and that it _ does _ vanish at the same intrinsic resistivity @xmath38 for all samples , consistent with a previous report @xcite ; however , there is a multiplicative factor @xmath39 between the nominal resistivity and the intrinsic resistivity , @xmath40 .",
    "a trivial source for @xmath39 is uncertainty in film thickness and in geometrical factors of the pattern .",
    "however , these sources alone can not account for the observed variations of order 2 .",
    "another potential source is dead layers @xcite whose existence may affect considerably the calculated resistivity of ultrathin films . assuming a dead layer of thickness @xmath41",
    ", we would expect @xmath42 and a linear dependence between @xmath43 and @xmath44 , as observed in the inset of fig .",
    "the linear fit is consistent with a dead layer scenario with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the dead layer scenario also implies that the resistivity of the various samples at high temperatures is not different ( as suggested by fig .",
    "@xmath29(a ) ) but quite similar ( fig .",
    "@xmath45 ) .",
    "as the main difference between the films is in their thickness , the result supports the dead layer scenario as it is expected that at high temperatures , where the mean free path is small and bulk scattering is dominant , the resistivity of our films would be similar .",
    "normalized by its absolute maximum value ( @xmath48 ) vs @xmath27 normalized by its value when @xmath2 changes its sign ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "inset : @xmath48 vs @xmath49 . ]    ) vs temperature .",
    "inset : film thickness ( d ) divided by its resistivity when @xmath2 changes its sign ( @xmath31 ) vs film thickness ( d ) . ]",
    "the dead layer scenario implies the need to normalize @xmath2 ; however , its division by @xmath39 does not scale the data along the _ y _ axis .",
    "therefore , the normalization of @xmath2 with its maximum absolute value merely indicates that for all films there is a single @xmath50 function up to a multiplicative factor .",
    "we note that the scaling is obtained for films that vary considerably in their thickness and residual resistivity ; namely the same value of @xmath30 is obtained for very different values of @xmath10 and for very different contributions to @xmath27 .",
    "thus for instance , @xmath30 attains its maximum value at @xmath51=0.47 for the 6 nm thick film and at @xmath51=0.63 for the 90 nm thick film . at this temperature",
    "the magnetization is 84 percent ( 77 percent ) of its low temperature value for the thin thick ) film and the resistivity is 2 times ( 32 times ) larger than its low temperature value .",
    "therefore , point defects , surface scattering , magnons and phonons have very different weights in the two cases .",
    "the low temperature dependence of r@xmath52 on @xmath3 is consistent with side jumps mechanism @xcite and with the karplus - luttinger ( k - l ) or berry phase mechanism @xcite .",
    "however , whereas side jumps can explain the scaling with @xmath27 due to its insensitivity to the scattering potential , it can not explain the non monotonic temperature dependence which includes a sign change at higher temperatures .",
    "on the other hand , attributing the non monotonic temperature dependence to k - l mechanism with temperature dependent exchange gap as suggested previously @xcite , yields @xmath53 with a complicated dependence of @xmath54 on @xmath55 which is inconsistent with the scaling which assumes linear dependence on @xmath10 .    we now show that a combination of the side jumps mechanism and the k - l mechanism which considers the effect of scattering rate and its temperature dependence ( without assuming any change in the band structure ) is a possible scenario .",
    "a consideration of the scattering rate ( @xmath56 ) effect on the transverse conductivity in the k - l mechanism is required in moderately good conductors , where @xmath57 is not negligible compared to the inter - band gap .",
    "the leading correction yields a decrease of @xmath54 as the resistivity increases , and thus a possible non - monotonic behavior of @xmath0 .",
    "accounting for a finite @xmath58 , the k - l contribution to the ahe resistivity from kubo s formula @xcite becomes @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the crystal volume , @xmath61 is the quasi - momentum @xmath62 are band indices associated with the eigenvalues of the perfect crystal hamiltonian , @xmath63 , @xmath64 are the velocity operators , and @xmath65 is the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "this contribution accounts only for the intrinsic part of the ahe , i.e. ignores the corrections to the scattering processes due to spin - orbit interaction .     as a function of resistivity @xmath27 for a thick film ( 500  ) .",
    "the dashed line is a fit to eq .",
    "we consider a model in which the main contribution to the sum in eq .",
    "[ eqrhoxy ] is due to two bands denoted as 1,2 , where the fermi level crosses the upper band while the lower band is fully occupied .",
    "we further assume that the dominant contribution arises from states with quasi - momentum in a set denoted as @xmath66 , and that the energy gap for @xmath67 between non - occupied states in the upper level and occupied states in the lower level is approximately independent of quasi - momentum and takes the characteristic value of @xmath68 . under these assumptions ,",
    "we obtain @xmath69 where @xmath70 is defined as @xmath71 which can be associated with a berry s phase @xcite . since @xmath70 is odd under time - reversal and hence purely imaginary , we get @xmath72 considering spin orbit interaction ( soi ) , a is expected to be proportional to @xmath10 @xcite ; namely , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a constant .",
    "previous reports indicate that the band structure in srruo@xmath75 is temperature independent @xcite , thus , ferromagnetism in srruo@xmath75 should be described in the local band model @xcite . therefore considering eqs . 5 and 6 and preforming averaging yield : @xmath76 where @xmath10 is the averaged magnetization in the sample .",
    "finally , we note that within the same level of approximation ( i.e. , leading order in the scattering potential ) , the side jumps contribution is additive to the k - l term @xcite .",
    "thus , the ahe coefficient ( r@xmath52 ) is given by a sum of the two contributions : @xmath77 the first term is the k - l term ( with all the constants and the minus sign included in @xmath78 ) , and the second term is the side jumps contribution . as @xmath78 , @xmath68 and @xmath79 are merely associated with the band structure they are assumed to be constants .",
    "@xmath56 is assumed to be , as usual , proportional to @xmath27 and the proportionality factor is estimated based on band calculations @xcite .",
    "thus , the right hand side in eq .",
    "8 is a function of @xmath27 alone .",
    "@xmath80 shows a fit of our data using eq .",
    "8 where the parameter c is limited to an interval which corresponds to a reasonable range of side jumps ( 0.1 - 10   @xcite ) .",
    "we obtain a good fit for side jumps in the range of 1 - 10  , and @xmath68 in the range of 0.07 - 0.2 ev .",
    "the value of @xmath68 is in good agreement with the characteristic energy at which im(@xmath54 ) has a peak , measured in the infrared regime for the low temperature limit @xcite .",
    "the fit presented in fig .",
    "@xmath80 is for a side jump @xmath81 4    and @xmath68 @xmath81 0.13 ev . the fact that a similar temperature dependence of r@xmath52 is observed for other systems @xcite suggests that this scenario is relevant to other materials as well .",
    "the scaling of @xmath17 data with @xmath27 in sro films implies that the ahe coefficient is determined by the total resistivity irrespective of the relative contributions of different scattering processes . to explain the scaling and the non monotonic behavior of the scaling function we present a scenario that attributes the observed behavior to two contributions : ( a ) side jumps mechanism and ( b ) k - l ( berry phase ) mechanism including the effect of finite scattering rates . in the limit of low resistivity ,",
    "the two contributions have quadratic dependence on resistivity with coefficients of opposite signs where that of k - l term is larger . as resistivity increases",
    ", the k - l term decays due to the effect of finite scattering rates which yields a sign change of @xmath17 .",
