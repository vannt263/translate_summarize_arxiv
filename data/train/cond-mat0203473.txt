    "conversely , the `` non ",

    "they conjectured that @xmath69 is due to non  perfect solvent quality , and a crossover between good solvent behavior ( @xmath70 , large length scales ) and @xmath8 solvent ( @xmath71 , small length scales ) .",
    "in particular , they pointed out that the averaging over @xmath72 assigns a very large statistical weight to the small distances .",
    "although this latter argument is true , and generally accepted as the basic origin for the slow convergence of @xmath0 , the explanation in terms of solvent quality has turned out to be incorrect . in ref .",
    "it was demonstrated that @xmath0 should _ not _ be much more susceptible to solvent quality effects than @xmath73 or @xmath7  the enhanced sensitivity of @xmath0 to the small distances is balanced by the fact that @xmath73 and @xmath7 are more sensitive to the decreased swelling of the chain near its ends : a saw is _ inhomogeneous _ , i.  e. @xmath74 depends on the position of the @xmath75 bond on the chain , and is systematically larger in the interior , as has been shown both numerically @xcite and analytically @xcite .",
    "furthermore , schfer and baumgrtner @xcite performed a detailed rg calculation and predicted in one  loop order for the universal amplitude ratio @xmath76 here @xmath77 is the exact random walk ( rw ) value .",
    "other rg studies resulted in @xmath78 @xcite ( this value was later revised to 1.51 , see ref . ) and @xmath79 @xcite , while a semi  empirical relation based on fitting the distribution function of internal distances to light scattering data yields @xmath80 @xcite .",

    "furthermore , monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of lattice chains at the @xmath8 point revealed that in this case the ratio @xmath6 apparently does _ not _ converge to its gaussian value @xmath10 , but rather to roughly @xmath90 .",
    "our simulations ( see sec . [",
    "sec : numres ] ) find a similar behavior ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "we believe that this can be explained qualitatively from rg arguments @xcite as follows : the asymptotic behavior is expected to be governed by the gaussian fixed point , and thus @xmath92 , as a universal amplitude ratio , is expected to assume the gaussian value .",
    "however , the numerical extrapolation will only produce this value if all relevant correction terms , i.  e. the analytic @xmath93 term , plus the non  analytic corrections , are consistently taken into account . neither the data analysis by guttman _ et al . _ @xcite , nor ours , fulfill this requirement , as both just fit to eq .",
    "[ eq : analcorrhydrad ] with @xmath62 , and thus are expected to produce substantial systematic errors in @xmath92 .",
    "to do this in a better way is practically impossible , since ( i ) our @xmath8 data have insufficient statistical accuracy to allow for additional fit parameters , ( ii ) the precise form of the correction terms is unknown for @xmath0 ( in contrast to @xmath73 and @xmath7 , for which the leading  order terms have been calculated by tricritical field theory @xcite , with the interesting feature that they are universal ) , and ( iii ) the non  analytic corrections vary extremely slowly ( logarithmically ) with @xmath2 , such that either one would need unrealistically long chains to ensure dominance of the leading orders , or an expansion up to unrealistically high order .",

    "[ sec : stiffness ] , we expect a large local chain stiffness to _ decrease _ the correction until it ultimately even changes its sign . the same conclusion has been found by akcasu and guttman @xcite for stiff chains without excluded volume",

    "it should be noted that the numerical resolution ( for each of our models ) is clearly by far not competitive with the study by li _",
    "_ @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "we did not attempt to determine the exponents from our data , but rather used the values for @xmath87 and @xmath37 from ref . .",
    "we did not include an @xmath54 term in the fit for @xmath0    in the saw case , although such a term is expected to be present .",
    "the reason is that our model a data are too inaccurate to allow for such a three ",
    "parameter fit in a stable way .",
    "similarly , we ignored the non  analytic corrections to scaling in the @xmath8 case , for essentially the same reason , as has been discussed in some more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] .",
    "taking the statistical inaccuracies of the data , and of the resulting fit parameters into account , we obtain for the asymptotic amplitude ratio @xmath274 the values @xmath275 at the @xmath8 point , and @xmath276 in the excluded  volume case . the actual error in @xmath82",
    "is expected to be significantly larger , since neither the uncertainties in the exponents and in the location of the @xmath8 point , nor systematic errors due to higher  order corrections to scaling have been taken into account .",
    "this is particularly apparent in the @xmath8 case , where one expects in the asymptotic long  chain limit rather the gaussian value @xmath10 , but also obvious in the saw case , where the results on the longer chains of model c yield a considerably smaller value for @xmath82 .",
    "the most interesting aspect of model b is that it closely    resembles a real system , and a quantitative comparison with experiments is possible @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rgrh_dirk ] we show simulation results for @xmath7 , @xmath0 , and their ratio .",

    "the scaling @xmath4 , and the extrapolation to @xmath277 is nicely borne out by the simulation data .",
    "the experiments are too inaccurate to demonstrate a clear systematic trend . in spite of this ,",
    "an extrapolation yields @xmath278 , which means that the theoretical calculations are supported by data of a real chemical system .",
    "our model c data ( saw ) comprise the largest range of chain lengths of our three models , combined with precise estimates of statistical errors , which allows a more detailed data analysis . for our @xmath7 data",
    ", we obtained the fit @xmath279 with @xmath280 , @xmath281 , where we again use the exponents from ref . .",
    "the deviation @xmath282 ( sum of the residuals squares , normalized by the variances ) has the value @xmath283 ( 10 data points ) . the corresponding quality of fit @xmath284 , which is the probability to observe the measured @xmath282 value , or a larger one , is @xmath285 . our data , in a representation which emphasizes the corrections to scaling ,",

    "[ fig : bdrg2corscal ] .",
    "it is seen that these are indeed weak , highlighting the difficulties in determining an accurate value for the correction  to  scaling exponent .    turning to our @xmath0 data from model c",
    ", we first did a nonlinear two  parameter fit @xmath286 , resulting in @xmath287 .",
    "however , this fit is very poor , with a least ",
    "square sum @xmath288 .",
    "conversely , a linear two  parameter fit @xmath289 yields a rather good value @xmath290 ( @xmath291 ) , with @xmath292 , @xmath293 , demonstrating also numerically that @xmath0 data should be interpreted in terms of corrections to scaling , instead of an effective exponent .",
    "actually , one should expect the presence of an additional correction of order @xmath54 , @xmath294 .",
    "since this correction tends to decrease @xmath7 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : bdrg2corscal ] ) , it should also decrease @xmath0 , i.  e. increase @xmath295 , or weaken the analytic @xmath4    term .",
    "thus , in a regression @xmath296 , where we keep @xmath143 fixed , one should obtain the best fit for a value of @xmath143 slightly smaller than unity .",
    "this is indeed what we observe , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : bdqvalues ] , where we plot the quality @xmath284 of such a fit as a function of @xmath143 .",
    "this figure also clearly rules out a single correction to scaling with an exponent of @xmath96 or even larger .",
    "we thus attempted a three ",
    "parameter fit @xmath297 to also take the @xmath54 term into account .",
    "the result of this fit , which seems to be reasonably stable , is @xmath298 , @xmath299 , @xmath300 , with @xmath301 , and a very good quality @xmath302 .",
    "we thus use this fit to demonstrate the corrections to scaling of @xmath155 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdrhcorscal ] , where the presence of the @xmath54 term shows up in a slight curvature . finally , we also used this fit , combined with the corresponding one for @xmath7 ( see fig .",

    "[ fig : bdratio ] , where the asymptotic value is @xmath303 .",
    "again we feel that the real uncertainty is larger , due to lack of control of the systematic errors .",
