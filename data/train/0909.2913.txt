    "interaction and collisional properties between matter and antimatter is of fundamental importance in physics @xcite .",
    "the anti - hydrogen atom @xmath9 , which is a bound state of an anti - proton @xmath10 and a positron @xmath11 , is the simplest representative of an antimatter atom .",
    "this is a two - particle system , which , however , may possess very different interactional and dynamical properties compared to its matter counterpart the h atom @xcite .    by now much effort has been exerted in various experiments to build and store @xmath9 at cold and ultra - cold temperatures @xcite .",
    "new experiments are planned or in progress to test the fundamental laws and theories of physics involving antiparticles and antimatter in general @xcite .",
    "for example , it follows from the cpt symmetry of quantum electrodynamics that a charged particle and its anti - particle counterpart should have equal and opposite charges and equal masses , lifetimes and gyromagnetic ratios .",
    "the cpt symmetry predicts that hydrogen and anti - hydrogen atoms should have identical spectra . in this way",
    "experimentalists plan to test whether in fact h and @xmath9 have such properties .",
    "specifically , a starting point would be to compare the frequency of the 1s-2s two - photon transition in h and @xmath9 .",
    "also , one of the important practical applications of antihydrogen has been mentioned in @xcite , where the authors considered controlled @xmath9 propulsion for nasa s future plans in very deep space .",
    "researchers at cern @xcite and from other groups @xcite are interested to trap and study @xmath9 at low temperatures , e.g. , @xmath12 k , when the @xmath9 atom will be almost in its rest frame .",
    "the study of lamb shift and response of antihydrogen to gravity at ultra - low energies should allow them to test more precisely the predictions of two fundamental theories of modern physics : quantum field theory and einstein s general theory of relativity @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that the main cause of loss of @xmath9 atoms confined in a magnetic gradient trap is due to @xmath13h@xmath0 and @xmath13he collisions .",
    "therefore , the @xmath13h@xmath0 scattering cross - sections and corresponding rotational - vibrational thermal rate coefficients , in the case of h@xmath0 , would be very helpful to gain a practical understanding of the slowing down and trapping of @xmath9 .",
    "hence the investigation of the possibility of cooling of @xmath9 atoms by colliding them with colder h@xmath0 is of significant practical interest @xcite .",
    "( similar collision between trapped fermionic atoms with cold bosonic atoms has been fundamental in cooling the fermionic atoms and thus leading them to quantum degeneracy @xcite . )",
    "such investigation of @xmath9 interaction with h and h@xmath0 can reveal the survival conditions of @xmath14 in collisions with h and , even more importantly , with h@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "further , cooling occurs by energy transfer in elastic collisions of @xmath9 with h@xmath0 .",
    "however , during the collision the rearrangement process may lead to the formation of protonium ( @xmath15 ) and positronium ( @xmath16 ) exotic atoms and the destruction of @xmath14 atoms .",
    "they are formed as matter - antimatter bound states , which then annihilate .",
    "( there have also been many studies of scattering of positronium atoms @xcite , the lightest matter - anti - matter atom ) .",
    "thus one can conclude , that the effectiveness of cooling @xmath9 is determined from a comparison of the cross sections for direct scattering and rearrangement .    by now a series of theoretical works have been published , in which the properties of interaction between @xmath9 and h , he , h@xmath0 have been investigated @xcite .",
    "some theoretical studies have been carried out for the @xmath14+h system at thermal energies using quantum - mechanical methods @xcite .",
    "also , discussions on the importance and applications for this system , especially , in connection with bose - einstein condensation @xcite , ultra - cold collisions @xcite , and its static and dynamic properties @xcite , can be found in the literature .    in this work we present results for the collision of an ultra - cold @xmath9 atom with h@xmath0 , where h@xmath0 is treated as a rigid rotor with a fixed distance between hydrogen atoms .",
    "the elastic , rotational state - resolved scattering cross sections for the @xmath9-h@xmath0 scattering and their corresponding thermal rate coefficients are calculated using a non - reactive quantum - mechanical close - coupling approach .",
    "the potential interaction between @xmath9 and the hydrogen atoms is taken from ref .",

    "the results and discussion are presented in sec .",

    "additionally , we tested other propagator schemes included in molscat .",
    "our calculations reveal that other propagators can also produce quite stable results .",
    "the log - derivative matrix is propagated to large intermolecular distances @xmath61 , since all experimentally observable quantum information about the collision is contained in the asymptotic behavior of functions @xmath62 .",
    "the numerical results are matched to the known asymptotic behavior of @xmath59 relating to the the physical scattering @xmath63-matrix @xcite    @xmath64    where @xmath65^{1/2}$ ] is the channel wave - number of channel @xmath66 , @xmath67 is rotational channel energy and @xmath46 is the total energy in the @xmath45 system .",

    ", we will present our results for rotational quantum transitions in collision between h@xmath0 and an anti - hydrogen atom @xmath22 , that is @xmath84 here h@xmath0 is treated as a vibrationally averaged rigid monomer rotor .",

    "the rotation constant of the h@xmath0 molecule has been taken as @xmath85@xmath86 .",
    "the h@xmath0 rigid rotor model has been already applied in different publications @xcite . for the considered range of kinetic energies",
    "the model can be quite justified in this special case when only pure rotational quantum transitions at low collisional energies are of interest as in h@xmath0(@xmath5)+@xmath22 , and when the energy gap between rotational and vibrational energies is much larger than kinetic energy of collision .",
    "in such a model the quantum mechanical approach is rather simplified .",
    "next we consider an important physical parameter in atomic and molecular collisions , e. g. , the pes between the atoms .",
    "there is no global potential energy surface available for the three - atom @xmath22-h@xmath0 system .",
    "however in ref .",
    "@xcite , the author calculated the values of interaction energy between h and @xmath22 , i. e. , the h-@xmath22 energy curve using the rayleigh - ritz variational method .",
    "further , the microhartree accuracy of born - oppenheimer energies of the system has been achieved in that work .    to construct the h@xmath0-@xmath22 interaction potential",
    "we take the h-@xmath22 energy data from ref .",
    "@xcite and make a cubic spline interpolation through all 46 points taken from table 1 of that paper .",
    "these data have been tabulated from @xmath87 a.u .",
    "to @xmath88 a.u",
    ". inter - atomic distances .",
    "because in the current work we use the rigid rotor model for h@xmath0 , we do not need the interaction energy between hydrogen atoms in h@xmath0 .",
    "the interaction potential between a hydrogen molecule and @xmath22 is taken by sandwiching the two @xmath22-h potential energy curves : @xmath89 where distances between atoms are written as follow ( cf .",
    "1 ) : @xmath90    the functions @xmath91 with @xmath92 are represented as cubic spline interpolation functions for any value of @xmath93 or @xmath94 as follows : @xmath95 where @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 perform the spline interpolation and where @xmath99 , in each sub - interval @xmath100 $ ] , @xmath101 . the coordinates @xmath102 and corresponding values of the h-@xmath103 potential energy data have been taken from table 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the calculated pes is shown in fig .",
    "it is clear that the potential has a singular value when the distance between @xmath22 and h@xmath0 is equal to zero .",
    "additionally , the @xmath104-h@xmath0 pes which we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pesmodel ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "specifically , this potential was used in our calculations of @xmath22 + h@xmath0 collisions . again , as seen in fig .",
    "2 the potential energy curve between @xmath22-h has a coulomb type singularity at small distances . in our calculations we needed to make additional test runs to achieve convergence in our results . in the next section",
    "we will briefly demonstrate the numerical convergence of the results when calculating total elastic scattering cross sections .",
    "these results depend on various numerical and quantum - mechanical scattering parameters .",
    "numerous test calculations have been undertaken to insure the convergence of the results with respect to all parameters that enter in the propagation of the schrdinger equation .",
    "these include the atomic - molecular distance @xmath61 , the total angular momentum @xmath105 , the number of total rotational levels to be included in the close - coupling expansion and others , see fig .  1 .",
    "particular attention has been given to the total number of numerical steps in the propagation over the distance @xmath61 of the schrdinger equation ( [ eq : cpld ] ) . specifically , the parameter r ranges from 0.75 a.u . to 20.0 a.u .",
    "we used up to 50000 propagation points .",
    "we also applied and tested different mathematical propagation schemes included in molscat .",
    "the rotational energy levels of @xmath106-h@xmath21 and the corresponding angular momenta @xmath5 are shown in table i. the goal of this work is to get new results for @xmath9 + @xmath106-h@xmath0 thermal rate coefficients @xmath75 at ultra - low temperatures : specifically @xmath107 k@xmath108 k. the corresponding cross sections have been calculated for collision energies varying from @xmath109 @xmath86 to @xmath110 @xmath86 .",
    "these energy values are very small . however , despite this fact , to reach convergence of the results we needed to include in expansion ( [ eq : expan ] ) a significant number of rotational levels of the h@xmath0 molecule , specifically up to @xmath111 . below in table",
    "ii we present these results .    also , we found that , at lower energies , for the numerical solution of eq .",
    "( 4 ) a much larger number of propagation ( integration ) points are needed than at higher energies .",
    "specifically , at higher energies we need 500 propagation points , but for lower energies 50,000 points are needed to achieve comparable precision .",
    "convergence has been achieved for elastic scattering cross sections for various scattering parameters .",
    "below in table iii we present these results .",
    "then we used this data in our calculation for rotational energy transfer , elastic scattering cross section and thermal rate coefficient .    now in table ii we present results for the total elastic cross sections for two collisional energies : 0.1 @xmath86 and 0.01 @xmath86 the cross sections are shown for a number of different maximum values of the rotational angular momentum @xmath112 in the h@xmath0 molecule included in expansion ( [ eq : expan ] ) .",
    "this is also the jmax parameter in molscat @xcite .",
    "other scattering parameters have also been treated correctly in the calculation .",
    "one can see that jmax should be at least 56 .",
    "the other scattering parameter in table ii is mxsym @xcite .",
    "it reflects the number of terms in the potential expansion over angular functions @xcite .",
    "it is therefore evident that in this calculation we need to keep at least 24 terms in the expansion . in table iii",
    "we also present results for total elastic scattering cross sections for few more selected energies .",
    "however in this table the convergence has been reached by increasing the total angular momentum @xmath105 and by increasing the total number of the propagation steps in the propagation over the coordinate @xmath61 of the schdinger equation ( [ eq : cpld ] ) .",
    "as expected , for lower energy collision we needed smaller values for the maximum @xmath105 .",
    "for example , for collision energy @xmath113 a.u .",
    "it is enough to have @xmath114 , however @xmath115 should be taken for @xmath116 a.u . in regard to the total number of the propagation steps in the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cpld ] ) one can see , that we need to include many more propagation points for low energy calculations .",
    "all test calculations in table iii have been done with jmax = 56 and mxsym = 24 .",
    "the obtained results concerning the numerical and scattering parameters have been used in our calculation for total elastic @xmath117 and rotational quantum state transfer @xmath118 cross sections and corresponding thermal rate coefficients @xmath75 .",
    "now we present computational results for process ( [ eq : proc1 ] ) , namely , for elastic scattering ( @xmath119 ) and for low quantum number rotational transition between levels with @xmath120 and 4 : @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 . from the results of table iii we see that to reach numerical convergence , for example , for the elastic scattering cross section , we need to include a large number of h@xmath0 rotational levels , specifically up to 60 .",
    "the results for the elastic scattering cross sections @xmath2 for @xmath9 + h@xmath0 @xmath125 h@xmath0 + @xmath9 are shown in fig .  4 together with the corresponding results of variational calculations of gregory and armour @xcite .",
    "it can be seen , that basically the two sets of cross sections are close to each other , although in our calculation we use larger number of collision energy points , specifically up to 200 . in our calculation",
    "a shape resonance is found at energy @xmath126 hartree . as in ref .",
    "@xcite our @xmath2 tends to reach a constant value at lower energies with @xmath127 .",
    "this result allows us to calculate the @xmath22+h@xmath0 scattering length , which is @xmath128 the gregory - armour scattering length @xcite obtained with a variational method is @xmath129 .",
    "the two results are in reasonable agreement with each other .    in fig .  5 ( a ) and ( b ) we show the total state - resolved cross sections @xmath130(v ) vs. velocity v and the corresponding thermal rate coefficients @xmath131(t ) vs. temperature t for the hydrogen molecule rotational relaxation process",
    "it is seen , that when the collision energy increases the de - excitation cross section decreases .",
    "it can be explained in the following way : at low relative velocities ( kinetic energies ) between h@xmath132 and @xmath22 , the rotationally excited h@xmath0 molecule has more time for interaction and consequently , it has higher quantum - mechanical probability to release its internal rotational energy to @xmath22 .",
    "the resulting corresponding rate coefficients have been calculated for a temperature range from @xmath133 and are also presented in fig .  5 below the cross section results .",
    "next , in fig .  6 ( a ) and ( b ) we present results for the total state - resolved cross sections @xmath134(v ) vs. velocity v and the corresponding thermal rate coefficients @xmath135(t ) vs. temperature t for the hydrogen molecule rotational excitation process .",
    "it is quite understandable , as we find from fig .",
    "6 ( a ) , that when the collision energy ( relative velocity v ) is increases the quantum - mechanical probability and corresponding cross section of the rotational excitation of h@xmath21 are also increases . figure 6 ( b ) depicts the corresponding results for the thermal rate coefficient .    in figs . 7 ( a ) and ( b ) we present results for cross sections and rates for rotational relaxation process , as in figs . 5 ( a ) and ( b ) , but now connecting the states @xmath136 and @xmath137 . finally , in figs . 8 ( a ) and",
    "( b ) we present results for cross sections and rates for rotational relaxation process but now connecting the states @xmath136 and @xmath138 .",
    "an unexpected result has been found in fig . 7 ( a ) in the rotational transition cross section @xmath139 ,",
    "i.e. , when the h@xmath0 quantum angular momentum has been changed from @xmath136 to @xmath137 .",
    "one can see , that the values of these cross sections at very low collision energies are almost from 5 to 10 times larger then other cross sections considered in this work , compare with the results from figs . 5 , 6 and 8 .",
    "a quantum - mechanical study of the state - resolved rotational relaxation and excitation cross sections and thermal rate coefficients in ultra - cold collisions between hydrogen molecules h@xmath0 and anti - hydrogen atoms @xmath22 has been the subject of this work .",
    "a model pes for h@xmath0-@xmath22 has been constructed by sandwiching two h-@xmath22 interaction potentials for two different hydrogen atoms taken from ref .",
    "this h-@xmath22 interaction potential is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the h@xmath0-@xmath22 pes is presented in fig .",
    "calculation for total elastic scattering cross section and for low quantum rotational transition states have been performed .",
    "we considered only the following quantum transitions : 2@xmath1250 , 0@xmath1252 , 4@xmath1252 , and 4@xmath1250 .",
    "a test of the numerical convergence was undertaken .",
    "these results are presented in tables ii and iii .",
    "our results reveal that it is necessary to set the rotational angular momentum @xmath140 in the h@xmath0 molecule to a relatively large number , i.e. in the expansion ( [ eq : expan ] ) we needed to include up to 60 terms .",
    "the calculation was performed using the molscat program @xcite .",
    "different propagation schemes included in the molscat program have been used and tested .",
    "additionally , the mxsym potential parameter in that program also needed to have a relatively large value to obtain good convergence as can be seen from table ii .",
    "the numerical convergence has also been tested over the total number of the propagation steps over coordinate @xmath61 in the solution of the schrdinger equation ( [ eq : cpld ] ) .",
    "we have found , that at low energies we need a much larger number of integration points than at higher energies , cf .",
    "table iii .",
    "our results for the h@xmath21+@xmath22 total elastic scattering cross section are in reasonable agreement with the corresponding results from gregory and armour @xcite .",
    "the authors of this paper used a different pes , which is still unpublished , and applied a quantum - mechanical variational approach .",
    "unfortunately , the rotational transitions in the h@xmath21+@xmath22 collisions have not been calculated in that work @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting results of the present work is that the cross section of the rotational transitions from h@xmath141 at ultra - low energies are approximately 5 - 10 times larger than other transition state cross sections .    to the best of our knowledge we do not know of any other calculation of the rotational transitions in the h@xmath21+@xmath22 collision .",
    "these results can help to model energy transfer processes in the hydrogen - anti - hydrogen plasma , and perhaps to design new experiments in the field of the anti - hydrogen physics .",
    "finally , we believe , that in the future work it should be useful to include vibrational degrees of freedom of the h@xmath0 molecules , i.e. to carry out quantum - mechanical calculations for different rotational - vibrational relaxation processes : @xmath142 where @xmath143 and @xmath144 are the vibrational quantum numbers of h@xmath0 before and after the collision , respectively .                                    p. k. biswas and s. k. adhikari , chem .",
