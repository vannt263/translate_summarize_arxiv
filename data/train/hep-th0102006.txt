    "supersymmetric nonrenormalization ( nr ) theorems aid in the identification of exactly marginal operators , and ensure exact flat directions giving rise to moduli spaces of vacua . the structure of superconformal algebras aids in the determination of exact anomalous scaling dimensions . and",
    "the structure of supersymmetry algebras with central charges can determine the exact mass spectrum of states invariant under a fraction of the supersymmetry generators ( the bps states ) .",
    "we will discuss each of these topics in turn .",
    "knowledge of exactly marginal operators ( and their associated dimensionless couplings ) is crucial to probing the strong coupling physics of field theories since one way of approaching strong coupling is by appropriately tuning a marginal coupling to a large value .",
    "the nr theorems of supersymmetric field theories give information to all orders in perturbation theory ( see the talks by iliopoulos and west ) and nonperturbatively ( following the work of seiberg @xcite ) about certain classes of couplings .    to take the most famous example , in four - dimensional ( @xmath0 ) @xmath1 supersymmetric gauge theories , the superpotential and gauge kinetic terms , @xmath2 are protected by such an nr theorem .",
    "more precisely , the theorem says that the anomalous dimensions @xmath3 of the chiral superfields @xmath4 ( coming from their kinetic terms ) can only enter into the renormalization group ( rg ) running of the couplings @xmath5 and @xmath6 in a prescribed manner .",
    "suppose , for instance , that @xmath7 then the nr theorems imply the exact rg @xmath8 function relations @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the gauge group representation of @xmath4 , @xmath11 is its index , and @xmath12 is the canonical scaling dimension of @xmath13 .",
    "this nr theorem helps in finding exactly marginal operators in those cases where the choice of representations @xmath10 and operators @xmath13 are such that @xmath14 . in this case",
    "one can deduce the existence of linear combinations of couplings with exactly vanishing @xmath8 functions ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a simple example @xcite illustrating this is the @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath15 theory with three adjoint chiral multiplets @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , with superpotential @xmath19 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the symmetry under cyclic permutations of the @xmath4 we see that the @xmath3 are all equal , to @xmath20 , say",
    ". then ( [ betafncs ] ) implies @xmath21 .",
    "thus , in this four complex dimensional space of couplings @xmath22 we would generically expect to find a three dimensional submanifold of exactly marginal couplings ; furthermore , since this submanifold goes through the origin ( _ i.e. _  weak coupling ) we are assured that it indeed exists . the precise equation for the manifold of marginal couplings @xmath23 is in general not known exactly away from the origin .",
    "( in this particular example , though , a one dimensional subspace is , namely @xmath24 where there is an enhanced @xmath25 supersymmetry . )",
    "another way of probing the strong coupling behavior of field theories is by tuning the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of scalars to approach a strongly coupled vacuum .",
    "this can only be done if the scalars are _ moduli _ of the theory_i.e . _  have exactly flat potentials .",
    "the nonperturbative control over potential terms implied by the nr theorem discussed above allows us in the case of 4 conserved supercharges ( _ e.g. _  @xmath0 @xmath1 supersymmetry ) to tune the couplings to ensure the existence of flat directions . in the case of 8 or more supercharges (",
    "_ e.g. _  @xmath0 @xmath26 or @xmath27 @xmath28 ) the flat directions are generic  no tuning is necessary .",
    "a well known example is the @xmath0 @xmath29 @xmath15 superqcd theory . here",
    "the complex scalar @xmath30 in the vector multiplet has an @xmath31 complex dimensional moduli space , the coulomb branch , where @xmath32 generically breaks @xmath33 . in the cases where the superqcd theory is asymptotically free ( af ) with strong coupling scale @xmath34 , the coulomb branch breaking for @xmath35 is just a weakly coupled higgs mechanism . on the other hand , sending @xmath36 probes strongly coupled @xmath15 physics . as pioneered in @xcite , using analytic continuation in @xmath30 together with some qualitative physical assumptions allows an exact determination of the nonperturbative low energy effective action on the coulomb branch for all values of @xmath30 .    more generally , this program of analytic continuation on a moduli space of vacua is greatly aided by the fact that the geometry of the moduli space is constrained by supersymmetric selection rules . for example , as discussed in the talks of de wit and ferrara , @xmath0 @xmath1 supersymmetry implies that the moduli space is a kahler manifold ;",
    "@xmath29 implies a kind of product of rigid special kahler and hyperkahler manifolds ; while @xmath0 @xmath25 theories have locally flat moduli spaces with orbifold singularities .",
    "finally , it is sometimes useful to note that the existence of exactly marginal couplings and exactly flat directions are not unrelated . by embedding a given theory , @xmath37 , in a larger af theory , @xmath38 , marginal couplings in @xmath37",
    "can often be realized as vevs along a submanifold of the moduli space of @xmath38 .",
    "indeed , in gravitational ( string or m ) theories there are no couplings : all field theory marginal couplings are lifted to flat directions for some scalars .",
    "the structure of superconformal algebras ( discussed in the talks by ferrara and west ) allows the determination of the exact anomalous scaling dimensions of certain operators , which often provide useful `` diagnostics '' for strongly coupled vacua .    if a scale invariant supersymmetric vacuum is also conformally invariant , then the theory is invariant under the superconformal extension of the supersymmetry algebra .",
    "thus , heuristically , if the supersymmetry algebra is @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 run over the different supersymmetry generators in extended supersymmetry , then the superconformal algebra has double the number of fermionic generators , with a superconformal generator @xmath42 for each @xmath43 , satisfying @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the generator of special conformal transformations .",
    "associativity of the algebra then implies @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the generator of dilatations and @xmath48 are the r - symmetry generators .",
    "these algebras are tightly constrained by associativity ; for example , for @xmath49 they only exist for @xmath1 in @xmath50 and @xmath51 or @xmath52 in @xmath27 , and not at all if @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the classification of unitary ( or `` positive energy '' ) representations of the superconformal algebras @xcite imply inequalities on the eigenvalues of @xmath47 and @xmath48 following essentially from the positivity of operators like @xmath54 ^ 2 $ ] and the algebra ( [ qq][qs ] ) .",
    "these inequalities are saturated for certain chiral fields ( annihilated by some of the @xmath43 and @xmath42 generators ) .",
    "knowledge of the r - symmetry charges of these operators then allows one to deduce their @xmath47 charges , _",
    "i.e. _  their exact scaling dimensions @xcite .",
    "bps states are supersymmetric particle states whose mass can be determined exactly from the structure of the supersymmetry algebra .",
    "they can thus provide another `` diagnostic '' of ( non - scale - invariant ) strongly coupled vacua .",
    "the argument is analogous to that determining scaling dimensions from the superconformal algebra . in the non - conformal case the r",
    "- charges do not enter the algebra , but a set of @xmath55 charges  the central charges @xmath56commuting with all other generators can enter : @xmath57 positivity of operators like @xmath58 then give inequalities between the eigenvalues of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , _ i.e. _  between particle masses and their @xmath55 charges . for certain states  the bps states  which are annihilated by some fraction of the @xmath43 , these inequalities are saturated and the mass is determined by the central charge @xcite . in certain cases",
    "the supersymmetric selection rules and analytic continuation techniques mentioned in section 1.2 above can be used to determine the central charges and thus the bps spectrum as functions of the couplings and vevs at strong coupling ; _ e.g. _  @xcite .",
    "instead of attempting a survey of the kinds of strongly coupled phenomena that have been found using the tools outlined in the last section , i will focus on three open questions concerning strongly coupled phenomena which i think are both important and on which progress can be made .",
    "different values of the exactly marginal complex gauge coupling @xmath61 where @xmath6 is the gauge coupling and @xmath62 the theta angle in a scale invariant @xmath0 gauge theory , are typically identified under s - duality ( also known as montonen - olive duality or strong - weak coupling duality ) transformations .",
    "the prototypical example of this @xcite is the @xmath63 group of s - duality identifications in @xmath0 @xmath25 superyang - mills .",
    "this group is generated by the theta angle @xmath64 rotation @xmath65 and by inversion of the gauge coupling @xmath66 .",
    "this s - duality group relates weak ( @xmath67 ) to ultra - strong ( @xmath68 ) couplings , but does not `` solve '' the strong coupling behavior of @xmath25 superyang - mills .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  1 which shows a fundamental domain in the complex @xmath69 upper half plane under these identifications .",
    "this domain includes a weak coupling limit ( @xmath67 ) at @xmath70 as well as some special strong coupling vacua at @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( where @xmath73 ) .",
    "these special strong coupling points have enhanced @xmath74 and @xmath75 discrete global symmetries , respectively , but apparently no other more striking behavior .",
    "a similar story holds for scale invariant @xmath0 @xmath29 @xmath76 superqcd with four fundamental hypermultiplets @xcite .",
    "however , the story changes qualitatively for @xmath0 @xmath29 superqcd with gauge groups with rank @xmath77 . for the generic such theory",
    ", the s - duality relations no longer identify all ultra - strong coupling points with weak coupling points .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  2 which shows a fundamental domain for the s - duality group of @xmath15 @xmath78 @xmath0 @xmath29 superqcd @xcite which is an index three subgroup of @xmath63 .",
    "note that a point ( @xmath79 ) with @xmath80 is included in the domain .",
    "the question thus arises as to what is the nature of the physics at these ultra - strongly coupled theories with @xmath79 . that there is some qualitatively new physics ( as compared to the merely strongly coupled theories )",
    "can be deduced from the behavior of the low energy @xmath81 effective action on the coulomb branch of these theories , where we observe that as @xmath82 the effective action becomes singular , indicating the appearance of new light degrees of freedom . moreover ,",
    "these new singularities appear everywhere on the coulomb branch and not just on a submanifold of it .",
    "there are a number of possibilities for the answer to this question",
    ". perhaps these ultra - strong coupling points are in fact the weak coupling limits of some other theory .",
    "if so this would raise the possibility of a `` web of dualities '' connecting different field theories similar to what is seen in calabi - yau compactifications of string theories .",
    "however in the simplest case of @xmath83 @xmath29 superqcd an explicit survey of all known scale - invariant theories with rank 2 gauge groups finds no weak coupling candidate which matches onto the @xmath83 theory .",
    "for example , a promising candidate ( from hints from a iia string construction of the @xmath83 theory ) is the scale invariant @xmath84 theory with 2 fundamental hypermultiplets in each factor and one bifundamental hypermultiplet ; an analysis @xcite of the coupling space of this theory shows no ultra - strong coupling points .",
    "a second possibility is that due to an ambiguity in the overall scaling of operators as one approaches the ultra - strong point , the singularity in the effective action is really just a kind of coordinate singularity_i.e . _  a place where no new light states occur , but where the coupling space joins smoothly to that of another theory .    a final , and most likely , possibility is that the ultra - strong coupling points signal a genuinely new strongly coupled `` phase '' of gauge theories .",
    "perhaps a hint of this comes from the iia brane construction @xcite for the @xmath29 theories , where the ultra - strong points correspond to brane configurations with coincident ns5 branes .",
    "we will discuss the @xmath27 physics of stacks of ns5 branes in section  2.3 below .",
    "another interesting class of strongly coupled theories occur as superconformal vacua at special points on a moduli space of vacua .",
    "for example ,",
    "all the @xmath0 @xmath29 superconformal field theories with a one complex dimensional coulomb branch ( which we will parameterize as the complex @xmath85 plane ) can be described by the singular degenerations of seiberg - witten tori as shown in table  1 .",
    ".the physical inequivalent degenerations of seiberg - witten tori ( as @xmath86 ) describing @xmath0 @xmath29 conformal field theories with a single modulus @xmath85 together with their associated global symmetry groups @xmath87 and the scaling dimensions @xmath88 of the modulus superfield . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     here @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the auxiliary complex variables describing the seiberg - witten riemann surface .",
    "the mass scaling dimensions @xmath88 of the @xmath29 chiral superfield @xmath91 whose lowest component is the modulus @xmath85 are found using the superconformal algebra as described in section  1.3 above .",
    "the dimensions of the associated coupling @xmath5 is @xmath92 as follows from the form of the @xmath29 superspace coupling @xmath93 referring to these theories by their global symmetry groups , we see that only the global @xmath94 theory has an exactly marginal coupling .",
    "this coupling is in fact the gauge coupling of the scale invariant @xmath76 theory with four fundamental hypermultiplets described in @xcite .",
    "the three global @xmath95 theories were found in @xcite by tuning masses and vevs in the global @xmath94 theory .",
    "what interests us here are the three @xmath96 theories found in @xcite which have no known embedding in @xmath0 gauge theories . in other words they have not been shown to appear as limits of other af or scale invariant gauge theories in four dimensions .",
    "there is in fact a large class of such `` exceptional '' or `` isolated '' @xmath0 conformal field theories : many can easily be found with 2 complex dimensional coulomb branches ( though no complete classification is known in this case ) , and evidence from the ads / cft correspondence @xcite shows that the global @xmath96 theories have relatively benign large @xmath97 limits ( where @xmath97 refers to the `` rank '' of the theory , in this case given by the dimension of its coulomb branch ) .    given that these theories have no known embedding in a @xmath0 theory with a weakly coupled limit , how do we know they actually exist at all as consistent field theories ?",
    "the evidence for their existence comes from string constructions : they can be realized as compactifications of similar isolated @xmath50 @xcite or @xmath27 conformal theories @xcite which in turn have known string constructions . for instance , the @xmath50 theories can be constructed @xcite as the field theory on coincident d4 brane probes of a iia string background with d8 branes and o8 orientifold planes .",
    "the question naturally arises as to what is an intrinsically four dimensional _ definition _ of these theories .",
    "possible ways of answering this question would be to either embed these theories in some higher rank af theories ( possibly with less supersymmetry ) ; or to find something analogous to the lattice definition of af gauge theories , _",
    "i.e. _  a direct nonperturbative definition",
    ".    this question is equivalent to asking for a @xmath0 characterization of the universality classes of these theories .",
    "note that these isolated @xmath0 conformal field theories should be contrasted to other @xmath0 theories which are thought to have only higher - dimensional definitions , such as the `` scale invariant '' @xmath0 @xmath29 theories with compact coulomb branch @xcite , or the infrared ( ir ) free @xmath50 @xmath29 superyang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "unlike the @xmath0 conformal field theories we have been discussing , there is no reason to think that these latter theories _ have _ to have a @xmath0 ( or @xmath50 ) definition , since they include irrelevant operators which may indeed be inherited from a higher dimensional theory .",
    "perhaps the strangest and most interesting strong coupling behavior yet encountered in supersymmetric field theories are the `` little string '' theories which can be thought of either as @xmath27 non - gravitational string theories at a fixed ( strong ) coupling , or as quasi - local field theories which lack operators more localized than a certain length scale .",
    "these theories are known through their string constructions .",
    "below i will simply list some of the properties of these theories in the simplest case of @xmath27 with 16 supercharges .",
    "their string construction is as the theory living on a stack of @xmath98 ns5 branes in either iia or iib string theory with fixed string tension @xmath99 and in the limit as the string coupling vanishes @xmath100 .",
    "this limit implies that bulk ( @xmath101 ) string modes including gravity decouple , and leaves a non - trivial @xmath27 theory with a scale @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "the ir properties of these theories , _",
    "i.e. _  at scales below @xmath102 , are as follows ( short reviews are @xcite ) . at the origin of their moduli spaces",
    "one finds either an @xmath103 supersymmetric ir free yang - mills theory with a general rank @xmath98 gauge group @xmath104 @xcite ( from the iib string construction ) ; or an @xmath105 conformal field theory with a @xmath106-@xmath107-@xmath96 classification ( from the iia string construction ) . at a generic point on moduli space",
    "the @xmath103 theory is broken down to @xmath98 massless @xmath55 vector multiplets , while the @xmath105 theory is broken down to @xmath98 self - dual antisymmetric tensor multiplets .",
    "these theories both have bps string states with tensions which approach @xmath108 at the origin in the @xmath103 theory and zero in the @xmath52 theory .",
    "the density of states at the origin depends on the rank as @xmath109 in the @xmath110 theory and @xmath111 in the @xmath52 theory .",
    "the long wavelength limit of compactifications of both these theories on a circle gives a @xmath50 @xmath29 superyang - mills theory with gauge group @xmath104 .",
    "the @xmath52 low energy properties strongly hint at some kind of `` nonabelian self - dual 2 form gauge theory '' .",
    "however no such local classical field theory has been constructed , despite interesting guesses at the algebraic structure which might play a role analogous to the lie algebra structure of yang - mills theory ( for example , @xcite ) , and systematic computations of the self - interactions of 2 form gauge fields from the effective action of 5 branes ( for example , @xcite ) . in any case , the ir properties of the little string theories by themselves are consistent with them being some relevant deformation of a @xmath27 local superconformal field theory .",
    "the real surprise is that this is _ not _ the case : the theory is in fact nonlocal above the scale @xmath102 .",
    "the most striking evidence of this is the fact that these theories inherit the t - duality of their iia and iib superstring parents .",
    "thus , the @xmath52 theory compactified on a circle of radius @xmath112 is equivalent to the @xmath110 theory compactified on a circle of radius @xmath113 .",
    "this sort of behavior is characteristic of closed string degrees of freedom with tension @xmath108 .",
    "furthermore , these theories have a hagedorn density of states @xmath114 with @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "these high energy properties suggest that there may be a weakly coupled ( and non - gravitational ) description of these theories as strings , though perhaps only at high enough energy densities .",
    "the question here , as in section  2.2 , is what is an intrinsic or minimal definition of little string theory .",
    "actually , there is already an answer : the discrete light cone quantization of little strings in ( uncompactified ) @xmath27 is equivalent to the @xmath116 limit of a certain @xmath117 supersymmetric quantum mechanics or a @xmath118 dimensional sigma model @xcite .",
    "although in principle this gives a nonperturbative definition of the theory , it is very hard to compute with it .",
    "moreover , basic properties of the theory , such as lorentz invariance and its bps spectrum are not manifest and are only expected to be recovered in the @xmath116 limit . on the other hand , it has been argued that these theories obey the axioms of `` quasi - local '' field theory in which correlators exist in momentum space but not in position space on length scales less than @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "perhaps this indicates that there is a more direct definition of little string theories .",

    "<S> in the first part of this talk i will briefly outline those features special to supersymmetric theories which together provide a powerful handle on the nonperturbative vacuum structure of these theories . </S>",
    "<S> the second part will then describe some of the more unusual or unexpected things we have learned about strongly coupled gauge theories . </S>",
    "<S> this discussion will be formulated in the guise of three open questions . here </S>",
    "<S> i restrict myself to lorentz invariant gauge field theories without gravity in 4 , 5 , and 6 dimensions with 8 or 16 hermitian conserved supercharges . </S>",
    "<S> these restrictions are just to keep this talk short : field theories in lower dimensions and with fewer supersymmetries have an even greater variety of strong coupling behaviors , and likewise for gravitational ( _ i.e. _  string ) theories . </S>"
