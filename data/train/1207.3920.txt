    "<S> the derivation is based on a sequence of transformations for lattice sums of coulomb two - particle potentials plus the neutralizing background , having their origin in the general theory of jacobi theta functions . </S>",
    "<S> the new series provide convenient starting points for both analytical and numerical progress . </S>",
    "<S> its convergence properties are indeed excellent : truncation at the fourth term determines in general the energy correctly up to 17 decimal digits . </S>",
    "<S> the accurate series representations are used to improve the specification of transition points between the phases and to solve a controversy in previous studies . in particular , it is shown both analytically and numerically that the hexagonal phase i is stable only at @xmath3 , and not in a finite interval of small distances between the plates as was anticipated before . </S>",
    "<S> the expansions of the structure energies around second - order transition points can be done analytically , which enables us to show that the critical behavior is of the ginzburg - landau type , with a mean - field critical index @xmath5 for the growth of the order parameters . </S>"
