    "it is well known that disorder in the parameters of physical models can induce scattering and localization , and the most outstanding example is the electronic anderson model .",
    "this model has been the focus of a large set of theoretical , numerical and experimental studies over the last three decades , and there is an enormous literature on various aspects of this problem . at the same time , the related problem of vibrations in disordered materials received almost no attention , although structural disorder is very common in glasses and other disordered materials .",
    "it is well known that in low temperatures there are several features common to most glasses .",
    "an outstanding phenomenon is the existence of an anomalous heat conductivity at low temperature , a plateau in the heat conductivity in a higher temperature range , and no decrease in it at higher temperatures  @xcite .",
    "it is not clear if those effects are the results of nonlinear phenomena @xcite or of harmonic vibrations @xcite .",
    "a calculation of transport in a vibration model is a good way of testing whether the main mechanism of heat conductance in glasses is obtained from the linear harmonic vibration modes , or if nonlinear scattering processes have to be invoked .    since vibration hamiltonians are elastically stable there are special constraints on the dynamics .",
    "therefore , though the dynamical equations are similar to the anderson problem of a quantum particle in a random potential there are some major diffrences due to these constraints .",
    "this model is a random laplacian model , with positive off diagonal coefficients .",
    "it leads to the existence of a global translation mode at zero frequency .",
    "this features has a decisive influence on the entire spectrum of vibrations at low frequencies .",
    "other distinguishing features are the vector character of the vibrations , and in the case of a two ( or more ) component systems , random masses .",
    "we will comment in more detail on these differences in section 2 .",
    "the focus of this study is a scalar lattice vibration model with random elastic coefficients , and equal masses .",
    "this model disregards some of the important features of glass vibrations .",
    "nevertheless , in a previous work which focused on the eigenstates @xcite , it was shown that this model contains many of the interesting features of glass vibrations , and is qualitatively different from the usual electronic models .",
    "the present work reveals the phase diagram and the conductance properties of the disordered lattice model .",
    "we note that the model under discussion also describes a free quantum particle with disorder in its transport behavior .    in our study",
    "we find several new qualitative features that are absent in the classical anderson problem .",
    "some theoretical studies were vibration problems with disorder , such as @xcite , have concluded that they belong to the same universality class as the anderson model .",
    "this is not the case for in the model studied here and in @xcite .",
    "we outline the main differences : in the three dimensional electronic anderson model there are two phases : diffusive with extended states and localized . in the vibrational case",
    "there are four phases .",
    "in addition to the two phases familiar from the anderson problem there is an insulating sub - exponentially localized phase with multifractal normal modes , and a strongly conducting phase , with states characterized by weak scattering , and a well defined wavelength . the phase diagram is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] , and described in detail in section  [ sec:3d ] .    in two dimensions",
    "the anderson model is insulating with exponential localization and all the states are multifractal , while in the vibrational case exponential localization is also observed , but a transition occurs between multifractal and extended modes , accompanied by a singularity in the localization length .",
    "this is discussed in detail in our paper on the two dimensional case @xcite .",
    "the former study @xcite concentrated on a numerical study of the properties of the normal modes . in the present paper",
    "we apply the transfer matrix method  @xcite to the vibration model .",
    "this method has the advantage of pointing out precisely the transition between conducting and insulating behavior through localization .",
    "the finite size scaling analysis which has been used earlier to calculate the physical quantities now reveals the presence of additional length scales .",
    "the method also provides a direct tool for calculating the conductance of finite systems .",
    "the various numerical methods which are used to analyze the anderson model , and the results obtained have been recently reviewed by @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] we define the model , the numerical method , and explain how the numerical data are used to study the system .",
    "section  [ sec:3d ] describes in detail the results in the three dimensional case , emphasizing the different qualitative behaviors . in section  [ sec : kappa ] we apply the results of section  [ sec:3d ] to calculate the thermal conductivity as a function of temperature .",
    "the paper is concluded with a discussion of the relevance of our results to glasses .",
    "the vibration problem in glasses is a vector problem which is defined for a disordered lattice where both structural and elastic disorder play a major part . in this paper",
    "we treat a simpler variant of this problem : the scalar vibration model .",
    "the model under consideration is defined on a @xmath0-dimensional simple cubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "it consists of a scalar field which is subject to elastic equations of motion . for a normal mode of frequency",
    "the field equations read @xmath2\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote lattice sites .",
    "the @xmath5 s are symmetric ( @xmath6 ) , positive , independent and identically distributed random numbers .",
    "a similar model was introduced recently by @xcite to describe boson peaks in glasses .",
    "this model is in fact a realization of the anderson tight binding model with special constraints .",
    "the diagonal terms are the sum of the off diagonal terms in the same row , and the off diagonal terms are real and positive number .",
    "the same model describes free particle .",
    "the focus of the present study is the transport properties of this model . for this purpose",
    "it is convenient to single out a preferred direction , and label the coordinate in this direction by @xmath7 .",
    "we define a column vector @xmath8 whose components are the values of @xmath9 at the sites on the hyperplane labeled by @xmath7 .",
    "it is then possible to use eq .",
    "( [ de ] ) to express @xmath10 in terms of @xmath8 and @xmath11 .",
    "this linear relation defines a random transfer matrix @xmath12 by @xmath13 the transfer matrices @xmath12 have the same non - zero elements as those of the anderson tight - binding model .    following the standard methods developed in the context of disordered electronic systems , we study the conductance properties using the lyapunov spectrum of the product @xmath14 due to the left - right symmetry of the problem , the lyapunov exponents come in pairs of opposite signs . for any positive value of @xmath15 , and for non - vanishing disorder",
    "all the exponents are non - zero , signaling that in a quasi-1d geometry the system is always insulating .",
    "the smallest of the non - zero exponents may be identified with the best conducting channel , so that it gives the inverse of the finite size localization length @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the transverse size of the system .",
    "we study @xmath16 as a function of @xmath17 , with the aim of finding the asymptotic behavior for large @xmath17 .",
    "the following types of asymptotics are known to occur in models of electronic localization    1 .",
    "the localization length saturates to a finite value @xmath18 this is the localized phase which is expected to characterize systems with strong disorder , and low dimensionality .",
    "2 .   the critical state , @xmath19 .",
    "this behavior is commonly associated with the delocalization transition , using the scaling hypothesis .",
    "3 .   the diffusive phase , @xmath20 .",
    "this phase is expected to have ohmic behavior , @xmath21 and the conductivity @xmath22 is proportional to @xmath23 ,    since the transverse size of the system which can be studied numerically is limited , the extrapolation to infinite size can be improved significantly using finite - size scaling ( fss ) @xcite , which assumes a scaling form @xmath24 with different scaling functions above and below the transition .",
    "the localization length @xmath25 is found numerically to diverge as @xmath26 in three dimensions and as @xmath27 in two dimensions where @xmath28 measures the disorder strength , and @xmath29 is the critical value of disorder in three dimensions .",
    "the average conductance @xmath30 is given , using the the entire set of lyapunov exponents @xmath31 , by @xmath32 for a hypercubic sample @xcite",
    ". we will show below that in the diffusive state , since the spacing between the lyapunov exponents is slowly varying , the conductivity @xmath22 is indeed proportional to @xmath23 . however , this is not always valid , and we show below that the relation between @xmath22 and @xmath23 breaks down when scattering is too weak .    here , we study the transport properties for different values of @xmath1 , rather than disorder . as expected , we find that small @xmath1 corresponds in many ways to weak disorder ; the basic reason for this is that the uncorrelated disorder is averaged out in its effect on large wavelength modes , which correspond to small @xmath1 . however , the mapping between small @xmath1 , and weak noise is exact only in one dimension  @xcite .",
    "we find that the behavior as a function of @xmath1 is considerably more involved than that which is known for electronic models , and which has been reviewed above .",
    "we find several new phases , and conclude that in three dimensions the simple scaling picture of the localization transition does hold for our model . as a result , fss does not hold in the simple form  ( [ fss ] ) , and has to be modified .",
    "the present study confirms and adds further information to the new features which were discovered in the geometry of the eigenmodes of the same model @xcite .",
    "as described is section  [ sec : model ] , the various phases of the system can be characterized by the asymptotic behavior for large transverse width @xmath17 of the the finite size localization length @xmath16 which is the inverse of the smallest non - negative lyapunov exponent and of the conductance @xmath30 which is defined in terms of the lyapunov exponents in  ( [ gl ] ) .",
    "the results of this section were obtained for the model  ( [ de ] ) in a bar shaped geometry , with a square cross section of width @xmath17 , and a fixed distribution of the values of the elastic constants @xmath33 : a binary distribution with @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we computed the lyapunov exponents of the product  ( [ product ] ) for different values of @xmath17 , @xmath36 .",
    "the number of realizations which were multiplied was between @xmath37 for the smallest widths , and @xmath38 for the largest .",
    "we studied the transport properties for varying @xmath1 .",
    "these results are summarized in the phase diagram displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] .",
    "we sketch the major features of the phase diagram . for frequencies which are higher then @xmath39 we observe a normal localized phase with exponential localization .",
    "however in the transition range near @xmath39 , the usual finite size scaling ansatz fails , and a modified finite size scaling with two parameters is needed to rescale the data . for smaller frequencies in the range",
    "@xmath40 we observe a divergence of the finite localization length as a non - trivial power of the system size in the entire range available to us .",
    "this phase is interpreted as being sub - exponentially localized . in the range @xmath41 we observe the normal diffusive behavior familiar from electronic models , but finite size scaling has again to be modified near the transition .",
    "these effects are related to a continuous change in the multifractal exponents of the _ normal modes _ in this range , instead of a sharp transition . at frequencies which are lower than @xmath42 ,",
    "the normal diffusive behavior is replaced by an irregular dependence of the transport properties on the system parameters .",
    "the diffusion coefficient becomes hard to define numerically , and a variety of types of size dependence of the conductance is observed .",
    "since @xmath43 is the range corresponding to weak scattering as found in  @xcite , these effects can be interpreted as residuals of the ballistic propagation between scattering events .",
    "we expect a long crossover region before an ultimately diffusive behavior can be observed .",
    "the rest of this section is devoted to a detailed description of the phases in the order they appear with decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "the system is localized for values of @xmath44 .",
    "this phase is characterized by the existence of a finite limiting localization length @xmath45 which we conventionally identify with the range of the green s function of eq .",
    "( [ de ] ) @xmath46    we found that in the localized phase the dependence of @xmath47 on @xmath48 is well approximated as linear .",
    "this function can then be linearly extrapolated to @xmath49 , giving an estimate for @xmath50 .",
    "the values of @xmath25 thus obtained are listed in table  [ tab:3dloc ] for various values of @xmath15 .",
    ".[tab:3dloc ] the values of the localization length @xmath25 as determined by extrapolation to @xmath51 , and the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 of the modified fss  ( [ fss ] ) , as a function of @xmath15 in the localized phase in three dimensions .",
    "the values missing from the table could not be determined significantly numerically , except when a value is given for @xmath52 and not for @xmath53 , where @xmath53 was fit to 1 .",
    "the different symbols were obtained for different values of @xmath1 , all of which are given in table  [ tab:3dloc ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 obtained from the modified fss  ( [ modfss ] ) are also reported in table  [ tab:3ddiff ] , and the data collapse obtained after scaling the raw data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3ddiff ] .",
    "for values of @xmath1 where @xmath56 , the parameter @xmath52 may be identified with @xmath57 , with good agreement with the values of @xmath23 measured by direct extrapolation .",
    "as can be seen from table  [ tab:3ddiff ] , the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 increase in absolute value as @xmath1 is increased toward @xmath58 , and diverge slowly .",
    "this implies an interesting behavior of the localization properties near @xmath58 : suppose that the asymptotic behavior of the scaling function @xmath59 in  ( [ modfss ] ) for small argument is power like , @xmath60 taking a value of @xmath1 close to @xmath58 , so that @xmath52 is very large , one finds from eqs .",
    "( [ modfss ] ) and  ( [ scfnas ] ) that @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "this behavior has to match the one observed at the lower edge of the anomalous localized phase , which implies the identity @xmath63 the dependence on @xmath17 shown in  ( [ ntas ] ) means that very close to the transition the system looks localized for small @xmath17 because @xmath64 is decreasing , before the crossover to the asymptotic linear growth of @xmath64 .",
    "this scenario is corroborated by the minimum in the curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3ddiff ] .",
    "since this is a conducting phase , it is instructive to compare the parameter @xmath23 with the conductivity @xmath22 .",
    "the calculation of the latter from the lyapunov spectrum may be achieved using eqs .",
    "( [ gl ] ) and  ( [ gdiff ] ) .",
    "we remark that the dimensionless conductance @xmath30 calculated from  ( [ gl ] ) is sometimes called the transmission coefficient , since it is obtained by regarding the system as placed between ideal leads and providing @xmath65 channels which conduct energy between the leads",
    ". the precise dependence of @xmath30 on the channel transmissions is model dependent , and  ( [ gl ] ) reflects one possible choice  @xcite .",
    "the reason that @xmath23 gives a good estimate for @xmath22 in the diffusive phase is that the lyapunov spectrum in this phase vanishes linearly at zero @xcite , and the spacing between the lyapunov exponents changes slowly , as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig : lyapdiff ] .",
    "this is in contrast with the lyapunov spectrum in the low frequency range discussed below .",
    "to see how @xmath22 and @xmath23 are related let us assume that the @xmath66 lyapunov exponents are evenly spaced , with spacing @xmath47 .",
    "the formula for the conductivity  ( [ gl ] ) involves a sharp cutoff at @xmath67 , so it basically counts the number of exponents smaller than @xmath48 .",
    "therefore we get @xmath68 . since @xmath69 and @xmath70 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are proportional . in table",
    "[ tab:3ddiff ] we give the measured values of @xmath22 .",
    "the agreement between @xmath23 and @xmath22 remains good throughout the diffusive phase .      in this subsection",
    "we describe the properties of the system for @xmath71 .",
    "we find that for very small @xmath1 short range disorder becomes irrelevant , and the vibration modes behave very similarly to modes of a pure system with a well - defined wave vector @xmath5 and an acoustic dispersion relation @xmath72 .",
    "such modes exist even in one - dimensional systems , but are restricted to a band of width @xmath73 around @xmath74 . similarly in three dimensions , although for any positive @xmath1 the transport is ultimately diffusive , there is a band of ballistic modes with a well defined wave vector near @xmath74 , which disappears in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the existence of this band may be simply understood as a consequence of the divergence of the mean free path @xmath75 as @xmath76 .",
    "for any finite system there is a positive frequency @xmath77 where @xmath75 becomes larger than the system size , and for smaller frequency a wave propagates through the system with essentially no scattering .    outside the ballistic band , and for @xmath78 , the normal mode analysis of  @xcite shows that the modes experiences scattering which destroys the unique wave vector dependence .",
    "however , the absolute scale of the wave vector , the _ wavelength _ , is still well defined , and it is significantly larger than the lattice spacing .",
    "the wavelength is defined up to some width , which is commonly associated with the inverse of the mean free path .",
    "the transport analysis of the present study reveals that a qualitative change in the structure of the lyapunov spectrum occurs at @xmath42 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lyapbal ] a typical lyapunov spectrum of the low frequency phase is displayed , to be compared with fig .",
    "[ fig : lyapdiff ] .",
    "the lyapunov spectrum at small @xmath1 is characterized by the presence of large gaps ; these obviously rule out the possibility of a description of the conductivity using a single parameter .",
    "the conductivity of the system depends sensitively on the system size , as well as the other parameters of the problem .",
    "the origin of the gaps in the lyapunov spectrum can be traced to the behavior of a pure system which is extended infinitely in the longitudinal direction .",
    "in such a system , for every longitudinal wave number @xmath79 , there are @xmath66 modes with @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 are the possible values of the transverse wave vector .",
    "these represent @xmath66 channels , which are perfectly conducting in the pure system . however , for a given @xmath1 one will have less then @xmath66 solutions since some of channels may be blocked , when the transverse vector is too large ( transverse confinement ) .",
    "therefore the conductivity of the pure system depends discontinuously on @xmath1 : when @xmath1 is increased beyond the threshold values the conductivity jumps by an integer amount .",
    "this picture describes quite accurately the conductance @xmath30 for small frequencies @xmath83 . as @xmath1",
    "is increased the lyapunov spectrum is less well described by the one of an effective pure system , but gaps and irregularities in the spectrum persist up to @xmath42 , reflecting a non - vanishing transverse confinement .",
    "consider the conductance @xmath30 as a function of @xmath1 for a fixed system size @xmath17 . as just explained , for small @xmath1 system size the conductance is ballistic , and the value is proportional to the number of open channels , which is proportional to @xmath84 .",
    "this behavior persists as long as @xmath17 is smaller than the mean free path @xmath75 . since the mean free path diverges as @xmath85 in three dimensions @xcite",
    ", the crossover occurs at @xmath86 , therefore @xmath87 .",
    "since the system is expected to be diffusive for any positive @xmath1 , the dependence of @xmath30 on @xmath17 should change from the quadratic dependence of the ballistic range to an ultimately linear one , @xmath88 . if we assume a simple crossover from ballistic to diffusive behavior of @xmath30 when @xmath89 , continuity of @xmath30 in @xmath17 implies that @xmath90 , and the conductivity would diverge as @xmath91 .",
    "however , the conductivity should diverge at the same rate as the mean free path , _",
    "i.e. _ , as @xmath92 .",
    "it follows then that there is a range in @xmath17 where @xmath30 grows stronger than linearly but weaker than quadratically , before the final diffusive behavior sets in .",
    "these different behaviors and crossovers are represented in the conductance as measured numerically , and presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : condcan ] .",
    "the conductance at small @xmath1 is very well described by that of an effective pure system with sound speed @xmath93 , which is between the two possible values for the elastic constant , @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( recall that the masses were set to 1 ) .",
    "the agreement is quantitative as is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : condcollapse ] , where the measured conductivity is shown against @xmath96 , and compared with that of the effective pure system . at the frequency range @xmath97 the functional form of @xmath30 is harder to describe .",
    "@xmath98 indeed grows faster than linearly and slower than quadratically , but as a result of the transverse effects discussed above , the growth rate is not monotonic and subject to sharp changes .",
    "thus , we were unable to measure precisely the growth rate of @xmath30 as a function of @xmath17 for a fixed @xmath1 . on the other hand it has been possible to measure the growth rate of the maximal value of @xmath30 for a fixed @xmath17 @xmath99 which is the smallest possible growth rate , since @xmath100 .",
    "the ultimately linear growth of @xmath30 as a function of @xmath17 could not be observed in our numerics in this range for our system sizes .",
    "the results of the previous section can be used to calculate the overall heat conductivity of a three - dimensional disordered harmonic lattice , in the presence of a temperature gradient . the heat flow through a sample connected to two infinite ideal leads at different temperatures",
    "has been recently derived  @xcite . from this , the thermal conductivity @xmath101 may be calculated , taking the temperature difference to be small , giving @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the frequency dependent transmission rate , discussed in the previous section , and @xmath104 .",
    "below we use units such that planck s constant and boltzmann s constant are both equal to one .",
    "the distribution function @xmath105 which appears in  ( [ kappa ] ) diverges like @xmath106 for small @xmath1 , and has an exponential cutoff at @xmath107 .",
    "hence for the purpose of a qualitative estimate we can replace @xmath105 by @xmath106 , cutting off the frequency integration at @xmath108 , with @xmath109 an order 1 constant .",
    "this approximation gives @xmath110 thus , as the temperature increases , modes with higher @xmath1 contribute to @xmath101 ; if @xmath111 is in the frequency range of one of the phases , then some of the modes of this phase contribute to @xmath101 , the phases of lower @xmath1 contribute fully , and those of higher @xmath1 do not contribute at all .",
    "it follows that when @xmath112 only the strongly conducting phase should be taken into account . if the system is small enough so that @xmath113 , the conductance is carried by ballistic modes , and eq .  ( [ kps ] ) gives @xmath114 as in a perfect lattice . when @xmath115 this form is no longer valid , and scattering should be taken into account .",
    "unfortunately , the numerical results provide limited information about the asymptotic behavior of @xmath30 in this range , and we are forced to make an ansatz about the form of @xmath30 which takes into account the numerical results and theoretical predictions , such as @xmath116 this ansatz gives a linear dependence of @xmath101 on @xmath12 in the intermediate frequency range , with a coefficient proportional to @xmath117 and a fast saturation at higher temperatures .    at temperatures greater or of the order of @xmath42 the contribution to @xmath101 of the strongly conducting phase is therefore _ anomalous _ growing with the system size as @xmath117 .",
    "the exponent of the anomaly should be considered as only indicative , but the contribution of the ballistic band itself already gives a @xmath118 anomaly .",
    "the divergence of the heat conductivity of the harmonic modes at low frequency is quite robust , and has been observed also in molecular simulations of glasses @xcite .",
    "nonlinear interaction are invoked to obtain heat conductivity which remains finite in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this can be done phenomenologically by replacing the system size dependence of @xmath101 by the inelastic mean free path .",
    "in contrast , the contribution of the diffusive phase is quite simple : @xmath119 which gives ohmic , system size independent , conductivity , increasing linearly at first , and saturating as @xmath120 .",
    "this contribution , however , becomes negligible when the system size is taken to infinity . finally the contribution of the localized phases to @xmath101 decays exponentially in the system size , and these phases are insulating .",
    "we also used eq .",
    "( [ kappa ] ) to calculate @xmath121 directly from the numerical values of @xmath103 ; the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa ] , scaled with @xmath122 .",
    "the integration over @xmath1 suppresses the finite size effects , and it can be seen that the @xmath122 scaling slightly overestimates the measured anomaly .",
    "as expected , one observes in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa ] a @xmath123 increase for small @xmath12 , followed by a linear increase for intermediate @xmath12 and a saturation .",
    "a power law fit for the saturation yields an @xmath124 anomaly , but we regard this value as indicative only .",
    "we wish to comment on two central issues related to our model .",
    "first , in the scalar vibration model the delocalization transition is smoothed in the sense that there are two critical points , and there is a continuous change of the multifractal exponents near the transition . moreover , far from the transitions one can observe the classical finite size scaling behavior similar to the anderson scaling .",
    "our second principal conclusion is that the heat transport of modes of low frequency has some peculiarities probably related to the existence of a well defined wavelength .",
    "the low - temperature conductivity due to this band reproduces some of the experimental phenomena in glasses , such as a linear dependence on the temperature , and an eventual saturation ( plateau ) . in recent papers @xcite ,",
    "it has been argued that the heat transport in silicon glass is governed by harmonic modes ; our model reproduces quite convincingly several of their results .",
    "in particular , there is no need to invoke non - linear processes such as two level systems to explain the temperature dependence of the heat conductivity . in all cases , however ,",
    "the harmonic approximation yields a conductivity which diverges as some small power of the system size , and this feature must be corrected by the nonlinearity of the interaction .",
    "the disordered lattice model is thus found to be a useful tool to study heat transport of glasses , and it will be very interesting to find out what will happen with a vector vibration field and with random masses .    *",
