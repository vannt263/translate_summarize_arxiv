    "for a bounded quantum system in the semiclassical limit , statistical properties of energy levels at a given energy have been intensively studied .",
    "universal behaviors are found in statistics of _ unfolded _",
    "energy levels@xcite , which are sequence of numbers uniquely determined by the energy levels using the mean level density obtained from the thomas - fermi rule(see appendix a ) . for quantum systems",
    "whose classical counterparts are strongly chaotic , the unfolded level statistics are well characterized by the random matrix theory which gives level spacing distribution obeying the wigner distribution@xcite .    for quantum systems",
    "whose classical counterparts are integrable(such systems will be referred to as classically integrable systems ) , level statistics were theoretically studied by berry - tabor@xcite , sinai@xcite , molchanov@xcite , bleher@xcite , connors and keating@xcite , and have been the subject of many numerical investigations .",
    "still its mechanism is not well understood , the level spacing distributions are believed to be the poisson ( exponential ) distribution for generic classically integrable systems .    as suggested e.g. , by hannay ( see the discussion of @xcite ) , one possible explanation would be as follows : for an integrable system of @xmath5 degrees - of - freedom , almost every orbit is generically confined in each inherent torus , and whole region in the phase space is densely covered by invariant tori as suggested by the liouville - arnold theorem@xcite . in other words , the phase space of the integrable system consists of infinitely many tori which have ] infinitesimal volumes in liouville measure .",
    "then , the energy level sequence of the whole system is a superposition of sub - sequences which are contributed from those regions .",
    "therefore , if the mean level spacing of each independent subset is large , one would expect the poisson distribution as a result of the law of small numbers@xcite .    as shown by the pioneering work of berry and robnik@xcite , this would be the case for the nearly integrable systems consisting of large number of independent components .",
    "quantum energy eigenstates are considered to be a superposition of various classical trajectories , which are connected by the tunneling effect . in the semiclassical limit , because of the suppression of the tunneling , energy eigenstates are expected to be localized on individual region in phase space explored by a typical trajectory of classical system@xcite , such as tori and chaotic regions , and to form independent components .",
    "the level spacing distribution is , then , regarded as a product of superposition of energy levels contributed respectively from those independent components .",
    "based on this view , berry and robnik observed that the level spacing distribution of the system consisting of a single regular component , described by a poisson distribution , and @xmath6 chaotic components , described by the wigner distributions of equal strength , approaches the poisson distribution when @xmath7 .",
    "the localization of energy eigenfunctions onto individual phase space structures was studied by berry as a semiclassical behavior of the wigner function@xcite . for the classically integrable system",
    ", it is shown that the wigner function tends to delta function on tori in the semi - classical limit@xcite .",
    "such localization phenomenon of eigenfunctions has been observed numerically for several systems@xcite .",
    "for example in ref.@xcite , it was shown that the husimi distribution function of each energy eigenstate is well localized either on the classical chaotic regions or on the regular regions filled with classical tori and that the energy eigenvalues corresponding to eigenfunctions supported by distinct phase - space regions obey distinct statistics .",
    "those works seem to imply that the existence of infinitely many independent components is an essential ingredient of the appearance of poissonian level spacing distribution and that the semiclassical limit is one of the mechanisms providing infinitely many components .",
    "however , in some classically integrable / nearly - integrable systems@xcite , where one might expect infinitely many components , deviations from the poissonian distribution have been observed .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to explore the consequences only of the existence of infinitely many independent components .    in this paper , along the line of thoughts of berry and robnik@xcite , we investigate the distribution of unfolded energy levels when energy levels consist of infinitely many independent components , and show the possibility of deviation from the poisson distribution .",
    "hereafter , for the sake of simplicity , unfolded energy levels will be referred to as energy levels or levels .",
    "we briefly review the berry - robnik theory@xcite .",
    "it relates the statistics of the energy level distribution to the phase - space geometry by assuming that the sequence of the energy spectrum is given by the superposition of statistically independent subspectra , which are contributed respectively from eigenfunctions localized onto the invariant regions in phase space .",
    "formation of such independent subspectra is a consequence of the condensation of energy eigenfunctions on disjoint regions in the classical phase space and of the lack of mutual overlap between their eigenfunctions , and , thus , can only be expected in the semi - classical limit where the planck constant tends to zero , @xmath8 .",
    "this mechanism is sometimes referred to as _ the principle of uniform semi - classical condensation of eigenstates_@xcite , which is based on an implicit state by berry@xcite .",
    "the validity of this assumption is checked numerically in the semi - classical(high energy ) region where the planck volume is much smaller than the phase volume of each invariant region@xcite .    in the berry - robnik approach@xcite",
    ", the overall level spacing distribution is derived along a line of mathematical framework by mehta@xcite , as follows : consider a system whose classical phase space is decomposed into @xmath6 disjoint regions .",
    "the liouville measures of these regions are denoted by @xmath9 which satisfy @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath11 be the gap distribution function which stands for the probability that an interval @xmath12 contains no level .",
    "@xmath11 is expressed by the level spacing distribution @xmath13 as follows ; @xmath14 when the entire sequence of energy levels is a product of statistically independent superposition of @xmath6 sub - sequences , @xmath15 is decomposed into those of sub - sequences , @xmath16 , @xmath17 in terms of the normalized level spacing distribution @xmath18 of sub - sequence , @xmath16 is given by @xmath19 and @xmath18 is assumed to satisfy@xcite @xmath20 note that the spectral components are not always unfolded automatically in general even when the total spectrum is unfolded .",
    "however , in the sufficient small interval @xmath21 $ ] , each spectral component obeys a same scaling law ( see appendix [ appendix_a ] ) and thus is unfolded automatically by an overall unfolding procedure . equations ( [ eq:1 - 2 ] ) and ( [ eq:1 - 4 ] ) relate the level statistics in the semiclassical limit with the phase - space geometry .    in most general cases ,",
    "the level spacing distribution might be singular .",
    "in such a case , it is convenient to use its cumulative distribution function @xmath22 ; @xmath23 the corresponding quantity of the overall level spacing distribution is @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the level spacing distribution function corresponding to @xmath15 .",
    "in addition to equations ( [ eq:1 - 2 ] ) and ( [ eq:1 - 4 ] ) , we assume two conditions for the statistical weights :    * assumption ( i ) : the statistical weights of independent regions uniformly vanishes in the limit of infinitely many regions ; @xmath26 * assumption ( ii ) : the weighted mean of the cumulative distribution of energy spacing , @xmath27 converges in @xmath7 to @xmath28 @xmath29 the limit is uniform on each closed interval :  @xmath30 .    in the berry - robnik theory ,",
    "the statistical weights of individual components are related to the phase volumes of the corresponding invariant regions .",
    "this relation is satisfactory if the thomas - fermi rule for the phase space fractions still holds in general .",
    "here we do not specify their physical meaning and deal with them as parameters .    under the assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) , eqs.([eq:1 - 2 ] ) and ( [ eq:1 - 4 ] ) lead to the overall level spacing distribution",
    "whose cumulative distribution function is given by the following formula in the limit of @xmath7 , @xmath31 } \\label{eq:1 - 10},\\ ] ] where the convergence is in the sense of the weak limit .",
    "when the level spacing distributions of individual components are sparse enough , one may expect @xmath32 and the level spacing distribution of the whole energy sequence reduces to the poisson distribution ,    @xmath33    in general , one may expect @xmath34 which corresponds to a certain accumulation of the levels of individual components .    in the following sections , the above statement is proved and the limiting level spacing distributions are classified into three classes .",
    "one of them is the poisson distribution as discussed in the original work by berry and robnik@xcite .",
    "the others are not poissonian .",
    "we give examples of non - poissonian limiting level spacing distributions in section iii . in the concluding section",
    ", we discuss some relations between our results and other related works .",
    "in this section , starting from eqs.([eq:1 - 2 ] ) and ( [ eq:1 - 4 ] ) , and the assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) introduced in the previous section , we show that , in the limit of infinitely many components @xmath7 , the level spacing distribution converges weakly to the distribution with the cumulative distribution function : @xmath35 } \\label{eq:2 - 1}.\\ ] ] according to helly s theorem@xcite , this is equivalent to show that the cumulative distribution function @xmath36 converges to @xmath37 .",
    "the convergence is shown as follows .    following the procedure by mehta(see appendix a.2 of ref.@xcite ) , we rewrite the gap distribution function @xmath15 in terms of the cumulative level spacing distribution functions @xmath38 of independent components : @xmath39 = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\left[1-\\rho_i \\int_0^{s }   d\\sigma \\left(1-\\mu_i(\\sigma)\\right)\\right ] \\label{eq:2 - 2}.\\ ] ] the second equality follows from eq.([eq:1 - 4 ] ) , integration by parts and @xmath40 , which results from the existence of the average . then , the overall cumulative level spacing distribution function @xmath36 is given by @xmath41 first we consider the behavior of @xmath15 .",
    "since the convergence of @xmath42 for @xmath7 is uniform on each interval @xmath43 $ ] by assumption ( ii ) , @xmath44}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & -\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left[\\rho_i\\int_0^{s}d\\sigma ( 1-\\mu_i(\\sigma))+o(\\rho_i^2)\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & = & -\\int_0^s d\\sigma \\left[1-\\mu(\\sigma;n)\\right ] + \\sum_i^n o(\\rho_i^2)\\label{eq : sum}\\\\ & & \\longrightarrow - \\int_0^s d\\sigma   \\left[1-\\bar{\\mu}(\\sigma)\\right]\\quad\\mbox{as}\\quad n\\to + \\infty \\label{lim:01},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used @xmath45 , @xmath46 in @xmath47 , and the following property obtained from assumption ( i ) @xmath48 with @xmath49 a positive constant .",
    "the @xmath7 limit of the sum in the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq:2 - 3 ] ) can be calculated in a similar way .",
    "indeed , as @xmath50 in @xmath47 , one has @xmath51 therefore , we have the desired result : @xmath52 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      since @xmath38 is monotonically increasing and @xmath53 , @xmath0 has the same properties .",
    "then , @xmath54 for any @xmath55 and one has @xmath56 the limit classifies the following three cases :    * case 1 ,  @xmath2 : the limiting level spacing distribution is the poisson distribution .",
    "note that this condition is equivalent to @xmath57 for @xmath58 because @xmath0 is monotonically increasing .",
    "* case 2 ,  @xmath59 : for large value of @xmath1 , the limiting level spacing distribution is well approximated by the poisson distribution , while , for small value of @xmath1 , it may deviates from the poisson distribution .",
    "* case 3 ,  @xmath4 : the limiting level spacing distribution deviates from the poisson distribution for @xmath60 , in such a way that the cumulative distribution function approaches 1 as @xmath61 more slowly than does the poisson distribution .",
    "this case will be referred to as a sub - poisson distribution .",
    "one has case 1 if the individual level spacing distributions are derived from scaled distribution functions @xmath62 as @xmath63 where @xmath62 satisfy @xmath64 and are uniformly bounded by a positive constant @xmath65 : @xmath66 ( @xmath67 and @xmath55 ) .",
    "indeed , one then has @xmath68 this includes the case studied by berry and robnik@xcite , where the level spacing distribution is a superposition of a single regular component and @xmath6 equivalent chaotic components , and the latter is expressed by the product of the scaled distributions as in eq.([eq:1 - 2 ] ) .",
    "indeed , one has @xmath69 where the statistical weights are @xmath70 and the individual level spacing distributions @xmath62 corresponding to the gap distributions @xmath71 are given by @xmath72}.\\ ] ] in addition , this would be the case when the system consists of identical @xmath6 components where the level spacing distribution is described by a scaled form as eq.([eq:4 - 8 ] ) .",
    "such a case is expected when there is a symmetry such as the regular polygonal billiards .",
    "we remark that , when the limiting function @xmath73 is differentiable , the asymptotic level spacing distribution admits the following density : @xmath74 \\exp{\\left[-\\int_0^s \\left(1-\\bar{\\mu}(\\sigma)\\right)d\\sigma \\right ] } \\label{density}.\\ ] ]",
    "as an example of the deviation from the poisson distribution , we study the quantum systems whose energy levels are described by using positive integer numbers , @xmath75 and @xmath76 as follows , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the system parameter .",
    "such energy levels are given , for instance , by the rectangular billiard system whose aspect ratio of two sides is characterized by @xmath78@xcite . in this paper , the unfolding transformation of the energy levels @xmath79 ( see appendix [ appendix_a ] )",
    "is done by using the leading weyl term of the cumulative mean number of energy levels , @xmath80 for a given energy interval @xmath81 $ ] , @xmath76 or @xmath75 can be regarded as an index which classifies energy levels into spectral components . in this paper , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , \\label{eq : cx}\\ ] ] is adopted for classification where @xmath84 , and @xmath85 $ ] stands for the maximum integer which does not exceed @xmath86 .",
    "the relative weight of each component , @xmath9 , is given by @xmath87 as easily seen , @xmath88 satisfies the assumption ( i ) ; @xmath89 note that the limit of infinitely many components , @xmath90 , corresponds to the high energy limit , @xmath91 ( see eq.([eq : cx ] ) ) , which is equivalent to the semiclassical limit . in this limit ,",
    "the statistical weight of each sub - spectrum becomes sparse , since each element of @xmath92 , @xmath93 , tends to zero : @xmath94 .    in the billiard system",
    ", each spectral component obeys a same scaling law ( see appendix [ appendix_a ] ) , and thus is unfolded automatically by an overall unfolding procedure .    figures 1(a)1(c ) show numerical results of the level spacing distribution @xmath13 for three values of @xmath78 . in case",
    "that @xmath78 is far from rational , @xmath13 is well approximated by the poisson distribution ( fig.1(a ) ) .",
    "while in case that @xmath78 is close to a rational , @xmath13 shows large deviation from the poisson distribution ( figs.1(b ) and 1(c ) ) .",
    "when @xmath78 is a rational expressed as @xmath95 , where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are coprime positive integers , @xmath13 is not smooth and becomes a sum of delta functions in the limit of @xmath98@xcite , which are separated by a same step @xmath99 , @xmath100    figures 2(a)2(c ) show the function @xmath101 for three values of @xmath78 corresponding to figures 1(a)1(c ) , respectively .",
    "the dotted line in each figure corresponds to the poisson distribution , @xmath102 . as shown in figures 2(b ) and 2(c ) , the distribution function for small value of @xmath1 clearly deviates from the poisson distribution .",
    "however , for large value of @xmath1 , it approaches a line whose slope is @xmath103(see the dashed line ) , and thus , the level spacings for large value of @xmath1 obey the poisson distribution .    in order to compare the non - poissonian distributions and the classification given in the previous section , we consider , @xmath104}.\\ ] ] when @xmath90 , @xmath105 approaches @xmath106 and this function distinguishes the three cases as follows : in case 1 i.e. , where the level spacing obeys the poisson distribution , @xmath107 . in case2 , @xmath108 as @xmath61 @xmath109 , and in case 3 , where the sub - poisson distribution is expected , @xmath110 as @xmath61 .",
    "figure 3 shows @xmath105 for different values of @xmath6 . from this",
    ", one can think that @xmath105 for @xmath111 well approximates @xmath112 .",
    "figure 4 shows @xmath105 for the three values of @xmath78 corresponding to figures 1(a)1(c ) , respectively . in case that @xmath13 is well characterized by the poisson distribution ( figure 1(a ) ) , the corresponding function @xmath105 agrees with @xmath103 . in case",
    "that @xmath13 deviates from the poisson distribution ( figures 1(b ) and 1(c ) ) , @xmath105 approaches a number less than @xmath103 for @xmath61 .",
    "therefore these results correspond to the case 2 . in this model , we have not yet observed the clear evidence of case 3 .",
    "such a case is expected when there is stronger accumulation of the energy levels of individual components .",
    "in this paper , along the line of thoughts of berry and robnik@xcite , we investigated the level spacing distribution of systems with infinitely many independent components and discussed its deviations from the poisson distribution . in the semiclassical limit , reflecting infinitely fine classical phase space structure , individual energy eigenfunctions are expected to be well localized in the phase space and give independent contribution to the level statistics . keeping this expectation in mind",
    ", we considered a situation where the system consists of infinitely many components and each of them gives an infinitesimal contribution . and",
    "by applying the arguments of mehta , and berry and robnik , the limiting level spacing distribution was obtained which is described by a single monotonically increasing function @xmath0 of the level spacing @xmath1 .",
    "the limiting distribution is classified into three cases ; case 1 : poissonian if @xmath2 , case 2 : poissonian for large @xmath1 , but possibly not for small @xmath1 if @xmath3 , and case 3 : sub - poissonian if @xmath4 .",
    "thus , even when energy levels of individual components are statistically independent , non - poisson level spacing distribution is possible .",
    "note that the singular level spacing distribution can be taken into account in terms of non - smooth cumulative distribution @xmath113 .",
    "such a singularity is expected when there is strong accumulation of the energy levels of individual components . for certain class of systems ,",
    "such accumulation is observable .",
    "one example is shown in section iii where the results show clear evidence of case 2 .",
    "another example is studied by shnirelman@xcite , chirikov and shepelyansky@xcite , and frahm and shepelyansky@xcite for a certain type of systems which contain quasi - degeneracy result from inherent symmetry(time reversibility ) .",
    "as is well known , the existence of quasi - degeneracy leads to the sharp shnirelman peak at small level spacings .",
    "one of the interesting features of the level statistics is the level clustering which is described by a nonvanishing value of the level spacing distribution function at @xmath114 .",
    "level clustering is expected for integrable systems or mixed systems , but not for strongly chaotic systems due to the level repulsion . for certain class of systems ,",
    "rigorous results are available ; molchanov@xcite analyzed the energy levels of a one - dimensional schrdinger operator with random potential and showed that the level clustering arose from the localization of the eigenfunction in the semiclassical limit .",
    "minami also analyzed a one - dimensional schrdinger operator with @xmath115-potentials and reported the same result@xcite .",
    "the limiting level spacing distribution obtained in this paper possesses level clustering property . indeed , when @xmath0 is differentiable , the level spacing distribution function ( [ density ] ) has nonvanishing value at @xmath114 : @xmath116 .",
    "it is also interesting to extend the berry - robnik distribution ( [ brfactor ] ) for the level statistics of the nearly integrable system with two degree - of - freedom .",
    "the classical phase space of this system consists of regular and chaotic regions .",
    "since the regular regions corresponding to the system consist of infinitely many independent regions , original proposal for the gap distribution by berry and robnik would be replaced by @xmath117 } \\prod_{i=1}^{n }   e_i^{\\mbox{\\tiny rmt}}(s;\\rho_i ) , \\label{eq:4.6}\\ ] ] where @xmath118 is the gap distribution function of the @xmath76th chaotic component obtained from the random matrix theory .",
    "the above distribution formula is classified into cases ; case 1 , @xmath2 : berry - robnik distribution , case 2 , @xmath3 : berry - robnik distribution for large @xmath1 , but possibly not for small @xmath1 , and case 3 , @xmath4 : a distribution function obtained by the superposition of spectral components obeying the sub - poisson statistics and the random matrix theory . from this classification",
    ", one can see that the new formula ( [ eq:4.6 ] ) admits deviations from the berry - robnik distribution when @xmath119 .    for nearly integrable systems with two degree - of - freedom , prosen and",
    "robnik showed numerically that the berry - robnik formula ( [ brfactor ] ) well approximates the level spacing distributions in the high energy region that is called _ the berry - robnik regime_@xcite , while it deviates in the low energy region and approximates the brody distribution .",
    "they studied this behavior in terms of a fractional power dependence of the spacing distribution near the origin at @xmath114 , which could be attributed to the localization properties of eigenstates on chaotic components@xcite . from the above classification",
    ", one can see that the condition @xmath2 should be satisfied in the berry - robnik regime . while case 2 and case 3 in the above classification might propose another possibilities .",
    "when the spectral components corresponding to regular regions show strong accumulation , the level spacing statistics obeys the distribution formula ( [ eq:4.6 ] ) with @xmath120 , and shows deviations from the berry - robnik distribution .",
