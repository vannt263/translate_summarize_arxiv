    "we are now widely believed to have entered an era of precision cosmology ( e.g. percival et al .",
    "2001 ; spergel et al . 2003 ) .",
    "it is therefore important that all new surveys , and all new equipment designed to make these surveys , are able to make precision measurements .",
    "these measurements should not only improve on the current constraints on the cosmological parameters but also begin to seriously constrain the equation of state of dark energy and its evolution with cosmic epoch .",
    "these constraints will eventually distinguish between a cosmological constant and other models for dark energy such as quintessence ( e.g. carroll , press & turner 1992 ; caldwell , dave & steinhardt 1998 ) .",
    "recently , much effort has been expended to establish the best way of determining the properties of dark energy .",
    "several methods have been proposed : the use of type ia supernovae to probe the luminosity distance ( e.g. weller & albrecht 2002 ) ; the use of cluster number counts ( haiman , mohr & holder 2001 ) or counts of galaxies ( newman & davis 2000 ) ; weak gravitational lensing ( cooray & huterer 1999 ) ; the alcock - paczynski test ( ballinger , peacock & heavens 1996 ) ; and the cmb ( e.g. douspis et al . 2003 ) . in this paper",
    "we examine one method in particular , the ` standard ruler ' method based on baryonic oscillations ( eisenstein 2002 ) , as several authors ( blake & glazebrook 2003 ; hu & haiman 2003 ; seo & eisenstein 2003 ) have argued that it suffers from a set of systematic errors that are much less serious than those of the other methods .",
    "we investigate here the rle in dark energy studies of future radio surveys of neutral hydrogen ( hi ) .",
    "such surveys are likely to reach full fruition with the proposed next - generation radio synthesis array , the square kilometre array ( ska ; carilli & rawlings 2004 ) .    in sec.2",
    "we describe how we would be able to detect hi at high redshifts with future radio surveys .",
    "there are no direct observations of hi in emission in the high - redshift universe as the current radio telescopes used to search for hi in emission are only sensitive enough to reach redshifts of around 0.2 ( zwaan , van dokkum & verheijen 2001 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we have evidence of large amounts of high - redshift hi through the damped - ly@xmath12 objects seen in absorption in quasar optical spectra ( storrie - lombardi & wolfe 2000 ; peroux et al .",
    "in sec.3 we use this information to constrain possible evolutions of the hi mass function and produce a new calculation of the number density of hi galaxies to be detected by future radio telescopes which improve on previous estimates ( briggs 1999 ; van der hulst 1999 ) .",
    "we compare our ` best guess ' evolutionary model with other observational constraints in sec.4 ; fitting formulae are given in appendix a1 .",
    "having an estimate of what future radio surveys will be able to see in the 21-cm line of hi in emission , we can see what cosmological tests we can perform on such data and decide on their pros and cons .",
    "we focus here on probing dark energy with the baryonic oscillations method but other cosmological experiments are possible ( see blake et al .",
    "2004 ; rawlings et al .",
    "in sec.5 we show that , given the likely capabilities of future radio telescopes , the optimal survey would be an ` all hemisphere survey ' of all the sky area available .",
    "we then compute what comoving cosmological volume and numbers of sources are likely to be available in such surveys and we estimate the accuracy that the baryonic oscillations ` standard ruler ' method ( e.g. blake & glazebrook 2003 ; hu & haiman 2003 ; seo & eisenstein 2003 ) can give us in measuring the equation of state of dark energy ; this is typically described by the parameter @xmath13 ( turner & white 1997 ) , where @xmath14 is the pressure and @xmath15 is the energy density of the dark energy component .    in sec.6",
    "we discuss the uncertainties of our approach and discuss how they might influence the results of the standard ruler method used .",
    "we also discuss how the results would change if different assumptions are made for key features of the future radio surveys as well as some potential problems in using this method with future radio survey data .    for this paper",
    "we adopt the following cosmological values : @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we use the matter power spectrum given in bardeen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) with a normalisation given by the wmap results ( spergel et al . 2003 ) which corresponds to @xmath19 . for a given type of matter",
    "@xmath20 we define @xmath21 as being the ratio of the density of @xmath20 to the critical density of the universe today .",
    "when we refer to volumes , lengths , etc , we consider comoving cosmological values unless specified otherwise .    unless stated otherwise if we mention the field of view ( _ fov _ ) of a radio telescope / array we are referring to the instantaneous field of view this instrument possesses , and can image , at 1.4 ghz .",
    "it is vital to remember that for many radio telescopes the field of view which can be imaged gets larger at lower frequencies .",
    "the ratio of the signal to the noise power in a single - polarisation radio receiver is    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the effective collective area of the telescope ( incorporating all inefficiencies ) , @xmath24 is the flux density , @xmath25 is the bandwidth and @xmath26 is the system temperature ( incorporating all contributions ) .    in this paper",
    "we will scale all limiting sensitivities to that expected for the ska",
    ". the ska science requirements ( jones 2004 ) demand @xmath27 over the frequency range 0.5 to 5 ghz .",
    "as the discussions in this paper will be limited to hi at redshifts @xmath28 , i.e. frequencies in the range 0.5 to 1.4 ghz , this means that we can write the ` radiometry equation ' for the ska in a very simple form , namely    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the rms sensitivity for dual - polarisation observations with the ska and the @xmath31 term allows for the increase in sensitivity by averaging independent measurements of the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "neutral hydrogen ( hi ) will be found in emission with future radio surveys via the 21-cm line radiation due to the difference in energy in hyperfine atomic structure ( e.g. field 1958 ) . from atomic physics we know that the emissivity is    @xmath32    where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the rest - frame frequency and einstein a coefficient for this transition respectively",
    ", @xmath35 is the line profile of the 21-cm line which is considered here as a delta function , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the total number of hydrogen atoms , and number of atoms in the upper ( level 2 ) respectively",
    ".    we can write @xmath38 .",
    "the first ratio is given by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the number of atoms in level 1 and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the statistical weights for these levels .",
    "@xmath43 is the so called spin temperature and is an effective temperature resulting from the coupling of the cmb temperature @xmath44 and the kinetic temperature @xmath45 of the gas . in the case of the cmb radiation alone",
    "the spin temperature will equal the cmb temperature .",
    "if we have any collisional excitation or scattering by ly@xmath12 photons the spin temperature will couple to the kinetic temperature as well as the cmb temperature and will therefore be a weighted average of both ( rohlfs & wilson 1999 ) . in cases we are considering here ( dense clouds )",
    "we have both the kinetic temperature and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature much larger than @xmath46 and , given that @xmath47 , we have @xmath48 .",
    "observations show that @xmath43 can be as large as 300 k in low - redshift galaxies ( chengalur & kanekar 2000 ) and that in damped - ly@xmath12 objects at higher redshifts , limits on hi absorption lines imply larger values of @xmath43 of order of 1000 k or more ( kanekar & chengalur 2003 ) .",
    "if we are dealing with hi in emission we will get the same signal whatever @xmath43 , however the fact that the spin temperature is higher at higher redshifts is telling us that we are probably probing a different kind of interstellar medium . at high redshift we are typically probing a warm neutral intergalactic medium that is present in larger fraction in smaller less dense dark - matter halos ( young & knezek 1989 ) .",
    "we can safely say that in all cases of our interest @xmath49 .    if we consider a cloud of hydrogen , the monochromatic luminosity we would get from this 21-cm line emission will be    @xmath50    so , given the expression for the monochromatic flux density @xmath51 ( peacock 1999 ; eqn 3.87 ) , where @xmath52 is the luminosity distance to the galaxy",
    ", we can integrate eqn.4 over frequency to obtain    @xmath53    and therefore obtain the expression for the mass corresponding to the flux seen in our observations , namely    @xmath54    where the integral is now over @xmath55 , the line - of - sight width corresponding to the projected circular velocity of the galaxy . in more useful units",
    "@xmath56    noting that the factor of ( 1+z ) arises as @xmath57 needs to be multiplied by @xmath58 to produce an integrated line flux .",
    "we have neglected hi self - absorption effects which means that the hi mass may be a slight underestimate but this is likely to be a problem only when the disks of the largest galaxies seen close to edge on ( rao , turnshek & briggs 1995 ) .",
    "the hipass survey ( ryan - weber et al . 2002 ) , used channels of velocity width @xmath59 km / s and was capable of detecting typical galaxies out to @xmath60 .",
    "it is important that the @xmath61 chosen for an hi survey is not larger than the velocity width of the object being observed because this would result both in loss of signal - to - noise ratio and the danger of mistaking signal for interference .",
    "the hipass survey does not show any evidence that many sources have low velocity width and the very lowest velocities found are around 30 km / s . these widths might change systematically with redshift .",
    "zwaan et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have detected an example of a hi rich cloud at @xmath62 with a velocity profile of width @xmath63 60 km / s .",
    "we take @xmath64 30 km / s but caution that even finer velocity bins may prove necessary to avoid losing signal - to - noise ratio on the narrowest - line objects , particularly if line width correlates negatively with redshift . the current ` strawman design ' for the ska ( jones 2004 ) suggests channels of width @xmath65 will be available .",
    "we assume throughout that hi lines are detected and measured using optimal smoothing techniques .    in the standard picture of galaxy formation ( e.g. rees & ostriker 1977 ; white & rees 1978 ) , we expect dark - matter halos to form potential wells , with gas falling into these potential wells becoming shock heated to the virial temperature .",
    "cooling can then occur if the free - fall timescale is longer than the cooling timescale .",
    "dekel & silk ( 1986 ) have showed that the objects that can cool have circular velocities in between 10 km / s and 200 km / s .",
    "further to this , it is argued that objects with circular velocity between 10 km / s and 30 km / s are likely to be totally dark as their potential wells are so shallow that the cold gas will disappear by evaporation due to photo - ionisation ( dekel 2004 ) .",
    "these theoretical arguments lead us to do our calculations with an assumed @xmath61 = 30 km / s which means that only objects with the lowest circular velocities and with nearly face - on rotating disks will have hi line profiles with @xmath66 .    in every @xmath61 = 30 km / s channel",
    "there will be a root - mean - square noise that will be dependent on frequency @xmath67 , estimated for the ska to be @xmath4 2 @xmath68jy at @xmath69 ghz ( hi at @xmath70 ) to @xmath4 4 @xmath68jy at @xmath71 mhz ( hi at @xmath72 ) for a 4-hour pointed observation .",
    "we denote this noise by @xmath73 .",
    "we assume that the average hydrogen - rich galaxy has a rectangular line - of - sight velocity spread @xmath74 km / s ( which corresponds to a circular velocity of around 200 km / s ) at @xmath70 and we also assume a ` tully - fisher - like ' relationship @xmath75 ( peacock 1999 ; p.622 ) that would hold at higher redshift , where @xmath76 is the dark - matter mass of the galaxy and @xmath77 is the galaxy radius .",
    "the evolution we choose for @xmath76 and @xmath77 with redshift is explained in sec .",
    "3.2 and this will impose a corresponding scaling of @xmath55 with @xmath78 ; this choice will in fact force the line width to correlate negatively with redshift ( as @xmath79 ) although the physical lower limit of 30 km / s proposed by dekel ( 2004 ) should mean that this can not decrease without limit for halos containing hi .",
    "then the limiting hi mass that a radio survey will be able to detect at redshift @xmath78 is    @xmath80    where @xmath81 is the signal - to - noise level we choose to yield a robust detection , @xmath82 is the integration time in hours for a given @xmath1 and @xmath83 is the fraction of the sensitivity relative to the ska ; by definition @xmath84 for the ska , and current radio telescopes have @xmath85 .      currently the ` strawman design ' for the ska ( jones 2004 ) has a _ fov _ of at least 1 @xmath86 . for most realisations of an ska",
    ", the field of view will be much larger at frequencies smaller than 1.4 ghz , which will correspond to hi at redshifts larger than @xmath87 .",
    "in fact the field of view , in units of @xmath86 , will typically ( e.g. because it is controlled by the diffraction limit of a dish ) grow as @xmath88 if we are probing hi at increasing redshift .",
    "in sec.5 we will consider future telescopes where the field of view for hi galaxies may vary with a different power of the frequency / redshift .",
    "so , let us consider for illustrative purposes that we have a square beam and that we would like to cover a square sky patch of 64 @xmath86 with an integration time of 8 hours per square degree . if we simply point the telescope 64 times at each square that we will name a1,a2 ...",
    "h7,h8 then we will have covered the sky smoothly at @xmath70 but the data at @xmath89 will have parts of the sky that will have a higher sensitivity than others .",
    "this would be an undesired feature in the data for the purposes of making a uniform survey of hi .    in order to deal with this",
    ", we consider the following . instead of pointing the telescope at each of a1,a2 ,",
    "... we take data _",
    "times in between a1 and a2 with 1/_n _ th of the total time we would have spent on each of a1 and a2 .",
    "we can then take the data that we receive from each small pointing and add it to the data available from other pointings .",
    "we end up with a survey with increasing sensitivity for increasing redshifts because a source at higher redshift will be accessible to a larger fraction of the pointings and will therefore have a longer effective integration time for higher - redshift objects .",
    "in fact the effective integration time for such a ` tiled ' survey will increase smoothly as @xmath88 for a given integration time at @xmath70 .",
    "ideally we would like to have a very smooth survey but in practise it may not possible to obtain maps with very large _",
    "n _ because of limited computing capabilities .",
    "the wiggles on the power spectrum are at intervals of @xmath90 @xmath91 so the survey needs to have a smooth window function even on scales corresponding to @xmath92 . if this is not the case the wiggles will be smoothed out by correlated errors on the power spectrum estimation ( see blake & glazebrook 2003 ) .",
    "thus for the purposes of this experiment we would like to have a smooth sky map on sizes of @xmath93 mpc . the choice of @xmath94 would ensure that smoothness is achieved on scales of the same size as the wiggles at the redshifts ( @xmath95 ) of interest .",
    "we also would not have excessive data storage requirements as the integration time would be of the order of minutes similar to those used in current radio surveys .",
    "more complicated survey schemes will be needed with interferometric arrays to ensure optimal uv coverage .",
    "so , for a given time of survey per square degree the limiting mass that the ska will be able to see is    @xmath96    where we have assumed that all redshifts are accessible by a single pointing and where @xmath14 is defined by the field of view changing with frequency @xmath67 as @xmath97 ; i.e. for a @xmath98 dependence we have @xmath99 .",
    "as we are covering a certain patch of the sky , the centre of this patch will have the sensitivity given by eqn .",
    "9 , but the corners of the survey will have lower sensitivities as the beam will not have covered those areas as often as those in the centre .",
    "this will be the case for most of the survey area if we are looking at a small patch of the sky but if we are performing a large survey then this area with smaller sensitivity will be a small fraction of the total area of the survey , and can be neglected .",
    "we will show in sec.5 that the optimal survey for this experiment is an all - sky - survey , so this effect should therefore be negligible .",
    "the assumption that the field of view changes with redshift will make a big difference to the total cosmic volume being surveyed in a given length of time and this assumption is relaxed in sec.5 where we will consider different values of @xmath14 .",
    "we consider the local mass function of hi ( zwaan et al .",
    "2003 ) @xmath100 in units of @xmath101 .",
    "the number of sources viewed assuming that this mass function is constant in @xmath78 will be    @xmath102    where @xmath103 is the limiting mass that can be detected ; this quantity is plotted in fig . 1 in which the gain in sensitivity at high redshifts from a ` tiled ' survey is made clear .",
    "this assumes , however , that the hi mass function is constant throughout all redshifts which is clearly very unlikely to be correct as neutral hydrogen is constantly being used in star formation , ionised in processes such as supernovae explosions as well as being created in processes like cooling flows ( e.g. white & frenk 1991 ) .",
    "we therefore have to try and see how this hi mass function evolves with redshift to have a clearer idea of what number density will be accessible by surveys with next - generation radio telescopes .",
    "this is the purpose of sec.3 where we assume that the hi observed traces collapsed dark - matter halos .      in the previous sections we have assumed that a source in the sky has a flux that will be detected perfectly by the radio telescope",
    "this is not the case if the survey is done with an interferometer . since the output of the correlator observing an extended radio source on certain baselines does not recover the total flux density .",
    "we only recover the ` correlated flux density ' which is the modulus of the complex visibility of each baseline .    here",
    "we estimate the signal that we lose if we do such surveys with an interferometer .",
    "we will assume that our average galaxy has a physical radius @xmath104 at redshift 0 .",
    "we assume that the dark - matter mass of a typical galaxy halo changes as @xmath105 according to the hierarchical growth of halos ( press & schechter 1978 ) and that the characteristic density @xmath106 of a halo changes as @xmath107 ; i.e. that the density of the collapsed galaxy changes in the same way as the background density of dark matter . in the standard picture of disk formation ( e.g. peebles 1969 ; fall & efstathiou 1980 ) we expect the disk of a galaxy to be a factor of @xmath108 smaller than the radius of the dark - matter halo , where @xmath108 is the spin parameter and can be taken as a constant ( efstathiou & jones 1979 ) . now given that @xmath109 we can approximate the proper radius of an average galaxy as    @xmath110    where our choice of @xmath111 is explained in sec .",
    "this will impose an evolution of the characteristic sizes of disks with redshift that is proportional to @xmath112 ; this is in rough agreement with observations of disk sizes from the hubble deep field ( e.g. poli et al .",
    "1999 ; giallongo et al .",
    "other prescriptions for the evolution of the disk sizes could have been used ( e.g. ferguson et al . 2003 ) but this would not have made a large difference to our calculations .",
    "we use a characteristic size scale for an hi disk in a galaxy at the break of the hi mass function at redshift @xmath70 of @xmath77 = 15 kpc ( salpeter & hoffman 1996 ) .",
    "we will assume that the galaxy has a surface brightness that corresponds to a 2-d gaussian profile with angular spread equal to @xmath113 in radians , where @xmath114 is the angular diameter distance to the galaxy .",
    "the fourier transform of this gaussian will be the complex visibility of each baseline . the spread of this fourier transform is    @xmath115    so each antenna , when correlated with other antennas , will only be sensitive to a fraction of the total flux of the source , depending on the baseline .",
    "obviously we need to assume a certain configuration for the antennas .",
    "we adopt a composite array ( see jones 2004 ) in which the interferometer will be configured with 20% of the collecting area inside a diameter of @xmath4 1 km , 50% of the collecting area within a diameter of @xmath4 5 km , 75% of the collecting area within a diameter of @xmath4 150 km and the final 25% spread over a diameter of 3000 km in a scale - free configuration ( conway 1998 ) .",
    "we illustrate how much the configuration affects the fraction of the flux detected by plotting the number of sources seen with different configurations ( figs 2 & 3 ) .",
    "the fraction of flux detected from sources improves rapidly as the source moves to larger redshift and has smaller angular size , and is therefore visible to a greater fraction of the interferometer baselines .",
    "as seen in fig.3 it is vital that a large fraction of the collecting area is in short baselines so that we do not ` resolve out ' extended sources and miss most of the hi galaxies in a survey .",
    "if we perform a survey and take data out to redshift @xmath116 we would need to cover frequencies from 1.4 ghz down to 560 mhz ; with channels of width 30 km / s , we would have data in roughly 10000 channels .",
    "a survey over half of the sky at a resolution corresponding to @xmath117 arcsec would have about 20000 square degrees , so we therefore would have around @xmath118 pixels in the sky .",
    "our survey would therefore have around @xmath119 pixels in 3-d .",
    "we would therefore require a 8-@xmath120 catalogue in order not to have any spurious sources if the noise was perfectly gaussian .",
    "nevertheless , we expect to find sources of noise that will not be so well behaved .",
    "we therefore adopt a signal - to - noise level of 10@xmath120 for our calculations . in this way",
    ", we can be reasonably confident that our catalogue will be largely free of spurious sources .",
    "we note that the hipass bcg ( bright galaxy catalogue ; ryan - weber et al .",
    "2002 ) is a 9@xmath120 catalogue , and the number of pixels , in 3-d , in their survey is only @xmath121 given that they perform a survey out to 13000 km / s , have a resolution of around 13 km / s and survey half the sky with a resolution of order 15 arcmin .",
    "we therefore conclude that depending on the sources of systematic errors , it might be necessary in a real survey to have a much higher detection level if we want the catalogue to be free of spurious sources ( possibly higher than 10@xmath120 ) .",
    "we stress that such a change would not affect our results significantly .",
    "the number density of hi sources we will be able to detect will be a direct function of the evolution of the mass function of neutral hydrogen . if we are able to construct a reasonable model that would predict this mass function at high redshift we would be able to have a good estimate of the number of sources that will be detected .",
    "if we perform an hi survey out to cosmological redshifts we will be sensitive mainly to objects near the break of the mass function . in the following sections we use scaling relations according to the properties of such galaxies",
    "( i.e. we assume that the population at all redshifts have such properties ) .",
    "we will estimate the hi mass function at high redshifts but we are not too concerned if the low - mass objects are not correctly described .    in order to calculate the hi mass function at higher redshifts , we use damped - ly@xmath12 results as a probe .",
    "the current sensitivity of radio telescopes limit the detection of hi in emission to only @xmath122 ( zwaan et al .",
    "2001 ) , so we can only probe high-@xmath78 objects in absorption .",
    "the damped - ly@xmath12 systems give us a distribution of the number density of objects as a function of the column density as well as the total @xmath123 at each redshift .",
    "one might think that by looking at the distribution of column densities at high redshift we could find the distribution in mass at high z. there is indeed a correlation between high column density and high mass but the scatter is extremely large ( ryan - weber et al .",
    "2003 ) because small clouds with not much hi can have lines of sight passing through their dense cores giving a high column density and hi - rich galaxies can have lines of sight passing through their low - column - density regions . we can not obtain directly a mass function from the distributions in column density , but we argue that the highest column densities are mainly in collapsed structures ( see sec.4 ) , and they account for most of the mass of neutral hydrogen ( peroux et al .",
    "the total density of neutral gas at high redshift is the vital information that damped - ly@xmath12 systems give us , and this , of course directly constrains the hi - mass - weighted area under the hi mass function .",
    "we will assume that the mass function of hi can be described as a schechter function at higher redshifts and that all the hydrogen seen in damped - ly@xmath12 systems is in collapsed halos at high redshift ( see sec.4 ) .",
    "it is not known whether this assumption is valid at higher redshifts , but we are confident that this is a reasonable approximation at least up to the redshifts in which we are interested .",
    "we therefore have three parameters to determine at every redshift : the normalisation @xmath124 , the faint - end slope @xmath12 and the break of the mass function @xmath125 .",
    "all our calculations use the redshift - zero hi mass function measured by the hipass team ( zwaan et al .",
    "in their paper they parametrise the hi mass function by a schechter function , namely    @xmath126    where @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 @xmath101 ( zwaan et al . 2003 ) .",
    "we assume that the faint - end slope will not play a big rle in determining the number of sources to be seen .",
    "we keep this value constant and equal to the value ( @xmath127 ) seen at @xmath70 .",
    "the value of the normalisation is set according to the amount of gas found at redshift @xmath78 following the results from damped - ly@xmath12 observations ( peroux et al .",
    "2001 ) ; we assume that the neutral gas in these damped - ly@xmath12 clouds is in collapsed objects .",
    "the integral of the hi mass times the hi mass function equals the total density of neutral gas and is given by damped - ly@xmath12 results ( see eqn.14 ) .",
    "nevertheless , recent results show that if we could select quasars in the radio we might infer a higher amount of hi because there might be an obscuration selection effect in finding neutral gas via damped systems selected in the optical ( ellison et al .",
    "we therefore multiply the peroux et al .",
    "( 2001 ) results by a small factor ( namely 1.5 ; ellison et al .",
    "2001 ) to account for this potential selection effect .",
    "we then fit a function to force the normalisation of our hi mass function to account for the amount of gas that must be present at that redshift ; this is done by forcing the integral under the hi mass function ( weighted by @xmath130 ) to equal that measured by the damped - ly@xmath12 results .",
    "we point out here that we have ignored the weak constraints on @xmath131 from rao & turnshek ( 2000 ) who predicted a larger amount of neutral gas at @xmath132 on the basis of objects selected via mgii absorption and followed up with the hst to obtain damped - ly@xmath12 measurements ; their constraints are uncertain because of small number statistics , but also because there are numerous systematic effects that may not yet have been completely understood ( rao & turnshek 2000 ) . from peroux",
    "( 2001 ) we have    @xmath133    which leads to    @xmath134    where @xmath135 is the gamma function and @xmath136 is the critical density of the universe ; we have used the schechter function as the form of the hi mass function .",
    "the only thing left to choose is how the break of this mass function will evolve in cosmic time .",
    "this is not well constrained by current data and can make a significant difference to our results . if we adopt the standard hierarchical formation scenario , where smaller objects merge to produce bigger objects , one would naively expect that this break would shift to lower masses at higher redshifts . nevertheless , the problem is not so simple .",
    "there are many other processes that may lead to the opposite result .",
    "for example , if star formation is more efficient in hydrogen - rich objects then they will tend to form stars at a higher rate than their lower - mass counterparts . in this case , if star formation is the main process the break could shift towards higher hi masses at higher redshifts",
    ".    a complete theory of galaxy formation would be able to give us the answer to this problem .",
    "we do not however possess such a theory .",
    "we therefore will make three extreme choices for the change in the break . in model",
    "a we consider a break that remains constant throughout all redshifts . in model b",
    "we consider the case where @xmath137 : in this choice we are assuming that the hi follows a hierarchical formation in the same way that dark matter clusters . in this model",
    "b we use the fact that the press - schechter mass function ( press & schechter 1974 ) is roughly self - similar in @xmath138 $ ] ( jenkins et al .",
    "2001 ) where @xmath139 is the variance of the density field ( at z = 0 ) smoothed over a cosmic volume corresponding to mass @xmath140 , @xmath141 is the linear growth factor and @xmath142 is the linear theory threshold for collapse ( lokas & hoffman 2001 ) .",
    "if we consider a change such that @xmath143 remains constant we can see how a characteristic mass of dark matter changes with redshift .",
    "in fact @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the slope of the power spectrum at the scales of interest .",
    "we choose @xmath146 since this is appropriate for galaxy scales ( peacock 1999 ; p. 499 ) .",
    "we can roughly say that @xmath147 in this model . with this choice",
    ", the scaling of the average radius of a disk with redshift according to eqn.11 would be roughly @xmath148 , a scaling of galaxy sizes with redshift that is often simply assumed ( e.g. silk & bouwens 1999 ) .",
    "the assumption that @xmath137 is not the most physically reasonable assumption we could make .",
    "in fact model b is an extreme case , the function of which is only to provide a limit to our predictions .",
    "the main reason for this is that this model neglects the effects of star formation over a range of cosmic epochs .",
    "however , we also know that this assumption must break down in high - mass halos ( e.g. rich clusters ) where the ratio of @xmath130 to @xmath76 is much lower than in galaxies ( battye , davis & weller 2004 ) .",
    "this is due , at least in part , to the long - established fact that the mass - to - light ratio is larger in the most massive halos due to long cooling timescales , but it may also reflect a reduction in neutral content once galaxies become sub - halos of a larger dark - matter halo ( e.g. zwaan et al .",
    "2001 ) . in extrapolating correctly to high redshift we would need to account for times",
    "when these sub - halos were distinct halos , this would make the location of the break of the hi mass function move to lower masses less rapidly than model b.    in model c we consider the case where @xmath149 .",
    "once more , this neglects the sub - halo problem but it does attempt to take account of the star formation .",
    "we assume that outflows will reduce the fraction of baryons in a galaxy but accretion will bring the fraction back close to the nucleosynthesis value or some relatively fixed value of it ( silk 2003 ) ; a steady state between these two processes would bring the ratio of baryons to dark matter to a constant value . in this case",
    "we can say that @xmath150 m_{\\rm dm}$ ] , where @xmath151 is given by    @xmath152    and where the star formation rate @xmath153 as a function of cosmic time is taken from choudhury & padmanabhan ( 2002 ) and corrected to the cosmology we use here [ @xmath154 is the hubble constant at redshift @xmath78 ] .",
    "the choice of @xmath156 is more complex . from young & knezek ( 1989 )",
    "we know that the ratio of molecular hydrogen ( @xmath157 ) to neutral hydrogen ( hi ) is a function of the galaxy type varying by a factor @xmath158 depending on type .",
    "however young & knezek argued that the largest ratios ( @xmath159 ) are found in the most massive galaxies with deepest potential wells that correspond to dense stellar cores with low spin temperatures .",
    "less massive galaxies have a smaller proportion of molecular hydrogen ( @xmath160 ) and have less dense cores with high spin temperature .",
    "we can not implement this in a completely consistent way in our model c , so we decide to choose a ratio so that @xmath161 which is consistent with the local baryon budget ( fukugita , hogan & peebles 1998 ) .",
    "we also neglect the ionised fraction of gas in a galaxy i.e. ( @xmath162 ) which is a reasonable assumption for collapsed galaxy - sized halos ( fukugita et al .",
    "1998 ) . in model",
    "c the break of the hi mass function will still shift toward smaller hi masses at higher redshifts , but more slowly than model b as it takes account the fact that galaxies at higher redshifts have more gas and less stars .",
    "we plot in fig.5 the differential number density @xmath163 of objects seen , per @xmath86 , by a future ska - like telescope for our models a , b and c ; we also plot the number density with a hi mass function that does not evolve with redshift .",
    "we can see that the evidence from damped - ly@xmath12 systems for more hi in collapsed objects ( sec .",
    "3.1 ) predicts a larger number density of hi - emitting objects .",
    "we also see that considering a different break in the hi mass function makes some difference to the amount of objects seen . even though we tried to choose very different possible alternatives we see that there is not a huge difference in the total number of hi sources .",
    "there are two reasons for this : first , if we consider a change in the position of the break of the hi mass function and still consider that the total hi mass is the same at a given redshift the model with a lower break will have a lot more low - mass objects to account for the same mass at that redshift . if we have a survey that has enough sensitivity to reach those masses we will see those objects .",
    "second , the change in the break becomes significant only at higher redshifts and these redshifts are probed at longer integration times .",
    "we can therefore say that for low integration times the total number of hi sources is uncertain to a factor of only @xmath164 ( see fig.5 ) .    although different breaks in the hi mass function give roughly the same amount of sources they yield surveys probing significantly different volumes in space .",
    "we will define the depth of our survey ( @xmath165 ) carefully in sec.5.2 , but we can already see ( fig.5 ) that , for a 4-hour integration time , model a probes redshifts as high as 2.1 , whereas model b only probes redshifts as high as 1.0 .",
    "model c , chosen to have a break in between the breaks for models a and b , probes out to redshift 1.5",
    ".    our preferred model in the next sections will be model c. in sec.6 we will quantify how much longer or shorter a survey will take if the hi mass function is closer to models a or b ( or if we have an evolution that mimics the no - evolution scenario ) instead of model c in order to get the same cosmological constraints on @xmath8 .",
    "in sec . 3 we tried to see how the hi mass function could change with redshift .",
    "we stress here that we are only concerned whether the objects near the break of this mass function are well described as they are the ones that will dominate future surveys at the redshifts of interest .",
    "we have assume that an average galaxy at @xmath70 has a radius of @xmath415 kpc and a circular velocity of 200 km / s .",
    "we have also assumed scaling relations that describe their behaviour at higher redshift .",
    "we have assumed no scatter on these relations .    to obtain an expression for the normalisation of the mass function we have assumed in sec.3.2 that damped - ly@xmath12 systems are collapsed objects with radii of the same size as galaxies at the redshifts they are observed .",
    "if we assume that the path length through the absorber is roughly @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the column density and @xmath168 is the hi number density and @xmath169 to be the ratio of the density in baryons in a collapsed halo to the universal density of baryons ( e.g. from nucleosynthesis ) , we have @xmath170 ( peacock 1999 ; page 365 ) and this means that the most extreme damped systems ( @xmath171 ) are consistent with having the dimensions of galactic disks : at @xmath172 the damped systems would have radii of around 1 - 10 kpc .",
    "this is not the case for much lower column density systems .",
    "nevertheless the total mass obtained by integrating the damped - ly@xmath12 systems over column density is mainly due to high column density objects ( peroux et al .",
    "2001 ) , i.e. those that are most likely to be collapsed and to have the sizes of galactic disks .    when a blind hi survey is made in the local universe , it is reported that the essentially all of the galaxies found have optical counterparts ( ryan - weber et al .",
    "if a large fraction of the gas were in non - collapsed objects at higher redshifts then this would reduce significantly the number of detections by a future survey .",
    "there have been searches at low redshifts for large clouds of gas with high mass and very low column density ( minchin et al .",
    "2003 ) ; these searches have found no large clouds with low column density , and have also found that all collapsed galaxies detected in hi have an average column density @xmath173 to @xmath174 . in ryan - weber et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , a sample of 34 galaxies from this hipass survey were observed at higher spatial resolution so that the column density could be computed at each point of each galaxy .",
    "the resulting column density distribution is similar to those in to damped - ly@xmath12 results ( peroux et al . 2001 ) , allowing for an increase in normalisation for the reasons outlined in sec.3 . , but in this case we know that the galaxies in hipass are in collapsed objects .",
    "this is strong evidence that the hi found in blind surveys traces the dark - matter potential wells in a similar way to the baryons , and this suggests that the hi found at high redshift is likely to be in collapsed objects such as young galaxies .    in our model c",
    "we have assumed that the mass in baryons in a galaxy follows the dark - matter mass .",
    "observationally , there is compelling evidence that this is the case if we look at the tully - fisher relation in spirals .",
    "mcgaugh et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have shown the tully - fisher relation obtained using only the stellar component of spiral galaxies has a break at around 90 km / s but this break disappears if , instead of considering just the stellar population , they use the total baryonic mass of the galaxy composed of gas plus stars .",
    "they get a very good fit for both ends of their data , i.e. for low and high circular velocities .",
    "this baryonic tully - fisher relation has the following implication : the mass of gas plus stars is directly proportional to the mass in dark matter , and any other dark component is unlikely to be important as it would introduce too much scatter .",
    "if we look at the blue luminosity function of galaxies at redshift @xmath172 , we can use scaling relations in order to estimate whether it is consistent with model c. we crudely assume that the blue luminosity density is proportional to the star formation rate at each epoch .",
    "therefore , the ratio of the breaks of the hi mass function and the blue luminosity function should be in proportion to the ratio of @xmath131 to the star formation rate . given that we have an estimate of the star formation rate and the density of neutral hydrogen at @xmath172 ( sec .",
    "3.2 ) , we can infer the position of the break of the @xmath172 hi mass function by knowing the position of the break of the @xmath172 luminosity function of blue galaxies : this has been taken from combo-17 ( chris wolf ; private communication based on the data from wolf et al .",
    "we plot and compare this model with our models a , b and c. we can see from fig.6 that models a and c are clearly preferred by this comparison .",
    "in fact at redshift @xmath172 our models a and c give essentially the same prediction for the hi mass function , as can be inferred from the similar @xmath163 for these two models over the redshift range @xmath175 .",
    "in our model we assume that the average dark - matter halo in a galaxy at the break of the hi mass function is smaller at higher redshifts according to hierarchical processes but , on the other hand , these galaxies have less stars and are more gaseous .",
    "so , if we take galaxies at @xmath72 , their average luminosity will be roughly proportional to the stars in that galaxy which will be approximately @xmath176 l^{\\star}$ ] so , at @xmath177 , these galaxies would be , assuming no scatter , 50-times fainter optically than @xmath178 ( i.e. objects at the break of the optical schechter luminosity function ) .",
    "deep near - infrared imaging with the hst typically fails to detect stellar counterparts to damped - ly@xmath12 objects ( warren et al .",
    "2001 ) to limits which are consistent with our rough calculation based on model c.    it is also well known that it is very hard to find known damped - ly@xmath12 systems in hi absorption in the radio .",
    "this is also in agreement with model c as , at high redshifts , this predicts smaller gas rich - clouds with shallower gravitational potentials and consisting mainly of a warm neutral medium that has a high spin temperature ( kanekar & chengalur 2003 ) . because of the high spin temperature it will be hard to find these objects in absorption in the radio until we have instruments with the sensitivity of the ska .",
    "finally , there has been searches for h@xmath12 lines associated with star formation in damped - ly@xmath12 systems , but typically no line flux is found .",
    "this can impose ( assuming a negligible dust obscuration ) a maximum star formation rate ( sfr ) which would correspond to 11.4 - 36.7@xmath179 for the studied objects ( bunker et al .",
    "1999 ) . since our break for the hi mass function moves towards the left for our preferred model c",
    ", the star formation rate in high-@xmath78 objects would be lower than in galaxies at the break of the low-@xmath78 hi mass function .",
    "we therefore would not expect any line flux to be detected is such searches as the sfr is likely to be too low to produce a robust detection , so these results are also in agreement with model c. nevertheless , if we do have a star formation @xmath180 , we would have an associated continuum emission in the radio of @xmath181 at redshift @xmath177 ( condon 1992 ) , and we will trivially be able to detect this level of emission with ska - like instruments ( eqn.2 ) .",
    "in fact the continuum emission is only a factor of 15 fainter than the corresponding line emission .",
    "good band - pass calibration will therefore be essential for the line detection of star - forming galaxies , particularly those that may , because of inevitable scatter , have a continuum flux of the same order of magnitude as the 21-cm line emission .",
    "we have to stress here that model c is basically taking the known population of hi - emitting objects at @xmath70 and trying to see what they would look like at higher redshift .",
    "it is likely though that there will be another population of hi - emitting objects which would be the sub - units of large elliptical galaxies today .",
    "these sub - units would probably have been hi - rich in the high-@xmath78 universe , before they merged to form large elliptical galaxy and before they became part of large dark - matter halos such as groups and clusters .",
    "we think , nevertheless , that these objects would still be rare at redshifts around @xmath182 .",
    "first , given the colour information on elliptical galaxies found in observations ( bower , lucey & ellis 1992 ) , it is argued that most of the stars in giant elliptical galaxies must have been formed at redshifts higher than 1.5 to explain their consistently red colours .",
    "second , a population of extremely red objects ( eros ) is now well established at @xmath182 ( e.g. daddi , cimatti & renzini 2000 ) which look to be progenitors of nearby ellipticals , and which appear to be red because of the old stellar populations as was first demonstrated for @xmath182 radio galaxies ( dunlop et al .",
    "third , if such a population exists it is likely that they would appear as large spiral galaxies at @xmath182 but observationally ( wolfe et al .",
    "1985 ) only one such example has been detected as a damped - ly@xmath12 system at @xmath183 .",
    "most damped - ly@xmath12 objects are consistent with being smaller galaxies with a warm neutral medium ( e.g. kanekar & chengalur 2003 ) which would be the precursors of the spiral population today .",
    "we neglect the elliptical population but caution that it may start to contribute significantly to the hi population at redshift @xmath184 ( sec.6 ) .",
    "we have emphasised here how the break of the hi mass function is likely to change with redshift but this change is not directly constrained by current data .",
    "however , we have discussed various observational constraints in this section which are in good agreement with our model c. if the break of the hi mass function were to stay at very high masses at higher redshifts then we would expect brighter galaxies and stronger star - formation lines associated with most damped - ly@xmath12 objects .",
    "on the other hand , if the hi break shifts towards very low masses at higher redshifts it is hard to find consistency with the blue luminosity function at @xmath172 ( fig.6 ) .",
    "finally we note that our model c is in good agreement out to @xmath185 with the predictions of semi - analytic models ; see rawlings et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for a comparison with models from cole et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and benson et al .",
    "it has been proposed in the literature by several authors ( e.g. blake & glazebrook 2003 ; hu & haiman 2003 ; seo & eisenstein 2003 ) that measuring the baryonic oscillations in the galaxy power spectrum allows a clean method of probing properties of dark energy which could be performed provided enough cosmic volume and enough tracers of this volume ( e.g. galaxies ) are available .",
    "there are two sources of error in such a power spectrum measurement .",
    "the first of these is sample or cosmic variance which is linked to the fact that the number of independent spatial modes that we can measure in a given cosmic volume is finite .",
    "this error is inversely proportional to the square root of the cosmic volume covered by a survey ( see eqn .",
    "17 ) . in the case of an hi survey with an ska - like telescope",
    "this will be determined by the area of the sky we will be able to survey and the integration time we will spend in each square degree which will in turn , constrain the maximum redshift at which we will be able to detect hi sources ( see sec .",
    "5.2 and fig . 5 ) .",
    "the other source of error is shot noise due to the imperfect sampling of the fluctuations due to the finite number of tracers in the volume . the total fractional error in the power spectrum assuming",
    "the optimised weighting scheme of feldman , kaiser & peacock ( 1994 ) is :    @xmath186    where @xmath187 is the value of the power spectrum at wavelength @xmath188 and @xmath145 is the number of sources per volume in our sample .",
    "we would like to minimise the error we get from a p(k ) measurement .",
    "this would involve designing a survey that would have maximum volume provided that there is enough sources so that the shot noise is negligible compared to the error due to cosmic variance . in order to have a negligible shot noise",
    "we would need @xmath189 ( eqn .",
    "17 ) but this would involve getting an enormous amount of sources per volume . as is argued in detail by seo & eisenstein ( 2003 ) there is not a great gain in going from @xmath190 to @xmath191 so we assume that our errors will become large compared to cosmic variance only when @xmath192 .    having @xmath190 means that @xmath193 so we have errors in the shot noise that will be small if @xmath194 : here @xmath195 is the differential number density of sources that we get from our model , and @xmath196 is the usual comoving volume element . given that , at redshifts of interest ( @xmath197 ) the ` wiggles ' in the power spectrum",
    "will have been erased by non - linear clustering for @xmath198 ( see blake & glazebrook 2003 ) , we take @xmath199 for our calculations , i.e. the position of the first wiggles in the power spectrum . we have assumed that hi galaxies have a bias that increases slowly as a function of redshift roughly as g(@xmath78 ) , from a bias of @xmath200 at low redshift : the close association at low redshifts between galaxies selected by their hi content and the normal ` late - type ' galaxy population ( e.g.  minchin et al . 2003 ) and the unit bias of this population with respect to the dark matter ( peacock et al .",
    "2001 ; verde et al .",
    "2002 ) , suggest that this assumption is reasonable .",
    "we then assume that the systematic rise in the bias cancels with the drop in the normalisation of @xmath201 .",
    "we estimate that measurements will be statistically useful until the differential number density drops below @xmath202 5000 galaxies per @xmath86 ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "this defines the maximum redshift we can probe with a given integration time .      the error on the dark - energy parameter @xmath8 will not depend only on the cosmic volume probed and the shot - noise of the experiment .",
    "it depends also on the number of wiggles probed [ which is a function of the redshifts surveyed given that non - linearities can dilute and erase these wiggles ] , represented by @xmath203 and on the strength of the test which can be represented as the distortion of the wiggle length as a function of redshift [ see fig .",
    "5 of blake & glazebrook ( 2003 ) ] .",
    "note from 1/@xmath204 dependence of eqn .",
    "17 that high-@xmath188 wiggles are easier to measure provided that they have not been diluted or even erased by non - linearities .",
    "first , we calculate the best shape for a survey so that we get the biggest volume in the smallest time",
    ". would it be a shallow survey that would cover the whole sky or a deep survey that would cover only a fraction of the sky ? in order to determine this we compute the volume surveyed by multiplying the area covered in the sky by the effective volume covered by the data . from tegmark ( 1997 )",
    "we get    @xmath205    where @xmath3 is the total time of the survey , and @xmath206 is the integration time spent per pointing , @xmath207 where @xmath208 and where @xmath209 stands for the bandwidth allowed given a particular realisation of an ska - like instrument and @xmath210 represents the frequency range corresponding to hi redshifted throughout the range of redshifts of the survey . in most ska realisations @xmath0",
    "is expected to be below one , but should not be an order of magnitude below one .",
    "we choose a survey time of one year and a @xmath1 of 1 @xmath86 , and then set the optimum integration time that will maximise @xmath55 .",
    "as we can see from fig.7 we obtain the largest volumes when we perform a shallow survey across all the available sky .",
    "nevertheless the survey with largest volume is not necessarily the best survey to probe dark energy .",
    "a survey at high redshift may have more wiggles and therefore provide a better constraint than a survey with a large volume at low redshift . in order to illustrate this we plot in fig .",
    "7 a volume weighted by @xmath203 .",
    "we stress here that this is only a toy model to illustrate that even though the test may be more efficient at high redshifts .",
    "the sensitivities and @xmath1 of the ska are such that a survey with the largest area is likely still to be the optimal survey . we expect to produce a more rigorous calculation of these effects .    if we look at fig .",
    "5 of blake & glazebrook ( 2003 ) we can see that the baryonic oscillations test is considerably weaker below a redshift of 0.5 . on the other hand",
    "we can see that even with this volume - weighted function in fig .",
    "7 the largest volume - weighted volume we obtain is for integration times that have the largest area available in the sky .",
    "all of these surveys probe redshifts larger than 0.5 , in fact as we can see from fig .",
    "8 these surveys probes volumes at least as high as @xmath211 .",
    "a survey that is designed to probe dark energy with baryonic oscillations must have a considerable volume at redshifts larger than 0.5 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the optimal way of probing large scale structure with future radio surveys with a sensitivity comparable to that of an ska will be to produce surveys that probe all the area available on the sky .",
    "we caution that this might not be the case if the telescope sensitivity is significantly lower .      the factor @xmath212 in eqn .",
    "18 will be very close to one for most redshifts where we have data and will fall sharply to zero where the hi starts to become too faint to be detected . here",
    "we consider @xmath212 as a step - down function that becomes zero at @xmath213 .",
    "we define this maximum redshift @xmath213 as the redshift where we become shot - noise limited ( i.e. @xmath190 ) which corresponds to @xmath214 .",
    "we therefore have    @xmath215    so the value of @xmath216 will determine the maximum depth to which we will be able to reproduce a galaxy power spectrum reliably .    in fig . 8 we plot the maximum redshift of a given survey with an ska - like instrument as a function of how the field of view scales with @xmath78 .",
    "there are four features of the future radio telescope that are vital in order for this survey to be optimal .",
    "the first feature is the sensitivity of the instrument . as we can see from fig . 8 , with an ska - like telescope",
    "our gain in @xmath213 starts dropping quickly as we start probing redshifts @xmath4 1.5 .",
    "we conclude that if redshifts of order 1.5 have to be reached in order to probe dark energy optimally with this survey , then a full ska - like - sensitivity is needed . as we will see in sec .",
    "5.3 this is indeed the case and the full ska will be needed to properly probe dark energy .",
    "the second and third features are the @xmath1 and @xmath0 , the useful bandwidth of the telescope , which are essentially degenerate .",
    "we can clearly see in fig.9 that although ska - like sensitivity is vital to get a large cosmic volume , the factor @xmath217 plays an equally important role .",
    "the fourth and final feature is the way the @xmath1 scales with frequency .",
    "we can see in figs 8 and 9 the effect of this choice , and show the huge advantage that is gained if the ska design can have field of view scaling with frequency as @xmath98 .",
    "the choice of these four features will indicate the depth of an eventual survey .",
    "for example a telescope with @xmath84 , @xmath218 and a field of view scaling as @xmath98 can survey 40 @xmath219 in one year . in ten years",
    "the same telescope will be able to survey 150 @xmath219 by probing deeper in redshift .",
    "this same 150 @xmath220 could be completed in just one year if @xmath221 .",
    "we note here the angular resolution required by the baryonic oscillations method is much less than the angular resolution expected of future radio interferometers like the ska .",
    "the results from fig .",
    "9 are independent of the resolution of the instrument because the baryonic ` wiggles ' probe very large angular scales , and confusion will not be a serious issue given the accurate redshifts available for objects in a low - resolution hi survey .",
    "this method will therefore be able to be used whether the instrument being used is an ska - like array or the core of such an array .",
    "now , given that we can have a realistic idea of what type of survey future radio telescopes may produce , we can relate these surveys to an estimated error on the measurement of @xmath8 .",
    "there are are likely to be other efforts in measuring the equation of state of dark energy using the baryonic oscillations method .",
    "as argued in blake & glazebrook ( 2003 ) , an optical survey would , in a one year , be able to measure @xmath8 to @xmath222 , provided a spectrograph that can take data on 3000 galaxies at a time is available on an 8-m optical telescope . in one year",
    ", a dedicated 8-m telescope with such an instrument could cover a cosmic volume of @xmath223 ( a volume 6-times greater than that covered by the sdss survey ) .",
    "this kaos project has been proposed ( barden 2003 ; glazebrook 2003 ) and may produce results in the next decade .    as we can see from eqn.17 , the error on the power spectrum scales as the @xmath224 , and this error would relate to the error on the size scale of the wiggles which would in turn directly relate to an error on the parameter @xmath8 .",
    "we therefore expect the error on @xmath8 to improve as @xmath225 as we cover more volume . at the likely rate of data collection , after a decade of results , the kaos project is likely to produce a constraint roughly a factor @xmath226 better and therefore constrain @xmath8 down to @xmath227 , surveying a volumeof around 60 @xmath219 .    the volume surveyed in a one year survey with a dedicated radio telescope with @xmath228 and @xmath229 and a field of view scaling as @xmath98 is around @xmath230 .",
    "given that it is unlikely that an array such as the future ska will be dedicated to a single project , we conclude that if @xmath231 for the ska we would only be able , on the timescale of years to get constraints of around @xmath227 ( see fig.9 ) , comparable to those from kaos .",
    "we therefore argue that a future radio telescope with a small ( @xmath232 ) @xmath1 could constrain @xmath8 well , but similar constraints will already be available by the time this telescope is operational .",
    "however , a data set with @xmath233 in a hemisphere , which is achievable in one year provided @xmath234 ( see fig.8 ) , would get constraints of @xmath235 given the extra volume available",
    ". we would be able to improve considerably on these constraints in following years of survey by probing deeper in redshift and accruing more volume ( see fig.9 ) .",
    "if we parametrise the equation of state in the form @xmath236 we would have @xmath237 and @xmath238 ( blake et al . 2004 ) . such a data set would be ideal to probe the properties of dark energy and its evolution with redshift",
    "we conclude that for an ska - like telescope , studies of dark energy demand that the optimal telescope has a field of view scaling with frequency @xmath67 as @xmath98 , and an @xmath239 .",
    ".as mentioned in sec . 5.3 , with an ` all hemisphere ' survey covering redshifts 0 to 1.5",
    "we would be able to measure @xmath8 to @xmath240 ; this table illustrates how much longer / shorter it would take if we had chosen a different telescope design , ( rather than a field of view scaling as @xmath98 ) or a different model ( rather than model c ) for the hi mass function . for example",
    ", a telescope with twice the @xmath1 would do the survey @xmath241-times faster , or if the real hi mass function where closer to model a , the survey would take @xmath242-times longer . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]"
