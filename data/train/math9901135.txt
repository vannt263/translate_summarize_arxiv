    "parallelogram polyominoes , sometimes called staircase polyominoes , form a subclass of ( horizontally and vertically ) convex polyominoes on the square lattice , characterized by the fact that they touch the bottom - left and the top - right corners of their minimal bounding rectangle . see figure  [ convparfig ] .",
    "a @xmath2 rotation of these would give a distinct but equivalent class of parallelogram polyominoes .",
    "in the same way as for general convex polyominoes , the area of a parallelogram polyomino is defined as the number of cells that it contains and the half - perimeter is equal to the sum of its width and height .",
    "considerable literature can be found on the enumeration of various classes of polyominoes having some convexity and directedness property , with motivation coming from combinatorics , statistical physics , computer science and recreational mathematics .",
    "see m.  bousquet - mlou @xcite for a recent survey .",
    "in particular , parallelogram polyominoes have been studied with respect to their perimeter and area first by plya , with further contributions yielding refined enumerations from bender , klarner , rivest , delest , fdou , viennot and others .",
    "mireille bousquet - mlou , using the temperley methodology ( @xcite ) , has given a generating function with respect to height , width , area and height of first and last columns ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "polyominoes are usually considered equivalent if they can be obtained from one another by a plane translation .",
    "they are sometimes called translation - type polyominoes to be more precise ( see d.  a.  klarner @xcite ) .",
    "it is natural to consider also _ congruence - type _ polyominoes , that is , equivalence classes of polyominoes under rotations and reflections .",
    "they occur as pieces that can freely move in space , as in plane packing problems ( see s.  w.  golomb @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the enumeration of congruence - type polyominoes , according to area and perimeter , has been carried out in the case of convex polyominoes .",
    "the problem is equivalent to the enumeration of orbits of the dihedral group @xmath0 , of symmetries of the square , acting on convex polyominoes .",
    "the group @xmath0 contains eight elements , usually represented as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath3 denotes the identity element , @xmath4 denotes a rotation by a right angle , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , reflections with respect to the horizontal and vertical axes respectively , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 , reflections about the two diagonal axes of the square ( we take the bissector of the first quadrant for @xmath10 ) .",
    "the number of orbits @xmath11 of any finite group @xmath12 acting on a set @xmath13 is given by the cauchy - frobenius formula ( alias burnside s lemma ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the set of elements of x which are @xmath16-symmetric , that is , invariant under @xmath16 .",
    "hence the enumeration of congruence - type convex polyominoes involves determining the size of the symmetry classes of convex polyominoes for each group element @xmath17 .",
    "formula  ( [ eqnburnside ] ) is valid for infinite sets provided a weighted cardinality @xmath18 is taken , with respect to some @xmath12-invariant weight function @xmath19 . for a class @xmath20 of polyominoes",
    "this means using generating series @xmath21 with respect to half - perimeter and area ( variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) , for example .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to carry out a similar procedure for the class @xmath24 of parallelogram polyominoes .",
    "we observe that a subgroup of @xmath0 acts on parallelogram polyominoes , which we denote @xmath1 , namely @xmath25 , and that congruence types of parallelogram polyominoes coincide with orbits of @xmath24 under @xmath1 . in the following sections we therefore compute the generating series of the symmetry classes @xmath15 of parallelogram polyominoes for all @xmath26 except the identity .",
    "we then use ( [ eqnburnside ] ) to obtain @xmath27 .",
    "it is also possible to count asymmetric parallelogram polyominoes , that is polyominoes that are not @xmath16-invariant for any @xmath16 except the identity , using mbius inversion in the lattice of subgroups of @xmath1 .",
    "this requires also the enumeration of the subclass @xmath28 of @xmath24 , of totally symmetric parallelogram polyominoes .",
    "we carry out this computation and show that asymmetric parallelogram polyominoes are asymptotically equivalent to all parallelogram polyominoes , as expected .",
    "as we will see , the enumeration of all the symmetry classes of parallelogram polyominoes , according to perimeter , involves in one way or the other either the dyck paths ( or dyck words , see j.  labelle @xcite ) , counted by the catalan numbers @xmath29 , or the left factors of dyck paths , counted by the central binomial coefficients @xmath30 ( see cori and viennot @xcite ) , where @xmath31    when the area is taken into account , @xmath23-analogues ( some well - known and some novel ) of these numbers appear naturally .",
    "we would like to thank x.  g.  viennot and m.  bousquet - mlou for useful discussions .",
    "it has been known for a long time ( levine @xcite , plya @xcite ) that the number of parallelogram polyominoes of perimeter @xmath32 is given by the catalan number @xmath33 .",
    "one proof of this fact is provided by the following bijection , due to delest and viennot ( @xcite ) between parallelogram polyominoes of perimeter @xmath34 and dyck paths of length @xmath32 : given a parallelogram polyomino @xmath35 of perimeter @xmath34 , let @xmath36 be the sequence of column heights of @xmath35 , and @xmath37 be such that @xmath38 is the number of cells of contact between columns @xmath39 and @xmath40 of @xmath35 .",
    "the associated dyck path @xmath41 is the unique dyck path with @xmath42 peaks and @xmath43 valleys such that the peak heights are given in order by the sequence @xmath36 , and the valley heights by the sequence @xmath44 ( the horizontal axis is at level @xmath45 ) .",
    "the height of @xmath35 is @xmath46 , which is also given by @xmath47 on the other hand , the number of @xmath48 steps in @xmath41 , that is the half - length of the path , is given by @xmath49 which is seen to be @xmath50 by the previous equation . hence @xmath41 is a dyck path of length @xmath32 .",
    "also , note that the sum of the heights of the peaks , @xmath51 is simply the area of @xmath35 .",
    "figure  [ dyckparbij1fig ] illustrates the bijection .",
    "it follows that the generating series @xmath52 for parallelogram polyominoes according to half - perimeter is @xmath53    it has also been known for some time that when the area is taken into account , the generating series involves a quotient of @xmath23-analogues of bessel functions ( see klarner and rivest @xcite and bender @xcite ) .",
    "plya ( @xcite and @xcite ) found a laurent series relating the area and perimeter generating function to a specialization of itself , from which the terms of the series can be extracted easily .",
    "the width , height and area generating series can also be expressed as a continued fraction ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we will use the following recent more general form due to m.  bousquet - mlou  @xcite , giving the generating series @xmath54 of parallelogram polyominoes , where the variables @xmath8 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath23 mark respectively the height of the rightmost column , the width , the overall height , and the area .",
    "( @xcite ) the generating function @xmath54 of parallelogram polyominoes is given by @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 with the usual notation @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61    note that the half - perimeter and area generating function @xmath62 of parallelogram polyominoes is obtained by putting @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 in ( [ eqnmbmpar ] ) .",
    "observe that if we apply the delest - viennot bijection to an @xmath5-symmetric parallelogram polyomino of perimeter @xmath66 , the dyck path we obtain is vertically symmetric ( or , equivalently , the dyck word associated to it is a palindrome ) .",
    "hence we need only consider half the path , which is simply a left factor , of length @xmath42 , of a dyck path .",
    "the number of @xmath5-symmetric parallelogram polyominoes of half - perimeter @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 \\frac{1}{2}{\\left({{k+1 } \\atop { ( k+1)/2}}\\right ) } & \\textrm{if $ k$ is odd}\\ , .",

    "we    prove  ( [ eqn : r2symnum ] ) using generating functions .",
    "dyck paths and left    factors of dyck paths are generated by the algebraic grammar    @xmath70 over the alphabet    @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72 denotes the dyck paths    and @xmath73 the left factors , while @xmath55 and    @xmath74 respectively denote a @xmath75    step and a @xmath48 step .",
    "the first production rule    gives @xmath76 , which    we solve for    @xmath77    +    the second production rule gives    @xmath78 , which we can solve , now that we have    @xmath79 , for    @xmath80    +    substituting @xmath81 into    @xmath82 gives the generating series    @xmath83 of left factors of dyck paths by their length :    @xmath84 from    which  ( [ eqn : r2symnum ] ) follows .",
    "@xmath61    in order to include the area , we could extend another bijection , due to bousquet - mlou and viennot @xcite , involving heaps of segments , to left factors of dyck paths .",
    "however , there is a more direct approach .",
    "indeed , parallelogram polyominoes with rotational symmetry can be obtained from two copies of a same parallelogram polyomino glued together .",
    "the glueing process depends on whether we want the final object to be of even width or of odd width , as can be seen in figure  [ r2symfig ] . if @xmath85 is the generating function of @xmath5-symmetric parallelogram polyominoes , then @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are respectively the generating series of even - width and odd - width @xmath5-symmetric parallelogram polyominoes .",
    "proof : :       +    let @xmath35 be an @xmath5-symmetric parallelogram of    even width .",
    "we define the fundamental region of @xmath35 to be    the left half of @xmath35 .",
    "call this polyomino @xmath90    ( see figure  [ r2symfig](a ) ) .",
    "we first remark that @xmath90 is a    parallelogram polyomino . to get @xmath35 from @xmath90",
    ",    we rotate a copy of @xmath90 by @xmath91 and    glue the result @xmath92 to @xmath90 along    the rightmost column",
    ". if this column has length equal to    @xmath42 , there will be @xmath42 possible positions for    @xmath92 relative to @xmath90 .",
    "the    substitution @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and    @xmath96 in the generating series    @xmath97 of directed convex polyominoes corresponds    to the highest position of @xmath92 , which minimizes    the overall height of @xmath35 .",
    "all the possible positions will    be accounted for by multiplying by    @xmath98 . in other words ,",
    "the substitution    to make in @xmath99 is    @xmath100    +    summing over all possible @xmath42 s , we find the proposed    generating series  ( [ eqn : r2sym ] ) for @xmath5-symmetric    parallelograms .",
    "@xmath61      proof : :    the proof is similar to the previous one .",
    "the main difference is    that only one glueing position of @xmath92 to    @xmath90 is admissible and that furthermore the rightmost    column of @xmath90 and its rotated image in    @xmath92 are superimposed to yield an odd width ( see    figure  [ r2symfig](b ) ) .",
    "details are left to the reader .",
    "@xmath61      the above expressions for the generating series of @xmath5-symmetric parallelogram polyominoes can be used to extract the polynomials @xmath103 from it ( i.e. develop it in powers of @xmath22 after substituting @xmath104 in it ) . here",
    "are the first few of these polynomials : @xmath105      we begin by introducing a subfamily of parallelogram polyominoes which we will call _ dyck polyominoes _ as they correspond to dyck paths drawn over and above the main diagonal .",
    "we will also consider truncated dyck polyominoes , which we will call _ left factors of dyck polyominoes _ ( or @xmath106 polyominoes for short ) , again in analogy with the left factors of dyck paths .",
    "dyck and @xmath106 polyominoes are illustrated in figure  [ dyckpolyofig ] .",
    "we introduce @xmath107 the generating function for @xmath106 polyominoes having a basis of width @xmath50 , with variables @xmath108 , @xmath56 and @xmath23 corresponding to the number of cells of the uppermost row , the height and the area respectively .",
    "@xmath109 can be defined recursively by the following functional equation , illustrated in figure  [ lfdconstructfig ] : @xmath110          a straightforward application of lemma 2.3 from @xcite ( m. bousquet - mlou ) gives the solution to the functional equation  ( [ eqnlfd ] ) .",
    "as we do not need the variable @xmath108 for our purpose , we set it equal to @xmath3 , which simplifies the expression for the generating function .      for @xmath117 , this gives @xmath118 for the height and area generating function for dyck polyominoes .",
    "however , we can also express @xmath119 using the classical @xmath23-analogue of catalan numbers @xmath120 , satisfying the recurrence @xmath121 as it is well known that they area - enumerate dyck paths of length @xmath32 .",
    "the area enumerated by @xmath120 is the number of cells under the path and strictly above its supporting diagonal ( i.e. the cells on the diagonal are not included in the area ) . to get a dyck polyomino from a dyck path",
    ", we have to add the area of the diagonal .",
    "if the length of the path is @xmath32 , then a factor of @xmath122 has to be added .",
    "a further diagonal of cells has to be added because the dyck paths can touch the supporting diagonal , in which case they are not polyominoes . for the paths of length @xmath32",
    ", @xmath123 cells thus have to be added , contributing a further @xmath124 factor to the area .",
    "this last diagonal also adds one unit of height to the polyominoes .",
    "hence @xmath125      there is a nice area - preserving bijection between @xmath9-symmetric parallelograms of a given half - perimeter and @xmath5-symmetric parallelograms with same half - perimeter .",
    "since the minimal rectangle of a @xmath9-symmetric parallelogram is necessarily a square , the perimeter is a multiple of @xmath126 , and thus the half - perimeter is even .",
    "hence we have @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the generating series of @xmath9-symmetric parallelogram polyominoes and the @xmath129 are defined by  ( [ eqnr2kq ] ) .",
    "the bijection is shown on an example in figure  [ r2d2bijfig ] , and goes as follows : a @xmath5-symmetric parallelogram has a center of rotation .",
    "if it has even half - perimeter , this center will either fall in the center of a cell ( if both the height and the width are odd ) or be the common corner of four cells forming a square ( if both the height and the width are even ) . in both cases , we consider the first diagonal ( parallel to the bissector of the second quadrant ) passing through the center of rotation and the region of the parallelogram below the second diagonal ( see figure  [ r2d2bijfig ] ) .",
    "this region is not a polyomino , but the parallelogram is obtained by glueing the region and a copy of it rotated by @xmath91 in the unique way such that there are no `` half - cells '' left .",
    "suppose that instead of rotating the copy of the region , we reflect it along the second diagonal and glue it so that there are no half - cells left , then we clearly obtain a @xmath9-symmetric parallelogram which , further , has the exact same perimeter and area as the initial @xmath5-symmetric parallelogram .",
    "we can similarly reverse the process to start with an arbitrary @xmath9-symmetric parallelogram and end with a @xmath5-symmetric parallelogram .",
    "we next consider @xmath10-symmetric parallelogram polyominoes , i.e. parallelograms which are left invariant by a symmetry along the second diagonal .",
    "figure  [ d1symfig ] gives an example of such a parallelogram .",
    "we observe first that the minimal rectangle of such a parallelogram will always be a square with side length equal to the quarter - perimeter of the inscribed parallelogram .",
    "we note that @xmath10-symmetric parallelogram polyominoes can be constructed from two copies of a same dyck polyomino , whose diagonals we glue together ( dark cells on figure  [ d1symfig ] )",
    ". the area of the final object will be twice the area of the dyck polyomino minus the area of diagonal , which was counted twice .",
    "there are as many cells on the diagonal as the height of the dyck polyomino , and the width of the final object will also be the height of the dyck polyomino .",
    "hence we get        the final ( non - cyclic ) subgroup whose set of fixed elements we study is the whole group itself .",
    "this group is generated by any two nontrivial elements , but it is convenient to consider the symmetries along the two diagonals as the generators .",
    "this allows us to characterize the fundamental region of a @xmath1-symmetric parallelogram , as can be seen in figure  [ r2d1d2symfig ] .",
    "we note first that the minimal rectangle of a @xmath1-symmetric parallelogram @xmath35 is a square .",
    "we remark also that the exterior path going from @xmath132 to @xmath133 is a dyck path that has the additional property that it is symmetric with respect to the second diagonal passing through the center of @xmath35 ( i.e. the dyck word in @xmath55 and @xmath74 associated to the dyck path is a palindrome ) . hence @xmath35 is completely determined by `` half '' a dyck path ( the path going from @xmath132 to @xmath134 ) .",
    "if @xmath35 has half - perimeter @xmath135 ( its half - perimeter is necessarily even since the minimal rectangle is a square ) , then the path @xmath136 is a symmetrical dyck path of length @xmath137 , and the path @xmath138 is simply a left factor of length @xmath43 of a dyck path .",
    "thus we have the following result :    the number of @xmath1-symmetric parallelogram polyominoes of half - perimeter @xmath66 is given by @xmath139   \\frac{1}{2}{\\left({{k+1 } \\atop { ( k+1)/2}}\\right ) } & \\textrm{if $ k$ is odd}\\ , .",
    "\\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ]        we obtain the area and half - perimeter generating function for the @xmath1-symmetric parallelogram polyominoes by constructing these from 4 copies of a @xmath106 polyomino , as illustrated in figure  [ d1d2constructfig ] .",
    "some cells are superposed ( the dark ones ) and others have to be added ( square of white cells in the center ) , and that has to be taken into account when computing the area of the final object .",
    "if the @xmath106 polyomino has area @xmath140 , height ( number of cells on the diagonal ) @xmath141 and base @xmath50 , then we have that the area of the @xmath1-symmetric parallelogram polyomino is @xmath142 , while its half - perimeter will be given by @xmath143 .",
    "hence we have the following proposition :    the half - perimeter and area generating function @xmath144 for @xmath1-symmetric parallelogram polyominoes is given by @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the generating series for @xmath106 polyominoes with a base of width @xmath50.@xmath61            we are now in a position to enumerate congruence - type parallelogram polyominoes , i.e. parallelograms up to rotation and reflection using formula  ( [ eqnburnside ] ) with @xmath149 and @xmath150 , the class of all parallelogram polyominoes : @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the half - perimeter and area generating series of the convex @xmath16-symmetric polyominoes .",
    "therefore ,            the reader is refered to @xcite for a general discussion of mbius inversion , and to @xcite to see it applied to the enumeration of the symmetry classes of convex polyominoes .",
    "we simply give here in figure  [ mobiusparfig ] the lattice of the subgroups of @xmath1 and the value of the mbius function on the points of the lattice .",
    "for subgroups @xmath156 of @xmath1 , we denote by @xmath157 ( resp .",
    "@xmath158 ) the half - perimeter and area generating series for the set of parallelogram polyominoes having at least ( resp .",
    "exactly ) the symmetries of @xmath156 .",
    "the half - perimeter and area generating series @xmath160 of asymmetric parallelogram polyominoes is given by @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the generating series of @xmath1-symmetric polyominoes .",
    "@xmath61          here",
    "we show the asymptotic result that for large area or large perimeter , almost all parallelogram polyominoes are asymmetric .",
    "in other words , the probability for a parallelogram polyomino to have at least one symmetry goes to zero as the area or the perimeter goes to infinity .",
    "let @xmath156 be any non - trivial subgroup of @xmath1 and denote by @xmath169 ( resp .",
    "@xmath170 ) the number of @xmath156-symmetric parallelogram polyominoes with area ( resp .",
    "half - perimeter ) @xmath50 .",
    "then , @xmath171    proof : :       +    the proof for the perimeter part of the proposition is immediate as we    have closed forms for all the coefficients , and thus the limit can be    verified to be zero explicitly .",
    "+    for the area , we need only consider @xmath5- and    @xmath10-symmetric parallelogram polyominoes , as the    @xmath9-symmetric parallelograms are in bijection with a    subclass of @xmath5-symmetric ones , and the    @xmath1-symmetric parallelograms are a subclass    of all the other classes of symmetry .",
    "a same basic argument works for    @xmath5- and @xmath10-symmetric parallelogram    polyominoes , using the fact that they are constructed from two    congruent subpolyominoes .",
    "a supplementary column sometimes has to be    added in the @xmath5 case , according to whether the height    or the width of the initial parallelogram is odd or even .",
    "these    subpolyominoes are parallelograms in every case , and they have at most    half the area of the initial object .    +    *",
    "* @xmath5-symmetric parallelogram polyominoes : *  an    @xmath5-symmetric parallelogram polyomino with even width    and area @xmath50 is constructed from two congruent    subparallelograms with exactly half the area , which can be glued    together in at most @xmath172 ways ( the maximal height of the    columns that get glued together ) .",
    "so    @xmath173 .",
    "hence    @xmath174    +    next consider an @xmath5-symmetric parallelogram polyomino    with odd width and area @xmath50 .",
    "this polyomino is constructed    from a central column ( @xmath50 choices of height ) and two    congruent subparallelograms of area at most    @xmath175 .",
    "then there are at most    @xmath50 possible positions where to glue the subparallelograms    to the central column ( they are glued symmetrically ) .",
    "thus    @xmath176 and the result follows as above .",
    "hence the result    holds for the subgroup @xmath177 of    @xmath1 ;    * * @xmath10-symmetric convex polyominoes : *  let    @xmath35 be a @xmath10-symmetric parallelogram    polyomino and @xmath90 its fundamental region .",
    "suppose that    @xmath35 has @xmath178 cells on the diagonal symmetry    axis .",
    "then the minimum area @xmath35 can have is    @xmath179 .",
    "this gives a minimum area of    @xmath180 for @xmath90 .",
    "hence    @xmath181    +    then if we add to @xmath90 a cell not on the diagonal symmetry    axis , two cells get added to @xmath35 , and thus we conclude    that the ratio can only decrease as we make @xmath35 into a    larger @xmath10-symmetric parallelogram polyomino with the    same number of cells on the diagonal axis . for @xmath182 ,    the ratio will be smaller than or equal to @xmath183 . as a    loose approximation , we can take @xmath90 to be any    parallelogram polyomino .",
    "this gives    @xmath184 .",
