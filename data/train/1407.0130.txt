    "last year , higgs particle is discovered  @xcite and all particles in the standard model of particle physics are eventually identified .",
    "however , many phenomena which can not be explained within the standard model have been found ( e.g. dark matter , inflation , neutrino mass , etc ) .",
    "a number of hypothetical particles are introduced and supposed to be observed in the future . since those beyond standard model ( bsm ) particles are assumed to be very heavy and/or weakly coupling to the standard model particles , to detect them is not a easy task .",
    "in fact , no evidence of a bsm particle is found in large hadron collider , so far .",
    "therefore it is very important to consider a novel technique to probe bsm particles .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new way to scan the mass spectrum of the bsm particles by using gravitational waves ( gws ) which are radiated by light black holes ( bhs ) .",
    "it is well known that light bhs lose their masses by emitting particles through hawking radiation and finally evaporate  @xcite .",
    "a bh emits only particles whose mass are smaller than hawking temperature @xmath0 , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the reduced planck mass and @xmath3 is the mass of the bh .",
    "@xmath0 increases as the bh loses its mass .",
    "thus the bh begins to radiate a heavy particle with a mass @xmath4 when the hawking temperature reaches the mass , @xmath5 .",
    "since hawking temperature goes up to the planck scale right before the evaporation of a bh , any particles whose masses are less than @xmath2 can be radiated by evaporating bhs .",
    "the mass spectrum of bsm particles is imprinted in the power spectrum of gws from evaporating bhs . roughly speaking ,",
    "this is because when a bh begins to emit a heavy particle , the number of degrees of freedom ( dof ) radiated by the bh changes and the ratio between the energy going to gws and the total radiative energy also changes .",
    "this drop of the energy fraction causes a step like feature in the gw spectrum . in eq .",
    ", the relationship between the bsm mass spectrum and the resultant gw spectrum is sketched , @xmath6 the bsm mass spectrum , @xmath7 , determines the dof emitted by bhs as a function of hawking temperature , @xmath8",
    ". the mass loss rate of a bh is proportional to it , @xmath9 , and we can solve the time evolution of the bh mass , @xmath10 or equivalently , that of the hawking temperature @xmath11 . then it is workable to compute the resultant spectrum of the gws , @xmath12 , or any other particles .",
    "note that the spectrum of photons or neutrinos can also be candidates for observational probe but we focus on the graviton case in this paper , because the interaction with other particles is negligible .",
    "the imprinted feature of the bsm physics in the gw spectrum appears at the frequency which corresponds to the energy scale of the bsm .",
    "such a high frequency gw is perhaps undetectable .",
    "however , if one identifies the bhs as primordial black holes ( pbhs )  @xcite which evaporate in the very early universe , the emitted gws are substantially redshifted and become accessible .    to obtain a proper spectrum form ,",
    "we take into account the greybody factor which is often ignored but significantly alters the spectrum .",
    "moreover , since we do not know the actual bsm theory , we assume that all the bsm particles live at the gut scale to demonstrate a readable spectrum .",
    "the rest of paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly review hawking radiation and greybody factor . in section 3 , the spectrum of gws emitted by a bh without cosmic expansion is calculated . in section 4 ,",
    "the spectrum of gws produced by pbhs is computed and its observability is discussed . in section 5 ,",
    "we conclude .",
    "in this section , let us briefly review hawking radiation and the greybody factor of gravitons .",
    "the energy spectrum of a graviton emitted by the hawking radiation of a single bh per unit time is given by  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the energy of the graviton , @xmath15 denotes the greybody factor ( or the absorption coefficient ) and the factor 2 in front of @xmath15 reflects the two polarization of graviton . on the black hole event horizon , particles are radiated with the thermal distribution ( blackbody ) while not all of them reach a distant observer because of the gravitational potential of the bh .",
    "the greybody factor , @xmath15 , represent the probability that a particle with an energy @xmath14 travels to the infinite distance despite of the bh potential .",
    "the greybody factor is obtained by solving the equation of motion around the bh of the particle in interest . in the case of tensor perturbation around a schwarzschild bh",
    ", it is written as  @xcite @xmath16q_l(r)=0 , \\label{rw eq}\\\\   v(r , l)= \\frac{r-1}{r}\\left [ \\frac{l(l+1)}{r^2}-\\frac{3}{r^3}\\right]=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the radial coordinate and @xmath18 is tortoise coordinate , @xmath19 .",
    "note that in this section , we set schwarzschild radius as 1 , @xmath20 eq .",
    "is called  regge - wheeler equation \" .",
    "one can check the definition of @xmath21 in their paper  @xcite , but it is basically the @xmath22-mode of the graviton field whose polarization is odd .",
    "the even mode has more complicated potential while its greybody factor is identical to the odd mode  @xcite .",
    "note that the label of the spherical harmonics should be @xmath23 in the graviton case .",
    "since the potential @xmath24 vanish at @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the asymptotic solution of @xmath27 is given by plane waves @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the reflection , transmission coefficients , respectively .",
    "has the same form as the schrdinger equation and hence we can use the analogy with the tunneling problem in quantum mechanics",
    ". then the greybody factor of graviton is given by @xmath31 the analytic expressions of @xmath32 in the low energy limit @xmath33 and the greybody factor in the high energy limit @xmath34 are known , @xmath35 ^ 2 , \\label{low energy behabior } \\\\ & \\gamma(\\omega ) \\xrightarrow{\\omega\\gg1 } \\frac{27}{4}\\omega^2 .",
    "\\label{high energy behabior}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for general @xmath14 , however , @xmath30 can not be solved analytically and a numerical calculation is needed .",
    "we numerically obtain @xmath36 and plot it in fig .",
    "[ gbf fig ] .",
    "our result is consistent with previous works  @xcite .",
    "therefore by integrating eq .   with respect to time @xmath37 , the gw spectrum produced by a single bh can be obtained .",
    "( eq .  [ low energy behabior ] ) and @xmath34 ( eq .  [ high energy behabior ] ) , respectively.,width=283 ]    before finishing this section , let us mention the effective dof emitted by a bh . if one ignores greybody factor and consider a bh as a black - body radiator , the stefan - boltzmann law yields @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the area of the bh and @xmath40 denotes the number of emitted dof .",
    "comparing eqs .   and , anantua et al .",
    "@xcite have introduced the following effective dof @xmath41 including the effect of greybody factors : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the spin of the particle in interest .",
    "the values of @xmath41 are given by  @xcite @xmath44 where ",
    "( un)charged \" denotes the electric charge of the emitted spinor .",
    "one obtains the total dof in the standard model as  @xcite @xmath45 therefore after all the standard model particles are begun to radiate , less than @xmath46 of the total emitted energy is radiated as gravitons .",
    "note that this result is different by a order of magnitude from the naive estimation by the effective dof in thermal equilibrium , @xmath47 .",
    "in this section , we calculate the gw spectrum produced by a single bh without cosmic expansion . for simplicity , we consider that the total effective dof changes instantly and only once at a bsm mass scale , @xmath48 then solving the evolution equation of a bh mass , @xmath49 one can obtain the time evolution of @xmath0 as  @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the initial hawking temperature , @xmath52 is the lifetime of the bh if @xmath53 regardless of @xmath0 , @xmath54 is the time when @xmath55 changes , @xmath56 is the lifetime after @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the total lifetime of the bh .    substituting eq .   into eq .",
    ", we obtain the time derivative of the graviton spectrum , @xmath59 , as a function of time . nonetheless , it is important to notice that if the bsm scale @xmath4 is much higher than the experimentally accessible scale , we can not resolve the time variability of @xmath59 .",
    "for example , provided @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the bh lifetime is @xmath62sec .",
    "therefore , in practice , the bh evaporates instantaneously and the observed spectrum is the time integral of eq .  .",
    "then we find @xmath63 , \\label{x form}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we define @xmath64 .",
    "the integrand in eq .   has a peak at @xmath65 since the greybody factor @xmath66 is suppressed for @xmath67 ( see fig .",
    "[ gbf fig ] ) .",
    "therefore gravitons with energy @xmath14 are mostly emitted when @xmath68 .",
    "this gw spectrum is numerically evaluated and plotted in fig .",
    "[ dedw fig ] .",
    "( gut scale ) , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the step like feature appears at @xmath71 and the amplitude drops there by the factor of @xmath72 .",
    "the red , cyan and green dashed lines represent the asymptotic behaviors given by eqs .   and .,width=283 ]",
    "let us derive asymptotic expressions of eq .  .",
    "for @xmath73 , the first line in eq .   has the main contribution .",
    "using eq .   with @xmath74 , namely @xmath75 , and the taylor expansion in the denominator , one can show @xmath76 on the other hand , for @xmath77 , @xmath14 is greater than @xmath11 at the beginning while @xmath11 finally becomes much larger than @xmath14 .",
    "thus the integration interval can be approximated by @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "the numerical evaluation yields @xmath79 and one finds @xmath80 where @xmath81 is @xmath82 for @xmath83 and @xmath84 for @xmath85 .",
    "these approximated spectra , which are plotted in fig .",
    "[ dedw fig ] as dashed lines , clearly explain that the step like feature appears at @xmath86 and the amplitude drops there by the factor of @xmath72 .",
    "the reason of the drop of the amplitude can be understood that the energy ratio going to gravitons decreases as the total dof of the hawking radiation increases .",
    "the gw spectrum , fig .  [ dedw fig ] , can be realized if a single bh evaporates in our neighborhood in which the cosmic expansion is negligible .",
    "although @xmath87 should be taken much lower in that case , it does not affect the step like feature .",
    "thus if we could observe such spectrum , it is possible to know the mass scale and the dof , namely the mass spectrum , of bsm particles .",
    "unfortunately , however , it is difficult to observe the step in this case because its frequency is around @xmath4 and is probably too high to be detected even in the future .    in the next section ,",
    "we consider primordial black holes ( pbhs ) which evaporate in very early universe .",
    "the frequency of a graviton which was emitted by a pbh gets substantially redshifted before coming to the earth and hence its frequency can be low enough to be observed .",
    "in this section , we calculate the gw spectrum produced by pbhs . the gw spectrum from pbhs has been computed in previous works  @xcite but neither the greybody factor nor the change of the dof are taken into account ( however the latter is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the case of pbhs",
    ", two additional effect should be considered ; cosmic expansion and the number density of pbhs .",
    "pbhs are formed at @xmath88 where the initial mass of a pbh is given by @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "provided that pbhs are formed at the radiation dominant era , the pbh energy fraction increases , @xmath91 .",
    "therefore if the initial energy fraction , @xmath92 , is large enough , @xmath93 , pbhs dominate the universe before their evaporation at @xmath94 . in that case , from the onset of the pbh domination until the evaporation , the universe is in matter dominant era and the total energy density at the evaporation is given by @xmath95 ignoring the change of the dof in the thermal bath , one finds the scale factor at the evaporation is @xmath96 where the subscript ",
    "eq \" denotes the time of matter - radiation equality and @xmath97 is the energy density at present . using the scaling , @xmath98 during radiation dominant era and @xmath99 during matter dominant era",
    ", one can obtain the scale factor @xmath100 from the pbh formation until the evaporation .",
    "remembering @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the comoving frequency , we find that @xmath103 of the hawking radiated gravitons at present is written by @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the pbh number density with the initial value , @xmath106 .",
    "we numerically evaluate this equation and plot it in fig .",
    "[ pbhgw fig ] .     produced by evaporating pbhs ( see eq .  ) .",
    "the parameters are same as fig .",
    "[ dedw fig ] with @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the step like feature appears at @xmath109hz and the amplitude drops there by the factor of @xmath72 .",
    "the cutoff at @xmath110hz is introduced by hand because the contribution from @xmath111 is not reliable .",
    "the red dashed line show the case without the cutoff .",
    "the colorful dotted lines represent approximated spectra derived in appendix and confirm the validity of the numerical calculation.,width=283 ]    again one can see the step like feature in the gw spectrum . furthermore , in the case of fig",
    ".  [ pbhgw fig ] , the frequency of the step is redshifted by the factor of @xmath112 , and given by @xmath113 thus the frequency of the step is now accessible ( remember @xmath114hz is the frequency of visible light ) .",
    "in fact , the gw detector built by the group in university of birmingham has sensitivity at @xmath115hz  @xcite .",
    "although the sensitivity is not enough at present , it is expected to increase significantly in the future  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the step frequency @xmath116 depend on the initial mass of the pbhs .",
    "here we consider that the pbhs are formed right after inflation due to the preheating  @xcite while pbhs can be formed by many other processes  @xcite",
    ". then @xmath117 is obtained from the hubble parameter right after inflation , @xmath118gev , which is favored based on the bicep2 result  @xcite .    the hawking radiation , eq .",
    ", is derived based on the quasi - classical treatment and is no longer reliable for @xmath119 .",
    "therefore we introduce the cutoff in the integral range of eq . by replacing @xmath120 by @xmath121 at which the hawking temperature reaches @xmath2 . because of this artificial cutoff",
    ", @xmath12 in fig.[pbhgw fig ] rapidly falls at @xmath122hz while the red dashed line shows the case without the cutoff .",
    "in this paper , we demonstrate that if the dof of hawking radiation increases at a bsm scale , a step like feature is imprinted in the gw spectrum produced by evaporating bhs . since the step height and the frequency of the feature indicate the number of additional dof and the energy scale of bsm particles , respectively , we can scan the mass spectrum of the actual bsm theory by observing the gw spectrum .",
    "we assume that all bsm particles live at @xmath123 for simplicity , set the initial mass of the pbh as @xmath124 inspired by the bicep2 result , and calculate the gw spectrum from the pbhs ( see fig .",
    "[ pbhgw fig ] ) . it is found that the frequency of the spectrum feature is substantially redshifted due to cosmic expansion and enters the observable range .    in reality",
    ", the bsm mass spectrum may be distributed over many different energy scales . in that case , a lot of steps appear in the gw spectrum while our methodology is still useful . note that bhs can radiate even  dark particles \" which couple to the standard model sector very weakly .",
    "therefore our technique is sensitive to these dark particles and can be complementary to particle accelerators or direct detection experiments .",
