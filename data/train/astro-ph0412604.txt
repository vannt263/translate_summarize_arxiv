    "are there dark halos in the universe , i.e.  dark - matter halos of substantial mass which for some reason fail to produce light",
    "? this question has recently attracted attention by the detection of significant and apparently massive peaks in weak - lensing surveys which are not seen to correspond to galaxy groups or clusters in the optical or x - ray bands ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "dark - matter halos are embedded into large - scale structure .",
    "measuring the inhomogeneities of projected mass distributions , lensing observations of halos are overlaid by the lensing signal of the large - scale structure in front of and behind the halos .",
    "being approximately a gaussian random field , lensing by large - scale structure adds peaks and troughs to the signal which can be mistaken for halos .",
    "it may thus be that part of the claimed dark - halo detections are in fact peaks in the random weak gravitational lensing signal of the large - scale structure .",
    "is there a way to separate the two types of lensing signal , and thus to improve the reliability of weak - lensing halo detections ?",
    "the principal difficulty in doing so is the unsharp boundary between halos and the large - scale structure .",
    "nonetheless , we shall describe below the construction of a linear matched filter which attempts to suppress the weak - lensing signal from large - scale structures and yet leaves the signal from sufficiently massive halos for detection .",
    "filtering in fourier space is a flexible and powerful tool which has many applications for galaxy cluster lensing , like the lensing on the cosmic microwave background radiation , where there is a strong superimposition of different noise contributions ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) , and lensing on background sources .",
    "it could also be used for lensing on background galaxies .",
    "our strategy is as follows .",
    "the large - scale structure can be considered as composed of dark - matter halos of a broad and continuous mass range . yet",
    ", there is a characteristic length scale at each cosmological epoch , the nonlinear scale , at which the variance of the dark - matter density contrast becomes unity .",
    "this length scale se parates the small - scale regime where the dark - matter power spectrum is dominated by the contributions of presumably virialised halos from the large - scale regime on which the dark - matter density can be considered as a linear superposition of linearly evolved perturbation modes . in view of weak lensing",
    ", this suggests the operational definition of large - scale structure lensing which is contributed by the linearly evolved matter distribution beyond the non - linear scale , and halo lensing , which is contributed by non - linear , gravitationally bound , virialised structures .",
    "we are aware that this operational definition may be questionable for many applications of weak gravitational lensing .",
    "for instance , it is well known that it is mainly the non - linear part of the dark - matter power spectrum which has now been measured with spectacular success in the weak - lensing surveys of many groups .",
    "yet , we aim at a substantial more modest goal here . being confronted with peak detections in weak - lensing data , we wish to know which of them can be attributed to halos , and which of them are likely caused by the large - scale structure .    in this attempt , we adopt the operational definition of the distinction between large - scale structure and halo lensing , construct a linear matched filter for halo lensing and model the lensing signal by intervening large - scale structures as a noise component influencing the shape of the matched filter .",
    "matched filters for extracting sources of interest embedded into substantial background noise were previously proposed for many kind of observations , ranging from the analysis of cosmic microwave background maps @xcite to weak lensing tomography @xcite .    in sect .",
    "2 , we briefly review those aspects of gravitational lensing which are needed for the rest of the paper .",
    "we describe the filter construction in sect .  3 and contrast it with the more conventional aperture mass in sect .  4 .",
    "simulations described in sect .  5 are used in sect .  6 to show that our suggested filter yields promising results .",
    "we summarise and conclude in sect .",
    "we briefly review in this section those gravitational - lensing concepts which we shall use later . for a more detailed discussion ,",
    "we refer the reader to the review by @xcite .",
    "we start with an isolated lens whose surface - mass density is @xmath0 at the angular position @xmath1 on the sky .",
    "its lensing potential is @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the usual angular - diameter distances between the observer and the lens , the observer and the source , and the lens and the source , respectively .",
    "the reduced deflection angle experienced by a light ray crossing the lens plane at @xmath1 is the gradient of the potential , @xmath4 the image positions @xmath1 for a source located at @xmath5 are given by the lens equation @xmath6    for sources much smaller than typical scales on which the lens properties vary , the lens mapping can be linearised .",
    "the deformation of images with respect to the source is then given by the jacobian matrix @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the convergence @xmath9 i.e.  the surface - mass density scaled by its critical value @xmath10 the distortion is described by the two components of the shear , @xmath11 which are combined into the complex shear @xmath12 .",
    "we further use the common abbreviation @xmath13    outside critical curves , image ellipticities are determined by the complex reduced shear @xmath14 in the weak - lensing limit , @xmath15 , and the reduced shear approximates the shear , @xmath16 , to first order .",
    "source and image shapes are quantified by the complex ellipticity @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the semi - major and semi - minor axes of an ellipse fitting the object s surface - brightness distribution .",
    "the position angle of the major axis of the ellipse is @xmath20 .",
    "the expectation value of the intrinsic source ellipticity @xmath21 is assumed to vanish .",
    "a sufficiently small source with ellipticity @xmath21 is imaged to have an ellipticity @xmath22 where the asterisk denotes complex conjugation .",
    "this equation illustrates that the lensing distortion is determined by the reduced shear , which is the only lensing quantity directly accessible through measurements of galaxy ellipticities alone .",
    "we wish to construct a filter allowing the weak - lensing signal of halos to be extracted from weak - lensing observations of wide fields .",
    "we want the filter to suppress , as well as possible , the weak - lensing signal of the large - scale structure which can otherwise be mistaken as lensing by halos .",
    "as described in the introduction , we are well aware that this separation can not fully succeed because of the unsharp boundary between lensing by large - scale structure and dark - matter halos . according to the operational definition of large - scale structure",
    "lensing given there , we shall model the weak lensing by linearly evolved structures as a noise component to be filtered out .    consider the weak gravitational lensing signal of a dark - matter halo with amplitude @xmath23 and angular shape @xmath24 .",
    "the measured signal @xmath25 is contaminated by some noise @xmath26 , @xmath27 whose components are to be specified below .    in our application , the observed signal is provided by the measured ellipticities of the background galaxies , which are weakly distorted by the foreground halo and the intervening large - scale structure .",
    "the expectation value of the image ellipticities at a given position on the sky is the reduced shear , @xmath28    there are several noise contributions .",
    "first , the gravitational shear is being measured at the random positions of the background galaxies .",
    "this adds shot noise proportional to the number density of the galaxies .",
    "second , these galaxies are intrinsically elliptical , thus the determination of a single galaxy ellipticity is a very noisy measurement of the shear only .",
    "this adds a noise component proportional to the variance of the intrinsic galaxy ellipticity .",
    "finally , there is the noise component which we are primarily aiming at , which is caused by weak lensing of intervening large - scale structures .",
    "this third source of noise will be modelled by the linear dark - matter power spectrum , according to our operational separation between halo and large - scale structure lensing .",
    "these noise components are assumed to be random with zero mean and isotropic such that their statistical properties are independent of the position on the sky .",
    "these assumptions are well justified , since in first approximation the background galaxies are randomly positioned and oriented , and weak lensing by the large - scale structures is well described by an isotropic gaussian random field .",
    "the variances of the noise components are conveniently described in the fourier domain , where their correlation functions are @xmath29 the hats above symbols denote the fourier transforms .",
    "we wish to construct a linear filter @xmath30 which , when convolved with the signal , will yield an estimate @xmath31 for the amplitude @xmath23 at the position @xmath1 , @xmath32    we further want the filter to satisfy two constraints .",
    "first , we require it to be unbiased , i.e.  the average error , @xmath33\\ ] ] has to vanish .",
    "second , the measurement _ noise _ @xmath34 , determined by the mean - squared deviation of the estimate from its true value , @xmath35 has to be minimal .    for finding a filter @xmath36 satisfying these two conditions",
    ", we combine them by means of a lagrangian multiplier @xmath37 , carry out the variation of @xmath38 with respect to @xmath36 and thus find the function @xmath36 minimising @xmath39 .",
    "the solution of this variational minimisation is given by @xmath40^{-1}\\,\\frac{\\hat\\tau(\\vec k)}{p_n(k)}\\;. \\label{eq : optfilter}\\ ] ] this is the usual result showing that the optimal linear filter shape is determined by the shape @xmath41 of the signal , divided by the noise power spectrum .",
    "the filter is thus made most sensitive for those spatial frequencies where the signal @xmath42 is large and the noise @xmath43 is small .      before we can apply this formalism to the observed data , we need to assume a model for the spatial distribution of the signal and a power spectrum describing the noise properties of the data .",
    "concerning the signal , we assume that clusters are on average axially symmetric .",
    "thus , @xmath44 .",
    "specifically , we use the density profile found in numerical simulations by @xcite for modelling the average three - dimensional density profile of dark - matter halos , @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are characteristic density and distance scales , respectively .",
    "these two parameters are not independent , but stochastically related to a single parameter , which can be chosen as the cluster mass .    the gravitational lensing properties of such a mass distribution have been widely explored ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "its lensing potential is given by @xmath48 with @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the projected distance from the lens centre in units of the distance scale , @xmath51 .",

    "( [ eq : k ] ) and ( [ eq : g ] ) .",
    "its fourier transform is defined as @xmath53      as discussed earlier , we take three sources of noise into account .",
    "these are the weak - lensing signal due to the large - scale structure , the shot noise from the finite number of randomly placed galaxies , and the noise due to the random intrinsic shape and orientation of the sources .",
    "the weak gravitational lensing effect of the large - scale structures between the observer and the sources at a comoving distance @xmath54 , observed in the direction @xmath1 on the sky , gives rise to an effective convergence ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "when the sources are distributed in comoving distance , @xmath64 needs to be averaged over the source - distance distribution @xmath65 , @xmath66 where the upper integration limit @xmath67 is the comoving distance to the horizon .",
    "the power spectrum of the effective convergence @xmath68 is related to the power spectrum of the three - dimensional density fluctuations @xmath69 by limber s equation , @xmath70 in which the weight function @xmath71 is given by a line - of - sight integral over distance ratios , @xmath72 the cosmic - shear and effective - convergence power spectra are identical , @xmath73    the noise contributions from random galaxy positions and ellipticities are both modelled as poisson noise , which has a flat power spectrum . the shot - noise power spectrum from the galaxy positions",
    "is given by the number density @xmath74 of suitable galaxies , @xmath75 the noise component caused by the random intrinsic shape and orientation of the background galaxies has a power spectrum whose amplitude depends on the variance @xmath76 of the intrinsic ellipticity distribution , @xmath77 the two noise components are combined into one power spectrum which quantifies the noise of an ellipticity measurement , @xmath78 with the remaining noise components being independent , the total noise power spectrum is the sum of the contributions , @xmath79        the contributions affecting the construction of the optimal filter are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the solid line shows the power spectra of the signal , assuming an nfw lens model of @xmath80 at redshift @xmath81 and a source redshift @xmath82 .",
    "the effective shear power spectrum and the poisson noise are given by the dash - dotted and the dotted lines , respectively , where the latter contains the contributions from the random galaxy positions and their random ellipticities .",
    "the bold solid line shows the filter resulting from eq .",
    "( [ eq : optfilter ] ) . unfortunately , but expectedly , the large - scale structure power is significant on those spatial frequencies where also most of the signal is located .",
    "this implies that it will be impossible to perfectly separate the true signal from the large - scale structure contaminations on the same scales . on the other hand ,",
    "the lensing noise contributed by the large - scale structures on scales larger than the typical scale where the signal power spectrum becomes negligible will be effectively filtered away .",
    "for detecting halos through their weak - lensing signal , the aperture mass statistic ( @xmath83 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is frequently used . due to its favourable statistical properties",
    ", it has turned into one of the prime tools for analysing cosmic - shear statistics .",
    "its application to the detection of the weak - lensing patterns from dark - matter halos has been shown by several authors ( see e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the aperture mass is a weighted integral of the local surface mass density , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the weight function .",
    "if the aperture is chosen to be circular , @xmath86 is axially symmetric , @xmath87 . since the convergence is not directly measurable , eq .",
    "[ eq : map ] is conveniently rewritten in terms of the tangential shear @xmath88 as @xmath89 provided the filter @xmath86 is _ compensated _ , i.e.  satisfies @xmath90 the function @xmath91 is related to @xmath92 by @xmath93 the noise of the aperture mass is given by its variance @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath86 can be chosen such to maximise the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath95 .",
    "@xcite show that this is the case if @xmath96 mimics the tangential shear profile of the lens .",
    "for example , @xcite use a function which approximates the expected shear profile of a nfw halo .",
    "thus , an assumption on the expected profile of the tangential shear needs to be made in the construction of both the optimal filter and the aperture mass . in this respect , the two functions @xmath86 and @xmath41 should be chosen to look very similar .",
    "two differences are important , however .",
    "first , the weight function @xmath86 used in the definition of the aperture mass is compensated , while @xmath41 does not need to be .",
    "the reason is that the aperture mass was specifically defined such as to be proportional to the projected mass enclosed by the aperture .",
    "our goal here is more modest as we only ask for significant halo detections , rather than for a determination of halo parameters apatr from the overall shear amplitude .",
    "this allows us more freedom in the choice of @xmath41 compared to @xmath86 .",
    "second , the shape of the optimal filter differs from the profile function @xmath41 because it is modified by the shape of the total noise power spectrum . a comparison between the optimal filter and the function @xmath91 used by @xcite is shown in fig .  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the solid and the dot - dashed lines refer both to the optimal filter but for two different scale radii used for modelling the signal .",
    "we will show in the following sections how the two filters perform when applied to simulated data .     and @xmath97 ( heavy solid heavy dot - dashed lines , respectively ) .",
    "the large - scale structure power spectrum modifies the filter shape according to the filter scale , by lowering its sensitivity on large scales where weak lensing by large - scale structure dominates . ]",
    "numerical simulations are a unique tool for assessing the performance of the optimal filter , individually and in comparison to the aperture mass . in the following sections we describe the lens models and the numerical methods used for producing simulated catalogues of weakly distorted sources , subsequently analysed with our filter and the aperture - mass statistic .",
    "the numerical model used here is a simulation of a super - cluster like region containing six halos with virial mass larger than @xmath98 .",
    "they are embedded in an over - dense region containing several less massive halos .",
    "the region is a section from an existing dark - matter only large - scale cosmological simulation , later re - simulated at higher resolution using the `` zoomed initial conditions '' ( zic ) technique @xcite .",
    "the parent simulation was an @xmath99-body run of a box of @xmath100 side length containing @xmath101 particles of mass @xmath102 .",
    "the background cosmological model is spatially flat with @xmath103 and @xmath104 at the final epoch , identified with redshift zero @xcite .    from the output of this large cosmological simulation at redshift zero , we selected the super - cluster region for the following re - simulation .",
    "new initial conditions were constructed as follows .",
    "first , the particles contained in the selected region were traced back to their initial ( lagrangian ) positions .",
    "these define a region in lagrangian space . then , the initial density field in that lagrangian region was re - sampled by placing a higher number of particles than were originally present , adding additional small - scale power appropriately .",
    "gas was introduced into the high - resolution region by splitting each parent particle into a gas and a dark - matter particle .",
    "the final mass resolution of these simulation was @xmath105 and @xmath106 for dark matter and gas within the high - resolution region , respectively .",
    "thereby the simulation hosts a usable region of @xmath107 mpc .    finally , the region was evolved down to redshift @xmath108 using the code gadget-2 , a new version of the parallel tree - sph simulation code gadget @xcite .",
    "the simulation was carried out including only non - radiative hydrodynamics .",
    "the comoving gravitational softening length was fixed to @xmath109 ( plummer - equivalent ) .",
    "for the present work , we use the output of the re - simulation at redshift @xmath110 .",
    "we separately analyse six sub - boxes , each of them centred on one of the six most massive halos .",
    "the comoving side - length of each sub - box was set to @xmath111 , corresponding to @xmath112 on the observer s sky .      the particles in each sub - box sample a three - dimensional density field .",
    "their positions are interpolated on a grid of @xmath101 cells using the _ triangular shaped cloud _",
    "method @xcite . then , the three - dimensional density field is projected along its coordinate axes , thus producing three surface density maps , which we use as independent lens planes in the following lensing simulations .",
    "the lensing simulations are performed by tracing a bundle of @xmath113 light rays through a regular grid , covering the central quarter of the lens plane , corresponding to a field of view of @xmath112 .",
    "the deflection angles @xmath114 of each ray @xmath115 are computed according to the method described in several earlier papers ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "from the power spectrum ( [ eq : lss ] ) of the effective convergence , we obtain the power spectrum of the effective lensing potential , @xmath116 since we only aim at measuring the efficiency of our filter for detecting a shear signal , the source redshift distribution is not important .",
    "thus , all sources are assumed to be at the same redshift @xmath117 , considering the two cases @xmath118 or @xmath119 . the upper integration limit in eq .",
    "( [ eq : klss ] ) is then the comoving distance to the source plane , @xmath120 , and the distance distribution of the sources is a delta function , @xmath121    we generate the effective lensing potential in fourier space as a gaussian random field .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha ] ) , we find the large - scale structure contributions to the deflection angles , @xmath122 .",
    "the total deflection angle for each ray @xmath115 is then @xmath123 reduced - shear maps for each field are straightforwardly derived from the deflection angle as explained in sect .",

    "the optimal filter performs much better than the aperture mass in detecting the dark matter concentrations present in our simulated field . on all scales ,",

    "spurious detections occur with both filters .",
    "a further inspection shows that these false matter concentrations are in fact connected to over - densities produced by the projection of the large - scale structures along the line - of - sight . as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect : noises ] , these misidentifications can not strictly be avoided , for the large - scale structure power spectrum is still large on the spatial scales where most of the signal resides . a possible method for discriminating between true halos and large - scale structure superpositions",

    "in fact , the large - scale structure pattern is expected to change for sources at different redshifts .",

    "no detections above @xmath152 are found with @xmath83 , while several true peaks are found using the optimal filter at more than @xmath148 .",
    "apparently the chance of a halo to be detected does not depend only on its mass or on the amplitude of the shear which it is able to produce .",
    "indeed , the noise produced by the large - scale structure can locally disturb the signal , such that even a relatively large halo can fall below detectability due to the local effective shear produced by the large - scale structure . as a simple test ,",
    "we perform several weak - lensing simulations keeping the background galaxy population fixed and changing the large - scale structure in front of them , by using different realisations of the gaussian random deflection - angle field .",

    "spurious halo detections are strongly reduced by using low - redshift sources because of the weaker large - scale structure contribution along the line - of - sight .",

    "compared to fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] the clusters lensing efficency is smaller because of the lower sources distance , but , for the same reason , there is a strong reduction in the large - scale structure contamination which leads to a gain in the signal - to - noise ratio .     for different realizations of the large - scale structure .",

    "the scale of the filter is @xmath139 and the source redshift is @xmath119 . ]    , but with the sources placed at redshift @xmath118 . ]",
    "we have developed a linear filter for detecting the weak - lensing signal of dark - matter halos . given the expected shape @xmath41 of the halo signal , the filter is uniquely determined by the two requirements that it be unbiased and maximise the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the filter shape is modified by the noise power spectrum , into which we include the shot noise from the random positions of the galaxies used to measure the gravitational shear , the noise from their random intrinsic ellipticities , and the weak - lensing signal contributed by the large - scale structure . since the total noise power spectrum is monotonically falling over the scale of the shape function @xmath41 , the inclusion of the noise narrows the filter considerably .",
    "our primary goals are to obtain a filter which separates halos from spurious peaks in the lensing effects of the projected large - scale structure , and whose results are stable against small changes in the filter scale .",
    "our motivation is that applications of another statistic used for detecting dark - matter halos , the aperture mass @xmath153 , tend to detect large numbers of dark peaks , i.e.  peaks in the lensing signal which are not found to correspond to detectable signal in the optical or x - ray wave bands .",
    "moreover , these peak detections tend to be unstable against changes in the characteristic scale of @xmath153 , i.e.  the significance of their detection may change wildly upon even small changes of scale .",
    "it is clear that a clean separation of halos from large - scale structure is impossible because large - scale structure can be considered as being composed of dark - matter halos .",
    "we thus choose the operational definition that the halos we wish to detect are distinguished from large - scale structure as being objects on scales smaller than the non - linear scale .",
    "consequently , we model the large - scale structure `` noise '' in the weak - lensing signal as being due to linearly evolved structures alone .",
    "we perform numerical simulations for testing our new filter .",
    "the results , summarised in figs .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , [ fig:4 ] and [ fig:5 ] , demonstrate that the filter meets all of our goals .",
    "changes in the filter scale leave the signal much more stable than the aperture mass does , as fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] shows .",
    "[ fig:4 ] illustrates that the signal - to - noise ratio produced with our filter is typically substantially higher than that of the aperture mass , and fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] demonstrates that filtering halos against large - scale structure lensing is indeed very efficient .",
    "compared to the aperture mass , the number of spurious peaks is also substantially reduced .",
    "we thus propose this filter as an alternative statistic for detecting dark - matter halos .",
    "of course , the aperture mass remains a very valuable statistic which has its significant strengths in analyses of lensing by large - scale structures .",
    "it appears , however , from our numerical simulations that a fair fraction of the peaks found with the aperture mass may in reality not be caused by halos , but by peaks in the projected large - scale structure ."
