    "the dynamics of rapid brittle cracks exhibits a rich phenomenology that is not yet well understood . for example , crack tip instabilities ( such as a side - branching instability @xcite and an oscillatory one @xcite ) , that were shown to govern fracture dynamics at high propagation velocities , are poorly understood from a fundamental point of view .",
    "the major stumbling block in developing a well - established theory of these phenomena is our lack of understanding of the physics of the `` fracture process zone '' within which nonlinear deformation , dissipation and material separation processes take place .",
    "the classic approach of linear elastic fracture mechanics ( lefm ) assumes infinitesimal deformation outside this typically small process zone and predicts asymptotically `` diverging - like '' strain and stress fields @xcite . under these assumptions",
    "the energy flux into the process zone is calculated and an equation for the rate of crack growth is obtained by equating it to an unknown dissipation function @xmath0 .",
    "this quantity lumps together all the poorly understood nonlinear and dissipative properties of the process zone dynamics @xcite",
    ".    very recent experimental and theoretical work demonstrated explicitly the existence of a nonlinear elastic zone in the near vicinity of a rapidly moving crack tip , where the deformation fields were shown to be quite different from those predicted by lefm @xcite .",
    "one implication of these findings is that although lefm may provide reasonable estimates of the energy flowing to the process zone , it fails to represent properly the ways in which breaking stresses are being transmitted to the crack tip .",
    "therefore , as long as the path of the crack is known and is stable against perturbations , the energy based approach of lefm seems useful ; however , as such conditions are rarely met and the question of path stability is usually of prime importance , the near tip deformation and stress fields themselves may play a central role in describing fast fracture and the associated instabilities .",
    "moreover , these tip instabilities seem to involve a non - geometrical lengthscale ( for example , the minimal side - branch length @xcite or the wavelength of oscillations @xcite ) that is missing in lefm .",
    "thus , the findings of @xcite , that suggest the existence of a dynamical lengthscale associated with the nonlinear elastic zone , shed new light on the search for a missing lengthscale .    motivated by these recent results , we aim at gaining additional insights about the possible roles played by elastic nonlinearities in fracture dynamics and about the possible implications of neglecting these effects in the common linear elastic approach . for that aim",
    "we study in this paper simple one - dimensional models of fracture in which an elastic membrane is being detached from a substrate by the propagation of a decohesion front .",
    "the models are being defined by the following differential equation for the scalar deformation @xmath1 of the membrane @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the linear mass density of the membrane .",
    "the first term on the right - hand - side represents the force per unit length due to the deformation @xmath1 , where the stress @xmath4 is related to @xmath1 through a constitutive law of the form @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the elastic modulus of the membrane and the functional @xmath7 represents a general nonlinear stress - strain relation .",
    "the strain is the displacement gradient @xmath8 .",
    "the second term on the right - hand - side represents the loading of the membrane by elastic springs whose spring constant is @xmath9 and whose natural length is reached when @xmath10 .",
    "note that @xmath6 has the dimension of force , while @xmath9 has the dimension of force / squared length .",
    "the term @xmath11 represents the visco - elastic interaction of the membrane with the substrate .",
    "this term should also include a criterion for detachment from the substrate , serving as a fracture criterion .",
    "similar one - dimensional models were studied previously in relation to various aspects of fracture dynamics , see for example @xcite .",
    "our model follows the spirit of these works and its linear approximation is similar to the model discussed in ref .",
    "our strategy is to study two related models with the same @xmath11 , where in one we consider the solution for a nonlinear @xmath7 and in the other we follow the philosophy of lefm and _ linearize _",
    "@xmath7 first and then solve the model .",
    "our main goal is to compare various aspects of the dynamics of the nonlinear and linearized models in order to gain insights about the role of elastic nonlinearities in the dynamics of fast brittle cracks .",
    "our results show that for sufficiently large @xmath12 there exists a range of small crack tip velocities @xmath13 ( i.e. @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the _ linear _ wave speed ) , such that the linear theory provides reasonable approximations to the nonlinear theory .",
    "however , as the velocity @xmath13 increases the linear approximation deteriorates progressively until it fails to capture important aspects of the dynamics . for smaller values of @xmath12 there",
    "_ exists no range of validity for the linear approximation_.",
    "our conclusion is that in our simple one - dimensional model of fracture lefm inevitably breaks down at finite crack tip velocities , in agreement with the findings of @xcite .",
    "this breakdown can be of significance to the understanding of crack tip instabilities in higher dimensional and more realistic fracture problems .",
    "specifically , we show how elastic nonlinearities affect the limiting crack velocity , the strain and stress fields near the moving crack tip and the dynamical time and length scales involved in the physics of the near tip region .    in sect .",

    "[ sum ] we summarize the results and discuss their possible implications to more realistic , higher dimensional , systems .",

    "( [ stress ] ) and to specify the form of the interaction of the membrane with the substrate @xmath11 . for the latter we choose",
    "@xmath16 this is the cohesion force that binds the membrane to the substrate and can be thought of as the action of visco - elastic springs with a spring constant @xmath17 , a small friction / viscosity - like coefficient @xmath18 and a breaking threshold @xmath19 .",

    "the constitutive law exhibits nonlinear stiffening , i.e. the local tangent to the curve is larger than the tangent at infinitesimal @xmath8 .",
    "note that in the nonlinear softening case the tangent approaches @xmath25 at large strains .",
    "usually , fracture is associated with positive strains .",
    "however , in our simple model the sign of @xmath8 is determined by the direction of crack propagation ; when the crack propagates from right to left we have @xmath23 and the softening branch is selected , while when it propagates from left to right we have @xmath24 and the stiffening branch is selected .",
    "thus , both nonlinear behaviors can be incorporated into our model and we refer to these cases as the nonlinear softening and nonlinear stiffening models respectively . when the linearized relation of eq .",
    "( [ le ] ) is used instead of eq .",
    "( [ nh ] ) , we refer to the model as the linear one .",
    "note that in that case the direction of crack propagation is irrelevant as the linearized relation is symmetric .    in order to prepare eq .",
    "( [ 1d ] ) for the analysis to come we nondimensionalize all of the quantities by measuring length in units of @xmath19 , velocity in units of @xmath26 and force in units of @xmath6 .",

    "our goal in this section is to solve for the steady states of both the linear and nonlinear models and to compare various properties of these solutions .",
    "the tip of the crack is defined as the point where the cohesive springs break and assumed to propagate at a constant velocity @xmath13 . in a co - moving frame @xmath31",
    "the crack tip lies at the origin and @xmath32 .",
    "we now look for a steady state solution of the form @xmath33 .",
    "we start by considering the linear model , for which one can obtain analytic results .      for steady state conditions , eq .",

    "the appearance of a step function , modeling the rupture of the cohesive springs at a critical displacement , implies that the differential equation is ill - defined at @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , we treat separately the positive and negative x domains and demand continuity of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we first consider the domain @xmath40 . in the limit @xmath41",
    "we have @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , we assume a solution of the form @xmath43 , that satisfies @xmath32 . substituting in eq .",

    "we choose the negative root since @xmath40 ( the solution must be bounded ) .",
    "following a similar procedure for @xmath45 , we arrive at    @xmath46\\exp{\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\eta v+\\sqrt{\\eta^2 v^2 + 4(1+\\kappa^2)(1-v^2)}}{2(1-v^2)}\\right)x\\right]},\\quad\\hbox{for}\\quad x<0\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the velocity @xmath13 is still undetermined",

    "note that higher order derivatives at @xmath37 are discontinuous due to the discontinuity of the force at this point . using the continuity of the derivative at @xmath37 we obtain @xmath47 with @xmath48    we are now able to interpret the steady state solutions of the linear model in terms of standard lefm concepts .",
    "@xmath49 , with a fixed @xmath12 , can represent the load and @xmath18 is a material parameter that is related to dissipation . within this interpretation , eq .",
    "( [ vss ] ) tells us that @xmath50 is the critical load needed to initiate crack propagation .",
    "it is a direct analog of the griffith criterion @xcite .",
    "furthermore , eq . ( [ vss ] ) with a fixed @xmath12 represents the velocity - load relation of the model . for @xmath49 close to @xmath50 ,",
    "the velocity of the crack is much smaller than the wave speed , while for sufficiently large @xmath49 the tip velocity approaches the wave speed .",
    "thus , the limiting crack velocity is the wave speed , in complete analogy with the common prediction of lefm in higher dimensions , where the limiting velocity is the rayleigh wave speed @xcite .",
    "the role of the small dissipation coefficient @xmath18 is most clearly demonstrated by multiplying eq .",
    "( [ eom_linearss ] ) by @xmath51 and integrating from @xmath52 to @xmath53 to obtain @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the value of @xmath56 as @xmath57 .",
    "it is important to note that this result holds for _ any _ elastic constitutive law @xmath58 and not only for a linear one . the first term on the left - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ energy_balance ] ) is simply the energy per unit length needed to break the cohesive bonds .",
    "therefore , it is simply the bare surface energy @xmath59 @xmath60 the second term on the left - hand - side is the frictional / viscous dissipation .",
    "together , these two terms result in the fracture energy @xmath61 @xcite @xmath62 the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ energy_balance ] ) is the energy per unit length stored far ahead of the crack tip .",
    "therefore , this is the so - called `` energy release rate '' @xmath63 @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 is obtained by inverting eq .",
    "( [ vss ] ) .",

    "( [ energy_balance ] ) we observe that the velocity @xmath13 is coupled to @xmath18 such that when @xmath18 vanishes @xmath13 does not appear in the equation . therefore , for @xmath67 , there exist steady states only when @xmath68 and in this case , since @xmath69 independently of @xmath13 , the crack can propagate at any velocity .",
    "for @xmath70 we have @xmath71 and there exist no steady states . in that case",
    "the crack is expected to accelerate toward the limiting velocity @xmath72 .",
    "this result is consistent with the @xmath73 limit of eq .",
    "( [ vss ] ) .",
    "however , one should be cautious as this limit predicts that @xmath72 also for @xmath74 , which in light of the discussion above , is wrong . this observation was made previously for a related model @xcite .    in order to set the stage for the comparison between the linear and nonlinear models below",
    ", we should ask what one can learn about this comparison from the steady states of the linear model alone .",
    "intuitively , it is quite clear what determines the range of validity of the linear approximation : it is expected to breakdown if strains significantly larger than a few percent develop over a large enough region near the crack tip .",
    "mathematically speaking , we expect the linear approximation to hold if @xmath75 is sufficiently smaller than @xmath51 almost everywhere . in order to make this qualitative observation more quantitative , we note that the largest strain derived from eq .",

    "moreover , it is an increasing function of the load @xmath49 and @xmath12 , and more importantly , it _ diverges _ in the limit @xmath77 .",
    "thus , we already learn that even if there exists a low velocities range where the linear approximation holds , then it will breakdown at a finite , possibly high , velocity .",
    "in fact , the issue of whether there exists a low velocities range of validity of the linear approximation can be further elucidated by substituting @xmath68 and @xmath78 in eq .",

    "the small amplitude wave speed is independent of deformation and equals to the small strains wave speed , therefore @xmath77 in our dimensionless units .",
