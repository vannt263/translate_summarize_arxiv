    "wave propagation through a multiply scattering medium is an important problem for different disciplines , from optics to acoustics and microwaves  @xcite , since it finds important applications from fundamental physics to biomedical imaging  @xcite .    for a monochromatic coherent input beam ,",
    "the medium typically generates a speckle pattern  @xcite - the result of complex interference between the scattered waves - that is usually considered a major drawback for imaging and focusing . in optics ,",
    "wavefront shaping by spatial light modulators ( slms ) has emerged as a powerful tool to control the speckle and thus light propagation through such complex media  @xcite .",
    "different approaches have been proposed , in particular via optimization methods  @xcite , to focus light through  @xcite or into  @xcite a complex medium . however",
    ", a more general way to understand light propagation is to describe it via its transmission matrix  ( tm )  @xcite , which in essence describes the fact that propagation through a disordered medium , however complex , remains a linear process , and therefore can be described by a linear operator @xmath0 linking input to output modes , i.e. it can be described as @xmath1 .",
    "recently , we introduced a method to measure the monochromatic transmission matrix of a complex medium and to subsequently demonstrate focusing and imaging through it  @xcite .",
    "matricial methods are now widely used to characterize disordered media  @xcite or multimode fibers  @xcite , and even focusing inside complex media  @xcite .    generally speaking",
    ", the medium has a spectrally dependent response , with a spectral correlation bandwidth , @xmath2 , that is inversely related to the confinement time of light in the medium @xmath3  ( @xmath4 )  @xcite.the monochromatic treatment is , therefore , only valid as long as the bandwidth of the source is contained within this spectral correlation bandwidth .",
    "consequently , when light from a broadband source passes through a multiply - scattering medium , its different spectral components generates different speckle patterns .",
    "this is the case where a short pulse - shorter than the average confinement time through the medium - is scattered in space and spread in time .",
    "thanks to the inherent coupling between spatial and spectral degrees of freedom in a scattering medium  @xcite , it is still possible to achieve spatiotemporal focusing through it by optimising the spatial input wavefront  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we show that we are able to measure the multispectral transmission matrix  ( mstm ) of a complex medium -  i.e. the tridimensional matrix that is essentially a set of monochromatic tms  - for several chosen wavelengths .",
    "first , we show that we are able to retrieve the spectral correlation bandwidth of the medium from the spectral correlations in the mstm .",
    "then , exploiting the mstm , we can achieve efficient and deterministic spatiospectral control of a broadband and spatially coherent light source , here a femtosecond pulse , by spatial - only wavefront shaping .",
    "the mstm gives mores flexibility than both the optimization  @xcite and the pulse shaping approach  @xcite to control separately and individually spatial and spectral components of the output fields .",
    "we demonstrate selective spatial focusing of a given wavelength as well as multispectral focusing .",
    "finally , we show that the medium can be turned into a controllable dispersive optical element to focus different spectral components of the pulse at different spatial positions , similarly to a grating  @xcite",
    ".     system ( @xmath5  mm ) conjugates the slm with the back focal plane of a low numerical aperture objective  ( o@xmath6 , na = 0.3 ) that focuses the laser beam on a strongly scattering medium  ( m ) . the transmitted light is then imaged on a ccd camera after polarization selection by a linear polariser  ( p ) .",

    "for the zno samples the correlation bandwidth was lowered by increasing the thickness of the scattering layer .",
    "the shaded areas represent one standard deviation around the average values.,width=306 ]",
    "in essence , in the monochromatic tm measurement approach , a set of input wavefronts , that describes a complete basis of the input modes , is sent through the medium .",
    "part of the beam remains unmodulated and generates a stationary speckle that serves as a reference  @xcite .",
    "using phase - shifting interferometry , the amplitude and phase of the output signal can then be retrieved from a set of speckle images . in order to measure the full mstm ,",
    "the laser is operated in cw mode at a given wavelength followed by the procedure for measuring the monochromatic tm of the medium  @xcite ; this step is then reiterated at every desired wavelength by changing the laser wavelength . in this 3d matrix , the output field at the @xmath20-th pixel on the ccd camera is connected to the input field by    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the element of the mstm linking the @xmath20-th output ccd pixel to the @xmath23-th input slm pixel at frequency @xmath24 . just as in  @xcite ,",
    "the reference is an unknown speckle whose amplitude and phase information is encoded in the @xmath25 coefficients .",
    "since this reference is frequency dependent , the information on the relative local phase between monochromatic tms can not be accessed in this type of measurement .",
    "this measurement , therefore , precludes exact temporal control but still allows spatiospectral control of a broadband light source .",

    "the laser is meant to work in mode - locked pulsed regime  ( central wavelength tunable between @xmath26  nm and @xmath27  nm , pulse duration @xmath28  fs and corresponding bandwidth @xmath29  nm ) but it can also be unlocked and operated as a continuous wave  ( cw ) , tunable laser between @xmath26  nm and @xmath27  nm with a coherence length of @xmath30  cm .",

    "these results can be interpreted as a generalized grating . in terms of resolution and efficiency",
    ", the main difference between our approach and a conventional dispersive element is that , in our case , scattering by the medium itself determines both spectral resolution and spatial localization .",
    "spectral resolution is given by the spectral correlation bandwidth of the medium , linked to the confinement time of the light in the medium , whereas the latter is diffraction - limited , i.e. limited by the effective numerical aperture of the medium .",
    "on the other hand , the efficiency of the spatio - spectral focusing , given by the sbr , is ultimately limited by how many degrees of freedom are controlled , i.e. how many slm pixels and how many speckle grains are controlled simultaneously . in practice , the limitation in number of degrees of control is due to the measurement time , which is limited by the stability of the experimental setup and the medium . here",
    "the measurement time is of the order of 15 minutes for 256 input modes and 6 wavelengths .",
    "this can easily be scaled up by increasing the stability and the modulation speed .",
    "the spectral control is , in this case , deterministic  @xcite . interestingly , unlike a grating , the spatial dispersion of the different spectral foci can be arbitrary as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] , since each independent wavelength can be focused at any spatial position .",
    "in conclusion , we introduced a method to measure the spatially and spectrally resolved transmission matrix , or mstm , of a multiply scattering medium . compared to other approaches based on optimization",
    ", the main advantage of our technique is that it is deterministic . exploiting the information contained in the mstm , we are able to selectively focus one or many spectral components of a broadband light source to one or many arbitrary spatial positions . as a proof of principle",
    ", we demonstrate multispectral focusing of a short pulse , and show the medium can be turned into a deterministic dispersive optical element , thus generalizing the concept of grating . here",
    "we demonstrate spatiospectral control , and our results are valid not only for short laser pulse , but also for temporally incoherent sources such as sleds or supercontinuum sources .",
    "further control of the spectral phase with a plane wave as reference should enable deterministic spatiotemporal control of an ultrashort pulse .",
