    "a key prediction of a number of simple single - field slow - roll inflationary models is that they can not generate detectable non - gaussianity of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature fluctuations within the level of accuracy of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap )  @xcite .",
    "there are , however , several inflationary models that can generate non - gaussianity at a level detectable by the wmap .",
    "these non - gaussian scenarios comprise models based upon a wide range of mechanisms , including special features of the inflation potential and violation of one of the following four conditions : single field , slow roll , canonical kinetic energy , and initial bunch - davies vacuum state .",
    "thus , although convincing detection of a fairly large primordial non - gaussianity in the cmb data would not rule out all inflationary models , it would exclude the entire class of stationary models that satisfy _ simultaneously _ these four conditions ( see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite ) . moreover",
    ", a null detection of deviation from gaussianity would rule out alternative models of the early universe ( see , for example , refs .",
    "thus , a detection or nondetection of primordial non - gaussianity in the cmb data is crucial not only to discriminate ( or even exclude classes of ) inflationary models but also to test alternative scenarios , offering therefore a window into the physics of the primordial universe .",
    "however , there are various non - primordial effects that can also produce non - gaussianity such as , e.g. , unsubtracted foreground contamination , unconsidered point sources emission and systematic errors  @xcite .",
    "thus , the extraction of a possible primordial non - gaussianity is not a simple endeavor . in view of this , a great deal of effort has recently gone into verifying the existence of non - gaussianity by employing several statistical estimators  @xcite ( for related articles see , e.g. , refs .",
    "different indicators can in principle provide information about multiple forms of non - gaussianity that may be present in wmap data .",
    "it is therefore important to test cmb data for deviations from gaussianity by using a range of different statistical tools to quantify or constrain the amount of any non - gaussian signals in the data , and extract information on their possible origins .",
    "a number of recent analyses of cmb data performed with different statistical tools have provided indications of either consistency or deviation from gaussianity in the cmb temperature fluctuations ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in a recent paper",
    "@xcite we proposed two new large - angle non - gaussianity indicators , based on skewness and kurtosis of large - angle patches of cmb maps , which provide measures of the departure from gaussianity on large angular scales .",
    "we used these indicators to search for the large - angle deviation from gaussianity in the three and five - year single frequency maps with a _",
    "kq75 _ mask , and found that while the deviation for the q , v , and w masked maps are within the @xmath0 expected values of monte - carlo ( mc ) statistically gaussian cmb maps , there is a strong indication of deviation from gaussianity ( @xmath1 off the mc ) in the k and ka masked maps .",
    "most of the gaussianity analyses with wmap data have been carried out by using cmb temperature fluctuation maps ( raw and clean ) in the frequency bands q , v and w or some combination of these maps . in these analyses , in order to deal with the diffuse galactic foreground emission , masks such as , for example , _",
    "kq75 _ and _ kp0 _ have been used .",
    "however , sky cuts themselves can potentially induce bias in gaussianity analyses , and on the other hand full - sky maps seem more appropriate to test for gaussianity in the cmb data .",
    "thus , a pertinent question that arises is how the analysis of gaussianity made in ref .",
    "@xcite is modified if whole - sky foreground - reduced cmb maps are used .",
    "our primary objective in this paper is to address this question by extending the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite in three different ways .",
    "first , we use the same statistical indicators to carry out a new analysis of gaussianity of the available _ full - sky foreground - reduced _ five - year and seven - year cmb maps  @xcite .",
    "second , since in these maps the foreground is reduced through different procedures each of the resulting maps should be tested for gaussianity .",
    "thus , we make a quantitative analysis of the effects of distinct cleaning processes in the deviation from gaussianity , quantifying the level of non - gaussianity for each foreground reduction method .",
    "third , we study quantitatively the consequences for the gaussianity analysis of masking the foreground - reduced maps with the _ kq75 _ mask .",
    "an interesting outcome is that this mask lowers significantly the level of deviation from gaussianity even in the foreground - reduced maps , rendering therefore information about the suitability of the foreground - reduced maps as gaussian reconstructions of the full - sky cmb .",
    "the chief idea behind our construction of the non - gaussianity indicators is that a simple way of accessing the deviation from gaussianity distribution of the cmb temperature fluctuations is by calculating the skewness @xmath2 , and the kurtosis @xmath3 from the fluctuations data , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the third and fourth central moments of the distribution , and @xmath6 is its variance . clearly calculating @xmath7 and @xmath8 from the whole sky temperature fluctuations data",
    "would simply yield two dimensionless numbers , which are rough measures of deviation from gaussianity of the temperature fluctuation distribution .",
    "however , one can go further and obtain a great number of values associated to directional information of deviation from gaussianity if instead one takes a discrete set of points @xmath9 homogeneously distributed on the celestial sphere @xmath10 as the center of spherical caps of a given aperture @xmath11 and calculate @xmath12 and @xmath13 from the cmb temperature fluctuations of each spherical cap .",
    "the values @xmath12 and @xmath13 can then be taken as measures of the non - gaussianity in the direction @xmath14 of the center of the spherical cap @xmath15 .",
    "such calculations for the individual caps thus provide quantitative information ( @xmath16 values ) about possible violation of gaussianity in the cmb data .",
    "this procedure is a constructive way of defining two discrete functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( defined on @xmath17 from the temperature fluctuations data , and can be formalized through the following steps ( for more details , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) :    1 .   take a discrete set of points @xmath18 homogeneously distributed on the cmb celestial sphere @xmath10 as the centers of spherical caps of a given aperture @xmath11 ; 2 .",
    "calculate for each spherical cap @xmath19 the skewness ( @xmath12 ) and kurtosis ( @xmath13 ) given , respectively , by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of pixels in the @xmath22 cap , @xmath23 is the temperature at the @xmath24 pixel , @xmath25 is the cmb mean temperature in the @xmath22 cap , and @xmath6 is the standard deviation . clearly , the values @xmath12 and @xmath13 obtained in this way for each cap can be viewed as a measure of non - gaussianity in the direction of the center of the cap @xmath14 ; 3 .",
    "patching together the @xmath12 and @xmath13 values for each spherical cap , one obtains our indicators , i.e. , discrete functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 defined over the celestial sphere , which can be used to measure the deviation from gaussianity as a function of the angular coordinates @xmath28 .",
    "the mollweid projection of skewness and kurtosis functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 are nothing but skewness and kurtosis maps , hereafter we shall refer to them as @xmath29map and @xmath30map , respectively .",
    "now , since @xmath26 and @xmath27 are functions defined on @xmath10 they can be expanded into their spherical harmonics in order to have their power spectra @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "thus , for example , for the skewness indicator @xmath26 one has @xmath33 and can calculate the corresponding angular power spectrum @xmath34 which can be used to quantify the angular scale of the deviation from gaussianity , and also to calculate the statistical significance of such deviation .",
    "obviously , similar expressions hold for the kurtosis @xmath27 .    in the next section",
    "we shall use the statistical indicators @xmath26 and @xmath27 to test for gaussianity the available foreground - reduced maps obtained from the five - year wmap data .",
    "the wmap team has released high angular resolution five - year maps of the cmb temperature fluctuations in the five frequency bands k ( @xmath35 ghz ) , ka ( @xmath36 ghz ) , q ( @xmath37 ghz ) , v ( @xmath38 ghz ) , and w ( @xmath39 ghz ) .",
    "they have also produced a full - sky foreground - reduced internal linear combination ( ilc ) map which is formed from a weighted linear combination of these five frequency band maps in which the weights are chosen in order to minimize the galactic foreground contribution .",
    "it is well known that the _ first - year _ ilc map is inappropriate for cmb scientific studies  @xcite .",
    "however , in the _ five - year _ ( also in the three - year and seven - year ) version of this map a bias correction has been implemented as part of the foreground cleaning process , and the wmap team suggested that this map is suitable for use in large angular scales ( low @xmath40 ) analyses although they admittedly have not performed non - gaussian tests on this version of the ilc map  @xcite . notwithstanding",
    "the many merits of the five - year ilc procedure , some cleaning features of this ilc approach have been considered , and two variants have been proposed recently . in the first approach",
    "the frequency dependent weights were determined in harmonic space  @xcite , while in the second the foreground is reduced by using needlets as the basis of the cleaning process  @xcite .",
    "thus , two new full - sky foreground - cleaned maps have been produced with the wmap five - year data , namely the harmonic ilc ( hilc )  @xcite and the needlet ilc ( nilc ) ( for more details see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the next section ,",
    "we use the full - sky foreground - reduced ilc , hilc and nilc maps with the same smoothed @xmath41 resolution ( which is the resolution of the ilc map ) as the input maps from which we calculate the @xmath26 and @xmath27 maps , and then we compute the associated power spectra in order to carry out a statistical analysis to quantify the levels of deviation from gaussianity.jkim/hilc/ and http://www.apc.univ-paris7.fr/apc_cs/recherche/adamis/cmb_wmap-en.php . ]      in order to minimize the statistical noise , in the calculations of skewness and kurtosis maps ( @xmath29map and @xmath30map ) from the foreground - reduced maps , we have scanned the celestial sphere with spherical caps of aperture @xmath42 , centered at @xmath43 points homogeneously generated on the two - sphere by using the healpix code  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the point - centers of the spherical caps are the center of the pixels of a homogeneous pixelization of the @xmath10 generated by healpix with @xmath44 .",
    "we emphasize , however , that this pixelization is only a practical way of choosing the centers of the caps homogeneously distributed on @xmath10 .",
    "it is not related to the pixelization of the above - mentioned ilc , hilc and nilc input maps that we have utilized to calculate both the @xmath7 and @xmath8 maps from which we compute the associated power spectra .",
    "figures  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] show examples of @xmath7 and @xmath8 maps obtained from the foreground - reduced nilc full - sky and _ kq75 _ maps .",
    "the panels of these figures clearly show regions with higher and lower values ( hot and cold spots ) of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which suggest _ large - angle _ multipole components of non - gaussianity .",
    "we have also calculated similar maps ( with and without the _ kq75 _ mask ) from the ilc and hilc maps . however , since these maps provide only _ qualitative _ information , to avoid repetition we only depict the maps of figs .  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] merely for illustrative purpose .    in order to obtain _ quantitative _ information about the large angular scale ( low @xmath40 ) distributions for the non - gaussianity @xmath7 and @xmath8 maps obtained from the available full - sky foreground - reduced five - year maps , we have calculated the ( low @xmath40 ) power spectra @xmath31 and @xmath32 for these maps .",
    "the statistical significance of these power spectra is estimated by comparing with the corresponding multipole values of the averaged power spectra @xmath47 and @xmath48 calculated from maps obtained by averaging over @xmath49 monte - carlo - generated statistically gaussian cmb maps.cdm model , obtained by randomizing the temperature components @xmath50 within the cosmic variance limits . ] throughout the paper the mean quantities are denoted by overline .    before proceeding to a statistical analysis ,",
    "let us describe with some detail our calculations .",
    "for the sake of brevity , we focus on the skewness indicator @xmath7 , but a completely similar procedure was used for the kurtosis indicator @xmath8 .",
    "we generated @xmath49 mc gaussian ( _ scrambled _ ) cmb maps , which are then used to generate @xmath49 skewness @xmath29maps , from which we calculate @xmath49 power spectra : @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is an enumeration index , and @xmath53 ) . in this way , for each fixed multipole component @xmath54 we have @xmath55 multipole values from which we calculate the mean value @xmath56 . from this mc process",
    "we have at the end ten mean multipole values @xmath47 , each of which are then used for a comparison with the corresponding multipole values @xmath31 ( obtained from the input map ) in order to evaluate the statistical significance of the multipole components @xmath31 . to make this comparison easier , instead of using the angular power spectra @xmath31 and",
    "@xmath32 themselves , we employed the _ differential _ power spectra @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which measure the deviation of the skewness and kurtosis multipole values ( calculated from the foreground - reduced maps ) from the mean multipoles @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( calculated from the gaussian maps ) .",
    "thus , for example , to study the statistical significance of the quadrupole component of the skewness from hilc map @xmath59 ( say ) we calculate the deviation @xmath60 , where the mean quadrupole value @xmath61 is calculated from the @xmath52 quadrupole values of the mc gaussian maps .",
    "it is interesting to note that the deviation from gaussianity as measured by our indicators is greater for the ilc7 than for the ilc5 input map .",
    "concerning this point some words of clarification are in order here .",
    "first , we note that the details of the algorithm used to compute the ilc7 maps are the same as those of the ilc5 map . however , to take into account the most recent updates to the calibration and beams , the frequency weights for each of the 12 regions ( in which the sky is subdivided in the ilc method ) are slightly different in the calculation of the ilc7 map .",
    "second , the difference between the ilc7 and ilc5 maps is a map whose small - scale differences are consistent with the pixel noise , but with a large - scale dipolar component , with the large - scale differences being consistent with a change in dipole of 6.7 @xmath62k@xcite .",
    "thus , the resultant ilc7 map is not indistinguishable from the ilc5 map , and the differences between them have been captured by our indicators .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the differential power spectra calculated from a five - year and seven year version of the foreground - reduced ilc maps with a _",
    "kq75 _ mask .",
    "this figure along with fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] show a significant reduction in the level of deviation from gaussianity when both ilc5 and ilc7 are masked . to quantify this reduction",
    "we have calculated @xmath63 for these input maps with the _ kq75 _ mask , and have collected the results in table  [ chi2-table - ilc5 - 7_kq75 ] .",
    "the comparison of table  [ chi2-table - ilc5 - 7_full - sky ] and table  [ chi2-table - ilc5 - 7_kq75 ] shows quantitatively the reduction of the level of gaussianity for the case of cmb masked maps",
