    "quenching a liquid from supercritical temperatures into the liquid / gas coexistence region leads to the separation of the system into the equilibrium coexisting phases @xcite .",
    "this phase separation process is a paradigmatic illustration of non - equilibrium irreversible processes , whose description must be based on the general fundamental principles of molecular non - equilibrium statistical thermodynamics @xcite . when the final density and temperature of the quench correspond to a state point @xmath0 inside the spinodal region , the separation process starts with the amplification of spatial density fluctuations , eventually leading to the two - phase state in thermodynamic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "however , under some conditions , involving mostly colloidal liquids @xcite , this process of phase separation is interrupted when the colloidal particles cluster in a percolating network of the denser phase , forming an amorphous sponge - like non - equilibrium bicontinuous structure , typical of physical gels @xcite .    in understanding these experimental observations ,",
    "computer simulation experiments in well - defined model systems have also played an essential role .",
    "this includes brownian dynamics ( bd ) @xcite and molecular dynamics ( md ) @xcite investigat of the density- and temperature - dependence of the liquid - gas phase separation kinetics in suddenly - quenched lennard - jones liquids , the bd simulation of gel formation in the colloidal version of the primitive model of electrolytes , and md simulations of bigel formation driven by the demixing of the two colloidal species of a binary mixture@xcite . from the theoretical side ,",
    "on the other hand , a fundamental framework is missing that provides an unified description of both , the irreversible evolution of the structure and dynamics of a liquid suddenly quenched to an unstable homogeneous state , and the possibility that along this irreversible process the system encounters the conditions for its structural and dynamical arrest .    some elements needed to construct the desired unifying theoretical framework",
    "may already be contained in the classical theory of spinodal decomposition @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is not clear how to incorporate in these approaches the main non - equilibrium features of the process of dynamic arrest , including its history dependence and aging behavior .",
    "similarly , it does not seem obvious how to incorporate the non - stationary evolution of the structure and dynamics of a liquid during the process of spinodal decomposition in existing theories of glassy behavior @xcite .",
    "for example , although many of the predictions of conventional mode coupling theory ( mct ) @xcite have found beautiful experimental verification , this theory is unable to describe irreversible non - stationary processes .",
    "the reason for this is that , in its present form , mct is in reality a theory of the dynamics of liquids in their thermodynamic equilibrium states . to overcome this fundamental limitation , in 2000 latz @xcite proposed a formal extension of mct to situations far away from equilibrium which",
    ", however , has not yet found a specific quantitative application .",
    "limitation above is shared by the self - consistent generalized langevin equation ( scgle ) theory of dynamic arrest @xcite , a theory that predicts , in a manner completely analogous to mct , the existence of dynamically arrested states . in contrast to mct , however , the scgle theory has been extended to describe the irreversible non - equilibrium evolution of glass - forming liquids , thus resulting in the _",
    "`` non - equilibrium self - consistent generalized langevin equation '' _ ( ne - scgle ) theory @xcite .",
    "this extended theory provides a conceptually simple picture of the crossover from ergodic equilibration to non - equilibrium aging @xcite , offering a perspective of the glass transition in which the `` waiting''-time @xmath1 becomes a relevant active variable and in which indeed the measured properties of the system may depend on the protocol of preparation and on the duration of the actual measurements .",
    "thus , this non - equilibrium theory may provide the general framework in which to build the missing unified description of the processes of _ arrested _ spinodal decomposition .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to take the first steps in    most general version of the ne - scgle theory of irreversible processes in colloidal liquids @xcite consists of two fundamental time - evolution equations , one for the mean value @xmath2 , and another for the covariance @xmath3 of the fluctuations @xmath4 of the local concentration profile @xmath5 of a colloidal liquid .",
    "thus , in the following section we review this general description , to discuss the form adopted by these equations in the absence of external fields , and the possibility that they allow the description of a fingerprint of spinodal decomposition , namely , the early stage of the amplification of spatial heterogeneities .",
    "the resulting equations are thus restricted to allow the discussion of the simplest explicit protocol of thermal and mechanical preparation , namely , an instantaneous isochoric quench , to describe the spontaneous relaxation of the system toward its equilibrium state or toward predictable arrested states .    in sect .",
    "[ sectioniii ] we apply the resulting approximate theory to the discussion of the possibility that the process of spinodal decomposition may be interrupted by the emergence of dynamic arrest conditions . for the sake of concreteness , there we shall have in mind a very specific model system , namely , the `` hard - sphere plus attractive yukawa '' ( hsay ) potential , subjected to an instantaneous quench at @xmath6 from an initial temperature @xmath7 to a final temperature @xmath8 , with the volume fraction @xmath9 held fixed .",
    "the main focus of this application is the determination of the dynamic arrest diagram in the region of unstable homogeneous states .",
    "according to the predicted scenario , the spinodal curve turns out to be the borderline between the regions of ergodic and non - ergodic homogeneous states , and the high - density liquid - glass transition line , whose high - temperature limit corresponds to the well - known hard - sphere glass transition , actually intersects the spinodal curve at lower temperatures and densities , and continues inside the spinodal region as a glass - glass transition line .",
    "let us start by considering a brownian liquid formed by @xmath10 particles that execute brownian motion ( characterized by a short - time self - diffusion coefficient @xmath11 ) in a volume @xmath12 while interacting between them through a generic pair potential @xmath13 that is the sum of a hard - sphere ( hs ) term @xmath14 with hs diameter @xmath15 , plus an attractive tail @xmath16 .",

    "let us assume that the thermal diffusivity of the system is sufficiently large that any temperature gradient is dissipated almost instantly ( compared with the relaxation of chemical potential gradients ) , so that the temperature field inside the system can be considered uniform , and instantly equal to the temperature of the reservoir , @xmath20 .",
