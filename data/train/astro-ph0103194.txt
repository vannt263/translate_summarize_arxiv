    "recent experiments and observations have already opened up what one can actually call the era of precision cosmology .",
    "it is now hoped that next years will see rather impressive advances leading not just to the determination of key cosmological parameters with an accuracy not even dreamed five years ago , but also to unprecedented scrutinies on fundamental aspects of particle and field theories .",
    "in particular , the connection between recent boomerang ( de bernardis et al .",
    "2000 ) and maxima ( hanany et al . 2000 ) experiments with theory is twofold .",
    "they are linked through predictions from either inflationary ( and perhaps cosmic string ) models by using fundamental particle physics arguments ( hu and white 1996 ) or from general more or less standard cosmological scenarios which may or may not include some new concepts such as quintessence ( cadwell , dave and steinhardt 1998 ) .",
    "the aim of this paper will concentrate at a particular aspect of cmb anisotropy measurements : the dependence of the position of the first doppler peak on the values of the relevant cosmological parameters within the realm of a quintessence model .",
    "kamionkowski , spergel and sugiyama ( 1994 ) originally derived the simple relation that the position of the first doppler peak @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , which has been the subject of some controversy . while frampton , ng and rohm ( 1998 ) have recently derived a similar dependence using a simple quintessential model , weinberg ( 2000 )",
    "has argued that this formula is not even a crude approximation when @xmath4 is smaller than @xmath5 . for a very recent discussion on quntessential model of cmb anisotropies",
    "see bond et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . assuming the holding of the cosmic triangle condition",
    ", we obtain in this paper that @xmath6 only depends on the topology of the universe , so confirming the original proposal by kamionkowski , spergel and sugiyama ( 1994 ) .",
    "in order to derive an expression relating the position of the first doppler peak with the scalar field potential of quintessence models , we choose a general tracking model with time - dependent parameter @xmath7 for the state equation ( zlatev , wang and steinhardt 1999 ) . this kind of models can be related to particle physics and may solve the so - called cosmic coincidence problem ( steinhardt 1997 ) .",
    "one typically considers tracking quintessence fields @xmath8 for a ratra - peebles potential @xmath9 with a given constant parameter @xmath10 ( ratra and peebles 1988 ) . during its cosmic evolution , the equation of state parameter @xmath11 passes through several distinct regimes ( brax , martin and riazuelo 2000 ) , including first a kinetic regime lasting until @xmath12 with @xmath13 , then the transition and potential regimes chracterized by @xmath14 , to finally reach the proper tracking regime at @xmath15 , where @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 for radiation dominated universe and @xmath18 for matter dominated universe ) . on this regime , there exists a particular solution for the scalar field , @xmath19 ( in which @xmath20 is the conformal time , with @xmath21 the scale factor ) which is an attractor able to solve the cosmic coincidence problem .    for @xmath22 a change of @xmath11",
    "should then be expected when the universe becomes matter dominated once the the surface of last scattering is overcome . since the tracking regime is characterized by @xmath23 ( @xmath24 being the sound velocity defined as @xmath25 ( brax , martin and riazuelo 2000 ) ) , parameter @xmath11 becomes a constant given by @xmath26 when matter dominates .",
    "it has been recently argued that @xmath27 ( balbi et al . 2001 ) , so that if we choose for definiteness @xmath28 , then @xmath29 for the vacuum quintessence field . in this case , the ratra - peebles potential becomes @xmath30 since the corresponding tracking solution , @xmath31 , would then correspond to a constant parameter @xmath32 for the quintessence field , it should satisfy the constraint equation derived from the corresponding conservation laws and cosmological field equations ( di pietro and demaret 1999 , gonzlez - daz 2000 ) . in terms of the cosmological parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and the quintessence field potential @xmath35",
    ", this constraint equation can be written as ( gonzlez - daz 2000 ) @xmath36 @xmath37 } + \\omega_{\\lambda}\\left(\\frac{v}{v_0}\\right)^{(3\\omega+4)/[3(\\omega+1)]},\\ ] ] where @xmath38 , the subscript 0 means current value and @xmath39 .",
    "( 2 ) corresponds to the generalized quintessence model with negative constant parameter for the state equation recently suggested ( gonzlez - daz 2000 ) .",
    "besides the contributions from the topological curvature , @xmath40 , and gravitationally observable mass , @xmath41 , this model distinguishes two essentially distinct contributions from vacuum energy : a varying cosmological term with positive energy density @xmath5 assumed to satisfy the conservation law @xmath42 at sufficiently small redshifts , and a quintessence negative energy density such that while @xmath43 ( @xmath44 being the current value of the hubble constant ) is always negative , @xmath45 is always positive , so satisfying the ford - roman s quantum interest conjecture ( ford and roman 1999 ) .",
    "adapting then the relation between the position of the first doppler peak @xmath6 and the cosmological parameters @xmath33 first derived by frampton , ng and rohm ( 1998)to our generalized model , we can finally obtain a general relation between @xmath6 and the quintessence potential @xmath35 of the form : @xmath46 @xmath47}\\right]\\right|_{z = z_r } s\\left\\{\\frac{\\sqrt{|\\omega_k|}v_0 ' } { 3(\\omega+1)v_0 } \\int_{\\phi(z=0)}^{\\phi(z = z_r ) } \\frac{d\\phi}{\\left(\\frac{v}{v_0}\\right)^{(3\\omega+1)/[6(\\omega+1)]}}\\right\\ } , \\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the redshift at recombination , we have used the relation ( di pietro and demaret 1999 ) @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath51 , @xmath52 for @xmath53 and @xmath54 for @xmath55 . in the case of interest",
    "@xmath29 , where we obtain both topological and dynamical acceleration , eqn . ( 3 ) reduces to @xmath56\\right|_{z = z_r } s\\left\\{\\frac{\\sqrt{|\\omega_k|}v_0 ' } { v_0 } \\int_{\\phi(z=0)}^{\\phi(z = z_r)}d\\phi\\left(\\frac{v}{v_0}\\right)^{1/2}\\right\\ } , \\ ] ] and there is a solution to the constraint equation ( 2 ) given by @xmath57+\\xi_0\\right\\}^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath58 @xmath59 in this case , the cosmological parameters must satisfy the relations @xmath60\\geq 0\\ ] ] @xmath61 > 0 .\\ ] ] together with the triangle equation @xmath62 , eqns .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 10 ) will restrict the values that the cosmological parameters may take on . on the other hand , we note from eqns .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 6 ) that for large @xmath63 and @xmath64 one obtains @xmath65 and @xmath66 ; that is , while the potential ( 6 ) can be consistently interpreted as a generalization for smaller values of @xmath63 from the ratra - peebles potential , the attractor solution @xmath67 must necessarily change into @xmath68 as the universe becomes matter dominated .    performing the derivative and integration in eqn . ( 5 ) after inserting solution ( 6 ) , we finally obtain for the position of the first doppler peak when @xmath29 @xmath69 } \\left.t\\left\\{\\sqrt{\\frac{|\\omega_k|}{\\omega_v\\varphi_0 } } f\\left[\\varphi(z ) , r_0\\right]\\right|_{0}^{z_r}\\right\\ } , \\ ] ] where @xmath70 $ ] is the elliptic integral of the first kind ( abramowitz and stegun 1965 ) , @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 and @xmath74 for @xmath51 and , unlike the function @xmath75 , @xmath76 both for the closed and open cases .",
    "@xmath0 can run between two extreme values , such that @xmath77    a plot for the position of the first doppler peak , @xmath6 , against the parameter @xmath0 is given in fig .",
    "it can be seen that the maximum value for @xmath6 is reached when @xmath6 approaches the value 190 at the flat case @xmath51 , decreasing slowly therefrom as @xmath78 increases , a little more steeply for @xmath79 than for @xmath53 .",
    "this seems to quite reasonably reproduce the results provided by boomerang , maxima and previous ( netterfield et al .",
    "1997 , vollaek et al .",
    "1997 ) experiments .",
    "although uncertainties about our results for @xmath29 must come from the possibility of having values of @xmath10 other than just unity ( provided they are on the interval ( 0,2 ) , or small deviation from time - independence of @xmath11 during cosmic evolution after recombination , they seems to strongly suggest a nearly flat topology for the universe .",
    "we note that cbm anisotropies and cosmic acceleration can be easily related in our model . to see this , let us consider solution ( 6 ) for the the flat case , i.e. @xmath80\\right\\}^{-1 } , \\ ] ] with @xmath81 this allows us to also construct a plot for the luminosity distance versus redshift by using the expression ( gonzlez - daz 2000 ) @xmath82\\right|_{0}^{z}\\right\\ } .\\ ] ] one can see readily that our flat solution in fact gives rise to a @xmath83 plot with a nearly straight line between @xmath84 and @xmath85 which appears to slightly accelerate thereafter , the full @xmath86 that corresponds to the @xmath63-interval of presently available type ia supernova observations , @xmath87 $ ] , being around 12 .",
    "this accelerating behaviour for the universe conforms quite well the data obtained from distant supernova ia ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 , reiss et al .",
    "it is worth noticing that though our universe model is dynamically accelerating it still is topologically uniform as @xmath88 exactly vanishes in the flat case .",
    "as one separates from flatness one model produces topologically decelerating scenarios .",
    "consistent solutions to the constraint equation for the quintessence potential have been obtained which all correspond to particular fixed sets of values for @xmath33 , @xmath89 , in such a way that the resulting value of the position of the first doppler peak @xmath6 becomes automatically fixed once just one of the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath4 or @xmath90 is fixed , but does not depend on the ratio @xmath91 .",
    "one can also conclude that @xmath6 acquires a maximum value which fits fairly well experimental results at @xmath51 ( i.e. @xmath92 ) . as the topology of the universe separates from flatness",
    "( @xmath93 if @xmath94 , or @xmath95 if @xmath96 ) , @xmath6 always decreases from its maximum value . since @xmath97",
    ", from the condition that @xmath98 be real it follows that the quintessence field @xmath8 is pure imaginary .",
    "this amounts to the interpretation that the classical solution is axionic , and hence the quintessence field can be taken as a genuine component of dark matter in such a way that one can define for the gravitationally observable mass of the universe the quantity @xmath99 , with @xmath100 .",
    "thus , one can always adjust our results to the currently favoured combination @xmath101 , @xmath102 for any @xmath0 .",
    "we finally remark that the results obtained in this paper refer only to the case of a quintessence parameter for state equation @xmath29 ( i.e. @xmath28 ) .",
    "it is expected that results even more adjusted to observation ( i.e. closer to 200 ) can also be obtained within the model of this paper by slightly shifting @xmath11 towards more realistic smaller values approaching -0.8 .",
