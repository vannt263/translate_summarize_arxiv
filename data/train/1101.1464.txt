    "precision frequency measurements @xcite of a stabilized laser source are of great importance in the field of metrology @xcite as well as atomic , molecular @xcite and optical physics @xcite . here",
    "we show that weak values @xcite in an optical deflection measurement experiment @xcite can produce frequency shift resolutions down to 129 @xmath0 7 @xmath1 with only 2 mw of continuous wave optical power . by performing a weak measurement of the deflection of an infrared laser source that has passed through a weakly dispersive prism , we are able to measure a change in optical frequency comparable to precision fabry - perot interferometers @xcite .",
    "this technique is relatively simple , requiring only a few common optical components and operating at atmospheric pressure .",
    "additionally , we show that this technique has low noise over a large range of response frequencies , making it desirable for many applications such as doppler anemometry @xcite , tests of the isotropy of light propagation @xcite or laser locking without the use of high finesse fabry - perot interferometers @xcite or atomic lines .",
    "first developed as a way to understand preselected and postselected quantum measurements and how they relate to time - reversal symmetry in quantum mechanics , the _ weak value _",
    "@xmath2 of an operator @xmath3 was introduced in a seminal 1988 paper by aharonov , albert and vaidman ( aav ) @xcite .",
    "the weak value is given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 are the preselected and postselected states of the system , respectively .",
    "this quantity , which is likened to the expectation value of @xmath3 , can have seemingly strange behavior , particularly in the limit where the preselected and postselected states are nearly orthogonal . while numerous experiments have validated the initial claims of the aav paper @xcite , there are new developments concerning the interpretation of preselected and postselected weak measurements @xcite .",
    "weak values are a result of a so - called weak measurement , _",
    "i.e. , _ a measurement which gains only partial information about the state of a system .",
    "unlike von neumann measurements , a weak measurement disturbs the measured state of the system only minimally .",
    "for this reason , weak measurements have been useful in reconsidering hardy s paradox @xcite as well as making meaningful , sequential measurements of noncommuting observables @xcite .",
    "furthermore , due to the denominator of @xmath2 , there can be a large amplification of the weak value when the preselected and postselected states are nearly orthogonal ; as a result , there have been a number of experimental results published in the field of optical metrology @xcite .",
    "there is also a vast array of results , both theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite , which have gone a long way to further our understanding of the weak measurement process .",
    "we describe here the frequency amplification experiment shown in fig .  1 by further developing the ideas of ref .  .",
    "although the actual experiment uses a classical beam , we choose to characterize the weak value effect one photon at a time ; this is valid , owing to the fact that we consider here a linear system with a coherent laser beam modeled as a linear superposition of fock states @xcite .    in this experiment",
    ", a single - mode gaussian beam of frequency @xmath6 and radius @xmath7 passes through an optical isolator , resulting in linearly polarized light .",
    "we assume that the radius is large enough to ignore divergence due to propagation .",
    "light then enters a sagnac interferometer containing a 50:50 beam splitter ( bs ) , a mirror and a prism .",
    "the beam travels clockwise and counter - clockwise through the interferometer , denoted by the system states given by \\{@xmath8 } ; we write the photon meter states in the position basis as \\{@xmath9 } , where @xmath10 denotes the transverse , _ horizontal _ direction .",
    "initially , the interferometer ( including the prism ) is aligned such that the split photon wave function spatially overlaps ( _ i.e. , _ the photons travel the same path whether by @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) .",
    "after the interferometer is aligned , the photons traversing each path receive a small , constant momentum kick in the _ vertical _ direction ; this vertical kick is controlled by the interferometer mirror and results in a misalignment . due to its spatial asymmetry about the input bs",
    ", this momentum kick creates an overall phase difference @xmath13 between the two paths . by adjusting the interferometer mirror",
    ", we can control the amount of light that exits the interferometer into the dark port . while the amplified signal ultimately depends on the value of @xmath13 , and therefore on the magnitude of the misalignment , the _ signal to noise ratio _ ( snr ) is unaffected ( discussed below ) .",
    "we then let @xmath14 represent the small momentum kick given by the prism to the beam ( after alignment ) in the horizontal @xmath10-direction .",
    "the _ system _ and _ meter _ are entangled via an impulsive interaction hamiltonian @xcite ( resulting in a new state @xmath15 ) such that a measurement of the horizontal position of the photon after it exits the interferometer gives us some information about which path the photon took .",
    "we consider a horizontal deflection that is significantly smaller than the spread of the wave packet we are trying to measure , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath16 . in this approximation",
    ", we find that the postselected state of the photons exiting the dark port is given by @xmath17 , \\label{state}\\ ] ] where the weak value , defined above , is given by @xmath18 for small @xmath13 .",
    "there are two interesting features of eq .",
    "( [ state ] ) .",
    "first , the probability of detecting a photon has been reduced to @xmath19 , and yet the snr of an ensemble of measurements is nearly quantum limited @xcite despite not measuring the vast majority of the light .",
    "second , the weak value ( which can be arbitrarily large in theory ) appears to amplify the momentum kick @xmath14 given by the prism ; the resulting average position is given by @xmath20 , where the angular brackets denote an expectation value .",
    "we can compare this to the standard deflection caused by a prism measured at a distance @xmath21 which is given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the wavenumber of the light .    in order to predict the deflections @xmath24 or @xmath25",
    ", we must know the form of @xmath14 . for a prism oriented such that it imparts the minimum deviation on a beam ,",
    "the total angular deviation is given by @xmath26-\\gamma$ ] , where @xmath27 is the index of refraction of the material and @xmath28 is the angle at the apex of the prism @xcite .",
    "however , we are only interested in the small , frequency - dependent angular deflection @xmath29^{-2}-[n(\\omega)]^2\\}^{-1/2}$ ] , where @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) is the index change in the prism ( angular deflection of the beam ) for a given frequency change of the laser . the small _ momentum kick _ is expressed as @xmath32",
    ". we can then write the amplified deflection as @xmath33^{-2}-[n(\\omega)]^2}}. \\label{deflection}\\ ] ]    the frequency - dependent index @xmath27 of fused silica , which was used in this experiment , can be modeled using the sellmeier equation @xcite .",
    "we can therefore calculate the expected @xmath25 using eq .",
    "( [ deflection ] ) .",
    "however , to compute the ultimate sensitivity of this weak value frequency measurement , we must include possible noise sources .",
    "if we consider only shot - noise from the laser , the snr for small @xmath13 is approximated by @xmath34 as shown in ref .  , where @xmath35 is the number of photons used in the interferometer .",
    "note that @xmath35 is not the number of photons striking the detector , which is given by @xmath36 . by setting @xmath37 and using modest values for @xmath35 , @xmath7 and @xmath6",
    ", we find that frequency sensitivities well below 1 khz are possible",
    ". however , other sources of noise , such as detector dark current , radiation pressure and environmental perturbations will reduce the sensitivity of the device .",
    "in our experimental setup ( shown in fig .  1 ) , we used a fiber - coupled 780 nm external cavity diode laser with a beam radius of @xmath38 m .",
    "the frequency of the laser was modulated with a 10 hz sine wave using piezo controlled grating feedback .",
    "the frequency control was calibrated using saturation absorption spectroscopy of the hyperfine excited states of the rubidium d2 line@xcite : @xmath39 @xmath40 transitions of rubidium 85 and the @xmath41 @xmath42 transitions of rubidium 87 .",
    "linearly polarized light was divided before the interferometer using a 50:50 bs ( although an imbalanced ratio here would be ideal for practical applications ) .",
    "the light in one port was measured with a photodiode and used to lock the power at 2 mw with an acousto - optic modulator before the fiber .",
    "the interferometer was approximately @xmath43 cm in length ; the mirror used to adjust @xmath13 was approximately 6 cm from the input bs ( measured counter clockwise ) and the prism , made of fused silica , was approximately 5 cm from the input bs ( measured clockwise ) .",
    "although the prism was not symmetrically placed in the interferometer as described in the theory above , the results are the same aside from a global offset in position which can be subtracted off during processing .",
    "the interferometer was first aligned to minimize light in the dark port and then , using the aforementioned mirror , misaligned to allow a small percentage of the light ( @xmath442 - 5% ) into the dark port .",
    "the position of this light was measured using a split detector ( new focus model 2921 ) .",
    "the signal was passed through two 6 db / octave bandpass filters centered at 10 hz and amplified by a factor of about @xmath45 .    for fig .  2 , we measured the peak of the deflection in each 100 ms cycle , repeated 25 times",
    "; we computed the average and the standard deviation of this set as we varied the change in the optical frequency .",
    "we find that the amplified deflection is a linear function of oscillating optical frequency given by about 720 @xmath0 11 pm / mhz .",
    "compared to the unamplified deflection of about 9.1 pm / mhz given by the expression for @xmath24 , this gives an amplification factor of 79 @xmath0 1.2 and a computed @xmath46 of 1.3% ; this agrees with the measured @xmath46 of 2 - 5% if we include the extra light present in the signal due to phase front distortions from imperfect optics .",
    "a characteristic noise scan was taken and plotted in fig .  3 with and without frequency modulation .",
    "the signal was passed directly from the split detector into the oscilloscope before performing a fast fourier transform .",
    "data was taken with and without a 7.4 mhz optical frequency modulation to show the noise floor over a large bandwidth .",
    "the noise at higher frequencies was similarly flat .",
    "second , to test the range over which this device could function , we optimized the interferometer at the low - frequency end of the laser s tuning range and obtained a snr of approximately 19 with the 7.4 mhz optical frequency modulation .",
    "we then tuned to the high - frequency end of the laser s tuning range ( @xmath47 ghz ) , without adjusting or recalibrating the interferometer , and obtained a snr of 10 .",
    "in fact , this range can be much larger so long as the weak value condition @xmath16 is satisfied ; for our beam radius and optical frequency , we could in principle measure over a range of 5 thz , or about 10 nm .    for our experimental parameters",
    ", we can measure below 1 mhz of frequency change with a snr around 1 , as shown in fig .",
    "it should be noted that , although the time between measurements is a full 100 ms , our filtering limits the laser noise to time scales of about 30 ms . for analysis",
    ", we take this as our integration time in estimating @xmath35 for each measurement .",
    "the resulting sensitivity for our apparatus is 129 @xmath0 7 @xmath48 ; _",
    "e.g. , _ if we had integrated for 1 s instead of 30 ms , this device could measure a 129 khz shift in frequency with a snr of 1 .",
    "the error in frequency comes from the calibration described above . using eq .",
    "( [ snr ] ) , we find that the ideal ultimate sensitivity is approximately 67 @xmath48 .",
    "this implies that this apparatus , operating at atmospheric pressure with modest frequency filtering , is less than a factor of two away from the shot - noise limit in sensitivity .",
    "this is no longer surprising since we now understand the fact that weak value experiments amplify the signal , but not the technical noise @xcite .",
    "with only 2 mw of continuous wave input power , we have measured a frequency shift of 129 @xmath0 7 @xmath48 ; we have shown that the system is stable over our maximum tuning range of 140 ghz without recalibration and is nearly shot - noise - limited . with more optical power , longer integration and a more dispersive element such as a grating or a prism with @xmath49 , the sensitivity of this device can measure frequency shifts lower than 1 khz , although a higher sensitivity comes at the cost of maximum tuning range . compare this to commercially available fabry - perot interferometers , which report typical resolutions down to 5 mhz and free spectral ranges of only 1 - 5 ghz .",
    "more sensitive fabry - perot interferometers exist , yet they require a host of custom equipment to reduce environment noise , including vacuum systems and vibration damping .",
    "moreover , an important advantage of this technique is that a large percentage ( @xmath4490% ) of the light used in the interferometer can then be sent off to another experiment ( as indicated in fig .  1 ) , allowing for real - time frequency information during data collection .",
    "while this device can not compare to the absolute frequency sensitivity of frequency combs @xcite , we believe that this method is a simple solution for high - resolution , relative frequency metrology and will serve as a valuable laser - locking tool .",
