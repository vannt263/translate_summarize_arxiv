    "<S> many reviews of cosmic - ray theory and observations are available in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> most of these reviews concentrate on different aspects and energy ranges of high - energy cosmic rays which , in turn , are presented in much more detail than possible here . for example , covering the knee energy region , experimental data are compiled in @xcite and a comparison of observations and model predictions can be found in @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> an exhaustive compilation of experimental results of the full cosmic - ray energy range can be found in @xcite and a recent review , emphasizing measurement and analysis techniques , is given in @xcite .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss high - energy cosmic - ray measurements covering the energy range from the knee to the highest energies . by concentrating mainly on observational results of the last decade and their implications for our overall understanding of cosmic rays , </S>",
    "<S> this review is complementary to the other articles .    the exploration of cosmic rays is mainly driven by new experimental findings . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we begin this review with a short historical overview , followed by an introduction to the physics of high - energy cosmic rays ( ) .    in the energy region of interest cosmic rays are measured indirectly with large detector installations below the atmosphere , registering secondary particles produced in extensive air showers , initiated by high - energy cosmic rays . </S>",

    "<S> concluding remarks ( ) complete the review .      </S>",
    "<S> cosmic rays were discovered in the year 1912 by v.f . </S>",
    "<S> hess during several ascends with hydrogen - filled balloons up to altitudes of 5  km @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> he measured the ionization rate of air as function of altitude . </S>",
    "<S> electrometers served as standard devices to measure ionizing radiation at this time @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hess found an increase of ionizing radiation with increasing height and he concluded that radiation penetrates from outer space into the atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> for the discovery of the cosmic radiation , v.f .  </S>",
    "<S> hess has been awarded the nobel price in 1936 . during the subsequent years w. kolhrster made further ascends with improved electrometers , measuring the altitude variation of the ionization up to heights of 9  km @xcite .    in 1929 </S>",
    "<S> w.  bothe and w.  kolhrster measured coincident signals in two geiger - mller counters @xcite . placing absorber material in between the two counters they also measured the absorption characteristics of the radiation . </S>",
    "<S> they concluded that the `` hhenstrahlung '' ( or cosmic radiation ) is of corpuscular nature , i.e.   consists of charged particles . </S>",
    "<S> similar conclusions were drawn from measurements by j. clay , who showed that the intensity of cosmic rays depends on the ( magnetic ) latitude of the observer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this was a clear indication that a large fraction of cosmic radiation consists of charged particles .    </S>",
    "<S> kolhrster continued his work with geiger - mller tubes operated in coincidence . in february 1938 </S>",
    "<S> he reported the discovery of coincident signals between two tubes with distances as far as 75  m @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> he concluded that the tubes were hit by secondary particles or showers generated by cosmic rays in the atmosphere . in the late 1930s p.  auger undertook investigations of cosmic radiation at the jungfraujoch , switzerland at 3500  m.a.s.l . </S>",
    "<S> he used wilson chambers and geiger - mller tubes separated by large distances and operated in coincidence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar to kolhrster , auger concluded that the registered particles are secondaries generated in the atmosphere , originating from a single primary cosmic ray .    in the 1940s the origin of the primary radiation </S>",
    "<S> could be revealed with measurements on balloons at high altitudes . </S>",
    "<S> m. schein showed that the positively charged primary particles were mostly protons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cloud chambers and photographic plates were carried into the stratosphere and it was found that cosmic rays are made up of fully ionized atomic nuclei moving at speeds closely to that of light @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many nuclei of the periodic table up to @xmath2 were found and their relative abundances determined . </S>",
    "<S> hydrogen and helium occur most frequently , and the distribution in mass of the heavier nuclei appeared to be similar to that in the solar system . </S>",
    "<S> elements more massive than iron or nickel were found to be very rare .    since the mid 1940s large detector arrays were installed to measure extensive air showers . for most investigations detectors with a large surface and a short time resolution were required . </S>",
    "<S> early detectors comprised geiger - mller counters , progress in the development of photomultipliers lead to the application of scintillation counters and the newly available detectors . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the energy spectrum of cosmic rays follows a power law @xmath3 over a wide range in energy . in 1958 g.v .  </S>",
    "<S> kulikov and g.b .  </S>",
    "<S> khristiansen measured the integral electron number spectrum in air showers using an array of hodoscope counters @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they recognized a kink in the spectrum around @xmath4 particles , corresponding to primary energies of several pev ( @xmath0ev ) . </S>",
    "<S> this structure is now known as the `` knee '' in the energy spectrum . since that time there is an ongoing debate about the origin of this structure .    in the 1960s </S>",
    "<S> the air shower array of the m.i.t . </S>",
    "<S> group at volcano ranch , new mexico was the largest cosmic - ray detector . </S>",
    "<S> the set - up comprised 20 stations equipped with scintillation counters , set up on a triangular grid , covering a total area of 12  km@xmath5 . in 1962 the first event with an energy of about @xmath6  ev has been recorded with this array @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> bigger air shower arrays were built ( sugar @xcite , haverah park @xcite , yakutsk @xcite , and agasa @xcite ) and , after some initial attempts , the first successful fluorescence light detector , called fly s eye , was set up in utah @xcite . with these detectors , another feature of the cosmic - ray flux  </S>",
    "<S> first discussed in @xcite  was firmly established in the early 1990s and is now known as the `` ankle '' @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally it should be mentioned that , in the early years , particle physics was done mainly by studying cosmic rays . in the 1930s </S>",
    "<S> investigations of the cosmic radiation lead to the discovery of new elementary particles such as the positron @xcite or the muon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pion was discovered exposing nuclear emulsions to cosmic radiation at mountain altitudes in 1947 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> new unstable hadrons were found in cosmic - ray interactions in balloon - borne emulsion chambers @xcite in 1971 which were later , after the discovery of charm particles , identified as d mesons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also a number of exotic phenomena were observed @xcite , none of which could be confirmed in accelerator experiments .    over time </S>",
    "<S> a standard description of cosmic rays evolved , which is briefly sketched in the following section .           </S>",
    "<S> [ abundance ]    the solar system is permanently exposed to a flux of highly energetic ionized atomic nuclei  the cosmic rays . </S>",
    "<S> their energies extend from the mev range to at least @xmath6  ev . the differential energy spectrum of all cosmic - ray particles is depicted in . </S>",
    "<S> it falls steeply as function of energy , decreasing by about a factor 500 per decade in energy . </S>",
    "<S> the flux decreases from more than 1000 particles per second and square meter at gev energies to about one particle per m@xmath5 and year at a pev , and further to less than one particle per km@xmath5 and century above 100  eev .    </S>",
    "<S> the strong decrease in flux poses a big experimental challenge and our knowledge about the particles and their origin is more and more limited with increasing energy ( and decreasing flux ) . at sub - gev energies individual isotopes </S>",
    "<S> are measured with small detectors in outer space and individual elements can be resolved with balloon - borne detectors in the tev regime . at energies exceeding 100  tev </S>",
    "<S> large detection areas are required to collect a suitable number of particles in a reasonable time . at present , </S>",
    "<S> such detectors are realized at ground level only and secondary particles generated in the atmosphere ( the extensive air showers ) are registered . at pev energies , groups of elements could be resolved , while at the highest energies even a classification into `` light '' and `` heavy '' particles becomes already an experimental challenge .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy spectrum follows a power law @xmath7 over a wide energy range , indicating non - thermal acceleration processes . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum is rather featureless as can be inferred from . </S>",
    "<S> however , small structures become clearly visible when the ordinate is multiplied with some power of the particle energy , as shall be discussed below ( see e.g. ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral index is @xmath8 at energies up to several pev . </S>",
    "<S> then a steepening is observed , the so - called _ knee _ , with @xmath9 at higher energies . a further steepening , the _ second knee _ , occurs around @xmath10ev . </S>",
    "<S> finally , at about @xmath11ev , at the _ ankle _ , the spectrum flattens again .    </S>",
    "<S> the abundance of elements in cosmic rays is shown in as function of the nuclear charge number . </S>",
    "<S> all elements of the periodic table have been found in cosmic rays . </S>",
    "<S> for the relatively abundant elements up to nickel , energy spectra for individual elements have been measured @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> abundances as obtained by several experiments at about 1  gev / n are depicted . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmic - ray composition is compared to the abundance of elements in the solar system . </S>",
    "<S> overall , both distributions look very alike . </S>",
    "<S> however , there exist certain differences , which reveal information on the acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays .    </S>",
    "<S> the light elements lithium , beryllium , and boron as well as the elements below iron ( @xmath12 ) and below lead ( @xmath13 ) are more abundant in cosmic rays than in the solar system . </S>",
    "<S> they are assumed to be produced in spallation processes of the more abundant particles of the cno , iron , and lead groups during the journey of cosmic rays through the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> hence , they are frequently referred to as secondary cosmic rays . as the spallation cross section of the relevant nuclei is known at gev energies , the ratio of secondary to primary cosmic rays is used to infer the propagation path length of cosmic rays in the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> an example is the boron - to - carbon ratio which has been measured as function of energy @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . the ratio decreases as function of energy which is frequently explained in leaky box models by a rigidity - dependent = p / z$ ] . ] </S>",
    "<S> decrease of the path length of cosmic rays in the galaxy @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> typical values are @xmath15  g / cm@xmath5 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18  gv as reference rigidity .    </S>",
    "<S> cosmic - ray particles are assumed to propagate in a diffusive process through the galaxy , being deflected many times by the randomly oriented magnetic fields ( @xmath19  @xmath20 g ) . </S>",
    "<S> the nuclei are not confined to the galactic disc , they propagate in the galactic halo as well . </S>",
    "<S> the scale height of the halo has been estimated with measurements of the @xmath21be/@xmath22be - ratio by the isomax detector @xcite to be a few kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the abundance of radioactive nuclei in cosmic rays measured with the cris instrument yields a residence time in the galaxy of about @xmath23  years for particles with gev energies @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy density of cosmic rays amounts to about @xmath24  ev/@xmath25 , a value comparable to the energy density of the visible star light @xmath26  </S>",
    "<S> ev/@xmath25 , the galactic magnetic fields @xmath27  ev/@xmath25 , or the microwave background @xmath28  ev/@xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the power required to sustain a constant cosmic - ray intensity can be estimated as @xmath29  erg / s , where @xmath30 is the residence time of cosmic rays in a volume @xmath31 ( the galaxy and the galactic halo ) . with a rate of about three supernovae per century in a typical galaxy </S>",
    "<S> , the energy required could be provided by a small fraction ( @xmath32 ) of the kinetic energy released in supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> this had been realized already in 1934 by baade and zwicky @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the actual mechanism of acceleration remained mysterious until fermi @xcite proposed a process that involved interaction of particles with large - scale magnetic fields in the galaxy . eventually , this lead to the currently accepted model of cosmic - ray acceleration by the first - order fermi mechanism that operates in strong shock fronts which are powered by supernova explosions and propagate from a supernova remnant ( snr ) into the interstellar medium @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> diffusive , first - order shock acceleration works by virtue of the fact that particles gain an amount of energy @xmath33 at each cycle , where a cycle consists of a particle passing from the upstream ( unshocked ) region to the downstream region and back . at each cycle </S>",
    "<S> , there is a probability that the particle is lost downstream and does not return to the shock . </S>",
    "<S> higher energy particles are those that have remained longer in the vicinity of the shock and so have had time to achieve higher energy . after a time @xmath34 the maximum energy achieved is @xmath35 , where @xmath36 refers to the velocity of the shock . </S>",
    "<S> this results in an upper limit , assuming a minimal diffusion length equal to the larmor radius of a particle of charge @xmath37 in the magnetic fields @xmath38 behind and ahead of the shock . using typical values of type ii supernovae exploding in an average interstellar medium yields @xmath39ev </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recent estimates give a maximum energy up to one order of magnitude larger for some types of supernovae @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been suggested that the cosmic rays itself interact with the magnetic fields in the acceleration region , yielding to an amplification of the fields , which in turn results in much higher energies that can be reached during the acceleration process @xcite . with this </S>",
    "<S> mechanism cosmic rays are supposedly accelerated up to @xmath40  ev .    </S>",
    "<S> information on the composition at the source can be obtained from measurements of the abundance of refractory nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> they appear to have undergone minimal elemental fractionation relative to one another . comparing </S>",
    "<S> the derived abundance at the source to the abundance in the solar system reveals that the two samples exhibit a striking similarity over a wide range @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when uncertainties are taken into account , the abundances of particular isotopes are consistent with being within 20% of the solar values . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that cosmic rays are accelerated out of a sample of well mixed interstellar matter . </S>",
    "<S> hence , cosmic rays are `` regular '' matter , but accelerated to extremely high energies .    </S>",
    "<S> the understanding of the origin of the knee in the energy spectrum is commonly thought to be a cornerstone for the understanding of the origin of ( galactic ) cosmic rays . </S>",
    "<S> many approaches are discussed in the literature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a popular explanation is that the knee is associated with the upper limit of acceleration by galactic supernovae , while the ankle is associated with the onset of an extragalactic population that is less intense but has a harder spectrum that dominates at sufficiently high energy . </S>",
    "<S> another popular explanation is leakage of particles from the galaxy . at energies in the gev regime measurements </S>",
    "<S> indicate a decreasing path length of cosmic rays in the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> extrapolating this to higher energies indicates that above a certain energy cosmic rays are not contained in the galaxy ( or the galactic halo ) anymore . in a simple picture , </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood since the larmor radius of a proton in the galactic magnetic field @xmath41 becomes with increasing energy comparable to and finally exceeds the thickness of the galactic disk .    </S>",
    "<S> if the knee is caused by the maximum energy attained during the acceleration process or due to leakage from the galaxy the energy spectra for individual elements with charge @xmath42 would exhibit a cut - off ( or a knee ) at an energy @xmath43 , with the cut - off energy @xmath44 for protons . </S>",
    "<S> the sum of the flux of all elements with their individual cut - offs makes up the all - particle spectrum . in this picture </S>",
    "<S> the knee in the all - particle spectrum is related to the cut - off for protons and the steeper spectrum above the knee is a consequence of the subsequent cut - offs for all elements , resulting in a relatively smooth spectrum above the knee . since the abundance of ultra - heavy nuclei ( see ) at gev energies is very low as compared to iron the end of the galactic component is often assumed to be at energies around @xmath45 . however , recently it has been proposed that ultra - heavy elements may play an important role at high energies @xcite which yields a value of @xmath46 for the end of the galactic component , coinciding with the second knee at @xmath47ev .    </S>",
    "<S> another interesting question is that of a natural end of the spectrum at high energy . </S>",
    "<S> already 40 years ago it has been realized that interactions of cosmic rays with photons of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) would result in a cut - off of the spectrum above @xmath48  ev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all hadronic particles suffer significant energy losses during propagation above this energy . </S>",
    "<S> protons interact with background photons forming mainly a @xmath49 resonance @xcite and nuclei are broken up due to photodisintegration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a compilation of energy loss lengths of protons and various nuclei is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gzkplots ] ( ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the energy loss length of photons depends on the flux of the universal radio background ( urb ) which is not well known ( see , for example , discussion in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the assumptions on the urb , the energy loss length is significantly smaller than or comparable to that of hadronic particles .    </S>",
    "<S> s     the short energy loss lengths indicate that cosmic rays with energies above @xmath6ev should come from sources within a @xmath50mpc sphere . </S>",
    "<S> astrophysical sources within our galaxy are disfavored . </S>",
    "<S> even though rapidly spinning young neutron stars could be thought of accelerating particles to the highest energies observed @xcite , it would be difficult to explain the apparent isotropic arrival direction of uhecrs to energies beyond @xmath51  ev . as cosmic rays of energy greater than @xmath52ev </S>",
    "<S> are no longer confined by galactic magnetic fields , it is natural to assume that they are produced by extragalactic sources .    </S>",
    "<S> considering diffusive shock acceleration , which is thought to accelerate cosmic rays in snrs , the magnetic field strength @xmath38 in the source and the size @xmath53 of the source region are related to the maximum acceleration energy by @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the shock velocity in units of @xmath56 and @xmath42 is the particle charge . </S>",
    "<S> this relation is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gzkplots ] ( ) for various astrophysical objects . </S>",
    "<S> the list of the very few viable candidate sources includes active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite , radio lobes of fr ii galaxies @xcite , and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite ( for a review of astrophysical sources , see @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> many alternative , non - acceleration scenarios  called top - down models  have been proposed . in these models , </S>",
    "<S> uhecrs are produced in decays of super - heavy objects such as super - heavy dark matter @xcite , cryptons @xcite , or topological defects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all of these models postulate new particle physics and predict typically high gamma - ray fluxes at ultra - high energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally there are propagation model scenarios in which the gzk energy loss processes are evaded or shifted to higher energies . </S>",
    "<S> examples are violation of lorentz invariance @xcite , the @xmath42-burst model @xcite or postulation of new particles with properties similar to protons @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . reviews of the different scenarios can be found in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> measurements of the arrival direction distribution , primary mass composition and flux will be the key ingredients to solving the puzzle of uhecr sources . </S>",
    "<S> given an expected angular deflection of only a few degrees for particles above @xmath57ev in our galaxy @xcite and the existence of large cosmic voids with negligible magnetic fields @xcite , high statistics measurements should finally allow cosmic - ray astronomy and reveal correlations with sources or source regions . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , knowing the composition of uhecrs will restrict the classes of source models . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a mixed composition would exclude top - down models . </S>",
    "<S> another very important source of complementary information is given by secondary particle fluxes , i.e.  gamma - rays and neutrinos , produced in uhecrs sources and during propagation ( see , for example , @xcite ) .      in the following </S>",
    "<S> we will introduce some general properties of extensive air showers that are employed in cosmic - ray measurements . </S>",
    "<S> detailed presentations of this subject can be found in @xcite .      </S>",
    "<S> showers initiated by photons or electrons ( called em .  showers henceforth ) are governed mainly by the particle production processes ( i ) bremsstrahlung of electrons and ( ii ) pair production of electrons by photons . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to radiative energy losses , electrons are subject to ionization energy loss . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy loss @xmath58 of electrons can be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the ionization energy loss given by the bethe - bloch formula which depends logarithmically on energy . the _ radiation length _ , </S>",

    "<S> given the importance of the absolute energy assignment to a reconstructed shower we will summarize the current systematic uncertainties below .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy reconstruction of showers detected with the agasa array is based on the scintillator signal @xmath214 at 600 m from the shower core , where shower - to - shower fluctuations are the smallest and the relation between the signal and the primary energy is almost composition independent @xcite . the systematic error of energy assignment is analyzed in @xcite in detail , see also discussion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> agasa finds a total systematic uncertainty of the energy assignment of about @xmath215% . </S>",
    "<S> the main sources of uncertainty are related to shower phenomenology and the simulation of the relation of @xmath214 to the primary particle energy . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the observed discrepancy between the surface detector signal at 1000 m from the shower core and the fluorescence - based calorimetric energy measurement reported by auger @xcite indicates that currently available shower simulations do not allow to obtain an absolute energy scale with an systematic uncertainty smaller than @xmath21620% . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is not surprising that discrepancies between the experimentally observed attenuation length for @xmath214 and that expected from simulations hamper a re - analysis of the agasa data @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the shower energy determination applied in hires is based on the track length integral @xmath217 where @xmath218 is a fit to the shower profile using the gaisser - hillas function ( [ eq : gaisserhillas ] ) and @xmath219 denotes the mean ionization energy deposit @xcite . with hires being a fluorescence detector , the energy reconstruction is closely related to properties of the atmosphere which is serving as calorimeter . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , atmospheric properties also determine the aperture of the detector . </S>",
    "<S> the hires flux measurements ( hires i and hires ii mono ) are found to have similar systematic uncertainties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main contributions to the systematic uncertainty of the energy scale are the absolute calibration of the pmts ( @xmath220% ) , the limited knowledge of the air fluorescence yield ( @xmath221% ) , and atmospheric conditions ( @xmath222% ) . about @xmath220% uncertainty results from the rescaling of the measured calorimetric energy to obtain the total shower energy @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> see also . </S>",
    "<S> adding the individual contributions in quadrature , the overall systematic uncertainty of the energy reconstruction amounts to @xmath223% @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to surface arrays , the aperture of fluorescence detectors has to be determined by simulations . </S>",
    "<S> sources of uncertainty are here varying atmospheric conditions , simulation of shower profiles and detector trigger thresholds , and the primary cosmic ray composition . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainty due to varying atmospheric conditions , mainly that of the vertical aerosol optical depth ( vaod ) , has been estimated to contribute to the aperture uncertainty @xmath224% @xcite . in a recent study </S>",
    "<S> the other , simulation - related sources of uncertainty were found not to contribute significantly to the overall flux uncertainty of @xmath225% @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> the transition energy @xmath364 approximately coincides with the position of the second knee @xmath365 observed in the all - particle spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the critical energy @xmath69 is determined by the energy @xmath366  ev , where adiabatic and pair - production energy losses are equal . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the position of the second knee is explained in this scenario by proton energy losses on cosmic microwave background photons . </S>",
    "<S> the extragalactic component required in the poly - gonato model is somewhere between scenarios 1 and 2 shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ polygonato ] ( ) . </S>",
    "<S> it should be emphasized that the pair production mechanism requires the primary particles to be dominated ( @xmath367 ) by protons @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> traditionally , the ankle is interpreted as the characteristic signature for the transition between galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in such a scenario , extragalactic cosmic rays dominate the flux above about @xmath51ev . </S>",
    "<S> this picture of the transition to extragalactic cosmic rays is supported by the pioneering observations of the fly s eye experiment that the composition changes at about @xmath208ev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> new observations by hires - mia and hires find a rather sharp transition from a heavy to a light composition at much lower energy , @xmath368ev . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the hires data are difficult to understand within a model in which naturally heavy elements should dominate the end of the spectrum of galactic cosmic rays just below @xmath51ev .    </S>",
    "<S> if one assumes that extragalactic cosmic rays are accelerated in processes qualitatively similar to those in our galaxy then , at injection , the composition of extragalactic cosmic rays should be similar to that of cosmic rays at lower energy . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , model calculations show that a mixed or even predominantly heavy source composition could , after taking propagation effects into account , be compatible with existing data @xcite .    on the other hand , the model by berezinsky _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ predicts a proton - dominated composition at energies as low as @xmath52ev . </S>",
    "<S> one of the advantages of this model is the natural explanation of the energy and the shape of the ankle . to obtain a good description of the ankle , there should not be more than @xmath369% he in the extragalactic cosmic - ray flux @xcite . this could be interpreted as indication for either strong magnetic fields in the accelerating shock fronts or top - down source scenarios , which predict proton - dominated fluxes at not too high an energy .    </S>",
    "<S> understanding the nature of the ankle in the cosmic - ray spectrum has direct implications on the spectrum at much higher energy . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if the @xmath370 pair production model is confirmed one can conclude that ( i ) extragalactic cosmic rays are mainly protons , ( ii ) sources are cosmologically distributed , ( iii ) there should be a gzk suppression of the flux , ( iv ) an arrival direction correlation with local sources can be expected , and ( v ) the injection spectrum of extragalactic cosmic rays is rather steep ( @xmath371 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> finally it should be noted that the neutrino flux contains complementary information for distinguishing between different model scenarios for the ankle @xcite .      </S>",
    "<S> many authors assume extragalactic particles to be nuclei of intermediate to light mass . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy of elemental compositions derived from mean depth of shower maximum and electron / muon number measurements , however , makes it impossible to use currently available composition measurements as reliable criteria to disfavor models ( see also discussion in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is most strikingly seen in the prototype hires - mia measurements @xcite . whereas the mean depth of maximum data clearly showed the transition to a proton - dominated composition ( qgsjet - based interpretation ) </S>",
    "<S> , the muon density at 600 m  of the same showers  appeared to correspond to primaries as heavy or even heavier than iron . </S>",
    "<S> a pure iron composition is obviously not compatible with data . </S>",
    "<S> the rather wide distribution of @xmath372 can not be described with iron primaries only .    </S>",
    "<S> the measurements of the hires experiment and the pierre auger observatory have given evidence for a suppression of the flux at energies exceeding @xmath289  ev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the question arises whether this steepening is due to the gzk effect , due to the maximum energy achieved during the acceleration processes , or due to both , a gzk energy loss process and an upper energy limit in the sources .    </S>",
    "<S> the support for the existence of the gzk effect is provided by the correlation of the arrival directions with agn , which imply a strong anisotropy of the arrival direction distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy appears sharply at an energy of 57  eev . at this energy , the flux measured by </S>",
    "<S> the pierre auger observatory is about 50% lower than expected from a power law extrapolation from lower energies . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there seems to be a connection between the steepening in the spectrum and the agn correlation . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the observed suppression is due to the gzk effect one would expect either a light or rather heavy elemental composition above the gzk threshold . </S>",
    "<S> intermediate mass nuclei are expected to break up very rapidly in interactions with the photons of the 3-k microwave background . </S>",
    "<S> the relative abundance of secondary protons produced during propagation according to a recent model @xcite is displayed in  ( ) . observations of the average depth of the shower maximum at the highest energies indicate a mixed composition , see e.g.  .         the expected flux at earth according to a propagation model of highest energy cosmic rays by allard et al .  @xcite is presented in ( ) . </S>",
    "<S> in this article different scenarios for the properties of the sources are discussed , like different elemental compositions and different spectral indices for the energy spectra at the sources . </S>",
    "<S> shows the result assuming a mixed elemental composition at the sources . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions of individual elemental groups to the all - particle spectrum are shown . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the energy spectrum measured by the pierre auger observatory is well represented by the all - particle spectrum derived from the model .    </S>",
    "<S> another important source of information are fluxes of particles produced during the propagation of cosmic rays in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> fluxes of neutrinos and gamma - rays due to the interaction of ultra high - energy cosmic rays with the background photon radiation provide complementary information for discriminating models of uhecrs @xcite . in measured upper limits for the neutrino flux </S>",
    "<S> have been compared to a top - down model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latest auger data disfavor this model .    photons of ultra high energy are easier to detect but their energy loss distance is very short . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless the measurement of the photon fraction in the primary cosmic - ray flux is one of the most promising methods of distinguishing between different source scenarios of extragalactic cosmic rays @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent experimental upper limits strongly disfavor predictions of top - down models @xcite , see ( ) . due to the down - cascading of photons in the extragalactic radiation background , </S>",
    "<S> fluxes of gev photons are also a complementary source of information . </S>",
    "<S> for example , neutrino and photon fluxes of a z - burst model are discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both , the neutrino flux limit by the forte satellite @xcite and the egret diffuse extragalactic photon flux analysis @xcite severely constrain this model . recently , also even more stringent limits were set by the anita experiment @xcite , ruling out most of the parameter space of the z - burst model . in summary </S>",
    "<S> , top - down models are disfavored by recent experimental results of various experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the key questions in the field of high - energy astroparticle physics is the understanding of the observed anisotropy above the gzk energy threshold .    the angular scale of about @xmath192 would favour protons if the agns within this correlation angle are indeed the sources of uhecrs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this would be at variance with the auger data on the mean depths of shower maximum . </S>",
    "<S> most likely , the agn correlation has to be interpreted merely as a signature of anisotropy and correlation with the nearby matter distribution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , the rate of misidentification of a potential source along the line of sight of the arrival direction of a cosmic ray is very large . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the agns within the correlation window are found to be often less powerful seyfert 2 galaxies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , the agns in our cosmological neighborhood are strongly clustered , making it difficult to distinguish between a true agn correlation and a correlation with larger scale structures .    instead of assuming a single source in each of the directions of the measured uhecrs </S>",
    "<S> , one can assign most of the arrival directions to about three sources or source regions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this model scenario would require rather weak galactic magnetic fields and particles in the mass range up to carbon .    in all anisotropy studies even at the highest energies , the galactic magnetic fields play a central role @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> knowing their structure to sufficient detail would , for example , allow the determination of the charge of uhecrs . </S>",
    "<S> other interesting applications are the search for the cosmological compton - getting effect , a 0.6% dipole anisotropy that is expected for cosmological sources @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a much higher number of uhecrs has to be collected for detailed anisotropy studies of the required sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> if uhecrs are confirmed to be protons , the data can be used for proton astronomy including studies of energy spectra of individual sources and magnetic field spectroscopy , e.g.  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this will , of course , require very large - aperture installations as the relevant energy range is just in the gzk suppression region .    </S>",
    "<S> there are strong indications for shortcomings in the shower simulations , probably due to limitations of modeling hadronic interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> detailed studies of the shower development in the atmosphere have been performed with the kascade multi - detector set - up and interaction models have been improved @xcite . a particularly valuable tool to test high - energy interaction models are correlations between different shower components @xcite . some years ago </S>",
    "<S> several models like sibyll1.6 , dpmjet2.5 , or nexus2 failed to describe the measurements of particular correlations . on the other hand , for modern models like qgsjet01 , sibyll2.1 , or dpmjet  2.55 , </S>",
    "<S> the kascade measurements are compatible with predictions for various correlations between the electromagnetic , muonic , and hadronic components , i.e.  the measurements are bracketed by the extreme assumptions of primary protons and iron nuclei @xcite . in previous analyses pure proton or iron compositions have been assumed as extreme cases . </S>",
    "<S> however , at present , more detailed analyses are performed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they take into account the spectra for elemental groups as obtained from investigations of the electromagnetic and muonic components ( as discussed above , see ) . </S>",
    "<S> these investigations reveal deviations between measurements and simulations for the hadronic component of the order of 10% to 20% @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the situation is similar at very high energy . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the mean @xmath266 of the hires - mia data is not consistent with the measured muon densities of the same events @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the conclusions on mass composition from haverah park data are different if the time structure of the shower front is used instead of the muon yield that determines the rate of inclined showers . </S>",
    "<S> the auger data indicate that the energy scale derived from surface detector simulation seems to be of the order of 25% higher than that obtained from fluorescence measurements @xcite .         in the foreseeable future soft multi - particle production will not be calculable within qcd . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the modeling of cosmic - ray interactions will continue to depend strongly on the input from accelerator experiments that is needed to tune phenomenological particle production models . </S>",
    "<S> measurements at both , fixed target and collider experiments can substantially contribute to reducing the uncertainties of the models and , hence , determine the composition of cosmic rays .    </S>",
    "<S> high - energy interactions are very important for the overall shower profile but hadronic multiparticle production is least known in this energy range . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : modelslhc ] in which predictions of hadronic interaction models are shown for proton - proton collisions at @xmath373tev . </S>",
    "<S> the acceptance ranges for different detector components of the cern cms @xcite detector for the lhc @xcite are also shown .    </S>",
    "<S> every ultra high - energy air shower contains many sub - showers of lower energy . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the slope of the lateral distribution of particles in a shower is a measure of the mass of the primary particle . even for high - energy showers of @xmath51ev , </S>",
    "<S> this slope is very sensitive to assumptions on hadronic multiparticle production in the energy range of ten to a few hundred gev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the energy distribution of hadronic interactions , in which at least one meson was produced that in turn decayed to a muon that reached sea level , has a maximum in the range between 80 and 200 gev . </S>",
    "<S> most of the interactions are induced by pions ( 70% ) and nucleons ( 20% ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to accelerator measurements of hadronic multiparticle production @xcite , measurements and understanding of air shower data at lower energy are very important to tune and validate the used hadronic interaction models @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the all - particle flux of cosmic rays is reasonably well known up to the highest energies . </S>",
    "<S> recent measurements by the hires and auger collaborations established a gzk - like suppression of the flux at energies exceeding @xmath374  ev .    in the knee region the mean mass of cosmic rays is found to increase as function of energy . </S>",
    "<S> the knee is caused by sequential breaks in the spectra of individual elements , starting with the light elements . at present , a rigidity dependence of the cut - off energies for the individual elements is likely but not yet clear beyond doubt . above @xmath40  ev </S>",
    "<S> the situation becomes very uncertain . </S>",
    "<S> almost no data are available in the important energy range where the galactic cosmic - ray component is expected to end ( @xmath375  ev ) , at present there are only limited experimental efforts in this region . at the highest energies ( @xmath376  ev ) , </S>",
    "<S> several experiments indicate a light to mixed composition with a strong dependence on the model used to describe high - energy interactions in the atmosphere .    </S>",
    "<S> large scale anisotropies have been found at low energies , being compatible with the movement of the earth around the sun ( compton getting effect ) . in the knee region , </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropies disappear , indicating that the rest frame of galactic cosmic rays co - rotates with the galaxy . at ultra - high energies anisotropy measurements </S>",
    "<S> provide independent information on the composition due to deflections in the galactic magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the pierre auger observatory indicate a correlation between the arrival direction of cosmic rays and the super galactic plane .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy of the transition from galactic to extragalactic particles is discussed controversially . </S>",
    "<S> the scenarios considered limit the transition energy to the range between @xmath40 and @xmath51  ev . </S>",
    "<S> precise composition measurements in this region will be decisive .    </S>",
    "<S> the knowledge about the cosmic - ray composition is presently limited by the uncertainties in the hadronic interaction models used to describe the air shower development . </S>",
    "<S> the ambiguities can not be resolved by cosmic - ray measurements solely . </S>",
    "<S> collaboration with experiments at the lhc and fixed target experiments is mandatory to improve the understanding of multiparticle production in the ( extreme ) forward region , thus providing reliable simulation codes .    </S>",
    "<S> independent and complementary information about the origin of high - energy cosmic rays can be obtained by measurements of high - energy gamma rays and neutrinos ( multi messenger approach ) . </S>",
    "<S> recent measurements of tev gamma rays from supernova remnants give strong hints for this object class as sources of galactic cosmic rays . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of neutrino and photon fluxes are very useful to distinguish between different scenarios for the transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays . </S>",
    "<S> they are important to establish a gzk feature beyond doubt and provide composition information at the highest energies .    </S>",
    "<S> in the near future new cosmic - ray detectors will provide additional information on the transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays ( kascade - grande @xcite , icetop / icecube @xcite , extensions of auger - south @xcite , extension of the telescope array @xcite ) , the anisotropy of the arrival directions and composition of cosmic rays at the highest energies on the whole sky ( auger north @xcite ) as well as super gzk particles ( euso @xcite , a recovery of the cosmic - ray flux beyond the gzk resonance ) . </S>",
    "<S> a promising new detection technique , the measurement of radio emission from air showers , is presently developed in the pierre auger observatory and the lofar project . </S>",
    "<S> this technique is expected to allow efficient cosmic - ray measurements in future large - aperture experiments .    in foreseeable future </S>",
    "<S> no significant improvement of hadronic interaction models is expected . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the range of direct measurements should be extended to energies approaching the knee . </S>",
    "<S> ideal would be an access - type @xcite experiment in outer space with exposure times of several years . </S>",
    "<S> more experimental efforts are needed in the energy region where the galactic component is expected to end . at ultra - high energies </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy studies are limited by statistics only . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , large aperture experiments are needed with full - sky coverage such as the pierre auger project ( with observatories in the southern and northern hemisphere ) . </S>"
