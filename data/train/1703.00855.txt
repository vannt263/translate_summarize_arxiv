    "for any thermal heat engines and thermodynamic cycles the three main criteria are central : the produced maximal work , the efficiency , and the output power of the engine .",
    "the high efficiency of the heat engine is important for performing operations with low energy consumption , while the amount of the produced work and the power of the heat machine are crucial for swift performance .",
    "is it realistic to meet all those three criteria simultaneously ? .",
    "the present work addresses this question and provides a brief overview on the current status of knowledge .",
    "+ to introduce the problem and notations we start by recalling the basics of the classical thermodynamics @xcite . for a thermally isolated system consisting of two parts which are not in thermal equilibrium",
    ", a certain work is performed on the surrounding bodies during the transition to the equilibrium state .",
    "we exclude the work associated with the general expansion , assuming that the total volume of the system is conserved .",
    "then the produced work is a function of the internal energy of the system @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the initial energy .",
    "since the transition to the equilibrium state might occur in a variety of ways the final energy and the entropy @xmath2 might be different .",
    "considering the produced work as a functional of the system s entropy we write @xmath3 . as @xmath4 is always negative ( we use the absolute temperature scale @xmath5 ) , any increment in the entropy while producing the work lowers work .",
    "hence , the maximal work @xmath6 is produced during the process when the entropy of the system stays constant @xmath7 .",
    "more rigorous deliberation leads to the following formula for the maximal work @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 stand for the temperature and the pressure of the environment , while @xmath10 define the internal energy , the entropy , and the volume of the working body .",
    "if the volume and the temperature are constant during the process , the produced maximal work is equal to the change in the free energy @xmath11 .",
    "note , the adiabaticity of the process excludes any direct energy exchange between the bodies with the different temperatures .",
    "the ideal heat engine envisioned by carnot has four strokes : the working substance at temperature @xmath12 absorbs isothermally energy from the hot heat bath , and then is cooled down adiabatically to the temperature @xmath13 .",
    "thereafter , the working substance releases isothermally energy to a cold heat bath at @xmath13 , and eventually returns adiabatically to the initial state .",
    "two thermal baths with temperatures @xmath14 are needed to perform a reversible cycle .",
    "the existence of two heat baths allows excluding a direct irreversible energy exchange between the systems with different temperatures .",
    "the efficiency and the produced work of the ideal heat engine read : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the heat absorbed from the hot bath .",
    "the adiabaticity imposes certain restrictions on the cycle s swiftness .",
    "an ideal cycle takes an infinite time @xmath18 , and therefore the output power of the ideal carnot cycle vanishes @xmath19 .",
    "so it is of relevance to find ways yielding a good cycle efficiency with a reasonable power .",
    "this issue is not only a technical but also it is a conceptual one , even for classical systems . for quantum heat engines additional aspects are important .",
    "when the size of the working medium is scaled down to the mesoscopic scale purely quantum effects such as quantum fluctuations and interlevel transitions become important .",
    "the problem of the thermally assisted interlevel transitions can be solved relatively easily by detaching the working body from the heat bath .",
    "+ quantum adiabaticity is more subtle . to be precise",
    "we specify the concept of adiabaticity separately for quantum and classical systems .",
    "the stroke of the cycle , which is adiabatic in the sense of classical thermodynamics may be nonadiabatic for a quantum working substance .",
    "the reason lies in quantum interlevel transitions that naturaly occur in the case of fast driving and a finite time thermodynamic cycles .",
    "thus , quantum adiabaticity implies not only a decoupling of the system from the thermal source , but also requires an elimination of interlevel transitions that are of a pure quantum nature .",
    "shortcuts to quantum adiabaticity is a recent theoretical concept that allows eliminating the effect of those interlevel transitions @xcite . in what follows",
    "we provide a brief introduction to shortcuts to quantum adiabaticity . before that we discuss the efficiency of the carnot engine at maximum output power for a classical system @xcite .",
    "an ideal carnot engine assumes that during isothermal strokes the working substance is in equilibrium with the thermal reservoirs , meaning that the isothermal strokes are performed infinitely slowly .",
    "therefore , the power output of the engine is zero , since the finite work is produced in an infinite time .",
    "ref.@xcite assumes that during the isothermal expansion the heat flux through the vessel enfolding the working medium is proportional to the temperature gradient across the vessel .",
    "therefore , the expressions for the absorbed heat and the heat rejected to the heat sink read @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 are constants , @xmath22 are the durations of the isothermal strokes , and @xmath23 are the temperatures of the working medium during the isothermal strokes .",
    "the key issue in this assumption is that the duration of the isothermal strokes are finite .",
    "however , the cycle is reversible and the total entropy production is zero @xmath24 .",
    "the output power of the cycle is @xmath25 and the total time spent for the two adiabatic strokes is @xmath26 . with this expressions",
    "one can maximize the power output @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "after a little algebra for the cycle efficiency and the maximum output power one obtains : @xmath29 .",
    "note a finite time cycle needed for the maximal power output comes at the cost of a lower efficiency @xmath30 .",
    "unfortunately , the results obtained in ref.@xcite are not directly applicable to quantum heat engines since in the quantum case pure quantum interlevel transitions may lift the adiabaticity .",
    "adiabatic shortcuts are thus needed .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy of a system is equal to the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system .",
    "this is a very general formulation applicable to quantum systems as well .",
    "however , for quantum systems the definitions of a quantum heat and a quantum work need to be revisited@xcite .    at nonzero temperature the energy of a system",
    "can be evaluated as follows @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the hamiltonian of the system and @xmath33 is the density matrix . for the change in the internal energy we deduce : @xmath34 .",
    "the first term @xmath35 corresponds to the heat exchange and is related to the change of the level populations @xmath36 occurring due to a change in the temperature @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "the second term @xmath39 corresponds to the produced work .",
    "the working substance produces work due to a change in the energy spectrum @xmath40 of the system .",
    "the relation of heat exchange and the quantum level populations is clear .",
    "the concept of a quantum work needs however further specification @xcite .",
    "let us consider a thermally isolated classical system @xmath41 driven by an external parameter @xmath42 .",
    "a change in the parameter @xmath43 produces work delivered to the system .",
    "this work is assumed to be small compared to the energy of the system . at @xmath44",
    "the system is thermalized to a temperature @xmath45 .",
    "the work done on the system reads@xcite @xmath46 the work averaged over the statistical ensemble is @xmath47 according to the bochkov - kuzovlev equalities , not the work @xmath48 itself , but the exponential of the work @xmath49 is the key point : @xmath50\\exp\\big[-\\beta(h_{f}-h_{0})\\big]d\\gamma_{0}.\\ ] ] here @xmath51 $ ] is the distribution function of the equilibrated system at @xmath44 , @xmath52 is the free energy , and @xmath53 is the phase volume of the system . due to the liouville theorem",
    "the phase volume of the system is invariant @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , one writes @xmath55 finally we obtain the expression @xmath56 , where @xmath57 .",
    "this equality for cyclic process @xmath58 was obtained by bochkov and kuzovlev in 1977 and by jarzynski in 1997 for a more general setting @xmath59 .    according to statistical physics , for an adiabatic process when the parameter @xmath42 changes slowly compared to the system s relaxation time , the produced work is equal to the change in free energy @xmath60 . for the non - adiabatic case @xmath61 part of the work",
    "is wasted on the entropy production .",
    "the nonequilibrium entropy associated with the nonadiabatic process is defined as @xmath62 .",
    "here @xmath63 is the difference between the delivered work in the nonadiabatic process and the change in free energy .",
    "we can rewrite jarzynski equality in the following form ( cf .",
    "ref.@xcite ) : @xmath64 . using the ansatz for the work fluctuations @xmath65 we obtain @xmath66 .",
    "noteably , the work for a quantum system is not an observable .",
    "this means that the average of the total work performed on the system does nt corresponds to the expectation values of an operator representing the work @xcite .",
    "in particular the work delivered to a quantum system is related to the time ordered correlation functions of the exponentiated hamiltonian .",
    "the nonequilibrium entropy associated with a nonadiabatic process can be calculated straightforwardly @xcite .",
    "first we define the probability distribution of the quantum work @xmath67 here @xmath68 is the initial thermal gibbs distribution , @xmath69 is the partition function , @xmath70 are the initial energies , and @xmath71 are the transition probabilities . using @xmath72 one can calculate the non - equilibrium quantum work : @xmath73 @xmath74 is the final equilibrium distribution function . in the absence of purely quantum inter - level transitions",
    "@xmath75 the first two terms disappear and the quantum work becomes equal to the change in free energy .",
    "for a general discussion of shortcuts to adiabaticity and an overview of the interrelation between the various approaches as well as their historical developments we refer to the review article @xcite and references therein . here",
    "we will basically follow berry s transitionless driving formulation@xcite which is equivalent to the counterdiabatic approach of demirplak and rice @xcite .",
    "let us suppose that the hamiltonian of the system has the form @xmath76 . here",
    "@xmath77 are canonical coordinates and @xmath42 is a parameter in the sense discussed above . for the solution of schrdinger equation @xmath78 we implement the following ansatz : @xmath79 where @xmath80 are the instantaneous quasi - energies that depend adiabatically on the parameter @xmath42 .",
    "after standard derivations for the time dependent coefficients @xmath81 we obtain the iterative solution @xmath82 the adiabatic approximation is valid when the following criteria hold @xmath83 here @xmath84 is a second order correction to @xmath81 .",
    "if the characteristic time scale of the parameter @xmath42 is @xmath85 and @xmath86 then the dynamic of the system is adiabatic and the effect of the non - adiabaticity is exponentially small .    in the case of an adiabatic evolution",

    "we construct the auxiliary ( counter - diabatic ) hamiltonian @xmath92 the reverse state engineering relies on the requirement that the states ( [ states ] ) solve for the hamiltonian ( [ auxiliary hamiltonian ] ) , meaning that @xmath93 in this way even for a fast driving the transitions between the eigenstates @xmath94 are prevented . after a relatively simple algebra the counter - diabatic ( cd ) hamiltonian @xmath95 takes the form @xmath96 where @xmath97 we adopt the initial conditions for the driving protocol as @xmath98 thus , on the time interval",
    "@xmath99 $ ] we achieve a fast adiabatic dynamic by means of the counter - diabatic hamiltonian @xmath95",
    ".    this result can be straightforwardly generalized to systems with a degenerated spectrum @xcite . in this case",
    "we have @xmath100 here we assumed that the eigenvalue @xmath101 is @xmath102 times degenerated and @xmath103 are the corresponding degenerated eigenfunctions @xmath104 .",
