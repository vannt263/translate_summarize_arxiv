    "electroencephalogram ( eeg ) signals are the most widely used input for brain - computer interfaces ( bcis ) @xcite , mainly due to the convenience to obtain them , compared with magnetoencephalography ( meg ) @xcite , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) @xcite , functional near - infrared spectroscopy ( fnirs ) @xcite , and invasive signals like electrocorticography ( ecog ) @xcite and intracortical neural recordings @xcite . however , eeg signals are often contaminated by ocular , muscular , and cardiac artifacts and various noises ( power - line , changes in electrode impedances , etc ) @xcite .",
    "usually some preprocessing , either manually or automatically @xcite , is needed to remove the artifacts , and then temporal and spatial filters are applied to further improve the eeg signal quality before feeding it into a classification or regression algorithm .",
    "the most commonly used temporal filters are band - pass filters and notch filters ( at 50 or 60 hz power - line frequency ) .",
    "this paper focuses on spatial filtering for improving the eeg signal quality .",
    "many such approaches have been proposed in the literature @xcite . however , almost all of them focus primarily on eeg classification problems in bci , whereas eeg regression problems have been largely overlooked . nevertheless , the latter is also very important in bci .",
    "one example is driver drowsiness ( or alertness ) estimation from eeg signals , which has been extensively studied in our previous research @xcite .",
    "this is a very important problem because drowsy driving is among the most important causes of road crashes , following only to alcohol , speeding , and inattention @xcite .",
    "according to the national highway traffic safety administration @xcite , 2.5% of fatal motor vehicle crashes ( on average 886/year in the u.s . ) and 2.5% of fatalities ( on average 1,004/year in the u.s . ) between 2005 and 2009 involved drowsy driving .",
    "this paper proposes two spatial filters for eeg - based regression problems in bci .",
    "we also validate their performance in response speed ( rs ) estimation from eeg signals measured in a large - scale sustained - attention psychomotor vigilance task ( pvt ) @xcite , which collected 143 sessions of data from 17 subjects in a 5-month period .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : section  [ sect : review ] reviews the state - of - the - art spatial filters for eeg - based classification problems in bci .",

    "ica assumes that @xmath6 is the linear combination of @xmath7 independent sources , i.e. , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the _ mixing matrix _ , and the source signals , which are the rows of @xmath10 , are supposed to be stationary , independent , and non - gaussian .",
    "ica can use various different principles @xcite to estimate both unknown @xmath11 and unknown @xmath12 simultaneously from @xmath6 . once @xmath12 is obtained , cleaner and more representative features may be extracted from it than from the original @xmath6 @xcite .",

    "in this section we propose two common spatial pattern for regression ( cspr ) filters , which extend the multi - class csp filters from classification to regression by making use of fuzzy sets @xcite , as we have done in @xcite .",
    "first , a brief introduction of fuzzy sets is given below .",
    "a fuzzy set @xmath54 is comprised of a _ universe of discourse _",

    "observe that this is different from traditional ( binary ) sets , where each element can only belong to a set completely ( i.e. , with membership degree 1 ) , or does not belong to it at all ( i.e. , with membership degree 0 ) ; there is nothing in between ( i.e. , with membership degree 0.5 ) .",
    "fuzzy sets are frequently used in modeling concepts in natural language @xcite , which may not have clear boundaries .",
    "let @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) be the @xmath29th eeg trial , where @xmath4 is the number of channels and @xmath31 is the number of time samples in each trial .",
    "we assume that the mean of each channel measurement has been removed , which is usually performed by band - pass filtering .",
    "let @xmath68 be the rs of @xmath24 .    with the help of fuzzy sets",
    ", we can define  fuzzy \" classes to connect regression problems and classification problems .",
    "assume @xmath46 fuzzy classes are used .",
    "first , we partition the interval @xmath69 $ ] into @xmath70 equal intervals , and denote the partition points as @xmath71 .",
    "it is easy to obtain that @xmath72 for each @xmath73 , we then find the corresponding @xmath73 percentile value of all training @xmath74 and denote it as @xmath75 .",
    "next we define @xmath46 fuzzy classes from them , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fss ] . in this way",
    ", we can  classify \" the training @xmath74 into @xmath46 fuzzy classes , corresponding to the @xmath46 crisp classes in the csp for classification .",
    "however , note that in the csp for classification a @xmath74 belongs to a crisp class either completely or not at all . for a fuzzy class here",
    ", a @xmath74 can belong to it at a membership degree in @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "fuzzy classes for @xmath74 , when triangular fuzzy sets are used.,width=302 ]    next , for each fuzzy class , we compute its mean eeg trial as : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the membership degree of @xmath74 in fuzzy class @xmath0 .",
    "substituting ( [ eq : fp0 ] ) into ( [ eq : csp ] ) , we can solve for the spatial filtering matrix @xmath51 for fuzzy class @xmath0 .",
    "essentially , this @xmath51 makes those @xmath24 in fuzzy class @xmath0 different from those not in fuzzy class @xmath0 , which will help the regression performance , as we will demonstrate in section  [ sect : results ] .",
    "next , we construct the concatenated spatial filtering matrix @xmath22 by ( [ eq : w ] ) , and finally perform the spatial filtering for each eeg trial @xmath24 by ( [ eq : xi ] ) . the complete cspr - ovr spatial filter for",

    "the only difference is that @xmath51 is computed by ( [ eq : csp2 ] ) instead of ( [ eq : csp ] ) .",
    "this section introduces a pvt experiment that was used to evaluate the performances of the proposed spatial filtering algorithms , the corresponding rs and eeg data preprocessing procedures , and the feature sets .",
    "17 university students ( 13 males ; average age 22.4 , standard deviation 1.6 ) from national chiao tung university ( nctu ) in taiwan volunteered to support the data - collection efforts over a 5-month period to study eeg correlates of attention and performance changes under specific conditions of real - world fatigue @xcite , as determined by the effectiveness score of readiband @xcite . the voluntary , fully informed consent of the persons used in this research was obtained as required by federal and army regulations @xcite .",
    "the institutional review board of nctu approved the experimental protocol .",
    "all participants registered their fatigue levels through a smartphone daily , and received notifications to report for experimental trials when the effectiveness score deemed their conditions fitted the experimental requirement ( low fatigue : @xmath83 ; normal : @xmath84 $ ] ; high fatigue : @xmath85 ) . upon completion of the related questionnaires [ karolinska sleepiness scale ( kss ) @xcite , and electronically - adapted visual analog scale for fatigue ( vas - f ) and stress ( vas - s ) ] and the informed consent form , subjects performed a pvt , a dynamic attention - shifting task , a lane - keeping task , and selected surveys ( kss , vas - f , vas - s , state - trait anxiety inventory , and mind - wandering ) preceding each condition .",
    "eeg data were recorded at 1000 hz using a 64-channel neuroscan system .",
    "most participants performed the laboratory experiment thrice in each of the three fatigue states .",
    "in this paper we focus on the pvt @xcite , which is a sustained - attention task that uses rs to measure the speed with which a subject responds to a visual stimulus .",
    "it is widely used , particularly by nasa , for its ease of scoring , simple metrics , convergent validity , and free of learning effects . in our experiment ,",
    "the pvt was presented on a smartphone with each trial initiated as an empty solid white circle centered on the touchscreen that began to fill in red displayed as a clockwise sweeping motion like the hand of a clock .",
    "the sweeping motion was programmed to turn solid red in one second or terminate upon a response by the participants , which required them to tap the touchscreen with the thumb of their dominant hand .",
    "the rs was computed as the inverse of the elapsed time between the appearance of the empty solid white circle and the participant s response .",
    "following completion of each trial , the circle went back to solid white until the next trial .",
    "inter - trial intervals consisted of random intervals between 2 - 10 seconds .",
    "143 sessions of pvt data were collected from the 17 subjects , and each session lasted 10 minutes .",
    "our goal is to predict the rs using a 3-second eeg trial immediately before it .",
    "the following procedure was performed to evaluate the performances of different spatial filters :    1 .",
    "eeg data preprocessing to suppress artifacts and noises .",
    "2 .   rs data preprocessing to suppress outliers .",
    "5-fold cross - validation to compute the regression performance for each combination of spatial filters and regression method : first randomly partition the trials into five equal folds ; then , use four folds for supervised spatial filtering and regression model training , and the remaining fold for testing ; repeat this five times so that every fold is used in testing ; finally compute the regression performances in terms of root mean square error ( rmse ) and correlation coefficient ( cc ) .",
    "two regression methods were used : lasso , whose adjustable parameter @xmath86 was optimized by an inner 5-fold cross - validation on the training dataset , and @xmath0-nearest neighbors ( knn ) regression , where @xmath87 .",

    "each trial was then individually filtered by a @xmath91 $ ] hz finite impulse response band - pass filter to make each channel zero - mean and to remove un - useful high frequency components .",
    "because the inter - trial intervals consisted of random intervals between 2 - 10 seconds , it s possible that a 3-second eeg trial covers part of data from the previous trial",
    ". additionally , a trial may also contain the eeg oscillations related to motor reaction ( tapping the touchscreen ) in the previous trial . to remedy these problems , we removed overlapping trials :",
    "let the rs of the @xmath29th trial be @xmath74 ( the corresponding response time is @xmath92 ) ; then , the @xmath29th trial is removed if @xmath93 , i.e. , when the 3-second eeg data for trial @xmath29 overlap with the data and response for the previous trial .",
    "the raw response times for two subjects are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rts ] .",
    "the top panel is from a typical subject , whose response times were mostly shorter than 1 second .",
    "the lower panel is from a subject with possible data recording issues , because lots of response times were longer than 5 seconds , which are highly unlikely in practice .",
    "so we excluded that subject from consideration in this paper , and only used the remaining 16 subjects .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rts ] , the response times were very noisy , and there were obvious outliers .",
    "it is very important to suppress the outliers and noises so that the performances of different algorithms can be more accurately compared .",
    "in addition to the step in the previous subsection to remove overlapping trials , we also employed the following 2-step procedure for response time preprocessing :    1 .",
    "_ outlier thresholding _ , which aimed to suppress abnormally large response times .",
    "first , a threshold @xmath94 was computed for each subject , where @xmath95 is the mean response time from all sessions of that subject , and @xmath96 is the corresponding standard deviation .",
    "then , all response times larger than @xmath97 were replaced by @xmath97 .",
    "note that the threshold was different for different subjects .",
    "_ moving average smoothing _ , which replaced each response time by the average response time during a 60 seconds moving window centered at the onset of the corresponding pvt to suppress noises .",
    "we then computed the rs as the inverse of the rt .",
    "the rss for the 16 subjects are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rss ] . observe that they are roughly in the same range , and many of them are approximately gaussian .",
    "we extracted the following four feature sets for each preprocessed eeg trial :    * ` raw ` : _ theta and alpha powerband features from the band - pass filtered eeg trials .",
    "_ we computed the average power spectral density ( psd ) in the theta band ( 4 - 8 hz ) and alpha band ( 8 - 13 hz ) for each channel using welch s method @xcite , and converted these @xmath98 band powers to dbs as our features . * ` car ` : _ theta and alpha powerband features from eeg trials filtered by car .",
    "_ this procedure was almost identical to ` raw ` , except that the band - pass filtered eeg trials were also spatially filtered by car before the @xmath98 powerband features were computed .",
    "car is one of the most commonly used spatial filters for eeg , and @xcite showed that it helped improve eeg classification performance .",

    "we then tested their performances on the corrupted testing data .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : noises ] .",
    "generally , as the noise level increased , the performances decreased , which is intuitive .",
    "however , ` ovr ` and ` ova ` achieved better rmses and ccs than ` raw ` and ` car ` at almost all noise levels , suggesting that it is still beneficial to use cspr - ovr and cspr - ova even under high attribute noise .",
    "observe from algorithm  1 that in training cspr - ovr needs to perform a matrix inversion and an eigen - decomposition to compute @xmath22 ; however , once the training is done , the filtering of new eeg trials can be conducted very efficiently by a simple matrix multiplication [ see ( [ eq : xi ] ) ] .",
    "let @xmath115 be the number of training samples .",
    "then , the actual training time of cspr - ovr and cspr - ova increased linearly with @xmath115 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compcost ] .",
    "the platform was a dell xps15 laptop ( intel i7 - 6700hq cpu @2.60ghz , 16 gb memory ) running windows 10 pro 64-bit and matlab 2016b .",
    "a least squares curve fit shows that the training time is @xmath116 seconds , which should not be a problem for a practical @xmath115 .    .",
    "recall that 5-fold cross - validation was used in the performance evaluation in the previous section , i.e. , we concatenated the nine - session data from the same subject , randomly partitioned them into five equal - length folds , and then used four folds for training and the remaining one for testing .",
    "so , the training and testing folds contained data from the same sessions .",
    "this is equivalent to the case that we label some session - specific data in offline regression .",
    "our results showed that in this case cspr - ovr and cspr - ova can significantly improve the regression performance .    to avoid the use of session - specific data",
    ", we also investigated a different validation method : leave - one - session - out validation , in which for each subject we trained the spatial filters using eight sessions and tested them on the remaining session .",
    "interestingly , all four feature sets and both regression models achieved very poor performance here .",
    "the reasons are : 1 ) we need a proper way to normalize the rss from different sessions , as done for the response times in @xcite ; and , 2 ) there is large intra - subject variation , meaning that the eeg responses for the same subject vary at different times ( recall that these nine sessions were collected at different days ) ; so , the patterns learned from previous sessions become obsolete for the new session , and hence spatial filtering alone does not help .",
    "however , our previous research @xcite has shown that transfer learning can cope well with the inter - subject variation ( individual differences ) in both classification and regression problems , and we conjecture that it can also handle the intra - subject variation .",
    "one of our future research directions is to demonstrate the performance of cspr - ovr and cspr - ova in a transfer learning framework to individualize a generalized model for regression problems , as done in @xcite for eeg - based cognitive performance classification .",
    "another direction of our future research will apply cspr - ovr and cspr - ova to other important eeg - based regression problems , e.g. , drowsiness ( or alertness ) estimation during driving , and integrate it with more sophisticated feature extraction approaches , e.g. , riemannian geometry @xcite , for better regression performance .",
    "eeg signals are easily contaminated by artifacts and noises , so preprocessing is needed before they are fed into a machine learning algorithm in bci .",
    "spatial filters , e.g. , ica , xdawn , csp and cca , have been widely used to increase the eeg signal quality for classification problems , but their applications in bci regression problems have been very limited . in this paper , we have proposed two csp filters for eeg - based regression problems in bci , which were extended from the csp filter for classification , by making use of fuzzy sets .",
    "extensive experimental results on eeg - based rs estimation from a large - scale study , which collected 143 sessions of pvt data from 17 subjects during a 5-month period , demonstrated that our proposed spatial filters can significantly increase the eeg signal quality . when used in lasso and knn",
    ", the spatial filters can reduce the estimation rmse by @xmath1 , and at the same time increase the cc by @xmath2 .",
