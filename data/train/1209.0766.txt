    "star cluster formation conditions have a profound impact on the properties of young star cluster systems . in particular , after massive star activity has cleansed a cluster - forming region ( cfrg ) of its residual star - forming gas , the mass fraction of stars bound to a cluster decreases steadily with time ( infant weight - loss ) until the cluster either reaches a new equilibrium , or is completely disrupted .",
    "this dynamical response of a cluster to gas expulsion is called violent relaxation . @xcite",
    "express the bound mass fraction of stars , @xmath0 , as a function of the cfrg star formation efficiency at the onset of gas expulsion , @xmath1 , of the gas expulsion time - scale , @xmath2 , and of the impact of an external tidal field which they quantify through the ratio of the initial half - mass radius to the initial tidal radius of the embedded - cluster , @xmath3 .",
    "that is : @xmath4 where @xmath0 is defined as the mass fraction of stars within the cluster tidal radius at time @xmath5 .",
    "note that the time - scale for gas expulsion , @xmath6 , and the time since gas expulsion , @xmath5 , are both expressed in units of the cfrg crossing - time , @xmath7 .",
    "this immediately implies that denser cfrgs give rise to faster - evolving clusters since @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the cfrg mean volume density .",
    "this property is the crux of the present contribution .",
    "the higher the @xmath1 , the longer the gas - expulsion time - scale @xmath2 , the weaker the tidal field impact @xmath3 ( i.e. the deeper the cluster lies within its limiting tidal radius ) , the smaller the cluster infant - weight loss , @xmath10 , at time @xmath11 .",
    "cluster violent relaxation therefore leaves an imprint on the age distribution @xcite and mass function of young star clusters @xcite .",
    "+ during the few 10s of myr after gas expulsion , infant weight - loss drives the cluster mass function towards lower cluster masses .",
    "the amplitude of this leftward shift as a function of time , and mass ( i.e. does the cluster mass function shape vary with time ? ) , constitutes a powerful probe into cluster formation conditions .",
    "most observational evidence gathered so far seem to support the scenario of mass - independent infant weight - loss , @xmath12 , at that young age . when plotted as the number of clusters per linear mass interval , the young cluster mass function in the present - day universe is a power - law of slope @xmath13 , @xmath14 , irrespective of the cluster age ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it should be kept in mind that , in assessing the slope of power - law cluster mass functions , systematic errors ( e.g. the errors inherent to the derivations of cluster mass estimates by different research groups ) are significantly larger than the statistical ones ( i.e. the formal fitting errors ) .",
    "for instance , @xcite find that the mass function slope of the large magellanic cloud clusters younger than 200myr is @xmath15 .",
    "this is steeper than the slope reported by @xcite for a similar cluster age range , i.e. @xmath16 .",
    "this simple example shows that to detect an intrinsic change of @xmath17 in the cluster mass function slope is not straightforward .",
    "we note that through a careful analysis of the combined star cluster systems of several galaxies  an approach which aims at decreasing statistical uncertainties at the high mass end ",
    "@xcite shows that the cluster mass function obeys a schechter function , rather than a featureless power - law , with a cut - off mass higher in starbursts and mergers than in quiescent spiral discs .",
    "the amount of mass - independent dissolution affecting young clusters remains heavily debated .",
    "based on the relation between the mass of the most massive cluster and the age range sampled , @xcite infer almost negligeable mass - independent dissolution , i.e. 20% per age dex as compared to 90% per age dex for @xcite .",
    "we stress that these observational uncertainties do not affect the general conclusions we present here .",
    "if infant weight - loss is mass - independent , this straightforwardly implies mass - independent @xmath1 and mass - independent @xmath2 , although the constraint on @xmath2 is looser than for the @xmath1 ( see section 4.1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion ) .",
    "for a given external tidal field ( e.g. a limited region of a given galaxy ) , it also implies the mass - independence of @xmath3 .",
    "this constraint is robustly satisfied if the mass - radius relation of cfrgs is one of constant mean volume density @xcite , i.e. @xmath18 , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 the radius and mass of cfrgs , respectively .",
    "mass - independent @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 therefore imply that the cluster mass functions at the onset and end of violent relaxation have the same shape , albeit different amplitudes due to cluster infant weight - loss .    a fourth , and so far overlooked ,",
    "aspect is how the _ cluster evolutionary rate _ shapes the cluster mass function _ during _ violent relaxation .",
    "if the mass - radius relation of cfrgs is one of constant mean surface density ( i.e. @xmath21 ) , more massive cfrgs have a lower mean volume density and , therefore , evolve on a slower time - scale .",
    "conversely , if cfrgs all have the same radius , @xmath19 , irrespective of mass , higher - mass cfrgs give rise to faster - evolving star clusters , as illustrated by fig .  1 of @xcite . in that example",
    ", the constant radius also implies that more massive cfrgs have deeper gravitational potential wells hence slower gas - expulsion time - scales .",
    "this allows high - mass clusters to survive despite a low @xmath1 of @xmath22 , while low - mass ones are disrupted .",
    "the mass - dependent gas - expulsion time - scale thereby carves a turnover in the initially power - law cluster mass function .",
    "the same figure also shows that , as clusters evolve after gas expulsion , transient patterns sets in the cluster mass function due to the mass - dependent evolutionary rate . at an intermediate age of 15myr ,",
    "clusters less massive than @xmath23 ( i.e. low - density clusters ) have hardly evolved and their mass function sticks to the initial one . that is , none of their stars have yet crossed their tidal boundary .",
    "conversely , clusters more massive than @xmath24 ( i.e. high density clusters ) have completed their violent relaxation , and the bell - shaped cluster mass function already shows up in the high - mass regime .    in this contribution , we expand the work of @xcite .",
    "we highlight how the cfrg mass - radius relation affects the evolutionary rate of star clusters in dependence of their mass and , therefore , the cluster mass function evolution .",
    "in particular , we quantify transient mass - dependent effects which do take place _ even if the cluster mass function shapes at the onset and at the end of violent relaxation are alike . _",
    "although we illustrate our point with a power - law cluster mass function experiencing 90% infant weight - loss , we emphasize that the cluster mass function patterns highlighted below do take place regardless of the initial cluster mass function shape and regardless of the infant weight - loss rate .    while the cluster mass function evolution constitutes a good tracer of violent relaxation on the scale of star cluster _",
    "systems _ , the dynamical evolution of an _ individual _ cluster after gas expulsion can be traced by the ratio of its dynamical - to - luminous mass estimates , @xmath25 .",
    "again , the shorter the initial crossing - time , the faster the return of the cluster to virial equilibrium where @xmath26 .",
    "the question of whether a young cluster can be observed in virial equilibrium ( e.g. wd  1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) despite having been put out of equilibrium by a significant gas - expulsion episode in the recent past is thus directly related to its initial crossing - time hence to the cfrg mass - radius relation . as we shall see in the present work , the problem is complexified by the size of the aperture with which the cluster is observed . for a given time - span after gas expulsion , smaller apertures are more likely to miss the fast - moving unbound stars , thereby decreasing the observed @xmath25 ratios with respect to larger apertures .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "mod ] , we quantify the interplay between the cluster mass function shape and the cfrg mass - radius relation in the case of a weak tidal field . section [ sec : ap ] models the time - evolution of the cluster dynamical - to - luminous mass ratio , @xmath25 .",
    "we demonstrate that the time - scale for a cluster to recover virial equilibrium after gas expulsion depends on the size of the aperture with which it is observed .",
    "our discussion helps understand why a few massive clusters are observed in virial equilibrium despite a young age of several myr only .",
    "we present our conclusions in section [ sec : conclu ] .",

    "* ) , the time - span since gas expulsion may be as short as 10 initial crossing - times ( assuming an age of 1myr at gas expulsion and @xmath193myr ) . at first glance , this seems to disprove a gas - expulsion scenario like that shown in panels b - c of fig .",
    "[ fig : mdml ] .",
    "however , it proves crucial to consider how the dynamical mass is derived and , again , how small the aperture is .",
    "@xcite map proper motions of stars within the central 10@xmath194 10of the cluster ( or 0.4pc @xmath194 0.4pc , equivalent to a projected radius of 0.2pc ) . combining their proper motion measurements with cluster modelling , they estimate the dynamical mass contained within a cylinder of radius 0.4pc to be about @xmath195 .",
    "this is comparable to their luminous mass estimate within the same aperture , namely , @xmath1961 - 2@xmath197 . the small radius of 0.4pc is comparable to , or smaller than , the initial half - mass radius of the cluster ( see our estimate for wd  1 above ) .",
    "one thus needs a model with @xmath198 , a limit which our present @xmath28-body simulations do not achieve .",
    "all we can anticipate is that , within such a small aperture , the cluster is observed to return to virial equilibrium even faster than in any of our simulations .",
    "there is a strong caveat , however . in the models presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdml ] , the dynamical mass is estimated based on _ radial velocity measurements _ ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : mdyn_rap ] ) .",
    "the arches cluster study of @xcite builds on _ proper motion measurements_. although the development of a model akin to eq .",
    "[ eq : mdyn_rap ] for proper - motion - based dynamical masses is beyond the scope of the present paper , we point out that the measurements of proper motions in a small aperture _ necessarily _ miss the expanding external layers which characterize a star cluster after gas expulsion .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pm ] where the horizontal ( blue ) arrows depict the radial motions and the vertical ( red ) ones depict the proper motions .",
    "the aperture is shown as the shaded area .",
    "while radial velocity measurements probe the full radial extent of the expanding cluster , proper motion measurements are restricted to the 3-dimensional central regions .",
    "one may thus expect a lower measured velocity dispersion when based on proper motions than when based on radial velocities , hence @xmath199 where @xmath200 and @xmath201 are the dynamical mass estimates obtained from the proper motions and radial velocities , respectively . to sum up , because of an aperture comparable in size to the initial half - mass radius of the cluster , and because of a cluster dynamical mass estimated from the proper motions of the cluster central regions only , it can not be excluded that @xmath202 is observed at the present arches - cluster age even though the cluster experienced a major gas expulsion episode in the recent past .",
    "the above discussions highlight the complexity of inferring whether the observed virial equilibrium of young gas - free star clusters is compatible with a gas - expulsion scenario .",
    "a key - issue is that pivotal model parameters such as _ ( 1 ) _ the initial crossing - time , hence the cfrg mean volume density , and _ ( 2 ) _ the size of the field - of - view with respect to the cluster initial half - mass radius , are not well - constrained .",
    "it is of course crucial to ensure that models and observations are comparable .",
    "that is , a model with a long crossing - time might be appropriate for the so - called ` leaky ' clusters @xcite , while it severely underestimates the rate of dynamical evolution of ` starburst ' clusters such as wd  1 and the arches .",
    "the observed @xmath203 ratio is subject to its own uncertainties , related to _ ( 1 ) _ the cluster luminous mass estimate , @xmath93 ( see the exemple of wd  1 in the above discussion ) , _ ( 2 ) _ the measured velocity dispersion , @xmath127 , and _ ( 3 ) _ the observed half - light radius . here",
    ", an additional source of complication is that the half - light radius is stellar - mass dependent if the cluster is primordially mass - segregated ( which may be the case for ngc 3603 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "note that the models presented here are not primordially mass - segregated since the @xmath28-body simulations of @xcite build on equal - mass particles . [ models for the evolution of primordially mass - segregated gas - free clusters are presented in @xcite and the impact of stellar - evolutionary mass - losses is studied in @xcite ] .",
    "figure [ fig : mdml ] clearly demonstrates that star clusters as young as a few myr observed in virial equilibrium and gas - expulsion driven cluster evolution are not mutually exclusive .",
    "we encourage observers to estimate and quote the crossing - time of the star clusters they study , as well as the size of the field of view they scrutinize .",
    "both parameters play a pivotal role in assessing reliably the dynamical state of a star cluster .",
    "finally , we caution that in figs  [ fig : mdml ] and [ fig : mdlv ] the cluster dynamical mass is obtained from the _ radial _ velocity dispersion .",
    "models of the time - evolution of @xmath204 , where @xmath200 builds on star _ proper motions _ , are highly desirable .",
    "we have studied the impact of cluster - mass - dependent evolutionary rates upon the evolution of the cluster mass function through violent relaxation . to highlight this so far overlooked process , we have built model star cluster systems with mass - independent star formation efficiency ( @xmath1 ) , gas - expulsion time - scale ( @xmath2 ) and tidal field impact ( @xmath3 ) . due to the resulting mass - independent infant weight - loss at the end of violent relaxation , the final cluster mass function and the embedded - cluster mass function",
    "have the same shape .",
    "yet , that does not necessarily imply that the cluster mass function _ during _ violent relaxation retains the same shape as that of embedded clusters .",
    "if the evolutionary rate is mass - dependent , it transiently distorts the cluster mass function .",
    "mass - dependent evolutionary rates arise when the cfrg mass - radius relation is not one of constant mean volume density ( since @xmath8 ) .",
    "for instance , for cfrgs with a constant radius ( @xmath19 model , bottom panels of figs  [ fig : mf]-[fig : mfb ] ) , more massive clusters evolve faster and complete their violent relaxation earlier than low - mass clusters .",
    "conversely , in case of cfrgs of constant mean surface density , dynamical evolution is slower in the high - mass regime ( @xmath45 model , top panels of figs  [ fig : mf]-[fig : mfb ] ) .",
    "therefore , to preserve the shape of the cluster mass function during violent relaxation requires cfrgs of constant mean volume density . in that case , the bound fraction of stars is mass - independent at _ any age _ during violent relaxation ( @xmath9 model , middle panels of figs  [ fig : mf]-[fig : mfb ] ) .",
    "we caution , however , that the influence of the cfrg mass - radius relation upon the evolving cluster mass function is weakened when the scatter in cluster initial properties is accounted for ( e.g. range in sfe , scatter in radius around a mean mass - radius relation , etc ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : mfblur ] ) .",
    "a direct comparison of our models to observations still requires additional work , however . in our simulations ,",
    "the mass of a cluster is defined as its bound mass , namely , the mass enclosed within its instantaneous tidal radius .",
    "this may differ from the cluster mass inferred by observers . due to their gas - expulsion - driven spatial expansion ,",
    "star clusters develop untruncated power - law density profiles @xcite at young ages .",
    "that is , unbound stars beyond the tidal radius are not yet spatially dissociated from their ` parent ' clusters .",
    "therefore , contrary to older clusters , no truncation in the cluster density profile marks its tidal radius .",
    "the observed mass of those young clusters is thus inferred as the cluster stellar mass brighter than the host galaxy background ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an introductory work ) .",
    "nevertheless , infant weight - loss beyond the tidal radius and cluster spatial expansion are correlated ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at a given age , stronger spatial expansion dims the cluster surface brightness .",
    "therefore , the cluster bound mass fraction and the cluster mass fraction brighter than the background of stars and gas of the host galaxy are correlated too .",
    "we thus expect the same cluster mass function patterns for cluster masses defined based on a surface brightness limit criterion , although the amplitude of the mass function distortions may differ from those found here . in spite of this caveat ,",
    "it is clear that our work has highlighted , again , the richness of the cluster mass function as a tracer of star cluster formation conditions .    on the scale of individual clusters ,",
    "violent relaxation can be traced by the evolution of the ratio between the dynamical and luminous masses of a cluster , @xmath25 .",
    "models of @xmath25 as a function of dynamical time have been computed for various star formation efficiencies and gas - expulsion time - scales ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mdml ] ) .",
    "our simulations range from disrupted clusters to clusters barely affected by gas expulsion .",
    "we insist that for a given set of parameters ( sfe , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) , the rate of dynamical evolution is determined by the cfrg crossing - time .",
    "our study has quantified an effect ignored so far : the impact of the size of the field - of - view on the observed @xmath25 ratio .",
    "smaller apertures are conducive to smaller @xmath25 ratios for the following two reasons _ ( 1 ) _ cluster inner regions return to equilibrium at a time when outer layers still expand through the tidal radius ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ap ] ) . _",
    "( 2 ) _ a smaller aperture ` sees ' a smaller fraction of the stars expanding beyond the cluster tidal radius ( i.e. at large distance from the cluster centre , the only expanding stars to be observed are those in the vicinity of the line - of - sight ) , which decreases the measured radial velocity dispersion @xmath205 . both effects lower the mass ratio @xmath25 , that is , a cluster observed after gas expulsion through a smaller aperture is perceived as closer to dynamical equilibrium and its return to equilibrium is seen as faster ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mdml ] ) .",
    "we stress that what actually matters is the size of the aperture in units of the cluster initial half - mass radius .",
    "if the cluster initial crossing - time is short and the observed field - of - view is no larger than a few pc , it is indeed possible to infer @xmath206 even though the cluster experienced significant gas expulsion a few myr earlier .",
    "both the cluster mass function and cluster dynamical mass aspects of our work emphasize the crucial importance of the crossing - time to the evolutionary rate of young star clusters .",
    "we strongly encourage observers to estimate and quote the crossing - time of the young star clusters they study , although the observed crossing - time may differ from the initial one by a factor of a few . from a dynamical point of view",
    ", the age of a star cluster expressed in physical - time units hardly tells anything about its evolutionary stage .",
    "the relevant quantity is the age expressed in units of the cluster _ initial _ crossing - time , that is , the cfrg crossing - time ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mrr ] ) . to obtain a reliable estimate of the latter is thus crucial when it comes to combining dynamical and photometric modellings of star clusters , as their respective time - units , the initial crossing - time and the year , differ ( e.g. see fig .",
    "[ fig : mdlv ] for a conversion of the @xmath25 ratio into the luminosity - to - dynamical mass ratio ) .",
    "the mass - radius relation of cfrgs  both its slope and normalization  determines the initial crossing - time of star clusters . as such , it remains central to our understanding of star cluster dynamical evolution after residual star - forming gas expulsion .",
