    "the production of macroscopic two - dimensional ( 2d ) graphene sheets by mechanical cleavaging @xcite has demonstrated that free - standing or suspended 2d crystals can exist despite large positional fluctuations in two dimensions . since then , a variety of other free - standing 2d crystallites have been prepared @xcite . wrapped",
    "versions of the 2d free - standing graphene had been found much earlier in 1991 @xcite .",
    "recent observations @xcite have confirmend the theoretical expectation that freely suspended graphene sheets are strongly undulated and behave more like solid membranes than two dimensional ( 2d ) crystals @xcite .",
    "the undulations are a consequence of the thermal fluctuations of the membrane . in this paper",
    ", we calculate these fluctuations quantitatively and discuss their implications upon the melting properties such as lindemann parameter and melting temperature .",
    "@xcite the results will be compared with corresponding 2d crystals .    the easiest way to estimate the melting temperature of a three dimensional",
    "( 3d ) crystal is based on the lindemann criterium @xcite . according to it ,",
    "a 3d crystal starts to melt when the square root of the thermal expectation value of lattice site elongations @xmath0 exceeds a certain fraction of the nearest - neighbor lattice distance @xmath1 , usually around @xmath2 @xcite . above the melting temperature ,",
    "the shear modulus of the lattice vanishes leading to a divergence in the displacement fluctuations typical for the liquid state .    in two dimensions ( 2d )",
    "this criterium is no longer applicable since the displacement fluctuations are always logarithmically divergent , reflecting the fact that after a long time , a 2d crystal migrates through the entire 2d - space .",
    "there exists , however , a simple modification @xcite . instead of @xmath3 one may use the finite cumulants @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the difference vector between the atoms associated with the nearest - neighbor lattice sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this leads to a modified lindemann number @xmath8 here @xmath9 denotes the set of all nearest - neighbor lattice pairs and @xmath10 their number . for the lennard - jones and wigner lattices , bedanov _ et al .",

    "we have derived the same values analytically for a triangular generalization @xcite of a square lattice defect melting model @xcite .    at this point",
    "it is useful to realize that a migration problem and an associated divergence of @xmath12 exists also in three dimensions if the system is finite , i.e. , for 3d clusters and polymers .",
    "there one defines a modified lindemann number @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the set of _ all _ lattice site pairs whose number is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of atoms in the lattice .",

    "this is indeed the case for 3d crystals .    in this paper",

    "it will turn out that for these @xmath30 is unsuitable for calculating the melting temperature .",
    "the reason lies in the large out - of - plane fluctuations of the membrane vary little when crossing the melting point .",

    "the value of the lindemann number @xmath18 was around @xmath36 at the onset of melting defined by the abrupt increase of @xmath18 .",
    "however , when using the region of strong increase of the internal energy they obtain a range @xmath37 from the onset of melting to its completion .",
    "the shapes of swnts near the melting temperature are in general strongly deformed from a pure tube form .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the 2d nearest - neighbor lindemann number @xmath38 ( [ 10 ] ) is not a useful quantity for a melting criterion .",
    "one rather should use the lindemann - like numbers ( [ 20 ] ) or the 3d form of ( [ 10 ] ) which both respect the 3d rotational symmetry of the system . in the following",

    "we shall restrict ourselves to the ( 5,5 ) swnt so that we can compare our theoretical results with existing simulation data .",
    "we shall find that despite the large vertical fluctuations of the membranes , the lindemann number ( [ 20 ] ) depends mostly on the in - plane fluctuations and provides us with a valuable melting criterium .",
    "this is not the case for the 3d - version of the lindemann number @xmath39 having its reason in the fact that the out - of plane fluctuations are even larger than the in - plane fluctuations for swnts and graphene .",

    "the quantity @xmath48 is an external stress source which will help us to calculate ( [ 10 ] ) , ( [ 20 ] ) from derivatives of the partition function with respect to @xmath49 .",

    "thus we calculate @xmath53 by first inserting the line element @xmath54 in ( [ 20 ] ) , and afterwards expanding the resulting expressions for small displacements .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath55 here @xmath56 are the unit vectors pointing from site @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "in deriving ( [ 50 ] ) we used a taylor expansion of the elongation differences between two lattice sites ( gradient expansion ) .",
    "this is justified for the small elongation differences of neighboring atoms occurring in @xmath57 and @xmath58 up to the melting regime . in the atom pairs",
    "summed over in @xmath59 , the approximation is good only for small clusters or for small supercells in molecular dynamic simulations . for infinite solid membranes ,",
