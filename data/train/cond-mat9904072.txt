    "recently , a great experimental material has been obtained for anomalous @xmath1-systems demonstrating so - called non - fermi - liquid ( nfl ) behavior @xcite .",
    "manifestations of the nfl behavior are unusual temperature dependences of magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath2 ) , electronic specific heat ( @xmath3 is proportional to @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) and resistivity ( @xmath6 ) , etc . such a behavior is observed not only in alloys where disorder is present ( u@xmath7y@xmath8pd@xmath9 , upt@xmath10pd@xmath7 , ucu@xmath11pd@xmath7 , cecu@xmath12au@xmath7 , u@xmath13th@xmath14be@xmath15 ) , but also in some stoichiometric compounds , e.g. , ce@xmath16ni@xmath9 @xcite , cecu@xmath17si@xmath18ceni@xmath17ge@xmath17 @xcite . the latter situation is most interesting from the physical point of view @xcite .",
    "there are a number of theoretical mechanisms proposed to describe the nfl state : two - channel kondo scattering @xcite , `` griffiths singularities '' in disordered magnets @xcite , strong spin fluctuations near a quantum magnetic phase transition @xcite etc .",
    "most of modern treatments of the nfl problem have a semiphenomenological character . the only microscopic model where formation of the nfl state is proven - the one - impurity two - channel kondo model - seems to be insufficient , since important role of intersite interactions is now a matter of common experience @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we start from the standard microscopic model of a periodical kondo lattice",
    ". main role in the physics of the kondo lattices belongs to the interplay of the on - site kondo screening and intersite exchange interactions .",
    "this interplay results in the mutual renormalization of the characteristic energy scales : the kondo temperature @xmath19 and spin - fluctuation frequency @xmath20 .",
    "we shall demonstrate that during the renormalization process `` soft '' boson branches can be formed , presence of singularities of spin spectral function being of crucial importance .",
    "scattering of electrons by such soft collective excitations just leads to the formation of the nfl state ( cf .",

    "2 the renormalization group ( scaling ) equations are presented . in sect.3",
    "we consider the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) state with account of the spin - wave damping and the paramagnetic state with simple spin - diffusive dynamics .",
    "it turns out that in these cases a nfl - like behavior ( in a restricted temperature interval ) is possible , especially in the case of quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) spin fluctuations . in sect .",
    "4 we consider the general problem of singularities of the scaling function . in sect.5 we show that the nfl behavior up to lowest temperatures can be naturally obtained provided that we take into account magnon - like excitations in the case of a complicated spin dynamics .",
    "the excitation picture required is characteristic for real @xmath1-systems where several excitation branches exist . in sect.6",
    "we discuss various physical properties and possible relation to experimental data .",
    "to describe a kondo lattice , we use the @xmath0 exchange model @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the band energy , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are spin - density operators and their fourier transforms , @xmath25 is the @xmath0 exchange parameter , @xmath26 are the intersite exchange parameters , @xmath27 are the pauli matrices , @xmath28 is the anisotropy hamiltonian which results in occurrence of the gap @xmath29 in the spin - wave spectrum . in refs.@xcite , the interplay of the kondo effect and intersite interactions was investigated by the renormalization group approach .",
    "the latter starts from the second - order perturbation theory with the use of the equation - of - motion method ( within the diagram technique in the pseudofermion representation for the spin operators , such an approximation corresponds to the one - loop scaling ) .",
    "the relevant variables are the effective ( renormalized ) parameter of @xmath0 coupling @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is a flow cutoff parameter , @xmath32 is the bare density of electron states at the fermi level ) , characteristic `` exchange '' spin - fluctuation energy @xmath33 , gap in the spin - wave spectrum @xmath34 , and magnetic moment @xmath35 . in the magnetically ordered phase ,",

    "as demonstrated in ref.@xcite , the singularities of the scaling function @xmath59 can result in occurrence of a nfl behavior in a restricted region due to fixing of the argument of the function @xmath59 at the singularity during the scaling process , so that @xmath60 ( the scale @xmath61 is defined by @xmath62 ) .",
    "this region becomes not too narrow only provided that the bare coupling constant @xmath63 is very close to the critical value @xmath64 for the magnetic instability ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "here we consider the scaling process with account of a not too small magnon damping ( only very small damping was introduced in ref.@xcite to provide existence of the magnetic - non - magnetic ground - state transition at @xmath66 ) .",

    "the function @xmath76 determines , in particular , the factor @xmath58 in ( [ w+g ] ) . for a parabolic electron spectrum",
    "we obtain @xmath77 where @xmath78 @xmath79 is the step function , @xmath80 is the electron concentration ( with both spin projections ) .",

    "is followed by a quasi - linear behavior with @xmath86 where @xmath87 to investigate the latter behavior in more details , it is instructive to consider also the case of a paramagnet with pure dissipative dynamics . in the case of spin - diffusion behavior",

    "to get further insight into the nfl - behavior problem , we perform an analysis of singularities of the scaling function @xmath72 which is more general than in ref.@xcite . in the absence of damping",
    "we can write down    @xmath100    the singularities of @xmath59 correspond to the van hove singularities in the magnon spectrum and to the boundary points @xmath101 and @xmath102    for @xmath103 the magnon spectrum has the kohn anomaly @xmath104 taking into account the dependences ( [ lam ] ) , which hold qualitatively in a general situation , we obtain for @xmath105@xmath106 note that the singularity of the form @xmath107 obtained for the @xmath108 case in ref.@xcite ( see also previous section ) , is a consequence of a simplified `` debye '' model of the magnon spectrum .",
    "in fact , such a dependence corresponds qualitatively to an intermediate asymptotics at approaching the singularity . in any case ,",
    "a small damping of spin excitations should be introduced to cut the singularity . in the calculations below we put the damping parameter @xmath109 ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "in fact , pronounced extrema of @xmath72 but not singularities themselves turn out to be important for the scaling behavior discussed below .",

    "the van hove singularities in the magnon band at @xmath118 for @xmath119 yield weaker singularities in @xmath120 ( @xmath121 for @xmath122 and a finite jump for @xmath123 ) and will not be treated below .",
    "using the results of the previous section we can propose a rather realistic and universal mechanism of the nfl behavior .",
    "suppose that the spin excitation spectrum contains several branches which make additive contributions to the function @xmath124    as a simple example we can consider a two - sublattice ferrimagnet with the localized - system hamiltonian @xmath125 the @xmath0 exchange interaction being taken into account only at one sublattice ( spins without primes ) .",

    "the only property of the function @xmath130 , which will be important below , is the occurrence of the _ second _ zero with decreasing @xmath131 ( or increasing @xmath132 ) .",
    "this property follows immediately from existence of the `` positive '' singularity in @xmath130 near the maximum frequency of the lower branch and of the `` negative '' singularity near the minimum frequency of the upper branch ( e.g. , for @xmath133 )",
    ". one can expect that this is a general property of many - sublattice magnets .",
    "the singularities can be also connected with the crystal - field excitations @xcite .",

    "this can be illustrated for the simple case where @xmath136 for all the modes ( e.g. , for an antiferromagnet in the nearest - neighbor approximation we have @xmath137 ) .",

    "the scaling picture for three possible cases is shown in fig.4 .",
    "one can see that the interval @xmath148 $ ] where the nfl behavior occurs is not too small , unlike ref.@xcite .    in a more general case , where @xmath149 and the exponents in ( [ sl ] ) differ for different frequencies , the linear @xmath150-dependence takes place only for the total characteristic frequency @xmath20 ( e.g. , for an anisotropic antiferromagnet with one mode we have @xmath151 ) , and the behavior @xmath95 and @xmath152",
    "is more complicated . as follows from ( [ alph ] ) , for the afm state with small next - nearest exchange interactions the case of small @xmath153 and @xmath154 @xmath155 is realized .",

    "we have for an afm structure with the wavevector @xmath156@xmath157 one can assume that the spin - wave description of the electron - magnon interaction is adequate not only in the afm phase , but also for systems with a strong short - range afm order ( e.g. , for 2d and frustrated 3d systems at finite temperatures ) .",
    "anomalous @xmath1-systems demonstrate indeed pronounced quasi-2d spin fluctuations , see , e.g. , refs.@xcite . using the scaling arguments we can replace @xmath158 @xmath159 with @xmath160 which yields @xmath161 according to ( [ alph ] ) , the non - universal exponent @xmath162 is determined by details of magnetic structure and can be both positive and negative . for a qualitative discussion , we can still use fig.4 and treat the difference @xmath163 as a perturbation .",
    "the increase of @xmath164 ( which is usually called nfl behavior ) takes place for @xmath165 and , as follows from ( [ w+g ] ) , corresponds to an increase of magnetic anisotropy parameter with lowering @xmath166 ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "such a correlation may be verified experimentally .",

    "then we have @xmath169 the dependence @xmath170 has been recently obtained experimentally for a wide class of nfl systems @xcite .",
    "one can expect that the accuracy of the experimental data is insufficient to pick out the factor of @xmath171 generally , the temperature behavior of magnetic characteristics ( @xmath172 and @xmath20 ) , which depend exponentially on the coupling constant , is decisive for our nfl mechanisms . the transport relaxation rate determining the temperature dependence of the resistivity owing to scattering by spin fluctuations in afm phase is given by @xcite @xmath173 then we obtain @xmath174 considering electron - electron scattering as the main scattering mechanism one can expect another temperature dependence , namely      it would be interesting to compare experimental dependences on one hand , of the resistivity and , on the other hand , of the susceptibility and specific heat , to choose between dependences ( [ taul ] ) and ( [ tau2 ] ) .",
    "validity of the relation ( [ taul ] ) would be a verification of the scenario for nfl state formation proposed here .",
    "the temperature dependences of specific heat , magnetic susceptibility and resistivity in the case of a nfl - like behavior considered in sect.3 differ from those discussed above by the value of @xmath176 ( for the second `` linear '' region ) .",
    "to conclude , phenomenon of the nfl behavior seems to have a complicated nature , so that it is hardly possible to propose an unified picture for all the cases .",
    "the mechanisms considered above are not based on disorder effects , but describe naturally the nfl state in ideal crystals . at the same time",
    ", the damping makes the quasi - nfl behavior considered in sect.3 more pronounced and in a sense plays the role of disorder .",
    "the damping is not important for the nfl behavior mechanism considered in sect.5 .",
    "this nfl picture is `` true '' ( i.e. holds up to lowest temperatures ) within the lowest - order scaling approach ; treatment of higher - order corrections to the scaling equations would provide additional information . unlike previous phenomenological works , existence of peculiar long - range critical fluctuations near the quantum phase transition is not needed for this mechanism , but local reconstruction of electronic states owing to the kondo effect is essential , the concrete form of spin spectral function being of crucial importance .",
    "more detailed investigations of the nfl behavior for complicated spectral functions , in particular with account of incoherent contributions , would be also of interest .",
