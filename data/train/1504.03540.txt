    "magnetically driven ferroelectricity is one of the major topics in the condensed matter physics today .",
    "even though the basic crystallographic symmetry of a magnetic material may not allow for the existence of a spontaneous electric polarization , this symmetry can be further lowered by the magnetic order , which in some cases gives rise to the ferroelectric ( fe ) activity .",
    "after discovery of such effect in tbmno@xmath13,@xcite where the inversion symmetry is broken by some complex noncollinear magnetic order , there is a large number of experimental and theoretical proposals pointing at the existence of a similar effect in other magnetic materials , which are called multiferroics.@xcite    ba@xmath0coge@xmath0o@xmath1 and related compounds take a special place among multiferroic materials .",
    "they crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric @xmath2 structure,@xcite which nonetheless does not permit the fe effect because of the fourfold rotoinversion symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , unlike inversion , the rotoinversion symmetry can be relatively easy destroyed by the magnetic order , by canting the magnetic moments out of the rotoinversion axis .",
    "thus , one unique aspect of ba@xmath0coge@xmath0o@xmath1 is that the ferroelectricity in this compound can be induced relatively simple c - type antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic structure of ba@xmath0coge@xmath0o@xmath1 is relatively soft : it consists of the coo@xmath5 tetrahedra , which are interconnected with each other via nonmagnetic geo@xmath5 tetrahedra ( see fig .  [",
    "fig.structure]a ) .",
    "( color online ) crystal and spin magnetic structure of ba@xmath0coge@xmath0o@xmath1 : ( a ) general view on the crystal structure in the @xmath3 plane .",
    "the co and o atoms are indicated by the medium red and yellow spheres , respectively , the ba atoms are indicated by the big green spheres , and the ge atoms are indicated by the small blue spheres .",

    "the light ( cyan ) arrows indicate the directions of spins favored by the single - ion anisotropy , while the dark ( blue ) arrows are the joint effect of the single - ion anisotropy and interatomic exchange interactions . , width=377 ]    since two magnetic co sites in this structure are separated by the long co - o - ge - o - co paths ,",
    "the exchange interactions between them are expected to be small and the magnetic structure can be easily deformed by the external magnetic field .",
    "the possibilities of easy manipulation by the magnetic structure and switching the fe properties have attracted a great deal of attention to ba@xmath0coge@xmath0o@xmath1 , and today it was demonstrated in many details how the electric polarization in ba@xmath0coge@xmath0o@xmath1 can be tuned by the magnetic field ( refs .  ) as well as the uniaxial stress ( ref .  ) .",
    "the experimental behavior of the electric polarization in ba@xmath0coge@xmath0o@xmath1 is frequently interpreted basing on the model model of spin - dependent @xmath11-@xmath12 hybridization : if @xmath14 is the direction of the spin magnetic moment at the co site , located in the origin , and @xmath15 is the position of a ligand oxygen atom , relative to this origin , the bond co - o contributes to the local electric dipole moment as @xmath16.@xcite this simple phenomenological expression is able to capture the symmetry properties of the electric polarization and , thus , explain the behavior of this polarization on a phenomenological level .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that a qualitatively similar behavior of the electric polarization was obtained in the first - principles electronic structure calculations,@xcite which generally support the model of spin - dependent @xmath11-@xmath12 hybridization .",
    "on the other hand , the correct quantum - mechanical definition of the electric polarization is solids should be based on the berry - phase theory.@xcite this theory provides not only an efficient computational framework , which is used today in most of the first - principles electronic structure calculations , but also appears to be a good starting point for the construction of realistic microscopic models , explaining the origin and basic aspects of the behavior of electric polarization in various types of compounds.@xcite in this work we will pursue this strategy for the analysis of electric polarization in ba@xmath0coge@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "first , we will show that , in the atomic ( wannier ) basis , the electric polarization consists of two parts : the local one , which is expressed via the expectation value @xmath7 $ ] of some local dipole matrices @xmath8 and site - diagonal density matrices @xmath9 , and the anomalous one , which is solely related to the phases of the coefficients of the expansion of the wavefunctions in the basis of atomic wannier orbitals .",
    "similar classification holds for the orbital magnetization.@xcite then , if the crystal structure possesses the inversion symmetry , the local term becomes inactive and the electric polarization , induced by the magnetic inversion symmetry breaking , is anomalous in origin .",
    "such situation occurs , for instance , in multiferroic manganites with the orthorhombic structure.@xcite in ba@xmath0coge@xmath0o@xmath1 , however , the situation is exactly the opposite : to a good approximation , the electric polarization is expressed as a sum of local electric dipole moments of individual co sites , while the anomalous contribution is negligibly small .",
    "this explains many experimental details of the behavior of electric polarization in ba@xmath0coge@xmath0o@xmath1 as well as basic difference of this compound from other multiferroic materials .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the method is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] .",
    "we use the same strategy as in our previous works , devoted to the analysis of multiferroic properties of various transition - metal oxides on the basis of effective realistic low - energy models , derived from the first - principles calculations.@xcite therefore , in sec .",

    "we will estimate the ferromagnetic ( fm ) contribution to the interatomic exchange interaction cause by the magnetic polarization of the oxygen @xmath17 band and discuss how such effect can be evaluated starting from the low - energy electron model for the magnetic co @xmath6 bands .",
    "in this section , we briefly remind the reader the main ideas behind the construction of the effective low - energy electron model . the details can be found in the review article ( ref .  ) .",
    "the model hamiltonian , @xmath18 is formulated in the basis of wannier orbitals @xmath19 , which are constructed for the magnetically active co @xmath6 bands near the fermi level , starting from the band structure in the local - density approximation ( lda ) without spin - orbit ( so ) coupling ( fig .",

    "each lattice point @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) is specified by the position @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) of the atomic site in the primitive cell and the lattice translation @xmath42 .",
    "hence , the basis orbitals @xmath43@xmath33@xmath42@xmath33@xmath44 are centered in the lattice point @xmath45@xmath46@xmath44 and labeled by the indices @xmath47 and @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , they satisfies the orthonormality condition : @xmath48    in our case , the wannier function were calculated using the projector - operator method ( refs .  ) and orthonormal linear muffin - tin orbitals ( lmto s , ref .  ) as the trial wave functions .",
    "typically such procedure allows us to generate well localized wannier functions , that is guaranteed by the good localization of lmto s themselves .",
    "then , the one - electron part of the model ( [ eqn.manybodyh ] ) is identified with the matrix elements of lda hamiltonian ( @xmath49 ) in the wannier basis : @xmath50@xmath33@xmath51@xmath33@xmath42@xmath33@xmath52 .",
    "since the wannier basis is complete in the low - energy part of the spectrum , the construction is exact in the sense that the band structure , obtained from @xmath53 , exactly coincides with the one of lda .",
    "all wannier basis and one - electron parameters @xmath54 were first computed without the so interaction .",
    "then , the so interaction at each atomic site was included in the `` second - variation step '' , in the basis of the nonrelativistic wannier functions : @xmath55 , as explained in ref .  .",
    "matrix elements of screened coulomb interactions can be also computed in the wannier basis as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is obtained using the constrained rpa technique.@xcite then , @xmath57 does not depend on spin variables and @xmath58 .",
    "since rpa is very time consuming technique , we employ additional simplifications , which were discussed in ref .  .",
    "namely , first we evaluate the screened coulomb and exchange interactions between atomic co @xmath6 orbitals , using fast and more suitable for these purposes constrained lda technique .",
    "after that , we consider additional channel of screening caused by the @xmath59 transitions in the polarization function of constrained rpa and projecting this function onto atomic @xmath6 orbitals .",

    "due to the orthogonality condition ( [ eqn : orthogon ] ) , the leading contribution to @xmath82 comes from the wannier functions centered at the same atomic site .",

    "if this order is antiferroelectric , there will be no net polarization . nevertheless , if this order permits a fe component , the system will exhibit a finite net polarization .",
    "the details of such symmetry lowering will depend on directions of magnetic moments at the sites 1 and 2 .",
