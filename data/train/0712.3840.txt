    "the fundamental benchmark for this issue is a classical theorem , first conjectured by t. rad in 1926 @xcite , which was proved immediately after by h. kneser @xcite , and subsequently rediscovered , with a different proof , by g. choquet @xcite .",

    "[ parabola.th ] for every jordan domain @xmath9 which is _ not _ convex , there exists a homeomorphism @xmath12 such that the solution @xmath6 to ( [ main ] ) is _ not _ a homeomorphism .",
