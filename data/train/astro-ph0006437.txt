    "circular polarization observed in the radio emission from pulsars and quasars is not understood .",
    "although the emission mechanisms for these two classes of source are quite different , both have the common feature that the emission is due to highly relativistic particles in a magnetic field , for which the polarization should be predominantly linear with a circular component of order the inverse of the lorentz factor of the radiating particles . as discussed further below , this intrinsic component of circular polarization does not account for the observations .",
    "we propose that the circular polarization is imposed as a propagation effect , due the scintillations in the interstellar medium @xcite which account well for many of the observed , and otherwise unexplained , time variations in pulsars and quasars @xcite . the underlying physics for this alternative explanation is presented in this paper .",
    "we propose to discuss the details of the astrophysical applications elsewhere .",
    "scintillations are attributed to scattering of the radio waves off density inhomogeneities associated with turbulence in the ism .",
    "the data indicate a power - law model for the turbulence , with the power - law index consistent with the kolmogorov value ( @xmath0 in the notation used here ) @xcite .",
    "the dataset on pulsars is sufficiently large to allow mapping of the turbulence across the galaxy @xcite , implying much stronger scattering at low galactic latitudes , where most pulsars are observed , than at high galactic latitudes , where most quasars are observed .",
    "a planar wavefront becomes rippled as it traverses the region of turbulence .",
    "two length scales play a central role in the theory : the fresnel scale , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the wavelength of the radio wave and @xmath3 is the distance between the observer and the scattering region , and the diffractive scale , @xmath4 , over which the fluctuations in the phase decorrelate due to the turbulence .",
    "physically , @xmath4 characterizes the sizes of the ripples , and @xmath5 characterizes the size of the coherent patch an observer can see on the unrippled wavefront when only the geometric phase difference is taken into account .",
    "`` weak scattering '' corresponds to @xmath6 , when an observer sees a single coherent patch that is slightly tilted ( image displacement ) and slightly convex ( focussed ) or concave ( defocussed ) .",
    "`` strong scattering '' corresponds to @xmath7 , when an observer sees many coherent patches of size @xmath4 within an envelope of size @xmath8 , and multipath propagation occurs @xcite .",
    "intensity variations in strong scattering are induced by both diffractive effects , due to interference between the coherent patches , and refractive effects , caused by focussing ( defocussing ) of the ray bundle due to phase curvature across the scattering disk .",
    "there is a transition between strong scattering at lower frequencies and weak scattering at higher frequencies . for most pulsars",
    "the transition frequency is higher than the frequencies for which data are available , and for quasars the observations span the expected transition frequency , @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "inclusion of the interstellar magnetic field implies that the ism is birefringent , and propagation of radiation depends upon its polarization . in a homogeneous birefringent medium",
    ", radiation separates into the two oppositely polarized natural wave modes , with the phase difference between them increasing linearly with propagation distance .",
    "the two wavefronts corresponding to the two modes become systematically displaced from each other with increasing distance .",
    "the natural modes in the ism are circularly polarized to an excellent approximation , and the birefringence results in faraday rotation of the plane of linear polarization of any incident radiation .",
    "the amount of faraday rotation is parametrized in terms of the rotation measure , rm , which is defined such that the phase difference between the two modes is rm@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneity combined with birefringence implies that the wavefronts are both rippled and displaced from each other .",
    "one implication is that when the wavefronts are recombined there is a random component in the phase difference , and the resulting stochastic faraday rotation is characterized by a variance in rm @xcite .",
    "the main point made in the present paper is that scattering in the magnetized ism necessarily leads to a component of circular polarization ( cp ) in the observed radiation .",
    "this arises because any lateral displacement of the wavefront implies that the ripples are not superimposed when the two wavefronts are combined . as a result , there are alternative patches of excess right hand ( rh ) and excess left hand ( lh ) circular polarization on the image in the observer s plane . in this paper",
    "we present a detailed theory for such scintillation - induced cp .",
    "we argue that the predicted features of the cp are sufficiently promising to warrant the development of detailed models for the observed cp in pulsars and quasars based on it .",
    "cp is observed in both pulsars @xcite and in some compact extragalactic sources @xcite .",
    "most of the data on pulsars are integrated over many pulses , and the integrated pulse profile typically shows relatively small cp .",
    "however , there is evidence that in at least a few pulsars for which individual pulses can be studied , the cp is relatively large in individual pulses and varies from pulse to pulse such that the integrated value is much smaller than the typical value .",
    "there is no satisfactory explanation for the cp @xcite .",
    "a small ( @xmath11% to a few % ) but significant degree of cp is observed in some compact extragalactic sources @xcite .",
    "the suggested interpretations include the intrinsic polarization associated with synchrotron radiation @xcite , and partial conversion of linear into circular polarization due to ellipticity of the natural wave modes of the cold background plasma @xcite or of the relativistic electron gas itself @xcite .",
    "however none of these suggested interpretations has proved satisfactory in accounting for ( a ) the frequency dependence , ( b ) the temporal variations , and ( c ) the magnitude of the observed circular polarization @xcite .",
    "the explanation proposed in this paper is as outlined above .",
    "specifically , for a source with zero intrinsic cp seen through a turbulent magnetized plasma , there is a variable cp which corresponds to a zero average of the stokes parameter @xmath12 , @xmath13 , but a nonzero variance , @xmath14 .",
    "our initial objective is to use the theory of scintillations in a magnetized plasma @xcite to calculate @xmath15 .",
    "the magnitude of the expected value of cp needs to be of the same order of magnitude as the observed cp for the theory proposed here to be relevant . for pulsars ,",
    "the cp can be several tens of percent , but it may be that some of this cp results from birefringence in the pulsar magnetosphere itself , which we do not consider in detail here .",
    "for the most extreme case for quasars , the observed cp can be several percent , which is relatively high because there is independent evidence suggesting that the varying ( scintillating in our interpretation ) part of the source is only a modest fraction of the entire source .",
    "hence , the observations , in the most extreme cases , suggest that the cp of the scintillating component can be as high as a few tens of percent . in the theory developed here ,",
    "most of the terms that contribute to the cp are very small , of order the ratio of the cyclotron frequency in the ism to the radio frequency ( typically @xmath16 ) , and can be of no practical interest",
    ". however , the effect on which we concentrate can give arbitrarily high cp .",
    "this effect is due to birefringent refraction causing an angular separation between the emerging rays in the lh and rh polarized wave modes .",
    "the displacement of the centroids of the lh and rh images increases linearly with the distance from the screen where the birefringent refraction occurs .",
    "it is possible for the lh and rh images not to overlap , resulting in patches of 100% cp . the angular deviation required to produce relatively large cp",
    "is determined by the ratio of the characteristic size of the scintillation pattern divided by the distance between the observer and the screen where the birefringent refraction occurs .",
    "although the angular separation between the rays is always extremely small , we argue elsewhere@xcite that observed gradients in rm imply birefringent refraction through a sufficiently large angle to satisfy the criterion that observable cp be produced .",
    "our specific assumptions are explained in  2 , where the wave equation is reduced to the form used in treating the scattering .",
    "the mutual coherence of a polarized wavefield is derived in  3 , and is shown to reproduce some known results @xcite . in ",
    "4 the second - order correlations of the stokes parameters are derived from the fourth - order moment of the wavefield , and explicit solutions are obtained in the thin - screen approximation . in  5 we discuss scintillation - induced cp .",
    "the conclusions are presented in  6 .",
    "in this section the propagation of radiation through a magnetized stochastic medium is related to its effect upon the electric field of the wave .",
    "we start with propagation through a homogeneous weakly anisotropic medium and then generalize to include the effect of inhomogeneities in the scattering medium . for a weakly inhomogeneous medium",
    "the two wave modes are assumed to be transverse to a zeroth approximation ( the isotropic limit ) and the degeneracy between the two transverse states of polarization is broken by the weak anisotropy , to a first approximation . in the first approximation the two modes",
    "have slightly different refractive indices , and this approximation suffices to treat faraday rotation and all the effects of interest here .",
