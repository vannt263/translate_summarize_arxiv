    "one of the most enduring problems in our understanding of cosmological structure formation is the missing baryon problem  after summing up the known mass in the form of stars , interstellar material , hot ( x - ray emitting ) intragalactic medium in clusters , and observed intergalactic gas , a large portion of the expected baryonic mass is still missing ( fukugita , hogan , & peebles 1998 ; bregman 2007 ) .",
    "theoretically , these missing baryons are believed to reside primarily in the so - called warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) at moderate overdensity ( cen & ostriker 1999 , 2006 ) , heated to temperatures of @xmath4 k by adiabatic compression and shocks during formation of clusters / galaxies via a hierarchical sequence of mergers and accretion of smaller systems ( e.g. , vazza et al .",
    "observationally , the baryon fraction of the total gravitational mass in the inner region of a typical cluster ( @xmath5 , within which the mean mass density is 500 times the critical density of the universe ) , for example , has been shown to be substantially smaller than the universal value as expected from the standard cosmology ( andreon 2010 ; gonzalez et al .",
    "2013 ) ; this missing baryon problem is most convincing observed in relatively low- and intermediate - mass clusters ( @xmath6 ; lagan et al .",
    "similar conclusions have also been drawn for the baryon fraction in individual galaxies ( mcgaugh et al .",
    "2010 ; werk et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "on one hand , x - ray emission is routinely observed in the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) , mostly from inner regions ( @xmath7 ) , and recently from outer regions of rich clusters ( @xmath8 ) as well ( bonamente et al . 2012 ; eckert et al .",
    "2012 ; walker et al .",
    "2013 ; wang & walker 2014 ) .",
    "these observations characterize the gravitational mass and dynamic state , as well as the hot icm properties of an individual cluster , by measuring its x - ray temperature , morphology and structure .",
    "the non - homogeneous or multi - temperature ( or even multiphase ) nature of the icm is inferred , especially for the outer regions , and is indeed expected from simulations and theoretical models of the structure formation ( roncarelli et al .",
    "2006 , molnar et al .",
    "these simulations and models show a complicated shock heating / cooling history of the icm in the outer regions and beyond ( up to @xmath9 , where the strong external shock of the accretion flow is located , while the virial radius is typically located at @xmath10 ; molnar et al .",
    "in addition , the cluster environment can strongly affect the gaseous halos of individual galaxies , via processes such as ram - pressure stripping and pressure compression ( e.g. , lu & wang 2011 ) .",
    "on the other hand , observations of uv absorption lines from warm gas along the sight - lines toward background qsos have shown a significant reservoir of baryonic matter in the outskirts of galaxies on scales of their virial radii .",
    "for example , ly-@xmath11 and/or o vi absorbers are often found to be around individual galaxies of luminosities @xmath12 to @xmath13 kpc with a high covering factor of @xmath14 for blue , star - forming galaxies and a substantially lower covering factor for red , passive galaxies ( prochaska et al .",
    "2011 ; tumlinson et al . 2011a , 2013 ) .",
    "occasionally , such absorbers are also observed to much greater distances ( @xmath15 mpc ) away from field galaxies .",
    "the exact nature of such absorbers ( e.g , collisional ionization vs. photoionization for o vi - bearing gas ) remains uncertain ( e.g. , oppenheimer & schaye 2013 ) .",
    "so far only a handful of sight - lines have been probed for the icm or intragroup medium via far - uv ( fuv ) absorption lines .",
    "nevertheless , sight - lines to several nearby groups of galaxies clearly show absorption lines in the intragroup medium , with definite signals of a multiphase plasma as lines arising from species of very different ionization states ( such as c iii and o vi are present for same absorbers ; shull , tumlinson & giroux 2003 ; pisano et al .",
    "2004 ; tripp et al . 2011 ; tumlinson et al .",
    "2011b ; muzahid et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "the fortuitous alignment of uv - bright background qsos behind x - ray emitting foreground clusters provides a unique opportunity to probe the mass content and physical conditions of the multiphase icm . with suitable cluster / qso pairs",
    ", the hot cluster gas can be sensitively studied with x - ray emission diagnostics while the  warm - hot \" icm can be probed with ultraviolet absorption lines imprinted on the spectrum of the background qso .",
    "such pairs provide a laboratory to examine the physical processes of the icm , freshly accreted from the intergalactic medium and/or stripped out of individual galaxies , as well as the gaseous halos of individual cluster galaxies . clearly , the understanding of these phenomena and physical processes is important not only for studying the environmental impact on galaxy evolution and for determining the baryon content and physical / dynamic state of the clusters , but for their utility as cosmology probes as well ( e.g. , via the observed sunyaev - zeldovich effect signal ; carlstrom , holder & reese 2002 ) .",
    "we have started a program to use cluster / qso pairs to examine the multiphase intracluster medium in and around cluster galaxies using _ xmm - newton_/_chandra _ and the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "an important factor in the selection of the background qsos is that the fuv and near - uv ( nuv ) fluxes have been accurately measured .",
    "although most qsos by nature are uv bright in the rest frame , the probability of intersecting a lyman limit system ( log@xmath16 17.2 ) , which effectively blocks all radiation below ( 1 + @xmath17)@xmath18912  , increases with redshift .",
    "hence , not all qsos with @xmath19 are suitable for this work .",
    "we cross - reference the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) dr7 quasar catalog with the _ galex _ all - sky survey data to select targets that have reliable fuv and nuv flux measurements .",
    "similarly , not all clusters are suited for absorption studies with _ hst_/cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) .",
    "the o vi doublet ( 1032 and 1038  ) , in particular , is not redshifted into an observable region below @xmath20 . below these redshifts ,",
    "the sensitivity of cos declines , and the absorption from h@xmath21 in the milky way can impede detection and measurement of weak o vi lines . thus we cross - correlate our list of uv bright qsos with the sdss gmbcg catalog ( hao et al . 2010 ) , consisting of over 55,000 clusters , to search for proper z@xmath22 0.10 targets . for an optimal use of the _ xmm - newton _ and _ hst _ observing time , we select only those relatively rich clusters with the temperatures @xmath23 2 kev and 0.10 @xmath24 0.25 paired with background qsos of @xmath25 18.3 and projected distances @xmath26 .",
    "the projected distances all lie well within the external accretion shock radii expected for the clusters ( e.g. , molnar et al .",
    "in addition , we check to see if the o vi lines would lie near lines from the milky way interstellar medium ( ism ) to ensure that there is no blending with ism lines . in total , we have identified 10 potential targets .",
    "two of these targets , a1095 and a1926 , have been observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _ and _ hst _ for our program .    here",
    ", we present a study of these two clusters based primarily on our _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "the rest of the present paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the _ xmm - newton _ observations and our data reduction and analysis procedures ; section 3 presents the results based on the x - ray observations ; section 4 compares multi - wavelength observations to further the exploration of the clusters , including their dynamic state , substructure , large - scale environment , and baryon content , as well as implication of our findings ; section 5 summarizes our results and conclusions .",

    "this is a strong indication for the presence of substantial substructure in the icm distribution of a1095w .",
    "the presence of such substructure leads to an effective increase of the core radius and a steep drop in the outer part of the profile , which is reflected in a large fitted @xmath41 value ( jones & forman 1999 ) .",

    "these facts may indicate that the cluster is being assembled gently ( i.e. , not via a major merger ) , which is consistent with its flat radial temperature structure ( fig .",
