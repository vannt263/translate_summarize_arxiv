    "hence , the replicas are not able to establish the @xmath87 vbc structure , even though they tunnel repeatedly throughout the extended parameter range . these observations are consistent with a first - order quantum phase transition between the neighboring vbc phases .",
    "however , one might be concerned , that the numerical difficulties could hide an intermediate phase that separates the vbc phases .",
    "in one such scenario , an intermediate phase is not commensurate with our lattice sizes .",
    "when simulating lattices of varying sizes ( @xmath50=12 , 24 , 25 , 36 ) , we did however not detect any new structures in the transition regime .",
    "of course , we can not exclude phases with very large unit cells from our finite size study .",
    "another possibility would be a superfluid or even supersolid phase in the intermediate region , such as observed in a similar model on the square lattice  @xcite .",
    "however , we can rule out a finite superfluid density in the transition region : using quantum parallel tempering in @xmath24 or driving a superfluid system ( from large @xmath118 ) towards the transition region at low @xmath16 , resulted in @xmath34 always becoming zero for values of @xmath119 . a third possibility for an intermediate phase would be a vbc `` emulsion '' i.e. , a metastable phase mixture with domain walls separating @xmath63 and @xmath26 vbc - like domains .",
    "while we observe in the qmc simulations bosonic structures that show features of both the @xmath63 and the @xmath26 phase , which would be expected from such an vbc `` emulsion '' scenario , these structures are also consistent with a first - order transition , given the algorithmic metastability .",
    "thus , we consider a first - order vbc - vbc quantum phase transition the most conservative scenario consistent with the qmc data and the apparent difficulty of the qmc algorithm in this parameter regime .",
    "while we can not determine the precise location of the quantum phase transition , we take the peak position of the compressibility as an estimate .",
    "this is reflected in the phase diagram in : the points denote the region where the phase transition occurs according to our estimate .",
