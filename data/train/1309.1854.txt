    "the discovery of compact stellar objects , such as x - ray pulsars , namely her x1 , millisecond pulsar sax j1808.43658 , x - ray sources 4u 1820 - 30 and 4u 1728 - 34 which are regarded as the probable strange star candidates , has led to critical studies of relativistic models of such stellar configurations [ 1 - 10 ] .",
    "there are several such astrophysical as well as cosmological situations where one needs to consider the equation of state of matter involving matter densities of the order of @xmath4 or higher , exceeding the nuclear density .",
    "the conventional approach of obtaining models of relativistic stars in equilibirium heavily relies on the availibility of definite information about the equation of state of its matter content .",
    "our knowledge about possible equation of state inside a superdense strange star at present is not known . in this context vaidya - tikekar @xcite and",
    "tikekar @xcite have shown that in the absence of definite information about equation of state of matter content of stellar configuration , the alternative approach of prescribing suitable _ ansatz _ geometry for the interior physical 3-space of the configuration leads to simple easily tractable models of such stars which are physically viable .",
    "relativistic models of superdense stars based on different solutions of einstein s field equations obtained by using vaidya - tikekar approach of assigning different geometries with physical 3-spaces of such objects have been studied by several workers @xcite .",
    "pant and sah @xcite obtained a class of relativistic static non - singular analytic solutions in isotropic form describing space time of static spherically symmetric distribution of matter .",
    "the solution has been found to lead to a physically viable causal model of neutron star with a maximum mass @xmath5 .    in this paper",
    "we discuss a class of solution of relativistic field equations as obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and examine physical plausibility of several models of a class of neutron stars using numerical procedures to explore the possibility of using it to describe interior of a compact star .",
    "it is also possible to estimate the radius of a star when its mass is known .",
    "it is also possible to determine the variation of matter density on its boundary surface and that at the center of a superdense star for the prescribed geometry .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in sec 2 .",
    "the relevant relativistic field equations have been set up and their solution is discussed . in sec 3 .",
    "several features of physical relevance have been reported . in sec . 4 ,",
    "stellar models are discussed with the observational stellar mass data for different values of the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "finally in sec 5 , we give a brief discussion .",
    "the einstein s field equation is @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath3 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the metric tensor , ricci scalar , ricci tensor and energy momentum tensor respectively .",
    "we use the following form of the space time metric given by @xmath10 with @xmath11 using isotropic spherical polar coordinate . in the next section",

    "using the space time metric given by eq.(2 ) , the einstein s field eq .",
    "( 1 ) gives the following equations : @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 now , pressure isotropy condition from eqs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) leads to the following relation between metric variables @xmath20 and @xmath21 : @xmath22 it is a second order differential equation which permits a solution @xcite as follows : @xmath23 where @xmath3 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are arbitrary constants . in the above",
    "we denote @xmath24 we observe that the geometry of that of the 3-space with metric @xmath25 is that of a 3 sphere immersed in a 4-dimensional euclidean space . accordingly",
    "the geometry of physical space obtained at the @xmath26 section of the space time is given by @xmath27 where , @xmath28 is given by eq.(10 ) .",
    "hence the geometry of the 3 space obtained at @xmath26 section of the space time of metric ( 12 ) is a deviation introduced in spherical 3 space and the parameter @xmath1 is a geometrical parameter measuring inhomogenity of the physical space . with @xmath29 ,",
    "the space time metric ( 12 ) degenerates into that of einstein s static universe which is filled with matter of uniform density .",
    "the space time metric of pant and sah @xcite is a generalization of the buchdahl solution , the physical 3-space associated with which has the same feature . for @xmath30 ,",
    "the solution reduces to that obtained by buchdahl which is an analog of a classical polytrope of index 5 .",

    "we note that @xmath15 is obviously positive for any positive @xmath0 and @xmath1 , while @xmath39 leads to two different cases : ( i ) @xmath40 with @xmath41 and ( ii ) @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
