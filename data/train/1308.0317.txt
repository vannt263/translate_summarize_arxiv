    "our model is defined by eq [ act2 ] , @xmath53 , \\ ] ] with notation as explained in the main text . for technical reasons",
    "we will set @xmath54 , forbidding explicit auto  regulation @xcite .",
    "we will continue to group the parameters of the network into the topology @xmath55 and the weights @xmath56 .    to formally define the weighting sectors , we first notice that the @xmath57 term in eq can be seen as an additional input from a constitutively expressed repressor ( if @xmath58 ) or activator ( if @xmath59 ) , so we can think of input weights and the activation threshold in a unified way .",
    "mathematically , we then have the following structure .",
    "consider a network with a specified weighting , and a given configuration of node states @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "each link @xmath62 in the network is either satisfied or frustrated ; the `` frustration state '' of a link will be denoted as @xmath63 and takes a binary value , @xmath64 . interpreting activation thresholds as constitutive activation or repression by a `` virtual '' node",
    ", the corresponding `` virtual '' link can also be satisfied or frustrated ( the virtual link is satisfied for a constitutively activated node ( @xmath65 ) that is _ on _ or a constitutively repressed node ( @xmath66 ) that is _ off _ ) . for the rest of the appendices , we will treat internal thresholds as weights of these additional `` virtual '' interactions , considering @xmath33 as part of an extended matrix @xmath67 ; we will use the tilde as a reminder that the internal thresholds are treated as weights of additional links .",
    "a `` weighting sector '' is a map that determines whether a particular combination of satisfied / frustrated input links is consistent with eq .",
    "the full parameter space is a direct product of the parameter spaces describing individual nodes , so to simplify notation , let us focus on one node @xmath68",
    ". denote @xmath69 the complete set of its inputs ( genes that regulate @xmath68 , as well as the internal threshold ) , and @xmath70 their number : @xmath71 where @xmath72 expands @xmath73 to include the connections to virtual nodes that model the threshold .",
    "now , let @xmath74 and @xmath75 be the @xmath76-element vectors of strengths and signs of the interactions regulating gene @xmath68 ( the incoming links ) : @xmath77",
    "for a fixed topology @xmath75 , the incoming weights @xmath74 at node @xmath68 define a boolean function of @xmath70 arguments @xmath78 : @xmath79 this function has the following interpretation : when applied to the set @xmath80 , it tells us if this combination of satisfied / frustrated links is allowed by the regulatory rule at node @xmath68 . note that this is _ not _",
    "the function that maps the states of input nodes into the state of the target node ( the input / output function ) ; using @xmath81 allows us to exhibit the symmetry between all @xmath70 inputs , whereas the input - output function must treat the internal threshold separately .    a `` weighting sector '' at node",
    "@xmath68 is the equivalence class of vectors @xmath74 that define the same boolean function @xmath82 .",
    "the set of possible boolean functions , which is much smaller than the set of all possible boolean functions @xcite , describes the full set of weighting sectors .    for a graph with in ",
    "degree @xmath83 , each node has three input links ( two regulatory links from other nodes and the constitutive activation / repression ) , and there is a total of 4 weighting sectors described in the main text ( fig .",
    "[ fig : weightsectors]b ) .",
    "three of these sectors correspond to a combination of weights when one link is stronger than the other two put together , e.g. @xmath84 .",
    "we call these sectors `` dominating '' . the three boolean functions of dominating sectors @xmath85 , @xmath86 are given by @xmath87",
    ". the boolean function of the unique non  dominating sector is given by @xmath88 for a node with weights of incoming links drawn from this sector , eq is satisfied whenever any two of the links are satisfied .    for reasons that will be explained shortly , in this work , we consider graphs of topological in  degree @xmath89 , which means we have 4 controlling links per node . in this case",
    "there are exactly 12 weighting sectors , summarized in table  [ tbl:12sec ] : 4 cases with a single `` dominating '' link ( one weight is stronger than all others put together , so the state of this one link defines whether the whole configuration is allowed or not ) , 4 `` sub - dominating '' ( the strongest link and any other must be satisfied , or all three weakest ) and 4 `` combinatorial '' ( any pair from a given set of three should be satisfied ) .    .weighting sectors for in  degree @xmath89 . [ cols=\"<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      to determine the distribution of complexity @xmath22 over weightings @xmath42 , we perform a recursive tree search by sequentially fixing weight sector choices at every node and calculating , at every step , which subset of the list of potential solutions is compatible with the partially fixed weight sector sequence .",
    "the factorization property mentioned above ensures that when choosing a sector at each new node , the list of compatible solutions can only shrink .",
    "we can thus perform a targeted search aimed at identifying high - complexity weightings : if we discover early on that the total number of potentially compatible solutions falls below a certain threshold , we can drop the entire subtree of weightings described by the partial specification , and move on .",
    "since most weightings have in fact very few solutions , this allows to exactly enumerate _ all _ weightings of complexities exceeding a fixed threshold , while still keeping computation time low . if the `` drop - out '' threshold",
    "is set to zero , the entire distribution is calculated exactly , and the computation time is still considerably lower than the brute - force enumeration of weightings , taking on the order of a minute on a modern desktop computer for @xmath90 .",
    "the high - complexity tails can be readily studied up to @xmath51 .    to obtain an approximate distribution of solution counts over all weightings for @xmath91 - 10 , when full weighting enumeration is not feasible , we first run a targeted search for high - complexity weightings as described above .",
    "we then sample a large number of weightings ( e.g. , @xmath92 ) at random and stitch the resulting distribution of low - complexity weightings with the already calculated exact tail of the distribution .",
    "this procedure gives excellent agreement for graphs with @xmath93 where a full distribution can be calculated exactly .",
    "the average complexity over all weightings @xmath94 for a given topology @xmath95 can be determined without calculating the entire distribution of solution counts by using the following trick .",
    "notice that the average number of solutions is equal to @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the number of all possible weightings @xmath42 , and @xmath98 is the total number of pairs @xmath99 , where the state vector @xmath100 is a solution of the network @xmath101 . to calculate @xmath102 , rather than summing the number of solutions for each weighting @xmath42 , we will sum , for all states @xmath100 , the number @xmath103 of weightings compatible with that state : @xmath104 to calculate @xmath103 we use the factorization property mentioned above and the table  [ tbl : iwccompatibility ] : @xmath105,\\label{eq : ns}\\ ] ] where @xmath106 denotes , as before , the frustrated / satisfied state of link @xmath107 , and @xmath108 is the number of weighting sectors compatible with a given pattern of incoming link states ( see table  [ tbl : iwccompatibility ] ) .",
    "this trick allows us to rapidly calculate the exact value of typical complexity of graphs up to about @xmath109 , and eliminates the need to loop over the weightings themselves , a prohibitively large space for large values of @xmath29 .    for a large @xmath29",
    ", we can also estimate the average complexity @xmath110 by making a mean - field approximation in  . for a given node @xmath0 in the network ,",
    "each of the incoming links has equal probability of being satisfied and frustrated .",
    "therefore , table  [ tbl : iwccompatibility ] ( after excluding the dominating sectors ) tells us that the number of allowed weighting sectors at a randomly selected node is a random variable @xmath111 , drawn from a distribution @xmath112 : @xmath113 in the mean  field approximation , we can take this to hold independently for each node in the graph , so @xmath114 where @xmath115 are random variables drawn from @xmath112 .",
    "we note that every term in the sum has probability @xmath116 to be nonzero , and nonzero terms can be rewritten in terms of a new random variable @xmath117 drawn from @xmath118 , i.e. from distirbution @xmath112 conditioned on positivity constraint .",
    "we conclude that @xmath119 where @xmath120 is suspiciously close to @xmath39 .",
    "this result can be understood in more general terms .",
    "a network in our model is a system of @xmath29 binary variables , constrained with @xmath29 binary equations , each forbidding exactly half of the configuration space .",
    "one therefore expects , on average , a number of solutions of order @xmath121 , irrespectively of @xmath29 .",
    "note that this argument is very general and requires neither the assumption of a constant in  degree nor the fact that genes are modeled as binary variables ; it relies only on the fact that the input - output function at each node maps each sets of inputs into exactly one output .",
    "the slight difference between the @xmath122 of the mean - field calculation and @xmath39 comes from the weak convexity of the logarithm and is most likely within the error of the mean - field approximation .",
    "this simple argument shows that for random ( uniformly sampled ) topologies the average complexity is not expected to increase with @xmath29 .",
    "while a large network is in principle capable of storing many patterns ( and this can indeed be aided by a biased choice of topology ) , achieving high complexity requires a careful adjustment of weights .",
    "we would like to contrast this result with the fact that spin glasses can have exponentially many locally stable states @xcite .",
    "the apparent contradiction comes from the fact that the ground state of a spin glass is not required to satisfy every single node ; a ground state only minimizes the frustration in the entire system . in particular",
    ", a ground state always exists , in contrast to a `` solution '' of a network in the sense we consider here .",
    "previous sections discussed techniques to find , for a fixed topology @xmath95 , the distribution of available complexities @xmath22 and the optimal weightings that maximize it .",
    "another relevant question to ask is which topologies @xmath123 achieve the highest complexity , either on average @xmath124 or after optimization of weights @xmath125 .",
    "finding these topologies becomes particularly important when we realize that disconnected graphs may have a high number of solutions without being truly complex in information - processing sense described in the main text ( when the network is seen as performing a mapping between a subset of nodes designated as `` input '' and the rest of the nodes , the `` output '' ) .",
    "for example , a disconnected network consisting of @xmath47 mutually repressing pairs of nodes has @xmath126 nodes and can have @xmath127 solutions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram]a ) . in the space of all @xmath29-node graphs ,",
    "disconnected topologies are exponentially rare .",
    "therefore , we do not expect disconnected topologies to significantly affect statistical properties , such as average complexity values of all topologies with a fixed @xmath29 . however , to be able to interpret our results , we need to ensure that the highest - complexity networks identified by our measure are not pathological in this manner .",
    "luckily , the highest - capacity graphs are in fact connected and their capacity exceeds @xmath128 : storing patterns in a network in a distributed way is more efficient than splitting it into many disconnected components . to see this ,",
    "we need a method to perform a targeted search for high - complexity topologies . indeed , for @xmath129 , there are too many topologies to be sampled exhaustively , and probing tails of heavy - tailed distributions by random sampling",
    "is extremely inefficient .    to solve this problem",
    ", we used the empirical observation that high - complexity topologies are enriched in mutual - repression motifs ( compare fig .  [",
    "fig : n6 ] , panels a , b and c ) .",
    "the reason for this becomes clear if we recall the mean - field argument we used to calculate the expected number of solutions of a graph .",
    "the mean - field approximation assumes , for all links , equal probability of being satisfied or frustrated . in an mutual repression motif ,",
    "however , the two links are always either both satisfied , or both frustrated . in a topology enriched in mutually repressing pairs , every time a node is satisfied ( i.e. has a sufficient number of satisfied incoming links ) , this increases the probability of their neighbors to be satisfied as well ; consequently , such topologies tend to have weightings with larger number of solutions . by sampling only topologies",
    "whose @xmath7 matrix ( no tilde ! ) is close to symmetric , we frequently find graphs with complexities far above average .",
    "the best networks found in this way have complexity 27 for @xmath44 and 54 for @xmath51 , all confidently above @xmath128 .",
    "the highest complexity achievable for a given @xmath29 may be higher still , demonstrating that the highest capacity networks are not trivially so .",
    "we stress that the fact that symmetric @xmath7 matrices lead to higher complexity values is a consequence of our simplifying choice to only consider repressing interactions .",
    "allowing interactions to be both repressing and activating will remove this special structure .",
    "another approach to deal with pathological cases such as fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram]a is to redefine the complexity measure in a way that does not see such graphs as complex .",
    "we will now construct an improved definition of network complexity that quantifies complexity as the diversity of causal relations across the set of solutions .",
    "let us explain what we mean by this , and show that this definition , first , correctly handles pathological cases of disconnected topology , and second , for connected graphs is in excellent agreement with the more simple complexity measure we used in the main text .",
    "we begin with an example .",
    "compare two situations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram]b ,  c ) : in the first , gene @xmath130 is directly regulated by @xmath131 , so they are both `` on '' or both `` off '' . in the second",
    ", gene @xmath130 can be activated by either of its two inputs @xmath131 or @xmath132 , so we can have @xmath130 `` on '' because @xmath131 is `` on '' , or because @xmath132 is `` on '' .",
    "imagine that @xmath131 and @xmath132 are embedded in the network in such a way that they can not both be active ( shown as mutual repression on fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram]c ) . in this case",
    "both networks have two states , but the regulation of @xmath130 can be described as more `` complex '' in the second case , because the causal relations are more diverse .    to formalize the intuition gained from this example ,",
    "we first introduce the notion of an `` active link '' .",
    "define a satisfied link to be _ active _ if its satisfied state is essential for the regulatory rule   to be satisfied .",
    "in other words , for a given solution @xmath23 , a link @xmath133 is `` active '' if and only if substitution @xmath134 upsets equation   at node @xmath68 .",
    "( clearly , frustrated links can never be active ) .",
    "loosely speaking , an active link is `` responsible '' for setting the state of the node @xmath68 .",
    "each solution @xmath100 of a network @xmath101 defines a pattern of active links @xmath135 : a binary sequence specifying , for every link @xmath136 , whether it is active ( @xmath137 ) or not ( @xmath138 ) . for example , a `` dominating '' link is always the unique active input at the node it regulates , for any solution . for other combinations of link weights",
    ", we can have zero , one or more input links active simultaneously , and this pattern will vary from solution to solution .",
    "we now take a moment to define the second ingredient of our definition , the diversity of a set of binary sequences .",
    "given any two sequences , it is easy to define some measure of their difference ; we will use the hamming distance .",
    "how can we quantify the diversity of a _ set _ of sequences ? given a set of elements @xmath139 and a metric of pairwise distances between elements @xmath140 , we would like a reasonable measure of _ diversity _ @xmath141 to satisfy three properties :    1 .",
    "invariance under permutation : @xmath142 for any permutation @xmath143 .",
    "2 .   insensitivity to duplication of an element : @xmath144 .",
    "additivity : if all @xmath145 are pairwise equidistant , @xmath146 , then @xmath147 .",
    "a measure of diversity satisfying all these intuitive properties can be obtained by solving the traveling salesman problem ( tsp ) : @xmath148 is defined as the length of the shortest closed path passing once through each of the `` cities '' @xmath145 , with distances between cities being defined by the metric @xmath140 .",
    "we now have all the ingredients ready , and define the _ tsp complexity _ of a graph @xmath95 as the tsp diversity of active link patterns across the set of solutions of the network : @xmath149 .",
    "this improved definition naturally accounts for varying pairwise similarity between solutions .",
    "in particular , by focussing on the state of links rather than the nodes themselves , we correctly deal with `` simple '' graphs that may have many solutions : note , for instance , that all the solutions of the graph on fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram]a have the exact same pattern of active links , and thus the graph receives zero tsp complexity score despite its large capacity .    in figure",
    "[ fig : s2 ] we show the comparison between @xmath150 and @xmath22 , and we see that the agreement is quite good .",
    "pathological cases when capacity overestimates true complexity are rare , and are all located at intermediate capacity values , in the bulk of the distribution .",
    "therefore , once again , they neither alter the structure of the high  complexity tail nor affect statistical properties of the distribution significantly .",
    "this improved measure of complexity , however , is computationally hard to evaluate , and the computational `` tricks '' discussed above no longer apply .",
    "therefore , for the purposes of this work , we chose to use the simpler definition .",

    "<S> what we think of as the state of a living cell is determined largely by the concentrations of various proteins . </S>",

    "<S> thus , there is a network of interactions in which genes encode proteins , and proteins control the reading out of the genes . </S>",
    "<S> such `` genetic regulatory networks '' are not the whole story of how cells control their states , but this is a good starting point , and the image of cellular states as being the states of an interacting network certainly has shaped quite a bit of thinking about cellular function @xcite .    during embryonic development of multicellular organisms , the states of the relevant genetic networks are thought to encode the body plan of the adult @xcite , and so the ability of the network to adopt a richer set of states corresponds to building a more complex organism . </S>",
    "<S> what is it about the network that controls this complexity ? how do the changes in dna sequence allow the emergence of greater complexity over the course of evolutionary history @xcite ?    </S>",

    "<S> we see what happens when a mutation knocks out one element of the network . </S>",
    "<S> such experiments lead to information about the topology of the network : the protein encoded by gene a represses the read out of genes c , and , activates the read out of gene d , and does nothing to genes b and f. it is much more difficult to measure the strength of these interactions . perhaps because of this experimental situation , there has been a considerable focus on network topology itself as a determinant of biological function .    </S>",
    "<S> ideas about network topology include several themes . </S>",
    "<S> one approach aims at a statistical characterization of network topologies , focusing on the distribution of the number of connections to a single node ( degree distribution ) @xcite or the presence of local motifs in which patterns of connections among small numbers of genes are over  represented @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another idea is that relatively small changes in dna sequence in the regions where proteins bind and regulate the expression of genes can change the effective topology of the network , and thus there is a path for topology to evolve quickly , without changing the number or identity of genes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally there is the idea that the difficulty of defining interactions strengths is a problem not only for us but for the cell itself , and hence that important cellular functions must be `` robust '' against variations in these parameters , or equivalently against changes in the absolute numbers of all the relevant protein molecules @xcite ; taken literally , this means that function must be encoded in topology alone .    while the focus on network topology is widespread , there are alternatives . rather than being irrelevant </S>",
    "<S> , parameters could be optimized to transmit the maximum amount of information through a network @xcite , to achieve the maximum signal  to  noise ratio for weak signals @xcite , or to insure that events occur in a precisely timed sequence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental situation is challenging , but it ought to be possible to define a class of models within which the relative contributions of topology and parameters can be dissected completely .    to make the comparison of topology and interaction strengths a well posed problem </S>",
    "<S> , we have to address two issues . </S>",
    "<S> first , we have to say what we mean by complexity . </S>",
    "<S> second , we have to define a measure on the space of interaction strengths . the claim , for example , that `` typical '' parameter values lead to certain behaviors depends on the shape of the distribution over parameter space . since interactions are determined by the rates or equilibrium constants for biochemical reactions ( e.g. , binding of a protein to a site along the dna @xcite ) , </S>",
    "<S> these parameters are continuous and exponentially sensitive to perhaps more natural parameters such as binding energies ; the question of what constitutes a natural measure on such a space is not trivial .    </S>",
    "<S> here we introduce a highly simplified model in which these issues have a natural formulation , and in particular where the continuous parameter space breaks into discrete sectors with equal weight , so that varying parameters and varying topology both become matters of enumeration . within this model </S>",
    "<S> we will see that complexity is dominated by the choice of parameters , and that it is very difficult to evolve greater complexity by changing topology without optimizing parameters .    to make a simplified model </S>",
    "<S> , we imagine that every gene @xmath0 has a binary state , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 indicates that protein encoded by gene @xmath0 is being synthesized , and thus is present at a relatively high concentration , while @xmath3 indicates that this protein is at near zero concentration . </S>",
    "<S> the state is determined by inputs from other proteins , and we assume that these inputs add ; the gene is `` on '' if the total input exceeds a threshold : @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{act1}\\ ] ] the matrix @xmath5 encodes both the topology of the network and strength of the interactions . to separate these we write @xmath6 , where the elements of the topology matrix @xmath7 are assigned values @xmath8 , @xmath9 , or @xmath10 depending on whether the protein encoded by gene @xmath11 activates , represses , or does nothing to gene @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction matrix @xmath12 then can be assigned all positive elements . in a similar spirit </S>",
    "<S> , we write @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 ; @xmath16 means that gene @xmath0 would be `` on '' in the absence of inputs ( `` constitutively active , '' in biological terms ) , and conversely for @xmath17 . </S>",

    "<S> \\label{act2}\\ ] ] the network is defined by its topology @xmath19 and its continuous parameters or weightings @xmath20 .    </S>",
    "<S> a configuration of on / off states @xmath21 that satisfies eq ( [ act2 ] ) at every node will be called a _ solution _ of the network ; solutions describe configurations of static gene activity patterns within a single cell . </S>",
    "<S> their number may correspond , for example , to the number of cell types this network can encode during development , and so is a natural measure of network complexity . in the language of neural networks </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we can call it the _ capacity _ of the network , @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> it can also be thought of as a measure of information processing capability : for example , a network possessing just two solutions @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be seen as taking one input ( state of node @xmath25 ) and setting the state of other nodes to well  defined values that depend on this input , while a network with more solutions is capable of distinguishing more combinations of inputs and adjusting the outputs accordingly , and so performs a more complex computation . </S>",
    "<S> our task , then , is to compute @xmath22 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> although the parameters @xmath26 are continuous and , in principle , unbounded , if we are only interested in the _ solutions _ of the network , there is a natural compact geometry to the parameter space , and this geometry also breaks into discrete subspaces . to see this , </S>",
    "<S> let s denote by @xmath27 the vector of all parameters that `` feed '' into gene @xmath0 , @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> with @xmath29 genes , there are @xmath29 separate vectors @xmath27 , and together these vectors define the parameter space of the model . </S>",
    "<S> but eq ( [ act2 ] ) has a symmetry , where the states of the system are invariant under independent scaling of the parameters feeding into each node , @xmath30 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus we can choose @xmath31 for each gene @xmath0 , so that the relevant parameter space is a direct product of positive segments of unit spheres .    </S>",
    "<S> once we realize that the relevant parameter space is the portion of the unit sphere , there is a natural measure , namely the uniform distribution . </S>",
    "<S> but we can do more , because whole sectors of the parameter space produce the same solutions . </S>",
    "<S> we know this has to be true because eq ( [ act2 ] ) says that each node computes a boolean function of its inputs , and there is only a finite number of boolean functions with @xmath29 inputs . </S>",
    "<S> further , our model generates only a very small subset of these , the perceptrons @xcite .    in the simplest case , shown in fig [ fig : weightsectors]a , a gene @xmath0 receives input from one other gene ( with strength @xmath32 ) and compares this to a local threshold @xmath33 ; now the `` unit sphere '' is just a quarter circle . </S>",
    "<S> but if @xmath34 , then gene @xmath0 will have the same state , @xmath35 , no matter what the state of the input @xmath36 might be . on the other hand , if @xmath37 , then the state of gene @xmath0 is determined uniquely by the state of the input , @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> these sectors have the same weight under the uniform distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> the simplest two  dimensional case also alerts us to a problem , namely that some combinations of parameters are nt very interesting . in this case , there are two possibilities , and in one of them the gene @xmath0 is essentially uncoupled from the network . in the other case , gene @xmath0 is completely redundant with gene @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> somehow neither of these cases sounds much like a `` network . ''    </S>",
    "<S> the next simplest case is where gene @xmath0 takes two inputs and compares their sum to a threshold ( `` in degree ''  2 ) . now </S>",
    "<S> the vector @xmath27 is three dimensional , so that the relevant space is a segment of the familiar unit two  sphere embedded in three dimensions , shown in fig [ fig : weightsectors]b . again </S>",
    "<S> the continuous space breaks into discrete regions , and within each region the solutions of the network are the same . there are four regions , and three of them are uninteresting in the same way that we saw for the two dimensional case . in one sector , the state of gene @xmath0 is dominated by the threshold @xmath33 , and so this node is effectively not attached to the network , since its state is independent of the state of all other nodes . in two other sectors , one of the interactions @xmath12 is so large that it dominates all other inputs , and hence gene @xmath0 is completely redundant with one other gene @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> it is only in the remaining fourth sector where the state of gene @xmath0 depends in a nontrivial way on the combination of its inputs .    </S>",
    "<S> the picture of dominating sectors in fig [ fig : weightsectors]b  regions of parameter space where a single input dominates , so that one node becomes either decoupled from the network or completely redundant with one other node  is the quantitative expression of the intuition that making interactions continuously weaker is not obviously separable from changing topology by erasing these interactions altogether . in the dominating sectors , </S>",
    "<S> interactions can be erased without changing the set of solutions in the network . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> parameter settings in such dominating sectors are functionally equivalent to networks with simpler topology ( fewer connections ) , and so if we want to compare the role of continuous parameters to that of network topology , we should exclude these regions of parameter space ( see also appendix [ app : iwcsectors ] ) .    with three inputs to each node , </S>",
    "<S> the vector @xmath27 is four dimensional , and there are twelve discrete sectors of the sphere that generate different solutions . </S>",
    "<S> four of these have a single dominating weight , and thus will be excluded . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining eight sectors have equal probability under the uniform distribution on the sphere ( appendix [ app : iwcvolumes ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if we consider networks in which each gene is influenced by three inputs , there are @xmath40 distinct networks for a given topology , and we can do exhaustive enumerations up to values of @xmath29 that are typical of real genetic networks . </S>",
    "<S> already with four inputs there are @xmath41 networks for each topology , so we will confine our attention to the case of three inputs .    </S>",
    "<S> let us start with @xmath29 genes connected in a particular topology , and then choose parameters at random from the @xmath40 sectors described above . </S>",
    "<S> for each network we can measure the capacity , or number of distinct solutions to eq ( [ act2 ] ) , and then average over parameters at fixed topology . in fig [ fig : changen ] we show the distribution of this mean complexity across topologies in which all @xmath29 genes are repressors . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , the average complexity is independent of @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> this may appear counterintuitive : we expect larger graphs to be capable of storing more patterns , but they also have more weightings with few or no solutions . </S>",
    "<S> this result can be demonstrated analytically with a mean - field argument that holds independently of our simplifying assumptions such as constant in  degree ( see appendix [ app : computation ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it shows that , quite generally , a larger network is not automatically more complex ; rather , it has the potential for high complexity , but only realizes this potential with a careful choice of weights .    to highlight the difference between average and attainable complexity , we calculate , for a given topology , the distribution of @xmath22 over all weightings @xmath42 . for @xmath43 we can enumerate all topologies ; figure  [ fig : n6 ] shows three examples with the lowest , typical and highest average complexity , and the corresponding distributions . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the distributions overlap considerably , and the typical realizations of even the best topology are routinely outperformed by `` lesser '' topologies when their weights are optimized . </S>",
    "<S> this persists for larger @xmath29 : the best @xmath44 topology found by a targeted search has average complexity @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> this is far in the tail of the distribution : uniform sampling of 1000 topologies gives an average complexity of only @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> however , optimizing weights of random topologies gives higher complexity in 85% of the samples . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , if one were forced to pick only one feature to optimize , either weights or topology but not both , optimizing weights is the better strategy .    before interpreting these results , we should be careful about our definition of complexity , since highly disconnected graphs can achieve high capacity without being complex in any intuitive sense of the word . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the maximal capacity of a network with @xmath47 mutually repressing pairs ( fig  [ fig : diagram]a ) grows exponentially , @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> we note , however , that the maximal capacities that we find for @xmath29gene networks ( @xmath49 for @xmath44 , @xmath50 for @xmath51 ) are larger than @xmath52 , i.e. storing patters in a distributed way is more efficient than splitting the network into many disconnected components . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the highest capacity networks are not trivially so . </S>",
    "<S> further , in the set of all graphs , disconnected topologies are extremely rare and can be expected to provide but a small correction to the averages . </S>",
    "<S> one can construct a better definition , quantifying complexity of a network as the diversity of causal relations in the set of its solutions ( appendix [ app : tsp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this definition naturally handles pathological cases and solution degeneracies , yet for connected graphs it is in excellent agreement with @xmath22 , which is much easier to compute .    within the class of models that we have studied here , it is possible to dissect the contributions of topology and interaction strengths to network complexity </S>",
    "<S> unambiguously , interactions strengths are dominant : starting from a random network , adjusting the strengths of regulatory interactions is a better strategy for increasing its complexity than changing the topology or even adding new nodes @xcite . as in the brain , it seems that topology provides the potential for complexity , but parameters must be adjusted carefully to realize this potential .    </S>",
    "<S> maximally complex network function is accessible only in a small fraction of parameter space , but optimization does not lead to unique parameter settings . instead , there is a whole sector of the underlying continuous parameter space that produces the same results . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in these models , maximizing complexity leads to an interesting combination of tuning and tolerance . </S>",
    "<S> topologies with the greatest potential for complexity do have local structures in common with those identified in real networks @xcite , but it is an open question whether biasing the sampling of topologies toward these structures would , on average , enhance the complexity of network function .    </S>",
    "<S> adjusting parameters is a more efficient method for increasing complexity , as illustrated in fig [ fig : n6 ] , but it still is possible that the evolution of complexity is associated with changes in network topology @xcite . if continuous parameters can evolve more rapidly than topologies can change , which seems plausible , then today s organisms may be dominated by networks that are near optimal given their topology . in this scenario , today s more complex organisms must have networks with different topology than their less complex counterparts , but not because parameters are irrelevant  rather , topology becomes determining only once parameters have been optimized .    </S>",
