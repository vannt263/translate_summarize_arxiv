    "particle production in expanding universe , pionereed by l. parker @xcite , is an essential ingredient of inflationary cosmology @xcite .",
    "the nearly scale invariant spectrum of density perturbations predicted by inflationary models @xcite is at present inextricably related to the concept of amplification of vacuum fluctuations by the geometry .",
    "the scale invariant spectrum for massless minimally coupled fields during a de sitter era was indeed computed before inflation was suggested .    the calculation of the energy carried by these amplified fluctuations is then _ the _ natural question . to answer this question",
    "a renormalization scheme is necessary , as in ordinary minkowski space - time .",
    "ultraviolet divergences due to fluctuations on arbitrary short scales are common in field theory . in minkowski space - time , infinities in a free theory are removed by the subtraction of the vacuum expectation value of the energy , also called normal ordering , the physical justification being that these vacuum contributions are unobservable .",
    "a similar prescription is used in order to regularize infinities in cosmological space - times . however , one additional problem is the absence of an unambiguous choice of vacuum , because of the absence of a class of privileged observers , which are the inertial observers in the minkowski space - times .",
    "the idea is then to subtract the energy associated with a vacuum for which the effects of particle production by the time - dependence of the metric are minimized .",
    "this vacuum is determined by the assumption of an adiabatic expansion of the metric .",
    "this procedure is therefore called _ adiabatic subtraction _ @xcite . in this way",
    "the infinities of field theory are removed .",
    "even with a minimal prescription such as the above , there are several surprising effects accompanying the renormalized energy - momentum tensor ( henceforth emt ) of a test field in cosmological space - times .",
    "to name a few , there could be the avoidance of singularities due to quantum effects @xcite , conformal anomalies which break classical conformal symmetries at the quantum level @xcite , violation of the various energy conditions @xcite .",
    "one of the first models of inflation proposed by starobinsky @xcite was indeed based on the role of the conformal anomaly , which both avoids the singularity and produces an inflationary phase .",
    "while the adiabatic vacuum for a test field - and its associated emt - can be computed for generic cosmological space - times , the unrenormalized emt can be calculated analytically only if exact analytic solutions for the field fourier modes are available .",
    "because of this , space - times such as de sitter have been throughly investigated @xcite , since analytic solutions for a scalar field with generic mass and coupling are available . in the absence of analytic solutions , numerical schemes",
    "are implemented @xcite . in a de sitter space - time",
    ", the back - reaction of a test field seems important only if @xmath3 , with @xmath4 and @xmath5 separately different from zero , or @xmath6 ( @xmath4 is the mass of the test field and @xmath5 its coupling to the curvature @xmath7 ) @xcite . in the former case ,",
    "the emt of the test field grows linearly in time , while in the latter case it grows exponentially .",
    "the emt of a massless minimally coupled field is constant in de sitter space - time @xcite .",
    "inflationary models based on the use of scalar fields , have an accelerated stage , usually called _ slow rollover _ , in which the hubble parameter is almost frozen . during this stage",
    "it is rare to have exact solutions for the fluctuations .",
    "however , these inflationary models are more attractive than the de sitter space - time one in furnishing phenomenological models whose predictions can be tested against observations .",
    "chaotic models @xcite are the simplest among these . in this paper",
    "we study _ analytically _ the problem of back - reaction of inflaton fluctuations during the regime of slow - rollover for the case of a massive inflaton .",
    "we consider inflaton fluctuations in rigid space - times , i.e. we neglect metric perturbations coupled to them , as pioneeringly investigated by abramo , brandenberger and mukhanov @xcite .",
    "we plan to come back to this issue in a future work @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section ii we describe the background classical dynamics for a massive inflaton and the novel analytical approximation for its fluctuations during the slow - rollover regime . in section iii",
    "we discuss the normalization of quantum fluctuations and in section iv we compare the numerical evaluation of the spectrum with the analytic approximation .",
    "we discuss the emt of inflaton fluctuations , the adiabatic subtraction and the renormalization in sections v - vii , respectively .",
    "in section viii the problem of the back - reaction of the emt of inflaton fluctuations is addressed and in section ix our novel analytic approximation is compared with the slow - rollover technique @xcite . in section",
    "x we analyze the production of a secondary massive field @xmath8 lighter than the inflaton and we show that its production depends on the duration of inflation . in section",
    "xi we conclude and in the two appendices we relegate useful formulae for the adiabatic expansion and the dimensional regularization with cut - off .",

    "<S> we study the renormalized energy - momentum tensor ( emt ) of the inflaton fluctuations in rigid space - times during the slow - rollover regime for chaotic inflation with a mass term . </S>",
    "<S> we use dimensional regularization with adiabatic subtraction and introduce a novel analytic approximation for the inflaton fluctuations which is valid during the slow - rollover regime . using this approximation we find a scale invariant spectrum for the inflaton fluctuations in a rigid space - time , and we confirm this result by numerical methods . the resulting renormalized emt is covariantly conserved and agrees with the allen - folacci result in the de sitter limit , when the expansion is exactly linearly exponential in time . </S>",
    "<S> we analytically show that the emt tensor of the inflaton fluctuations grows initially in time , but saturates to the value @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the hubble parameter and @xmath2 is its value when inflation has started . </S>",
    "<S> this result also implies that the quantum production of light scalar fields ( with mass smaller or equal to the inflaton mass ) in this model of chaotic inflation depends on the duration of inflation and is larger than the usual result extrapolated from the de sitter result .    </S>"
