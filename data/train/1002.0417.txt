    "the recent discovery of superconductivity in layered 1111 phase quaternary compounds @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3o ( @xmath1 = lanthinides , @xmath2 = fe and ni , @xmath3 = p and as ) has attracted tremendous attention to this class of materials @xcite . besides this 1111 phase oxy - pnictides , superconductivity was subsequently discovered in other iron(nickel)-based layered compounds with similar fe(ni)as layers @xcite . in all the feas - based parent compounds ,",
    "there is a structural phase transition in the temperature range 100 - 200 k , and a spin - density wave ( sdw ) type antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering associated with fe ions accompanies the structural transition @xcite .",
    "various chemical doping approaches or application of high pressure can suppress the structural transition and afm order , and high-@xmath0 superconductivity consequently appears .",
    "for example , in the feas - based la-1111 system , superconductivity has been achieved by the chemical doping at four different crystallographic sites @xcite . meanwhile , low-@xmath0 superconductivity has been observed in fep - based @xcite and nias(p)-based @xcite compounds with similar layered structure , but there is neither structural transition nor afm ordering associated with fe(ni ) ions in these compounds .",
    "furthermore , many reports have found that both normal state properties and superconductivity of the nias - based systems are likely of conventional type @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that there could be a close relationship between structural transition / afm order and high-@xmath0 superconductivity .",
    "moreover , the origin of the afm order in the parent feas - based pnictides is still an open issue theoretically .",
    "regardless of the origin of the afm ordering , several theories have suggested that the superconductivity is tied to the magnetism in the feas - based materials@xcite .",
    "all these results imply that the mechanism of superconductivity in feas - based systems could be fundamentally different to nias - based systems",
    ". systematic investigation on the physical properties of these parent pnictides can shed light on the mechanisms of superconductivity .",
    "thermoelectric effects are very sensitive to subtle changes in electronic structure , and can provide information on the ground state and low energy excitations .",
    "especially , the transverse magneto - thermoelectric effect , i.e. , nernst effect , which is defined as the appearance of a transverse electric field @xmath4 in response to a temperature gradient @xmath5 in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath6 and under open circuit conditions , has becomes a powerful probe in studying exotic superconductors like high-@xmath0 cuprates @xcite , charge - density wave ( cdw ) superconductor nbse@xmath7 @xcite , heavy fermion superconductors @xcite , and @xmath8-wave superconductor sr@xmath7ruo@xmath9 @xcite etc .",
    "the first report on the nernst effect in f - doped lafeaso superconductor has discovered that the vortex liquid regime below @xmath0 is quite large @xcite , consistent with the simulation result@xcite , and there is an enhanced anomalous nernst signal just above @xmath0 .    here",
    "we report the systematic investigation on the thermopower and nernst effect of feas - based and nias - based parent oxypnictides .",
    "both thermopower and nernst coefficient of the undoped lafeaso system are significantly large compared to usual metals and the strcutural / afm transition causes anomalous changes in thermoelectric properties",
    ". however , the thermopower and nernst effect of the nias - based laniaso system are likely of conventional type , implying usual fermi liquid behavior .",
    "the fundamental difference in the thermoelectric properties of the two systems suggests that there is a close relationship between high-@xmath0 superconductivity and anomalous thermoelectric properties in feas - based systems .",
    "the polycrystalline samples of lafeaso and laniaso were prepared by the solid state reaction using laas , fe@xmath10o@xmath11/nio , fe / ni and laf@xmath11 as starting materials .",
    "the sample preparation details can be found in the previous report @xcite .",
    "the powder x - ray diffraction patterns indicate that the resultant is single phase and all the diffraction peaks can be well indexed based on the tetragonal zrcusias - type structure with the space group p4/nmm .",
    "the resistivity was measured by usual four - probe method .",
    "the hall effect was measured by scanning magnetic field at fixed temperatures .",
    "the thermoelectric properties were measured by a steady - state technique .",
    "the temperature gradient used for the thermoelectric measurements , measured by a pair of differential type e thermocouples , was around @xmath12 k / mm .",
    "all the measurements were performed in a quantum design ppms-@xmath13 system . the nernst signal @xmath14 is defined as @xmath15 .",
    "the nernst signal was measured at positive and negative field polarities , and the difference of the two polarities was taken to remove any thermopower contributions .",
    "the nernst coefficient @xmath16 is equal to @xmath14/@xmath17 . at very low temperatures ,",
    "@xmath14 is not strictly linear with magnetic field @xmath18 , the nernst coefficient is then taken as the initial slope of the @xmath14 versus @xmath19 curves .",
    "traces of nernst signal as a function of magnetic field up to @xmath20@xmath18 of 8 t for the parent oxypnictide lafeaso is displayed in figure 1 at various temperatures . at high temperatures ( see the lower panel of fig.1 ) , the nernst signal ( @xmath14 ) is positive and changes linearly with magnetic field .",
    "the nernst signal reaches a maximum around 100 k. below 100 k , the nernst signal decreases , and becomes a little nonlinear with magnetic field as @xmath21 80 k. between 40 to 60 k , the nernst signal changes from positive to negative .",
    "such a sign change may not suggest the change in the charge carrier type . in multi - band systems ,",
    "the contributions of different bands to the nernst signal could have different signs .",
    "the temperature dependence of nernst coefficient , @xmath22 , together with its thermopower , @xmath23 , is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the temperature dependence of thermopower is consistent with previous reports @xcite , which exhibits a pronounced hump as the system undergoes the structural phase transition / afm ordering at @xmath24 of about 160 k , where @xmath24 is the structural phase transition temperature and it can be determined by the resistivity measurements . the nernst coefficient is defined as the initial slope of @xmath14-@xmath18 curves for @xmath25 .",
    "the nernst coefficient is positive and shows weak temperature dependence as @xmath26 of about 160 k. however @xmath16 starts to increase below @xmath24 of 160 k , reaches a maximum around 100 k , and then decreases with decreasing temperatures . with further cooling ,",
    "it changes sign around 50 k , and then reaches a minimum ( valley ) around 20 k before it finally goes to zero .",
    "compared to the usual metals and the normal state of high-@xmath0 cuprates , @xmath22 is much larger .    in order to get more insight on the thermoelectric effect ,",
    "the ratio of @xmath16/@xmath27 is calculated and plotted in the upper panel of fig.3 .",
    "there is a very clear sharp drop in @xmath16/@xmath27 as the system becomes afm ordered below @xmath24 .",
    "but the ratio increases monotonously with further cooling . by measuring the hall effect and thermopower simultaneously",
    ", the off - diagonal thermoelectric ( peltier conductivity ) term can be separated from the nernst signal and then both the hall angle tan@xmath28 ( defined as @xmath29/@xmath30 ) and `` thermal '' hall angle tan@xmath31 ( defined as @xmath32/@xmath33 ) can be obtained . the temperature dependence of hall coefficient ( @xmath34 ) measured under magnetic field ( @xmath19 ) of 8 t",
    "is also shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "@xmath35 is negative , suggesting that the dominant charge carrier is electron - like , consistent with previous reports @xcite .",
    "the @xmath35 is about -4.8@xmath36 m@xmath37/c at @xmath2 = 300 k , corresponding to a hall number ( @xmath38 = 1/(@xmath39 ) ) of about 0.18 electrons per unit cell , which could be an upper limit for the electron concentration @xmath40 because lafeaso is a nearly compensated metal according to the band calculations @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "the more metallic bafe@xmath7as@xmath7 has a hall number of about 0.56 electrons per unit cell at room temperature according to the hall effect measurements , but band calculations predict a hall number of 0.15 electrons per unit cell @xcite .",
    "the normal state nernst signal is comprised of two terms , viz .",
    "@xmath41 where @xmath32 is the off - diagonal peltier coefficient , @xmath42 the thermopower ( @xmath43 the diagonal conductivity and @xmath33 the diagonal peltier coefficient ) , @xmath30 the resisitivity , tan@xmath28 the hall angle , and tan@xmath31 the `` thermal '' hall angle . for usual simple metals , the two terms related to the hall angle and `` thermal '' hall angle in eq .",
    "( 1 ) cancel each other , which is so - called `` sondheimer cancellation '' @xcite .",
    "it is known that hall angle , rather than hall coefficient , is directly related to the scattering rate of the quasiparticle scattering .",
    "the hall angle can be calculated from the hall coefficient , i.e. , tan@xmath28 = @xmath29/@xmath30 , and then the `` thermal '' hall angle can be obtained from the nernst signal by using eq.(1 ) . the obtained hall angle and `` thermal '' hall angle",
    "are plotted in the lower panel of fig.3 as a function of temperature .",
    "the two angles exhibit very different temperature dependence , especially the decrease in the `` thermal '' hall angle is much more significant below @xmath24 .",
    "it becomes clear that the sondheimer cancellation of the nernst signal is no longer held for lafeaso because of the different temperature dependence of the two angles below @xmath24 . even above @xmath24 ,",
    "the nernst coefficient is also larger than that of usual metals .",
    "the enhanced nernst signal above @xmath24 could result from the multi - band effect .",
    "the presence of two types of charge carriers in multi - band systems such as nbse@xmath7@xcite , could invalidate the sondheimer cancellation , resulting in a large nernst signal .",
    "however it is hard to understand the anomalous temperature dependence of @xmath16 below @xmath24 even in the frame of multi - band effect .",
    "there might be significant changes in the scattering mechanism below @xmath24 , and these changes seem to have more pronounced influence on the thermal channel .",
    "we propose that the sdw order or sdw fluctuations could affect the spin - dependent scattering process and thus cause significant changes in the scattering rates which could be band - dependent .",
    "subtle changes in the scattering mechanism could causes anomalous nernst effect , as observed in the p - wave superconductor sr@xmath7ruo@xmath9@xcite .",
    "the first - principles band calculations have proposed that the nesting between the electron - type fermi surface ( fs ) and hole - type fs could account for the afm transition in the parent compounds such as lafeaso , and that the superconductive pairing might be mediated by spin fluctuations @xcite . moreover",
    ", the studies of angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) discovered that the coexistence of hole and electron pockets connected via the afm wave vector is essential to high-@xmath0 superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the afm order and structural phase transition in the parent compounds causes significant changes in the electronic structure . based on our measurements of resistivity and hall effect , the charge carrier concentration in lafeaso estimated by the hall number decreases by a factor of about 100 and meanwhile the scattering rate ( in inverse proportion to the mobility ) decreases by a factor of about 160 as temperature decreases from 300 k to 10 k. for the parent compound bafe@xmath7as@xmath7 ,",
    "similar results were reported @xcite .",
    "such changes in the charge carrier concentration and scattering rates in the parent compound bafe@xmath7as@xmath7 , srfe@xmath7as@xmath7 , and eufe@xmath7as@xmath7 were also reported by the optical spectroscopy measurements @xcite .",
    "all the results suggest that the charge carrier transport are dominated by the afm fluctuations in the parent compounds .",
    "when the system undergoes the afm order below about 160 k , the charge carrier concentration deceases sharply due to the sdw gapping on fss , but the scattering rates decreases even more drastically due to the afm order which suppresses the spin fluctuations .",
    "it can be seen from fig.3 , the afm order may have more pronounced influence on the thermal channel .",
    "thus our results imply that the anomalous changes in the thermopower and nernst coefficient in lafeaso should have close relation with the inter - band scattering between electron - type and hole - type bands .",
    "the thermopower and hall coefficient ( measured under @xmath19 of 5 t ) of laniaso are plotted as a function of temperature in fig.4 .",
    "the negative @xmath35 implies that the charge carriers are dominantly electron type , same as in lafeaso .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath35 for laniaso is more than 1 order of magnitude smaller than that of lafeaso , possibly indicating that the laniaso system has a relatively higher carrier density .",
    "the hall number @xmath38 at @xmath2 = 300 k is about 8.3 electrons per unit cell , about 50 times larger compared to lafeaso .",
    "since ni@xmath443@xmath45 contributes two more electrons than fe ion does , the fermi energy shifts up in laniaso , and the hole bands tend to be fully filled . as a result predicted by band calculations@xcite ,",
    "the electron bands dominate the conductivity in laniaso @xcite .",
    "the much smaller thermopower also suggests that laniaso is a good metal with high density of charge carriers compared to lafeaso . the small hollow in @xmath27 at low temperature",
    "could be caused by phonon drag effect .",
    "it is interesting that @xmath35 also exhibits a sharp decrease below 50 k. such a change in @xmath35 at low temperature has not been well understood presently .",
    "traces of nernst signal as a function of magnetic field for laniaso is displayed in fig.5 at several selected temperatures .",
    "the nernst signal ( @xmath14 ) is very small , comparable to the noise level ( the noise voltage is about 10 nv in our measurement system ) .",
    "this nernst signal is as small as usual metals .",
    "@xmath14 at @xmath19 of 6",
    "t is only in the range of @xmath4630 nv / k , almost two order of magnitude smaller than that of lafeaso .",
    "the nernst coefficient is obtained by fitting the @xmath47 vs. @xmath18 curves with a linear function , and it is plotted in fig.6 .",
    "the hall angle tan@xmath28 and the term @xmath27tan@xmath28 are also plotted in fig.6 for comparison .",
    "it can seen that the nernst coefficient is comparable to the term @xmath27tan@xmath28 , implying that the sondheimer cancellation is partially held and the system could be dominated by only one type charge carrier ( electron ) .",
    "please note that the temperature dependence of tan@xmath28 is very weak and its magnitude is much smaller that that of lafeaso , especially at low temperatures .",
    "the result of nernst effect suggests that laniaso is like usual metal and only one type ( electron - type ) charge carrier dominates .",
    "@xcite compared the band structures of lafeaso and laniaso by first - princeples calculations .",
    "it was found that the electron fs cylinders around m point becomes larger for laniaso , and the hole - type fs cylinders around @xmath48 point disappear .",
    "thus the nesting between hole - type fss and electron - type fss proposed in lafeaso is no longer held in laniaso .",
    "recall that the multi - band effect could account for the enhanced nernst signals in both parent and f - doped lafeaso which has relatively high superconducitng transition temperatures , the inter - band scattering should indeed play an important role in the occurrence of high @xmath0 . on the other hand",
    ", our result suggests that the laniaso system lacks of such an inter - band scattering mechanism , and thus it has a low @xmath0 .",
    "the relationship between high-@xmath0 superconductivity and the inter - band scattering is worthy of further experimental investigations .",
    "in summary , we report the thermeropower and nernst effect of feas - based and nias - based parent oxypnictides . for the lafeaso system , it is found that both thermopower and nernst coefficient are significantly large compared to usual metals and the structural / afm transition associated with fe ions causes significant enhancements in the thermoelectric coefficients .",
    "we propose that the unique strong inter - band scattering as well as electron correlation in feas - based systems may account for these anomalies in thermoelectric properties .",
    "meanwhile , the thermopower and nernst effect of the nias - based laniaso system are of conventional type , implying usual fermi liquid behavior .",
    "the fundamental difference in the thermoelectric properties of the two systems suggests that there is a close relationship between high-@xmath49 superconductivity and anomalous thermoelectric properties in feas - based pnictides .",
