    "electromagnetic cascades , namely the evolution of @xmath0 particle numbers and energy distribution following the injection of a energetic @xmath1 or @xmath2 in a medium filled with radiation , magnetic fields and matter , is one of the physical processes most frequently encountered in astroparticle physics , in domains as disparate as high - energy gamma - ray astrophysics , ultra - high - energy cosmic ray propagation , or the physics of the early universe . in particular , the elementary theory of such a cascade onto a photon background has been well known since decades , and can be shown via a textbook derivation ( see chapter viii in  @xcite , for instance ) to lead to a universal `` meta - stable '' spectrum  attained on timescales much shorter than the thermodynamical equilibration scale  of the form : @xmath3 in the above expression , @xmath4^{-1}$ ] is a normalization constant enforcing the condition that the total energy is equal to the injected electromagnetic energy , @xmath5 ; the characteristic energy @xmath6 denotes the effective threshold for pair - production ( @xmath7 being the highest energy of the photon background onto which pairs can be effectively created ) ; @xmath8 is the maximum energy of up - scattered inverse compton ( ic ) photons .",
    "natural units with @xmath9 are used throughout .",
    "a notable application of this formalism concerns the possibility of a non - thermal nucleosynthesis phase in the early universe ( for recent review on this and other aspects of primordial nucleosynthesis , or bbn , see  @xcite ) .",
    "the determination of the baryon energy density of the universe @xmath10 inferred from the cmb acoustic peaks measurements can be used in fact to turn the standard bbn into a parameter - free theory .",
    "the resulting predictions for the deuterium abundance ( or @xmath11h , the most sensitive nuclide to @xmath10 ) are in remarkable agreement with observations , providing a tight consistency check for the standard cosmological scenario .",
    "the @xmath12he and @xmath13he yields too are , broadly speaking , consistent with this value , although affected by larger uncertainties .",
    "the @xmath14li prediction , however , is a factor @xmath15 above its determination in the atmosphere of metal - poor halo stars .",
    "if this is interpreted as reflecting a cosmological value  as opposed to a post - primordial astrophysical reprocessing , a question which is far from settled  @xcite  it requires a non - standard bbn mechanism , for which a number of possibilities have been explored  @xcite .    in particular , cosmological solutions based on electromagnetic cascades",
    "have been proposed in the last decade , see for instance  @xcite .",
    "however , typically they do not appear to be viable  @xcite , as confirmed also in recent investigations ( see for instance fig . 4 in  @xcite , dealing with massive `` paraphotons '' ) due to the fact that whenever the cascade is efficient in destroying enough @xmath14li , the destruction of @xmath11h is too extreme , and spoils the agreement with the cmb observations mentioned above .",
    "actually , this tension also affects some non - e.m .",
    "non - thermal bbn models , see for instance  @xcite .",
    "this difficulty can be evaded if one exploits the property that @xmath14be ( from which most of @xmath14li come from for the currently preferred value of @xmath10 , via late electron capture decays ) has the lowest photodissociation threshold among light nuclei , of about @xmath16mev vs. @xmath17mev for next to most fragile , @xmath11h .",
    "hence , to avoid any constraint from @xmath11h while being still able to photo - disintegrate some @xmath14be , it is sufficient to inject photons with energy @xmath18 , with a `` fine - tuned '' solution  ( see e.g. the remark in  @xcite or the discussion in  @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless , it turns out to be hard or impossible to produce a sizable reduction of the final @xmath14li yield , while respecting other cosmological bounds , such as those coming from extra relativistic degrees of freedom ( @xmath19 ) or spectral distortions of the cmb .",
    "a recent concrete example of these difficulties has been illustrated in  @xcite , which tried such a fine - tuned solution by studying the effects of o(10 ) mev sterile neutrino decays .    in this article , we point out that , depending on the epoch , _ at sufficiently low energies of injection the cascade develops differently and the final spectrum is significantly altered with respect to eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum ] ) _ , which has been incorrectly used till recently , see e.g.  @xcite . as a concrete application",
    ", we show how this re - opens a window to a cosmological solution to the @xmath14li problem via e.m .",
    "additionally , one expects peculiar signatures associated to such scenarios , which can be probed with cosmological observations . we will discuss this both in a proof - of - principle example and in the context of a particle physics model , involving one sterile neutrino",
    "this was chosen for its simplicity and to allow for a direct comparison with the results of @xcite , which studied a similar model .",
    "further considerations on some additional implications of our insight are finally outlined .",
    "our argument is the following : let us assume that one injects photons at some time ( or corresponding plasma temperature @xmath20 ) whose energy @xmath5 is below the pair production threshold at that epoch , which can be estimated for the cmb plasma to be @xmath21mev  @xcite . note that _ as long as @xmath22kev , this is compatible with the typical nuclear photo - disintegration energies relevant for bbn_. it is clear that the spectrum of eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum ] ) can not stay valid in this regime : there is no pair - production cutoff , of course , but even the lower - energy part can not be correctly captured by eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum ] ) . unless one considers _ other physical processes _ for the photon interactions ,",
    "not included in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum ] ) , there are no non - thermal electrons which can up - scatter cmb photons !",
    "since the photon interaction probability is much smaller below pair production threshold , at leading level the injected spectrum below @xmath23 stays the same ",
    "apart for red - shifting , which happens on very long timescales with respect to particle photon interactions and hence we neglect . accounting for the finite probability for the photons to scatter  via @xmath24 , via compton scattering off the background electrons , or via bethe - heitler @xmath25 production onto background protons and helium nuclei  one does end up with a suppression of the injected spectrum , plus a lower energy tail due to downgraded energy @xmath1 s as well as @xmath1 s produced via ic by the secondary @xmath2 s .",
    "the resulting secondary or tertiary photons , on the other hand , are typically at too low - energies to contribute to photo - dissociations and will be neglected . within this approximation , the boltzmann equation describing",
    "the evolution of the distribution function @xmath26 reads : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the source injection term , @xmath29 is the total interaction rate , and we neglected the hubble expansion rate  , since interaction rates are much faster and rapidly drive @xmath26 to a quasi - static equilibrium , @xmath30 .",
    "thus , we simply have : @xmath31 where the term @xmath32 for an exponentially decaying species with lifetime @xmath33 and density @xmath34 , whose total e.m . energy injected per particle is @xmath5 , can be written as @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the redshift at time @xmath37 , and the energy parameter @xmath38 ( conventionally used in the literature ) is simply defined in terms of the initial comoving density of the @xmath39 particle @xmath40 and the actual one of the cmb , @xmath41 , via @xmath42",
    ". a monochromatic emission line would then correspond to @xmath43 .",
    "for a two body decay @xmath44 into a monochromatic line plus another not better specified ( quasi)massless particle @xmath45 , one would have @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the mass of the particle . here",
    ", we will be interested in multi - mev values for the mass @xmath47 and at temperatures of order few kev or lower , hence the thermal broadening is negligible and a dirac delta spectrum as the one above is appropriate .",
    "the interaction rate @xmath48 is computed by accounting for : i ) compton scattering over thermal electrons , @xmath49 , taken from @xcite ; ii ) scattering off cmb photons : @xmath50 , for which we follow  @xcite ; iii ) bethe - heitler pair creation : @xmath51 , for which we use the formulae of @xcite .",
    "note that we neglect the small effect due to the finite probability for the secondary or tertiary photons to induce some dissociations , i.e. once a photon interacts it is `` lost '' .",
    "the results that we obtain are in this respect slightly conservative , by an amount which we estimated to be of the order of a few @xmath52 .",
    "at temperatures of few kev or lower , the standard bbn is over , and the additional nucleosynthesis can be simply dealt with as a post - processing of the abundances computed in the standard scenario .",
    "the non - thermal nucleosynthesis due to electromagnetic cascades can be described by a system of coupled differential equations of the type @xmath53 where : @xmath54 is the ratio of the number density of the nucleus @xmath55 to the total baryon number density @xmath56 ( this factors out the trivial evolution due to the expansion of the universe ) ; @xmath57 is the photodissociation cross sections onto the nuclei @xmath20 into the nucleus @xmath55 , i.e. the production channel for @xmath55 ; @xmath58 is the analogous destruction channel ( both cross sections are actually vanishing below the corresponding thresholds ) . in general",
    "one also needs to follow secondary reactions of the nuclear byproducts of the photodissociation , which can spallate on or fuse with background thermalized target nuclei ( see for instance  @xcite ) but none of that is relevant for the problem at hand .",
    "if the injected energy is @xmath59 , the only open non - thermal bbn channel is @xmath60 , whose cross - section   we denote with @xmath61 , there are no relevant source terms and only one evolving species ( since @xmath62 ) , thus yielding for the final ( at @xmath63 ) to initial ( at @xmath64 ) abundance ratio @xmath65 to obtain eq .",

    "( [ nonthbbn ] ) into redshift space , defining @xmath66 as appropriate for a universe dominated by radiation , with @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 being the present hubble expansion rate and fractional radiation energy density , respectively . by construction , equating the suppression factor given by the rhs of the eq .",
    "( [ result ] ) to @xmath70 provides a solution to the @xmath14li problem which is in agreement with all other constraints from bbn . in fig .",
    "[ fig : resultsberylliummonochromatic ] , the lower band shows for each @xmath33 the range of @xmath38 corresponding to a depletion from 40% to 70% , for the case @xmath71mev . similar results would follow by varying @xmath5 by 10% about this value , i.e. provided one is not too close to the reaction threshold .",
    "the upper band represents the analogous region if we had distributed the same injected energy according to the spectrum of eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum ] ) , up to min[@xmath72 .",
    "it is clear that in the correct treatment a large portion of this region survives other cosmological constraints , described below , while none survives in the incorrect treatment .     vs. lifetime @xmath33 ,",
    "for which the primordial lithium is depleted to 40% to 70% of its standard value , for a monochromatic photon injection with energy @xmath73 .",
    "the upper band represents the analogous region if we had distributed the same injected energy , up to @xmath71mev , according to the erroneous spectrum of eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum ] ) . above the solid blue curve , a change in entropy ( and @xmath10 ) between bbn and cmb time larger than the @xmath74 error inferred from cmb would be obtained .",
    "the region to the right of the dot - dashed green curve is excluded by current constraints from @xmath75-distortions in the cmb spectrum  @xcite according to the computation of  @xcite , while the dashed cyan curve illustrates the weaker bounds that would follow from the less accurate parameterization of  @xcite .",
    "the dotted red curve is the forecasted sensitivity of the future experiment pixie , corresponding to @xmath76@xcite.[fig : resultsberylliummonochromatic],scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "we mentioned the baryon abundances @xmath10 inferred from cmb and bbn ( notably @xmath11h ) probes are consistent within errors .",
    "this implies that no major injection of entropy took place between the bbn time and the cmb epoch , otherwise the baryon - to - photon ratio ( proportional to @xmath10 ) would have changed , see for instance  @xcite . in a radiation - dominated universe , the change in entropy associated to a release of energy into _ all _ e.m .",
    "particles characterized by parameter @xmath77 and a lifetime @xmath33 can be estimated as @xmath78 for illustration , in fig .",
    "[ fig : resultsberylliummonochromatic ] the solid blue line represent the level of entropy release associated to a variation of @xmath74 around the best - fit measured value of @xmath79 by planck , @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "since the level of injected energy needed to solve the lithium problem via a monochromatic line is up to two orders of magnitude below the bounds , it is clear that this constraint is very weak , but for very short lifetimes of the order of @xmath81s .",
    "another constraint comes from the level of _ spectral distortions _ in the cmb . for the relatively short lifetimes relevant for the problem ,",
    "the compton scattering is fast enough that energy - redistribution is effective , no @xmath82-type distortion survives . on the other hand",
    ", processes that change the number of photons are relatively rare , and a residual distortion of the @xmath75-type is possible .",
    "this has been constrained by cobe - firas to be @xmath83  @xcite .",
    "the level of spectral distortion produced by the decay process here has been estimated in the past ( see for instance  @xcite ) , but a recent re - evaluation  @xcite found significant improvements at short lifetimes , essentially due to a better treatment of the time - dependence of the visibility function . the theoretical expectation for @xmath75",
    "can be written as @xmath84 where the function @xmath85 is taken from  @xcite .",
    "the bound excludes the region to the right of the dot - dashed , green curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : resultsberylliummonochromatic ] . for comparison , the dashed cyan curve reports the much weaker bound that would follow from the approximations in  @xcite .",
    "we also checked that the extra constraint due to extra `` dark radiation '' parameterized by @xmath19 is irrelevant as long as the branching ratio in extra relativistic species is not larger than _ a couple of orders of magnitudes _ with respect to the photon one .",
    "we thus conclude that there is a significant interval of lifetimes ( @xmath86 ) and corresponding energy injection parameter @xmath87 for which a perfectly viable solution is possible .",
    "we remind once again that this possibility appeared to be closed due to the use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum ] ) beyond its regime of applicability .",
    "one may wonder how realistic such a situation is in a concrete particle physics model .",
    "although we refrain here from detailed model - building considerations , it is worth showing as a proof - of - principle that models realizing the mechanism described here while fulfilling the other cosmological constraints ( as well as laboratory ones ) can be actually constructed .",
    "let us take the simplest case of a sterile majorana neutrino with mass in the range @xmath88 , mixing with flavour @xmath89 neutrinos via an angle @xmath90 .",
    "we also define @xmath91 .",
    "the three main decay channels of this neutrino are ( see e.g.  @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) :    * @xmath92 , with rate @xmath93 ; * @xmath94 , with a rate depending on single @xmath95 s ; * @xmath96 , with a rate @xmath97 .",
    "the resulting branching ratios for the masses of interest and @xmath98 are of the level of @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "it is physically more instructive to normalize the abundance of the @xmath100 , @xmath101 , in terms of one thermalized neutrino ( plus antineutrino ) flavour species , @xmath102 . in fig .",

    "we have discussed the breaking of the universality of the photon spectrum in electromagnetic cascades , when the energy of the injected photons falls below the pair - production threshold .",
    "this may be of interest for a number of astroparticle applications , but in the specific case of the cosmological context , this happens when @xmath107mev .",
    "we noted that the energies concerned are of the same level of the binding energies of light nuclei .",
    "this implies a potential large impact on non - thermal nucleosynthesis models , notably of electromagnetic type , but could be also relevant for models with late time hadronic cascades .",
    "we provided an analytical estimate of the resulting ( much harder ) meta - stable spectrum of non - thermal photons , and showed that the impact is so large that it can potentially re - open the possibility of electromagnetic cacade solutions to the so - called `` lithium problem '' , which were thought to be excluded by other cosmological constraints .",
    "we substantiated this point with a proof - of - principle example of a photon line injection at @xmath108mev from a particle decay , satisfying by construction all other bbn constraints but , not trivially , also all other cosmological bounds plaguing previous attempts .",
    "although we did not indulge into particle model building , we proved that the right conditions can be actually satisfied in a simple scenario involving a @xmath109mev sterile neutrino mostly mixed with @xmath110 and/or @xmath111 with effective mixing angle @xmath112 .",
    "the possibility to find new mechanisms to deplete the standard bbn prediction of lithium abundance in a consistent way is probably the most spectacular consequence of our investigation . in turn",
    ", this could stimulate more specific model - building activities .",
    "for instance , decays of relatively light new neutral fermionic particles @xmath39 for which the @xmath113 channel is the only two body standard model channel opened  as it is the case for the light gravitinos in supergravity models  constitute a natural class of candidates .",
    "alternatively , one may think of decaying scenarios involving a pair of quasi degenerate mass states @xmath39 and @xmath114 , which are potentially much heavier than the mev scale .",
    "some of these scenarios may be motivated by other astroparticle or particle physics reasons and certainly deserve further investigation .",
    "we also showed how improvements in the determination of @xmath115type spectral distortions bounds of the cmb might be crucial to test these scenarios : testing frameworks for the particle physics solutions to the lithium problem may thus provide additional scientific motivations for future instruments like pixie  @xcite .",
    "computations of distortions corresponding to specific injection histories may also be refined : for instance , for short lifetimes relativistic corrections to the double compton and compton scattering may be important to improve the theoretical accuracy  @xcite .    finally , from a phenomenological perspective , an obvious spin - off of our work would be to re - compute the bbn bounds to electromagnetic decaying particles in cases where the universality of the spectrum of eq .",
