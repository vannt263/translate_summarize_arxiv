    "the cepheid period - luminosity relation ( plr ) remains an important rung of the cosmic distance ladder , and is an integral means of establishing the hubble constant ( @xcite , and @xcite ( e14 ) ) .",
    "apart from using galactic cepheids to establish the plr calibration , another place that is usually used for this calibration is the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "extensive studies have been conducted to study the variable stars content in the lmc with the ogle project probably being the most extensive @xcite .",
    "cepheids in the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) belong to the closest spiral galaxy exhibiting near - solar abundances .",
    "observations of these cepheids are particularly important since the impact of metallicity on the plr is actively debated ( e.g. , , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore a debate continues concerning the existence of a broken plr slope @xcite .",
    "both these effects may impact the establishment of the hubble constant and the cosmic distance scale .",
    "the difficulty with m31 is its crowding ( overlapping point spread functions ( psfs ) ) and blending caused by the high inclination . in order to obtain a representative sample of the whole galaxy ,",
    "the large angular size makes wide field ccds necessary .",
    "for a recent summary of ground based cepheid observations in m31 see @xcite ( hereafter k13 ) .",
    "applying statistical tests such as an f - test find a broken slope at 10 days in the bvicjh bands but a linear relation in the ks band and the wesenheit functions .",
    "@xcite on the other hand find that their magellanic cloud period - wesenheit relations are linear .",
    "@xcite observe non linear relations in the vi bands and that the wesenheit function behaves exponentially .",
    "near - infrared photometry has the advantage that the extinction is low @xcite and that the amplitudes of the cepheids are usually smaller than in the optical @xcite .",
    "the increase in the dispersion of the plr caused by random phased observations is minimized for small amplitudes .",
    "hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations in the near - infrared allow for very precise plrs with small dispersion as shown recently by @xcite ( hereafter r12 ) .",
    "nevertheless there are also cepheids with near - infrared amplitudes of around 0.5 mag .",
    "these cepheids increase the dispersion if random phased observations are used .",
    "an outlier rejection mitigates this problem .",
    "the optimal solution is to use mean phase observations or perform a phase correction .",
    "hst observations also help with the problem of crowding .",
    "the ground - based observations are in this case only used to identify the position of the cepheid and to obtain the period of the cepheid .    in this paper",
    "we follow this approach and combine ground based observations with near - infrared hst observations . as a cepheid sample",
    "we use the 2009 cepheids published in k13 .",
    "the hst observations are from the phat survey of m31 @xcite .",
    "the phat data cover roughly a third of the disk of m31 in 6 filters ( f275w , f336w , f475w , f814w , f110w and f160w ) with two orbits per pointing . the relative difference to r12 is that we included all three years of phat observations that are now available and that our cepheid sample ( with up to 180 photometric epochs ) is published and available in cds .",
    "the sample ( up to 50 epochs ) which is used in r12 is larger but not yet publicly available .",
    "as discussed in e14 the r12 outlier rejection procedure can lead to underestimated errors in the plr parameters .",
    "we develop an outlier rejection procedure that is similar to the one proposed by e14 , but more robust ( i.e. the convergence is less susceptible to starting parameters ) .",
    "another change compared to r12 is that we develop a sophisticated pipeline that uses difference images to identify the correct source in the phat data instead of relying on information from the uv filters when the source identification is unclear .",
    "the reason is that there is no uv information for each cepheid , while good hst difference images are available for almost all cepheids .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : section [ datareduction ] discusses the data reduction and how to identify the correct source in the phat data .",
    "section [ section_outlier ] describes our outlier rejection procedure .",
    "the period - luminosity relations are discussed in section [ chapter_plrs ] .",
    "the impact of the improved plrs on the hubble constant is examined in section [ chapter_h0 ] followed by the conclusions in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the goal is to obtain near - infrared photometry of the cepheid sample published in k13 .",
    "the k13 cepheid sample contains 2009 cepheids obtained during the first year ( up to 180 epochs ) of ps1 pandromeda observations @xcite .",
    "the sample consists of 1440 fundamental mode ( fm ) cepheids , 126 first overtone ( fo ) and 147 type ii cepheids . for 296 cepheids",
    "the type of cepheid could not be assigned .",
    "the cepheid type was automatically assigned in a three dimensional space of period , amplitude ratio and phase difference , where the last two parameters were obtained from fourier decomposition of the light curve . in order to obtain near - infrared photometry we match this data set with the phat data @xcite .",
    "we obtained the phat data in november 2013 from the mast archive . at that time",
    "photometry was not available for all bricks .",
    "therefore we ran dolphot @xcite on all data with the same parameters that were used on the already available photometry in the mast archive .",
    "additionally we put artificial stars into the images and tested the impact of crowding on the photometry of the cepheids . for each cepheid",
    "we put an artificial star of the magnitude of the cepheid in proximity to the cepheid .",
    "we do this iteratively 10000 times in order to estimate the impact the environment of the cepheid has on the photometry .",
    "as expected for crowding a very close source to the artificial cepheid causes the recovered magnitude of the artificial star to be brighter . with this procedure",
    "it is possible to test the effect of overlapping psfs , i.e. crowding , but not the impact of blending . above a certain distance between fake source and the corresponding closest source",
    "the recovered magnitude should match the magnitude of the source that was put into the image .",
    "for a field close to the center of m31 ( brick 01 , field 09 ) we compare the photometry of the already published phat catalog with the photometry we obtain when we use the same dolphot parameters as in the phat catalog ( the catalog also includes the parameter files ) . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_phat_color ] our photometry matches that of the published phat catalog in this field .",
    "the small offset can be attributed to the fact that we make use of the improved anderson psfs @xcite in our photometry .",
    "the anderson psfs take into account the spatial variation over the field of view .",
    "but when we investigate the crowding of the cepheids using these dolphot parameters we observe a strange behavior .",
    "the recovered magnitude of the fake star is fainter if there is no source close by , i.e. @xmath1 .",
    "this effect is of the order of @xmath2 mag for a closest source separation of 4 pixels ( crowding becomes relevant for separations closer than 1.5 pixels ) .",
    "this problem seems to be caused by the background determination , since the flux of the artificial star can only be attributed to the background , due to the lack of other sources nearby .",
    "a change of the sky fitting parameter of dolphot from the default parameter that is used by phat , to the one recommended for highly crowded fields alleviates the problem , i.e. @xmath3 mag . using this parameter we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig_crowding ] that crowding is not present for closest neighbor distances larger than 1.5 pixels and that the crowding typically changes the magnitude of the cepheid by no more than @xmath4 mag .",
    "of course this is only statistically true and the real change of the magnitude can be higher and is also dependent on the magnitude of the source that is close to the cepheid . changing the background determination parameter also changes the photometry .",
    "the comparison to the phat catalog can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_phat_color_new ] .",
    "the photometry of the cepheids is only slightly affected by the change of the background parameter .",
    "the results are also not significantly changed by the different sky fitting .",
    "the impact of crowding on the photometry of the cepheids is also very small and we therefore use the complete cepheid sample .",
    "although our results do not change significantly due to crowding , for the interested reader the appendix includes all results without using the cepheids that have sources closer than 1.5 pixels .",
    "we developed a pipeline that identifies the cepheids from the first year of pandromeda observations ( k13 ) in the phat data .",
    "for each cepheid the pipeline astrometrically matches the corresponding phat frames ( of all filters ) to the ps1 reference frame .",
    "after that step we create stamp outs ( i.e. small images around the cepheid ) from the aligned phat data and the ps1 data .",
    "additionally the pipeline produces difference images from the phat data .",
    "the number of epochs for each cepheid is highly dependent on its position ( i.e. if it is in an overlap of phat bricks ) .",
    "however , due to the observing strategy the optical phat filters have at least two epochs ( c.f .",
    "fig . 5 in @xcite ) . then the cepheid is identified automatically from these phat difference images .",
    "this rather sophisticated procedure is necessary due to the fact that it is often unclear which source is the cepheid in question , as the hst images resolve the error circle of the ps1 source into typically multiple sources . to make sure that the correct source is selected we inspect the result from the pipeline by eye .",
    "this involves checking the phat stamp outs and difference frame stamp outs of each cepheid for consistency .",
    "this means making sure that the same source is selected in all filters .",
    "the pipeline works remarkably well and the few times it fails the information from the wfc3-uvis frames helps to identify the correct source visually .",
    "r12 use the uvis information to select the correct source when there is a close neighboring source .",
    "although the uvis data can be very helpful , the problem with this approach is that there are not always uvis observations available and that the uvis data can be too shallow to find the source .",
    "this is why a source identification based solely on the uvis information proved to be inferior to the difference image method .",
    "we were able to identify 557 cepheids from the 2009 cepheids published in k13 in the phat data ( all bands ) .",
    "528 have f110w ( close to j band ) measurements and 494 have f160w ( h band ) measurements .",
    "492 cepheids have f110w and f160w data .",
    "while we use all bands for the source identification , in this paper we will only discuss the cepheids with wfc3-ir data .",
    "the obtained magnitudes are random phased .",
    "we perform no phase correction since the ps1 epochs in k13 do not cover all phat epochs .",
    "the precision of the periods from just the first year of pandromeda observations can be insufficient to determine the correct phase for some phat epochs two years apart from the k13 data . with the full ps1 data set of three years we will be able to perform phase corrections . in the few cases in which multiple phat measurements are available we therefore use the mean magnitude .    to check our photometry",
    "we compare it to r12 .",
    "51 of the 68 r12 cepheids are contained in the k13 sample .",
    "cepheid vn.2.2.463 is present twice in the r12 sample with the same identifier , position , period and f160w photometry , but with a different f110w photometry .",
    "so there are rather 50 of the 67 r12 cepheids contained in k13 .",
    "we run the remaining 17 cepheids through our pipeline and include them in our comparison .",
    "we compare the stamp outs provided in r12 to our source identification and find only one deviation . for cepheid vn.2.3.69 ( pso j011.4455 + 41.9120 )",
    "our difference frames indicate that the variable source ( cepheid ) is indeed the source next to the one identified in the r12 stamp out .",
    "we marked this cepheid with a red d in fig .",
    "[ fig_compare_riess_160 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_compare_riess_110 ] .",
    "[ fig_compare_riess_160 ] shows a mean magnitude difference in f160w photometry of @xmath5 mag .",
    "[ fig_compare_riess_110 ] indicates a mean magnitude difference of @xmath6 mag in f110w .",
    "the two outliers below @xmath7 mag have a very close source nearby and the offset can be explained by the fact that r12 use aperture photometry in f110w .",
    "however that does not explain the offset of approximately a quarter of a magnitude in f110w .",
    "this difference remains approximately the same if we perform aperture photometry .",
    "the reason for this offset is that r12 used the stsci table for the aperture correction that gives the ensquared energy fraction vs. the aperture size in pixels but assumed this to be the encircled energy fraction ( a. riess , private communication 2014 ) .",
    "this explains the offset in f110w .",
    "we conclude that our photometry matches that of r12 .",
    "after finding 492 cepheids with f110w and f160w photometry in the phat data we want to investigate the period - luminosity relation ( plr ) . as a first step",
    "we have to exclude the outliers of our sample that can be seen in fig . [ fig_wesenheit_raw ] .",
    "the wesenheit magnitude , which is reddening - free , used in this figure is defined as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 can be obtained from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 6 with @xmath10 ) @xmath11    there are different reasons for outliers in the period - luminosity relation , namely blending , crowding , extinction , misidentification and misclassification . in the case of blending multiple sources sit along the same line of sight .",
    "this is the most difficult case to resolve due to the fact that it needs extensive modeling to do so .",
    "studied the impact of blending on the m31 distance and concluded that blending impacts the m31 distance on a @xmath12 mag level which makes it as significant as the impact of metallicity .",
    "crowding introduces errors in the photometry due to overlapping point spread functions ( psfs ) .",
    "this is obviously worse in ground based observations where the psfs are larger .",
    "the hubble space telescope ( hst ) psf is well determined and stable and as discussed in the previous section ( see fig . [ fig_crowding ] ) , crowding does not significantly contribute to our photometric errors .",
    "determining the correct extinction for each cepheid with spectroscopy is un practical for cepheids in m31 due to the long exposure times needed and the large spatial extent of m31 . in our case we have nir photometry available for which the extinction is low @xcite . another way to get a handle on extinction is to use wesenheit magnitudes @xmath13 that are independent of reddening .    the simplest cause for an outlier is misidentification , i.e. selecting the wrong source when matching two samples . due to the method of identifying the ps1 cepheid in phat from difference images",
    "this kind of mismatch should not be present in our sample .",
    "a misclassification of the cepheid type ( fundamental mode ( fm ) , first overtone ( fo ) and type ii ) or the identification of a different kind of variable as a cepheid can also lead to an outlier in the plr .    the cepheid type determined by k13 is biased by blending and crowding . separating fm and fo cepheids in m31 using ground - based observations",
    "is difficult .",
    "ideally , the type would be determined with near infrared light curves . for larger wavelengths",
    "the scatter in the plr is smaller because the temperature sensitivity on the surface brightness is smaller for longer wavelengths @xcite . even in hst data a cepheid that is clearly fo in the f160w plr scatters into the fm in the f814w plr .",
    "for this reason we exclude all unclassified cepheids from k13 from our sample .",
    "this leaves us with 447 cepheids in f110w and 415 cepheids in f160w .",
    "413 cepheids have photometry in both bands simultaneously .",
    "the typical photometric errors we get from dolphot are 0.003 mag .",
    "these are very small and do not account for the dispersion of the plr .",
    "the photometric errors are only one aspect that contributes to the dispersion .",
    "extinction and the inherent width of the plr due to the temperature dependence of the instability strip @xcite are other aspects . in the case of the wesenheit plr , different extinction laws for each cepheid would change @xmath9 ( equation [ eqn_wesenheit_2 ] ) and therefore increase the scatter in the plr .",
    "the photometric errors in r12 are also very small and as mentioned in e14 , @xcite add 0.21 mag in quadrature to the magnitude errors . an ordinary clipping",
    "routine without priors or rescaling of the magnitude errors performs very poorly .",
    "introducing priors and rescaling the errors works , but that either usually clips a large fraction of the data or the outlier rejection is unsatisfactory . testing this method we found no working compromise between clipping away way too much or almost nothing .",
    "the problem of outlier clipping and potential implications on the plr - biases has been recently investigated in detail by e14 . as pointed out by e14 that approach",
    "possibly underestimates the errors of the plr .",
    "additionally the combination of priors and strong clipping would prevent a study of the broken slope in our data as was done by @xcite for their bvi data . on the other hand stricter outlier rejection leads to less blending in the crowded central region of a galaxy @xcite",
    "we therefore develop a simple outlier rejection method that does not rely on any prior . in the first iteration of the algorithm we assign all measurements the same error and perform a linear fit .",
    "the error we assign in the first iteration is the average magnitude error .",
    "this ensures ( empirically ) that at least one cepheid is above the clipping threshold . after excluding the largest outlier to that fit we calculate the dispersion .",
    "for the next step we set the median of the absolute regression residuals ( median absolute deviation ; mad ) as the magnitude error .",
    "after the fit the worst outlier over a threshold of @xmath14 times the mad is rejected and the new mad is calculated .",
    "this is repeated until the procedure converges .",
    "this is a slightly modified @xmath14 - @xmath15 clipping with the mad for each magnitude error .",
    "another difference to a typical @xmath14 - @xmath15 clipping is that only the worst outlier is clipped in one iteration step .",
    "a normal @xmath14 - @xmath15 clipping without a prior to the slope of the plr can be heavily influenced by even a few outliers .",
    "these outliers could influence the plr fit in a way that the slope is somewhere between the real plr and the outliers .",
    "the normal @xmath14 - @xmath15 clipping would than clip both from the outliers and the real plr .",
    "clipping only one outlier in one iteration step ensures that an initially wrong plr fit gradually converges to the genuine plr and does not clip non outliers on the way .",
    "the reason for using the mad instead of the dispersion is that in this way it is possible to clip cepheids with a misclassified type , or spurious , or odd ( e.g. , polaris - like ) cepheids .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig_wesenheit_raw ] ) .",
    "we perform the outlier rejection in the wesenheit plr . as a consequence",
    "this means that we need both f110w and f160w photometry simultaneously and therefore our sample will consist of 413 cepheids ( fm , fo and type ii cepheids ) before the clipping is performed . the main reason for using the wesenheit function",
    "is to minimize the bias caused by extinction and to have a homogenous sample in both f110w and f160w .",
    "clipping in each filter separately could lead to a cepheid being rejected in one filter but not in the other .",
    "our @xmath16 clipped wesenheit plr can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_plr_wesenheit ] , while the clipped outliers can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_plr_wesenheit_outliers ] .",
    "the number of clipped cepheids is 42 ( 38 fm , 3 fo and 1 type ii ) , @xmath17 10% of the sample .",
    "as can be seen most of our outliers are too bright in respect to the best fit plr , which points to misclassification or blending .",
    "about half of the clipped fm cepheids rejected reside on the fo plr .",
    "most of the outliers at @xmath18 are most likely misclassified as fm instead of being classified as fo .",
    "indeed a lot of them are in a region of the amplitude ratio ( @xmath19 ) diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig_a21 ] ) populated by both fo and fm cepheids , which makes them difficult to classify .",
    "this is especially true when the light curves , as in our case , are determined from ground based observations in optical bands .",
    "crowding and blending will influence @xmath19 which contributes to the misclassification .",
    "blending will decrease amplitudes and the influence of crowding depends on the magnitude difference of the two sources ( c.f .",
    "[ fig_crowding ] ) .",
    "extinction does not influence the type classification since the classification in k13 only uses the fourier parameters of first and second order and the extinction only changes the zeroth order ( i.e. the mean magnitude ) .",
    "but the greatest contributing factor for the misclassification will be that fo cepheids populate more than the region characterized in the amplitude ratio diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig_a21 ] . to resolve this issue",
    "we would need spectroscopy or light curves in the near infrared ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "the two clipped sources with the largest periods are also in a transition region between fm and type ii in the phase difference diagram ( see right panel fig .",
    "9 , k13 ) and could therefore also be misclassified .",
    "e14 introduces an internal scatter @xmath20 to the @xmath21 minimization in order to obtain a @xmath21 of unity : @xmath22 the clipping is performed iteratively until convergence .",

    "this is not surprising since the sample is the same but for one fm cepheid that is additionally clipped by the e14 method . of course",
    "the threshold was also chosen such that both methods perform as identically as possible , while still using an integer value for the threshold .",
    "if we would not require the threshold to be integer , we could find a threshold that gives the same result as the mad clipping .",
    "using the same threshold for the fo cepheids as for the fm cepheids results in no clipping at all .",
    "the mad method on the other hand does only require one threshold for all cepheid types .",
    "the convergence of the internal scatter method is very sensitive to the threshold @xmath14 and the starting value of @xmath20 ( we chose @xmath24 ) . while the basic idea behind both methods is the same , namely increasing the error by a constant that is described by the dispersion , the method introduced by e14 requires one additional free parameter and according to our tests the convergence performance depends on the starting parameters .",
