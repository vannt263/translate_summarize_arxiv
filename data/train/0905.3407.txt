    "the explosive growth of large - scale wireless applications motivates people to study the fundamental limits over wireless networks .",
    "consider a randomly distributed wireless network with density @xmath0 over a unit area , where the nodes are randomly grouped into one - to - one source - destination ( s - d ) pairs .",
    "initiated by the seminal work in  @xcite , the throughput scaling laws for such a network have been studied extensively in the literature  @xcite-@xcite . for static networks",
    ", it is shown  @xcite that the traditional multi - hop transmission strategy can achieve a throughput scaling of @xmath9 means that there exists a constant @xmath10 and integer @xmath11 such that @xmath12 for @xmath13 ;",
    "ii ) @xmath14 means that @xmath15 ; iii ) @xmath16 means that @xmath17 and @xmath15 ; iv ) @xmath18 means that @xmath19 as @xmath20 . ] per s - d pair .",
    "such a throughput scaling can be improved when the nodes are able to move .",
    "it is shown in  @xcite  @xcite that a per - node throughput scaling of @xmath6 is achievable in mobile networks by exploring two - hop transmission schemes .",
    "unfortunately , the throughput improvement in mobile networks incurs a large packet delay  @xcite  @xcite , which is another important performance metric in wireless networks .",
    "in particular , it is shown in  @xcite that the constant per - node throughput is achieved at the cost of a delay scaling of @xmath21 .",
    "the delay - throughput tradeoffs for static and mobile networks have been investigated in  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "specifically , for static networks , it is shown in  @xcite that the optimal delay - throughput tradeoff is given by @xmath22 for @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the delay and throughput per s - d pair , respectively .",
    "the aforementioned literature mainly focuses on the delay and throughput scaling laws for a single network .",
    "recently , the emergence of cognitive radio networks motives people to extend the result from a single network to overlaid networks . consider a licensed primary network and a cognitive secondary network coexisting in a unit area .",
    "the primary network has the absolute priority to use the spectrum , while the secondary network can only access the spectrum opportunistically to limit the interference to the primary network .",
    "based on such assumptions , it is shown in  @xcite  @xcite that both networks can achieve the same throughput and delay scaling laws as a stand - alone network .",
    "however , such results are obtained without considering possible positive interactions between the primary network and the secondary network . in practice ,",
    "the secondary network , which is usually deployed after the existence of the primary network for opportunistic spectrum access , can transport data packets not only for itself but also for the primary network due to their cognitive nature .",
    "as such , it is meaningful to investigate whether the throughput and/or delay performance of the primary network ( whose protocol was fixed before the deployment of the secondary tier ) can be improved with the opportunistic aid of the secondary network , while assuming the secondary network still capable of keeping the same throughput and delay scaling laws as the case where no supportive actions are taken between the two networks .    in this paper , we define a _ supportive _ two - tier network with a primary tier and a secondary tier as follows : the secondary tier is allowed to supportively relay the data packets for the primary tier in an opportunistic way ( i.e. , the secondary users only utilize empty spectrum holes in between primary transmissions even when they are relaying the primary packets ) , whereas the primary tier is only required to transport its own data .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath26 denote the node densities of the primary tier and the secondary tier , respectively .",
    "we investigate the throughput and delay scaling laws for such a supportive two - tier network with @xmath2 in the following two scenarios : i ) the primary and secondary nodes are all static ; ii ) the primary nodes are static while the secondary nodes are mobile . with specialized protocols for the secondary tier ,",
    "we show that the primary tier can achieve a per - node throughput scaling of @xmath3 in the above two scenarios with a classic time - slotted multi - hop transmission protocol similar to the one in  @xcite . in the associated delay analysis for the first scenario ,",
    "we show that the primary tier can achieve a delay scaling of @xmath4 with @xmath5 . in the second scenario , with two mobility models considered for the secondary nodes : an i.i.d .",
    "mobility model and a random walk model , we show that the primary tier can achieve delay scaling laws of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , where @xmath8 is the random walk step size .",
    "the throughput and delay scaling laws for the secondary tier are also established , which are the same as those for a stand - alone network .",
    "based on the fact that an opportunistic supportive secondary tier improves the performance of the primary tier , we make the following observation : the classic time - slotted multi - hop primary protocol  @xcite does not fully utilize the spatial / temporal resource such that a cognitive secondary tier with denser nodes could explore the under - utilized segments to conduct nontrivial networking duties .    note that in  @xcite , the authors also pointed out that adding a large amount of extra pure relay nodes ( which only relay traffic for other nodes ) , the throughput scaling can be improved at the cost of excessive network deployment .",
    "however , there are two key differences between such a statement in  @xcite and our results . first , in this paper , the added extra relays ( the secondary nodes ) only access spectrum opportunistically",
    "( i.e. , they need not to be allocated with primary spectrum resource , given their cognitive nature ) , while the extra relay nodes mentioned in  @xcite are regular primary nodes ( just without generating their own traffic ) who need to be assigned with certain primary spectrum resource in the same way as other primary nodes . as such ,",
    "based on the cognitive features of the secondary nodes considered in this paper , the primary throughput improvement could be achieved in an existing primary network without the need to change its current protocol ; while in  @xcite , the extra relay deployment has to be considered in the initial primary network design phase for its protocol to utilize the relays . in other words ,",
    "the problem considered in this paper is how to improve the throughput scaling over an existing primary network by adding another supportive network tier ( the secondary cognitive tier ) , where the primary network is already running a certain protocol as we will discuss later in the paper , which is different from the networking scenario considered in  @xcite .",
    "second , in this paper , the extra relays are also source nodes on their own ( i.e. , they also initiate and support their own traffic within the secondary tier ) , and as one of the main results , we will show that even with their help to improve the primary - tier throughput , these extra relays ( i.e. , the secondary tier ) could also achieve the same throughput scaling for their own traffic as a stand - alone network considered in  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model is described and the main results are summarized in section ii .",
    "the proposed protocols for the primary and secondary tiers are described in section iii . the delay and throughput scaling laws for the primary tier",
    "are derived in section iv . the delay and throughput scaling laws for the secondary tier",
    "are studied in section v. finally , section vi summarizes our conclusions .",
    "consider a two - tier network with a static primary tier and a denser secondary tier over a unit square .",
    "we assume that the nodes of the primary tier , so - called primary nodes , are static , and consider the following two scenarios : i ) the nodes of the secondary tier , so - called secondary nodes , are also static ; ii ) the secondary nodes are mobile .",
    "we first describe the network model , the interaction model between the two tiers , the mobility models for the mobile secondary nodes in the second scenario , and the definitions of throughput and delay .",
    "then we summarize the main results in terms of the delay and throughput scaling laws for the proposed two - tier network .",
    "the primary nodes are distributed according to a poisson point process ( ppp ) of density @xmath0 and randomly grouped into one - to - one source - destination ( s - d ) pairs .",
    "likewise , the secondary nodes are distributed according to a ppp of density @xmath27 and randomly grouped into s - d pairs .",
    "we assume that the density of the secondary tier is higher than that of the primary tier , i.e. , @xmath28 where we consider the case with @xmath2 . the primary tier and the secondary tier share the same time , frequency , and space , but with different priorities to access the spectrum : the former one is the licensed user of the spectrum and thus has a higher priority ; and the latter one can only opportunistically access the spectrum to limit the resulting interference to the primary tier , even when it helps with relaying the primary packets .    for the wireless channel",
    ", we only consider the large - scale pathloss and ignore the effects of shadowing and small - scale multipath fading . as such",
    ", the channel power gain @xmath29 is given as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the distance between the transmitter ( tx ) and the corresponding receiver ( rx ) , and @xmath32 denotes the pathloss exponent .",
    "the ambient noise is assumed to be additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) with an average power @xmath33 . during each time slot , we assume that each tx - rx pair utilizes a capacity - achieving scheme with the data rate of the @xmath34th primary tx - rx pair given by @xmath35 where the channel bandwidth is normalized to be unity for simplicity , @xmath36 denotes the norm operation , @xmath37 is the transmit power of the @xmath34th primary pair , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the tx and rx locations of @xmath34th primary pair , respectively , @xmath40 is the sum interference from all other primary txs , @xmath41 is the sum interference from all the secondary txs . likewise ,",
    "the data rate of the @xmath42th secondary tx - rx pair is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the transmit power of the @xmath42th secondary pair , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the tx and rx locations of the @xmath42th secondary pair , respectively , @xmath47 is the sum interference from all other secondary txs to the rx of the @xmath42th secondary pair , and @xmath48 is the sum interference from all primary txs .      as shown in the previous work  @xcite  @xcite",
    ", although the opportunistic data transmission in the secondary tier does not degrade the scaling law of the primary tier , it may reduce the throughput in the primary tier by a constant factor due to the fact that the interference from the secondary tier to the primary tier can not be reduced to zero . to completely compensate the throughput degradation or even improve the throughput scaling law of the primary tier in the two - tier setup , we could allow certain positive interactions between the two tiers .",
    "specifically , we assume that the secondary nodes are willing to act as relay nodes for the primary tier , while the primary nodes are not assumed to do so .",
    "when a primary source node transmits packets , the surrounding secondary nodes could pretend to be primary nodes to relay the packets ( which is feasible since they are software - programmable cognitive radios ) . in the scenario where the primary and secondary nodes are all static ,",
    "the secondary nodes chop the received primary packets into smaller pieces suitable for secondary - tier transmissions .",
    "the small data pieces will be reassembled before they are delivered to the primary destination nodes . in the scenario where the secondary nodes are mobile , the received packets are stored in the secondary nodes and delivered to the corresponding primary destination node only when the secondary nodes move into the neighboring area of the primary destination node . as such , the primary tier is expected to achieve better throughput and/or delay scaling laws .",
    "more details can be found in the secondary protocols proposed in section iii .",
    "note that , these `` fake '' primary nodes do not have the same priority as the real primary nodes in terms of spectrum access , i.e. , they can only use the spectrum opportunistically in the same way as a regular secondary node .",
    "the assumption that the secondary tier is allowed to relay the primary packets is the essential difference between our model and the models in  @xcite  @xcite .      in the scenario where the secondary nodes are mobile , we assume that the positions of the primary nodes are fixed whereas the secondary nodes stay static in one primary time slot and change their positions at the next slot .",
    "in particular , we consider the following two mobility models for the secondary nodes .    *",
    "two - dimensional i.i.d . mobility model *  @xcite : the secondary nodes are uniformly and randomly distributed in the unit area at each primary time slot .",
    "the node locations are independent of each other , and independent from time slot to time slot , i.e. , the nodes are totally reshuffled over each primary time slot .    * two - dimensional random walk ( rw ) model *  @xcite  @xcite : we divide the unit square into @xmath49 small - square rw - cells , each of them with size @xmath8 . the rw - cells are indexed by @xmath50 , where @xmath51 .",
    "a secondary node that stays in a rw - cell at a particular primary time slot will move to one of its eight neighboring rw - cells at the next slot with equal probability ( i.e. , 1/8 ) . for the convenience of analysis ,",
    "when a secondary node hits the boundary of the unit square , we assume that it jumps over the opposite edge to eliminate the edge effect  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "the nodes within a rw - cell are uniformly and randomly distributed .",
    "note that the unit square are also divided into primary cells and secondary cells in the proposed protocols as discussed in section iii , which are different from the rw - cells defined above . in this paper",
    ", we only consider the case where the size of the rw - cell is greater than or equal to that of the primary cell .",
    "the _ throughput per s - d pair _ ( per - node throughput ) is defined as the average data rate that each source node can transmit to its chosen destination as in  @xcite  @xcite , which is asymptotically determined by the network density .",
    "besides , the _ sum throughput _ is defined as the product between the throughput per s - d pair and the number of s - d pairs in the network .",
    "in the following , we use @xmath52 and @xmath53 to denote the throughputs per s - d pair for the primary tier and the secondary tier , respectively ; and we use @xmath54 and @xmath55 to denote the sum throughputs for the primary tier and the secondary tier , respectively .    the delay of a primary packet is defined as the average number of primary time slots that it takes to reach the primary destination node after the departure from the primary source node .",
    "similarly , we define the delay of a secondary packet as the average number of secondary time slots for the packet to travel from the secondary source node to the secondary destination node .",
    "we use @xmath56 and @xmath57 to denote packet delays for the primary tier and the secondary tier , respectively .",
    "for simplicity , we use a fluid model  @xcite for the delay analysis , in which we divide each time slot to multiple packet slots and the size of the data packets can be scaled down with the increase of network density .",
    "we summarize the main results in terms of the throughput and delay scaling laws for the supportive two - tier network here .",
    "we first present the results for the scenario where the primary and secondary nodes are all static and then describe the results for the scenario with mobile secondary nodes .",

    "mobility model and the rw mobility model , respectively .",
    "in this section , we describe the proposed protocols for the primary tier and the secondary tier , respectively .",
    "the primary tier deploys a modified time - slotted multi - hop transmission scheme from those for the primary network in  @xcite  @xcite , while the secondary tier chooses its protocol according to the given primary transmission scheme . in the following , we use @xmath63 to represent the probability of event @xmath64 , and claim that an event @xmath65 occurs with high probability ( w.h.p . ) if @xmath66 as @xmath67 .",
    "the main sketch of the primary protocol is given as follows :    \\i ) divide the unit square into small - square primary cells with size @xmath68 . in order to maintain the full connectivity within the primary tier even without the aid of the secondary tier and enable the possible support from the secondary tier",
    "( see _ theorem 1 _ for details ) , we have @xmath69 such that each cell has at least one primary node w.h.p ..",
    "\\ii ) group every @xmath70 primary cells into a primary cluster .",
    "the cells in each primary cluster take turns to be active in a round - robin fashion .",
    "we divide the transmission time into tdma frames , where each frame has @xmath70 primary time slots that correspond to the number of cells in each primary cluster .",
    "note that the number of primary cells in a primary cluster has to satisfy @xmath71 such that we can appropriately arrange the preservation regions and the collection regions , which will be formally defined later in the secondary protocol . for convenience , we take @xmath72 throughout the paper .",
    "\\iii ) define the s - d data path along which the packets are routed from the source node to the destination node : the data path follows a horizontal line and a vertical line connecting the source node and the destination node , which is the same as that defined in  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "pick an arbitrary node within a primary cell as the designated relay node , which is responsible for relaying the packets of all the data paths passing through the cell .",
    "\\iv ) when a primary cell is active , each primary source node in it takes turns to transmit one of its own packets with probability @xmath73 .",
    "afterwards , the designated relay node transmits one packet for each of the s - d paths passing through the cell .",
    "the above packet transmissions follow a time - slotted pattern within the active primary time slot , which is divided into packet slots .",
    "each source node reserves a packet slot no matter it transmits or not .",
    "if the designated relay node has no packets to transmit , it does not reserve any packet slots . for each packet , if the destination node is found in the adjacent cell , the packet will be directly delivered to the destination .",
    "otherwise , the packet is forwarded to the designated relay node in the adjacent cell along the data path . at each packet transmission ,",
    "the tx node transmits with power of @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is a constant .",
    "\\v ) we assume that all the packets for each s - d pair are labelled with serial numbers ( sns ) .",
    "the following handshake mechanism is used when a tx node is scheduled to transmit a packet to a destination node : the tx sends a request message to initiate the process ; the destination node replies with the desired sn ; if the tx has the packet with the desired sn , it will send the packet to the destination node ; otherwise , it stays idle . as we will see in the proposed secondary protocol for the scenario with mobile secondary nodes",
    ", the helping secondary relay nodes will take advantage of the above handshake mechanism to remove the outdated ( already - delivered ) primary packets from their queues .",
    "we assume that the length of the handshake message is negligible compared to that of the primary data packet in the throughput analysis for the primary tier as discussed in section iv .",
    "note that running of the above protocol for the primary tier is independent of whether the secondary tier is present or not .",
    "when the secondary tier is absent , the primary tier can achieve the throughput scaling law as a stand - alone network discussed in  @xcite .",
    "when the secondary tier is present as shown in section iv , the primary tier can achieve a better throughput scaling law with the aid of the secondary tier .      in the following , we first present the proposed secondary protocol for the scenario with static secondary nodes , and then describe the one for the scenario with mobile secondary nodes .",
    "* protocol for static secondary tier *        we assume that the secondary nodes have the necessary cognitive features such as software - programmability to `` pretend '' as primary nodes such that they could be chosen as the designated primary relay nodes within a particular primary cell . as later shown by _",

    "furthermore , we use the time - sharing technique to guarantee successful packet deliveries from the secondary nodes to the primary destination nodes as follows .",
    "we divide each secondary frame into three equal - length subframes , such that each of them has the same length as one primary time slot as shown in  fig .",
    "[ frame ] .",
    "the first subframe is used to transmit the secondary packets within the secondary tier .",
    "the second subframe is used to relay the primary packets to the next relay nodes .",
    "accordingly , the third subframe of each secondary frame is used to deliver the primary packets from the intermediate destination nodes in the secondary tier to their final destination nodes in the primary tier .",
    "specifically , for the first subframe , we use the following protocol :    * divide the unit area into square secondary cells with size @xmath76 . in order to maintain the full connectivity within the secondary tier",
    ", we have to guarantee @xmath77 with a similar argument to that in the primary tier .",
    "* group the secondary cells into secondary clusters , with each secondary cluster of 64 cells .",
    "each secondary cluster also follows a 64-tdma pattern to communicate , which means that the first subframe is divided into 64 secondary time slots . *",
    "define a preservation region as nine primary cells centered at an active primary tx and a layer of secondary cells around them , shown as the square with dashed edges in fig .",
    "[ preservation ] . only the secondary txs in an active secondary cell outside",
    "all the preservation regions can transmit data packets ; otherwise , they buffer the packets until the particular preservation region is cleared . when an active secondary cell is outside the preservation regions in the first subframe , it allows the transmission of one packet for each secondary source node and for each s - d path passing through the cell in a time - slotted pattern within the active secondary time slot w.h.p .. the routing of secondary packets follows similarly defined data paths as those in the primary tier . * at each transmission , the active secondary tx node can only transmit to a node in its adjacent cells with power of @xmath78 .    in the second subframe ,",
    "only secondary nodes who carry primary packets take the time resource to transmit .",
    "note that each primary packet is broadcasted from the primary source node to its neighboring primary cells where we assume that there are @xmath11 secondary nodes in the neighboring cell along the primary data path successfully decode the packet and ready to relay .",
    "in particular , each secondary node relays @xmath79 portion of the primary packet to the intermediate destination node in a multi - hop fashion , and the value of @xmath11 is set as @xmath80 from _ lemma 1 _ in section iv , we can guarantee that there are more than @xmath11 secondary nodes in each primary cell w.h.p .",
    "when @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath81 , the number of the secondary nodes in each primary cell is less than @xmath11 w.h.p .. in this regime , the proposed protocols could be modified by using the maximum number of the secondary nodes in the neighboring primary cell of a primary tx along the s - d data path .",
    "we leave this issue in our future work .",

    "the received primary packet segments are reassembled into the original primary packets .",
    "then in the third subframe , we use the following protocol to deliver the packets to the primary destination nodes :    * define a collection region as nine primary cells and a layer of secondary cells around them , shown as the square with dotted edges in fig .",
    "[ preservation ] , where the collection region is located between two preservation regions along the horizontal line and they are not overlapped with each other . *",

    "the primary destination nodes in the sink cell take turns to receive data by following a time - slotted pattern , where the corresponding intermediate destination node in the collection region transmits by pretending as a primary tx node .",
    "given that the third subframe is of an equal length to one primary slot , each primary destination node in the sink cell can receive one primary packet from the corresponding intermediate destination node .",
    "* at each transmission , the intermediate destination node transmits with the same power as that for a primary node , i.e. , @xmath82 .",
