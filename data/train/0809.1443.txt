    "there is now overwhelming evidence that the vast majority of massive early - type galaxies harbor a supermassive black hole ( bh ) at their centers , and that bhs play an important role during the assembly and evolution of their host galaxies ( see reviews in @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of the @xmath8 correlation between bh mass and central stellar velocity dispersion links the growth of the bh with the formation of the host bulge @xcite , perhaps through feedback mechanisms associated with an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "the detection of bhs can be achieved by several methods , including direct kinematics of surrounding gas and stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and optical spectroscopic identification of nuclear emission lines originating from an agn ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the first method is limited to nearby , inactive or mildly active galaxies , however , while optical spectroscopic identification is generally limited to moderately bright nuclei that are not strongly confused by circumnuclear star formation or heavily obscured by dust .",
    "an extensive spectroscopic survey of nearby galaxies has revealed that approximately @xmath9% of galaxies of hubble type e ",
    "sb contain an agn @xcite , broadly consistent with the idea that bhs are ubiquitous in these systems @xcite . for types",
    "later than sc , where classical bulges disappear @xcite , only @xmath10% of galaxies show optical agn activity .",
    "this leads to the notion that classical bulges or ellipticals are necessary for bh formation .",
    "there are , however , a few striking counter examples .",
    "ngc4395 , an essentially bulgeless sm galaxy , exhibits all the hallmarks of a seyfert 1 nucleus @xcite , and it has a bh mass of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "pox52 shares an almost identical optical spectrum to ngc4395 , but is hosted in a spheroidal galaxy @xcite , a visually similar but distinct morphological type compared to elliptical galaxies or classical bulges .",
    "more recently , an agn was discovered in ngc3621 , a late - type sd galaxy , using infrared spectroscopic observations @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the nearby scd galaxy m33 has a firm upper limit on the mass of any central dark object of @xmath12 @xcite , far below the typical @xmath13 bhs found in galaxies such as ngc4395 .",
    "thus bhs can indeed exist in bulgeless systems , but exactly how common such systems are remains unknown .    from a spectral analysis of sdss data ,",
    "@xcite have found a population of low - mass bhs ( @xmath14@xmath15 ) accreting at appreciable eddington ratios .",
    "the host galaxies from the initial sample of 19 sources @xcite , using _ hst _ imaging ,",
    "are found to be mid- to late - type spirals or spheroidals similar to pox52 @xcite .",
    "none are as late - type as ngc4395 , however , and so the incidence of bhs in very late - type systems remains uncertain .    for such systems",
    ", there is also the possibility that bhs are replaced by nuclear star clusters ( ncs ) .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite suggest that bhs in the @xmath8 relation are replaced by compact massive objects at low mass , with a generalized correlation @xmath16 .",
    "such compact objects could include ncs instead of bhs , commonly found in late - type spirals @xcite .",
    "it is therefore not immediately obvious that such late - type spirals _ should _ contain bhs .",
    "establishing a bh census for late - type spirals is important to determine if bhs are indeed formed in earlier - type galaxies only ( ellipticals or early - type spirals ) , or if they also exist in very late - type galaxies .",
    "one complication in late - type spirals is the abundance of gas and dust , with strong levels of star formation . if these systems contain bhs , they are likely to be of relatively low mass , and hence the agn , even when fully active , will be of quite low luminosity . while the mere presence of an agn indicates a bh , energetically weak or heavily embedded agns are extraordinarily difficult to observe , particularly at optical wavelengths where most of these observations have historically occurred .",
    "dust obscuration severely attenuates optical and ultraviolet flux , and central star formation can dominate the optical / infrared emission .",
    "x - ray observations allow us to peer through the obscuring gas and dust column , since high column densities are required to suppress x - ray flux ( particularly energetic x - rays ) .",
    "x - ray detections are therefore a useful indicator of agn activity , and since the launch of the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ , the sensitivity with which to carry out such studies has been greatly improved . in particular , the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; @xcite ) provides better than 05 resolution with very low background contamination ( @xmath17 counts pix@xmath6 sec@xmath6 between 0.5 and 8 kev ) .",
    "this allows low flux limits to be achieved with very short ( few ks ) exposures , enabling surveys of non - x - ray selected samples @xcite . @xcite",
    "have used x - ray detections successfully to identify bhs in low - mass bulges , and have begun to establish statistics on agn x - ray activity as a function of host bulge mass .",
    "x - ray observations have also been useful in searching for nuclear activity in quiescent ( i.e. optically faint ) bhs residing in massive elliptical galaxies @xcite , and in star - forming early - type spiral galaxies @xcite .    in this paper we investigate the nuclear activity in a sample of late - type spiral galaxies using archival _",
    "chandra _ data , which provide a clearer method of detecting agn activity in such star formation - dominated , potentially heavily obscured environments .",
    "systems with nuclear x - ray detections coincident with the optical nucleus are identified as agn candidates , and after considering the possible contamination of our results from x - ray binaries , we estimate the prevalence of agns in late - type spiral galaxies . we discuss our sample selection in   [ sec : sample ] and our results in   [ sec : results ] .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of possible non - agn sources and directions for future work in   [ sec : disc ] .",
    "all data were obtained from the _ chandra _ data archive , with the full list summarized in table  [ tab : log ] .",
    "we initially selected objects from the palomar spectroscopic survey of nearby galaxies @xcite with morphological @xmath0 types between 6.0 and 9.0 ( representing hubble types scd to sm ; i.e. bulgeless or nearly bulgeless spiral galaxies ) , which were available in the archive .",
    "the palomar survey contains the most sensitive and comprehensive statistics on local agns to date , but the reliability of optically derived statistics in late - type spirals is uncertain due to dust and star formation contamination . we can therefore complement the survey with x - ray data . out of 63 objects in the palomar survey with @xmath0 types between 6.0 and 9.0 ,",
    "33 are present in the _ chandra _ archives .",
    "the 33 palomar objects in our sample have a median absolute magnitude of @xmath18 ( corrected for galactic and internal extinction ) , and a median distance of 7.8 mpc .",
    "if we do not restrict ourselves to palomar objects , we can expand our sample significantly . from the master list of all public _ chandra _ observations ( as of may 2008 ) , we searched for any galaxies in the hyperleda database within 4  of the aimpoint ( i.e. half a chip size for acis - s ) . after restricting our search to objects with @xmath0 type between 6.0 and 9.0 @xcite and within 30 mpc @xcite",
    ", our sample grows to 64 objects .",
    "these palomar and non - palomar subsamples are denoted by `` p '' and `` c , '' respectively , in table  [ tab : log ] .",
    "when multiple observations exist for a given object , we generally chose the longest acis - s exposure if possible , otherwise opting for the newest observation . in two cases",
    "acis - s images were not available .",
    "for m33 , we chose the hrc - s observation , since the detector does not suffer from pileup as a result of the high count rate ( see below for more discussion on pileup ) .    because our sample is selected only on the basis of availability within the _ chandra _ data archive , there is a potential for selection biases ( based on , for instance , the selection criteria of the original proposals)although these objects were not necessarily targeted for their nuclear properties . in figure",
    "[ fig : ttypes ] we compare the distributions of @xmath0 type between our sample and the original sample of 63 palomar objects from @xcite .",
    "the distributions agree reasonably well , although our sample is perhaps weighted slightly toward the most late - type spirals ( i.e. @xmath0 = 9.0 ) .    with two exceptions ,",
    "all data were obtained using the _ chandra _ acis detector , in either the i- or s - array .",
    "the i - array consists of 4 ccds arranged for imaging , while the s - array consists of 6 ccds used for either imaging or grating spectroscopy .",
    "the mirror assembly has a point - spread function ( psf ) with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 05 , equal to the acis pixel size . at a distance of 10 mpc",
    ", this corresponds to a physical scale of @xmath725 pc .",
    "two objects were observed with the high resolution camera ( hrc ) , which has 04 pixels .",
    "we used type 2 event files output by standard pipeline processing .",
    "we used 0.28 kev counts in our analysis , limiting background contamination at high energies .",
    "all data were corrected for known astrometry offsets , following standard ciao threads[multiblock footnote omitted ] ( using ciao version 3.3 ) .",
    "we then used celldetect , with default parameters , to automatically find all point sources within each image and determine the centroids .",
    "these detections have absolute astrometry accurate to 1 , although it can be marginally worse for off - axis objects with larger psfs and few counts . from these centroids , we measured background - subtracted counts in a 2  radius aperture using the ciao task dmextract , with a background annulus ranging from 5  to 10 . in some cases , the background region was slightly altered to avoid nearby point sources . for ngc3079 and 4945 ,",
    "the aperture is 1  to avoid nearby sources and strong background , and for ngc3184 the aperture is 3  since this object is far off - axis ( and thus has a large psf ) .",
    "a 2  aperture ensures that we measure virtually all of the point source counts , since the on - axis psf of _ chandra _ contains 95% of the encircled energy with 1 .    finally , we used two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) positions ( obtained from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database , ned ) , with typical @xmath19 uncertainties of @xmath705  for the photometric center of _ extended _ sources @xcite , to determine whether x - ray point - source detections were coincident with the nucleus . while the nominal accuracy for 2mass is often quoted as 01 , this only applies to point sources .",
    "the distribution of offsets between the nearest x - ray detection and photometric center from 2mass is highly bimodal , and we chose to consider objects belonging to the smaller - offset group as agn candidates .",
    "our formal criterion requires that the 2mass positions and x - ray detections lie within 5  of each other . in practice almost all candidates have better than 25 agreement , while nearly all non - detections have no x - ray point sources within 10  of the 2mass position .",
    "( ngc4625 has an x - ray source within 6  of the optical nucleus , while ngc3395 , ngc3556 , ngc4038 , and ngc4631 have an x - ray source within 10  of the optical nucleus . )",
    "the minimum x - ray signal - to - noise ( s / n ) threshold accepted was 1.5 , although in practice only three sources were detected with such low s / n .",
    "we detected 18 x - ray point sources in our sample of 64 objects ; 12 sources with s / n @xmath2 3 , three sources with 3 @xmath2 s / n @xmath2 2 , and three sources with 2 @xmath2 s / n @xmath2 1.5 .    for all agn candidates except ic342 , m33 , ngc55 , and ngc4395 , we estimate the total x - ray luminosity similarly to @xcite , assuming a photon index of @xmath20 , typical of most low - luminosity agns ( see @xcite ) , and an average galactic interstellar medium column density of @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "this gives @xmath3(210 kev ) @xmath23 ergs s@xmath6 ( acis counts ks@xmath6 ) ( @xmath24/10 mpc)@xmath25 .",
    "this is only valid , however , for acis - s data . for ic342 and ngc55 ( i.e. hrc - i and acis - i data ) , we use the pimms tool ( version 3.9d ) with the same assumptions to obtain the 210 kev luminosity .",
    "the luminosities would increase by a factor of 1.8 and 6.7 for intrinsic column densities of obscuring gas and dust of @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xmath22 , respectively . for m33 ( hrc - s data )",
    ", we again use pimms but assume @xmath28 @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "ngc4395 is a known agn with strong absorption ( @xmath29 @xmath22 ; @xcite ) , and so we use this value instead to estimate @xmath3 .",
    "none of our acis objects suffer from significant pileup ( multiple detections of lower energy photons within a single frame time that is registered as a single event at higher energy , possibly even rejected as a cosmic ray hit ) .",
    "ngc4395 has the highest count rate of @xmath30 counts s@xmath6 , which corresponds to a pileup of only 2% ( calculated using pimms ) , roughly equal to the measured uncertainty in total counts .",
    "we obtained an upper limit for those sources without an x - ray point - source detection .",
    "we used a circular aperture with a 2  radius , centered at the optical position of the nucleus .",
    "we measured the background counts with its uncertainty , and determined the counts necessary for a theoretical source to have a s / n equal to 1.5 and thus be detected by celldetect .",
    "these counts were then converted to a luminosity as described above . in some cases , because of the very low exposure times , no counts were detected in this aperture size . in these cases , we used larger apertures and scaled down to a 2  aperture , up to a 12  aperture in the most extreme cases .",
    "fields were sparse enough that no contamination from nearby x - ray point sources was present .",
    "for objects with a detected x - ray point source , the limiting luminosity was similarly found using the background measurements , scaled to a 2  aperture .    as a proxy for spectral shape ,",
    "we compute x - ray colors for those objects with detected x - ray sources , with counts measured in three bands : soft ( @xmath31 , 0.31 kev ) , medium ( @xmath32 , 12 kev ) , and hard ( @xmath33 , 28 kev ) .",
    "the soft and hard colors are then defined to be @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , where @xmath0 is the total counts in all three bands .",
    "this was only achievable with acis data , which have accurate registration of incoming photon energy , whereas the hrc instrument has a spectral resolution of only @xmath36 .",
    "four objects in our sample have sufficient counts ( i.e. @xmath37 ) to do a preliminary spectral analysis : ngc4039 , ngc4395 , ngc4490 , and ngc6946 .",
    "ngc4945 has most of its counts in a strong fe k@xmath38 feature at 6.4 kev , resulting in few continuum photons . to accomplish this analysis",
    ", we used the ciao task psextract to extract the x - ray spectra along with the associated response files .",
    "the aperture and background used are the same as those for the x - ray photometry .",
    "bins are selected to have a minimum of 20 counts .",
    "using xspec @xcite , we then fit simple models to the data , ignoring bins with energies below 0.3 kev and above 5 kev ( where there are few counts ) . in the case of ngc4395 , a strong source , we ignored bins with energies below 1 kev ( there is a soft excess at low energies ; see also @xcite ) and above 10 kev .",
    "we tested various models , including an absorbed power law , a blackbody , and an absorbed power law + blackbody .",
    "out of our sample of 64 objects , we detect 18 sources coincident with the optical position of the nucleus .",
    "we consider these as agn candidates ( except for m33 , which we discuss in section  [ sec : disc ] ) . our full sample is summarized in table  [ tab : log ] , while the agn candidates are summarized in table  [ tab : agn ] , along with their measured x - ray colors .",
    "their images are presented in figure  [ fig : images ] .",
    "of the 17 candidates , three objects are known agns from optical diagnostics ( ngc3079 , ngc4395 , and ngc4945 , although they are weak sources ) , and one more is a known low - ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ; ngc6503 ) .",
    "ngc4654 , ngc4701 and ngc5457 were detected above a s / n of 1.5 .",

    "the rest of the agn candidates were detected with a s / n above 3 .",
    "ngc45 has a possible nuclear x - ray source coincident with the optical position , but it was not detected above a s / n of 1.5 , and thus is not included in our candidate list .",
    "the 17 agn candidates have 210 kev luminosities ranging from @xmath39 to @xmath5 ergs s@xmath6 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath3 is shown in figure  [ fig : lx ] .",
    "the three known agns ( ngc3079 , ngc4395 , and ngc4945 ) have @xmath40 , @xmath5 , and @xmath41 ergs s@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the median offset between the x - ray detection and the optical / near - infrared position is @xmath1 = 16 .",
    "for those objects with enough counts , our x - ray spectral fits are summarized in table  [ tab : spectra ] and figure  [ fig : spectra ] , and are discussed below .    for the agn candidates with available measurements of @xmath42 in the literature",
    ", we estimate a possible bh mass using the @xmath8 relation of @xcite .",
    "we also estimate the corresponding x - ray luminosity to eddington luminosity ratio . these are presented in table  [ tab : agn ] .",
    "the evidence for the majority of these candidates being true agns is circumstantial . for most of these systems , the physical scale of an x - ray point source in _ chandra _ data is of order tens of parsecs , making it extremely unlikely that the vast majority of detections are serendipitous field x - ray binaries along the line of sight to or near the nucleus .",
    "furthermore , the probability of detecting a background / foreground x - ray source within the _ chandra _ psf is extremely low , of order @xmath43 @xcite . with a few exceptions ,",
    "the positional agreement between the x - ray source and the 2mass position of the nucleus is excellent ( less than 2 , compared to the _ chandra _ and 2mass positional uncertainties of @xmath71 ) .",
    "ngc4945 has a larger offset ( @xmath44 32 ) , but the presence of bright diffuse x - ray emission makes point - source detection more challenging , and once again this object is a known seyfert 2 .    many of these galaxies have  nuclei as identified in the palomar survey , but most of the optical observations have slit apertures of @xmath45 @xcite , much larger than the _",
    "the palomar data are therefore probing a much larger region than the x - ray point sources , and we must be careful when making comparisons . as these are gas- and dust - rich systems , there is clearly some level of star formation in the circumnuclear region . if we consider , for example",
    ", typical  luminosities emitted by such low - luminosity agns , they are significantly lower than the measured  luminosities in the palomar data . assuming the bolometric , x - ray , and  luminosities of agns are related by @xmath46 @xcite , a range @xmath47 ",

    "palomar objects in our sample with  nuclei have @xmath51",
    " @xmath52 ergs s@xmath6 , which can explain why such low - luminosity agns , if present , were missed in the palomar data .",
    "the galaxies in our sample are low - mass , late - type spirals , and thus likely harbor a nc at the center of the gravitational potential well .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath775% of late - type spirals ( @xmath0 = 69 ) host a compact , photometrically distinct source located near the photometric center of the galaxy , with the surface brightness profile deviating from a pure disk profile .",
    "these ncs have mean effective radii of @xmath53 pc and @xmath54-band luminosities of @xmath55 .",
    "@xcite found that for ncs in galaxies within a similar range in @xmath0 type , the average cluster mass is @xmath56 .",
    "the increased stellar density at the center therefore implies an increased chance of detecting , in particular , a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) as a nuclear x - ray point source , confusing our results .",
    "m33 , for example , likely has no central massive bh @xcite , but does possess an x - ray source coincident with the optical nucleus , with properties suggestive of an x - ray binary @xcite .",
    "this is why we do not included m33 as part of our agn candidates .",
    "ngc2403 also hosts an x - ray binary in its known nuclear star cluster @xcite , although the x - ray luminosity is not high enough to be confused with an agn ( in this work , no detection was found above the limiting luminosity of @xmath57 ergs s@xmath6 ) .",
    "x - ray binaries must therefore be carefully considered when attempting to detect low - luminosity agns .",
    "although ncs also occur frequently in more massive early - type spiral galaxies @xcite and intermediate - luminosity elliptical galaxies @xcite , lmxb contamination is not important in these cases because at these larger bh masses @xmath58 ergs s@xmath6 due to nuclear activity , much greater than typical lmxb x - ray luminosities .",
    "an x - ray detection in a nc is much more likely to be a lmxb rather than a high - mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) because the mean age of ncs in late - type hosts is @xmath59 yrs @xcite , older than typical high - mass stars in hmxbs .",
    "although many late - type galaxies have  nuclei @xcite , the slit aperture used , in most cases , is significantly larger than the _ chandra _ psf .",
    "given that nearly all galaxies in the survey exhibit some emission lines in their nuclear spectra , and that late - type galaxies in particular are gas and dust rich with strong levels of star formation , the prevalence of  nuclei is not surprising .",
    "this does not necessarily imply , however , that the ncs have ongoing star formation ( and therefore hmxbs are more likely ) , as evidenced by the inferred nc ages from @xcite .    for our purposes",
    ", we will approximate the ncs as globular clusters ( gcs ) in order to estimate the incidence of lmxbs .",
    "although the environments of both types of clusters are widely different , ncs and gcs share remarkably similar structural and dynamical properties .",
    "viewed in the fundamental plane ( relating effective radius , surface density , and velocity dispersion ) , ncs occupy a region very distinct from classical bulges and elliptical galaxies , and fall on the high - mass extension of the gc sequence @xcite . with some important exceptions ( see below ) , approximating ncs as gcs is therefore well justified .        the quantity @xmath63 specifies the corrected half - mass radius , where @xmath64}$ ] .",
    "since this depends rather weakly on color , we can approximate @xmath65 pc as a mean value for ncs in late - type spirals .",

    "this gives @xmath61 colors ranging from 1.05 to 1.17 mag ; we adopt @xmath69 mag",
    ". therefore the mean number of lmxbs we expect is @xmath70 .",
    "this estimate is specifically for sources brighter than @xmath71 ergs s@xmath6 , which corresponds to the completeness limit of @xcite .",

    "however , they detected only a factor of a few more sources .",
    "an important caveat to this estimate is the question of stellar age .",
    "gcs generally have old stellar populations , formed via a single burst of star formation , whereas ncs have repeated star formation episodes since the reservoir of gas can be replenished .",
    "this leads to , for a given cluster mass , a younger mean stellar age for ncs compared to gcs , and thus bluer colors @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the expected number of lmxbs estimated above is an upper limit , since it was derived for gcs , and the true number of lmxbs in ncs is likely lower .",
    "this is due to the @xmath75 gyr timescale necessary for the stellar companion to come into roche lobe contact with its bh companion ( and thus turn on the lmxb ) , either by stellar evolution or via orbital decay @xcite .    using @xmath70 as our estimate",
    ", this would imply only @xmath76 x - ray detections from lmxbs in a sample of 64 late - type spirals ( assuming 75% have ncs with mean properties ) , of which m33 is a typical example .",
    "this is a factor of 34 lower than our observed detection rate .",
    "the observed x - ray luminosities in our sample are similar to the known agns , making our other detections reasonable agn candidates .",
    "this implies that ncs and bhs need not be necessarily mutually exclusive , if the majority of our agn candidates are true agns .",
    "indeed , @xcite find that over all hubble types , roughly 10% of all galaxies hosting a nc also host an agn , based on optical spectroscopy , with a fraction that increases strongly with galaxy and nc mass .",
    "it is important to note that these detections are agn _ candidates _ , and are worthy of further detailed observations to properly identify these sources . @xcite",
    "provide some evidence from a multiwavelength analysis that ngc3184 , ngc4713 , and ngc5457 are true agns .",
    "since most of our candidates have very few counts , long - integration x - ray spectroscopy will be useful in differentiating true agns from lmxbs , particularly at very soft and hard energies . as described above",
    ", agns have x - ray spectra composed of an absorbed power law ( with @xmath77 ) , whereas x - ray binaries have spectra that can be separated into three states : a high / soft state with a @xmath71 kev thermal component and a weak nonthermal tail at high ( @xmath2 10 kev ) energies ; a very high state with a steep power law ( @xmath78 ) combined with a @xmath71 kev thermal blackbody , which can constitute a significant amount of the total flux ; and a low / hard state with a single power law ( @xmath79 ) @xcite .",
    "of these three states , only the low / hard state could be confused with an agn , but x - ray binaries in these states typically have extraordinarily low luminosities ( @xmath80  @xmath81 ergs s@xmath6 ) , which would distinguish them from true agns .",
    "our spectral fits ( table  [ tab : spectra ] and figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) are insufficient to definitively rule out one model over another , though they remain very suggestive .",
    "for ngc4039 , a pure thermal blackbody is likely ruled out , whereas an absorbed power law is plausible , and an absorbed power law + blackbody model ( indicative of a very high state lmxb ) is consistent with the data .",
    "given that the reduced @xmath82 of the latter model is @xmath831 , however , we may be overfitting the data , and so we must be cautious . although it may appear as though this is more likely an x - ray binary ( of extremely high luminosity @xmath84 ergs s@xmath6 ) , longer - integration data are needed to distinguish between the two models .",
    "ngc4490 and ngc6946 are both well fit by simple absorbed power law models ( @xmath85 ) , consistent with the agn interpretation . in the case of ngc4490 ,",
    "the unabsorbed blackbody model results in a poorer fit , particularly at low energies , while for ngc6946 , both models are consistent with the data .",
    "unfortunately , the data are not of high enough quality to differentiate between models with more parameters , such as an absorbed power law + blackbody , since @xmath86 in all cases . once again",
    ", these results underscore the need for higher s / n data if we are to use a @xmath82 statistic to differentiate between various models .. as a check , we also analyzed ngc4395 , a known seyfert 1 , which is unsurprisingly well fit by an absorbed power law , whose parameters are consistent with those given by @xcite .    in figure  [",
    "fig : colors ] we show the x - ray colors of those agn candidates with sufficient counts .",
    "we also include various absorbed power - law models and a 1 kev blackbody ( representative of the high / soft state from @xcite ) , computed for observations with acis - s using xspec .",
    "all agn candidates are consistent with absorbed power - law models , and inconsistent with the 1 kev blackbody .",
    "although the uncertainties are large , it appears as though most of these candidates exhibit softer x - ray spectra than is typically assumed for low - luminosity agns .",
    "low - mass agns can exhibit a range of x - ray spectra , however , with @xmath87 1.0 to 3.0 @xcite .",
    "clearly , detailed x - ray spectroscopy is needed to further characterize these systems .    once agns are positively identified , determining a bh mass estimate will be challenging .",
    "dynamical measurements are currently not feasible in these objects .",
    "reverberation mapping @xcite or virial estimates @xcite based on the strength of optical emission lines ( if detected ) will likely require excellent seeing conditions with a narrow slit or adaptive optics . as these are all nearly bulgeless systems , using the bulge velocity dispersion @xmath42 or the bulge luminosity @xmath88 @xcite to determine @xmath89 is challenging and highly uncertain .",
    "ncs with bhs , however , fall on the @xmath8 relation  for example ngc4395 @xcite and g1 @xcite  consistent with the extrapolation of @xmath8 to lower masses @xcite .",
    "the velocity dispersions of ncs @xcite could therefore be used to estimate the bh mass .",
    "bh masses can also be estimated from x - ray variability timescales derived from complete power density spectra ( @xcite ) , obtained over long monitoring campaigns .",
    "alternatively , the bh mass can be estimated from the excess variance measured in shorter x - ray data sets @xcite .",
    "our detection rate suggests an agn fraction in late - type spiral galaxies of @xmath720%25% ( depending on the lmxb contamination ) , higher than that observed by @xcite .",
    "( we should caution , however , that several detections are at low s / n . using only s / n@xmath23 detections",
    ", our agn fraction becomes @xmath717% . )",
    "this would imply that we are indeed missing many low - mass agns in optical surveys , and that bhs in such systems are more prevalent than previously suggested .",
    "optical surveys of low - mass agns can only find systems with high accretion rates , such that their bolometric luminosity @xmath90 approaches a substantial fraction of the eddington luminosity @xmath91 ergs s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a median @xmath92 and a minimum @xmath93 in a sample of 174 optically selected low - mass agns .",
    "in a pilot study drawn from this sample , @xcite measured @xmath3(0.52 kev ) @xmath94@xmath95 ergs s@xmath6 , much higher than any of our measurements .",
    "most of our candidates with available @xmath89 estimates exhibit @xmath96 ratios orders of magnitude lower than those of @xcite , assuming a correction factor of 16 to convert from @xmath3 to @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "the one exception is ngc4395 , a known seyfert nucleus , with @xmath97 , consistent with the value of @xmath98 to @xmath99 found by @xcite .",
    "( in comparison , pox52 has @xmath100 ; @xcite . )",
    "our estimated eddington ratios are similar , however , to those seen in massive bhs in earlier - type hosts with low - luminosity agns @xcite , suggesting that we are detecting the low - mass analogs of weakly accreting bhs .",
    "x - ray surveys therefore allow us to probe much fainter down the luminosity function of low - mass agns , detecting weakly accreting systems that would be completely swamped by galactic emission at optical wavelengths , and obtain a much higher detection rate .",
    "the @xcite sample , for instance , identified only 174 low - mass agns out of 8435 optically identified agns ( from a parent sample of @xmath7600,000 galaxies ) .    given the low estimated accretion rates of our agn candidates , radio observations can help to clarify the nature of these x - ray sources . if these are indeed low - mass and low - accretion - rate systems , we should expect them to have a radio signature , much like the more massive low - luminosity bhs @xcite .",
    "extrapolating from higher masses , we would expect 2 cm radio fluxes of order 10 to 100 @xmath101jy @xcite .",
    "if these x - ray sources are x - ray binaries instead , however , they would be accreting at eddington or super - eddington rates to achieve such high luminosities .",
    "x - ray binaries in such states do no have a radio counterpart @xcite .",
    "@xcite have conducted a similar survey of agns in the infrared , searching for emission - line signatures of agn activity ( in particular ,  emission ; see @xcite ) in late - type galaxies that are optically quiescent .",
    "this should identify weakly accreting systems similar to our candidates . in a sample of 32 objects , nine",
    "of which overlap with our _ chandra _ sample , they find seven agn candidates , a similar detection fraction .",
    "interestingly , of the nine overlap objects , six ( ic342 , ngc925 , ngc3184 , ngc4490 , ngc4559 , and ngc6946 ) are identified in this paper as agn candidates , but not by @xcite it is possible that the weakly active nuclei picked out by our x - ray search method are too faint to emit much  emission .",
    "we can estimate the total  luminosity @xmath102 for our sample assuming the bolometric luminosity @xmath103 and @xmath104 @xcite , where @xmath105 is the continuum luminosity at 5100  , coupled with the correlation between @xmath105 and @xmath102 found by @xcite . for our range in x - ray luminosities ( @xmath47  @xmath48 ergs s@xmath6 ) , this corresponds to  luminosities of @xmath106  @xmath107 ergs s@xmath6 .",
    "these luminosities are orders of magnitude fainter than those measured by @xcite .",
    "even ngc3184 , which appears to be a _ bona fide _",
    "agn @xcite , was not detected .",
    "the @xcite detections of  are in excess of the @xcite relation , however , thus it is possible these relations do not hold for very late - type spiral galaxies .",
    "another factor that might be relevant is the ionization parameter ; since  is a high - ionization line , its strength decreases dramatically when the ionization parameter decreases @xcite . by analogy with the local population of liners and seyferts @xcite , the very low eddington ratios of our low - mass systems should correspond to low ionization parameters , and thus plausibly weak  emission .",
    "finally , we note that ngc3556 is identified by @xcite as an agn candidate but has no x - ray detection in this work . @xcite",
    "identify an x - ray source as a candidate for the galactic nucleus in ngc3556 ( which they number source 35 ) ; we chose not to include this source in our candidate list as the offset from the optical nucleus is 10 .",
    "more detailed study is clearly warranted , and it will likely take the combined efforts of large multiwavelength surveys to find such low - mass and low - luminosity agns , and to properly assess the global agn fraction in these late - type systems .",
