    "surface acoustic waves ( saw s ) @xcite provide a useful tool for experimental studies of the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in gaas / algaas - heterostructures .",
    "in particular , saw s have been used in recent years in investigations of the integer @xcite and the fractional @xcite quantum hall regimes . due to the quantum hall effect",
    ", the interaction of the saw with the charge carriers can lead to strong oscillations in the attenuation and the velocity of the sound waves as function of the applied magnetic field .",
    "quantum oscillations have also been reported for the sound - induced currents and voltages @xcite .",
    "previous theoretical descriptions of these experiments have been based essentially on classical models for the propagation of saw s @xcite . according to these models , which are originally derived for systems in the absence of an applied magnetic field",
    ", the sound attenuation is expressed in terms of the electrical dc conductivity .",
    "this relation is derived under the assumptions that @xmath12 and ( ` local regime ' ) , where and @xmath6 are the wave vector and the frequency of the sound , respectively , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the mean free path and the scattering time of the conduction electrons , respectively .",
    "if a ( classical ) magnetic field is applied , the first condition has to be replaced by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the cyclotron radius@xcite .",
    "it is much more difficult , however , to determine under which conditions the above mentioned theories are valid when the 2deg is subject to a quantizing magnetic field . in this case , the electron system is characterized by ( at least ) two more length scales , namely the magnetic length @xmath17 and the localization length @xcite @xmath18 . while @xmath19 is always fulfilled under typical experimental conditions , the localization length can be much larger than the surface acoustic wavelength @xmath2 .",
    "a series of experiments @xcite has shown a reasonable agreement with the predictions of the classical models in a wide range of frequencies @xmath6 and magnetic field strengths . on the other hand , some deviations have also been detected .",
    "for example , deviations of the saw attenuation from the classically predicted behavior with increasing frequency have been reported@xcite .",
    "these were attributed to nonlocal effects of the interaction between the saw and the 2deg which should occur when the sound wavelength becomes of the order of or smaller than a characteristic length scale of the electron gas . in the fractional quantum hall regime ,",
    "an anomaly in the absorption coefficient for filling factor @xmath20 was found @xcite .",
    "this anomaly was discussed in the framework of the composite fermion model of ref .  .",
    "according to this approach , the electrons are replaced by composite fermions moving in an effective magnetic field of zero average ( at @xmath20 ) .",
    "then , the sound absorption due to these particles is described by classical formulae except that the dc conductivity is replaced by the wave vector dependent nonlocal conductivity which , however , represents a very important difference ( see ref .   for details ) .    in this paper",
    "we study the propagation of saw s in the integer quantum hall regime .",
    "the calculation of the saw attenuation is carried out for filling factors near 1/2 and is based on a percolation approach to the electronic states in a very strong magnetic field . from this point of view",
    "we may anticipate a nonlocal behavior of the attenuation arising from the large characteristic length scales ( e.  g. , the size of a percolation cluster @xmath21 ) inherent in that framework .",
    "the effect of electron - electron interaction is taken into account by the screening of the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the same problem has also been studied in ref .  .",
    "these authors calculated the nonlocal conductivity due to variable - range hopping between pairs of localized states .",
    "then , in the spirit of the classical description of sound absorption , this conductivity is related to the saw attenuation coefficient . a comparison with our results will be given in sec .",
    "the system considered is a 2deg , subject to a very strong magnetic field @xmath22 and a smooth random potential @xmath23 .",
    "the potential can be characterized by its amplitude @xmath1 and its correlation length @xmath0 .",
    "the amplitude also determines the width of the landau levels .",
    "the correlation length is of the order of the spacer layer that separates the 2deg from the dopant layers . under the assumption that @xmath24 a quasiclassical description of the electron states can be applied .",
    "that is , one considers the drift motion of the guiding center of an electron on the equipotential lines ( el s ) of @xmath23 separately from the rapid motion relative to it @xcite .",
    "the drift velocity is given by @xmath25 .",
    "using @xmath26 , the drift velocity can be estimated to be @xmath27 .",
    "depending on the ratio between the correlation length @xmath0 and the sound wavelength , two regimes can be distinguished .",
    "for @xmath28 , the electron - phonon interaction can be considered locally neglecting the global structure of the el s @xcite .",
    "[ for single - phonon absorption and emission processes to occur , one has also to require that the sound velocity @xmath29 is smaller than the drift velocity .",
    "this is usually referred to as @xmath30erenkov condition@xcite .",
    "] this regime is valid for , e.  g. , thermal phonons@xcite .",
    "however , saw s have a much larger wavelength , and hence @xmath31 is typically fulfilled . in this case , the local absorption and emission of phonons is exponentially small , and the el as a whole has to be considered .",
    "it becomes important that the motion of the guiding center on an extended el [ with a length @xmath32 resembles a random walk , with a diffusion coefficient @xmath33 . since the ratio @xmath34 , for real systems , is not very different from unity , one deals with the limit @xmath35 of this diffusion process .",
    "[ to be precise@xcite , the parameter @xmath34 has to lie in the range @xmath36 .",
    "] indeed , for @xmath37 t ( @xmath38 nm ) , @xmath39mev , @xmath40 nm , @xmath41@xmath42 , and @xmath43cms@xmath44 we find @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "it is this particular ( diffusive ) regime which will be addressed in this paper . in the same regime , the electron life - time and the energy relaxation time due to interaction with 3d bulk phonons have been calculated in ref .  .",
    "the quantum mechanical calculation of the attenuation coefficient ( as well as of other quantities associated with saw s ) requires the knowledge of the hamiltonians which describe the interaction of electrons with acoustic surface phonons .",
    "as far as we know these interaction hamiltonians have not yet been derived . instead",
    ", many theoretical investigations have addressed the interaction of 2d electrons with 3d ( bulk ) or 2d phonon systems .",
    "the latter one , a single layer of vibrating atoms , represents merely a theoretical construction .",
    "three - dimensional phonons do not provide an appropriate approach when the 2deg is located near a free crystal surface @xcite .",
    "this implies that it is by no means clear that the interaction of a saw with the 2deg is described well by the formulae which are valid in the case of bulk phonons .",
    "in fact , we find that the interaction vertices appearing in the general electron - phonon interaction hamiltonian [ see eq .",
    "( [ hdefdet ] ) ] differ from those for 3d phonons not only by numerical constants but also in the phonon wave vector dependence and the relative phase between the deformation potential and the piezoelectric interactions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the interaction vertices are derived and discussed in the next section . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe the quasiclassical electron states of a 2deg in a strong magnetic field and a random potential @xmath23 .",
    "we show that the absorption of the saw and the dielectric function depend crucially on the occupation and the properties of electron states which correspond to very long el s .",
    "the structure of these el s is deduced from the 2d percolation theory .",
    "the matrix elements for transitions between different electron states are given in sec .",
    "the screening of the electron - phonon interaction due to the 2deg is accounted for by a dielectric function @xmath47 which is calculated in sec .",
    "v. based on these results , the saw attenuation coefficient is obtained in sec .",
    "its dependence on the filling factor ( or the fermi energy ) , the saw frequency and the temperature are discussed .",
    "a short summary is given in sec .",
    "to simplify the calculations we use the following assumptions .",
    "since the saw wavelength @xmath48 is much longer than the lattice constant , the crystal can be approximated by a continuous medium .",
    "its elastic properties are assumed to be isotropic .",
    "furthermore , we disregard the fact that the gaas - substrate is coated with layers which differ slightly in their elastic properties .",
    "the overall thickness of these layers @xcite @xmath49 nm is much smaller than the wavelength of sound .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that for @xmath50 the deviations of the wave propagation resulting from a thin overlayer coating an homogeneous substrate can be accounted for by a systematic expansion in this small parameter . in our case @xmath51 , i.  e. ,",
    "these corrections are indeed negligible .",
    "thus , we end up with the standard problem of sound waves which are propagated in an isotropic medium bounded by a plane @xcite .",
    "( effects resulting from the anisotropy of the lattice become important for @xmath52 , see ref .  . )",
    "let the surface be in the @xmath53-@xmath54-plane and the medium in the half space @xmath55 .",
    "the longitudinal and transversal components of the displacement field @xmath56 , @xmath57 , obey the wave equations @xmath58where @xmath59 are the corresponding sound velocities . by definition , curl@xmath60 and div@xmath61 .",
    "surface waves are composed of particular solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ waveeq ] ) that decay exponentially with increasing distance from the surface . in addition , these solutions have to satisfy the boundary conditions at the free surface @xmath62 , namely , the normal components of the stress tensor should vanish there .",
    "it turns out that these boundary conditions can only be fulfilled by a linear combination of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , i.  e. , pure longitudinal or transversal surface waves do not exist @xcite . the full displacement field for a mode with a two - dimensional wave vector can be written as    [ uq ] @xmath65with @xmath66    that is , the displacement @xmath67 is polarized in the sagittal plane which is spanned by the propagation direction @xmath68 and the surface normal @xmath69 . the decay of the displacements into the interior of the medium is described by @xmath70where @xmath71 and @xmath18 is a root of an algebraic equation of sixth order containing the parameter @xmath72 only ( see p.  104 in ref .  ) .",
    "@xmath18 enters the dispersion relation of the surface waves in the form @xmath73 where @xmath29 is the saw velocity .",
    "finally , the factor @xmath74 is given by    @xmath75    in order to quantize the displacement field ( [ uq ] ) , the normalization constant @xmath76 of each individual mode has first to be fixed in an appropriate way .",
    "that is , the energy associated with the mode @xmath77 in the normalization volume has to coincide with the energy @xmath78 of the corresponding phonon .",
    "since the wave is propagated freely along the surface , the energy is normalized with respect to a large but finite square of area @xmath79 in the @xmath53-@xmath54-plane . on the contrary ,",
    "no such restriction is necessary with respect to the @xmath80-coordinate because @xmath67 decays exponentially with increasing distance from the surface .",
    "thus , the normalization volume can be extended from @xmath62 to @xmath81 under the chosen surface area .    adding a kinetic energy term to the potential energy @xcite associated with a displacement field @xmath82 , the total energy can be written as @xmath83 , \\]]where @xmath84 is the mass density of the medium and @xmath85is the strain tensor .",
    "inserting @xmath67 , eq .",
    "( [ uq ] ) , into this formula and imposing the condition @xmath86 determines the normalization as    [ norm ] @xmath87 with a numerical factor @xmath88   \\ , .",

    "the hamiltonian of the deformation potential can be written as @xmath96the spread of the transversal component of the electron wave function as well as the distance @xmath97 of the 2deg from the surface are small compared to @xmath98 .",
    "thus , in evaluating eq .",
    "( [ hdefgen ] ) , one can set all exponentials in @xmath99 , eq .",
    "( [ uq2 ] ) , equal to 1 .",
    "conveniently , the electron - phonon interaction hamiltonian can be written in the general form @xmath100for a deformation potential interaction we derive from eqs .",
    "( [ uqcomplete ] ) and ( [ hdefgen ] ) the interaction vertex @xmath101following a notation introduced in ref .",

    "this gives @xmath103where @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "@xmath106 is the frequency of longitudinal optical phonons and @xmath107 is the effective mass of the electrons .",
    "along with the deformation potential interaction , the piezoelectric electron - phonon interaction appears in crystals which lack a center of symmetry , cf .",
    "for example ref .  .",
    "in this case , an elastic wave leads to a polarization of the lattice , @xmath108where @xmath109 is the tensor of the piezoelectric moduli .",
    "the corresponding interaction hamiltonian follows from the electric potential @xmath110 associated with the polarization and reads @xmath111the polarization and the electric potential are related to one another via poisson s equation @xmath112where @xmath113 is the dielectric displacement and @xmath114 is the dielectric constant of gaas .    in the case of interest here ,",
    "the general expression ( [ pj ] ) is simplified because the gaas - samples used in experiments are cubic crystals and a crystal cut is chosen [ the ( 100 ) surface ] where the surface is spanned by two lattice axes @xcite .",

    "this applies to both the deformation potential and the piezoelectric interaction .",
    "consequently , the use of the saw interaction vertices in calculations of various physical quantities can give rise to results which deviate from those which are based on the assumption of two- or three - dimensional phonon systems .",
    "second , for surface phonons , the deformation potential and the piezoelectric interaction are _ in _ phase .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of bulk phonons where these vertices are _ out _ of phase , i.  e.  they contribute additively to latexmath:[$|\\gamma_{bulk}|^2=     ref .  .",
    "the absolute value squared of @xmath144 is the relevant quantity which determines the total electron - phonon interaction .",
    "clearly , the ` out of phase ' or the ` in phase ' property is of importance only when the interaction vertices for the deformation potential and the piezoelectric interaction are of the same order of magnitude .",

    "thus , for the range of wavelengths used in recent experiments on the attenuation of a saw in gaas - samples ( see , for example , refs .   and ) , the deformation potential scattering can be neglected in comparison with the piezoelectric interaction , except for propagation along @xmath151 directions .",
