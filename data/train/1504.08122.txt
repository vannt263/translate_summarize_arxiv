    "the case of dense graphs was developed in the series of papers by borgs , chayes , lovsz , ss , szegedy and vesztergombi  @xcite and is considered to be well - understood . in the case of sparse graphs ( such as those with bounded maximum degree ) , the most used notion of convergence known as the benjamini - schramm convergence , which was studied e.g.  in  @xcite , comes with substantial disadvantages .",
    "several alternative notions were proposed  @xcite , however , each of them also comes with certain drawbacks .    as an attempt to unify the existing notions of convergence for dense and sparse graphs , neetil and ossona de mendez",
    "@xcite proposed a notion of convergence based on first order properties of graphs , the _ first order convergence _ ( a formal definition is given in section  [ sect - fo ] ) .",
    "this notion applies to all relational structures , and it implies the standard notion of convergence in the case of dense graphs and the benjamini - schramm convergence in the case of sparse graphs .",
    "a first order convergent sequence of graphs can be associated with an analytic representation , known as a _ limit modeling_. unfortunately , not all first order convergent sequences of graphs do have a limit modeling  @xcite , e.g. , the sequence of erds - rnyi random graphs is first order convergent with probability one but it has no limit modeling .",
    "the existence of a limit modeling of a first order convergent sequence is one of central problems related to first order convergence .",
    "neetil and ossona de mendez  @xcite conjectured that every first order convergent sequence of sparse graphs has a limit modeling :    [ conj ] let @xmath0 be a nowhere - dense class of graphs .",
    "every first order convergent sequence of graphs from @xmath0 has a limit modeling .",
    "recall that nowhere - dense classes of graphs are classes of graphs  @xcite which include all minor closed classes of graphs ( in particular , trees , planar graphs , etc . ) and some more general classes of sparse graphs .",
    "however , only little is known towards proving conjecture  [ conj ] .",
    "neetil and ossona de mendez  @xcite showed that every first order convergent sequence of trees of bounded depth has a limit modeling , and they used this result to show that every first order convergent sequence of graphs with bounded tree - depth has a limit modeling .",
    "three of the authors ( dk , mk and vt ) extended this result and showed that every first order convergent sequence of trees has a limit modeling .",
    "this is also implied by a more general result of neetil and ossona de mendez  @xcite , who developed a framework for building limit modelings based on residual and non - dispersive first order convergent sequences .    in this paper",
    ", we make another step towards a proof of conjecture  [ conj ] .",
    "we show that every first order convergent sequence of trees embedded in the plane has a limit modeling ( theorem  [ thm - plane ] ) and that every first order convergent sequence of graphs with bounded path - width has a limit modeling ( theorem  [ thm - pw ] ) . while the first result can be viewed as a small extension of the result on the existence of limit modelings of first order convergent sequences of trees , it turned out that embedding the trees in the plane , which essentially corresponds to fixing the cyclic order among the neighbors of each vertex , gave us enough power to prove the ( more important ) result on the existence of limit modelings of first order convergent sequences of graphs with bounded path - width .",
    "note that the class of graphs of bounded path - width is significantly richer than the class of trees , which do not have cycles at all , or the classes of graphs with bounded tree - depth , which do not have long paths . in a certain sense",
    ", this is the first class of graphs with rich internal structure for which conjecture  [ conj ] is proven .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm - plane ] on the existence of limit modelings of first order convergent sequences of plane trees consists of two steps : a decomposition step described in section  [ sect - decompose ] and a composition step described in section  [ sect - compose ]",
    ". the decomposition step aims at analyzing first order properties of the graphs in the sequence and describing them through quantities that we refer to as stone measure and discrete stone measure .",
    "the composition step then uses these quantities to build a limit modeling of the sequence .",
    "the decomposition step follows the line of our original proof of the existence of limit modelings of first order convergent sequences of trees .",
    "however , we decided to replace the composition step of our original proof with the arguments from the analogous part of the proof given in  @xcite , which we have found elegant and simpler than the composition step of our original proof using methods from  @xcite .",
    "we then employ first order interpretation schemes to encode graphs with bounded path - width by plane trees , which allows us to prove our result on first order convergent sequences of graphs with bounded path - width ( theorem  [ thm - pw ] ) .",
    "we also note that the modelings constructed in theorems  [ thm - plane ] and  [ thm - pw ] satisfy the strong finitary mass transport principle , which , vaguely speaking , forbids the existence of a small and a large subset of vertices with a matching between them .",
    "we mostly follow the standard graph theory terminology and the standard model theory terminology as it can be found e.g.  in  @xcite and in  @xcite , respectively . still , we want to specify some less standard notation and to introduce some non - standard notation related to graphs with bounded path - width . in",

    "the signature we use to describe plane trees consists of two binary relational symbols @xmath60 and @xmath61 : the relation @xmath60 describes the child - parent relation and the relation @xmath61 determines a linear order among the children of nodes . more precisely , if @xmath62 is a plane tree , then @xmath63 if @xmath8 is a child of @xmath64 .",

    "since plane trees are rooted , we can speak about subtrees of their nodes , i.e.  the _ subtree _ of a node @xmath24 of a plane tree is the subtree induced by all descendants of @xmath24 .    the main result of this section is the following theorem .    [ thm - plane ]",
    "every first - order convergent sequence of plane trees has a limit modeling satisfying the strong finitary mass transport principle .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the proof of theorem  [ thm - plane ] has two parts .",
    "first , we represent a first order convergent sequence of plane trees through a measure on hintikka chains .",

    "* theorems 2729 ) and for general trees in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 36 ) .",
    "however , we do not use comb structure to capture first order properties of plane trees and we employ another technique , bringing a different view on constructing limits of first order convergent sequences .",
    "we believe that our decomposition technique involves fewer tools from analysis and model theory and is more of combinatorial nature , which might be useful when extending the results to wider classes of graphs .",
    "on the other hand , the composition step developed by some of the authors when constructing modelings of first order convergent sequences of trees was more technical and less elegant than the one used in  @xcite .",
    "so , we adapt ideas from the proof of lemma 39 in  @xcite to prove lemma  [ lm - composition ] ; however , it is not possible to use lemma 39 from  @xcite in our setting directly since it concerns trees / forests only and it is designed to be used in conjunction with comb structure results presented in  @xcite .      our first aim is to identify nodes that are in the proximity of a non - zero fraction of other nodes .",
    "a node @xmath24 of a tree @xmath62 is _ @xmath66-major _ if the sum of the sizes of the two largest components of @xmath67 is at most @xmath68 .",

    "we will color some nodes in the @xmath69-neighborhood of @xmath19 as green .",

    "next , we recolor all green nodes that are @xmath66-major to red",
    ". we will refer to the nodes that are not red or green as black nodes .",
