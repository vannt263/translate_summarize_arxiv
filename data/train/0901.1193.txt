    "the accelerated expansion of the universe , which is today observed , shows that cosmological dynamic is dominated by the so called dark energy which gives a large negative pressure .",
    "this is the standard picture , in which such new ingredient is considered as a source of the _ right hand side _ of the well known friedman - robertson - walker field equations @xcite .",
    "it should be some form of non - clustered and non - zero vacuum energy which , together with the clustered dark matter , drives the global dynamics .",
    "this is the so called `` concordance model '' ( lambda cold dark matter , @xmath0cdm ) which gives , in agreement with the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) , large structure scale ( lss ) and supernovae ia ( sneia ) data , a good framework of the today observed universe , but presents several shortcomings as the well known `` coincidence '' and `` cosmological constant '' problems @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is changing the _ left hand side _ of the field equations , seeing if observed cosmic dynamics can be achieved extending general relativity @xcite . in this different context , it is not required to find out candidates for dark energy and dark matter , that , till now , have not been found , but only the `` observed '' ingredients , which are curvature and baryon matter , have to be taken into account .",
    "considering this point of view , one can think that gravity is not scale - invariant and a room for alternative theories is present @xcite .    in this picture ,",
    "even the sensitive detectors for gravitational waves , like bars and interferometers ( i.e. those which are currently in operation and the ones which are in a phase of planning and proposal stages ) @xcite , could , in principle , be important to confirm or to rule out the physical consistency of general relativity or of any other theory of gravitation .",
    "this is because , in the context of extended theories of gravity , some differences between general relativity and the others theories can be pointed out starting from the linearized theory of gravity @xcite .    in principle , the most popular dark energy and dark matter models can be achieved considering @xmath1 theories of gravity @xcite , where @xmath2 is the ricci curvature scalar . in the tapestry of extended theories of gravity , it is quite important to understand why we are going to select @xmath1 theories of gravity among several existing modified theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "the motivation on such a choice have been recently well emphasized in the interesting analysis in @xcite .",
    "thus , following the review @xcite , we recall that some @xmath1 theories of gravity are not excluded by requirements of cosmology and solar system tests , i.e are",
    "_ viable_. on the same time , they have quite rich cosmological structure : they may naturally describe the effective ( cosmological constant , quintessence or phantom ) late - time era with a possible transition from deceleration to acceleration thanks to gravitational terms which increase with scalar curvature decrease .",
    "in other words , @xmath1 theories are well tuned with an accelerating standard frw universe .",
    "these theories may be also rewritten as scalar - tensor gravity ( einstein frame ) with the aid of conform transformations .",
    "starting by these considerations , in @xcite two specific viable models have been considered : the one with @xmath3 and @xmath4 terms , and another with @xmath5 terms .",
    "it has been shown that both of the models may lead to the ( cosmological constant or quintessence ) acceleration of the universe as well as an early time inflation . moreover",
    ", the first model seems to pass the solar system tests , i.e. it has the acceptable newtonian limit , no instabilities and no brans - dicke problem ( decoupling of scalar ) in scalar - tensor version @xcite .",
    "these versions of @xmath1 theories may also describe cosmic speed - up at late universe .",
    "@xmath1 theories can be taken into account also in the analysis of the sbgws which , together with the cmbr , would carry , if detected , a huge amount of information on the early stages of the universe evolution @xcite ) . a key role for the production and the detection of this graviton background is played by the adopted theory of gravity @xcite in this case too .    in the second section of this review ,",
    "the sbgws is analysed with the aid of the wmap data @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that , in general , in previous works in the literature about the sbgws , old cobe data were used ( see @xcite for example ) .    in the third section",
    "we want to face the problem of how the sbgws and @xmath1 gravity can be related , showing , vice versa , that a revealed sbgws could be a powerful probe for a given theory of gravity . in this way",
    ", it will also be shown that the conform treatment of sbgws can be used to parametrize in a natural way f(r ) theories . in this framework",
    ", we will discuss like particular case @xcite some interesting viable @xmath1 theories that have been analysed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this way ,",
    "a discussion which started in @xcite will be integrated .",
    "the presence and the potential detection of the sbgws is quite important in the framework of the debate on high - frequency gravitational waves ( hfgws ) too .",
    "recently , the importance of hfgws has been emphasized in some papers in the literature @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that this is a review of previous works on the sbgws which have been discussed in various peer - reviewed journals and international conferences .",
    "from our analysis , it will result that the wmap bounds on the energy spectrum and on the characteristic amplitude of the sbgws are greater than the cobe ones , but they are also far below frequencies of the earth - based antennas band . at the end of this section",
    "a lower bound for the integration time of a potential detection with advanced ligo is released and compared with the previous one arising from the old cobe data .",
    "even if the new lower bound is minor than the previous one , it results very long , thus for a possible detection we hope in the laser interferometric space antenna ( lisa ) and in a further growth in the sensitivity of advanced projects .    the strongest constraint on the spectrum of the relic sbgws in the frequency range of ground based antennas like bars and interferometers , which is the range @xmath6 , comes from the high isotropy observed in the cmbr .",
    "the fluctuation @xmath7 of the temperature of cmbr from its mean value @xmath8 k varies from point to point in the sky @xcite , and , since the sky can be considered the surface of a sphere , the fitting of @xmath7 is performed in terms of a laplace series of spherical harmonics    @xmath9    and the fluctuations are assumed statistically independent ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "@xmath12 denotes a point on the 2-sphere in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluttuazioni cbr ] ) , while the @xmath13 are the multipole moments of the cmbr . for details about the definition of statistically independent fluctuations in the context of the temperature fluctuations of cmbr see @xcite .",
    "the wmap data @xcite permit a more precise determination of the rms quadrupole moment of the fluctuations than the cobe data    @xmath14    while in the cobe data we had @xcite    @xmath15    a connection between the fluctuation of the temperature of the cmbr and the sbgws derives from the _ sachs - wolfe effect _ @xcite .",
    "sachs and wolfe showed that variations in the density of cosmological fluid and gws perturbations result in the fluctuation of the temperature of the cmbr , even if the surface of last scattering had a perfectly uniform temperature @xcite .",
    "in particular , the fluctuation of the temperature ( at the lowest order ) in a particular point of the space is    @xmath16    the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : null geodesic ] ) is taken over a path of null geodesic which leaves the current spacetime point heading off in the direction defined by the unit vector @xmath12 and going back to the surface of last scattering of the cmbr .",
    "here @xmath17 is a particular choice of the affine parameter along the null geodesic . by using conform coordinates , we have for the metric perturbation    @xmath18    and @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : null geodesic ] ) is a radial spatial coordinate which goes outwards from the current spacetime point .",
    "the effect of a long wavelength gw is to shift the temperature distribution of cmbr from perfect isotropy . as the fluctuations are very small ( @xmath20 @xcite ) , the perturbations caused by the relic sbgws can not be too large .",
    "the wmap results give rather tight constraints on the spectrum of the sbgws at very long wavelengths .",
    "in @xcite we find a constraint on @xmath21 which derives from the cobe observational limits , given by    @xmath22    we included a dimensionless factor @xmath23 which now is just a convenience ( in the past it came from an uncertainty in the value of @xmath24 ) . from the wmap data we have @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "now , the same constraint will be obtained from the wmap data @xcite . because of its specific polarization properties , relic sbgws should generate particular polarization patterns of cmbr anisotropies , but the detection of cmbr polarizations is not fulfilled today @xcite .",
    "thus , an indirect method will be used .",
    "we know that relic gws have very long wavelengths of hubble radius size , then the cmbr power spectrum from them should manifest fast decrease at smaller scales ( high multipole moments ) .",
    "but we also know that scalar modes produce a rich cmbr power spectrum at large multipole moments ( series of acoustic peaks , @xcite ) . then , the properties of tensor modes in the cosmological perturbations of spacetime metric can be extract from observational data using angular cmbr power spectrum combined with large scale structure of the universe .",
    "one can see ( fig .",
    "1 ) that in the range @xmath26 ( the same used in @xcite , but with the old cobe data @xcite ) scalar and tensor contributions are comparable .        * figure 1 : the tensor to scalar ratio , adapted from c. corda * * mod",
    "a 22 , 16 , 1167 - 1173 ( 2007 ) *    from @xcite , the wmap data give for the tensor / scalar ratio @xmath19 the constraint @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 @xcite obtained @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "thus , if one remembers that , at order of hubble radius , the tensor spectral index is @xmath30 @xcite , it results    @xmath31    which is greater than the cobe data result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : limite cobe ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that the limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : limite wmap ] ) is not a limit for any gws , but only for relic ones of cosmological origin , which were present at the era of the cmbr decoupling .",
    "also , the same limit only applies over very long wavelengths ( i.e. very low frequencies ) and it is far below frequencies of the virgo - ligo ( laser interferometric gravitational observatory ) band .",
    "the primordial production of the relic sbgws has been analysed in @xcite ( note : a generalization for f(r ) theories of gravity will be given in the next section following @xcite ) , where it has been shown that in the range @xmath32 the spectrum is flat and proportional to the ratio    @xmath33    as the spectrum remains flat at high frequency , the relic sbgws are quite important also in the framework of hfgws , which have been emphasized in some works in the recent literature @xcite .",
    "wmap observations put strongly severe restrictions on the spectrum , as we discussed above . in fig .",
    "2 the spectrum @xmath34 is mapped : the amplitude ( determined by the ratio @xmath35 ) has been chosen to be _ as large as possible , consistent with the wmap constraint _ ( [ eq : limite wmap ] ) .",

    ", 30 , 209 - 215 ( 2008 ) *    nevertheless , because the spectrum falls off @xmath36 at low frequencies @xcite , this means that today , at virgo and lisa frequencies , indicated in fig .",
    "2 ,    @xmath37    while using the cobe data it was    @xmath38(refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to calculate the correspondent strain at @xmath39 , where interferometers like virgo and ligo have a maximum in sensitivity .",
    "the well known equation for the characteristic amplitude @xcite can be used :    @xmath40    obtaining    @xmath41    then , as for ground - based interferometers a sensitivity of the order of @xmath42 is expected at @xmath39 , four order of magnitude have to be gained in the signal to noise ratio @xcite .",
    "let us analyze smaller frequencies too .",
    "the sensitivity of the virgo interferometer is of the order of @xmath43 at @xmath44 @xcite and in that case it is    @xmath45    for a better understanding of the difficulties on the detection of the sbgws , a lower bound for the integration time of a potential detection with advanced ligo is released . for a cross - correlation between two interferometers the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) increases as    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the one - sided power spectral density of the @xmath48 detector @xcite and @xmath49 the well known overlap - reduction function @xcite . assuming two coincident co - aligned detectors @xmath50 with a noise of order @xmath51 ( i.e. a typical value for the advanced ligo sensitivity @xcite ) , one gets @xmath52 for @xmath53 using our result @xmath54 while it is @xmath52 for @xmath55 using previous cobe result @xmath56 . as the overlap reduction function degrades the snr , these results can be considered a solid upper limit for the advanced ligo configuration for the two different values of the spectrum .",
    "the sensitivity of the lisa interferometer will be of the order of @xmath42 at @xmath57 @xcite and in that case it is    @xmath58    then , a stochastic background of relic gravitational waves could be in principle detected by the lisa interferometer .",
    "we also hope in a further growth in the sensitivity of advanced projects .",
    "we emphasize that the assumption that all the tensor perturbation in the universe are due to a sbgws is quite strong , but our results ( [ eq : limite spettro wmap ] ) , ( [ eq : limite per lo strain ] ) , ( [ eq : limite per lo strain2 ] ) and ( [ eq : limite per lo strain3 ] ) can be considered like upper bounds .    resuming , in this section the sbgws has been analysed with the aid of the wmap data , while previous works in the literature used the old cobe data , seeing that the predicted signal for these relic gws is very weak . from our analysis",
    "it resulted that the wmap bound on the energy spectrum and on the characteristic amplitude of the sbgws are greater than the cobe ones , but they are also far below frequencies of the earth - based antennas band .",
    "in fact , the integration time of a potential detection with advanced interferometers is very long , thus , for a possible detection , we have to hope in a further growth in the sensitivity of advanced ground based projects and in the lisa interferometer .",
    "gws are the perturbations @xmath59 of the metric @xmath60 which transform as three - tensors . following @xcite ,",
    "the gw - equations in the tt gauge are    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the usual dalembert operator and these equations are derived from the einstein field equations deduced from the einstein - hilbert lagrangian density @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "clearly , matter perturbations do not appear in ( [ eq : dalembert ] ) since scalar and tensor perturbations do not couple with tensor perturbations in einstein equations .",
    "the latin indices run from 1 to 3 , the greek ones from 0 to 3 .",
    "our task is now to derive the analogous of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dalembert ] ) assuming a generic theory of gravity given by the action @xmath64    where , for a sake of simplicity , we have discarded matter contributions .",
    "a conform analysis will help in this goal .",
    "in fact , assuming the conform transformation @xmath65    where the conform rescaling @xmath66    has been chosen being the prime the derivative in respect to the ricci curvature scalar and @xmath67 the `` conform scalar field '' , we obtain the conform equivalent hilbert - einstein action @xmath68,\\label{eq : conform}\\ ] ]    where @xmath69 is the conform scalar field contribution derived from    @xmath70    and @xmath71    in any case , as we will see , the @xmath69-term does not affect the gws - tensor equations , thus it will not be considered any longer ( note : a scalar component in gws is often considered @xcite , but here we are taking into account only the genuine tensor part of stochastic background ) .",
    "starting from the action ( [ eq : conform ] ) and deriving the einstein - like conform equations , the gws equations are @xmath72    expressed in the conform metric @xmath73 as no scalar perturbation couples to the tensor part of gravitational waves , it is    @xmath74    which means that @xmath75 is a conform invariant .    as a consequence , the plane wave amplitude @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the polarization tensor , are the same in both metrics . in any case",
    "the dalembert operator transforms as    @xmath78    and this means that the background is changing while the tensor wave amplitude is fixed .    in order to study the cosmological stochastic background , the operator ( [ eq : quadratello ] )",
    "can be specified for a friedman - robertson - walker metric @xcite , and eq .",

    "for example , assuming power law behaviors for @xmath81 and @xmath84 that is    @xmath85    it is easy to show that general relativity is recovered for @xmath86 while    @xmath87    is the relation between the parameters for a generic @xmath88 where @xmath89 with @xmath90 @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : m n ] ) , a singular case is for @xmath105 and @xmath106 it is clear that the conform invariant plane - wave amplitude evolution of the tensor gw strictly depends on the background .",
    "now , let us take into account the issue of the production of relic gws contributing to the stochastic background .",
    "several mechanisms can be considered as cosmological populations of astrophysical sources @xcite , vacuum fluctuations , phase transitions @xcite and so on . in principle",
    ", we could seek for contributions due to every high - energy physical process in the early phases of the universe evolution .",
    "it is important to distinguish processes coming from transitions like inflation , where the hubble flow emerges in the radiation dominated phase and processes , like the early star formation rates , where the production takes place during the dust dominated era . in the first case ,",
    "stochastic gws background is strictly related to the cosmological model .",
    "this is the case we are considering here which is , furthermore , also connected to the specific theory of gravity .",
    "in particular , one can assume that the main contribution to the stochastic background comes from the amplification of vacuum fluctuations at the transition between an inflationary phase and the radiation - dominated era .",
    "however , in any inflationary model , we can assume that the relic gws generated as zero - point fluctuations during the inflation undergoes adiabatically damped oscillations ( @xmath107 ) until they reach the hubble radius @xmath108 this is the particle horizon for the growth of perturbations .",
    "on the other hand , any other previous fluctuation is smoothed away by the inflationary expansion .",
    "the gws freeze out for @xmath109 and re - enter the @xmath110 radius after the reheating in the friedman era @xcite .",
    "re - entering in the radiation dominated or in the dust - dominated era depends on the scale of the gw .",
    "after the re - entering , gws can be detected by their sachs - wolfe effect on the temperature anisotropy @xmath111 at the decoupling @xcite . when @xmath67 acts as the inflaton @xcite we have @xmath112 during the inflation . considering the conformal time @xmath113 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : evoluzione h ] ) reads@xmath114    where @xmath115 and derivation is with respect to @xmath116 inflation means that @xmath117 and then @xmath118 and @xmath119 the exact solution of ( [ eq : evoluzione h 3 ] ) is @xmath120.\\label{eq : sol ev h2}\\ ] ]    inside the @xmath121 radius it is @xmath122 furthermore , considering the absence of gravitons in the initial vacuum state , we have only negative - frequency modes and then the adiabatic behavior is @xmath123    at the first horizon crossing ( @xmath124 ) , the averaged amplitude @xmath125 of the perturbations is @xmath126    when the scale @xmath127 grows larger than the hubble radius @xmath128 the growing mode of evolution is constant , that it is frozen .",
    "this situation corresponds to the limit @xmath129 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sol ev h2 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath67 acts as the inflaton field , it is @xmath130 at re - entering ( after the end of inflation ) .",
    "then , the amplitude @xmath131 of the wave is preserved until the second horizon crossing after which it can be observed , in principle , as an anisotropy perturbation of the cbr .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath132 is an upper limit to @xmath131 since other effects can contribute to the background anisotropy @xcite . from this consideration , it is clear that the only relevant quantity is the initial amplitude @xmath133 in equation ( [ eq : sol ev h3 ] ) which is conserved until the re - entering .",
    "such an amplitude directly depends on the fundamental mechanism generating perturbations .",
    "inflation gives rise to processes capable of producing perturbations as zero - point energy fluctuations .",
    "such a mechanism depends on the adopted theory of gravitation and then @xmath111 could constitute a further constraint to select a suitable f(r)-theory . considering a single graviton in the form of a monochromatic wave , its zero - point amplitude is derived through the commutation relations @xmath134=i\\delta^{3}(x - y),\\label{eq : commutare}\\ ] ]    calculated at a fixed time @xmath135 where the amplitude @xmath136 is the field and @xmath137 is the conjugate momentum operator .",

    "the amplitude of relic gws produced during inflation depends on the given theory of gravity that , if different from general relativity , gives extra degrees of freedom which assume the role of inflaton field in the cosmological dynamics @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the sachs - wolfe effect related to the cmbr temperature anisotropy could constitute a powerful tool to test the true theory of gravity at early epochs , i.e. at very high redshift .",

    "<S> this paper is a review of previous works on the stochastic background of gravitational waves ( sbgws ) which has been discussed in various peer - reviewed journals and international conferences . </S>",
    "<S> the sbgws is analyzed with the aid of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that , in general , in previous works in the literature about the sbgws , old cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) data were used . </S>",
    "<S> after this , we want to face the problem of how the sbgws and f(r ) gravity ( where f(r ) is a function of the ricci scalar r ) can be related , showing , vice versa , that a revealed sbgws could be a powerful probe for a given theory of gravity . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , it will also be shown that the conform treatment of sbgws can be used to parametrize in a natural way f(r ) theories . some interesting examples which have been recently discussed in the literature will be also analysed .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence and the potential detection of the sbgws is quite important in the framework of the debate on high - frequency gravitational waves ( hfgws ) too . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the importance of hfgws has been emphasized in some papers in the literature .    </S>",
