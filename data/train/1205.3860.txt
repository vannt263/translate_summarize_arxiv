    "the production cross sections of @xmath4 and @xmath5 pairs at @xmath6 tev are calculated to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and their correlated contributions to the dilepton continuum are subsequently obtained .",
    "we also include the effect of energy loss of charm and bottom quarks in the medium consistent with measurements of the suppression factor @xmath19 on the lepton spectra from semileptonic decays of charm and bottom @xcite .",
    "these contributions are compared to direct dilepton production from the drell - yan process and from thermal production in the medium .",
    "we then evaluate the relative importance of these contributions in the lhc detector acceptances .    while there have been previous studies of pb+pb collisions at 5.5 tev @xcite ,",
    "a re - examination is appropriate at the current , lower , center of mass energy and with the final detector acceptances .",
    "in addition , updated parameterizations of the parton distribution functions as well as estimates of the effect of energy loss on single particle spectra and determinations of the initial temperature from the charged particle multiplicity are now available and should lead to improved predictions .",

    "<S> the dilepton invariant mass spectrum measured in heavy - ion collisions includes contributions from important qgp probes such as thermal radiation and the quarkonium ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) states . </S>",

    "<S> semileptonic decays of heavy flavor hadrons provide a substantial contribution to the dilepton continuum . because the dilepton continuum can provide quantitative information on heavy quark yields and their medium modifications , it is important to identify which dilepton sources populate different parts of the continuum . in the present study </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate @xmath4 and @xmath5 production and determine their contributions to the dilepton continuum in pb+pb collisions at @xmath6 tev with and without including heavy quark energy loss . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the rates for drell - yan and thermal dilepton production . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions to the continuum from these dilepton sources are studied in the kinematic ranges relevant for the lhc detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively high @xmath7 cutoff for single leptons excludes most dileptons produced by the thermal medium . </S>",
    "<S> heavy flavors are the dominant source of dilepton production in all the kinematic regimes except at forward rapidities where drell - yan dileptons become dominant for masses greater than 10 gev/@xmath8 . </S>"
