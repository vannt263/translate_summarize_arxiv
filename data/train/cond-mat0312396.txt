    "josephson weak links are typically created by connecting two initially independent superconducting or superfluid systems via a barrier with dimensions of the order of the system healing length . such junctions lead to a variety of interesting phenomena @xcite , including dc- and ac - josephson effects .",
    "observations in superconductors preceded those in superfluids , due to the much larger healing lengths , thus enabling easier fabrication of weak links .",
    "evidence for josephson - like effects has been observed in @xmath0he weak links @xcite , and unequivocally demonstrated for weakly - coupled @xmath1he systems @xcite .",
    "the recent achievement of dilute trapped atomic bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) @xcite gives rise to a new system for studying josephson effects .",
    "in particular , such systems enable the investigation of dynamical regimes not easily accessible with other superconducting or superfluid systems .",
    "remarkable experimental progress has led to the creation of atomic bec josephson junction arrays , in which the harmonically trapped atoms are additionally confined by an optical lattice potential , generated by far - detuned laser beams .",
    "phase coherence in different wells was observed by interference experiments of condensates released from the lattice @xcite .",
    "in addition , josephson effects @xcite and the control of tunnelling rate have been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "alternative insight into the diverse range of josephson phenomena can be obtained by looking at a single jospehson junction arising in a double - well system .",
    "this system has already received considerable theoretical attention , with treatments based on a two - state approximation @xcite , zero temperature mean field theory @xcite , quantum phase models @xcite and instanton methods @xcite .",

    "in particular , preparation in the odd parity energy eigenstate combined with the application of the potential gradient leads to a flow towards a region of higher potential energy providing a clear signature of josephson tunnelling . flow reversal in context of the josephson effect is well known .",
    "for example in a superconducting @xmath2-junction @xcite , the addition of a macroscopic phase difference @xmath3 across the superconducting weak link leads to reversal of the sign of the current @xcite .",

    "3(b ) provides a clear macroscopic demonstration of quantum tunnelling . to consider whether this effect is observable in current experimental set - ups , we have studied the effect of varying the nonlinearity , trap geometry , and the time dependence of the ramp .",
    "note that , the effect of interactions has also been considered in @xcite , with the effective interaction also modified by atom losses @xcite .",
    "our studies reveal that increasing the nonlinearity causes a reduction in the amount of initial flow to the upper well , and thus tends to inhibit the experimental observation ( see next section for experimental estimates ) . for example , using the parameters of fig .",
    "3 with a nonlinearity ten times larger ( i.e. @xmath90 ) , leads to a reduction of the average population imbalance induced by the applied potential gradient of slightly more than a factor of 2 .",
    "it is thus natural to ask if other factors ( e.g. modifying initial trap aspect ratio , or changing barrier height @xmath21 ) will have the opposite effect .",
    "enhanced tunnelling has been predicted for ` pancake ' traps ( @xmath91 ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , such geometries feature a larger energy splitting between the ground and first excited state , making them more robust to external perturbations ( e.g. thermal @xcite ) .",
    "however , the suppression of tunnelling induced by increased nonlinearities can not be compensated by changing the geometry .",
    "we should further comment on the extent to which the above findings depend on the rate @xmath92 with which the linear potential gradient @xmath42 is applied .",
    "3(a ) shows the dependence for @xmath93 .",
    "if @xmath92 is increased by a factor of 10 then the maximum flow to the right well is reduced by roughly a factor of 2 . also flow to higher potential region",
    "can only be observed for approximately one tenth of the time , unless the gradient is ramped up to a particular value and subsequently kept constant .",
    "if the gradient is kept constant at the point of maximum population difference , the population remains trapped in the right upper well , i.e. , macroscopic quantum self - trapping @xcite occurs to a state with higher potential energy . in this regime , where the gradient does not exceed the value at which the flow is reversed , the two - state model correctly predicts the behaviour .",
    "we now discuss the feasibility of observing flow to the upper well using phase imprinting @xcite . starting from the condensate ground state in a symmetric double - well trap ,",
    "population can be transferred to the excited states by applying a light - induced potential of the form @xmath94 for ( @xmath95 ) , where @xmath51 and @xmath96 are constants which we vary . at @xmath97 ,",
    "the potential @xmath98 is suddenly switched off such that there is a @xmath2 phase shift between the two wells .",
    "this simple phase - imprinting method does not distinguish between states with similar density and phase profiles such as @xmath61 or @xmath73 .",
    "other more sophisticated methods of preparing the initial state such as 2-photon adiabatic passage @xcite could also be explored .",
    "we choose the phase imprinting parameters such that the amplitude of the subsequent number oscillations between the wells in a symmetric double - well potential ( i.e. in the absence of a potential gradient ) are minimized .",
    "the time dynamics for this case are shown by the grey lines in fig . 4 , and essentially correspond to @xmath2-oscillations with @xmath99 , as discussed in @xcite and shown in fig .",
    "for an imprinted phase of @xmath2 , the population oscillates with most of the condensate in the left well ( grey line in fig .",
    "4(a ) ) , while for an imprinted phase of @xmath100 , the population oscillations are contained within the right well ( grey line in fig .",
    "4(b ) ) . in both cases , the addition of the potential gradient at a time indicated by the open circle in fig .  4 , induces a flow to the right or upper potential well ( solid lines in fig .",
    "4 ) . even at the time in the @xmath2-oscillation cycle",
    "when most of the population is already on the right well and would subsequently flow back to the left , the addition of the gradient induces more flow to the right , as shown in fig .",
    "note that , in this case , the population remains trapped in the right well until the influence of the second excited state becomes important .",
    "if the correct initial state parameters are obtained from the full gp calculation , then the results shown in fig .",
    "4 can be reproduced using the two - state model , except for the transition to the second excited state .",
    "however , a full potential calculation is required to correctly predict the initial state and the dynamics for larger potential gradients , when the two - state model breaks down .     as a function of time for initial states prepared by phase imprinting ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) .",
    "the grey and black curves correspond respectively to the absence of a potential gradient ( i.e. symmetric double well ) , and the addition of a potential gradient @xmath103 increased linearly at rate @xmath104 from time @xmath105 , with this time indicated by the open circles .",

    "the number of atoms is given by @xmath110 the total atom number is independent of the trap aspect ratio , therefore , for given dimensionless nonlinearity @xmath111 , large atom numbers can be obtained for light , weakly - interacting , transversally weakly - confined systems . for a large number of atoms ,",
    "one should preferably choose species with a small value of @xmath112 .",
    "for example , taking @xmath113 and @xmath114 hz , we find : @xmath115 3300 ( @xmath116na ) and 1000 ( @xmath117rb ) .",
    "an enhancement of the atom number by a factor of 10 may be possible by tuning around a feshbach resonance ( e.g. @xmath116na , @xmath118rb , @xmath119cs ) @xcite . in the case of @xmath120li and @xmath118rb ,",
    "the number of atoms needed to observe such josephson flow is not likely to exceed the critical value@xcite for collapse .",
    "note that for fixed , reasonably small , nonlinearity ( @xmath121 ) , such that the effect can be clearly observed , one needs weak transverse confinement @xmath9 in order to obtain a reasonable number of atoms which can be imaged easily .",
    "however , small @xmath9 imply long timescales , such that the observation of this effect becomes limited by other factors ( e.g. thermal damping @xcite , atom losses @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "if we choose @xmath122hz , then the preparation of the @xmath61 state requires a time @xmath123ms . and an applied field gradient @xmath124 ( which translates into a zeeman shift of ( 1@xmath125100 mhz)/cm ) ramped up over a time @xmath126 ( 1.5 s@xmath12575 ms ) .",
    "we have studied the josephson dynamics of phase - imprinted condensates in a double - well potential in the presence of a time - dependent potential gradient .",
    "we show that phase imprinting can lead to a significant change in the flow direction producing a clear signature of macroscopic quantum tunnelling .",
    "we have discussed the range of parameters for optimum experimental demonstration of this effect , and find that it is only weakly - dependent on the aspect ratio of the trap .",
    "however , suppression of the flow for large nonlinearities , restricts the condensate size to a few thousand atoms . an attractive candidate for the observation of the flow reversal",
    "is the recently realized atom chips @xcite with a blue detuned laser beam to create the weak link .",
    "the observation of the flow of phase imprinted states would provide a clear experimental demonstration of the josephson effect .",
