    "following einstein s insight that gravity is encoded into the geometry of spacetime , quantum gravity aims at providing realizations of quantum geometry . in this task ,",
    "one key technical and conceptual challenge is to reconcile the regularizations required in quantum field theory with the diffeomorphism symmetry which underlies general relativity . indeed ,",
    "a number of approaches employ discretizations as regulators , which is the case for instance of regge calculus @xcite , and in this class of theories , where one attempts to represent geometrical data on a triangulation , diffeomorphism symmetry is generically broken @xcite .    in light of this ,",
    "a very important result is therefore the construction of a continuum notion of quantum geometry , which was achieved in the context of loop quantum gravity @xcite ( lqg hereafter ) by ashtekar , isham , and lewandowski @xcite .",
    "the so - called ashtekar  lewandowski ( al ) representation provides a hilbert space representation of the kinematical algebra of observable of the full _ continuum _ theory .",
    "this kinematical algebra of observable encodes the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of a spatial hypersurface into holonomies measuring curvature ( of the ashtekar  barbero connection @xcite ) and fluxes measuring the spatial geometry .",
    "most importantly , this kinematical setup allows to deal successfully with spatial diffeomorphisms .",
    "indeed , there exists a fully kinematical hilbert space describing geometry in a coordinate - dependent way , and on which the diffeomorphisms act unitarily .",
    "the fact that the diffeomorphisms act unitarily also allows to define a hilbert space of spatially diffeomorphism - invariant states , and , quite noticeably , this task has so far only been achieved in the ( ashtekar ) connection formulation of general relativity @xcite .",
    "the kinematical hilbert space allows for a rigorous definition of the quantum dynamics in the form of hamiltonian constraints @xcite , and one can hope to construct the physical hilbert space , which would incorporate spacetime diffeomorphism - invariant states , from the solutions to these constraints .    in the present article ,",
    "building upon the earlier work @xcite , we construct an alternative realization of a continuum quantum geometry , which is unitarily inequivalent to the ashtekar  lewandowski representation .",
    "we hope that this new framework will make the description of states describing configurations with macroscopic geometry much easier .",
    "the reason for this expectation is that the new representation which we are constructing here supports states which are peaked on an almost everywhere flat connection ( we therefore call this representation the bf representation , since the bf vacuum is peaked on a flat connection ) .",
    "curvature has only distributional support on defects , which brings us much nearer to regge s proposal @xcite of approximating general relativity by a very dense gas of defects in an otherwise flat geometry .",
    "as explained in more detail in the overview given in section [ overview ] , our construction leads to a continuum hilbert space which supports arbitrarily many excitations in the form of defects .",
    "in fact , both the al representation and the bf representation can be interpreted in this way . for the al representation , it is the defects themselves which generate ( non - degenerate ) geometry , and therefore a macroscopic geometry corresponds to a highly excited state . for the bf representation however ,",
    "the states have ( almost everywhere ) maximal uncertainty in spatial geometry since they are peaked on the conjugated variable , namely on flat connections .",
    "there are numerous proposals to approximate the dynamics of general relativity by mostly flat geometries with defects , either in the classical theory @xcite , or in the context of lqg @xcite .",
    "another related class of approaches is the combinatorial quantization of flat connections in three spacetime dimensions @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we construct for the first time a hilbert space carrying a representation of a continuum observable algebra and supporting states which are peaked on almost everywhere flat connections .",
    "this continuum construction has important consequences .",
    "in particular , it requires the compactification ( or the exponentiation ) of the fluxes , and with it the introduction of a discrete topology for the holonomy group parameters .",
    "this in turn changes the properties of , e.g. , the spectra of observables like the area operator .",
    "our construction of the continuum hilbert space is done via a so - called inductive limit . as is explained in more detail in section [ overview ] ,",
    "such a constructions allows one to keep the cake and to eat it too . for most purposes ,",
    "it is sufficient to deal with a discretization .",
    "however , all the hilbert spaces describing states restricted to such discretizations are embedded into a continuum hilbert space .",
    "the properties of observables are therefore changed further due to redefining ( as compared to the al representation ) the way in which the observables on hilbert spaces associated to discretizations are related to the observables on the continuum hilbert space . for the bf representation ,",
    "this relation is based on a geometric coarse - graining of the fluxes , which allows to address for example the staircase problem appearing for geometric operators in the al representation .",
    "this work is divided in two main parts .",
    "we start in section [ sec : configuration space ] by providing a characterization of the ( cotangent ) space of flat connections on manifolds with a fixed number of defects , where the positioning of the defects is prescribed by a choice of triangulation .",
    "we then define in section [ sec : inner product ] an inner product ( compatible with the inductive limit construction which comes afterwards ) which leads to a discrete topology on the group .",
    "this discrete topology on the group implies that dealing with gauge invariance is far less trivial than in the al case .",
    "we bypass this difficulty by working with the space of almost gauge - invariant wave functions , and employ a group averaging for the remaining global adjoint action . in section [ sec : quantization algebra ] , we construct a representation of holonomies and ( exponentiated ) fluxes which are supported by the triangulation .",
    "this already allows us to discuss the spectra of these operators , and also that of the area operator , which we do in section [ sec : area ] .    in the second main part of this work",
    ", we construct the continuum hilbert space via an inductive limit .",
    "this first requires the definition of embeddings that map hilbert spaces associated to coarser triangulations into hilbert spaces associated to finer triangulations .",
    "we therefore develop a number of technical results in section [ sec : refinement ] , which allow in particular to obtain a convenient splitting of the observables into coarser observables and finer observables . in section [ sec : inductive limit ] , we describe the construction of the inductive limit hilbert space .",
    "we then discuss how to relate the operators on the various hilbert spaces in order to define a notion of continuum operators in sections [ sec : extop ] and [ contop ] . finally , we close with a discussion of our results in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the appendices include a more detailed elaboration on the configuration space of flat connections , a number of proofs of theorems needed in the main text , as well as the construction of the ( intertwiner- ) spin representation for the wave functions , which replaces the usual spin network states of the al representation .",
    "in order to construct the _ continuum _ hilbert space , we proceed in the same way as for the al representation , namely by considering an inductive limit of hilbert spaces .",
    "let us explain why this construction is very natural in a background - independent context .",
    "this will also allow us to explain how the new realization of quantum geometry presented here can be seen as one member of a potentially much bigger class of quantum geometries @xcite .",
    "we usually organize hilbert space representations into a vacuum and excitations , where the excitations are generated by applying the observable algebra to the vacuum state .",
    "the vacuum states we are dealing with for both the al and the new representation are states which are sharply peaked on a certain configuration , as opposed to the gaussian states of free field theory for which one needs to specify a background metric . for the al representation ,",
    "one has a vacuum which is sharply peaked on a totally degenerate spatial geometry , i.e. in which all flux observables annihilate the vacuum . for the representation constructed in this work ,",
    "the vacuum state is very different : it is sharply peaked on a ( globally and locally ) flat connection .",
    "in fact , such states which are sharply peaked on a flat connection can be described by ( first class ) constraints arising from a topological field theory ( these constraints play also an important role in the classical theory @xcite ) . for the new representation presented here ,",
    "this topological field theory is given by bf theory @xcite , which is also the theory underlying the construction of spin foam models @xcite .",
    "we will therefore refer to the new representation as the bf representation .",
    "the topological field theory for the al representation is a trivial one , and coincides with the strong coupling limit of yang ",
    "mills theory , whereas bf theory arises from a zero coupling limit @xcite .",
    "the topological field theory in itself does however not provide room for local excitations , and therefore does not give a representation of the observable algebra which is supposed to be generating such excitations . in order to add excitations to the theory",
    ", one needs to allow for the presence of defects , e.g. in the form of a violation of the flatness constraints in the bf case , or of a violation of the flux constraints in the al case .",
    "therefore , the notion of what constitutes a `` defect '' strongly depends on the choice of vacuum . in the case of the al representation ,",
    "a `` defect '' actually means an excitation which allows to have at least some of the spatial geometrical operators with non - vanishing values .",
    "this would rather be an `` anti - defect '' of geometry if one understands a degenerate geometry as being highly defected .",
    "defects play also an important role in condensed matter applications @xcite . in this case , one wishes to describe localized excitations which are separated by very large distances so that they do not interact with each other .",
    "therefore , the precise values of the distances , i.e. the metric geometry , does not actually matter .",
    "this justifies a posteriori the use of the vacuum ( or the physical state ) of a topological field theory : it ensures that only relations of topological nature between the defects actually matter ( for instance how two line defects wind around each other ) .",
    "furthermore , it explains why frameworks for describing defects are applicable to quantum gravity , since the metric properties are then not encoded in a background , but in the defect configurations themselves .",
    "a second property which one usually assigns to defects is a discreteness for their `` charge '' labels . in condensed matter , this arises since one needs finite energy gaps between the vacuum and the excitations described by the defects , so that there is a notion of adiabatically moving the defects around .",
    "interestingly , there is a similar discreteness of the charges describing the defects in the framework of quantum geometry .",
    "this arises however due to a different reason , namely in the way in which the continuum limit is constructed .    to construct the continuum limit",
    ", one starts with a family of hilbert spaces where each hilbert space describes a fixed number of defects . for a diffeomorphism - covariant description",
    ", one does not only fix the number of defects , but also their positions .",
    "this is achieved by embedding a discrete structure , e.g. a graph or a triangulation , into the spatial manifold .",
    "defects are then confined to this discrete structure , for instance line defects to the links of the graph or to the edges of the triangulation .",
    "the degrees of freedom are given by the values of the charges for the defects .",
    "the values can also describe a vanishing charge , which is then equivalent to having no defect .",
    "this is an important point since it allows to embed states realized in a hilbert space based on e.g. a coarse triangulation into a hilbert space based on a refinement of this triangulation .    for the continuum theory ,",
    "one however wishes to allow for an arbitrary number of defects ( at arbitrary positions ) .",
    "one can construct such a continuum hilbert space as an inductive limit of hilbert spaces . a key point in this construction",
    "is the notion of refinement for the discrete structures carrying the defects on the one hand , and for the states on the other hand .",
    "let us consider the example of line defects confined to a graph embedded into the manifold .",
    "one possible refinement of a graph is to add links to it .",
    "the corresponding state for the refined graph is then defined by transposing over all the charge labels from the coarse state , and by assigning the charge labels describing a vanishing defect for the new links . in other words ,",
    "one puts the new additional degrees of freedom into a vacuum state @xcite .    in order to define the inductive hilbert space structure , the refinement operator acting on the states needs to be isometric ( with respect to the inner product defined on the hilbert spaces with a fixed discrete structure ) .",
    "in particular , the vacuum state where all the charges describe vanishing defects should have a finite norm .",
    "moreover , what happens ( in both the bf and the al representation ) is that the charges label an orthonormal basis for the hilbert spaces associated to a fixed discrete structure .",
    "therefore , even if the charge labels are continuous ( as it is the case with the bf representation , where the labels are elements of the ( lie ) group ) , we will have to equip the space of charge values with a discrete topology .    if we see the charge labels as momentum space , then a discrete topology on momentum space corresponds to a compactification of the configuration space .",
    "this compactification can be understood in the following way for the two representations :    * in the al representation , the configuration space associated to a fixed discrete structure is given by group holonomies along the links of embedded graphs , and therefore corresponds to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a compact lie group ( usually @xmath2 ) , and @xmath3 denotes the number of allowed defects , which in this case coincides with the number of links of the graph .",
    "the inductive limit of hilbert spaces amounts to a projective limit for the configuration space , in which compactness is preserved ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the space of charge labels is constructed through the group fourier transform and given by representation labels ( and magnetic indices ) .",
    "this space does indeed naturally carry a discrete topology ( for a compact group @xmath1 ) .",
    "* in the bf representation , the configuration variables are actually the fluxes and [ intertwinerspin ] . ] , which correspond to the dual of the lie group .",
    "we therefore need to consider a compactification of this space .",
    "in fact , for the group @xmath4 the ( pontryagin ) dual is given by the abelian group @xmath5 , which can be bohr - compactified .",
    "this in turn leads to a discrete topology on @xmath4 . for @xmath6 , it is however easier to start with a discrete topology , and to then derive the compactification of the dual space via a ( generalized ) group fourier transform .",
    "this is described in appendix [ spinrepsu2 ] .",
    "therefore , we see that the inductive limit construction leads to a compactification of the underlying configuration spaces .",
    "this also explains the difficulty to define a projective limit hilbert space ( in the al representation ) for a non - compact group like @xmath7 , since this latter can not easily be compactified , one can use the bohr compactification @xcite .",
    "it might actually be easier to compactify the dual of @xmath7 , which would then allow for a bf representation . ] .",
    "the compactification of the fluxes has important repercussions for the properties , and in particular the spectrum , of the observables . due to the discrete topology on the ( lie ) group",
    ", the fluxes can not act anymore as ( lie ) derivatives like in the al representation .",
    "instead , one has to replace the fluxes with translation operators labelled by a translation group element @xmath8 . due to the compactification",
    ", the spectrum of these translation operators is bounded . however , depending on the choice of @xmath8 , the spectrum can be either discrete or continuous .",
    "the continuous spectrum arises if the action of the translation operator on the group is ergodic .",
    "we will provide a more detailed discussion of these features in section [ sec : area ] .",
    "a ( bohr ) compactification is also employed in another context in loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite . in this case ,",
    "one compactifies @xmath9 , which describes the momentum conjugated to the scale factor ( this momentum @xmath10 is proportional to the connection degree of freedom ) .",
    "this then leads to a discrete topology for the scale factor .",
    "note that in lqc ( point ) holonomies are compact while the conjugated momentum discrete , which is the reversed situation as compared to the bf representation .",
    "it is also well - known that compactifications lead to non - separable hilbert spaces .",
    "let us comment more on this issue , and in particular on the fact that there are now two different sources of non - separability .",
    "* the first source of non - separability arises from the inductive limit hilbert space construction based on _ embedded _ discrete structures .",
    "this can be interpreted as introducing a discrete topology for the underlying spatial manifold .",
    "this is also mirrored in the interpretation of defects in condensed matter as charges which lie at large distance from one another .",
    "here , we declare for instance any point ( in the case in which the defects are point - like ) of the underlying manifold to be separated from any other point ( mathematically , these points define open sets ) , which gives rise to the discrete topology .",
    "+ one can however expect that this kind of non - separability will be lifted ( to a large extent ) if one constructs the spatial diffeomorphism - invariant hilbert space",
    ". indeed , diffeomorphisms act by changing the embeddings of the discrete structures , and therefore the positioning of the defects .",
    "for a diffeomorphism - invariant description only the relative ( topological ) positions of the defects matter . * in the bf representation , we encounter a second kind of non - separability , which results from the discrete topology on the space of charge labels .",
    "this non - separability will not be lifted by implementing spatial diffeomorphism symmetry .",
    "there is however the possibility that it can be lifted for the physical hilbert space if one includes a positive cosmological constant ( at least in the euclidean theory ) . in this case",
    ", the large spin @xmath11 labels in the spin representation might become irrelevant : for instance , the area eigenvalues first grow with growing spin , and then start ( depending on the value of @xmath8 ) to oscillate .",
    "therefore , very large spins are in a sense not needed since they lead to similar area eigenvalues as the smaller spins .",
    "+ one can also introduce a quantum deformation of the group at root of unity , i.e. work with @xmath12 .",
    "in this case , the cutoff on the spin is implemented explicitly .",
    "the charge labels are then described by the drinfeld center of the @xmath12 module category , which has only finitely many objects @xcite . in three spacetime dimensions ,",
    "the corresponding vacuum is given by the turaev ",
    "viro state sum model @xcite and describes ( euclidean ) gravity with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "future work @xcite will be concerned with constructing a continuum hilbert space representation based on quantum groups .",
    "in this section we briefly summarize the setup of our construction , and present the notations and notions which are used throughout the rest of the article .",
    "we refer the reader to the companion paper @xcite for more details .",
    "let @xmath13 be a @xmath14-dimensional closed ( i.e. compact and without boundary ) manifold , which we choose to be real , analytic , orientable , and path - connected .",
    "we will be interested in particular in the cases @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which we treat simultaneously .",
    "the manifold @xmath13 can be thought of as a spatial boundary , and our aim is to construct states corresponding to @xmath14-dimensional boundary quantum geometries on it .",
    "for this , we consider a principal @xmath1-bundle @xmath17 , where the gauge group @xmath1 is an arbitrary compact lie group whose lie algebra will be denoted by @xmath18 . if @xmath1 is simply - connected ( which is the case for @xmath2 , the gauge group of interest in this work ) , since we consider the case @xmath19 it is always possible to pick a global trivialization of @xmath20 , which we do for simplicity .",
    "the space @xmath21 of smooth @xmath1 connections is then affine over @xmath22 , the space of @xmath18-valued one - form fields over @xmath13 , and the group of local gauge transformations is given by @xmath23 .",
    "on the phase space of lqg , a connection @xmath24 is canonically conjugated to a @xmath25-valued vector density @xmath26 ( the electric field ) of weight + 1 .",
    "if we write @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 are coordinates on @xmath13 and @xmath30 forms a basis of @xmath18 , the non - vanishing poisson brackets are given by [ firstequ ] a^i_a(x),e^b_j(y)=^b_a^i_j^d(x , y ) .",
    "following the logic of lqg , we are going to consider holonomies of the connection and fluxes of the electric field as our elementary variables .",
    "however , instead of assigning this data to arbitrary oriented embedded ( dual ) graphs and @xmath31-dimensional submanifolds , as is done in the usual construction of the holonomy - flux @xmath32-algebra , here we adopt a simplicial point of view and focus rather on the triangulation itself .",
    "we now explain the type of discrete data which is relevant for our construction .",
    "we consider a fiducial riemannian metric on the manifold @xmath13 , and the infinite set of embedded ( or geometric ) triangulations @xmath33 defined by this metric . in both @xmath15 and @xmath16 dimensions ,",
    "these embeddings refer to the vertices of the triangulations .",
    "the edges and ( in @xmath16 ) the triangles of a given triangulation are defined respectively as geodesics and minimal surfaces with respect to the auxiliary metric .",
    "we furthermore assume that the triangulations are fine enough so that these geodesics and minimal surfaces are unique .    to each triangulation",
    "@xmath33 we assign a dual graph @xmath34 , which is the one - skeleton of the cellular complex dual to @xmath33 .",
    "this dual graph is such that its nodes @xmath35 are dual to the @xmath14-dimensional simplices @xmath36 of @xmath33 , while its links @xmath37 are dual to the @xmath31-dimensional simplices @xmath38 of @xmath33 . for each link",
    "we choose a fiducial orientation , and denote by @xmath39 and @xmath40 the source and target nodes .    to each pair given by a triangulation and its dual graph",
    "we then assign a root , which is a choice of a preferred @xmath14-dimensional root simplex @xmath41 , or equivalently ( by duality ) a choice of a preferred root node @xmath42 .",
    "this in turn defines a rooted geometric triangulation . in order to describe the behavior of this root under the refining operations , we further equip the root simplex with a flag structure , which consists simply in a choice of nondisjoint lower - dimensional simplices @xmath43 .    with these structures",
    ", we can finally consider the infinite set of flagged rooted geometric triangulations of a given manifold @xmath13 . on this set",
    ", we now choose the refinement operations to be the alexander moves .",
    "these alexander moves refine a given triangulation by subdividing a @xmath44-dimensional simplex , where @xmath45 , with the addition of a new ( embedded ) vertex . as explained in @xcite ,",
    "if the root of a triangulation is subdivided by a move , the flag structure defines in a canonical manner a new root for the refined triangulation .    a geometric triangulation @xmath46 is said to be finer than a geometric triangulation @xmath33 if it can be obtained form @xmath33 by a ( finite ) sequence of refining alexander moves , and if its vertices after the moves have the same coordinates as those of @xmath33 .",
    "we will denote this relation by @xmath47 .",
    "in oder to unambiguously specify paths @xmath48 in a graph @xmath34 and to obtain a characterization of the fundamental cycles of this graph ( and to perform a gauge - fixing ) , it is convenient to introduce ( maximal spanning ) trees .    a maximal or spanning tree @xmath49 in a graph @xmath34 is a connected subgraph of @xmath34 which does not contain any closed cycles and includes all the nodes of @xmath34 . in the rest of the paper we use",
    "` tree ' as short form for maximal connected tree .",
    "the links composing a tree are called branches and denoted by @xmath50 , while the links of the graph that are not in the tree are called leaves and denoted by @xmath51 .",
    "although the leaves correspond to the links in @xmath52 , by abuse of language we will refer to the leaves of the tree .",
    "the set of leaves in a tree will be denoted by @xmath53 .",
    "a rooted tree with root @xmath42 is a tree where a preferred node is identified and called the root .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between the leaves of a tree and the fundamental cycles of the underlying graph . for a rooted tree , one way to characterize these cycles",
    "is to associate them with paths @xmath54 labeled by the leaves in @xmath53 .",
    "a path @xmath54 starts at the root , goes along the branches of the tree until the source node of the leaf @xmath51 , then goes along @xmath51 , and back to the root along branches .",
    "the cardinality of the set of fundamental cycles is independent of the choice of tree .",
    "explicitly , if we denote by @xmath55 the number of nodes in the graph @xmath34 and by @xmath56 the number of links , then any given tree has @xmath57 branches and @xmath58 leaves ( and fundamental cycles ) .",
    "as explained in the introduction , to construct the full continuum quantum theory we will proceed in two steps . in this first part",
    ", we are going to define the quantum theory on a fixed triangulation .",
    "for this , we will first focus on the classical connection configuration space , then on the inner product and hilbert space structure built upon it , and finally on the quantization of the algebra of holonomies and fluxes .",
    "this will enable us in particular to discuss the properties of the area operator .",
    "in the second part we will then show the existence of a continuum ( inductive limit ) hilbert space .",
    "in this section , we focus on the connection degrees of freedom and describe the configuration space of smooth @xmath1 connections on the spatial manifold @xmath13 . in the al framework , the quantum theory is built over a suitable generalization of @xmath21 which is the space @xmath59 of generalized connections . in the present context however , as we shall see , by configuration space we mean the space of classical states which reflect the geometrical properties of the states of our ( yet - to - be built ) quantum theory , which turns out to be the moduli space of flat connections on the spatial manifold @xmath13 with certain defects . ]",
    "over which we are going to build the quantum theory .",
    "the bf vacuum is a state locally and globally peaked on flat connections .",
    "this property can be encoded in the triviality of the holonomies of the connection around the faces of the dual graph @xmath34 ( more precisely , along the fundamental cycles of the graph ) .",
    "excitations over this vacuum locally shift the holonomies away from the identity , thereby creating curvature defects which can be thought of as being carried by the @xmath60-dimensional simplices ( the hinges ) of the triangulation .",
    "for this reason , we are interested in connections which are flat appart from possible conical singularities along the hinges .",
    "if we denote by @xmath61 the @xmath60-skeleton of the triangulation @xmath33 , we are therefore led to considering the space of flat connections on @xmath62 .    as is well - known @xcite , the moduli space of flat connections modulo gauge transformations on a compact and connected manifold @xmath13 is a finite - dimensional orbifold which admits several different ( although equivalent ) mathematical descriptions . in particular",
    ", it is common to describe the quotient _ 0 a|f(a)=0/ in terms of holonomies ( i.e. group homomorphisms ) as [ without defects ] _ 0=(_1(),g)/g , where @xmath1 acts on the space @xmath63 of homomorphisms by diagonal adjoint action .",
    "this defines the space of locally flat connections for a compact and connected manifold @xmath13 without defects .",
    "details about the construction of the first fundamental group @xmath64 can be found in appendix [ appendix : pi1 ] .    in the present work ,",
    "since we are interested in flat connections on the defected manifold @xmath62 , we first have to worry about the fact that this latter is not compact . in order to avoid the inconvenience of working with infinite triangulations",
    ", one can resort to the following construction : first , choose a flat metric on the simplices of @xmath33 ( which can be the auxiliary metric on @xmath13 ) and let , for some small @xmath65 , @xmath66 be the open ball of radius @xmath67 .",
    "then , the set _ ( d-2)^_x_(d-2)b_(x ) , which represents a `` blown - up '' version of @xmath61 , is open in @xmath13 , and if @xmath67 is small enough one has that @xmath62 is homotopy - equivalent to the new manifold @xmath68 .",
    "in fact , one has that @xmath69 is a deformation - retract of @xmath62 .",
    "as such , these two spaces have isomorphic fundamental groups , and we can define our configuration space to be _ ( _ 1(),g)/g .",
    "the question is now how to characterize @xmath70 . to this end",
    "we note that the graph @xmath34 , which is the one - skeleton of the simplicial complex dual to the triangulation @xmath33 of @xmath13 , is a deformation - retract of @xmath71 . as a consequence ,",
    "their first fundamental groups are isomorphic , i.e. @xmath72 .",
    "we are therefore led to considering the first fundamental group @xmath73 of the graph @xmath34 dual to the triangulation @xmath33 .",
    "the first fundamental group @xmath73 of a graph @xmath34 is a free group , and is generated by a set of fundamental cycles of the graph @xcite ( we refer the reader to appendix [ appendix : pi1defects ] for more details ) .",
    "as noted in section [ sec : setup ] , a set of fundamental cycles can be obtained by choosing a maximal spanning tree @xmath49 ( which here in addition will be rooted ) in @xmath34 .",
    "the links of @xmath34 which are not part of the tree are called leaves and denoted by @xmath51 . the set @xmath53 of leaves with respect to a given choice of tree @xmath49 defines a set of fundamental cycles @xmath54 .",
    "such a fundamental cycle @xmath54 starts at the root , goes along the branches of the tree until the source node of the leaf @xmath51 , then goes along @xmath51 , and back to the root along branches .    by definition , a set of fundamental cycles obtained by a choice of tree",
    "does freely generate the first fundamental group @xmath73 .",
    "in other words , if we denote by @xmath54 the cycle associated to the leaf @xmath51 and choose a numbering @xmath74 of the leaves , we have that _ 1 ( ) = _ 1,  ,_|| .",
    "therefore , the space @xmath75 is parametrized by the set of group - valued maps @xmath76 , and by associating to each cycle @xmath54 a group element @xmath77 we can write that ( _ 1(),g ) = \\{g_1,  ,g_|||g_ig}. from this space , we then obtain the space of locally flat connection by dividing out by the diagonal adjoint action of the group on @xmath78 , i.e. _ \\{g_1,  ,g_|||g__ig}/g .",
    "as we will now explain , this space in turn agrees with the space of gauge - invariant ( or gauge - fixed ) holonomies on the graph @xmath34 .",
    "since the @xmath79-tuple @xmath80 determines the holonomies along the fundamental cycles of the graph , it can be used to reconstruct the holonomies along all the cycles ( starting and ending at the root ) in @xmath34 .",
    "a ( suitable ) space of functions of these cycle holonomies therefore gives the space of functions of the graph connection which are invariant under gauge transformations at all the nodes except the root .",
    "let us explain how this comes about .",
    "a graph connection is given by an assignment of group elements @xmath81 to the links @xmath82 of the graph , and the action of a gauge transformation with parameter @xmath83 on @xmath81 factorizes at the nodes and gives u_nh_l = u^-1_l(1)h_lu_l(0 ) .",
    "given a closed cycle @xmath84 with @xmath85 starting at the root and @xmath86 ending at the root , the cycle holonomy @xmath87 is therefore invariant under gauge transformations at all the nodes except at the root . instead , under gauge transformations at the root , it transforms with the adjoint action [ rootgaugetrafo1 ] g^|n|\\{u_n}g_=u^-1_r g_u_r .    by choosing a tree ,",
    "the space of holonomies which are invariant under non - root gauge transformations can again be characterized by the association of group elements to the leaves of the graph . as explained above , for ever leaf",
    "@xmath51 we can consider paths @xmath54 describing the fundamental cycles by starting at the root , going along the tree until the source of @xmath51 , then going along @xmath51 , and back to the root along the tree . to every leaf we can therefore associate a group element [ hcycle ] g_h_e^1 = g_r(1)^-1h_g_r(0 ) .",
    "any other arbitrary cycle holonomy can be obtained by composing the holonomies @xmath77 of the fundamental cycles .",
    "the fundamental cycle holonomies therefore parametrize the space of graph connections which are invariant under non - root gauge transformations .",
    "furthermore we can use the tree to perform a ( partial ) gauge - fixing . given any graph connection @xmath88 there exist a unique gauge transformation @xmath89 , acting on all nodes except the root , such that @xmath90 for all the links @xmath50 which are branches of the tree . here",
    "we use @xmath91 to denote an equality which holds with a particular gauge - fixing . in this gauge",
    ", the holonomy along a fundamental cycle reduces to the holonomy associated to the leaf @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath92 . thus @xmath93 parametrizes the space of almost gauge - invariant graph connections , that is connections invariant under all gauge transformations except the ones at the root .",
    "we can therefore conclude that @xmath78 describes the space of almost gauge - invariant connections on @xmath34 , as well as the space of almost gauge - invariant locally flat connections on the manifolds with defects @xmath71 , which we will denote by @xmath94 .",
    "in this section we introduce the inner product and hilbert space structure on a fixed triangulation . for this",
    ", we first focus on states which are gauge - invariant everywhere appart from the root , and then use the technique of group averaging in order to account for these residual gauge transformations .      our goal is to construct a hilbert space @xmath95 for which the space of almost gauge - invariant graph connections @xmath94 serves as the configuration space , as it would be the case for example in ( at least one approach to ) the quantization of chern  simons theory . ] .",
    "the reason for working with @xmath94 instead of the full gauge - invariant space @xmath96 is that the configuration space @xmath78 is much simpler to handle than the orbifold @xmath97 .",
    "we will therefore first consider @xmath94 , and then impose invariance under the residual gauge transformations at the root via a group averaging procedure .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : configuration space ] , the configuration space @xmath94 is parametrized by a set of group elements in @xmath78 , and the identification of the leaves @xmath51 implicitly means that one has made a choice of tree @xmath49 .",
    "we therefore consider some space @xmath98 of functions as a candidate for our hilbert space @xmath95 , and consider states of the form |\\{g _ } ( g_1,  ,g_|| ) . here",
    "we can interpret the group elements @xmath77 as giving the holonomies associated to the fundamental cycles @xmath54 of the graph @xmath34 . alternatively ,",
    "if we use the tree @xmath49 to gauge - fix the branch holonomies to the identity , since in this gauge we have @xmath92 , we can interpret the group elements @xmath77 as the ( edge ) holonomies associated to the leaves .",
    "let us now propose an inner product on the space @xmath98 .",
    "our choice for this inner product is motivated by the inductive limit hilbert space construction which will be carried out in the second main part of this work .",
    "as we will see , this construction requires to isometrically embed hilbert spaces based on coarser triangulations @xmath33 into hilbert spaces based on finer triangulations @xmath46 .",
    "recall that for a finer triangulation @xmath46 with @xmath99 , the associated manifold @xmath100 has more defects than the manifold @xmath62 , and the dual graph @xmath101 has more independent cycles than the dual graph @xmath34 .",
    "this means that the space @xmath102 of almost gauge - invariant holonomies is isomorphic to @xmath103 with @xmath104 .",
    "now , the coarser configuration space @xmath94 can be regained from the finer configuration space @xmath102 by imposing constraints @xmath105 ( where the index @xmath106 has range @xmath107 ) .",
    "these constraints impose that the `` finer '' holonomies , i.e. holonomies of cycles around the additional defects in @xmath100 , are trivial ( this will be explained in much more detail in section [ sec : refinement ] ) .",
    "the presence of these constraints means that states in the finer hilbert space @xmath108 which arise as the embedding of states in the coarser hilbert space @xmath109 are sharply peaked on vanishing `` finer '' holonomies .",
    "these states need to have a finite norm as otherwise the embedding would not be isometric ( and the inner product would not be cylindrically consistent , which would prevent the inductive limit construction of the continuum hilbert space from existing ) .",
    "furthermore , the motivation for this work is to construct a representation based on a vacuum state which is peaked on locally and globally flat connections , and this vacuum state should of course also have a finite norm .    if the gauge group @xmath1 is a finite group , the inner product provided by the discrete measure ( which agrees in this case with the haar measure ) leads to the required finiteness .",
    "however , if @xmath1 is a lie group ( even a compact one ) , the states of interest will have infinite norm .",
    "we therefore need to consider an appropriate regularization procedure .",
    "our regularization procedure goes as follows .",
    "first , we start with an auxiliary inner product @xmath110 , together with a family @xmath111 of regulator states having a finite norm with respect to this auxiliary inner product for finite @xmath112 .",
    "second , we need a family @xmath113 of regulator states approaching the ( locally and globally ) flat vacuum state @xmath114 when @xmath115 . with this , we can then define the inner product _ 1|_2=_0 .",
    "the use of such an inner product , which employs the vacuum state as a reference vector , was suggested already in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as we are going to show , it leads to a discrete mesure on the space of locally flat connections , which in turn will make the proof of cylindrical - consistency of the inner product rather simple to obtain .",
    "it is interesting to notice that other proposals using a non - discrete measure on the space of flat connections have appeared earlier in the literature @xcite , but so far do not allow for a clear understanding of the cylindrical - consistency properties of the inner product ( as opposed to the present framework ) @xcite .    to simplify the discussion ,",
    "let us now consider that the configuration space is given by a single copy of the ( compact and semi - simple ) gauge group @xmath1 , and choose the auxiliary inner product to be the one induced by the haar measure on @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , let us use a heat kernel regularization in order to regularize delta - peaked states . for @xmath116",
    ", we can then define @xmath112-regulated families of states converging to the delta function peaked on @xmath117 as _",
    "d_(-())_(g^-1 ) . here",
    "we have chosen representatives @xmath118 , given by representation matrices @xmath119 and with dimension @xmath120 , for the equivalence classes of unitary irreducible representations of @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath121 denotes the quadratic casimir ( the eigenvalue of the laplacian on the group manifold ) associated to the representation @xmath118 , and @xmath122 is the character of @xmath118 . since the representation matrices satisfy @xmath123 , we can readily compute = = . using the asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel on compact lie groups",
    "( see for instance @xcite ) , which takes the form ^_(g ) ( - ) , where @xmath124 is the geodesic distance in @xmath1 between @xmath125 and the unit element @xmath126 , we finally get the following limit of vanishing regulator for the inner product : [ limitip ]  ( , ) , here @xmath127 if and only if @xmath128 and is vanishing otherwise .",
    "this delta symbol should therefore be treated as a kronecker delta with continuous parameters .",
    "this is similar to what happens in the case of the bohr compactification of abelian groups , in particular for example in loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite .",
    "however , in lqc the bohr compactification typically corresponds to the configuration space ( i.e. to the holonomies , which are proportional to the momentum @xmath129 conjugate to the scale factor @xmath130 ) , whereas here , in the case of the abelian group @xmath131 , we are compactifying the dual group @xmath132 ( i.e. the space of fluxes ) , which in turn leads to a discrete topology on @xmath131 itself .",
    "let us now turn to the basis states for the hilbert space @xmath95 . introducing the collection @xmath133 of group elements , the basis states @xmath134 are of the form [ basisvectors ] _",
    "\\{_}\\{g _ } = _ ( _ , g _ ) , and are orthonormal in the above - introduced inner product : [ eq : hsinnerproduct ] _ \\{_}|_\\{_}= _",
    "( _ , _ ) .",
    "note that the hilbert space @xmath95 , although being associated to a finite triangulation , is therefore non - separable .",
    "more precisely , the hilbert space is the closure of states of the form \\{g _ } = _ \\{_}f\\{_}_\\{_}\\{g _ } , where the sum runs over a _",
    "finite _ set of values @xmath135 and @xmath136 is a function on this finite set .",
    "although we are here developing a flux formulation of lqg , it is worth noticing that we work still in the holonomy representation for the arguments of the wave functions . in appendix [",
    "appendix : spin ] , we introduce a dual spin representation based on a suitable discrete generalization of the ( group ) fourier transform .",
    "this spin representation can also be used to express the measure functional , as explained in appendix [ appendix : spin ] .",
    "the construction which we have carried out so far depends on a specific choice of maximal tree @xmath49 with ( fixed ) root node @xmath42 .",
    "however , it is not difficult to see that the inner product is independent of the choice of tree , which means that the construction of @xmath95 is also independent of this choice .    in order to see this explicitly ,",
    "let us choose another tree @xmath137 in @xmath34 with the same root @xmath42 .",
    "the trees @xmath49 and @xmath137 define two different isomorphisms between @xmath94 and @xmath78 , which means that the same connection in @xmath94 corresponds to two different sets @xmath138 and @xmath139 of group elements .",
    "the explicit isomorphism between the two sets of group elements can be constructed as follows . for both sets @xmath53 and @xmath140 of leaves , the corresponding sets @xmath141 and @xmath142 of cycles are fundamental .",
    "therefore , a given cycle @xmath54 can be expressed as a word in the cycles @xmath142 ( and their inverses ) , and the other way around , where the orientation ( and ordering ) of @xmath54 in the product is according to the orientation ( and ordering ) in which the leaves @xmath51 appear in @xmath143 . ] .",
    "we denote these relations by _",

    "= w_\\{_}. because of this , the corresponding group holonomies for the same flat connection in @xmath94 can therefore be expressed as [ eq : isomorphism ] g_=w_\\{g_},g _",
    "= w_\\{g_}.    let us now consider a state @xmath144 in the representation based on the choice of tree @xmath49 .",
    "a change of tree @xmath145 induces a gauge transformation @xmath146 of the function @xmath147 on @xmath78 , which we denote by @xmath148 . the gauge - transformed state is then given by \\{g _ } = ( ) \\{g _ } = \\{w_\\{g_}}. in particular , for the basis states @xmath134 we have that ( _ \\{_})\\{g _ } = _ \\{_}\\{w_\\ { g _ } } = _ ( _ , w_\\{g _ } ) = _ ( w_\\{_},g _ )",
    "= _ \\{w_\\{_}}\\{g_}. here we have used the fact that the words @xmath149 ( or their inverses @xmath150 ) define a bijective map @xmath151 , which means that @xmath152 if and only if @xmath153 .    with these ingredients , we can finally compute the inner product using the representation based on the choice of tree @xmath137 , which leads to ( _ \\{_})|(_\\{_})=_\\{w_\\{_}}|_\\{w_\\{_}}= _ ( _ , _ ) .",
    "this is identical to the inner product between states expressed with respect to the choice of tree @xmath49 , which shows that the inner product is independent from the choice of tree , or in other words invariant under gauge transformations not acting at the root .",
    "we are now going to deal with these residual gauge transformations .      the states in @xmath154 which we have constructed correspond to states on almost gauge - invariant connections @xmath94 .",

    "now that we have introduced the hilbert space , the inner product , and a basis of states on a fixed triangulation , we are ready to discuss the quantization of the algebra of holonomy - flux observables .",
    "this will then enable us to discuss , in the next section , the construction of the area operator and the associated notion of quantum geometry .",
    "in the previous section , we have focused on the configuration space of connections associated to a triangulation . in order to obtain the phase space of lqg , we need to supplement the holonomies encoding the connection degrees of freedom with their conjugated fluxes of the electric field .",
    "this will allow us to discuss in which sense the quantum operators which we are going to define provide a representation of the holonomy - flux algebra .    as discussed in @xcite , the finite - dimensional ( almost ) gauge - invariant phase space @xmath169 associated to a triangulation @xmath33",
    "is spanned by cycle holonomies @xmath77 and rooted fluxes @xmath170 associated to the leaves .",
    "these variables , which form the rooted holonomy - flux algebra @xmath171 , are defined as @xmath172 and @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the holonomy along the tree going from the root to the source node of the leaf @xmath51 .",

    "the gauge - covariant phase space is parametrized by holonomies @xmath81 and fluxes @xmath185 associated to all the links of the graph , and the poisson structure is that of @xmath186 . by choosing a tree , one can gauge - fix all the branch holonomies to be @xmath187 .",
    "the associated dirac brackets , involving @xmath181 and @xmath175 only , do then agree with the poisson brackets and lead again to the poisson structure on @xmath179 .    since we are working in the connection representation , we can expect that the holonomies will be quantized as multiplication operators and the conjugated fluxes as derivative operators .",
    "while it is true that the holonomies will act by multiplication , the fluxes can however not be realized as derivative operators .",
    "this is due to the peculiar hilbert space topology which we have chosen in order to accommodate the flat state as a normalizable state an to allow for the construction of an inductive limit hilbert space .",
    "states in this hilbert space , seen as functions on @xmath78 , are generically not continuous .",
    "this effect is analogous to what happens in lqc due to the bohr compactification of the configuration space ( remember however , from the discussion of section [ overview ] , the difference between lqc and the construction based on the bf vacuum presented here ) . the way around this difficulty is to introduce exponentiated derivative operators , or , in other words , translations .",
    "indeed , we are going to see that the quantized exponentiated fluxes act as left or right translations on the appropriate copy of the group .",
    "in addition to considering the exponentiated version of an elementary flux variable , we will also have to discuss the action of exponentiated parallel - transported fluxes .",
    "it turns out that the parallel transport will appear as an adjoint action of certain holonomies on the group element parametrizing the translation .    to be more precise",
    ", the exponentiation of the fluxes is to be understood as exponentiating the symplectic flow generated by the fluxes . indeed ,",
    "if one sees the fluxes as representing vector fields ( acting as derivatives ) on the phase space ( see for instance @xcite ) , the exponentiated fluxes correspond to integrating these vector fields to a finite flow .",
    "let us illustrate this for one copy of the group .",
    "the symplectic flow induced by an elementary flux @xmath185 associated to a link @xmath82 is given by [ flux1 ] ( _ ix^i_l,)f(h_l ) _",
    "k\\{_ix^i_l , f(h_l)}_k = r_l^(_i^i)f(h_l ) f(h_l(_i^i ) ) , where the iterated poisson brackets are defined by @xmath188 and @xmath189 . for the link with a reversed orientation , we have that ( _ ix^i_l^-1,)f(h_l ) r_l^-1^(_i^i)f(h_l ) = l_l^(_i^i)f(h_l ) = f((-_i^i)h_l ) . in an abuse of notation",
    ", we will denote the group element parametrizing this flow by @xmath190 .",
    "so far we have considered the flow induced by an elementary flux which is not parallel - transported .",
    "note that if we understand this description as arising from a gauge - fixing , then the flux @xmath175 in the gauge - fixed version does indeed correspond to the rooted ( parallel - transported along the tree ) flux @xmath170 .",
    "hence , the ( exponentiated ) action of @xmath175 on @xmath181 agrees with the ( exponentiated ) action of @xmath170 on the cycle holonomy @xmath77",
    ".    we might however encounter further parallel transport for the fluxes , not necessary along the tree . in the almost gauge - invariant description",
    ", such a parallel transport will be along a closed loop @xmath48 , and will appear through the adjoint action of a product @xmath191 of cycle holonomies @xmath192 , which in the gauge - fixed description is just given by the corresponding product @xmath193 of leaf holonomies @xmath194 .",
    "let us assume for now that @xmath181 is not appearing in this product .",
    "we then have for the symplectic flow generated by @xmath195 the following action : ( _ i\\{h^-1_x^i_h_,})f(h _ ) = f(h_h_h_^-1 ) . if @xmath193 includes a leaf holonomy @xmath181 ( such that it can not be reduced by using the inversion formula @xmath196 ) the evaluation of the flow does become very involved ( since the flux @xmath175 is meeting in the iterated poisson brackets the element @xmath181 in the parallel transport ) .",
    "we will exclude this case and not allow such a parallel transports to happen .    in summary , we are going to quantize the parallel - transported fluxes @xmath197 in their exponentiated form as parallel - transported ( right ) translations , i.e. g_^-1_g _",
    "r_^g_g_^-1 , and the parallel - transported fluxes associated to inverted links as left translations , i.e. g_^-1_^-1 g _  l_^g_g_^-1 . in all cases ,",
    "we assume that the parallel transport @xmath191 does not contain the holonomy @xmath181 ( except in the case that the right translation can be rewritten into a left one and vice versa ) .",
    "note that although a representation of the fluxes as derivative operators is not available , it is still possible to approximate derivative operators in terms of translations generated by the exponentiated fluxes .",
    "this is what we will use in the next section in order to discuss the area operator .",
    "we have here considered only the fluxes associated to the leaves .",
    "it is however possible to reconstruct the fluxes associated to the branches starting from the ones associated to the leaves by solving the gau  constraints .",
    "the corresponding translation operators are then products of translation operators associated to the leaves .",
    "this construction is explained in appendix [ appendix : branchx ] .",
    "let us consider the space @xmath198 of continuous functions @xmath199 over @xmath79 copies of the gauge group .",
    "being continuous functions on a compact space , these functions are bounded , and in the holonomy representation the holonomy operators acting as multiplication of states by elements of @xmath198 are therefore bounded operators . examples of such functions are matrix elements @xmath200 for a unitary irreducible representation @xmath118 .",
    "although states of the form @xmath201 are not normalizable in our inner product ( if @xmath1 is not a finite group ) , such functions are allowed to be used as multiplication operators , i.e. lead to densely defined operators .",
    "another example is given by functions of the form f\\{g _ } = _ if_i_(g_,^(i ) _ ) , where the index @xmath202 runs over a finite set , and @xmath203 is the @xmath51-th entry in the @xmath202-th element @xmath204 of a finite subset of @xmath78 .",
    "again , we denote by @xmath205 the kronecker delta as defined below equation .    the action of an holonomy operator on a state in @xmath95 is given by [ holop1 ] \\{g _ } = f\\{g_}\\{g_}. the holonomy operators are straightforward to diagonalize , and the eigenvectors agree with the basis vectors @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , such an operator has a discrete spectrum given by the image of @xmath206 in @xmath207 ( or in @xmath9 if one takes the real or imaginary parts of @xmath206 ) .",
    "note that the spectrum can appear as continuous , but always comes equipped with a discrete spectral measure .",
    "as discussed in the beginning of this section , we do not quantize the fluxes themselves , but rather their exponentiated version , which leads to an action as right translation operators . to the flux associated to the @xmath202-th leaf @xmath208 we associate the operator r__i^\\{g _ } = ( g_1,  ,g_i,  ,g_|| ) .",
    "a ( first order ) difference operator can then be defined as d^__i ( r__i^-r__i^^-1 ) , with @xmath209 denoting the geodesic distance in @xmath1 between @xmath210 and @xmath126 .",
    "the translation operators are isometric since the discrete measure employed for the inner product on @xmath95 is invariant under translations .",
    "they are also invertible , i.e. ( r_^)^-1 = ( r_^)^=r_^^-1 , and therefore unitary .",
    "it is quite instructive to discuss the spectrum of such a translation operator , and to compare it to the spectrum of a flux operator in the al representation",
    ". this will be the focus of the next subsection .",

    "what actually matters is rather the fineness of the triangulation @xmath267 as compared to the fineness of the states onto which the area operator is applied .",
    "+ since one can choose @xmath267 to be much coarser than the triangulations underlying the states , the bf - based representation provides a natural way of defining coarse - grained geometric quantities .",
    "this possibility does a priori not exist in the al representation , which leads to problems when trying to construct suitable semi - classical states approximating smooth geometries ( see for instance the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "+ because of its behavior under refinement operations , the area operator introduced here is similar to the one proposed by livine and terno in @xcite .",
    "this latter is an alternative to the usual area operator in the al hilbert space @xcite .",
    "the usual area operator @xcite involves a sum over the casimir operators for each spin network edge piercing the surface . under refinement of the states ,",
    "the sum is extended in order to include the casimir operators associated to the additional edges .",
    "the alternative suggestion made in @xcite is to first couple the representation spaces associated to the spin network edges going through a piece of surface ( which here is defined to be a triangle in @xmath267 ) to a total angular momentum vector space .",
    "one should then considers the @xmath2 casimir with respect to this total angular momentum .",
    "therefore , under refinement one still considers just one casimir operator , but now for a different total angular momentum vector space arising from more recoupling steps . + the difference with our new proposal is that here we have to replace the angular momentum operators with exponentiated operators ( due to the compactification of the lie algebra of @xmath2 ) , while the behavior under refinement of states is similar .",
    "indeed the cylindrical - consistency of the area operator ( i.e. its consistent behavior under refinement ) in the bf - based representation is ensured by the recoupling prescription .",

    "this parallel transport takes place along a surface tree ( defined in detail in @xcite ) , which is as close to the surface as possible ( and below the oriented surface ) .",

    "* with the definition(s ) of @xmath285 discussed above , we can write down a consistent area operator which can be applied to states based on different triangulations .",
    "consistency means that the area operator will give the same result for states connected by the refinement operations which we define in section [ sec : refinement ] .",
    "this allows for the area operator to be defined on a continuum ( inductive limit ) hilbert space .",
    "+ given a triangulation @xmath33 supporting @xmath267 or @xmath286 , we need to specify the parallel transport for the definition of the fluxes @xmath285 .",

    "however , the extension to states defined on triangulations @xmath46 finer than @xmath33 is less trivial .",
    "the basic problem is to define a notion of parallel transport which leads to consistent results for arbitrary fine triangulations .",

    "however the essential features do not change : using the intertwiner - spin representation laid out in appendix [ intertwinerspin ] , one can couple the representation spaces associated to the finer links into a total spin @xmath11 .",
    "the discussion then proceeds as before , with the difference that one now has higher multiplicities for the eigenvalues caused by the recoupling procedure . as before ,",
    "the spectrum is bounded by @xmath334 .",
    "moreover , we have only considered so far the case of a basic triangle appearing in the triangulation of the surface @xmath266 underlying the definition of the area operator for this surface .",
    "these basic area operators will usually commute with each other . in order to obtain the spectrum of the full area operator , one needs to add up the ( square root ) of each of these contributions of the basic triangle ( squared ) area operators .",
    "the bound on the spectrum , which is given by @xmath334 , is therefore multiplied by the number of triangles appearing in the surface @xmath266 . although the basic area operators are bounded , we can achieve a large area by subdividing a given area in many pieces .",

    "let us emphasize that the compactification of the flux space , i.e. of the dual to the lie group , naturally leads to a compactification of the area spectrum for the area operator associated to a basic triangle .",
    "note that the subdivision of the surface @xmath266 is inherent to the definition of the are operator associated to this ( triangulated ) surface , and not to the triangulation on which the states are defined .",
    "therefore , by adding up the area operators associated to many triangles , we can increase the bound on the spectrum of the composed operator .",
    "furthermore , we have seen that it is possible to account for the barbero ",
    "immirzi parameter @xmath277 in two different ways , which does also influence the bound on the spectrum .",

    ", we can also diagonalize the area operator in the spin representation .",
    "these are indeed proper eigenvalues if one introduces a cutoff hilbert space which only admits spins smaller than or equal to @xmath317 .",
    "however , it is not clear how the spectrum changes if the cutoff is removed .",
    "the spectrum associated to small spins @xmath11 ( and sufficiently small @xmath8 ) approximates the usual area spectrum @xmath336 quite well . for larger spin values @xmath11 ( or larger @xmath8 ) ,",
    "an oscillatory behavior appears .",
    "one can expect that this leads to a dense filling of at least a part of the space of allowed values .",
    "it will therefore be interesting to see what happens for the fully gauge - invariant area operator , which we now discuss .",
    "the lifting of the degeneracy of the eigenvalues in figure [ fig : area1 ] and figure [ fig : area2 ] is due to the non - invariance of the area operator under frame rotations ( i.e. gauge transformations ) at the root .",
    "let us therefore discuss possibilities for defining a fully gauge - invariant area operator .",
    "one possible starting point is to take the action of the area operator in the spin representation , and to consider the following ( normalized ) trace of the area operator : [ areag ] a^j _ ( ) = _ ma_mm^j ( ) = .",
    "if would give a well - defined operator ( on either the kinematical hilbert space or on the hilbert space of fully gauge - invariant wave functions ) , and also if we took the limit @xmath337 , we could read off the spectrum from the representation in . there",

    ", we can consider the ( kernel of the ) operator in the holonomy representation , namely ( a_^)(h ) = _",
    "( h)a^_(h,h)(h ) , with [ akernel ] a^_(h,h ) & = _ _ jd_j_j(hh^-1)a^j _ ( ) + & = ( h,h)-__j_j((hh^-1))_j ( ( ) ) , where @xmath339 , and @xmath340 $ ] is the class angle of the group element @xmath117 .",
    "the sum in the second term gives the ( dirac ) delta function ( without the factor of @xmath341 ) on the equivalence classes of the adjoint action , i.e. [ suml ] _",
    "j/2_j()_j ( ) = _ ( g)(g^-1g^-1 ) , and one could in principle interpret the area operator as a translation operator acting on these equivalence classes .",

    "j_j ( ) _ j ( ) ~\\ {    cl & , + ^3 &    .",
    "because of this , the kernel would be equal to the kronecker delta for @xmath343 ( since the second term is suppressed in the limit @xmath322 ) , but would be vanishing for @xmath344 .",
    "the expression does therefore not define a useful area operator on the kinematical hilbert space .",
    "nevertheless , it could be possible to define matrix elements in the inner product of the fully gauge - invariant hilbert space , as defined in section [ sec : raq ] , via the raq procedure .",
    "this would lead to an averaging over the orbits of the adjoint action ( acting on the entry @xmath345 in ) with respect to the discrete measure on the group .",
    "the difficulty is however to exchange the sum and the limit in @xmath342 in with this discrete measure integral in a well - defined way .    in summary ,",
    "the derivation of a fully gauge - invariant area operator from the kinematical version is rather involved ( this difficulty is however lifted if one changes to a quantum group at root of unity , as will be discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] ) . an alternative way to proceed",
    "is offered by the interpretation of the kernel with respect to the continuous topology : it would then define a translation operator for the class angle .",
    "indeed , the usual area operator is given as a laplace operator on the group if we work with @xmath346 .",
    "we could therefore consider the laplace operator restricted to class functions , which is [ lap ] = _",
    "( ^2 _ ) , and approximate this differential operator by a difference operator .",

    "let us therefore study how the translation operators @xmath347 , which are instrumental for the area operator on the kinematical hilbert space , act on the class angle of the argument @xmath125 being translated in the wave function .",

    ", the class angle of the product @xmath351 is given by [ classa ] ( g_i^ ) = ( ( g)((g))_i(g ) ) .",
    "the problem is now that this class angle depends through @xmath349 on the full group element @xmath125 , and not only on its class angle .",
    "to get rid of this dependency , we can integrate over @xmath161 the adjoint action @xmath352 , which happens to be equal to a rotation of the vector @xmath349 over the sphere @xmath353 .",
    "this will lead to the same averaged class angles for the product of @xmath125 with @xmath354 and @xmath355 , and for all @xmath356 . with the parametrization n_1=,n_2=,n_3= , where @xmath218 and @xmath357 $ ] , the integration is easiest to perform for @xmath358 . choosing the normalized invariant measure on the sphere ,",

    "this ensures that the result is finite for @xmath360 ( and equal to @xmath361 ) and for @xmath362 ( and equal to @xmath363 ) , as can be seen on figure [ fig : theta1 ] .     between the translated and untranslated class angles , with translation parameter @xmath364 , as a function of the untranslated class angle @xmath365 .",

    "we can then define the square of the area operator as [ areainv1 ] _ ^_\\ { _ ,  } = -(_\\{r^(_),  }-_\\ { _ ,  } ) .",
    "we therefore have a translation operator acting on the class angle with a configuration - dependent translation parameter .",

    "it is certainly possibly to define alternative versions , for instance by discretizing the action of the laplacian on class functions .",
    "we now turn to the second main part of this work , which concerns the construction of the continuum inductive limit hilbert space . for this",
    ", we are going to introduce in section [ sec : refinement ] a few technical results concerning the refinement operations .",

    "then , this alternative path is going from the root @xmath42 to the source vertex @xmath576 of @xmath208 , and is given by t_r_i(0)w_\\{t_r_j(1)^-1l_jt_r_j(0)}. here @xmath577 is the path along the tree from the root @xmath42 to the source node of @xmath578 , and @xmath579 is the path along the tree from the root @xmath42 to the target node of @xmath578 .    in the refined triangulation , @xmath572 provides in the same way alternative paths for the parallel transports of the fluxes @xmath580 . for a fixed @xmath581 ,",
    "the path starts at the root @xmath439 and ends at @xmath582 .",
    "it is given by t_r(0)w_\\{t_r_j(1)^-1l_jt_r_j(0)}. likewise , if @xmath583 , the path ends at @xmath584 , and is given by t_r(1)w_\\{t_r_j(1)^-1l_jt_r_j(0)}.    again , one can also choose alternative extensions for the parallel - transported translation operators @xmath585 , in particular by changing the parallel transports @xmath572 .",
    "for each @xmath580 , one can replace @xmath572 with a ( @xmath397-dependent ) transport along an homotopy - equivalent ( in @xmath62 ) path to @xmath48 .",
    "as before , in order to avoid ordering issues , one can demand that these new paths should not include any @xmath580 .",
    "this condition can be weakened in a similar way as discussed previously for the translation operators .",
    "in the previous section , we have discussed extensions of operators on a given triangulation @xmath33 to a refined triangulation @xmath46 .",
    "this allows to define a consistent family of operators given on a sequence @xmath586 of finer and finer triangulations . by taking the operator on a very fine triangulation @xmath587 in this sequence",
    ", it is also possible to extend this consistent family to all triangulations coarser than @xmath587 . for this",
    ", we just have to first refine states from the coarser triangulation to @xmath587 , and then apply the operator @xmath588 to such states .",
    "this can be repeated with an even finer triangulation @xmath589 , which then gives a consistent definition on all triangulations which are coarser than @xmath590 ( agreeing with the previous definition on triangulations where it has already been defined ) .",
    "however , there is no guarantee that starting with an operator @xmath532 and then extending this operator to @xmath46 and @xmath517 independently will give a definition which agrees on a triangulation that can arise as coarse - graining of @xmath46 and @xmath517 respectively .",
    "the challenge is therefore to extend a given observable @xmath532 to all triangulations at once in a consistent way .",
    "let us first discuss one possibility which does lead to a consistent family of observables , but however _ not _ to a continuum observable in the usual sense ( although it can be defined on the inductive limit hilbert space @xmath367 ) .",
    "given @xmath591 on @xmath592 we define extensions to any finer @xmath108 by [ nullextension ] ( _ _ 0)_ ( _ _ 0)_i(_i , ) , where @xmath535 are the ( coarse - graining ) constraints describing states in @xmath108 which arise as refinements from @xmath592 . here",
    "@xmath593 is any of the allowed extensions of @xmath591 to @xmath46 . it does not matter which extension one chooses , since the operator @xmath594 is only non - vanishing on states which arise as refinements of @xmath595 .",
    "the actions of different extensions @xmath593 do agree on such states .",
    "we can also define @xmath596 for any @xmath33 which is not a refinement of @xmath595 , by first refining a state in @xmath95 to a common refinement of @xmath595 and @xmath33 , and then applying the prescription .",
    "the family @xmath594 of observables constructed in this way satisfies the cylindrical - consistency conditions .",
    "it therefore defines an operator on the inductive limit hilbert space @xmath367 .",
    "the observables do however vanish on any state which is not cylindrical over @xmath595 ( i.e. which is not a refinement of a state in @xmath592 ) .",
    "such operators do therefore not correspond to quantizations of `` continuum '' flux and holonomy functions .",
    "the classical version they correspond to are rather such functions multiplied with a ( infinite ) product of delta functions imposing that curvature is vanishing almost everywhere .",
    "let us emphasize again that , nevertheless , the observables are well defined .",
    "likewise , their spectrum has a well defined meaning .",
    "this holds in particular with respect to the interpretation of the inductive hilbert space construction as corresponding classically to a symplectic reduction @xcite .",
    "that is , the spectrum of @xmath532 coincides with the spectrum of @xmath597 restricted to the subspace of states which are cylindrical over @xmath33 .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath594 is given by @xmath598 .",
    "this leaves us with the question of whether one can construct quantum observables on @xmath367 which would actually correspond to quantizations of continuum versions of flux and holonomy observables .",
    "let us sketch such a construction here , starting with an holonomy operator .      to discuss the holonomy operator",
    ", we will assume that the path @xmath48 underlying the holonomy is piecewise - geodesic in the auxiliary metric on @xmath13 .",
    "the holonomy operator is unambiguously defined on a triangulation @xmath33 if the underlying path is a path in the inside of the manifold @xmath62 , i.e. if it avoids the defects of this manifold .",
    "we call the set of triangulations @xmath33 on which this is the case @xmath599 .",
    "this is itself a partially - ordered directed set , and the corresponding inductive limit hilbert space gives a subspace @xmath600 of the full inductive limit hilbert space @xmath367 .",
    "the holonomy operator can unambiguously be defined on this subspace .    in the case",
    "in which the path @xmath48 does hit the boundary of @xmath62 one needs to choose a regularization of the operator ( or rather of the underlying path ) .",
    "any such choice of regularization corresponds to an extension of an operator from @xmath601 to a bigger subspace .",
    "such extensions of a ( bounded ) operator from @xmath600 to a ( bounded ) operator @xmath367 always exist , but they are in general not unique .      for the translation operator ( or the parallel - transported translation operator ) , the main issue is again to unambiguously define the paths underlying the parallel transports of the translation operators associated to the finer links .    in particular , for the notion of integrated flux over a surface @xmath266 ( in @xmath16 spatial dimensions )",
    ", we have to specify a parallel transport for all points on this surface to , e.g. , a surface root .",
    "the complicated case is here @xmath16 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath15 there is a canonical construction for the parallel transport of the fluxes , which are integrated along a one - dimensional `` shadow graph '' as explained in @xcite . for the following discussion ,",
    "we therefore restrict ourselves to @xmath16 , and furthermore assume that the auxiliary metric is flat , so that the notion of piecewise - geodesic reduces to that of piecewise - linear .",
    "let us consider the integrated flux observables associated to a surface @xmath266 , which is itself piecewise - linear and more precisely comes from the gluing of ( flat ) triangular surfaces @xmath268 .",
    "the continuum parallel transport for this surface is specified as follows .",
    "first , this parallel transport is required to take place in the surface @xmath602 which is infinitesimally shifted below @xmath266 ( with respect to the orientation of @xmath266 ) .",
    "second , we choose in each triangle @xmath268 of @xmath266 an inner reference point @xmath603 , referred - to as a @xmath268-root , to which all the inside points of @xmath268 are parallel - transported along geodesics ( which are here straight lines ) . finally , we choose a tree , referred - to as an @xmath266-tree , in the graph dual to the triangulation of @xmath266 .",
    "the root of this @xmath266-tree should agree with that of the @xmath268-roots @xmath604 .",
    "furthermore , the tree should connect the remaining @xmath268-roots @xmath603 to @xmath604 as follows : the nodes @xmath603 of two neighboring triangles are connected by a geodesic restricted to @xmath602 , i.e. a possibly kinked line in the @xmath16 flat space , and a straight line if considered from the induced ( flat ) metric of the two triangles .",
    "this description defines the parallel transport for the continuum observable .",
    "we now have to construct a projection of this parallel transport to a given triangulation @xmath33 .",
    "this triangulation should be sufficiently fine in order to support the surface @xmath266 , i.e. the triangular surfaces @xmath268 are unions of two - dimensional simplices @xmath605 of @xmath33 .",
    "consider the cut of the surface @xmath602 with the triangulation @xmath33 . by shifting @xmath266",
    "infinitesimally to @xmath602 , we avoid the potential curvature singularities ( which in @xmath16 are along line defects ) along the edges of the triangulation @xmath33 ( remember that we also assume that the edges of the triangulation are geodesics , i.e. straight lines , and that the triangles of the triangulation are minimal surfaces , i.e. flat ) .",
    "the edges of @xmath602 might now be `` thickened '' , since it could happen that more than two ( downside ) tetrahedra hinge on a given edge of @xmath266 .",
    "we can however ignore this thickening since the path of the parallel transport across these additional tetrahedra is unambiguous .",
    "what needs to be clarified is the path for the parallel transport across the two - dimensional triangulation of @xmath266 which is induced by @xmath33 .",
    "this induced triangulation @xmath606 of @xmath266 will be a refinement of the original triangulation of @xmath266 into triangles @xmath268 , as shown on figure [ fig : subdivision ] .",
    "we have to specify the parallel transport paths on @xmath607 , where @xmath608 denotes the vertices of @xmath606 .",
    "we assume that the triangulation @xmath33 is such that none of the @xmath268-roots @xmath603 coincide with a vertex of the induced triangulation or lies on an edge of this induced triangulation .",
    "we furthermore assume that the vertices of @xmath608 do not touch any of the paths along the @xmath266-tree .",
    "therefore , we are just left with the task of specifying the tree for the parallel transport inside a given triangle @xmath268 .",
    "we construct the parallel transport on @xmath609 as follows .",
    "since the @xmath268-root @xmath603 lies in the inside of one of the induced triangles @xmath605 , the parallel transport for a point @xmath242 of this triangle @xmath610 to @xmath603 is therefore uniquely specified along the geodesic from @xmath242 to @xmath603 .",
    "let us consider some other induced triangle @xmath611 of @xmath268 .",
    "then we can have the following two cases :    1 .",
    "the parallel transports along straight lines of all the points in @xmath611 are homotopy - equivalent in @xmath607 .",
    "this means that for any two points @xmath612 and @xmath613 lying inside this induced triangle , the piecewise - geodesic path from @xmath603 to @xmath612 , then to @xmath613 , and back to @xmath603 , is homotopy - equivalent to the trivial cycle .",
    "we can then choose any of the inside points @xmath242 , and adopt as a parallel transport for all points of this triangle a representative path which crosses through all the triangles which are crossed by the path from @xmath242 to @xmath603 .",
    "there are points @xmath612 and @xmath613 of the inside of the induced triangle for which the piecewise geodesic path from @xmath603 to @xmath612 , then to @xmath613 , and back to @xmath603 , is not homotopy - equivalent ( in @xmath609 ) to the trivial cycle . in this case",
    ", we have to subdivide the triangulation @xmath33 further , until this situation eventually does not appear ( now with respect to @xmath614 ) .    to see that this procedure does indeed stabilize after a finite number of steps ( and does not produce further and further subdivisions ) , consider the example of figure [ fig : subdivision ] .",
    "there , we construct the subdivision of @xmath268 into regions which are homotopy - equivalently transported to @xmath603 . to this end , we need to draw straight lines ( appearing as dashed lines in the middle panel of figure [ fig : subdivision ] ) from the @xmath268-root @xmath603 to all the vertices @xmath608 , and continue these lines until they hit the boundary of @xmath268 .",
    "we can ignore the parts of the lines which lie in @xmath610 ( which are in dashed green in figure [ fig : subdivision ] ) .",
    "the remaining parts of the lines ( in dashed red ) will subdivide the other triangles @xmath611 into homotopy - equivalent regions .",
    "we then need to subdivide the triangulation further , until these regions are unions of triangles @xmath615 of the refined triangulation .",
    "this introduces the finely dashed red line in the middle panel of figure [ fig : subdivision ] .",
    "however , note that the lines emanating from @xmath603 do not cross themselves , and therefore only form new vertices with the edges which are already subdividing the triangle @xmath268 ( this is the vertex @xmath616 in the middle panel ) .",
    "these new vertices can in principle refine the notion of homotopy - equivalent regions , which would then require an iteration of the procedure .",
    "all the new vertices are however exactly on the boundary of the homotopy - equivalent regions which have just been defined .",
    "therefore , an iteration of this procedure is not necessary .",
    "we now have a triangulation of @xmath268 which is such that any two points in the inside of any given triangle are homotopy - equivalent as far as the transport to @xmath603 is concerned .",
    "this allows to define a sub - tree , which specifies the parallel transport for the triangle @xmath268 itself ( see the right panel of figure [ fig : subdivision ] ) . as a last step",
    ", one needs to find a refined triangulation @xmath46 of @xmath13 which induces a triangulation of @xmath268 that coincides with the one we have just constructed .     and",
    "its induced subdivision by a triangulation @xmath33 .",
    "the vertices @xmath617 and @xmath618 lead to a further subdivision into homotopy - equivalent regions with respect to the transport to @xmath603 , which is shown in the middle panel .",
    "this subdivision is completed to a triangulation of @xmath268 , and therefore the triangulation @xmath33 of @xmath13 needs to be refined to a triangulation @xmath46 such that the induced triangulation for @xmath268 coincides with the one in the middle panel .",
    "the right panel shows the ( surface ) tree for the parallel transport in the triangulation @xmath46 . ]    in summary , if the above assumptions are satisfied , we will eventually be able to define the parallel transport on a possibly refined triangulation @xmath46 , which is required in order to specify the translation operator ( on @xmath108 ) .",
    "we can also apply this translation operator to states in @xmath95 since we just need to refine these states to @xmath46 .    the discussion on alternative extensions to @xmath46 for a given translation operator defined on a triangulation @xmath33 in section [ extflux ] included in particular the change of parallel transport .",
    "therefore , we can adjust the parallel transport of a given extension to @xmath46 so that it matches the one given by the projection of the continuum translation operator .",
    "consider the ( integrated ) flux associated to a fixed choice of a triangulated surface @xmath266 , a choice of @xmath268-roots , and a choice of @xmath266-surface tree . to define the corresponding translation operator on the continuum hilbert space , we first consider a partially - ordered subset of triangulations such that the assumptions regarding the reconstruction of an unambiguous parallel transport are satisfied for each of the triangulations in this subset .",
    "we can then argue in a similar manner as for the holonomy operators , and define an integrated translation operator on the corresponding subspace of @xmath367 .",
    "extensions of this operator always exist , but are again not unique .",
    "we therefore obtain continuum operators which are quantizing the holonomies and ( the exponentiated flow of the ) fluxes .",
    "this allows to consider the ( weyl form of ) the holonomy - flux algebra , or more precisely its commutation relations . due to the cylindrical - consistency of the operators",
    ", one can evaluate the commutators between two operators on a triangulation @xmath33 on which both operators can be unambiguously defined .",
    "due to our quantization prescription , one then obtains the expected result for the commutators between holonomies and translation operators .",
    "in @xcite , we have also evaluated the poisson algebra of the fluxes explicitly .",
    "note that this can not be performed in the al framework , since there the poisson bracket of two fluxes might lead to a more singular object , e.g. a flux only smeared over a one - dimensional path in @xmath16 spatial dimensions .",
    "in contrast , in @xcite one obtains again ( parallel - transported ) fluxes smeared over @xmath31-dimensional surfaces as a result of the commutator between two fluxes .",
    "the reason is that the main contribution to the commutators arises from the parallel transport and the basic fluxes .",
    "therefore , all the parallel transport holonomies for a certain ( @xmath31-dimensional ) part of the flux surface contribute to the commutator .",
    "the result of the commutator is therefore a flux which is smeared over this part of the surface ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the complete consideration of these commutators requires to go through many separate cases , and we therefore leave the consideration of the quantum commutators for future work .",
    "we have constructed in this paper a new realization of quantum geometry .",
    "our construction being based on the holonomy and flux variables of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) , it shares some features with the already existing ashtekar ",
    "lewandowski ( al ) representation , but , most importantly , exhibits crucial differences .",
    "first of all , both the al and the bf representations provide a concrete realization of the idea of seeing ( quantum ) gravity as a topological field theory with defects . however , while in the al representation the defects are the carriers of the geometrical excitations themselves , which leads to complications when trying to construct semi - classical smooth geometries , in the bf representation the situation is reversed .",
    "indeed , as we have seen , the bf representation is based on a vacuum peaked on locally and globally flat connections , and excitations on top of this vacuum are carried by defects encoding non - trivial local curvature ( while the conjugated intrinsic geometry is maximally uncertain ) .",
    "second , the construction of the bf representation relies on the triangulation of the spatial manifold itself , and does not consider the ( arbitrary ) dual graphs as fundamental structures , as it is the case in the al representation . because of this , the notion of refinement and embedding of dual graphs in the al representation is replaced here by the refinement of triangulations and the associated notion of embedding of coarser triangulations into finer ones . this notion of embedding is crucial for the construction of a continuum inductive limit hilbert space .",
    "as recalled in the introduction , a fundamental result of lqg , which is based on the al representation , is the existence of a continuum inductive limit hilbert space which carries a unitary representation of the holonomy - flux algebra and of the action of spatial diffeomorphisms .",
    "we have shown here that this result can be extended to the bf representation as well , and that it is possible to construct an inductive limit hilbert space in which the hilbert spaces associated to triangulations carrying a finite number of curvature excitations are embedded .",
    "the existence of this continuum hilbert space relies on several key technical points .",
    "the most important one is that we need to work with exponentiated ( i.e. compactified ) fluxes , which is in turn equivalent to considering a discrete topology on the group labelling the curvature excitations .",
    "this is the reason why the bf representation evades the f  lost uniqueness theorem @xcite .",
    "indeed , this theorem states that the al representation is unique given a number of assumptions , and one of these is that the fluxes have to exist as well - defined operators .",
    "the introduction of a discrete topology on the group is one of the key features which leads to different properties for the geometric observables in the bf representation as compared to the al representation . in particular , the spectrum of the area operator , discussed in section [ sec : spectrumar ] ,",
    "is bounded in the bf representation . for the structure group @xmath131",
    ", the spectrum can be either discrete or continuous , depending on a parameter @xmath8 appearing in the definition of the area operator .",
    "we expect a similar result for the ( fully gauge - invariant ) @xmath2 area operator . furthermore , there are different possibilities to implement the presence of the barbero  immirzi parameter into the area operator , and it would be very interesting to see whether this parameter will continue to appear in the black hole entropy state counting , for which the area spectrum plays a crucial role @xcite .",
    "the fact that the spectra of the operators can be different in different representations emphasizes also the point raised in @xcite , namely that the spectra of physical observables on the physical hilbert space might be quite unrelated to the spectra of ( kinematical ) observables on kinematical hilbert spaces .",
    "further key differences between the al and bf representations are the different requirements for the behavior of operators under refinement . in the case of the bf representation",
    ", we can introduce for the geometric operators a measurement scale in the form of a subdivision of the region to be measured into a triangulation .",
    "this triangulation is attached to the operator and not the the state .",
    "therefore , the area of each triangle in such a triangulation is bounded .",
    "this still allows to achieve large areas by sufficiently subdividing a region into pieces .    it will be important to investigate how various results relying on the al representation will change if one works with the bf representation instead .",
    "for instance , the results of the black hole entropy calculation @xcite might change if one uses the bf representation . in this direction ,",
    "the work @xcite is interesting since it uses a kind of mixture between the bf and al representations in order to accommodate the isolated horizon constraints describing a certain family of black holes @xcite .",
    "the advantages of considering this new bf representation are manifold , and there are lots of interesting and important directions to be explored , as explained in the following points :    * the bf representation allows to have a nicer geometric interpretation since the states are not based anymore on degenerate spatial geometrical excitations .",
    "one should explore this interpretation in particular in @xmath619 spacetime dimensions , and its relation to simplicial geometry .",
    "since the classical phase space on a fixed triangulation agrees with that of loop quantum gravity on a fixed ( dual ) graph , one will find that the space of geometries , if interpreted in a simplicial manner , does not agree with regge geometries @xcite , but rather defines twisted geometries @xcite .",
    "however , the basis states are in fact not semi - classical , but rather squeezed states .",
    "in particular , the spatial geometrical operators have maximal uncertainties , whereas the curvature operators are maximally peaked .",
    "an interesting question is therefore to what extent the connection determines the four - dimensional geometry .",
    "note that the construction of such states with curvature line defects was also considered in @xcite . *",
    "the bf representation forces us to work with the gauge - covariant fluxes , i.e. the fluxes with parallel transport .",
    "this is intimately related to the behavior of the fluxes under refining and coarse - graining .",
    "it furthermore explains the effect of `` curvature - induced torsion '' @xcite , which can be ( easily ) understood as the fact that a curved triangle or curved tetrahedron does not satisfy the so - called closure constraints .",
    "this effect leads to a difficulty for coarse - graining , in the sense of mapping spin networks to coarser spin networks .",
    "as noted in @xcite , the coarse spin networks do not necessarily need to satisfy the coupling rules .",
    "however , this issue is largely connected to not providing a clean splitting of the observable algebra , as for instance used in @xcite for the case of the standard non - parallel - transported fluxes . here",
    ", we provided such a splitting in section [ splitting algebra ] , which allows for a clear geometric interpretation of coarse - graining in terms of which observables are kept and which are averaged over .",
    "this also answers the question raised in @xcite of how may quanta there are in a quantum spacetime : the phase space factor associated to the observables averaged over counts the number of quanta .",
    "* in @xmath620 spacetime dimensions , the bf representation constructed here shares many properties with the so - called combinatorial quantization scheme @xcite , which is based on the quantization of the space of flat connections on a manifold with defects . in this combinatorial approach ,",
    "the number of defects is fixed , so there is no need to invoke a continuum limit and therefore to use a bohr compactification like we do here .",
    "nevertheless , it would be interesting to construct an explicit maps between these approaches .",
    "reference @xcite already provides a map between the observable algebras .",
    "* since the roles of the holonomies and the fluxes are inverted as compared to the al representation , one can now work with the fluxes themselves , and therefore describe the coarse - graining of geometrical quantities .",
    "this would be a completion of the proposal @xcite to use a ( non - commutative ) flux representation for loop quantum gravity .",
    "in fact , in appendix [ appendix : spin ] , we discuss the spin representation and a non - commutative product ( which is basically the matrix product ) based on this representation .",
    "one needs this product in order to express the inner product of two states as a functional applied to the ( non - commutative ) product of these states .",
    "+ in this respect , it is also interesting to explore the full algebra of the exponentiated flux operators .",
    "in contrast , the full commutator algebra of the flux operators can not be described within the al representation since it would lead to fluxes smeared over singular surfaces in the case where the flux surfaces cut each other .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that in the case of the bf representation the classical poisson algebra of the fluxes is well - defined and does not lead to such an appearance of singular surfaces .",
    "* in this work , we have left largely open the question of how to impose the spatial diffeomorphism and the hamiltonian constraints .",
    "let us first comment on the spatial diffeomorphism constraints . here , we expect that spatial diffeomorphisms will act by moving the defects around , i.e. by changing the embedding of the triangulation network which supports the defects .",
    "this is basically the same action as in the al representation , and one would therefore use , as in the al representation , a group averaging procedure in order to define the ( spatially ) diffeomorphism invariant hilbert space . + in @xcite , we have provided a generator ( on phase space ) for this action in the case of @xmath620 spacetime dimensions . as part of the task of understanding the geometries encoded in the @xmath619-dimensional case",
    ", it would be important to investigate also this case .",
    "the question there is whether and how the diffeomorphism symmetry coincides with the bf translation symmetry .",
    "this is related to a proposal by zapata @xcite to construct a theory of topological gravity as a bf theory with certain broken symmetries .",
    "* let us now turn to the hamiltonian constraints .",
    "we do believe that hamiltonian constraint operators can in principle be constructed , since the main regularization mechanism pointed out in @xcite should also hold in our case .",
    "however , we expect that the problems with the constraint algebra @xcite will persist .",
    "this is ultimately related to the problem of preserving full diffeomorphism symmetry if lattices are introduced , even if this happens only on an auxiliary level @xcite .",
    "an advantage of the bf representation is however the nicer geometric interpretation , which can facilitate the discussion of these issues .",
    "the work @xcite is also aimed at understanding the dynamics of spin foam gravity as a continuum theory , starting from bf theory . + an alternative to directly imposing the hamiltonian constraints is to use a discrete time dynamics @xcite , and then to consider the continuum limit .",
    "this would in fact fully follow the philosophy of approximating the dynamics by using defects in a regge - like manner @xcite . a framework for describing a simplicial canonical dynamics has been described in @xcite .",
    "the question of how to reconstruct the continuum limit has been considered in e.g. @xcite . in this continuum limit , one can also hope to restore diffeomorphism symmetry as exemplified in @xcite .    the above points concern possible future work directions related to the bf representation . in addition , we believe that the techniques developed in this paper will also be helpful to construct further realizations of quantum geometry .",
    "any topological field theory whose defects support the holonomy - flux algebra ( or an alternative observable algebra ) can serve as a starting point for such a construction , as explained in @xcite .",
    "a main question for future research is therefore whether there exists any such topological field theories in the case of four spacetime dimensions .",
    "positive indications have been found in @xcite by studying the coarse - graining of ( simplified ) spin foam models , and work is in progress to find new topological field theories starting from spin foam models @xcite .",
    "again , there are a number of further directions to explore , including the following ones :    * a long standing problem has been that of constructing a hilbert space based on the structure group @xmath7 within the al representation .",
    "the main difficulty in trying to do so is the non - compactness of the group .",
    "even if one finds a way to appropriately compactify the group , there is the problem of how to construct an invariant measure . in the case of the bf representation ,",
    "we need to compactify instead the dual of the group , which leads to a discrete topology on the group itself .",
    "therefore , the advantage might be that there is an invariant discrete measure on the group which might allow to construct a bf - like representation for a non - compact gauge group .",

    "in this appendix , we briefly recall how the first fundamental group @xmath64 can be obtained in the case of two- and three - dimensional manifolds without defects .",
    "first , if @xmath13 is a closed and orientable riemann surface of genus @xmath125 , its fundamental group @xmath64 is given by the free group on @xmath621 generators @xmath622 , divided by a normal subgroup generated by the single relator @xmath623\\dots[a_g , b_g]$ ] , where the commutator is @xmath624=aba^{-1}b^{-1}$ ] .",
    "this can be shown by using the seifert ",
    "van kampen theorem to write @xmath625 , where @xmath626 is the bouquet obtained from the wedge sum of @xmath621 circles , and @xmath314 is the normal subgroup generated by @xmath627 . since this relator corresponds to a null - homotopic loop , we can write the presentation [ 2dpresentation ] _ 1 ( ) = a_1,b_1,  ,a_g , b_g|[a_1,b_1] ",
    "[a_g , b_g]=. notice that this first fundamental group , although always being finitely presented , is not free for @xmath628 .    for a three - dimensional compact , connected , and orientable manifolds @xmath13",
    ", the first fundamental group can also be finitely presented .",
    "this is most easily seen by using the fact that any such manifold admits a cw complex . indeed ,",
    "if we denote by @xmath629 the two - skeleton of the cw complex of @xmath13 , then we have that @xmath630 , which can in turn be computed using the seifert  van kampen theorem and the fact that @xmath629 is the union of the one - skeleton @xmath631 with all the two - cells of the cw complex .",
    "more precisely , @xmath632 is always given by a free group @xmath633 on @xmath634 generators , and the presentation of the first fundamental group of @xmath13 is given by _ 1 ( ) = a_1,  ,a_n_1|r_1,  ,r_n_2 , where the relator @xmath635 is the homotopy class in @xmath632 of the boundary of the @xmath202-th two - cell ( with @xmath636 ) , and therefore a word in the generators .",
    "this can equivalently be described in terms of the so - called spine of the manifold @xmath13 , which is a two - complex consisting of a single vertex , one - cells and two - cells .",
    "if the manifold @xmath13 is closed , its spine can be obtained by collapsing it after first removing an open three - ball . in this language , the generators are in one - to - one correspondence with the one - cells of the spine , the relators are in one - to - one correspondence with the two - cells , and the explicit expression for a relator @xmath635 describes how the @xmath202-th two - cell is attached to the one - skeleton .",
    "the case of the defected manifold @xmath71 is simpler to deal with than the case of a manifold without defects .",
    "this is due to the fact that the graph @xmath34 , which is the one - skeleton of the simplicial complex dual to the triangulation @xmath33 of @xmath13 , is a deformation - retract of @xmath71 . as a consequence ,",
    "their first fundamental groups are isomorphic , i.e. @xmath72 , which is in turn immediate to obtain .",
    "indeed , it is well - known that the first fundamental group of a graph is free and generated by @xmath637 generators corresponding to its fundamental cycles @xcite . by using a maximal spanning tree to characterize the fundamental cycles of the graph",
    ", we can therefore say that the first fundamental group of @xmath62 is freely generated by generators associated to the leaves of the tree .    for the sake of completeness ,",
    "let us comment on the counting of the number of generators for the first fundamental group in the case of a punctured riemann surface of arbitrary genus .",
    "any such surface with @xmath242 ( thickened ) punctures can be decomposed as a connected sum @xmath638 , where @xmath639 has genus @xmath640 and one puncture , while @xmath641 has genus one and @xmath642 punctures . in this decomposition , the surfaces @xmath639 and @xmath641 are glued along one common puncture ( so that the total number of punctures is indeed @xmath242 ) , and @xmath643 . by the seifer  van kampen theorem , we have that the first fundamental group of @xmath71 is given by the amalgamated free product [ freeproduct ] _",
    "1()_1(a)*__1(ab)_1(b ) = _ 1(a)*__1(^1)_1(b ) .",
    "each factor in this expression can easily be computed .",
    "first , for a surface of genus @xmath125 with a single puncture , the first fundamental group is isomorphic to that of a wedge sum of @xmath621 circles , so we can write that @xmath644 , which is the free group @xmath645 on @xmath646 generators .",
    "second , for a surface of genus one with @xmath242 punctures , the first fundamental group is isomorphic to that of a wedge sum of @xmath642 circles .",
    "this implies that @xmath647 , which is the free group on @xmath648 on @xmath649 generators .",
    "finally , we have that @xmath650 , which is the free group on a single generator . gathering these results",
    ", we get that the amalgamated free product defining @xmath70 is generated by the generators of @xmath651 and @xmath652 , with one generator removed due to @xmath653 .",
    "therefore , this leads to a free group on @xmath654 generators .",
    "this result is consistent with the usual presentation which generalizes to the case of punctured surfaces and takes the form [ punctured presentation ] _ 1 ( ) = a_1,b_1,  ,a_g , b_g , g_1,  ,g_p|[a_1,b_1]",

    ". this presentation is written in terms of @xmath621 generators corresponding to the non - contractible paths in @xmath71 , and the @xmath242 generators corresponding to the paths around the punctures .",
    "now , this presentation can be reduced by a so - called nielsen transformation which , since there is only one relation in the presentation , indeed leads to the free group on @xmath655 generator .",
    "now , since for triangulated surfaces the euler characteristic is given by @xmath656 , and since the punctures are `` piercing '' the faces ( which means that @xmath657 ) , we get that @xmath658 , which indeed corresponds to the number of leaves in a maximal spanning tree .",
    "we explain in this appendix how to reconstruct the fluxes ( and operators ) associated to the branches from the ones associated to the leaves . to this end",
    "we have to employ the gau  constraints branches and @xmath659 leaves .",

    ", we can go to the nodes which are only one step away from the end nodes along the tree . again , for every node there is only one unknown branch flux .",
    "one can then iterate this procedure and solve all the gau  constraints except for the one at the root .",
    "the fluxes associated to branches are then given by linear combinations of the fluxes associated to the leaves and to the inverse leaves .    to give the result of this procedure in a compact form ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath666 the set of end nodes of the tree which lie after the node @xmath667 when following the orientation of the tree .",

    "then we have that @xmath423 is also a refined tree for @xmath49 . _",
    "+ in order to prove this lemma , we need to show that the tree @xmath423 satisfies the properties @xmath406 and @xmath396 of definition [ def : refine - tree ] with respect to the tree @xmath49 .",
    "property @xmath406 follows from result of lemma [ lemma : ptransitivity ] , and from the fact that the trees @xmath389 and @xmath423 are refinements of @xmath49 and @xmath389 respectively .",
    "indeed , since @xmath740 and @xmath741 , by virtue of we also have that @xmath742 .    for property @xmath396",
    ", we have to show that any two nodes @xmath743 and @xmath744 , such that the dual simplices @xmath745 and @xmath746 are in @xmath747 for a fixed @xmath375 , can be connected by a path in @xmath423 without crossing the boundary @xmath748 .",
    "let @xmath749 be the simplex in @xmath46 containing the simplex @xmath745 dual to @xmath750 , i.e. such that @xmath751 , and likewise for @xmath752 .",
    "we have @xmath753 for @xmath754 .",
    "then the following two situations can occur :    1 .   if @xmath755 , the tree path from @xmath743 to @xmath744 is `` inside '' @xmath756 by virtue of property @xmath396 with respect to the pair @xmath757 of trees .",
    "therefore , this path does also not cross the boundary of @xmath747 , which shows that @xmath396 holds in this case also for the pair @xmath758 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath759 , the path from @xmath743 to @xmath744 along @xmath423 projects under @xmath381 to a path along the tree @xmath389 , which is from the node dual to @xmath749 to the node dual to @xmath752 . by virtue of property @xmath396 for the pair @xmath760 of trees",
    ", the path does not cross the boundary of @xmath761 .",
    "together with the first point above , this shows that also the original path from @xmath743 to @xmath744 along @xmath423 does not cross the boundary of @xmath762 .",

    "* lemma [ lemma : separation ] . * _ the coarse observables and the fine observables form two mutually - commuting subalgebras of the rooted holonomy - flux algebra @xmath171 , which we denote respectively by @xmath481 and @xmath482 . _",
    "+ the proof of lemma [ lemma : separation ] can be obtained by a direct calculation .",
    "first of all , it is clear that @xmath481 and @xmath482 each form a subalgebra which reproduces the poisson structure on @xmath763 .",
    "the nontrivial statement is to show that these subalgebras are mutually commuting .",
    "since holonomies are always poisson - commuting , the holonomies in @xmath481 have vanishing poisson brackets with the holonomies in @xmath482 .",
    "in addition to this , since the leaves @xmath426 and @xmath444 are always distinct , the holonomies in @xmath481 commute with all the fluxes in @xmath482 .",
    "let us now turn to the commutation relations between the fluxes in @xmath481 and the holonomies in @xmath482 . in , in addition to the leaf @xmath426 which always exists in @xmath764 , we have a leaf @xmath444 in the same pre - image .",
    "therefore , for a given @xmath208 the poisson bracket between @xmath476 and @xmath535 contains two contributions , which are in turn vanishing since ( __i)^k,_i=^k__i+^k__i , g__ig__i^-1=g__i^kg__i^-1-g__i^kg__i^-1 = 0 .",
    "similarly , for we have that ( __i)^k,_i=^k__i+^k_(_i)^-1,g__ig__i = g__i^kg__i - g__i^kg__i = 0 .",
    "for , since the leaf @xmath444 does not belong to the pre - image of any leaf @xmath208 , it does not appear in the coarse observable @xmath476 and therefore the poisson brackets @xmath765 are identically vanishing .",
    "this shows that the fluxes in @xmath481 commute with the holonomies in @xmath482 .",
    "finally , let us look at the commutation relations between the fluxes in @xmath481 and the fluxes in @xmath482 . for , since @xmath766 , the unique contribution coming from this finer leaf to will be a flux @xmath767 .",
    "however , because of the reversed orientation of the leaf in , the poisson brackets are vanishing since @xmath768 .",
