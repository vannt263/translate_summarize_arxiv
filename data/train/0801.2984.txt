    "motivated by his finding that zero - point fluctuations may induce an attractive force between parallel conducting plates @xcite , casimir proposed in 1956 that the zero - point force could be the poincar stress involved a semiclassical model of the electron @xcite . in that model",
    "the electron was considered as a spherical charge distribution stabilized by vacuum fluctuations . however ,",
    "t. h. boyer @xcite showed in 1968 that the stress for a spherical conducting shell of radius @xmath0 is indeed repulsive , since the casimir energy turns out to be positive : @xmath1 .",
    "subsequent calculations based on the green s function method @xcite , or a multiple scattering formalism @xcite confirmed boyer s calculation . the more general problem of the casimir effect of a dielectric ball was first considered by milton @xcite in absence of dispersion , and later on by candelas @xcite .",
    "candelas argued that in presence of boundaries vacuum energies depend on a cutoff on transverse momenta , independently of the dielectric properties of the media .",
    "therefore , boyer s result should be corrected by terms associated to surface and curvature tensions .",
    "the casimir forces for a dilute dielectric and diamagnetic sphere was studied by brevik and kolventvedt @xcite , and more recently by klich @xcite , while the role of dispersion in this problem was discussed in refs.@xcite . in this case , the casimir stress may be @xmath2 , but very sensitive to the specific values of the parameters characterizing the electric and magnetic response of the materials . an excellent review of different approaches to the casimir effect of spherical regions , together with applications to qcd bag models , higher dimensional spaces , or sonoluminescence can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in a series of papers @xcite an expression for the casimir force within planar cavities was derived without making particular models or assumptions about the nature of the walls . by considering",
    "that the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium , we obtained the energy and the stress tensor in a closed ancillary system that has the same optical response as the original system .",
    "this approach consistently incorporates evanescent fields and allows a fully quantum - mechanical treatment of the electromagnetic degrees of freedom .",
    "unlike the calculations presented in @xcite in ref.@xcite the fictitious system was eliminated , keeping only its essential property : that detailed balance should hold in thermodynamic equilibrium : for each photon that is not coherently reflected at the cavity walls and is therefore either absorbed or transmitted beyond the system , an identical photon has to be incoherently injected back into the cavity with no phase relation with the lost photon . in this paper",
    "we show that that approach may be straightforwardly generalized to study the casimir effect of spherical cavities with arbitrary dielectric properties .",
    "we then apply the formalism to calculate the energy shift for a polarizable atom placed at the center of a cavity .",
    "consider a system made up of an empty spherical cavity of radius @xmath3 carved out of an arbitrary material and with a scatterer situated at its center ( fig . [ cavity ] ) . within the empty space of the cavity",
    "there are outgoing ( @xmath4 ) and ingoing ( @xmath5 ) electromagnetic waves with transverse electric ( te ) and transverse magnetic ( tm ) polarization , described by the field @xmath6 where @xmath7 describes the propagation direction , @xmath8 describes the polarization , @xmath9 denotes the angular momentum , @xmath10 its projection along the @xmath11 axis , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the outgoing and the ingoing spherical hankel functions respectively , @xmath14 is the wavenumber within vacuum , and we choose the scalar field @xmath15 to describe the te electromagnetic field @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 to describe the tm electromagnetic field @xmath19 , @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "when the outgoing radiation reaches the boundary of the cavity it is partially scattered back into the cavity with an amplitude @xmath21 , and when the ingoing radiation hits the scatterer at the center it is scattered back towards the cavity with an amplitude @xmath22 , that is , @xmath23 @xmath24 where we removed the indices @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 to simplify our notation .    from eqs . ( [ sb ] ) and ( [ sc ] ) we immediately obtain the _",
    "normal modes _ of the system , given by @xmath28 taking into account the frequency ( @xmath29 ) dependence of @xmath30 and @xmath31 we may solve eq .",
    "( [ normal ] ) to obtain the frequency spectrum @xmath32 for each value of @xmath33",
    ". however , in the presence of absorbing materials or even of transparent , leaky materials , @xmath32 would turn out to be complex .",
    "the system would be _ open _ and ordinary quantum mechanics would not be applicable to the radiation field , i.e. , @xmath34 would not be an energy quantum .    the coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath31 describe the amplitude and the phase of the radiation that is coherently scattered back into the cavity .",
    "the energy that is not coherently scattered back into the cavity , described by @xmath35 and @xmath36 , is absorbed or it leaves the system through its external boundary .",
    "nevertheless , in thermodynamic equilibrium , an absorbing scatterer or an absorbing enclosure has to eventually radiate back any radiation that it absorbs .",
    "the system should also admit photons from the vacuum that surrounds it to replenish those photons that were transmitted away .",
    "detailed balance must hold and in the average , for each photon with numbers @xmath33 that leaves the cavity , an identical photon , with the same numbers but having no phase relation with the original photon , has to be injected back into the cavity .",
    "we mimic this incoherent radiation by a coherent field that is delayed a large time @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) . to avoid interference with the coherently scattered field",
    "we take the limit @xmath39 .",
    "thus , the incoherent radiation may be taken into account by replacing the scattering coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath31 by _ total _ scattering coefficients @xmath40 here , @xmath41 is the phase acquired during the large delay @xmath37 and is an extremely fast varying function of the frequency @xmath29 , so that for any finite bandwidth interference effects would disappear .",
    "we assume that @xmath42 and @xmath43 are relatively slowly varying functions of frequency which are to be determined .",
    "the term @xmath44 in the numerator corresponds to the coherent scattering .",
    "the term @xmath45 corresponds to re - radiation by the central scatterer ( @xmath46 ) , re - radiation by the walls of the cavity ( @xmath47 ) , or to photons that enter the system from outside to replenish the cavity losses .",
    "finally , it may happen that a re - radiated photon fails to reach the cavity on its first attempt , as it may be re - absorbed or scattered away .",
    "thus , we should allow for multiple injection attempts .",
    "these are accounted for by the term @xmath48 in the denominator .",
    "as all the energy that leaves the cavity has to enter again in an equilibrium situation , the total scattering amplitudes must obey @xmath49 which yields @xmath50 separating the slowly from the rapidly varying terms , @xmath51 we obtain @xmath52 where @xmath53 are a slowly varying phases .",
    "the normal modes of the system in equilibrium are not given by eq .",
    "( [ normal ] ) but by @xmath54 which may be recast as @xmath55 with integer @xmath56 .",
    "the first two terms in the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ phase ] ) oscillate rapidly , but are bounded within the interval @xmath57 , while the second term is slowly varying .",
    "thus , the separation between nearby modes @xmath32 is close to @xmath58 and the density of modes diverges in the limit @xmath59 .",
    "this is to be expected , as our delayed re - radiation accounts implicitly for the interaction with a thermal bath which has infinite degrees of freedom . our dissipative system together with the thermal bath forms an extended closed system whose modes are actually real @xcite and form a quasi - continuum .",
    "our approach above is an alternative to the introduction of ancillary systems to account for dissipation @xcite .",
    "the actual number of modes @xmath60 within a small frequency range @xmath61 may be obtained using cauchy s argument principle @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a contour that encircles counterclockwise the interval @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is an analytical function that has the same zeroes as @xmath66 ( eq . ( [ normal ] ) ) and no poles within @xmath63 .",
    "we choose a contour @xmath63 that moves towards the right a distance @xmath67 below the real axis , then crosses the axis , moves back a distance @xmath67 above the real axis , and finally crosses the axis to closes upon itself @xcite ( fig . [ gamma ] ) .    choosing as @xmath65 the analytical continuation from the real axis unto the complex plane of @xmath68 we obtain @xmath69 + i(\\delta_b+\\delta_c )",

    "( [ deltan ] ) by replacing @xmath73 , @xmath74 , we obtain @xmath75 where we identify the contribution of the scatterers to the density of states , @xmath76 for each value of @xmath33 .    from the density of states , one can proceed to calculate all the thermodynamic quantities . for example , multiplying @xmath77 by the ground state energy @xmath78 of an oscillator of frequency @xmath29 , integrating over all frequencies and adding over all angular momenta and polarizations we obtain the contribution of the scatterers to the ground state energy , @xmath79 where we have already rotated the integration trajectory unto the imaginary axis .",
    "( [ u0 ] ) and similar equations easily derived for other thermodynamic quantities are the main results of the present paper . in order to evaluate them the only requirement",
    "is knowledge of the scattering amplitudes corresponding to the surface of the cavity and to the scatterer at the center .",
    "for an empty cavity @xmath80 , as the incoming field becomes an outgoing field after crossing the origin .",
    "if the cavity is surrounded by a uniform medium with a dielectric function @xmath81 , then @xmath21 may be easily found by writing the field within the cavity as a linear combination of outgoing and ingoing fields ( eq . ( [ flm ] ) ) , writing the field within the medium as an outgoing field and matching both solutions through the usual boundary conditions , i.e. , the continuity of the projections of both the electric and magnetic field along the surface .",
    "the result @xcite is simply given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 @xmath84 is the wavenumber within vacuum ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 ) or within the medium ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 ) , @xmath89 are the ingoing ( @xmath90 ) or outgoing ( @xmath91 ) spherical hankel functions , and @xmath92 is the operator @xmath93 similarly , for tm polarization we have @xmath94 as @xmath21 is independent of @xmath26 , we may replace the sum over @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ u0 ] ) by a factor of @xmath95 .    in fig .",
    "[ fstm ] we show the tm contribution to the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ u0 ] ) as a function of the imaginary part of the frequency @xmath96 calculated for a dielectric cavity with a lorentzian response @xmath97 .",
    "the figure shows integrable singularities at @xmath98 .",
    "a second singularity is seen for even values of @xmath25 .",
    "nevertheless , it is clearly seen that the contributions to the energy grow with @xmath25 and that eq .",
    "( [ u0 ] ) does nt converge .",
    "our calculation above includes a realistic dielectric response for the medium surrounding the cavity and in our calculation the electromagnetic field permeates all space .",
    "thus , the singularities above are of a different physical nature than the singularities arising in naive calculations for flat surfaces . for example , the singularities in the casimir force among perfect conducting slabs may be removed by introducing a high frequency cutoff which accounts for the high frequency transparency of real metals and when the mechanical properties of the field beyond the slabs is accounted for .",
    "those recipes would nt cure the present divergence .",
    "notice that large @xmath25 s correspond to spatial oscillations around the sphere with a small lengthscale @xmath99 . as we may assume a smallest lengthscale @xmath100 of atomic dimensions",
    ", it seems reasonable to impose a corresponding cutoff at @xmath101 .",
    "a careful analysis @xcite shows that in this case eq . ( [ u0 ] ) converges , but that the leading terms are of order @xmath102 and @xmath103 , i.e. , of the order of the number of atoms within the volume and the surface of a sphere of radius @xmath3 .",
    "mathematically , these terms arise from the leading terms in an expansion of the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ u0 ] ) for large @xmath25 , which , after summing over @xmath26 are of order @xmath104 and @xmath25 ( with logarithmic corrections ) . physically , the reason is that eq .",
    "( [ u0 ] ) includes the electromagnetic interaction between nearest neighbor atoms , which in a continuum description are infinitely small and infinitely close to each other .",
    "similar divergent terms were found in a pairwise perturbative calculation @xcite for cavities surrounded by a very diluted dielectric . as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , these short range contributions should be taken into account before conclusions about the sign of the casimir force can be drawn .",
    "a finite casimir energy may be obtained by subtracting from our result above those terms that contribute to the divergence before we take the limit @xmath105 .",
    "nevertheless , the resulting energy would be an experimentally inaccessible quantity for a spherical cavity , as changing the cavity radius would require adding or removing atoms or else introducing strains that would produce an elastic stress @xcite . furthermore , a full calculation of the interatomic interactions would be required in order to compare experimental results to theoretical calculations , and our eq .",
    "( [ u0 ] ) would be insufficient .",
    "one way out of these difficulties is to study other geometries where motion introduces no elastic stresses .",
    "for example , it has been found @xcite that for a piston sliding along a cylinder , the contribution of its position to the casimir energy is free of cutoff dependent singularities and is attractive .",
    "on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ u0 ] ) would still be useful in situations where the geometry of the cavity is left unchanged .",
    "for example , it may be used to calculate the change @xmath106 in the energy of the system when an atom is introduced at the center of the cavity . using the usual selection rules",
    ", we obtain that the dispersion amplitude for an atom , @xmath80 , would be the same as for empty space , unless @xmath107 and the polarization @xmath108 , in which case , @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the electric - dipole polarizability of the atom .",
    "therefore , there is only one finite term in eq .",
    "( [ deltau0 ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ figdu ] we show the contribution to the energy of a cavity from an atom lying at its center .",
    "the atomic polarizability is taken as a lorentzian @xmath111 with a single resonance frequency @xmath112 .",
    "the energy is negative and proportional to @xmath113 and is of the order of tens of mev s for radii of a few nanometers .",
    "based on a scattering approach we have derived an expression for the casimir energy of a spherical cavity with dispersive and absorptive dielectric properties .",
    "it turns out that the expression is divergent due to the summation over angular momenta , independently of the dielectric behavior of the cavity walls .",
    "this may be regularized by imposing a cutoff associated with the finite separation of atomic scatterers forming the boundary of the cavity , leading to contributions proportional to the number of atoms in the volume and surface of the cavity . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy shift for an atomic radiator placed in the center of the cavity is finite , since it does not require to perform virtual work to modify the geometry of the cavity",
