    "the photochemistry of co plays an important role in photon dominated regions ( pdrs ) of interstellar clouds , circumstellar shells surrounding agb stars , planetary nebulae , circumstellar disks around young stars , and comets .",

    "2004a ) , the large number of transitions leading to photodissociation warrants a careful assessment of as many measurements as possible . here",
    "we present results on the @xmath0 ( 1 - 0 ) , @xmath1 ( 6 - 0 ) , and core excited @xmath13(@xmath14)@xmath15 ( @xmath3 - 0 ) bands with @xmath3 @xmath4 0 to 3 for @xmath6c@xmath7o , @xmath8c@xmath7o , and @xmath8c@xmath9o acquired at the super aco synchrotron source in orsay , france .",

    "the limitation on the short wavelength end was the presence of lif windows for the gas cell .",
    "more recently , a system without windows based on differential pumping allowed us to measure co absorption from bands with wavelengths approaching 912  , the lyman limit .",
    "eidelsberg et al .",

    "we now turn our attention to the other transitions involving rydberg states that were acquired during the same synchrotron runs .",
    "the transitions discussed in the present paper are seen in interstellar spectra ( sheffer et al . 2003 ) and are important for co photodissociation ( van dishoeck & black 1988 ) .",

    "( 2004a ) , we only provide a brief overview here .",
    "the measurements were obtained on the super aco synchrotron ring using the high spectral resolution su5 beam line ( nahon et al . 2001a , b ) .",
    "the spectrometer consisted of a 2400 lines mm@xmath19 sic grating blazed at 13 ev .",
    "the entrance and exit slits were set at 35 or 25 @xmath20 m , yielding respective instrumental widths of 30 or 20 m , as deduced from the analysis based on profile simulation described below .",

    "the pressure in the cell , typically 1 to 10 mtorr except for the weakest bands , was measured with a capacitance gauge whose full scale was 10 torr .",
    "the stability of the pressure was checked by monitoring a cold cathode ionization gauge in the differentially pumped section where typical pressures were 10@xmath22 torr .",
    "the vuv flux exiting the gas cell was detected with a photomultiplier tube ( emi 9558qb ) placed after a sodium salicylate coated window acting as a scintillator .",
    "the digitized signal from the pmt was recorded on a pc .",
    "oscillator strengths ( @xmath11-values ) were derived through syntheses of the measured absorption bands . as noted in eidelsberg et al .",
    "( 2004a ) , two independent codes were used to check for consistency , where agreement at the 2% level was achieved .",
    "previous analyses of absorption from rydberg bands of co with the toledo - based code included the experimental work of federman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and the interstellar study of sheffer et al .",
    "the code developed in meudon was used on @xmath23 bands ( eidelsberg et al .",
    "1999 ) and intersystem transitions ( rostas et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the synthetic spectra were based on tabulated spectroscopic data ( eidelsberg et al .",
    "each synthetic spectrum was adjusted to match the experimental one in a non - linear least - squares fitting procedure with band oscillator strength , line width ( instrumental , thermal , and predissociation ) , and wavelength offset as free parameters .",
    "initial fits revealed that the thermal width was consistent with doppler broadening at 295 k and was held constant in subsequent syntheses .",

    "( 1993 ) and eikema , hogervorst , and ubachs ( 1994 ) .",
    "the situation for the @xmath132 bands required special care . according to eikema et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , the predissociation width is independent of @xmath12 until @xmath12 @xmath4 6 , but dependent on @xmath12 for @xmath12 @xmath26 6 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 components in all isotopologues .",
    "we first determined the @xmath12-independent part of the width from lines up to q(6 ) and p(3 ) , and then fitted the whole band to derive the @xmath12-dependent part and the @xmath11-value .    the first step in",
    "the analysis was to obtain an accurate measure of the co column in the differentially - pumped system .",
    "this was achieved through profile fits of the @xmath250 band near 1075   for each isotopologue . since the 3@xmath27 ( @xmath3 @xmath4 0 ) state is relatively isolated and",
    "can be considered essentially free of perturbations , the band @xmath11-value was assumed to be the same for the three isotopologues .",
    "predissociation widths of 0.067 m  for @xmath6c@xmath7o , 0.049 m  for @xmath8c@xmath7o , and 0.047 m  for @xmath8c@xmath9o ( cacciani et al .",
    "1998 ) were used as input .",
    "the pressure deduced from the fit to the @xmath250 band was typically within 10% of the value given by the pressure gauge .",
    "the deduced pressure was then adopted in syntheses of the bands of primary interest scanned with the same set of conditions .",
    "for the high pressures needed to measure absorption from the @xmath251 band of @xmath8c@xmath9o  24 to 58 mtorr , the values from the pressure gauge were used .    examples of our fits for @xmath251 , @xmath28 and @xmath133 , and @xmath296 bands appear in figs . 1 to 3 , respectively .",

    "the ( fwhm ) lorentzian line widths ( @xmath40 ) that were determined from the spectra are linked to the corresponding upper level lifetimes ( @xmath41 ) and transition rates ( @xmath42 ) by the well known relation , @xmath40 = 1/(2@xmath43 ) = ( 1/2@xmath44)@xmath42 ( @xmath42 @xmath4 @xmath40(m )  [ 1000/@xmath45()]@xmath46  @xmath47 s@xmath19 , where @xmath45 is the band origin for the transition ) .",

    "there generally is no difference in @xmath11-values among isotopologues within the uncertainty of our measurements .",
    "one exception involves the @xmath296 band of @xmath8c@xmath9o , the @xmath11-value of which is significantly smaller than that of the other isotopologues .",
    "it is to be noted that the 3@xmath49 ( 0 - 0 ) band appears on the blue wing of the @xmath296 band in @xmath8c@xmath9o , while it is not seen in the other two isotopologues at the pressures used here ( @xmath50 24 mtorr ) . as was shown in the detailed study of eidelsberg et al .",
    "( 2004b ) , the 3@xmath510 band borrows its intensity from the @xmath296 band .",
    "this effect is weak for the first two isotopologues , allowing this band to be seen only at high column density . for the @xmath296 band of @xmath8c@xmath9o",
    ", it appears that the mixing is stronger , leading to similar intensities for the two bands .",
    "the pertinent value to consider is thus the sum of the @xmath296 and 3@xmath510 oscillator strengths .",
    "this is about 0.0066 , a value more in line with the @xmath11-value for the other isotopologues .",
    "the second exception , @xmath131 in @xmath8c@xmath9o , is so severe that we are not able to derive an @xmath11-value .",
    "this band is strongly overlapped by another band of unknown origin , whose profile does not resemble a @xmath52 or @xmath53 band .",
    "since its intensity varies with pressure as @xmath131 does , the band probably arises from a valence state perturber .",
    "thus it is not possible to separate its contribution from that of @xmath131 .",
    "finally , we note that the @xmath11-values for the @xmath13 bands are relatively strong , with the ( 2 - 0 ) band being the strongest .",
    "the results for the @xmath13 bands are consistent with the theoretical predictions of cooper & kirby ( 1988 ) @xmath21 i.e. , @xmath11-values of about 10@xmath54 and franck - condon factors favoring the ( 2 - 0 ) band .",
    "our oscillator strengths are generally consistent with earlier determinations . however , the previous absorption experiments using synchrotron sources ( eidelsberg et al .",
    "1991 ; stark et al .",
    "1991 , 1992 , 1993 ; yoshino et al . 1995 ) tend to have somewhat smaller @xmath11-values than ours and those from the interstellar study of sheffer et al .",

    "( 2003 ) , and eidelsberg et al .",
    "( 2004a ) are less of an issue for the current set of transitions because they are weaker or have intrinsic line widths that are broadened by predissociation ( see below ) .",
    "the one instance where optical depth effects may have played a role involves the results for @xmath251 of eidelsberg et al .",
    "( 1991 ) since predissociation is a minor channel for this band .",
    "a comparison of predissociation rates apppears in table 2 .",
    "whenever possible , results for @xmath10 and @xmath11 parity are given separately .",
    "the @xmath55 term listed for many of the entries indicates how the width depends on @xmath12 [ @xmath39 @xmath4 @xmath56  @xmath57  @xmath55  @xmath12(@xmath12@xmath571 ) ] .",
    "except for the results by eidelsberg et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , which were based on low - resolution spectra of absorption against continua from a synchrotron , the other values given in this table are studies involving laser excitation .",
    "for the most part , there is general agreement among all results .",
    "factors of a few difference ( at most ) exist between our widths and the order of magnitude evaluations given by eidelsberg et al .",
    "although the number of results for comparison with those from laser studies is smaller , the agreement is very good .",
    "the most significant differences are found with the widths derived by drabbels et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , especially in light of the fact that the other studies yield a set of consistent results .",
    "the close correspondence with the laser studies , when available , gives us confidence in our other determinations .",
    "these will provide modelers of co photodissociation with a more complete set of predissociation rates .",
    "we also note that since the rates have values greater than 10@xmath58 s@xmath19 , the corresponding predissociation lifetimes are 0.1 ns or less , which are significantly less than radiative lifetimes ( @xmath59 1 ns ) .",
    "thus , predissociation represents the primary decay channel for the upper states involved in the @xmath296 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 transitions studied here .",
    "we presented results for oscillator strengths and predissociation rates for rydberg transitions in @xmath6c@xmath7o , @xmath8c@xmath7o , and @xmath8c@xmath9o .",
    "in particular , the @xmath24 ( 1 - 0 ) , @xmath60 ( 6 - 0 ) , and @xmath61 ( @xmath3  @xmath4  0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  3-@xmath35  @xmath4  0 ) bands were studied via absorption of synchrotron radiation .",
    "this suite of measurements represents the most complete database available at the present time for these transitions .",
    "our oscillator strengths agree essentially with earlier determinations and expand upon available results for the rarer isotopologues .",
    "the same applies to the values for predissociation rates , but now our larger set of measurements provides @xmath12-dependent rates for most of the transitions in the present study .",
    "our measurements are especially useful for chemical models that incorporate details of co photodissociation .",
    "oscillator strengths and predissociation rates are now available to examine selective isotope photodissociation with greater precision .",
    "we note that the significant line widths for the @xmath60 ( 6 - 0 ) and @xmath61 ( @xmath3  @xmath4  0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  3 - 0 ) bands minimize the importance of these transitions to selective self shielding , where the more abundant forms of co are protected from dissociation , because optical depths at line center can not reach large values .    with the tools now available to us , we plan to extend our set of measurements to other transitions below 1000  .",
    "we will utilize the high - resolution beam line on soleil , the next - generation synchrotron in france , which is nearing completion with first light expected in 2007 .",
    "high resolution is necessary to extract predissociation widths for the transitions important for modeling co photodissociation in pdrs .",
