    "entanglement plays a crucial role in quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "some of typical entangled states , such as bell state  @xcite , greenberger - horne - zeilinger  ( ghz ) state  @xcite and w state  @xcite , have attracted great attention in the last decades .",
    "however , all of these states are entangled states that are defined in hilbert spaces with two dimensions .",
    "recently , high - dimensional entanglement has attracted more and more attention due to their superior security than qubit systems , especially in the aspect of quantum key distribution . besides , it has been demonstrated that violations of local realism by two entangled high - dimensional systems are stronger than that by two - dimensional systems  @xcite .",
    "thus , much interest has been focused on the generation of high - dimensional entanglement in theory via various techniques including quantum zeno dynamics  ( qzd )  @xcite , stimulated raman adiabatic passage  ( stirap )  @xcite , and dissipative dynamics  @xcite .",
    "also , experimental generations of high - dimensional entanglement have been already achieved  @xcite .    with no doubt , a lot of remarkable achievements have been made with regard to high - dimensional entangled states",
    ". however , most of these high - dimensional entangled states are two - body but few multi - body . for a dozen years",
    ", some attention has been paid to multi - body high - dimensional entangled states such as singlet state  @xcite , and lots of schemes have been proposed for generations of singlet state  @xcite .",
    "a short time before , a novel three - body three - dimensional entangled state called tree - type entanglement was prepared via adiabatic passage by song @xmath0  @xcite . in the reference",
    "@xcite , the tree - type three - dimensional entanglement was prepared among one single atom and two becs and the authors predicted that the tree - type three - dimensional entanglement is likely to have great applications in improving quantum communication security .    among the techniques mentioned above for generations of high - dimensional entanglement ,",
    "there are two techniques widely used for their robustness against decoherence in certain conditions .",
    "one is stirap  @xcite , and the other is qzd  @xcite .",
    "stirap is widely used in time - dependent interacting fields and robust against the atomic spontaneous emission and variations in the experimental parameters , but a relatively long interaction time is usually required .",
    "qzd is usually robust against photon leakages and does not need a long interaction time",
    ". however qzd is sensitive to the atomic spontaneous emissions and variations in the experimental parameters .",
    "thus some of researchers introduce detuning between the atomic transitions to restrain the influence of atomic spontaneous emissions  @xcite , but the interaction time significantly increases unavoidably .",
    "therefore , in order to solve the problem of long interaction time , researchers have paid more attention to `` shortcut to adiabatic passage '' which employs a set of techniques to speed up a slow quantum adiabatic process  @xcite , in which chen @xmath0 implemented entangled states fast preparation via shortcut to adiabatic passage  @xcite , lin @xmath0 fast generated the two - atom three - dimensional entanglement via lewis - riesenfeld invariants  ( lri )  @xcite , and chen @xmath0 fast prepared the three - atom singlet state by transitionless quantum driving  ( tqd )  @xcite .    in this paper , we propose two schemes for fast generations of tree - type three - dimensional entanglement among three spatially separated atoms via lri and tqd , respectively . based on lri and tqd we construct effective shortcuts to adiabatic passage for fast generating tree - type three - dimensional entanglement among three atoms trapped respectively in three spatially separated cavities connected by two fibers .",
    "we will give the interesting comparisons between the lri method and the tqd method .",
    "the generations of tree - type three - dimensional entanglement in our schemes are implemented within a short time and the strict numerical simulations demonstrate that our schemes are both robust against the decoherence caused by the atomic spontaneous emissions , photon leakages and the variations in the parameters .",

    "[ f7 ]  * ( a ) * , the highest value of the cavity - fiber excited populations  ( blue dashed line ) of the tqd method is over 0.2 during the evolution process but that of the atomic excited populations  ( blue solid line ) of the tqd method is near zero which caused by the detuning @xmath115 .",
    "the highest values of the atomic excited populations  ( red solid line ) and the cavity - fiber excited populations  ( red dashed line ) of the lri method are slightly higher and slightly lower than 0.05 , respectively .",
    "therefore , it is no doubt that the results of fig .",
    "[ f7 ] and fig .",
    "[ f9 ] are corresponding to each other .",
    "finally , it is necessary to emphasize that the fidelities of the lri method and the tqd method are near 0.94 and over 0.955 respectively , even when @xmath194 .",
    "therefore , our two schemes of the lri method and the tqd method both are robust against the decoherence induced by the atomic spontaneous emissions and photon leakages of the cavity - fiber system .",
    "now we show the experimental feasibility of our schemes .",
    "as mentioned in the reference  @xcite , @xmath195 can be used in our schemes to construct the required atomic level configurations . for @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 and @xmath198 of 5@xmath199",

    ", we will obtain the very high fidelities @xmath206 and @xmath207 corresponding to the lri method and the tqd method respectively , which show our schemes to prepare tree - type three - dimensional entangled states both are feasible in the experiment .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have proposed two schemes to speed up the generations of the tree - type three - dimensional entanglement via lewis - riesenfeld invariants and transitionless quantum driving .",
    "the two tree - type three - dimensional entangled states are prepared among three atoms trapped respectively in three spatially separated optical cavities which are connected by two fibers .",
    "the operation time @xmath129 is far shorter than @xmath208 which is the generation time of the tree - type three - dimensional entanglement generated in the reference  @xcite .",
    "the strict numerical simulations show that the lri method and the tqd method both are feasible and robust against the variations in the parameters , atomic spontaneous emissions and photon leakages of the cavity - fiber system . besides , comparing the two methods , we know they both have their own advantages and disadvantages .",
    "so we can choose different methods depending on different conditions in experiment .",
    "in short , both of our schemes are fast , feasible and robust .",
