    "in a recent paper  @xcite we performed an analysis of how a non - vanishing neutrino transition magnetic moment involving second and third families , @xmath1 , could affect the flavour conversion of solar neutrinos . at that time we assumed a vanishing @xmath0 , which allowed to produce a large flux of non - electronic anti - neutrinos , and our model",
    "was not limited by the absence of electron anti - neutrinos @xmath4 in solar neutrino flux , as required by kamland  @xcite .",
    "however , in that paper it was argued that a non - vanishing @xmath0 would open a channel for the production of electron anti - neutrinos , and then a limit on @xmath1 could be established from the absence of a signal of @xmath4 in solar neutrino flux . since recent data indicates a relatively large value for this angle , we examine such limits in light of this new measurements .",
    "to calculate the probability that a electron neutrino produced at the sun evolves into an electron anti - neutrino in the presence of transition magnetic moments , in principle we would have to work using a 6@xmath56 evolution matrix formalism , involving @xmath6 .",
    "but the system can be simplified in specific cases .",
    "for instance , in  @xcite we assumed a vanishing value for @xmath0 , and rotating out the @xmath7-mixing with the definition @xmath8 , the system was decoupled into two 3@xmath53 systems , which can be presented with a convenient reordering of eigenstates as : @xmath9 &      \\begin{array}{ccc }   & & \\\\ & 0 & \\\\ & & \\end{array } \\\\",
    "\\begin{array}{ccc }   & & \\\\ & 0 & \\\\ & & \\end{array } &      \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc }   & & \\\\ & \\tilde{a } & \\\\ & & \\end{array}\\right ]   \\end{array } \\right ) \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } \\nu_e \\\\ \\nu_\\mu ' \\\\ \\bar{\\nu}'_\\tau \\\\ \\bar\\nu_e \\\\ \\bar{\\nu}'_\\mu \\\\ \\nu_\\tau '    \\end{array } \\right)\\label{motion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the same as @xmath12 with a change of sign on matter potentials . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are linear combinations of weak states as @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and with similar definitions to anti - neutrinos @xmath17 .",
    "also , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the charged current and neutral current interaction potentials with matter .",
    "since all neutrinos in the sun are produced as electron neutrinos and the two systems are completely decoupled , no @xmath4 was produced . for a regular magnetic field in the convective zone of the order of @xmath22 kg and for magnetic moments of the order of @xmath23 @xmath24 we do not expect any transition to anti - neutrinos , since @xmath25 however , random fluctuations of magnetic fields in convective zone are expected and promote the population of anti - neutrino states families  @xcite .",
    "this is implemented through symmetric entries in liouville equation , which induces decoherence , raising the @xmath26 conversion probability .",
    "nevertheless , when a non - vanishing value of @xmath0 is assumed , we can not decouple the system , and have to solve the full 6@xmath56 evolution equation .",
    "rotating out both the mixing angles @xmath0 and @xmath27 , we would have the following evolution matrix in the basis @xmath28 conveniently rearranged as in eq .",
    "( [ motion ] ) :    @xmath29&\\left[\\tilde{b}\\right ] \\\\",
    "\\left[b\\right ] & \\left[\\tilde{a}\\right ] \\end{array}\\right)\\nu'\\ ] ]    with @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath11 ( @xmath34 ) equals @xmath12 ( @xmath35 ) by changing sign in matter potential terms .",
    "we will assume that the magnetic field is composed by a regular part and a random part .",
    "again , for a regular magnetic field we do not expect significant production of anti - neutrinos .",
    "however , assuming a random component of the magnetic field , anti - neutrinos can be produced through different channels .    to include the random magnetic fields with the same procedure",
    ", we should use the density matrix formalism . from the @xmath36 hamiltonian matrix",
    ", we get in the matrix density formalism a 35@xmath535 evolution system . due to the complications of this procedure",
    "we will present later the full analysis of the system  @xcite , but we can get a good estimative assuming for now that the antineutrino production process will not be very different than in the scenario with vanishing @xmath0 .",
    "our procedure then would be to calculate the anti - neutrino production by the same assumption of last paper , a vanishing @xmath0 , and then calculate the amount of @xmath4 which is present in this anti - neutrino state in accordance with the measured value of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "when we considered in  @xcite that @xmath37 , the @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ motion ] ) was identical to the mass eigenstate @xmath39 . as mentioned before",
    ", we will consider that the inclusion of a non - vanishing @xmath0 will not strongly change this production probability .",
    "however , the distribution of such anti - neutrino in the mass eigenstates is now : @xmath40 averaging out all terms involving oscillation between different mass scales when calculating the probabilities and assuming large values of the other mixing angles , we can write the electron anti - neutrino production as : @xmath41    kamland  @xcite sets the strongest limit in the electronic anti - neutrino flux from the sun , given by @xmath42 @xmath43s@xmath44 .",
    "writing in terms of a production probability and using solar model labeled gs98 in  @xcite where @xmath45 @xmath43s@xmath44 , we obtain an upper limit of the electronic anti - neutrino production of @xmath46 .",
    "considering all recent measurements of @xmath47  @xcite , we will use the value of best fit point  @xcite @xmath48 in our analysis .",
    "this translates into a limit on anti - neutrino production of : @xmath49    to calculate the anti - neutrino production probability we follow the procedure presented at  @xcite .",
    "the probability is a function of the parameter @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a length scale related to the spatial coherence of the magnetic fluctuations . rewriting @xmath52 in convenient units , we have",
    ": @xmath53 ^ 2 \\left[\\frac{b}{100\\,{\\rm kg}}\\right]\\left[\\frac{l_0}{200\\,{\\rm km}}\\right]\\ , { \\rm ev}~. \\label{eq : k}\\ ] ]    we solved the evolution equation numerically assuming a vanishing @xmath0 , as in  @xcite . in fig .",
    "1 we present the conversion probability of anti - neutrinos if we assume a vanishing @xmath0 , together with the limits on this probability that can be inferred from kamland data and the measured values of @xmath0 , as presented in eq .",
    "( [ eq : problimit ] ) .",
    "the parameter region where the anti - neutrino production probability is larger than the kamland limit is excluded .    .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the limits set by kamland on solar electronic anti - neutrino flux , converted to a limit on non - electronic anti - neutrino probability conversion , using @xmath54 ( 1@xmath55 )  @xcite .",
    "the dotted lines are obtained with the 1@xmath55 limits for this angle.,width=377 ]    [ faca ]    from fig .",
    "1 we can extract a limit on @xmath52 : @xmath56 which leads , from eq .",
    "[ eq : k ] to the following limit on magnetic field parameters : @xmath57 ^ 2 \\left[\\frac{b}{100\\,{\\rm kg}}\\right]\\left[\\frac{l_0}{200\\,{\\rm km}}\\right]\\ , { \\rm ev}<0.24\\ ] ]    for a reasonable assumption on magnetic field profile , _",
    "i.e. _ a @xmath22 kg regular magnetic field with random fluctuations proportional to the regular one , and a @xmath58 km coherent length scale for such fluctuations , we translate this limit to : @xmath59    such a limit can be compared with the ones coming from modifications on neutrino electroweak cross section  @xcite , which applies for a combination on all neutrino magnetic moment elements .",
    "although our limit is more stringent then the one reported for instance in  @xcite , it depends on both the solar magnetic field profile and the characteristics of its random fluctuations .",
    "in this work we set a limit on the neutrino transition magnetic moment involving the second and third families using solar neutrino data and assuming a specific profile for the solar magnetic field . for a vanishing mixing angle @xmath0 we could only set loose bounds on such magnetic moment due to the electron anti - neutrino flavour decoupling on neutrino evolution equation . now with a reasonable high measured value for such angle , a stringent limit was established , for the first time from the direct interaction of neutrinos with magnetic fields , at the same order of magnitude of the limits involving the first neutrino family and the limits coming from modifications on electroweak cross section .",
    "some approximations were made in the calculations that allowed us to use a previous study to calculate the anti - neutrino appearance probability .",
    "we plan to critically evaluate such approximations in a future work , but we expect that the limits established here are conservative , and a more detailed analysis could open other channels of anti - neutrino production , improving the limit presented here .",
