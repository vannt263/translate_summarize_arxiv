    "since the development of quantum mechanics in the early decades of this century quantum mechanical methods and computational techniques have become a powerful tool for accurate numerical calculations in atomic and molecular systems . the excellent agreement between experimental measurements and quantum calculations has silenced any serious critics on the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics , and there are nowadays no doubts that quantum mechanics is the correct theory for microscopic systems .",
    "nevertheless , there has been an increasing interest in semiclassical theories during recent years .",
    "the reasons for the resurgence of semiclassics are the following .",
    "firstly , the quantum mechanical methods for solving multidimensional , non - integrable systems generically imply intense numerical calculations , e.g. , the diagonalization of a large , but truncated hamiltonian in a suitably chosen basis .",
    "such calculations provide little insight into the underlying dynamics of the system .",
    "by contrast , semiclassical methods open the way to a deeper understanding of the system , and therefore can serve for the interpretation of experimental or numerically calculated quantum mechanical data in physical terms .",
    "secondly , the relation between the quantum mechanics of microscopic systems and the classical mechanics of the macroscopic world is of fundamental interest and importance for a deeper understanding of nature .",
    "this relation was evident in the early days of quantum mechanics , when semiclassical techniques provided the only quantization rules , i.e. , the wkb quantization of one - dimensional systems or the generalization to the einstein - brillouin - keller ( ebk ) quantization @xcite for systems with @xmath1 degrees of freedom .",
    "however , the ebk torus quantization is limited to integrable or at least near - integrable systems . in non - integrable systems",
    "the kam tori are destroyed @xcite , a complete set of classical constants of motion does not exist any more , and therefore the eigenstates of the quantized system can not be characterized by a complete set of quantum numbers .",
    "the `` breakdown '' of the semiclassical quantization rules for non - regular , i.e. , _ chaotic _ systems was already recognized by einstein in 1917 @xcite .",
    "the failure of the `` old '' quantum mechanics to describe more complicated systems such as the helium atom @xcite , and , at the same time , the development and success of the `` modern '' wave mechanics are the reasons for little interest in semiclassical theories for several decades .",
    "the connection between wave mechanics and classical dynamics especially for chaotic systems remained an open question during that period .",

    "although a semiclassical quantization of _ individual _ eigenstates is , in principle , impossible for chaotic systems , gutzwiller derived a semiclassical formula for the density of states as a whole .",
    "starting from the exact quantum expression given as the trace of the green s operator he replaced the exact green s function with its semiclassical approximation . applying stationary phase approximations he could finally write the semiclassical density of states as the sum of a smooth part , i.e. , the weyl term , and an oscillating sum over all periodic orbits of the corresponding classical system . for this reason ,",
    "gutzwiller s theory is also commonly known as _ periodic orbit theory_. gutzwiller s semiclassical trace formula is valid for isolated and unstable periodic orbits , i.e. , for fully chaotic systems with a complete hyperbolic dynamics .",
    "examples of hyperbolic systems are @xmath1-disk repellers , as models for hyperbolic scattering @xcite , the stadium billiard @xcite , the anisotropic kepler problem @xcite , and the hydrogen atom in magnetic fields at very high energies far above the ionization threshold @xcite .",
    "gutzwiller s trace formula is exact only in exceptional cases , e.g. , for the geodesic flow on a surface with constant negative curvature @xcite . in general , the semiclassical periodic orbit sum is just the leading order term of an infinite series in powers of the planck constant , @xmath0 .",
    "methods to derive the higher order contributions of the @xmath0 expansion are presented in refs .",

    "the berry - tabor formula describes the density of states in terms of the periodic orbits of the system and is therefore the analogue of gutzwiller s trace formula for integrable systems .",
    "the equation is known to be formally equivalent to the ebk torus quantization .",

    "generic systems are of mixed type , characterized by the coexistence of regular torus structures and stochastic regions in the classical poincar surface of section .",
    "a typical example is the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field @xcite , which undergoes a transition from near - integrable at low energies to complete hyperbolic dynamics at high excitation . in mixed systems",
    "the classical trajectories , i.e. , the periodic orbits , undergo bifurcations . at bifurcations periodic orbits change their structure and stability properties , new orbits are born , or orbits vanish .",
    "a systematic classification of the various types of bifurcations is possible by application of _ normal form theory _",
    "@xcite , where the phase space structure around the bifurcation point is analyzed with the help of classical perturbation theory in local coordinates defined parallel and perpendicular to the periodic orbit . at bifurcation points periodic orbits are neither isolated nor belong to a regular torus in phase space .",
    "as a consequence the periodic orbit amplitudes diverge in both semiclassical expressions , gutzwiller s trace formula and the berry - tabor formula , i.e. , both formulae are not valid near bifurcations .",
    "the correct semiclassical solutions must simultaneously account for all periodic orbits which participate at the bifurcation , including `` ghost '' orbits @xcite in the complex generalization of phase space , which can be important near bifurcations .",
    "such solutions are called _ uniform semiclassical approximations _ and can be constructed by application of _ catastrophe theory _",

    "uniform semiclassical approximations have been derived in refs .",

    "@xcite for nongeneric bifurcations with higher codimension and corank .    with gutzwiller s trace formula for isolated periodic orbits , the berry - tabor formula for regular tori , and the uniform semiclassical approximations for orbits near bifurcations we have , in principle , the basic equations for the semiclassical investigation of all systems with regular , chaotic , and mixed regular - chaotic dynamics .",
    "there are , however , fundamental problems in practical applications of these equations for the calculation of semiclassical spectra , and the development of techniques to overcome these problems has been the objective of intense research during recent years .",
    "the most serious problem of gutzwiller s trace formula is that for chaotic systems the periodic orbit sum does not converge in the physically interesting energy region , i.e. , on and below the real axis , where the eigenstates of bound systems and the resonances of open systems are located , respectively .",
    "for chaotic systems the sum of the absolute values of the periodic orbit terms diverges exponentially because of the exponential proliferation of the number of orbits with increasing periods .",
    "the convergence problems are similar for the quantization of regular systems with the berry - tabor formula , however , the divergence is algebraic instead of exponential in this case .    because of the technical problems encountered in trying to extract eigenvalues directly from the periodic orbit sum , gutzwiller s trace formula has been used in many applications mainly for the interpretation of experimental or theoretical spectra of chaotic systems .",
    "for example the periodic orbit theory served as basis for the development of _ scaled - energy spectroscopy _ , a method where the classical dynamics of a system is fixed within long - range quantum spectra @xcite .",
    "the fourier transforms of the scaled spectra exhibit peaks at positions given by the classical action of the periodic orbits .",
    "the action spectra can therefore be interpreted directly in terms of the periodic orbits of the system , and the technique of scaled - energy spectroscopy is now well established , e.g. , for investigations of atoms in external fields @xcite .",
    "the resolution of the fourier transform action spectra is restricted by the uncertainty principle of the fourier transform , i.e. , the method allows the identification of usually short orbits in the low - dense part of the action spectra .",
    "a fully resolved action spectrum would require an infinite length of the original scaled quantum spectrum .",
    "although periodic orbit theory has been very successful in the interpretation of quantum spectra , the extraction of individual eigenstates and resonances directly from periodic orbit quantization remains of fundamental interest and importance . as mentioned above",
    "the semiclassical trace formulae diverge at the physical interesting regions .",
    "they are convergent , however , at complex energies with positive imaginary part above a certain value , viz .",
    "the entropy barrier .",
    "thus the problem of revealing the semiclassical eigenenergies and resonances is closely related to finding an analytic continuation of the trace formulae to the region at and below the real axis .",
    "several refinements have been introduced in recent years in order to transform the periodic orbit sum in the physical domain of interest to a conditionally convergent series by , e.g. , using symbolic dynamics and the cycle expansion @xcite , the riemann - siegel look - alike formula and pseudo - orbit expansions @xcite , surface of section techniques @xcite , and heat - kernel regularization @xcite .",
    "these techniques are mostly designed for systems with special properties , e.g. , the cycle expansion requires the existence and knowledge of a symbolic code and is most successful for open systems , while the riemann - siegel look - alike formula and the heat - kernel regularization are restricted to bound systems . until now",
    "there is no _ universal _ method , which allows periodic orbit quantization of a large variety of bound and open systems with an underlying regular , mixed , or chaotic classical dynamics .",
    "the main objective of this work is the development of novel methods for @xmath2 the analysis of quantum spectra and @xmath3 periodic orbit quantization .",
    "the conventional action or recurrence spectra obtained by fourier transformation of finite range quantum spectra suffer from the fundamental resolution problem because of the uncertainty principle of the fourier transformation .",
    "the broadening of recurrence peaks usually prevents the detailed analysis of structures near bifurcations of classical orbits .",
    "we will present a method which allows , e.g. , the detailed analysis of bifurcations and symmetry breaking and the study of higher order @xmath0 corrections to the periodic orbit sum . for periodic orbit quantization",
    "the aim is the development of a universal method for periodic orbit quantization which does not depend on special properties of the system , such as the existence of a symbolic code or the applicability of a functional equation .",
    "as will be shown both problems can be solved by applying methods for _ high resolution spectral analysis _",
    "the computational techniques for high resolution spectral analysis have recently been significantly improved @xcite , and we will demonstrate that the state of the art methods are a powerful tool for the semiclassical quantization and analysis of dynamical systems .      within the semiclassical approximation of gutzwiller s trace formula or the berry - tabor formula the density of states of a scaled quantum spectrum is a superposition of sinusoidal modulations as a function of the energy or an appropriate scaling parameter .",
    "the frequencies of the modulations are determined by the periods , i.e. , the classical action of orbits . the amplitudes and phases of the oscillations depend on the stability properties of the periodic orbits and the maslov indices . to extract information about the classical dynamics from the quantum spectrum",
    "it is therefore quite natural to fourier transform the spectrum from `` energy '' domain to `` time '' ( or , for scaled spectra , `` action '' ) domain @xcite .",
    "the periodic orbits appear as peaks at positions given by the periods of orbits , and the peak heights exhibit the amplitudes of periodic orbit contributions in the semiclassical trace formulae .",
    "the comparison with classical calculations allows the interpretation of quantum spectra in terms of the periodic orbits of the corresponding classical system .",
    "however , the analyzed experimental or theoretical quantum spectra are usually of finite length , and thus the sinusoidal modulations are truncated when fourier transformed .",
    "the truncation implies a broadening of peaks in the time domain spectra because of the uncertainty principle of the fourier transform .",
    "the widths of the recurrence peaks are determined by the total length of the original spectrum .",
    "the uncertainty principle prevents until now precision tests of the semiclassical theories because neither the peak positions ( periods of orbits ) nor the amplitudes can be obtained from the time domain spectra to high accuracy .",
    "furthermore , the uncertainty principle implies an overlapping of broadened recurrence peaks when the separation of neighboring periods is less than the peak widths . in this case",
    "individual periodic orbit contributions can not be revealed any more .",
    "this is especially a disadvantage , e.g. , when following , in quantum spectra of systems with mixed regular - chaotic dynamics , the bifurcation tree of periodic orbits .",
    "all orbits involved in a bifurcation , including complex `` ghost '' orbits @xcite , have nearly the same period close to the bifurcation point .",
    "the details of the bifurcations , especially of catastrophes with higher codimension or corank @xcite , can not be resolved with the help of the conventional fourier transform .",
    "the same is true for the effects of symmetry breaking , e.g. , breaking of the cylindrical symmetry of the hydrogen atom in crossed magnetic and electric fields @xcite or the `` temporal symmetry breaking '' @xcite of atoms in oscillating fields .",
    "the symmetry breaking should result in a splitting of peaks in the fourier transform recurrence spectra . until now",
    "this phenomenon could only be observed indirectly via constructive and destructive interference effects of orbits with broken symmetry @xcite .    to overcome the resolution problem in the conventional recurrence spectra and to achieve a high resolution analysis of quantum spectra",
    "it is first of all necessary to mention that the uncertainty principle of the fourier transformation is not a fundamental restriction to the resolution of the time domain recurrence spectra , and is not comparable to the fundamental heisenberg uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics .",
    "this can be illustrated for the simple example of a sinusoidal function with only one frequency .",
    "the knowledge of the signal at only three points is sufficient to recover , although not uniquely , the three unknown parameters , viz .  the frequency , amplitude and phase of the modulation .",
    "similarly , a superposition of @xmath4 sinusoidal functions can be recovered , in principle , from a set of at least @xmath5 data points @xmath6 .",
    "if the data points are exact the spectral parameters @xmath7 can also be exactly determined from a set of @xmath5 _ nonlinear _",
    "equations @xmath8 i.e. , there is no uncertainty principle .",
    "the main difference between this procedure and the fourier transformation is that we use the linear superposition of sinusoidal functions as an ansatz for the functional form of our data , and the frequencies , amplitudes , and phases are adjusted to obtain the best approximation to the data points . by contrast , the fourier transform is not based on any constraints . in case of a discrete fourier transform ( dft )",
    "the frequencies are chosen on a ( usually equidistant ) grid , and the amplitudes are determined from a _ linear _ set of equations , which can be solved numerically very efficiently , e.g. , by fast fourier transform ( fft ) .    as mentioned above the high precision spectral analysis",
    "requires the numerical solution of a _ nonlinear _ set of equations , and the availability of efficient algorithms has been the bottleneck for practical applications in the past .",
    "several techniques have been developed @xcite , however , most of them are restricted  for reasons of storage requirements , computational time , and stability of the algorithm  to signals with quite low number of frequencies . by contrast",
    ", the number of frequencies ( periodic orbits ) in quantum spectra of chaotic systems is infinite or at least very large , and applied methods for high precision spectral analysis must be able to handle signals with large numbers of frequencies .",
    "this requirement is fulfilled by the method of _ harmonic inversion by filter - diagonalization _ , which was recently developed by wall and neuhauser @xcite and significantly improved by mandelshtam and taylor @xcite .",
    "the decisive step is to recast the nonlinear set of equations as a generalized eigenvalue problem . using an appropriate basis set the generalized eigenvalue equation",
    "is solved with the filter - diagonalization method , which means that the frequencies of the signal can be determined within small frequency windows and only small matrices must be diagonalized numerically even when the signal is composed of a very large number of sinusoidal oscillations .",
    "we will introduce harmonic inversion as a powerful tool for the high precision analysis of quantum spectra , which allows to circumvent the uncertainty principle of the conventional fourier transform analysis and to extract previously unattainable information from the spectra .",
    "in particular the following items are investigated :    * high precision check of semiclassical theories : the analysis of spectra allows a direct quantitative comparison of the quantum and classical periodic orbit quantities to many significant digits . * uncovering of periodic orbit bifurcations in quantum spectra , and the verification of ghost orbits and uniform semiclassical approximations . * direct observation of symmetry breaking effects . * quantitative interpretation of the differences between quantum and semiclassical spectra in terms of the @xmath0 expansion of the periodic orbit sum .",
    "results will be presented for various physical systems , e.g. , the hydrogen atom in external fields , the circle billiard , and the three disk scattering problem .",
    "the analysis of quantum spectra by harmonic inversion and , e.g. , the observation of `` ghost '' orbits , symmetry breaking effects , or higher order @xmath0 corrections to the periodic orbit contributions provides a deeper understanding of the relation between quantum mechanics and the underlying classical dynamics of the system .",
    "however , the inverse procedure , i.e. , the calculation of semiclassical eigenenergies and resonances directly from classical input data is of at least the same importance and even more challenging . as mentioned above the periodic orbit sums",
    "suffer from fundamental convergence problems in the physically interesting domain and much effort has been undertaken in recent years to overcome these problems @xcite . although many of the refinements which have been introduced are very efficient for a specific model system or a class of systems , they all suffer from the disadvantage of non - universality . the cycle expansion technique",
    "@xcite requires a completely hyperbolic dynamics and the existence of a symbolic code .",
    "the method is most efficient only for open systems , e.g. , for three - disk or @xmath1-disk pinball scattering @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the riemann - siegel look - alike formula and pseudo orbit expansion of berry and keating @xcite can only be applied for bound systems .",
    "the same is true for surface of section techniques @xcite and heat - kernel regularization @xcite .",
    "we will introduce high resolution spectral analysis , and in particular harmonic inversion by filter - diagonalization as a novel and _ universal _ method for periodic orbit quantization .",
    "universality means that the method can be applied to open and bound systems with regular and chaotic classical dynamics as well .",
    "formally the semiclassical density of states ( more precisely the semiclassical response function ) can be written as the fourier transform of the periodic orbit recurrence signal @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 the periodic orbit amplitudes and periods ( actions ) , respectively . if all orbits up to infinite length are considered the fourier transform of @xmath12 is equivalent to the non - convergent periodic orbit sum . for chaotic systems a numerical search for all periodic orbits is impossible and , furthermore , does not make sense because the periodic orbit sum does not converge anyway . on the other hand , the truncation of the fourier integral at finite maximum period @xmath13 yields a smoothed spectrum only @xcite .",
    "however , the low resolution property of the spectrum can be interpreted as a consequence of the uncertainty principle of the fourier transform .",
    "we can now argue in an analogous way as in the previous section that the uncertainty principle can be circumvented with the help of high resolution spectral analysis , and propose the following procedure for periodic orbit quantization by harmonic inversion .",
    "let us assume that the periodic orbits with periods @xmath14 are available and the semiclassical recurrence function @xmath12 has been constructed",
    ". this signal can now be harmonically inverted and thus adjusted to the functional form of the quantum recurrence function @xmath15 , which is a superposition of sinusoidal oscillations with frequencies given by the quantum mechanical eigenvalues of the system .",
    "the frequencies obtained by harmonic inversion of @xmath12 should therefore be the semiclassical approximations to the exact eigenenergies .",
    "the universality and wide applicability of this novel quantization scheme follows from the fact that the periodic orbit recurrence signal @xmath12 can be obtained for a large variety of systems because the calculation does not depend on special properties of the system , such as boundness , ergodicity , or the existence of a symbolic dynamics . for systems with underlying regular or chaotic classical dynamics the amplitudes @xmath10 of periodic orbit contributions",
    "are directly obtained from the berry - tabor formula @xcite and gutzwiller s trace formula @xcite , respectively .    as mentioned above the harmonic inversion technique",
    "requires the knowledge of the signal @xmath12 up to a finite maximum period @xmath13 .",
    "the efficiency of the quantization method strongly depends on the signal length which is required to obtain a certain number of eigenenergies . in chaotic systems",
    "periodic orbits proliferate exponentially with increasing period and usually the orbits must be searched numerically .",
    "it is therefore highly desirable to use the shortest possible signal for periodic orbit quantization .",
    "the efficiency of the method can be improved if not just the single signal @xmath12 is harmonically inverted but additional classical information obtained from a set of smooth and linearly independent observables is used to construct a semiclassical cross - correlated periodic orbit signal .",
    "the cross - correlation function can be analyzed with a generalized harmonic inversion technique and allows calculating semiclassical eigenenergies from a significantly reduced set of orbits or alternatively to improve the accuracy of spectra obtained with the same set of orbits .",
    "however , the semiclassical eigenenergies deviate ",
    "apart from a few exceptions , e.g. , the geodesic flow on a surface with constant negative curvature @xcite  from the exact quantum mechanical eigenvalues .",
    "the reason is that gutzwiller s trace formula and the berry - tabor formula are only the leading order terms of the @xmath0 expansion of periodic orbit contributions @xcite .",
    "it will be shown how the higher order @xmath0 corrections of the periodic orbit sum can be used within the harmonic inversion procedure to improve , order by order , the semiclassical accuracy of eigenenergies , i.e. , to obtain eigenvalues beyond the gutzwiller and berry - tabor approximation .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in chapter [ analysis ] the high precision analysis of quantum spectra is discussed .",
    "after general remarks on fourier transform recurrence spectra in section [ ft_spectra ] we introduce in section [ circumvent ] harmonic inversion as a tool to circumvent the uncertainty principle of the conventional fourier transformation @xcite . in section [ prec_check ] a precision check of the periodic orbit theory",

    "the method is introduced in section [ zeta_sec ] for a mathematical model , viz .  the calculation of zeros of riemann s zeta function .",

    "this is achieved by the high resolution spectral analysis ( harmonic inversion ) of cross - correlated closed orbit recurrence signals . for the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field",
    "we have obtained individual transition matrix elements between low lying and highly excited rydberg states solely from the classical closed orbit data .",
    "in summary , we have shown that harmonic inversion is a powerful tool for the analysis of quantum spectra , and is the foundation for a novel and universal method for periodic orbit quantization of both regular and chaotic systems .",
    "the high resolution analysis of finite range quantum spectra allows to circumvent the restrictions imposed by the uncertainty principle of the conventional fourier transformation .",
    "therefore physical phenomena can directly be revealed in the quantum spectra which previously were unattainable .",
    "topical examples are the study of quantum manifestations of periodic orbit bifurcations and catastrophe theory , and the uncovering of symmetry breaking effects .",
    "the investigation of these phenomena provides a deeper understanding of the relation between quantum mechanics and the dynamics of the underlying classical system .",
    "the high resolution technique is demonstrated in this work for numerically calculated quantum spectra of , e.g. , the hydrogen atom in external fields , three disk pinball scattering , and the circle billiard .",
    "theoretical spectra are especially suited for the high resolution analysis because of the very high accuracy of most quantum computational methods . in principle , harmonic inversion may be applied to experimental spectra as well , e.g. , to study atoms in external fields measured with the technique of _ scaled - energy spectroscopy _ @xcite .",
    "however , the exact requirements on the precision of experimental data to achieve high resolution recurrence spectra beyond the limitations of the uncertainty principle are not yet known .",
    "it will certainly be a challenge for future experimental work to verify the quantum manifestations of bifurcations , which have been extracted here from theoretically computed spectra , using real systems in the laboratory .",
    "we have also introduced harmonic inversion as a new and general tool for semiclassical periodic orbit quantization . here",
    "we briefly recall the highlights of our technique .",
    "the method requires the complete set of periodic orbits up to a given maximum period as input but does not depend on special properties of the orbits , as , e.g. , the existence of a symbolic code or a functional equation .",
    "the universality and wide applicability has been demonstrated by applying it to systems with completely different properties , namely the zeros of the riemann zeta function , the three disk scattering problem , and the circle billiard .",
    "these systems have been treated before by separate efficient methods , which , however , are restricted to bound ergodic systems , systems with a complete symbolic dynamics , or integrable systems .",
    "the harmonic inversion technique allows to solve all these problems with one and the same method .",
    "the method has furthermore been successfully applied to the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field as a prototype example of a system with mixed regular - chaotic dynamics .",
    "the efficiency of the method can be improved if additional semiclassical information obtained from a set of linearly independent observables is used to construct a cross - correlated periodic orbit sum , which can then be inverted with a generalized harmonic inversion technique .",
    "the cross - correlated periodic orbit sum allows the calculation of semiclassical eigenenergies from a significantly reduced set of orbits .",
    "eigenenergies beyond the gutzwiller and berry - tabor approximation are obtained by the harmonic inversion of the @xmath0 expansion of the periodic orbit sum . when applied , e.g. , to the circle billiard the semiclassical accuracy is improved by at least one to several orders of magnitude .",
    "the combination of closed orbit theory with the cross - correlation approach and the harmonic inversion technique also allows the semiclassical calculation of individual quantum transition strengths for atoms in external fields .",
    "periodic orbit quantization by harmonic inversion has been applied in this work to systems with scaling properties , i.e. , systems where the classical actions of periodic orbits depend linearly on a scaling parameter , @xmath31 .",
    "however , the method can even be used for the semiclassical quantization of systems with non - homogeneous potentials such as the potential surfaces of molecules .",
    "the basic idea is to introduce a generalized scaling technique with the inverse planck constant @xmath798 as the new formal scaling parameter .",

    "<S> harmonic inversion is introduced as a powerful tool for both the analysis of quantum spectra and semiclassical periodic orbit quantization . </S>",
    "<S> the method allows to circumvent the uncertainty principle of the conventional fourier transform and to extract dynamical information from quantum spectra which has been unattainable before , such as bifurcations of orbits , the uncovering of hidden ghost orbits in complex phase space , and the direct observation of symmetry breaking effects . </S>",
    "<S> the method also solves the fundamental convergence problems in semiclassical periodic orbit theories  for both the berry - tabor formula and gutzwiller s trace formula  and can therefore be applied as a novel technique for periodic orbit quantization , i.e. , to calculate semiclassical eigenenergies from a finite set of classical periodic orbits . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of periodic orbit quantization by harmonic inversion is the universality and wide applicability of the method , which will be demonstrated in this work for various open and bound systems with underlying regular , chaotic , and even mixed classical dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency of the method is increased , i.e. , the number of orbits required for periodic orbit quantization is reduced , when the harmonic inversion technique is generalized to the analysis of cross - correlated periodic orbit sums . </S>",
    "<S> the method provides not only the eigenenergies and resonances of systems but also allows the semiclassical calculation of diagonal matrix elements and , e.g. , for atoms in external fields , individual non - diagonal transition strengths . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is possible to include higher order terms of the @xmath0 expanded periodic orbit sum to obtain semiclassical spectra beyond the gutzwiller and berry - tabor approximation .    </S>",
