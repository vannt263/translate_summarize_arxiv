    "can singular matrix spaces _ other _ than compression spaces be used to obtain tighter upper bounds ( constructions ) on @xmath29 ? can the action of the affine group be used more systematically to find lower bounds on @xmath29 ?      finally , we have restricted our attention to matrices that , apart from being affine - linear in @xmath613 , are also affine - linear in the coefficients @xmath7 . our proofs give the same asymptotic behaviour ( with different constants ) if we require , in addition , that no quadratic terms @xmath614 may occur in @xmath11 .",
    "if , instead , we relax the condition that @xmath11 be affine - linear in the @xmath7 to a _ polynomial _ dependence on the @xmath7 , then the same bounds still apply ; see remark  [ re : poly ] .",
    "but what if we relax this to _ rational _ dependence of @xmath11 on the @xmath7 ?",
    "given that @xmath51 is only linear in the @xmath7 it seems unlikely that allowing @xmath11 to be rational in the @xmath7 we would gain anything , but we currently do not know how to formalise this intuition . on the other hand , in cases where a ( non - uniform ) determinantal representation of size @xmath1 is known to exist for every ( or sufficiently general ) polynomials of degree @xmath1 in @xmath1 variables ( e.g. , in the case of plane curves ) , it follows that this representation can be chosen to have entries _ algebraic _ in the @xmath7 .",
