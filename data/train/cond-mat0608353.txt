    "for example , new crystalline structures without known atomic analogue have been found  @xcite for mixtures of charged colloids .",

    "the colloidal particles then accumulate in the potential minima thus imposing a modulation of the colloid density .",
    "the competition between the attraction to the potential minima and the mutual repulsion of the particles can be conveniently controlled by adjusting the _ filling factor _ , i.e. , the number of colloidal particles per potential minimum .",
    "for instance , by changing the angles of incidence the lattice constant of the periodic modulation can be varied continuously .",
    "since the electrostatic interaction is usually screened by counterions in the solvent , the lattice spacing also sensitively determines how strongly particles interact . a second route to affect the balance between external compression and internal repulsion is by changing the intensities of the laser beams .",

    "enhancing the strength of the laser potential by an order of magnitude the response becomes highly nonlinear ; groups of three colloidal particles cluster in the close vicinity of each potential minimum . however , a significant number of _ defects _  groups of two or four colloidal particles  is still present in the system .",
    "since the filling factor has been adjusted to three , the number of four - groups equals the one of two - groups . in this regime the barriers separating minima become high and correspondingly single particle diffusion is strongly suppressed  @xcite , similar to a solid . although no thermodynamic phase transition has occurred the system is referred to as a _ molecular crystal_. a further increase of the external potential results in a freeze - out of the defects , i.e. , each lattice site is occupied by precisely three colloids .",
