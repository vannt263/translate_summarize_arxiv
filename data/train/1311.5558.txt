    "observations are a central source of knowledge on almost any entity in astrophysics . over several centuries of intense research",
    ", several principal observational techniques have been developed that are now routinely used to study stars and stellar populations in the milky way and other galaxies .",
    "we have information from astrometry , photometry , spectroscopy , but also interferometry , and astroseismology , that give complementary information on the physical parameters of stars ( detailed chemical composition , gravities , temperatures , masses and ages ) and their kinematics ( radial velocities , distances , and orbital characteristics ) .",
    "however , in contrast to e.g. cosmology , where sophisticated bayesian schemes are well  established ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , stellar parameter determinations are still widely based on best - fit estimates and simple averages between different methods .    the advent of large stellar spectroscopic and photometric surveys like segue / sdss @xcite , rave @xcite , apogee @xcite , gcs @xcite , and the gaia - eso survey @xcite , as well as astroseismic surveys like kepler @xcite , makes it necessary to develop fully automated methods for data analysis and determination of stellar parameters .",
    "standard spectroscopic inversion methods are commonly assumed to be accurate , however , they usually involve subjective and hardly reproducible elements , like line fitting and normalisation , or decisions on spectral diagnostic features .",
    "manual analysis of stars is limited to sample sizes of @xmath0 stars , unsuitable for large surveys .",
    "existing automated methods usually suffer from weakly constrained systematics as well as idealised error estimates .",
    "so far , most attempts to overcome these problems have concentrated on simple weighted averaging between different methods ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the large stellar surveys change stellar astronomy into a precision science , where we can not limit ourselves to pointing out structures in diagrams , but where knowledge of the error distributions is key to make meaningful model comparisons , e.g. of galactic evolution and stellar structure .",
    "the approach we need must be flexible , objective , applicable to very large datasets , and provide an optimal combination of the different bodies of observational data . the only mathematical apparatus known to permit a systematic combination of different quantities are bayesian frameworks .",
    "the first steps in this direction were made by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the scope and applicability of these studies is limited : they either addressed the problem of fitting a spectrum only @xcite , partly focussed on the problem of finding the maximum likelihood solution , or rely on simplifications of the observational likelihoods ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in part",
    ", this problem appears rooted in the introduction of `` observables '' , like effective temperature , ( see e.g. fig . 4 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which have no well - defined place in a bayesian approach and which are in fact just parameters constrained by another observation . in contrast , a bayesian scheme can only fulfil its claim of unbiased information , if a fair account of the observations is given and the full dimensionality of the constraints in parameter space is preserved .    in the following",
    "we will present a new method for the determination of stellar parameters that provides an optimal exploitation of different observational information .",
    "the method offers a homogeneous full - scale quantitative recovery of the full probability distributions in parameter space , which are given by the available observations , i.e. photometry , astrometry , spectroscopy , and well - established knowledge from stellar evolution theory and galaxy structure .",
    "the method is objective , computationally efficient , can be readily applied to data from all existing surveys and is robust to missing bits of data , e.g. damaged pixels in a spectrum or low - quality photometry . by embedding spectroscopic analysis directly in scheme ,",
    "the bayesian method allows for consideration of all pieces of relevant information at once , thus avoiding unnecessary information loss .    in this first paper of the series ,",
    "our main goal is to to determine effective temperature , surface gravity , metallicity , mass , age and distances of individual stars .",
    "thus , we limit the input data to spectroscopy , photometry , stellar evolution models and facultative parallax measurements .",
    "however , the method can be readily generalised to any number of parameters , such as kinematics or stellar rotation , and include other input information , e.g. astero - seismology and interferometric angular diameters .",
    "furthermore , it is straightforward to analyse star formation history of a whole stellar population , e.g. a young cluster or an old galaxy , using its integrated colours and spectra .",
    "thus the bayesian method has a very broad scope to applications both in the context of galactic and extra - galactic research .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sections 2 and 3 , we present the details of the algorithm and its implementation , illustrated on two examples . in section 4",
    "we apply the method to a sample of stars with very high - resolution observations and for a sub - sample of calibration stars from the sdss / segue catalogue .",
    "section 5 compares to the use of a simplified spectroscopic pdf .",
    "discussion of the algorithm and results and conclusions are found in the last two sections .",
    "so far , the majority of observational studies of stars , be it photometric or spectroscopic , have focussed on providing best - fit estimates of stellar parameters",
    ". however , accurate comparisons to theoretical models of e.g , galaxy evolution , require the full probability distribution of the derived parameters given the available observations .",
    "this demands a bayesian formalism . in this context",
    "we need to express the probability of a set of parameters @xmath1 given a set of observations @xmath2 by the probability that this observation could take place given the set of parameters . by definition the conditional probability @xmath3 , that @xmath4 given @xmath5 , derives from the combined probability @xmath6 as : @xmath7 .",
    "we can hence write down : @xmath8 where the _ posterior _ probability @xmath9 is the conditional probability of the parameter set @xmath4 given @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath10 , which we call _ observed likelihood _ , is the probability of making the set of observations @xmath5 given the set of parameters @xmath4 and @xmath11 is the prior probability we ascribe to that set of parameters .",
    "@xmath12 is the probability that the set of observations was made , which we set to @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this simplifies our problem to @xmath14 where @xmath9 is the posterior probability distribution function ( pdf ) on the chosen parameter space . in our work , observations are conditionally independent given the parameters , i.e. if all parameters are perfectly known , the observations do not provide additional information about each other . hence we can disentangle the observations by : @xmath15      the parameter set @xmath4 contains all parameters relevant to the problem under investigation and important to the description of a star .",
    "this may include surface and interior structure parameters ( effective temperature , surface gravity , mean density , etc ) as well as any other pieces of information like chemical composition , age , distance , position in the sky , etc .",
    "since we are dealing with a single object , all these parameters are related in some way .",
    "however , we can break their dependencies into main groups , using the fact that each type of observations constraints only a sub - set of these parameters , whereas it bears no information on others .    in this work",
    ", we define the core parameter space @xmath16 of metallicity ( expressed by iron abundance ) , effective temperature and surface gravity .",
    "the parameters in @xmath17 impact all our observations and models .",
    "other parameters are constrained by only a subset of observations : e.g. detailed abundances are of importance for spectroscopic observations , while stellar magnitudes in different colour bands @xmath18 span the space of the photometric parameters .",
    "age @xmath19 , initial mass @xmath20 and present mass @xmath21 fall into the domain of stellar models .",
    "distance @xmath22 and parallax @xmath23 are determined either from direct astrometric observations or via the distance modulus when comparing stellar models with photometry .",
    "thus the full parameter space can be disentangled into individual contributions : @xmath24 where @xmath17 is the core parameter space the other r@xmath25 are the parameters of importance to different types of observations or prior expectations ( see sec . 3.2 to 3.6 ) .",
    "in contrast to parameters , which span the n - dimensional space of the posterior probability distribution , the nature of observations is irrelevant .",
    "observations can be anything , from the numbers of electrons on a ccd to a needle on a scale .",
    "each observation puts a constraint on our parameter space , which is its corresponding observed likelihood @xmath26 as a function on parameter space .    instead of just writing down an observational likelihood ,",
    "the common approach in astronomy is to `` simplify '' this by the introduction of `` observables '' .",
    "while this term is not well - defined in a bayesian context , `` observables '' commonly denote best - fit values for some parameters ( like @xmath27 ) , which appear to be relatively well - constrained by ( single ) observations . some studies , like ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ) , go even further to introduce the errors on those `` observables '' as further variables in their formalism . from an aesthetic point of view , this results in a rather clumsy and complicated bulk of variables to achieve a simple goal : describing the real observed likelihood .",
    "it has two practical consequences .",
    "first , `` observables '' lead to an oversimplification of the observational likelihood , usually with the unjustified ( and damaging , see section  [ sec : gaussian ] ) approximation as a product of separate gaussians in each parameter termed `` observable '' .",
    "second , their introduction artificially introduces a `` better '' class of parameters , raising the wrong suggestion that their values are fixed .",
    "this is not true . for",
    "any parameter the bayesian formalism will in general give an estimate different from the best - fit value .    while selection functions are in most cases essential for understanding observations with theoretical models",
    ", this does not apply to the discussed bayesian schemes . yet",
    ", some studies introduce a selection function in their equations ( see a longer discussion in sec .  [",
    "sec : sf ] of the appendix ) .",
    "we refrain from using such a selection function , because only selection criteria based on the parameter space would affect the bayesian scheme , while a survey selection must be based on random choice or previous observations .",
    "to facilitate reading the equations we quickly summarize the main notations : we denote the set of observations by @xmath5 , the set of parameters by @xmath4 , the parameter space by @xmath28 and all probability distributions by @xmath29 . to cope with the different sources of information , we introduce indices : `` ph '' for photometry , `` sp '' for spectroscopy , `` astr '' for astrometry ( parallaxes ) , in addition we use `` mod '' for knowledge from stellar models and `` pr '' for priors . hence the observational likelihood in full parameter space from spectroscopic observations reads @xmath30 . to facilitate the reading we contract the notation for the conditional probabilities by decorating @xmath29 with a prime : e.g. @xmath31 .",
    "commonly used variables are age @xmath19 , stellar mass @xmath21 , solar mass @xmath32 , initial mass @xmath33 , logarithmic iron abundance @xmath34 , general metallicity @xmath35 , parallax @xmath23 , distance @xmath22 , and distance modulus @xmath36 .",
    "in this pilot study , we restrict ourselves to the most important basic case : the calculation of stellar parameters , when we have spectroscopic , and/or photometric observations .",
    "we will show how to expand this to include parallax measurements . after validating the method on the high - resolution spectroscopic data of nearby stars ,",
    "we apply it to a sample of low - resolution spectra from segue / sdss @xcite calibration sample .      with the conditional independence ( equation  [ eq : condimp ] ) we simplify the calculation of our posterior :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 denote the photometric and spectroscopic and astrometric observations , @xmath39 the probability derived from stellar models and @xmath40 the prior probability distribution function . in the second line we abbreviate our observational likelihoods , representing their conditional nature based on the observations in short by a prime .",
    "note that any combination of observational constraints can be dropped from these equations , as well as new observations ( e.g. interferometry ) can be added by multiplication .",
    "the pdfs from equ .",
    "[ eq : ar ] have two interesting qualities :    * some pdfs describe sharp structures in the n - dimensional parameter space , thus lowering the dimensionality of the probability distribution and reducing computational costs ( by the multiplication , the combined pdf can not have higher dimensionality than its components ) . in other words ,",
    "the space volume where their pdf is non - negligible has a lower dimensionality than the overall space .",
    "for example , stellar models together with model atmospheres map directly from the fundamental stellar parameters ( @xmath41 to their observed space ( @xmath42 ) . *",
    "some pdfs constrain only a subset of @xmath43 parameters , i.e. they are flat the other dimensions .",
    "though they can be generalised to the n - dimensional space of the aggregate pdf , most of these dimensions will be redundant , i.e. we have @xmath44",
    ". it can be efficient to merge them in an early step with another pdf that carries more dimensions .",
    "an especially valuable case are parameters that are nearly conditionally independent from the other parameters .",
    "e.g. the detailed abundances for the majority of chemical elements hardly affect temperature and gravity estimates .",
    "the meaning and structure of the single contributors to the posterior @xmath29 will be examined below .",
    "the priors encode our previous knowledge on the distribution of the examined stellar population in parameter space .",
    "the model knowledge @xmath45 will be treated here as a separate prior , though it could be in fact understood as an observation .",
    "appropriate priors are essential to avoid biases in weakly constrained data ( see for an example ) .",
    "further , to have set `` no prior '' means to have adopted a flat prior , which is not fixed under parameter transformations .",
    "however , priors must be handled with great caution to obey cromwell s rule ( avoid excluding any outcomes a priori * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and to avoid overconfidence biases and reproducibility problems .",
    "how can one cope with uncertainties in a priori parameter distributions ? making a prior just `` shallower '' or adopting a completely flat prior is not useful , since it actually adopts a worse probability distribution claiming the same certainty on this information as the original prior .",
    "however , one typically has estimates on how uncertain the distribution in a set of parameters is . if , within those uncertainties , the precise shape of a prior has important impacts on results , there are two strategies : the uncertainty of a prior can be constrained by demanding consistency with calibration data ( data of higher quality , where the prior has less impact ) and by imposing internal consistency between different subsamples ( e.g. red versus blue stars ) .",
    "the remaining uncertainty in a prior can be covered by hyper - parameters : the shape of the prior can be parametrised and a probability distribution function estimated on these parameters .",
    "there are strong dependencies between most parameters . as the posterior pdf has lower effective dimensionality than the parameter space @xmath28 , we can not set constraints on every single dimension in @xmath28 without risk of over - constraining the priors .",
    "we circumvent this problem by limiting our effective priors to age @xmath19 , initial mass @xmath20 , metallicity @xmath35 , and distance @xmath22 ; all other dimensions are indirectly constrained by these priors and we adopt no additional constraints on them .    throughout this work we will use the following priors : @xmath46},s )   \\sim \\\\ & \\sim & p(\\tau | { \\rm   [ fe / h ] } )   \\cdot   p(\\mi ) \\cdot p(s , l , b ) \\cdot p(\\meh , \\feh ) . \\notag",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath47 is a fixed relation between metallicity ( required for the isochrones ) and the iron abundance , which we have to introduce , since we do not measure detailed abundances in this paper . the adopted relation is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : amprior ] of the appendix .",
    "for @xmath48 we employ a salpeter imf @xcite , with exponent @xmath49 and independent from metallicity and age .",
    "we account for the metallicity - dependent age distribution by adopting a shorter timescale in the star formation history of metal - poor stars .",
    "details are given in the appendix .",
    "due to its importance we need to discuss the spatial prior @xmath50 . in general",
    ", every sample will cover some fixed angle on the sky ( be it so - called pencil beams like in segue or a complete sky coverage ) , so the actual volume is a cone that covers an effective area @xmath51 , where @xmath22 is the distance .",
    "the constant @xmath52 , given by the sky coverage and selection probabilities , is irrelevant in our context .",
    "however , the likelihood to end up in the sample is also proportional to the density of the population in the observed region , so that we obtain : @xmath53 where we integrate over the sky position @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is the spatial density of stars at position @xmath54 and distance @xmath22 . in our formulation , this must be multiplied by another factor of distance @xmath22 , since a fixed magnitude range samples a spatial depth proportional to @xmath22 ( formally this derives from a parameter transformation of the probability density from magnitudes to distance ) .",
    "neglect of this prior is not equivalent to a flat distance prior , but one that drops steeply with the third power of the distance , and hence in the absence of parallax measurements would give a strong ( and uncertainty dependent ) bias towards lower surface gravities .",
    "stellar models describe an effectively three - dimensional constraint in the full parameter space . the corresponding pdf can be represented in the core parameter space @xmath56 . in this work ,",
    "we neglect other dimensions , adopting a simple relationship for alpha enhancement and neglecting initial / present stellar rotation",
    ".    the calculation of the pdf is performed by summing the weights of available stellar model points falling into the cells of a dense grid in the target space @xmath17 . throughout this work",
    "we fold the models with a gaussian kernel with widths @xmath57 in @xmath58 .",
    "this error represents the internal uncertainty of the stellar models in parameter space and fills gaps caused by the discrete data representation .",
    "in addition , the effective width is augmented by the grid spacing on which the pdf is calculated .",
    "we use a dense grid of stellar isochrones from the basti database @xcite , kindly provided to us by s. cassisi for the stellar parameter determinations in @xcite .",
    "we interpolate the models in the initial mass @xmath20 to ensure a narrow mass spacing , but do not attempt an interpolation in age @xmath19 or metallicity @xmath35 .",
    "when summing over the isochrones , we assign to each point @xmath59 a weight @xmath60 proportional to the parameter space volume it represents : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the normalisation , @xmath63 is the average distance to its neighbours in initial mass , @xmath64 is the average distance in metallicity between the isochrone and its nearest neighbours , and @xmath65 is the average distance in age @xmath19 . on the boundary of the grid",
    "we take the distance to the neighbouring point .",
    "note that the approach is identical for stellar tracks instead of isochrones .",
    "the model probability at each point @xmath4 in our parameter space can then be represented as a weighted sum over all relevant models points @xmath59 : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the vector in parameter space given by the model grid . here",
    "we represent the uncertainty of the models by an n - dimensional gaussian @xmath68 with a dispersion vector @xmath69 .",
    "specifically , we assume @xmath70 on our core parameter space as above , and no additional uncertainties in the other dimensions .",
    "stellar models couple photometric colours with other parameters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details on the colour calibrations in sdss filters of basti models ) .",
    "thus we best calculate the photometric pdf simultaneously with the stellar models . denoting the stellar model magnitudes at model point @xmath59 and colour band @xmath52 by @xmath72 and the photometric observation in band @xmath52 with @xmath73",
    ", we have :    @xmath74    with distance @xmath22 and reddening @xmath75 .",
    "lacking sufficient data on the true pdfs , we represent the observational likelihoods of photometric colours , the reddening values and the model uncertainties by a gaussian @xmath76 , which enables us to combine them into : @xmath77 with the distance modulus @xmath78 , the reddening strength @xmath75 multiplied with the reddening vector ( for sdss colours , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in each colour @xmath79 , and with @xmath80 as the combined variance / uncertainty of models , observations and reddening .",
    "we assume a magnitude uncertainty on stellar models @xmath81 for the high - res sample , neglecting this term for the low - resolution sample .",
    "partly , @xmath82 covers the same uncertainties as our error term * @xmath83 * on stellar parameters ( see section [ sec : mod ] ) .",
    "we stress that this uncertainty can not and should not comprise systematic deviations in stellar models , as those uncertainties should be explored on a larger sample , using hyper - parameters as discussed in section [ sec : priors ] .",
    "the other assumption is the universal reddening vector .",
    "this may have to be relaxed when dealing with very different ism environments .",
    "the dust peak and the slope of the reddening spectrum can be shifted , or stars may be individually reddened , e.g. by a circumstellar envelope .",
    "we note that this method can be used to create reddening maps .",
    "since that is beyond the scope of this work , we restrict the sample to stars with relatively low reddening , use reddening values from other sources assuming a fractional reddening error of @xmath84 .",
    "the observational likelihood @xmath85 in eq . ( [ eq : ar ] ) incorporates all available spectral information .",
    "this comprises spectral type , element abundances , rotation , stellar activity ( chromospheric emission in cores of strong lines , magnetic effects ) , inter- and circum - stellar reddening , convection characteristics , etc .",
    "a spectrum offers by far the largest information content we can obtain on a star .",
    "however , this information is limited by incomplete physical knowledge and approximations in modelling the theoretical spectra . at present , calculations of large spectral grids are only possible with 1d hydrostatic codes assuming local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) , while full hydrodynamic 3d non - lte calculations are slowly becoming feasible @xcite .",
    "further , the high dimensionality of the problem forbids computing separate grids for all possible chemical compositions .",
    "here we use the mafags - odf @xcite grid of model atmospheres designed for late - type ( spectral type fgkm ) stars , with @xmath86 k , @xmath87 ,",
    "the synthetic spectra are computed with the revised version of the siu code @xcite , which has been extensively used during the past two decades for high - precision stellar spectroscopy ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we can thus more easily update it with more realistic physics .    for our grid of theoretical spectra",

    "* ) . such hard cuts and changes in assumed parameters will introduce anomalies in the derived pdf , as exemplified by the micro - turbulence cut at @xmath99 in . in total , the three - dimensional ( @xmath35 , @xmath27 , @xmath100 ) grid contains @xmath101 theoretical spectra and covers the full hrd , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : specstuff ] . any other model grid can be easily implemented , with no requirement on symmetry or shape , since our code includes a robust interpolation scheme .",
    "alternatively , one could perform calculations of line formation on the fly using a grid of model atmospheres .",
    "this latter approach is cleaner , however , it is still computationally too costly .",
    "we sample the wavelength windows around the spectral features important for diagnostic of fgkm stars : @xmath102   ( ca i lines ) , @xmath103  ( g - band , cn sensitive ) , @xmath104  ( @xmath105 ) , @xmath106  ( mg i triplet , main gravity diagnostics ) , @xmath107  ( @xmath108 ) , @xmath109  ( ca ii triplet , also used in gaia and in rave stellar survey ) .",

    "the gaia mission will derive parallax measurements for nearly all stars with spectroscopic information .",

    "this leads also to a tight correlation between metallicity and gravity as evident from the coloured dots in the bottom right panel .",
    "a moderate step in the spectroscopic pdf at @xmath164 is produced by a step in micro - turbulence in our current grid of theoretical spectra , which will disappear with the improved grids in preparation .",
    "the calculation does not cover the full allowed region of the spectroscopic pdf ( see the coarse behaviour at smaller gravities in the top right panel ) , saving computation time , since the joint pdf ( lower left panel ) is fully represented .",

[",
    "sec : datasets ] ) , the behaviour of our pdf is more interesting : the combined pdf is not even remotely a simple combination of its two contributors .",
    "most interestingly , the expectation value of the combined estimate is not situated between the estimates from each spectroscopy ( @xmath172 ) and photometry ( @xmath173 ) , but significantly higher ( @xmath174 ) .",

    "then , we first show the performance of the approach when limiting ourselves to photometric data with and without astrometry , followed by the full approach on low- and high - resolution spectra . in the last subsection we compare derived quantities , like distances and ages , and assess the resulting distribution of stars in the temperature - gravity plane .      for the high - resolution sample we obtained a comparison set of stellar parameters from @xcite .",

    "in addition , there are hipparcos parallaxes @xcite , making the sample closely resemble future data from gaia astrometry combined with gaia - eso spectroscopy .",
    "the sample is particularly valuable because the spectra were taken on different instruments and there are independent parameter determinations , including interferometric angular diameters and astroseismic surface gravities @xcite .",

    "we increased the errors in light of the general uncertainty of the sun s photometry to @xmath186 .",

    "for these stars , we have low - resolution segue spectra , ( @xmath178 ) , photometry in the sdss @xmath192 bands , @xcite reddening estimates and positional data from sdss dr9 @xcite .",
    "one star was removed from the sample , as it was flagged for strongly disagreeing observational information ( very low quality measure @xmath193 , cf .",
    "equation [ eq : qq ] , resulting partly from a strong cosmic in the spectrum ) . throughout the text",
    "we refer to the parameters from @xcite as `` ap08 '' and from segue dr9 as `` dr9 '' .",
    "two important remarks should be made about these comparison sets : while they are great tools for comparisons , they are subject to uncertainties and systematics that can exceed the quoted errors .",
    "second , the quoted errors are fundamentally different from ours .",
    "they just report internal errors from pipelines or spectroscopic fitting routines , which are typically far smaller than realistic error estimates .",
    "the most extreme case is the segue parameter pipeline .",
    "this is fundamentally different from our error calculations , which attempt to calculate all uncertainties .      before we explore the performance of the full algorithm against our reference samples , we test it for the simpler case , where spectroscopic information is not available .",
    "for the vast majority of stars in the galaxy , we will have no or very limited spectral information ( e.g. 4most will cover only of order @xmath194 of the stars in the gaia catalogues ) .",
    "however , we find that the bayesian method is capable of deriving stellar parameters also when restricted to photometric and astrometric information .    in , we compare temperatures , gravities and metallicities derived from johnson photometry and parallaxes only with our high resolution reference sample ( top row ) , and from sdss photometry alone with values from segue dr9 ( bottom row ) .    for the high - resolution reference sample ( top row )",
    "the applied photometry is not competitive with what can be expected from modern photometric surveys : for most stars we are restricted to johnson @xmath195 colours at @xmath196 precision , and , due to their brightness , very uncertain @xmath197 photometry .",
    "nevertheless , the photometry gives a good handle on effective temperatures : while our temperatures are mildly higher than the reference , the random scatter is as low as @xmath198 .",
    "the excellent agreement for @xmath199 is a consequence of using hipparcos parallaxes .",
    "we note that for most stars even uncertain parallaxes suffice to fix @xmath199 , as they constrain the stellar branch , i.e. whether a star is on the main - sequence or e.g. on the red giant branch .",
    "metallicities are per se very weakly determined with johnson broad band filters , and particularly without decent @xmath200-band measurements .",
    "the large uncertainties concentrate the values towards the centre of our grid .",
    "this underlines the need for intermediate or narrow band photometric surveys to constrain stellar parameters .",
    "the precise sdss photometry and the location of sdss colour bands allow for a better handle on metallicities , as well as for good temperatures . in absence of parallax measurements ,",
    "photometry alone offers a rough classification of stars , as seen in the bottom row of with a rms scatter against the segue parameter pipeline of around @xmath201 .",
    "while there is significant photometric information , it is not strong enough to be insensitive to the priors .",
    "this motivates a closer look at the importance of our assumptions .",
    "in we compare our photometric metallicities ( y - axis ) to the metallicities from @xcite ( x - axis ; for the standard segue dr9 comparison , see ) for the segue sample , plotting stars with clean photometry with larger discs and stars with bad photometry with smaller triangles .",
    "colours encode the error estimates from the bayesian method .",
    "evidently , there is enough information to constrain metallicities at least in the higher metallicity range to an accuracy of about @xmath202 .",
    "contrary to common derivations like @xcite , which fail at metallicities @xmath203 ( cf .",
    "* ) , our approach is valid throughout the entire metallicity range .",
    "however , it is important to realize how important the age prior becomes in this case . in the lower panel",
    "we show the same data with a fully flat age prior instead of using eq .",
    "[ eq : ageprior ] .",
    "this flat age prior implies a far larger uncertainty in the gravity of a star , which severely affects objects that can not be clearly identified as subgiants , or main sequence stars . via the degeneracy of @xmath204band information ,",
    "their potentially lower gravities allow for a wider range of ( mostly lower ) metallicities , which lowers the expectation values and boosts the error estimates . despite this problem , the situation is far better than in the traditional approach : the classical metallicity calibrations like @xcite or @xcite rely on stars falling not only on a fixed age bin , but also onto a single evolutionary sequence .",
    "this leads to a metallicity bias and overconfidence concerning the uncertainties .",
    "in contrast , the full bayesian approach makes optimal use of all available colour information , accounts for all sources of uncertainty and allows to explore the effects of prior assumptions .      shows the comparison of our parameter expectation values with the segue dr9 data release .",
    "colour codes the quality measure @xmath205 which gives a simplified indication on how well the spectroscopic pdf agrees with the remaining information .",
    "our temperatures are systematically colder than segue dr9 by about @xmath206 .",
    "this is a consequence of our spectral and photometric @xmath27 scales being @xmath207 and respectively @xmath208 colder , suggesting that segue dr9 overestimates stellar temperatures .",
    "our spectroscopic temperature scale is nearly identical with that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ap08 ) , which is on average @xmath209 below segue dr9 derivations .",
    "the strength of our full approach becomes apparent in the residual scatter of the temperature values after correcting for the systematic offset : while spectroscopic and purely photometric temperatures give a residual rms of @xmath210 and @xmath211 relative to segue dr9 , the full approach excels with @xmath212 .",
    "the bayesian gravities are systematically higher for suspected main sequence stars ( @xmath213 in both determinations ) , reflecting the systematic gravity underestimates of segue dr9 in this range ( also confirmed by segue not matching expectations for the main sequence ) .",
    "the purely spectroscopic gravities of our method are significantly lower than dr9 and ap08 by @xmath214 in the intermediate and lower gravity range ( using @xmath215 in ap08 ) .",
    "this is clearly identified as a bias , since the bayesian approach reports too young ages , especially for several metal - poor stars .",
    "though the bayesian approach can not completely eradicate a systematic bias in one of its inputs , it strongly reduces this problem by systematically increasing the surface gravities by an average of @xmath216 compared to the purely spectroscopic value .",
    "the bayesian metallicity determinations for @xmath34 between @xmath217 and @xmath218 are robust . however , metal - rich stars have a recognizable metallicity difference between our photometric and our spectroscopic determinations , with the latter being systematically lower .",
    "for the open cluster @xmath219 ( @xmath220 or @xmath221 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) our spectroscopy alone gives @xmath222 versus a photometric estimate of @xmath221 .",
    "as in the case of the gravities , the bayesian method partly mitigates this problem : photometric metallicities in this range push the combined estimates towards higher values ; however , due to the intrinsic uncertainty of @xmath202 , the corrections are minor .",
    "this also shows the importance of fair error assessment : overconfident , i.e. too small , error estimates from spectroscopy prevent a stronger correction of the value by the photometric information , which has intrinsic uncertainties of @xmath223 in this range .",
    "tests show stability of our results down to a signal to noise ratio of @xmath224 and checks on the continuum placement yielded no conclusive evidence .",
    "it is very likely that a finer resolution of the grid of synthetic spectra , its extension to a larger wavelength coverage of the segue spectral range . ] , and allowing for @xmath96-enhancement will solve the problem .",
    "this work is in progress and will be presented in a future paper dealing specifically with the analysis of segue spectra .    the most important result is , that even with systematic biases present in the inputs , the bayesian method itself remains robust , i.e. other parameters are not strongly affected , and the solutions are pushed towards a significantly less biased result .",
    "figure [ fig : res2 ] compares the reference parameters ( x - axis ) to the expectation values from our full bayesian analysis ( y - axis ) .",
    "again colours encode the value of the quality measure @xmath225 from equation [ eq : qq ] .",
    "we also give statistics in table [ tab : highrescomp ] .",
    "currently , our spectral grids do not cover stars with @xmath226 , @xmath227 and assume a slow stellar rotation of @xmath94 , which is typical for most g and k stars @xcite .",
    "hence , for the spectroscopic comparison sample we have to exclude stars with @xmath228 and drop the fast rotating stars @xmath229 bootis and @xmath36 leonis , which have @xmath230 and @xmath231 .",
    "we also remove @xmath185 hya due to contradictory results from different astroseismic derivations @xcite .",
    "this leaves @xmath232 stars with @xmath233 spectra .",
    "the two metallicity outliers at high metallicity in are @xmath234 and @xmath160 gem .",

    "this implies that only the astroseismic subset can match or exceed our precision , while the bayesian method is clearly superior to the traditional analysis on comparable data .",
    "some of the reference gravities were derived from hipparcos parallaxes , which should make them similar to our results . in this case ,",
    "our fully bayesian determinations in gravity appear more reliable than the less sophisticated reference because they also take into account physical information from colours and spectra .",
    "interferometric @xmath27 , although they are usually taken to be mildly model - dependent , still require an estimate of limb darkening and bolometric fluxes .",
    "the former are determined with 1d lte model atmospheres , while @xcite showed that 3d hydrodynamical models predict different centre - to - limb variation , which may cause systematic biases in angular diameter estimates .",
    "bolometric fluxes are estimated by interpolating between observed photometric magnitudes with the help of theoretical spectra , giving rise to another systematic uncertainty .",
    "it is instructive to compare the full method results to the spectroscopic results . in the bottom row of we show expectation values and parameter uncertainty from purely spectroscopic information ( green error bars ) and when using spectroscopy plus the model prior ( coloured points with blue error bars ) .",
    "spectroscopic surface gravities alone are generally too low by @xmath253 with a residual scatter of about @xmath254 compared to the full solution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for discussion of similar spectroscopic underestimates ) .",
    "using spectra in combination with stellar evolution models in the bayesian framework , but excluding the parallax and photometric information , improves the residual scatter to @xmath255 and fully removes the systematic offset .",
    "hence , while spectroscopic information alone can not compete with astrometric information , it gives sufficient information on surface gravity to allow for decent values derived by the bayesian framework .    in table",
    "[ tab : allhighres ] we provide the stellar parameters and ages from the full bayesian method .",
    "when more than one spectrum is present for a star , we provide the weighted average of the expectation values and errors ( we have to assume that the errors between the single determinations are highly dependent ) for single spectra .",
    "where no spectral information is available , we fill in the results from the combination of photometry and parallax measurements .      inspection of sample distributions in parameter space , like in the temperature - gravity planes shown in , provides clues about the reliability of each parameter determination . in this figure we show the hr diagrams in the @xmath256-plane with expectation values from the bayesian method ( top row ) , versus the reference parameters ( bottom ) , for both the segue sample ( left hand side ) and the high - resolution reference sample ( right ) . to facilitate the interpretation , we plot isochrones at @xmath257 and @xmath258 gyr at three different metallicities @xmath259 , matching the colour scale of the stars .",
    "the key differences between our results and those determined by conventional methods are obvious . despite the mildly biased spectroscopic gravity estimates ,",
    "our results show a clearly superior performance in this plot .",
    "the bayesian results cover the main sequence , while segue dr9 does not attain main sequence values .",
    "even more striking is the appearance of unphysical stars : both segue dr9 and the reference sample from heiter et al .",
    "have stars in highly unphysical positions , with the error estimates not even close to the offset from the nearest evolutionary sequence .",
    "e.g. both segue dr9 and the high - resolution reference sample place three stars around @xmath260 far right of the turn - off or respectively right of the main - sequence .",
    "the plot suggests that the gravity offsets between the high - resolution reference values and the bayesian method track back to a neglected metallicity effect in the reference sample . in principle",
    "the bayesian method could yield stars in between the sequences , since we here give expectation values .",
    "a hint of this tendency can be seen , but by construction our errors will correspond to the offset , because the actual likelihood at the unphysical points is near zero .    the resulting age - metallicity relation for the high - resolution sample",
    "is displayed in . to make the plot easier to read",
    ", we merged the entries for different spectra as in table [ tab : allhighres ] .",
    "the picture very much resembles the results of @xcite .",
    "the younger expectation values for one of the very metal - poor stars corresponds to a larger error estimate , forcing the expectation value away from the hard boundary given by the age of the universe .",
    "further there is no striking trend in metallicity at younger ages .",
    "the importance of a reliable assessment of all stellar parameters in one single approach is demonstrated in .",
    "here we plot the same stars from segue as in the top left panel of , but now colour coded with the estimated fractional distance error .",
    "it is apparent that even some very high gravity estimates are no guarantee for a good main sequence classification , vice versa stars with lower gravity can have high distance confidence .",
    "as expected , these stars are usually cleanly identified subgiants , giants , or even better , red - clump stars .",
    "while the distance and its uncertainty are in principle enough to support estimates of mean motion and velocity dispersions in a population , we point out that an investigation of velocity distributions themselves requires accurate estimates of the exact shape of the probability distribution in distance space , which the bayesian method can deliver .",
    "in this section we attempt to compare our implementation of spectroscopic information to an approximation by one - dimensional gaussian uncertainties . while this is certainly not the only point by which our algorithm differs from other studies in the literature , the simplification of the spectroscopic information is common to the works we are aware of .",
    "we perform this experiment on the segue sample . to degrade our spectroscopic results",
    ", we calculate the uncertainties @xmath69 and mean / expectation values ( @xmath261 , @xmath262 , @xmath263 ) of each quantity separately and then change the spectroscopic pdf to a product of one - dimensional gaussians in each parameter : @xmath264 where @xmath265 and @xmath158 is the normalisation .",
    "as we see from the spectroscopic pdfs in the top right panels of and the spectroscopic information can by no means be described as a product of gaussian errors in @xmath27 , @xmath199 , and @xmath34 separately : the pdf is not even remotely aligned with the coordinate axes and , for most stars we examined , shows a highly irregular shape .",
    "the top panel in shows the relative shifts between our full approach and the more conventional approximation in @xmath27 and @xmath199 for each star , normalised by the errors derived in our normal method , i.e. @xmath266    intuitively one might expect very small changes , because apart from approximating the spectroscopic pdf , we left all information untouched .",
    "the contrary is true , since the shape of the spectroscopic pdf gets distorted and now intersects the other constraints in parameter space at different locations ( this problem is aggravated with higher dimensionality of parameter space and a more irregular pdf ) .",
    "consequently the expectation values of the parameters scatter by more than @xmath267 .",
    "the failure of the `` classic '' approach can be seen in , where we plot the photometric , spectroscopic and photometric probability distributions for our full approach on the left versus the degraded approach on the right hand side .",
    "looking at the invoked difference in the spectroscopic pdf , which , more importantly does not carry any metallicity dependence , helps to understand the stark differences in the resulting parameters .",
    "the bottom panel in shows the errors in surface gravities from each approach .",
    "if the classic approximation produced robust error estimates , the values should scatter tightly around the @xmath268 line , instead there is only very weak correlation .",
    "the behaviour is a bit more benign in temperatures than in gravities and metallicities .",
    "while the diverse systematics indicate that our results are not perfect anyway , the big deviations both in the estimated values and their quoted uncertainties show that the traditional approach to the spectroscopic pdf does not provide a suitable approximation .",
    "thus , use of the full information is mandatory .",
    "the method presented in this work is essential for accurate determination of astrophysical parameters of stars .",
    "though the demonstrated scheme is essential to obtain accurate and objective error determinationsthe computational cost is affordable .",
    "the algorithm is parallelized and without efforts to make it more efficient took about @xmath232 cpu - minutes per star way to extract information from the current and upcoming galactic surveys , several shortcomings need and will be addressed .",
    "* we are working on extending the grids of stellar spectrum models , i.e. wider wavelength coverage ( uv to ir ) and finer grid resolution , inclusion of @xmath96-enhancement and rotation as extra dimensions in the grids . * especially on the low - resolution side , the continuum finding algorithms need to be improved . *",
    "parameters , like micro - turbulence , which in fact parametrise the deficits of the current 1d - models in physical realism , must be better constrained or best be made obsolete by the use of more physical models . in the short and intermediate range",
    "we will find smoother corrections on a denser grid that allow for more precise evaluation . in the far future , this problem should be solved by better physics , i.e. 3d - nlte calculations for stars , which are at present still too costly . * it is also interesting to include age- and mass- sensitive diagnostics ( such as , ca uv lines ) , that would in principle allow us to choose spectroscopic models which are more appropriate in a given domain of the hrd . at present",
    ", the analysis of oba stars relies on nlte model atmospheres , whereas lte models are standard for fgk stars .",
    "* the stellar evolution models still apply rather simplistic ( frequently grey ) atmosphere models .",
    "consequent systematics can be explored via residuals from this bayesian method e.g. in magnitude space , as well as aberrations of physical parameters .",
    "a long - term goal would be to gear the stellar evolution codes with the same atmosphere models used for the spectroscopic modelling to avoid biases by partly contradictory models . *",
    "the photometric information in our scheme is affected by reddening .",
    "colour distortions and mismatches between the photometric and other information can be directly used to determine reddening , in addition spectral information can be extracted at high resolution e.g. from interstellar na d lines .",
    "since we simultaneously derive probability distribution functions for stellar distances , the method can be adapted for reddening reconstructions ( like the ones by * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we present the first generalised bayesian approach for stellar parameter determination .",
    "the essence of the bayesian method is a combination of several probability distribution functions in the multi - dimensional parameter space , which can be expanded arbitrarily depending on a ) the available observational information for a star , and b ) the desired physical quantities .",
    "the presented framework simultaneously evaluates the spectroscopic informations ( gained from comparisons to theoretical spectra ) and all other sources of information .",
    "this allows to calculate the full probability distributions in parameter space and helps to cut computational costs by pre - constraining the parameter space that has to be searched with the spectroscopic method .    in this work",
    "we showed how to combine low or high - resolution spectroscopy , photometry , parallax measurements and reddening estimates to estimate central physical parameters @xmath269 of a star , as well as its mass , age , distance , or detailed chemical composition .",
    "the exploitation of theoretical constraints like stellar models , as well as strong mutual dependence or independence of different parameters reduce the complexity and effective dimensionality of the problem and make the computation possible .",
    "the scheme can be easily expanded to other sources of information , in particular to astroseismic e.g. from corot or kepler .",
    "the presented method has unique advantages compared to other available approaches :    * it makes an optimal and unbiased use of all observational data and theoretical information for a star , thus providing the parameter estimates that satisfy all observational constraints ; * the method is robust with respect to missing data , such as low quality or missing spectral or photometric information . * the method is vital to gain a grip on derived quantities .",
    "e.g. to determine the distance of a star , it is not sufficient to know its best - fit values for surface gravity , temperature , metallicity and their errors ; a fair assessment is only possible if we know the full combined pdf in all parameters .",
    "we showed that indeed the bayesian estimates in particular for uncertainties differ from simple expectations .",
    "* data from different surveys can be analysed with exactly the same scheme : stellar models are available in most photometric systems and the synthetic spectra grids can be folded with any instrument response function .",
    "this avoids systematic offsets caused by applying different analysis methods to different surveys and the bayesian method can serve as a benchmark for cross - calibration between surveys .",
    "we compared our approach to the results of a traditional bayesian analysis on the segue sample .",
    "we use the same photometric input , priors and even spectroscopic analysis , but approximate the spectroscopic pdf by a gaussian distribution , as usually done in the literature .",
    "we find substantial shifts in all parameters , frequently by several standard deviations .",
    "this demonstrates that neglect of the full pdfs leads to wrong parameter estimates and unreliable estimates of their errors .",
    "use of our or an equivalent method , which is able to map out the true shape of the full spectroscopic ( or any other ) pdf , is hence mandatory for any analysis of stellar parameters .",
    "the method requires unbiased assessments from all its sources of information . however , we know that systematic biases ( e.g. theoretical atmosphere flaws , stellar evolution uncertainties like convection , nuclear reaction rates , etc . ) currently affect these sources .",
    "this vulnerability can bias the entire derived parameter set . to test the performance of our method we compared both to reference samples for low - resolution and for high - resolution spectra . in all cases where we encounter problems ,",
    "e.g. lower spectroscopic gravities , the bayesian method remains robust and pushes all values towards the benchmark .",
    "comparisons with each astroseismically and traditionally derived parameters shows that the bayesian method provides excellent results on the astroseismic sample and clearly superior performance compared to the traditionally derived reference .",
    "we provide parameter estimations for these stars in table [ tab : allhighres ] .    similarly the photometric information is affected by reddening .",
    "however , this impact can be directly used to determine reddening especially in a larger sample . by the simultaneous determination of distance distributions",
    ", the method offers an excellent basis for reddening measurements similar to @xcite .    up to the last decade",
    ", sample sizes of galactic surveys determined the scope of model comparisons : at sample sizes of @xmath0 stars , poisson noise was usually of the same importance as systematic uncertainties and knowledge of the detailed error distributions . in the future we can advance from a more qualitative understanding of best - fit parameters for our galaxies to full quantitative analysis .",
    "the implies , however , that progress in evaluating the upcoming and present large stellar surveys for the milky way critically depends on our ability to cope both with the systematic biases and more importantly derive precise and accurate error distributions , and hence on the development and success of methods like the presented .",
    "we thank the referee for a very helpful report and for suggesting the comparison to the classical bayesian scheme .",

    "however , it is not clear why one should not use the full parallax information here : applying the selection function implies that one has the knowledge necessary to compute the full likelihood , the selection function instead gives an undesirable one - sided constraint against far - away stars , and when pretending not to have the parallax information for testing purposes , the selection function will arbitrarily cut away the tail of effective distance overestimates , leading to wrong confidence and biased error estimates .",
