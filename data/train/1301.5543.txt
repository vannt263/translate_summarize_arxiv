    "the tree - level graviton - higgs sector of the non - minimal higgs inflation model is described by ( [ onaction ] ) for the choices @xmath11 the matter sector of the model is given by the interaction part of the sm and can be described schematically as @xmath12 with the sums extending over scalar fields @xmath13 , vector gauge fields @xmath14 and dirac spinors @xmath15 .",

    ", we perform a transformation from the original field variables - denoted jordan frame ( jf ) parametrization - to the so called einstein frame ( ef ) .",
    "the name ef derives from the fact that expressed in this field variables , the action formally resembles the situation of general relativity ( gr ) minimally coupled to a scalar field .",
    "the field transformation from the jf to the ef involves a conformal transformation of the metric field , a non - linear transformation of the scalar field and a re - definition of the potential ( ef quantities are denoted by a hat ) @xmath34 all cosmological parameters can be expressed in terms of the ef effective potential and derivatives thereof @xmath35 moreover , it turns out that their behaviour is essentially determined by one single quantity - the inflationary anomalous scaling @xmath36 .",
    "the extra term @xmath37 is due to the quantum goldstone contributions contained in @xmath38 .",
    "however , calculating the quantum corrections is not sufficient .",
    "since we intend to connect two energy scale that are separated by many orders of magnitude , we have to take into account the dependence of the coupling constants on the energy scale .",
    "thus , we must calculate the beta functions and evaluate the renormalization group ( rg ) flow of the couplings from the electroweak scale @xmath39 up to the high energies @xmath25 during inflation @xcite .",
    "the beta functions form a complicated system of coupled ordinary differential equations that can only be solved numerically @xcite .",

    "although the allowed window ( [ higgsmassrange ] ) does not contain this value , it still comes remarkably close to it .. only the combination of many features including the rg running leads to values of @xmath41 close to the measured one .",
    "] moreover , the numerical result can be improved by including higher loops and ultimately leads to a shift of about @xmath44 gev bringing the lower bound of @xmath41 numerically very close to the measured value of @xmath41 , see e.g. @xcite .. as can be seen e.g. in fig .",

    "despite the appealing nature of this unified scenario and the encouraging numerical results , there still remain conceptual problems .",
    "some of these problems were addressed in @xcite , but probably the most fundamental and conceptually difficult problem is associated with the frame dependence of quantum corrections . while it is rather easy to see that the two formulations in the jf and ef are _ mathematically _ equivalent at the level of the classical action and the equations of motion , we are interested in the question whether this equivalence still holds at the quantum level .",
    "the problem is more general and arises in all theories with a non - minimal coupling , but it has in particular consequences for the non - minimal higgs inflation model as the beta functions that determine the rg flow are derived by the effective action . considering only the first quantum corrections , the question of frame dependence",

    "then we expressed the ef effective action in the jf parametrization and compared it with the jf effective action .",
    "we found that both results do not coincide @xcite .",
    "in order to understand the origin of this frame dependence , we have to embed our cosmological model into the more general setup of field theory .",

    "we can then describe a model by a single generalized field @xmath51 with the understanding that the einstein summation convention is extended to include integration over space - time .",

    "regardless of whether we are willing to accept these assumptions , there are several conclusions - independent of these assumptions - that can be drawn from the covariant reformulation and help to shed some light onto the cosmological debate .",
    "first of all , we notice that jf and ef are just two parametrizations among infinitely many others .",
    "it is also clear that the cosmological debate is just a very special case of the more general problem of parametrization dependence of the effective action .",
    "the analysis of the previous section shows why the off - shell results of the naive formulation of the effective action calculated in two different parametrizations do not coincide .",

    "we have at no point made use of the equations of motion . ] on - shell , the extra term in ( [ covdiffaction ] ) vanishes _ independently _ of @xmath73 , which is in agreement with the on - shell theorems that prove the parametrization independence of the s - matrix .",
    "having detected the origin of the frame dependence as the lack of covariance of the _ mathematical _ formalism , we can now turn to the discussion of the _ physical _ consequences . in the aforementioned cosmological debate often _",
    "physical _ arguments are given in favour or against one or the other frame . a popular argument that should serve to support the jf as the `` real '' or `` physical '' frame is the claim that we measure real physical distances and time intervals with the jordan frame metric .",
    ", this is only possible with respect to another dimensionful reference quantity @xmath74 .",
    "this reference quantity @xmath74 is build from units like kilogram , meter , seconds etc . in the cosmological context of the jordan frame the effective gravitational constant depends on @xmath75 . since @xmath24 is a scalar function that depends on space @xmath76 and time @xmath77 , it leads to a varying @xmath78 . consider for simplicity a homogeneous scalar field @xmath79 and imagine we would perform a cavendish - type experiment at two different times @xmath77 and @xmath80 in order to determine whether @xmath78 is time dependent or not .",
    "suppose that we would find @xmath81 .",
    "how can we say whether the gravitational constant @xmath82 has changed or whether the units ( or both ) have changed ?",
    "we simply can not !",
    "all we can say is that the _ ratio _ @xmath83 has changed with time . among the infinitely many parametrizations , jf and ef are distinguished in the sense that they correspond to the extreme cases where either @xmath78 or @xmath74 are constant . in the jf @xmath78",
    "is varying , while @xmath74 is constant and vice versa in the ef .",
    "] however , from the above considerations it should be clear once and for all that _ there is no distinguished physical frame_. it is pointless to talk about the _ physical _ meaning of one or the other frame in the same sense as it is meaningless to ask whether it is more physical to describe a mechanical system in spherical or cartesian coordinates . if we describe the same physical theory , the result will of course not depend on the parametrization as long as the formalism is covariant .",
    "some parametrizations may be preferred in the sense that they are more adapted to the symmetries of the underlying theory , but nature certainly does not care about how we parametrize her .",
