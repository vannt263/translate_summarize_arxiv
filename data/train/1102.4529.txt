    "after the birth of modern formal logic in the xix century many nonstandard logics were proposed , from heyting s _ intuitionistic logic _",
    "@xcite and ukasiewicz s _ many valued logic _",
    "@xcite to the recent _ relevance logic _ @xcite and _ linear logic _ @xcite .    in many cases these logics are interpreted as formalizing the features of notions of truth that are alternative to the classical notion of truth as correspondence formalized by tarski @xcite , and many logicians maintain that the _ plurality of logics _ should be considered as an important achievement of the xx century , which parallels the _ plurality of geometries _ which constitutes one of the revolutionary results of the mathematical research in the xix century .",
    "other logicians and philosophers instead uphold the thesis that nonstandard logics can be recovered as fragments of a suitable extension of classical logic ( cl ) , in a unified view ( _ global pluralism _ ) which restores the unity of logic and avoids many quarrels about the notion of truth @xcite . in this perspective , for instance , it has been proven that intuitionistic logic can be recovered as a part of a pragmatic extension of cl , intended to formalize the features of the notion of logical proof rather than the properties of an intuitionistic nonclassical notion of truth @xcite .    in the physical realm , many nonstandard logics were propounded after the birth of quantum mechanics ( qm ) @xcite .",
    "one only of them , however , acquired growing importance in the literature , that is , the quantum logic ( ql ) propounded by birkhoff and von neumann @xcite as the underlying logic of qm , now often called _ standard _ ( _ sharp _ ) _ ql_. this proposal indeed become rather popular because it seems to spring out directly from the mathematical formalism of qm . moreover , many scholars maintain that some known paradoxes of qm could follow from an improper use of cl for dealing with the basic notions of qm , for this theory would implicitly introduce a nonclassical notion of truth ( here , briefly , _ quantum truth _ , or _",
    "q  truth _ ) whose features are formalized by standard ql @xcite .",
    "hence a huge literature was produced on this topic , which is still flourishing nowadays .    also in the specific case of standard ql , however , one may wonder whether a perspective of global pluralism can be adopted which allows one to recover standard ql within an extended classical framework . in particular",
    ", it has been asserted several years ago that standard ql could be seen as the mathematical structure resulting from selecting a subset of sentences that are testable according to qm in the set of all sentences of a suitable classical language , that is , as the structure formalizing the features of the metalinguistic notion of _ testability _ in qm rather than a notion of q ",
    "truth @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to generalize and implement this view . to be precise we intend to illustrate a procedure for obtaining a _ concrete _ ( _ theory  dependent _ ) _ logic _ associated with a physical theory @xmath0 expressed by means of a classical language @xmath3 with a ( tarskian ) notion of truth as correspondence",
    "this procedure consists of four steps .",
    "\\(i ) consider an observational sublanguage @xmath2 of @xmath3 and introduce a derived notion of _ true with certainty _ on @xmath2 ( _ c  truth _ ) , defined in terms of classical truth but depending on @xmath0 .",
    "\\(ii ) define a _ physical preorder _",
    "@xmath4 on @xmath2 , induced by the notion of c  truth .",
    "\\(iii ) introduce a notion of _ verifiability _ in @xmath2 by selecting a subset @xmath5 of sentences of @xmath2 that are _ verifiable _ , or _",
    "testable _ , according to @xmath0 .",
    "\\(iv ) define a _ weak complementation _",
    "@xmath6 induced by @xmath0 on @xmath7 .",
    "the structure @xmath8 is then the required concrete logic .",
    "the above procedure is conceptually and philosophically relevant because it can explain the origins of some important nonstandard logics .",
    "indeed one can obtain different concrete logics by changing some of the three basic elements of the procedure , that is , @xmath0 , @xmath2 and the notion of verification .",
    "we illustrate our procedure in secs . [ linguaggio ] and [ physics ] by introducing a very simple observational ( pretheoretical ) language @xmath9 which is suitable for expressing basic notions and relations in a wide class of physical theories .",
    "then we consider two fundamental theories of modern physics , _",
    "i.e. _ , classical mechanics ( cm ) and qm .",
    "we obtain in sec .",
    "[ fisicaclassica ] a classical logical structure as the concrete logic associated with cm if all sentences of @xmath9 are considered verifiable ( in principle ) , as usual in cm .",
    "but we also prove by means of an example in sec .",
    "[ nonboolean ] that one can obtain a concrete logic that exhibits a non  boolean lattice structure in a macroscopic domain in which cm holds if one selects a suitable language @xmath2 and subset of sentences of @xmath2 that are considered verifiable .",
    "furthermore , we show in sec .",
    "[ meccanicaquantistica ] that , if @xmath0 is qm , our procedure allows one to recover standard ql as the concrete logic associated with qm ( up to an equivalence relation ) if a standard notion of verifiability according to qm is adopted .",
    "finally we compare in the last part of the paper ( sec . [ quantum_logic ] ) our procedure for obtaining standard ql with the orthodox procedure that introduces standard ql without making reference to classical truth @xcite , and show that the latter implies adopting implicitly a _ verificationist _",
    "( hence theory dependent ) definition of truth , while truth and verification are carefully distinguished in our approach .",
    "let us add now some comments and remarks on the results resumed above .",
    "firstly , we observe that our approach does not conflict with _ logical localism _",
    "@xcite , for it entails that many nonstandard logics can be obtained , depending both on the theory @xmath0 and on the notion of verifiability that is considered .",
    "nevertheless it also supports global pluralism , because it implies that different concrete logics can coexist without contradicting classical logic .",
    "secondly , we note that our procedure has to cope with an important objection .",
    "indeed , a quantum physicist could argue that it recovers standard ql in a classical framework in a purely formal way because qm can not be expressed by a classical language . more specifically",
    ", he would observe that we associate a set with every property of a physical system ( the _ extension _ of the property ) whose elements are interpreted as individual examples of the system possessing the property , while such a set can not be defined according to the orthodox interpretation of qm .",
    "physical properties are in fact _ nonobjective _ according to this interpretation , which means that the set of individual examples of the physical system in a given state that display a given property whenever this property is measured depends on the set of measurements that are actually performed and is not prefixed ( hence one can not say that these examples `` possess '' the property before the measurement ) .",
    "to overcome this objection , we preliminarily note that our formal derivation of standard ql is interesting anyway , for it is usually maintained that any derivation of this kind is impossible .",
    "more important , the objection vanishes if one accepts the point of view of some alternative interpretations of qm in which objectivity of physical properties is recovered .",
    "in particular , an extensive criticism of the theorems that aim to prove the _ contextuality _ and the _ nonlocality _ of qm ( mainly the bell  kochen  specker @xcite and the bell @xcite theorems ) , hence nonobjectivity of physical properties , has been carried out by some authors who have shown that the proofs of these theorems implicitly introduce an epistemological assumption which is problematic from the point of view of qm .",
    "if this assumption is relaxed , the proofs can not be completed @xcite .",
    "basing on this conclusion , a new theoretical proposal called _ extended semantic realism _ ( esr ) _ model _ has been recently worked out .",
    "the esr model reinterprets quantum probabilities as conditional on detection rather than absolute and embodies the mathematical formalism of qm into a broader formalism which admits a local and noncontextual physical interpretation @xcite , recovering objectivity of physical properties .",
    "if this new perspective is accepted , our present deduction of standard ql is not purely formal because its basic elements are provided with a physical interpretation .",
    "thirdly , we note that we recover standard ql in this paper by introducing semantic restrictions induced by qm on a classical language and then defining new derived quantum connectives whose semantic interpretation is provided by qm .",
    "it is then possible to show that an equivalent approach to standard ql can be constructed by pragmatically extending a classical propositional logic by means of pragmatic connectives , following @xcite , and then interpreting these connectives in terms of the quantum notion of _ empirical proof _ ( which is equivalent to the notion of verification according to qm that is introduced in this paper ) .",
    "we conclude by noticing that the elementary observational sublanguage @xmath9 introduced in this paper takes into account only pure states and physical properties ( exact effects ) and does not contain logical quantifiers , to avoid clouding the conceptual aspects of our approach with technical complications . in principle , however , it can be extended to take into account mixtures and effects and express general empirical laws .",

physical entity @xmath98 that is a point particle @xmath185 that can move on the surface of a sphere , denoted @xmath186 , with center @xmath187 and radius 1 .",
    "vector @xmath188 where the particle is located on @xmath186 represents the state @xmath189 of the particle (  ) . for each point @xmath190 , we introduce the following measurement @xmath191 .",
    "we consider the diametrically opposite point @xmath192 , and install a piece of elastic of length 2 , such that it is fixed with one of its end ",
    "points in @xmath193 and the other end  point in @xmath192 .",
    "once the elastic is installed , the particle @xmath185 falls from its original place @xmath188 orthogonally onto the elastic , and sticks on it (  ) . then the elastic breaks and the particle @xmath185 , attached to one of the two pieces of the elastic (  ) , moves to one of the two end ",
    "points @xmath193 or @xmath192 (  ) . depending on whether the particle @xmath185 arrives in @xmath193 (  ) or in @xmath192 , we give the outcome @xmath194 or @xmath195 to @xmath191 .",
    "we can easily calculate the probabilities corresponding to the two possible outcomes .",
    "therefore we remark that the particle @xmath185 arrives in @xmath193 when the elastic breaks in a point of the interval @xmath196 ( which is the length of the piece of the elastic between @xmath192 and the point where the particle has arrived , or @xmath197 ) , [ where @xmath198 is the angle between @xmath193 and @xmath188 ] and arrives in @xmath192 when it breaks in a point of the interval @xmath200 ( @xmath201 ) .",
    "we make the hypothesis that the elastic breaks uniformly , which means that the probability that the particle , being in state @xmath189 , arrives in @xmath193 , is given by the length of @xmath196 divided by the length of the total elastic ( which is 2 ) .",
    "the probability that the particle in state @xmath189 arrives in @xmath192 is the length of @xmath200 ( which is @xmath202 ) divided by the length of the total elastic .",
    "if we denote these probabilities respectively by @xmath203 and @xmath204 we have : @xmath205 these transition probabilities are the same as the ones related to the outcomes of a stern  gerlach spin measurement on a spin @xmath206 quantum particle ,  '' . _",

    "thus one can construct @xmath2 by enlarging @xmath9 by means of predicates denoting unsharp properties ( for which axiom cm2 does not hold , hence the physical preorder does not coincide with the logical preorder in @xmath2 ) .",
    "it is then apparent that aerts considers as verifiable sentences of @xmath2 only sentences that are logically equivalent to atomic sentences containing predicates that denote unsharp properties .",
    "this implies that the concrete logic that is obtained in this case is not a boolean algebra .",
    "indeed , aerts results entail that it is isomorphic to the ql of a spin@xmath206 quantum particle , hence to the modular orthocomplemented lattice of all subspaces of @xmath211",
