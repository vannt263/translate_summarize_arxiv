    "it is by now established  @xcite that about 23% of the constituents of the universe are composed of dark matter ( dm )  @xcite .",
    "however , its nature remains unclear . a well - motivated candidate for dm",
    "is the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , which must be stable , nonrelativistic , electrically neutral and colorless .",
    "if the wimp mass is from a few gev to tev while their interaction strength is of the weak scale , they can naturally yield the observed relic density of dm  @xcite .",
    "although there is no stable wimp in the standard model ( sm ) , wimp candidates exist in various theoretical models trying to solve the sm problems at the weak scale , such as supersymmetric models @xcite , extra dimensional models  @xcite , little higgs models @xcite , left - right symmetric models  @xcite , and some other models ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the specific models mentioned above are very attractive , but still lack experimental support .",
    "the well - running lhc experiment may find some important signals of these models in the near future .",
    "however , if other new particle species are all so heavy that the dm particle is the only new particle within the reach of lhc , it will be very difficult to know which model the dm particle belongs to .",
    "in addition , it is possible that the dm particle may be first observed by direct or indirect detection experiments .",
    "these early observations may only provide information about some general properties of the dm particle , and may not be able to distinguish the underlying theories .",
    "therefore , the model - independent studies of the dm phenomenology can play an important role as they may avoid theoretical bias @xcite .",
    "recently there have been quite a few papers to study various phenomenologies related with dm in the model - independent way  @xcite . especially the relic density measured by wmap  @xcite , direct detection from cdms  @xcite and xenon @xcite , and possible collider signals from tevatron ( e.g.  @xcite ) and from lhc ( e.g. @xcite )",
    "are considered in these studies .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we investigated a general set of 4-fermion operators for the effective interaction between the spin-1/2 fermionic dm and the sm particles , and gave the phenomenological constraints from the observed dm relic density , the direct detection experiments by cdms and xenon , and the indirect detection of the @xmath2 ratio by pamela  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the constraints from different observations are quite complementary . besides the possibility of spin-1/2 wimps , it is also possible that dm is composed of scalar , vector , or spin-3/2 wimps , which belong to different representations of lorentz group . in these cases ,",
    "the forms of possible effective operators are different .",
    "these differences may lead to distinguishable phenomenological results . in this work",
    "we extend our previous analysis to the cases of scalar , vector and spin-3/2 dm .",
    "we will consider a general set of 4-particle operators up to dimension 6 for the effective interaction between the wimps and the sm fermions and compute their phenomenological constraints .",
    "we will use the updated limit of xenon100 si direct detection @xcite , which is stronger than that adopted in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sections [ sec - scal ] and [ sec - vect ] ,",
    "the effective models of scalar and vector dm are discussed , respectively . in the subsections of these two sections",
    ", we explore the constraints on these models from the dm relic density , direct and indirect detection searches and the validity of effective theory , and then present the combined constraints on the effective coupling constants of these models . in section [ sec-3/2 ] , the study on the effective models of spin-3/2 dm are carried out briefly .",
    "the conclusions are given in section [ sec - con ] .",
    "let us begin with the case that dm consists of complex scalar wimps ( @xmath3 and its antiparticle @xmath4 ) .",
    "we will add remarks when there is a notable difference between this case and the case of real scalar wimps . in order to study phenomenologies in a model - independent way",
    ", we construct effective interaction operators between the wimps and the sm particles .",
    "these interaction operators are limited only by the requirements of hermiticity , lorentz invariance and cpt invariance .",
    "we make the following assumptions similar to those in ref .",
    "@xcite : ( 1 ) the wimp is the only new particle species at the electroweak scale , and any other new particle species is much heavier than the wimp .",
    "this implies that the thermal relic density of the wimp is not affected by resonances or coannihilations .",
    "thus it is possible to describe the interaction between the wimps and the sm particles in terms of an effective field theory .",
    "( 2 ) the wimp only interacts with the sm fermions through a 4-particle effective interaction of @xmath4-@xmath3-@xmath5-@xmath6 type , but not with gauge or higgs bosons . for simplicity , this interaction is assumed to be dominated by only one form in the set of 4-particle operators .",
    "( 3 ) the wimp - antiwimp annihilation channels to the sm fermion - antifermion pairs dominate over other possible channels .",
    "in other words , the possible channels to final states that include gauge or higgs bosons are assumed to be negligible .",
    "the effective interaction term of lagrangian between two complex scalar wimps ( @xmath3 and @xmath7 ) and two sm fermions ( @xmath6 and @xmath8 ) is given by only one of the following expressions : @xmath9 where the sum of @xmath6 is over all the sm fermions , the symbol @xmath10 is short for @xmath11 , that is , @xmath12 , and the effective coupling constants @xmath13 are real - valued numbers .",
    "@xmath13 have mass dimension of @xmath14 for the dimension-5 operators ( s and sp ) , and that of @xmath15 for the dimension-6 operators ( v and va ) .",
    "we do not consider operators with more derivatives on the fields since these operators have higher mass dimensions such that they are more suppressed at low energy scale .",
    "note that for the case of a real scalar wimp , the wimp vector current @xmath16 vanishes so that the v and va effective operators vanish , leaving only the s and sp interactions . since @xmath13 are real - valued , the transformation properties of the 4-particle operators , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 under c , p and t are the same as the corresponding 4-fermion operators of ref .",
    "all the operators are cpt invariant .",
    "each form of the interaction operators listed above describes an effective model in which the wimps couple to the sm fermions . for each case",
    ", we will calculate the corresponding annihilation and scattering cross sections , which depend on the wimp mass @xmath21 and the coupling constants @xmath13 .",
    "associated with the recent experimental results of the dm relic density , direct and indirect detection experiments , the phenomenological constraints on @xmath13 can be derived , respectively .",

    "the indirect detection constraints also rule out the wimp with @xmath145  gev for s and sp interactions , while the constraints becomes much weaker for v and va interactions .",
    "the reason is that for v and va interactions the annihilation rate and are of order @xmath146 , which lead to looser bounds by indirect detection because of the much lower wimp temperature today comparing with that of the wimp freeze - out epoch",

    "although spin-3/2 field theories suffer from a common problem of non - renormalizability , it is safe to consider effective field theory below an appropriate energy cutoff . following the assumptions in sections [ sec - scal ] and [ sec - vect ]",
    ", we construct the effective interaction operators of @xmath212-@xmath213-@xmath6-@xmath6 type between the wimps and the sm fermions as follows , @xmath214 where the sum of @xmath6 is over all the sm fermions , and the effective coupling constants @xmath215 are real numbers with mass dimension of @xmath15 .",
    "since each component of @xmath206 looks like a dirac spinor , the s , p , v , a , t1 , t4 , sp , ps , va and av interactions are analogous to the s , p , v , a , t , @xmath154 , sp , ps , va and av interactions defined in our previous work on dirac fermionic wimps  @xcite , respectively . even though the spin-3/2 fermionic wimp has more degrees of freedom , it is not important in the calculation of phenomenological constraints",
