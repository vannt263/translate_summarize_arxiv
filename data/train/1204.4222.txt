    "almost 40 years ago @xmath0 t hooft proposed the large @xmath1 expansion for strongly coupled gauge theories in the seminal paper @xcite .",
    "this suggested that the large @xmath1 limit of gauge theories would be a type of string theory , however it was not for many more years that this observation would start to bare significant fruit with the advent of the ads - cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "the correspondence is a weak coupling to strong coupling duality which , in its best understood form , relates @xmath2 sym to type iib string theory on an @xmath3 geometry ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "developments in integrability on both sides of the correspondence @xcite have shown that it stands up to many no trivial tests and by now it is a well trusted , if not formally proven , tool used to probe the strong coupling dynamics of both gauge and string theories .",
    "despite its robust nature the original ads - cft correspondence gives a gravity dual of a gauge theory with maximal susy and conformal symmetry with only adjoint fields .",
    "@xmath2 super yang - mills is not much like yang mills so for phenomenological reasons it was desirable to extend the idea to include non - conformal theories with minimal susy or even no susy at all .",
    "this form of gauge gravity correspondence certainly stands on less stable ground but the belief is that , none the less , it gives useful insights into strongly coupled dynamics .",
    "the canonical example of such a gravity dual is the maldacena - nunez solution @xcite which is conjectured to be dual in the infra red to pure @xmath4 sym in @xmath5 dimensions",
    ". a great deal of work has been done on this background so as to give a dual that describes minimal sqcd in @xmath5 dimensions as closely as possible .",
    "a major step was to add fundamental matter , the method by which this is achieved consists of adding flavour branes to the gravity dual , which is equivalent to including an open string sector , and was proposed in @xcite .",
    "massless fundamental flavours were added to the maldacena - nunez solution , first in the quenched approximation where the number of flavour branes is small enough to neglect their back - reaction @xcite , and later in the in the unquenched veneziano limit , where @xmath1 and @xmath6 are taken to be infinite but their ratio is finite @xcite@xcite .",
    "this was implemented by means of a smearing procedure , proposed in @xcite@xcite , in which the flavour branes are continuously distributed across their common co - dimensions .",
    "unfortunately most gravity duals with massless unquenched fundamental matter are afflicted by non physical ir singularities .",
    "the problem is that massless flavours correspond to branes that reach the origin and so an infinite number of back - reacting branes can give rise to infinite curvature in the ir .",
    "this was resolved for @xmath5-dimensional sqcd in @xcite , by giving the branes a density profile which increases from @xmath7 to @xmath8 as one flows from the ir to the uv , a more phenomenologically motivated approach was proposed in @xcite but both are equivalent to adding massive fundamental matter .    in this paper the goal is to continue a parallel story , that of gravity duals which flow in the ir to @xmath4 sym in 3-dimensions where it is also possible to have a chern - simons term of level @xmath9 .",
    "the original dual was proposed in @xcite but was found independently by maldacena and nastase in @xcite soon after , where the interpretation is clearer .",
    "it consists of d5 branes which are extended along the space time directions and wrap a non compact 3-cycle inside a manifold of @xmath10-holonomy , the solution is reviewed in .",
    "this was conjectured to be dual to the 3-dimensional @xmath4 yang - mills chern - simons theory which was studied by witten in @xcite .",
    "witten calculated the index of this theory and showed that for @xmath11 the theory exhibits a single confining vacuum .",
    "massless fundamental flavours were added to the maldacena - nastase solution by canoura , merlatti and ramallo in @xcite .",
    "they found two distinct classes of uv consistent with the 3-dimensional ir , those with an asymptotically linear dilaton and those with a asymptotically constant dilaton where the metric approaches a deformed @xmath10-cone .",
    "this solution is reviewed in appendix [ massless ] while the procedure for adding unquenched flavours is reviewed in .",
    "the massless flavour background suffers from the ir pathology common to these backgrounds and in fact an ir expansion has not been found . in this paper massive fundamental flavours",
    "are added to the maldacena - nastase background and we find a solution that interpolates between the deformed unflavoured background and the massless flavoured backgrounds of @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by introducing a profile function @xmath12 that depends on the holographic coordinate . to determine a suitable @xmath12 we use the more phenomenologically motivated methods of @xcite because lacking the partial integration of the bps equations that so drastically simplifies the 4 dimensional case , it is not clear how to proceed in the more formal fashion of @xcite .",
    "recently a solution generated method called `` rotation '' has been introduced @xcite .",
    "this is a powerful technique that , starting from a relatively simple type - iib supergravity solution with characterised by an @xmath13 structure , enables a more complicated iib solution to be generated , often with different field content .",
    "this technique can be applied to the deformed maldacena - nunez solution of @xcite and generates the baryonic branch @xcite deformation of klebanov - strassler @xcite . in @xcite gaillard and martelli introduced a new avatar of rotation which can be implemented on type - iia supergravity solutions . after an s - duality , this is applied to the massive flavour deformation of the maldacena - nastase solution to generate the @xmath10 analogue of the baryonic branch of klebanov - strassler , but with a profile .",
    "the lay out of the paper is as follows : an ansatz for the massive flavour gravity dual is laid out in which is shown in to lead to a non - singular ir .",
    "the asymptotic series solutions for this system are consistent deformations of both the unflavoured and massless flavour cases in the appropriate limits which shows that an interpolation between both is possible . in a profile",
    "is proposed on phenomenological grounds to achieve this interpolation and we explore some of the consequence of the addition of massive flavour on the dual field theory in . the rotation is described then implemented in , where we also attempt to get a handle on the likely form of the field theory dual .",
    "finally the work is summarised and comments made in",
    "the holographic dual of @xmath14 dimensional @xmath4 super yang mills was found by maldacena and nastase in @xcite and is based on the 5d supergravity solution of @xcite which can be lifted first to 7d then to 10d .",
    "the maldacena - nastase background is generated by @xmath1 @xmath15 branes that wrap a non compact 3-cycle inside the internal space , which is a manifold of @xmath10 holonomy . in the ir",
    "the the supergravity theory reduces to the @xmath14 dimensional theory considered by witten in @xcite .",
    "this theory includes a chern - simons coupling @xmath9 and has a unique ground state if @xmath16 . in this section",
    "we review this holographic dual , the notation we use is based on that of @xcite .",
    "the 10-d metric in einstein frame is expressed , setting @xmath17 , as : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) are su(2 ) left invariant 1-forms which obey the following differential relations : @xmath22 and the 1-form gauge field @xmath23 is given by : @xmath24 this type iib supergravity theory has a non trivial rr 3-form : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the 2-form field strength of @xmath27 : @xmath28 and @xmath29 is a 3-form chosen such that @xmath30 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath29 satisfies : @xmath31 and so h must take the value : @xmath32 from the prospective of , @xmath33 is an integration constant , however it is in fact related to the chern - simmons coupling , @xmath34 .",
    "the value of @xmath33 can be determined by the fact that the pull back of @xmath35 onto the cycle on which the color branes are wrapped must vanish in the ir for the background to be non singular . in what follows it",
    "is useful to introduce , as in @xcite , the following holographic coordinate : @xmath36 the cycle must shrink to zero as @xmath37 , which defines the ir , so that we are left with fractional d2-branes there . as pointed out in @xcite",
    "the appropriate cycle is : @xmath38 which has the following induced metric : @xmath39(\\sigma^i)^2\\ ] ] clearly @xmath40 for @xmath41 as long as the dilaton is finite at the origin as @xmath42 .",
    "the pull back of @xmath43 on @xmath44 is given by : @xmath45 thus clearly @xmath43 vanishes on @xmath44 for all values of the holographic coordinate provided @xmath46 in the ir the two 3-spheres should be manifestly disentangled so that it is possible to factorise the directions parallel and orthogonal to the brane volume in a well defined way .",
    "the mixing of the spheres is controlled by the gauge field @xmath23 , such that if it becomes zero the spheres are manifestly separated .",
    "it is easy to show that when @xmath47 the field strength of @xmath23 is vanishing which implies that @xmath23 is pure gauge and can thus be set to zero via a suitable gauge transformation .",
    "this confirms the choice : @xmath48 the solution to this theory is given , in the ir , by the following expansion of background fields @xmath49 and @xmath50 : @xmath51 in @xcite it was shown that there is in fact a family of backgrounds related to the maldacena - nastase solution .",
    "if we generalise the metric with a deformation such that @xmath52 and instead of the choices of 1-form in we take : @xmath53 from which it follows that @xmath29 is now given by @xmath54 so that the cycle defined by is still vanishing in the ir it is clear that @xmath55 must be a finite constant which shall be referred to as @xmath56 . with the ir conditions we have thus far derived",
    "it is simple to show ( the details are in @xcite ) that @xmath57 must also satisfy the following for a finite dilaton : @xmath58 then this set - up solves the bps equations and supergravity equations of motion with the following ir expansions of the background fields in terms of @xmath59 : @xmath60 the maldacena - nastase solution is just the special case given by @xmath61 were @xmath62 . the ir of this family of backgrounds , which will henceforth be referred to as deformed maldacena - nastase , is non - singular with any finite choice of @xmath56 .",
    "from the perspective of a gravity dual , @xmath6 unquenched flavours can be added to a gauge theory by the addition @xmath6 flavour branes .",
    "these flavour branes are fundamentally different from their color brane counterparts .",
    "the @xmath1 coincident color branes give rise to an @xmath63 gauge symmetry and are converted into a flux . while the @xmath6 coincident flavour branes produce an @xmath64 global symmetry , these branes will back - react on the geometry of the unflavoured system and modify the metric , bps equations and equations of motion .",
    "massless flavours are given by branes that reach the origin of the holographic coordinate , while massive flavours by branes which do not .",
    "usually the @xmath6 flavour branes will be stacked on top of each other with dirac - delta functions representing their positions in their co - dimensions , this makes the process of finding a back - reacted geometry computationally difficult .",
    "a method of getting round this is to use a smearing procedure @xcite@xcite@xcite that de - localises the branes and gives solutions that depend on a single holographic coordinate ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the smearing procedure means that the branes are no longer coincident in their co - dimensions and so generically the global symmetry is broken @xmath65 .",
    "a major advantage of the smearing procedure is that it lends itself well to the application of the powerful techniques of calibrated geometry @xcite ( see @xcite for a review and @xcite for several examples in the context of smeared flavours ) .    to add flavours to the maldacena - nastase background ( see ) we need to add d5-branes that fill the @xmath66 minkowski dimensions and wrap a non compact 3-cycle in the internal space extending along the radial direction .",
    "these flavour branes are smeared with the smearing parametrised by a 4-form @xmath67 .",
    "the action of this theory will be composed of 2 parts , that of type iib supergravity and that of flavour branes respectively : @xmath68 @xmath69 includes contributions from both a dbi and a wz term .",
    "provided the flavour brane , with embedding @xmath70 , satisfies the super symmetry condition : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the induced metric on the brane , the flavour action can written as a 10-dimensional integral in terms of the smearing form @xmath67 and calibration 6-form @xmath73 of the flavour brane as : @xmath74 the calibration 6-form can be expressed in terms of the g-2 structure form , @xmath75 as @xmath76 @xmath75 and the vielbein basis are defined in and respectively .",
    "@xmath73 has the same form for both massive and massless flavours ( and in their absence ) but it will give rise to different bps equations because of the difference in definitions of the rr 3-form and metric .",
    "the type iib action , @xmath77 , contains a term of the form : @xmath78 from and the equation of motion for @xmath79 can be obtained .",
    "it gives rise to a maxwell equation for @xmath80 : @xmath81 at this point we recall that in the einstein frame the 3 and 7-form field strengths are related by @xmath82 .",
    "thus the addition of massive flavours leads to the following violation of bianchi identity of the rr 3-form : @xmath83 we use as our definition of the smearing form .",
    "so when we wish to add flavour to a background we must modify the rr 3-form to account for this .",
    "in this section we add massive fundamental flavours to the maldacena - nastase solution .      in this section",
    "we will propose an ansatz for the massive flavour gravity dual of 3-dimensional , @xmath4 gauge theories .",
    "we use the same metric ansatz as massless flavour case , namely : @xmath84 but choose a more general ansatz for the rr 3-form : @xmath85 the 1-forms @xmath23 and @xmath27 are still defined by and , using this , the 2-form field strength of @xmath27 can be written explicitly as : @xmath86 the forms @xmath87 and @xmath88 are our flavour deformation forms parametrizing the violation of the bianchi identity .",
    "we chose , as in @xcite , an ansatz which parallels @xmath89 and @xmath29 : @xmath90 the components of @xmath43 which differ from the massless case , , are the following : @xmath91 where v is modified to : @xmath92 from the last line of we can see that for @xmath93 and @xmath94 we almost reproduce the massless flavoured theory of @xcite , but spoils this . as we seek a dual to a theory where flavours become massless in the uv this clearly must be reconciled .",
    "the first step is to choose : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a constant .",
    "this allows to reduce to for @xmath97 but also gives the correct term in the flavourless limit @xmath98 provided @xmath99 as in .",
    "this is consistent as we require the theory flows to the deformed maldacena - nastase background in the ir .",
    "the uv expansions of @xcite will only be reproduced when @xmath100 ( see appendix [ massless ] , however the bps system in appendix [ bps ] is consistent for any value of @xmath96 and , for reasons that will become apparent later in this section , it shall be kept arbitrary for now .",
    "the bps equations impose a restriction on @xmath101 , , which implies that @xmath102 .",
    "so there is only one function , @xmath103 , that parametrises the flavour deformation .",
    "let us define a profile function , @xmath104 , that we want to interpolate between @xmath7 and @xmath8 as we run from the ir to the uv : @xmath105 the ansatz now depends only on the original background fields and @xmath12 . , but we still have an arbitrary constant @xmath96 that we need to fix .",
    "this can be archived if we consider the pull back of the rr 3-form , defined in , onto various 3-cycles in the geometry .",
    "@xmath35 obeys the flux quantisation condition , @xmath106 , @xmath107 where the angles are defined between @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the 3-sphere parametrised by @xmath20 and we set @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "this is of course also true for both the massless flavour and flavourless theories as can be readily seen if we consider the pull - back of @xmath43 onto @xmath112 : @xmath115 which , being independent of the profile function must hold for all values of @xmath12 , in particular @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "the pull back of @xmath35 onto the shrinking cycle @xmath44 ( ) , on which the color branes are wrapped , will still vanish in the ir .",
    "however in general , unlike the deformed maldacena - nastase solution , it will no longer vanish over the whole range of the holographic coordinate @xmath59 .",
    "the pull back onto @xmath44 is given by : @xmath118\\sigma^1\\wedge \\sigma^2\\wedge\\sigma^3\\ ] ] this confirms that , as with deformed maldacena - nastase , we must have that @xmath99 .",
    "we could choose @xmath100 at this stage to impose that vanishes for all @xmath119 and , as previously stated , we would reproduce the uv expansions of @xcite when @xmath117 . while this may seem attractive , it is not required for the background to be ir finite as @xmath120 .      performing the integral over @xmath121 then gives the chern - simons level , which may be calculated by setting @xmath117 , @xmath100 in .",
    "but as @xmath6 always appears with @xmath12 in the massive case this can not be quantised ] : @xmath136 this is not the whole story . as pointed out in @xcite , in the flavourless ( @xmath116 ) case , there are 6 dimensional kaluza - klein modes giving rise to massive adjoint gluinos . in the ir",
    "these will be integrated out and induce a shift of @xmath137 in @xmath132 . as we have no fundamental matter in the ir , this shift will be reproduced in the massive flavour case . so that in the 3 dimensional chern - simons term will be given by : @xmath138    it is worth pointing out that we could relax the requirement that @xmath132 is everywhere quantised .",
    "if we do nt fix c we are led to @xmath139 .",
    "this is of course quantised in both the ir and the uv , with @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "it is only in the intermediate region that @xmath132 becomes dependent on @xmath142 and there is a field theory interpretation for this .",
    "as we flow from the ir the dependence on @xmath142 causes an increase in @xmath12 which can be interpreted as increasing the energy of the dual field theory such that the effects of quarks running in loops becomes increasingly noticeable . when @xmath117 the energy is high enough that the full effect of flavours running in loops is visible , the flavours are effectively massless and @xmath132 is once more quantised but now dependent on @xmath6 .",
    "the difference in the @xmath143 and @xmath144 is then a shift induced by integrating out the massive flavours .",
    "this is an attractive picture , indeed one expects the chern - simons level to depend on @xmath6 when the quarks run in loops and the shift in @xmath132 could be a sign of the parity anomaly in @xmath14 dimensions .",
    "one reason we have chosen to instead impose that @xmath132 is quantised over the whole range of r is that it is the only way to fix @xmath96 .",
    "another reason is that in a solution generating technique is applied to the solution we consider here .",
    "this technique seems to generically generate solutions in which the sources no longer act as flavours@xcite@xcite .",
    "thus the picture of a change in level due to integrating out massive flavours is invalid in that case . at any rate it seems that the qualitative results of the following sections are insensitive to the choice of @xmath96",
    "indeed , there exists asymptotic solutions to the differential bps equations , , for arbitrary @xmath96 that are ir finite .",
    "the numerical analysis performed in and has been repeated with @xmath100 ( which leads to the uv of @xcite ) and @xmath145 with very similar results .    with the constants determined as @xmath135 and @xmath99",
    "we can now explicitly write @xmath146 in terms of @xmath12 .",
    "we use to write : @xmath147 where for @xmath99 , @xmath135 , @xmath148 reduces to a comparatively simple form : @xmath149 it only remains now to calculate the smearing form , @xmath67 .",
    "taking the exterior derivative of we can express this in terms of @xmath12 as : @xmath150 \\end{split}\\ ] ] the first term is present in but the other 2 are new dependent term @xmath151 , but for @xmath135 this is zero .",
    "the other terms only depend on @xmath96 through @xmath148 and potentially @xmath12 . ]",
    "it is now clear that both the unflavoured and massless flavour background are special cases of this more general background .",
    "in particular reduces to the smearing form of the massless theory , , when @xmath117 .",
    "the ansatz laid out in this section defines a set of bps equations that are derived in appendix [ bps ] . in @xcite",
    "it was proven that for general type ii backgrounds with calibrated brane sources , the source - corrected einstein and dilaton equations of motion follow automatically from the bps equations once the likewise source - corrected form equations of motion and bianchi identities are imposed .",
    "the flavourless limit of our background is the deformed maldacena - nastase solution for which it was shown in @xcite that the bps equations imply that the supergravity equations of motion are satisfied .",
    "therefore we know that for our background the supergravity equations of motion are satisfied .",
    "gives a set of bps equations in terms of an arbitrary profile function @xmath12 .",
    "we seek solutions to the bps equations that in the ir will be given by but will tend to either or in the uv .",
    "the profile function @xmath12 should interpolate between 0 and 1 as we run from the ir to the uv .",
    "formally its precise form will depend on the specifics of the brane embedding as is the case for the dual @xmath4 sqcd with massive flavours , @xcite .",
    "however from a phenomenological point of view we might choose any @xmath12 that interpolates between 0 and 1 and obeys some consistency requirements .    to begin with",
    "let us keep p general and seek asymptotic expansions .",
    "the only restrictions we shall impose is that @xmath152 $ ] , that p has a minimum in the ir , a maximum in the uv and that it is monotonic .",
    "this is the general idea advocated in @xcite . as proposed in @xcite , we will attempt to find series solutions to the bps equations in terms of the holographic coordinate @xmath119 .",
    "thus if we define : @xmath153 where we have that : @xmath154 we can use the bps equations to eliminate @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "so the following set of differential equations give the bps equations in terms of the holographic coordinate @xmath119 : @xmath157 where @xmath158 and @xmath159 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath160 are defined by and is used to eliminate the dependence on @xmath161 and @xmath162 in favour of @xmath163 and @xmath119 .",
    "it is in fact only the first 3 differential equations in that are coupled , once they are solve @xmath164 need only be integrated .",
    "we expect , as in @xcite , that for @xmath165 the ir of the theory corresponds to @xmath166 . for we expect that @xmath167 @xmath119 is no longer such a good holographic coordinate and the theory will be harder to interpret . sadly , as with the massless case ,",
    "an analytic solution to valid over the whole range of @xmath119 will not be possible to derive and we will have to satisfy ourself with series solutions in the ir and uv that we will then numerically match . although the series presented in the following sections are for @xmath135 there also exist similar series leading no ir singularity for arbitrary @xmath96 .      now that the ir boundary conditions have been determined and we have fixed the integration constant , @xmath33 it is possible to solve as a series expansion about @xmath168 . at this stage",
    "we will keep the discussion general and propose the following arbitrary ir form for the profile .",
    "this also leads to sensible results , but with more complicated solutions to the bps equations so these extra terms have been omitted here ] : @xmath169 where there is no constant or linear term so that the profile vanishes and has a minimum at the origin .",

    "in the previous section we showed that any choice of @xmath12 that is monotonically increasing from 0 to 1 as @xmath119 runs from 0 to @xmath180 and which reduces to and in the appropriate limits will give a background that is free from ir pathologies .",
    "so it seems that a possible choice for @xmath12 is the following : @xmath181 where @xmath182 is an integer . as can be seen from fig .",

    "it also has the correct form of ir and uv expansion .",
    "for @xmath184 we get : @xmath185 the choice of @xmath12 given by will correspond to a brane configuration concentrated around the maximum of @xmath186 which we take as a measure of the common quark mass @xmath187 . as shown in fig . , @xmath187 gets larger with @xmath188 which in turn implies that the range over which there is effectively no flavours increases with @xmath188 also the width of the brane distributions becomes quite large and the idea that most of the quarks in the system have mass @xmath187 becomes invalid ] .",
    "the uv limit , where the quarks become effectively massless , is defined by @xmath189 while the ir limit is given by @xmath190 , where there are no massive flavours .",
    "it turns out that @xmath184 is a good choice for the theory ( see ) . in the next section",
    "it is confirmed that it is possible to numerically match the ir and uv expansions of with this choice of @xmath12 .         in order to numerically integrate the bps system we must make a concrete choice of profile .",
    "somewhat presciently we choose : @xmath191 as the numerics work well for this choice .",
    "it is now possible to check whether our ir and uv boundary conditions give a solution to the bps equations that is smooth and continuous over the entire range of the holographic coordinate @xmath119 .",
    "the standard method employed to achieve this is to use mathematica ( or some other program ) to numerically solve the bps system .",
    "this will give interpolating functions for the background fields which will be valid between @xmath192 and some finite upper bound @xmath193 .",
    "the numerical solutions from mathematica can then be compared to the semi - analytic solutions defined in terms of series about the ir and uv boundaries . if the numerical and semi - analytical results coincides over a significant range of the holographic coordinate we can then say , with confidence , that our background is well defined over the whole space , despite having",
    "not rigorously proved this .",

    "we see that the semi - analytic and numerical solution do indeed overlap and as can be seen in fig .",
    "the dilaton does become linear for large @xmath119 . in fig .",
    "there is a numerical plot of an asymptotically constant dilaton for @xmath194 and @xmath195 , the corresponding numerical background fields are shown to match their semi - analytic counterparts in .",

    "@xmath56 needs to be highly fine tuned to match the ir expansions with the asymptotically linear dilaton uv . if @xmath56 is increased from this fine tuned value there are many numerical solutions that give asymptotically constant dilaton backgrounds and far less tuning is needed to match ir expansions to the uv expansions .",
    "we conclude that we have a background that in the ir is the deformed maldacena - nastase background of and in the uv is the massless flavour background of appendix [ massless ] . with the choice of profile defined in",
    "we have shown that it is possible to smoothly interpolate between the two , so our background is well defined .",
    "in fact numerical matching does not seem to depend on the choice of @xmath96 in , indeed the cases @xmath100 and @xmath145 have been checked .",
    "now that we have a well defined background , at least numerically , we should start to analyse the specifics of the dual field theory . in this section",
    "we shall concentrate on the solutions with an asymptotically linear dilaton .",
    "some of the details are clearly going to be the same as the massless case considered in @xcite .",
    "in particular for @xmath196 the yang - mills coupling @xmath197 in the ir ( @xmath190 ) of the theory and @xmath198 in the uv ( @xmath199 ) which is what we expect form a confining theory with asymptotic freedom term in the action of a space time filling probe d5 brane wrapping @xmath44 as in @xcite ] .",
    "for @xmath200 the location of the ir and uv of the theory in terms of @xmath119 is opposite ( uv is @xmath190 and vice - versa ) , in this case the authors of @xcite inferred that this theory developed a landau pole in the uv .",
    "the case @xmath196 is both the easier to interpret and the more phenomenologically interesting so it is this we shall concentrate on here .",
    "we would like to show that the dual field theory exhibits confinement in the ir and and confirm asymptotic freedom in the uv , at least for @xmath165 .",
    "to this end we shall use our supergravity solution to calculated the expectation value wilson loops in this section . for an arbitrary path @xmath201 a wilson loop",
    "is defined by the following gauge invariant equation : @xmath202 which is the path - ordered exponential of the gauge field @xmath203 . in this section",
    "we shall calculate two such wilson loops , the rectangular loop and the circular one .    in euclidean space the expectation value of a rectangular wilson loop",
    "is related to the quark - antiquark potential @xmath204 .",
    "if a rectangular loop , in the @xmath205 plane , is defined by @xmath206 and @xmath207 then in the limit @xmath208 the relation is given by : @xmath209    in @xcite maldacena argued that in order to calculate a wilson loop from a gravity dual one should consider a minimal surface attached to the loop that extends from the uv into the ir .",
    "if this surface has symmetry such that its parametrisation is effectively 2-dimensional we need only minimise the nambu - goto action for an open string with ends fixed in the uv .",
    "the quark - antiquark potential is then extracted from the minimal nambu - goto action through the identification @xmath210 .",
    "if we choose to parametrise the world sheet of the string by @xmath211 then for @xmath212 and @xmath213 the induced metric in the sting frame is given by : @xmath214\\ ] ] and so the nambu - goto action is given by : @xmath215 because there is no explicit dependence on @xmath216 in integrand we do nt need to derive the second order equations of `` motion '' but can use the first integral formula to derive the following first order o.d.e : @xmath217 where @xmath218 and @xmath219 is the distance of the lowest point of the string from @xmath168 .",
    "from here it is a simple matter to derive an expression for l as a function of @xmath219 : @xmath220 and for the energy of the string as a function of @xmath219 : @xmath221 where the last term in is present because we need to subtract the contribution to the energy from strings that stretch straight from the uv to the ir . in both and",
    "formally we should take @xmath222 , however since we can not do this numerically it is necessary to take a finite upper bound to plot graphs .",
    "in there are graphs of @xmath204 as a function of @xmath223 derived numerically , we can see that for the massive flavour theory we no - longer have the cusp which appears in the massless case . in fig .",
    "we have linear behaviour for large l and it appears that what was interpreted as string breaking due to pair production of quarks in @xcite is a symptom of the ir singularity of the massless background .",
    "there are two distinct scales in this theory , in the uv the potential exhibits an inverse power law and in the ir where quarks have been integrated out and the theory has the confining behaviour of deformed maldacena - nastase . fig .",
    "explicitly shows the first order phase transition between these regimes .",
    "this behaviour , as described in @xcite , is what we expect in a theory with two scales , and was first observed in the context of wilson loops in theories with massive flavour in @xcite .    to confirm the numerical results we should perform some analytic calculations to determine the precise relation between @xmath204 , @xmath223 and @xmath219 , @xcite lays out a procedure to do this .",
    "our goal is to exploit the exact differential relation derived in @xcite and which takes the following form for our background : @xmath224 this will only be helpful for the asymptotic values of @xmath119 where , as shown in , we have analytic solutions to the background fields in terms of series .",
    "the lowest contribution to is of the form : @xmath225 which is clearly infinite .",
    "the upper limit of the integral is given by : @xmath226 this shows that that @xmath223 becomes infinite as @xmath227 provided @xmath228 , so that the upper bound is finite and can not cancel the infinite contribution from the lower bound .",
    "the expression can now be inverted to give us @xmath229 which then enables the integration of , giving the result : @xmath230 this linear behaviour supports the assertion that the dual qft is confining .",
    "we now turn our attention to the circular wilson loop , its expectation value is once more extracted from the nambu - goto action of an appropriately parametrised string . in euclidean space the induced string frame metric of a string constrained to end on a circle in the field theory coordinates for @xmath231 is given by : @xmath232\\ ] ] where the bracketed part is the metric of an arbitrary circle in @xmath133 . if we choose to parametrise the string world sheet by @xmath233 and make the reasonable assumption that it has no angular dependence we are led to the following action : @xmath234 this action explicitly depends on @xmath119 so there is no first integral equation and because our background is not ads we are unable to call upon the power of conformal transformations to make the sort of simplification performed in @xcite .",
    "instead we must calculate by brute force .",
    "is minimises by the following differential equation : @xmath235 this equation is complicated so we must resort to solving it numerically . with @xmath233",
    "determined the expectation value of the loop can be ascertained .",
    "once more we need to renormalise to subtract the contribution from strings that stretch straight along @xmath119 .",
    "so if we call the radius of the circular wilson loop @xmath236 its expectation value is expressed in terms of the following corrected action : @xmath237 in there is a numerical plot of the action of the circular loop as a function of its radius , a. for large a the graph becomes quadratic , which it should to be consistent with the result for rectangular loop . to verify this",
    "we preform another semi analytic calculation .",
    "first note that if we chose to parametrise in terms of @xmath238 , then integrand of the action is given by : @xmath239 the approximation on the rhs is good when we consider loops that probe the deep ir .",
    "this is because the minimal surface attached to such loops will be close to cylindrical . upon integrating the approximation we arrive at an area law : @xmath240 this is consistent with result for the rectangular loop .",
    "indeed we have now shown that in both cases the expectation value of the large loop only depends on the area the loop encloses : @xmath241 thus we conclude that the dual gauge theory exhibits confinement in the ir .",
    "we have shown that we have a good supergravity dual of a qft with a confining ir , in fact through the semi analytic calculations , we have shown that this is true for any profile consistent with the criteria of which is a robust result .",
    "it should be noted that the qualitative results of this section seem not to depend on the choice of @xmath96 in , indeed a detailed study has confirms this for @xmath145 and @xmath100",
    "in @xcite gaillard and martelli present a solution generating method which gives a new type - iia supergravity solution in terms of a simpler one .",
    "it is an algorithm often referred to as a `` rotation '' as this is how it acts on the space of killing spinors . in this section",
    "we will apply this rotation to the solutions thus far presented in and ) . as these are for type - iib",
    ", we will have to make use of s - duality along the way .",
    "first however we should familiarise ourselves with how the rotation works .",
    "in @xcite the 11-dimensional supergravity set up of @xcite is dimensionally reduced to give a metric and supersymmetry conditions for a type - iia supergravity with an interpolating @xmath10 structure structure of @xcite , not in the sense of a flavour profile ] preserving @xmath4 susy on fractional ns5 branes .",
    "it has a warped metric given , in the string frame , by : @xmath242 where @xmath243 is a manifold of @xmath10 holonomy .",
    "this background is augmented by two non trivial fluxes , @xmath244 and @xmath245 , in addition to a function @xmath246 that acts as a phase .",
    "the supersymmetry conditions for this system are expressed in terms of the following differential relations involving the , yet to be determined , g - structure form , @xmath75 , which is a 3-form : @xmath247 this is clearly going to lead to a set of highly none trivial differential bps equations which will be difficult to solve directly .",
    "this is why it is advantageous to employ a solution generating method such as rotation .",
    "it is easiest to elucidate the connection between and maldacena - nastase with massive flavours by considering the limit @xmath248 .",
    "the susy conditions truncate dramatically , now @xmath249 and the 4th equation implies @xmath250 , at least up to a constant which can be set to zero through a redefinition of @xmath50 . we are left with : @xmath251 the only non zero flux is now @xmath245 and if we choose @xmath252 to be : @xmath253 we are in fact left with the s - dual of our original d5 brane set up . to be precise ,",
    "is the string frame , s - dualised versions of and .",
    "the key point of the rotation procedure is that it is possible to find a solution of , for any @xmath246 in terms of , where @xmath246 is zero to some other arbitrary value . ] .",
    "if @xmath254 , @xmath255 and @xmath256 solve then we can define : @xmath257 where the quantities denoted by a hat will satisfy the first 3 equations in .",
    "the 4th equations is solved when the final relation holds and @xmath258 , @xmath259 are integration constants .",
    "the fluxes can then also be written in terms of the unrotated quantities and the whole system can be written as : @xmath260 any solution to , with the appropriate bianchi identities for the fluxes , will be a solution to the type - iia supergravity equations of motion .",
    "the bianchi identities for the rotated system follow immediately form the unrotated solutions @xcite , thus finding a solution of implies a new rotated solution of the form .      with the rotation procedure laid out we would now like to apply it to the maldacena - nastase with massive flavours to generate a new @xmath4 type - iia solution .",
    "thus far we have dealt only with type iib with a non trivial rr 3-form in the einstein frame .",
    "the rotation works for type - iia in the string frame with ns 3-form , but this is easily reconciled .",
    "we change to the string frame via @xmath261 and then if we perform an s - duality , it will map the theory into the common type ii ns - sector .",
    "the maps are as follows : @xmath262 thus will lose its warp factor and we are left with a string frame metric precisely of the form in . with the appropriate substitutions in it is possible to express the new type - iia solution in terms of the unrotated type - iib solution as : @xmath263 here the hodge dual is now taken with respect to and @xmath258 , @xmath259 are integration constants .",
    "we can express these as : @xmath264 this enables us to relate the rotation to the following chain of transformations : a lift to m - theory , rescaling the 11th dimension by @xmath265 , a boost along @xmath266 with parameter @xmath267 , undo the rescaling of @xmath266 , reduce back to iia and finally performing two t - dualities along the spatial field theory directions as described in @xcite .",
    "the reality of the new metric requires that @xmath268 which imposes @xmath269 , thus the unrotated dilaton must be bounded above for the rotated solution to make sense can hold for any position in space ] .",
    "it is then the asymptotically constant dilaton ( ) that is compatible with this rotation .",
    "a glance at shows that the form of the dilaton has changed .",
    "this is because the rotation introduces d2-branes which the dilaton couples to .",
    "this tells us that we must have d2-branes in the rotated system but we may have more and we can only tell by looking at the explicit terms of @xmath244 .    in order to succinctly express the explicit structure of the forms expressed in it is helpful to introduce the following vielbein basis for the rotated theory : @xmath270 the components of the ns 3-form expressed in this basis are : @xmath271 where : @xmath272 and @xmath148 is defined in .",
    "the components of the rr 4-form are the following : @xmath273 it is clear @xmath244 consists of 2 distinct parts .",
    "the first has support over the field theory coordinates which implies an electric coupling to d2-branes and the second with no time dependence which implies a magnetic coupling to d4-branes .",
    "thus we see that the rotation has generated d2 , d4 and ns5-branes .",
    "we can actually go further , from the definition of @xmath244 in we can see that we can easily extract @xmath274 .",
    "we just need to make the observation that @xmath275 where @xmath75 is the g - structure of appendix [ bps ] and @xmath254 is that of .",
    "thus if we take into account the maps in , we see that we must be able to express the 3-form gauge field @xmath276 as : @xmath277 it is a simple matter to verify ( with mathematica ) that our bps equations imply @xmath278 and so the fluxes obey the following equations of motion : @xmath279 thus the rotation has not created any additional sources and the the proof in @xcite ensures that all the equations of motion are satisfied .",
    "this background is the @xmath10 analogue of the baryonic branch , @xcite , of klebanov - strassler @xcite with additional flavour as in @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the that the field theory dual is likely to be a quiver gauge theory with additional fundamental flavour group . in @xcite , when @xmath116 , they note that @xmath276 is running on a 3 sphere at infinity which is analogous to the @xmath280 field in @xcite .",
    "the same happens here , indeed on the shrinking 3-cycle @xmath281 the integral of @xmath276 takes the following asymptotic form with respect to the solutions of : @xmath282 we will now set about calculating the charges of the branes in the background to try and gain some information about the field theory dual .",
    "when @xmath283 care needs to be taken here as we have a source for the ns 3 form @xmath245 , this implies that the usual improved field strengths may not be gauge invariant .      clearly , when the @xmath283 , there is a source for the ns 3-form which is difficult to interpret . we will not attempt to do so here but will calculate the brane charges to get some idea of what is going on in the background .",
    "the ns5 charge is obtained by integrating @xmath245 over the 3-sphere parametrised by @xmath20 .",
    "this will of course give a quantisation condition like that obtained for the unrotated d5-brane system in .",
    "however we have an additional factor now , expressed in terms of this gives : @xmath284 where it is now @xmath285 that is quantised .    to calculate the charge on the d2-brane it useful to first make the following observation .",
    "from the definitions of @xmath245 , @xmath276 and @xmath244 it is possible to show that the following relationship is implied by the bps system : @xmath286 where the term on the right hand side comes entirely from : @xmath287 the page and maxwell charges coincided for the ns5-brane , this is not so for the d2-brane ( see @xcite for a discussion on the various types of charge in a theory with sugra chern - simons terms ) .",
    "the maxwell charge is gauge invariant but not quantised in general , it is calculated by integrating @xmath288 over a 6-cycle , from a glance at it is clear that the only suitable cycle will be @xmath289 .",
    "we are thus lead to : @xmath290 in terms of the @xmath59 expansions of , where it should be reiterated that it is the asymptotically constant dilaton uv expansion that should be used , we can express this as : @xmath291 the number of d2-branes grows quickly in the uv , which is indicative of the rotation generating an irrelevant operator in the field theory dual as in @xcite@xcite , we will come back to this issue in the next section .",
    "one can define page for the d2 branes by integrating @xmath292 over the same cycle and as shown in we must clearly have that : @xmath293 the point here is that while @xmath294 is quantised it is not gauge invariant for large gauge transformations , where large means those that can not be expressed as @xmath295 and since @xmath245 has a source this might lead one to question whether the effect of @xmath296 on the integrand of @xmath294 is to add a total derivative .",
    "this is the case though because the only possible , non zero , infinitesimal gauge transformations on @xmath297 are of the form @xmath298 and @xmath299 on @xmath297 .",
    "] usually these large gauge transformation , which induce quantised shifts in page charge , are associated with seiberg dualities as in @xcite@xcite .",
    "however here it is @xmath274 rather than @xmath280 that is running , and supergravity is not invariant under unit shift in the integral of @xmath300 .",
    "this complicates issues if we wish to interpret the running of the @xmath301 as a duality cascade .",
    "the d4 maxwell charge is given by integrating @xmath302 over a compact 4 cycle .",
    "it is only the term @xmath303 in that does not contract with @xmath130 but this does depend on @xmath142 .",
    "this implies that the charge is not quantised , it runs . in terms of the @xmath59 expansions it takes the form : @xmath304 clearly the number of d4-branes vanishes in both the far ir and far uv but is running in between .",
    "there is an issue here , the fact that there is no @xmath305 gauge field in this system tells us that maxwell and page charges should coincide for the d4-brane .",
    "however we see from that even when @xmath116 this charge is running .      at present",
    "it is clear that the warp factor @xmath29 tend to a non - zero constant in the uv ( see ) , we would like to define a decoupling limit where the metric become asymptotically ads so we need @xmath306 in the uv .",
    "@xmath307 so we need to take the limit @xmath308 in a well defined way .",
    "we proceed as in @xcite by rescaling the field theory coordinates : @xmath309 we can now define a new metric : @xmath310\\ ] ] where @xmath311 is unchanged but the new warp factor , in the limit @xmath308 , is given by @xmath312 .",
    "although this seems like a reasonably sensible limit for the metric , this is not so for @xmath244 and the rotated dilaton in .",
    "a finite limit can be obtained if we simultaneously take : @xmath313 then the fluxes and dilaton are finite as in @xcite , however there is a problem with @xmath314 . from the asymptotically constant dilaton expansions ( , ) , we have that : @xmath315 the leading order term here represents a deformation away from the field theoretically acceptable ads asymptotics .",
    "this is due to the sharply rising number of d2-branes in the uv which must be inducing d2-brane charge on the ns5-branes in an analogous way to what happens in @xcite .",
    "there it was a growing number of d3-branes on the conifold , where it signalled a departure of the dual field theory from 4-dimensional cascade behaviour dual to an irrelevant operator .",
    "we expect the same picture to apply here , in particular , as in @xcite , a profile which decays for large @xmath119 will remove the irrelevant operator and give the field theory dual a uv completion .",
    "we can achieve this by introducing a profile of the form @xmath316 for large @xmath119 , this is equivalent to setting all @xmath6 terms which do not multiply a @xmath317 to zero in the series solutions , ] .for such a profile we have that in the uv : @xmath318 this asymptotic behaviour does indeed lead to a decoupling limit .",
    "expressed in terms of @xmath119 , when @xmath316 , the leading order terms of the other functions in the metric are given by : @xmath319 which implies that after a further rescaling of the field theory coordinate , the metric can be expressed as @xmath320\\ ] ] where we have introduced a new holographic coordinate @xmath321 .",
    "this explicitly shows that , when @xmath308 , the metric is asymptotically @xmath322 where y is the metric at the tip of the bryant - salamon @xmath10 cone @xcite .",
    "thus we have defined a decoupling limit , @xmath231 , where the the asymptotically minkowski region can be removed an replaced by a boundary .",
    "the theory is not however asymptotically conformal as the rotated dilaton has the expansion : @xmath323",
    "in this work we considered adding unquenched massive fundamental matter to the maldacena - nastase background @xcite . this was done by introducing a flavour profile that interpolates between the deformed maldacena - nastase solution and a massless flavoured solutions similar to the one found in @xcite .",
    "it was explicitly shown that , starting from a profile of a quite arbitrary form , there are asymptotic , semi - analytic , solutions to the bps system .",
    "these are consistent massive flavour deformations of both the linear dilaton and flavoured @xmath10-cone solutions found in @xcite .",
    "the massive bps system is free from the ir singularities that so plague backgrounds with massless flavours ( see @xcite for an exception ) and in particular it was possible to derive a semi analytic solution in the ir .",
    "a phenomenologically motivated profile was proposed to interpolate between the asymptotic solutions and it was shown via a numerical study that , indeed , the ir and uv expansions can be continuously connected .",
    "the pathology free background was then shown to be dual in the ir to @xmath4 sym - cs with level @xmath11 and @xmath6 massive flavours .",
    "there is a degree of ambiguity in defining the chern - simons level away from the deep ir .",
    "we decided to have level that is quantised everywhere so that the system is consistent after rotation .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether there is a field theory explanation for the levels @xmath6 independence , or whether one has to abandon quantisation of k over the whole range of the holographic coordinate .",
    "however we found that the qualitative field theory results did not depend to much on this choice .",
    "it would also be interesting to see if this theory has a mass gap .",
    "a recent field theory calculation @xcite has shown that a gap exists for pure @xmath4 sym - cs but the effect of additional fundamental matter is , at least to our knowledge , yet to be explored .",
    "for the holographic dual , the dilaton and warp factors of the metric are bounded in the ir which is suggestive of gap but it would be interesting to confirm this with a calculation of the glue ball spectrum , in the spirit of @xcite@xcite .    on the formal side , it is unfortunate that a derivation of a profile corresponding to a specific massive brane embedding is absent here .",
    "it was derived for the dual of sqcd with massive flavours in @xcite .",
    "they achieved this via a microscopic calculation for a simplified case and then , using a mathematical trick , they conjecture a profile for the general case .",
    "sadly neither technique seems to be applicable for this background , at least for now , and the reasons are two fold .",
    "firstly the microscopic calculation relies heavily on the fact that their internal space is the conifold , here it is a @xmath10-manifold and the mathematical machinery , applicable to the former , is absent .",
    "secondly a partial integration of the bps system allows a vast simplification of the conifold system , such a simplification for @xmath10-manifold is yet to be derived .",
    "we leave the resolution of these issues to future work and trust that profiles do exist for concrete brane embeddings .",

    "it seems reasonable to expect that , as with the system before rotation , the dual field theory after rotaion will have a chern - simons level @xmath11 , however the non trivial @xmath244 means we can not perform the same easy check via s - duality .",
    "there are various difficulties with interpreting the field theory dual of this solution .",

    "we offer no explanation for the running page charge other than that page charge quantisation may not be universal .",
    "the source for the ns5-branes is unusual and there are perhaps issues with defining an action that includes this , however at the level of the equations of motion there does not seem to be any a priori problem with such a source . the picture of invariance of the integral of @xmath280 under shifts by @xmath8 , which is associate with a chain of seiberg dualities in a duality cascade in @xcite does not follow clearly here . however since we do have running integral of @xmath274 and the d2-brane page charge is quantised it is reasonable to expect similar behaviour , indeed in some loose sense this background is the t - dual of certain type - iib conifold backgrounds that exhibit such behaviour .",
    "the fast increasing number of d2-branes in the uv is by now well understood in terms of the rotation creating an irrelevant operator in the uv of the field theory @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "it signals the departure of the dual field theory from @xmath14 dimensional dynamics and indicates the need for a uv completion .",
    "this issue was solved , as in @xcite , by using a profile that decays in the uv and we where in fact able to show that it is possible to take a decoupling limit in which the background becomes asymptotically @xmath324 , where @xmath325 is the tip of the bryant - salamon @xmath10 cone @xcite .",
    "it seems reasonable that the dual field theory will be a @xmath14 dimensional quiver with gauge group @xmath326 , where @xmath327 and @xmath328 , for @xmath329 the integral of @xmath274 .",
    "this fits nicely with the results @xcite , where sources are added to branes on the conifold .",
    "unfortunately such a convincing set of tests , as exists for @xcite , are not yet available for this background so we leave the confirmation of the speculative gauge group for future work .",

    "we require that the massive flavour background also satisfies these equations . using these projections",
    "it is possible to derive the bps equations as a consequence of the vanishing susy variations of the dilatino and gravitino .",
    "an alternative route to the bps equations is to use g - structures@xcite .",
    "the internal space is a manifold of @xmath10 holonomy and so it is equipped with an associative 3-form defined in terms of the fermionic biliners by : @xmath335 where @xmath336 is a 7 dimensional gamma matrix . for a background to be supersymetric",
    "the 3-form , @xmath75 , must satisfy the following set of equations : @xmath337 for the specific projections obeyed by this background the @xmath10-structure form can be shown to be given by : @xmath338 where : @xmath339 specifically this gives : .",
    "@xmath340 inserting this 3-form into and performing some algebra ( with mathematica ) gives the following set of first order differential bps equations : @xmath341 in addition to the following algebraic identity : @xmath342 where : @xmath343 from it is possible to derive the values of the various trigonometric functions contained in and if we take its derivative , after some tedious algebra , we arrive at the following consistency requirement : @xmath344 although the proof in @xcite , ensures this it is a simple matter to show that this bps system solve the type - iib supergravity equations of motion . as a constance check",
    "this was done but as it is not particularly illuminating and it shall be omitted in the interest of brevity .",
    "in @xcite massless flavours were added to the maldacena - nastase background , the purpose of this appendix is give a brief review and to allow comparison of the expansions of massive and massless backgrounds .",
    "the starting point is the following einstein frame metric that was proposed to account for the flavour deformation : @xmath345 where as consequence of the vanishing of the susy variations of the dilatino and gravitino we have that @xmath158 .",
    "@xmath23 is chosen as in .",

    "this gives the following components for @xmath43 in the vielbein basis ( ): @xmath350 where : @xmath351 the pull - back of @xmath35 onto the cycle on which the color branes are wrapped , @xmath44 defined by , which must vanish in the ir for a non singular background , then determines the value of the integration constant to be : @xmath352 with this choice of @xmath33 all dependence of the set up on @xmath96 then drops out . observe also that the choice @xmath100 is equivalent to having @xmath99 which is useful to make contact with the massive flavour case where @xmath33 is forced to take this value .",
    "irrespective of the choice of @xmath33 , upon taking the exterior derivative of we arrive at the following smearing form : @xmath353 this smearing form fills the codimensions of a tipple branched supersymmetric brane embedding .    in",
    "@xcite the bps equations were solved in terms of : @xmath354 where , for @xmath355 , @xmath168 corresponds to the ir boundary .",
    "a curvature singularity means that a semi analytic , small @xmath119 , solution can not be derive .",
    "however on constancy grounds it was argued that the ir values of the various functions in the set up took the following forms : @xmath356 there is no such problem in the uv where there are in fact 2 expansions , one with an asymptotically linear dilaton and one where the dilaton asymptotes to a constant . in @xcite",
    "they decided to proceed numerically from @xmath166 and showed that the , near to , ir conditions could be smoothly connected to the uv expansions , with @xmath33 defined as in . at this stage",
    "it should be pointed out that since the background turns out to be singular anyway it is questionable whether this choice of @xmath33 is actually required .",
    "indeed is defined in the ir where the effect of the curvature singularity is so severe that a small @xmath119 expansion does not appear to exist . since @xmath33 defines the precise form of the uv expansions the choice implies that the unphysical ir singularity is actually dictating what the uv expansion is and this seems perverse . at the very least we should except that other choices of @xmath33 might well be valid , in the uv at least .",
    "all of these other choices leave the @xmath96 dependence in the set up and it is for this reason that the uv expansions below have been written for arbitrary @xmath33 .",
