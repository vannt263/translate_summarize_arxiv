    "the mass difference between the constituents of the mixture can lead to new few- and many - body phenomena @xcite , such as novel trimer states @xcite or crystalline quantum phases @xcite .",
    "quantum gas mixtures of two elements have also attracted a great deal of attention because they are an ideal starting point for the coherent production of heteronuclear ground - state molecules , which can have large electric dipole moments @xcite .",
    "the dipole interaction can dominate the behavior of a quantum gas of these molecules and lead to intriguing many - body phenomena @xcite .",

    "advances in producing quantum degenerate samples of yb @xcite and alkaline - earth elements @xcite have led to efforts towards mixtures containing these elements and recently quantum degenerate yb - li mixtures were obtained @xcite .",

    "the ease of producing large quantum degenerate samples enabled by sympathetic narrow - line laser cooling , together with the large electric dipole moment of rbsr ground - state molecules of 1.5debye @xcite , make sr - rb quantum gas mixtures an ideal stepping stone towards the exploration of dipolar physics with open - shell molecules .",

    "the @xmath2sr cloud is slightly colder than the rb sample , which again leads to sympathetic laser cooling of rb .",
    "when choosing the final red mot parameters , we have to compromise between attainable temperature and remaining rb and sr atom numbers @xcite .",
    "we chose a temperature of @xmath70k , for which we obtain @xmath71 sr atoms and @xmath72 rb atoms , both elements at a psd of 0.4(1 ) .",
    "at this point the cooling laser beams are switched off .    starting with these excellent conditions ,",
    "we perform evaporative cooling by lowering the science trap depth exponentially over 8.8s to @xmath73nk for sr .",
    "strontium is evaporated , sympathetically cooling rb , and a double bec is formed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5_87rb84srbec ] ) . at the end of evaporation",
    "we obtain a pure @xmath2sr bec of @xmath74 atoms and @xmath75 quantum degenerate rb atoms accompanied by @xmath76 thermal rb atoms at a temperature of @xmath77nk .",
    "the rb cloud again contains a nearly equal mixture of the three @xmath31 @xmath55 states .",
    "the trapping frequencies in the x- , y- , and z - direction are at this point 40hz , 37hz , and 190hz for sr and 67 hz , 63hz , and 400hz for rb . for the lowest values of the science trap depth ,",
    "the gravitational sagging of the sr cloud is @xmath78 m larger than the gravitational sagging of the rb cloud . for comparison ,",
    "the thomas - fermi radii , calculated neglecting the interspecies mean - field , is 2.5@xmath9 m for the sr bec in the vertical direction and 2@xmath9 m for the rb bec .",
    "the two elements are barely overlapping , which reduces interspecies thermalization .",
    "the differential gravitational sag between sr and rb could be compensated for the magnetic rb @xmath31 , @xmath79 or @xmath80 state by using a magnetic field gradient in the vertical direction , which does not influence the non - magnetic sr .",
    "the peak density of the sr bec and of each @xmath55-state component of the rb bec is @xmath81@xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath22 lifetime of the becs is about 10s .",
    "the atom number of the sr bec can be increased at the expense of the rb bec atom number by reducing the mot loading time of rb . on absorption images of @xmath2sr-@xmath0rb",
    "double becs taken after 24ms of expansion , we observe that the position of the sr bec is shifting downwards for an increasing rb bec atom number .",
    "this observation hints at a positive mean - field interaction and therefore a positive interspecies scattering length between @xmath0rb and @xmath2sr .",
    "we have presented the production of @xmath1sr-@xmath0rb and @xmath2sr-@xmath0rb double becs .",
    "crucial to our success are the favorable interaction properties of the two mixtures . for both mixtures",
    "we observe efficient thermalization . at the same time",
    "the mixtures do not suffer from large inelastic three - body losses .",
    "these interaction properties can not be predicted by _",
    "ab - initio _ calculation and were completely unknown prior to our work .",
    "a central stage in our scheme is sympathetic narrow - line laser cooling of rb by sr .",
    "this powerful technique will also be useful to cool other species besides @xmath0rb , including fermions , and should work if one of the four sr isotopes has good interspecies scattering properties with the target species",
    ". it might even be possible to sympathetically laser cool the target species to quantum degeneracy without using evaporation @xcite .",
    "this goal will be facilitated by selectively increasing the density of the target species with a species - specific dipole potential @xcite or by using a target species of low mass , which leads to a high critical temperature or fermi temperature for a given density .",
    "our next goal is the creation of rbsr molecules .",
    "we plan to associate atoms to weakly - bound molecules by either magneto - association @xcite or stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite .",
    "these molecules will then be transferred into the ro - vibrational ground - state by stirap @xcite .",
    "we are currently performing photoassociation spectroscopy of the @xmath82sr-@xmath0rb mixtures , in order to precisely determine the interspecies scattering lengths of all sr - rb isotopic combinations , the magnetic field values of sr - rb magnetic feshbach resonances , and stirap paths for molecule association and ground - state transfer .",
    "the optimal sr - rb isotopic mixture for our task will depend on these properties , especially the interspecies scattering length , which determines the miscibility of the rb and sr quantum gases .",
