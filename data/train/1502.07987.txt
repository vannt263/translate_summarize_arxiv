    "leptogenesis  @xcite is an elegant unifying framework for dynamically generating both the measured matter - antimatter asymmetry in our universe and the observed smallness of the light neutrino masses  @xcite . in scenarios of resonant leptogenesis ( rl )",
    "@xcite , this mechanism may be testable in foreseeable laboratory experiments .",
    "rl relies on the fact that the @xmath4-type @xmath3-asymmetry becomes dominant  @xcite and gets resonantly enhanced , when at least two of the heavy neutrinos have a small mass difference comparable to their decay widths  @xcite .",
    "this resonant enhancement allows a successful low - scale leptogenesis  @xcite , whilst retaining perfect agreement with the light - neutrino oscillation data .",
    "the level of testability is further extended in the scenario of resonant @xmath5-genesis ( rl@xmath6 ) , where the final lepton asymmetry is dominantly generated and stored in a _",
    "lepton flavour @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "in such models , the heavy neutrinos could be as light as the electroweak scale  @xcite , whilst still having sizable couplings to other charged - lepton flavours @xmath7 .",
    "thus , rl@xmath6 scenarios may be directly testable at the energy frontier in the run - ii phase of the lhc  @xcite , as well as in various low - energy experiments searching for lepton flavour / number violation  @xcite at the intensity frontier .",
    "flavour effects in both heavy - neutrino and charged - lepton sectors , as well as the interplay between them , can play an important role in determining the final lepton asymmetry in low - scale leptogenesis models ( for a review , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these intrinsically - quantum effects can , in principle , be accounted for by extending the classical flavour - diagonal boltzmann equations for the number densities of individual flavour species to a semi - classical evolution equation for a _ matrix of number densities _ ,",
    "analogous to the formalism presented in  @xcite for light neutrinos .",
    "this so - called ` density matrix ' formalism has been adopted to describe flavour effects in various leptogenesis scenarios  @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown  @xcite , in a semi - classical approach , that a consistent treatment of _ all _ pertinent flavour effects , including flavour mixing , oscillations and off - diagonal ( de)coherences , necessitates a _ fully _ flavour - covariant formalism , in order to provide a complete and unified description of rl ; for a summary , see  @xcite . in this flavour - covariant formalism",
    ", the resonant mixing of different heavy - neutrino flavours and coherent oscillations between them are found to be two _ distinct _ physical phenomena , in analogy with the experimentally - distinguishable phenomena of mixing and oscillations in the neutral @xmath8- , @xmath9- , @xmath10- and @xmath11-meson systems  @xcite .",
    "one can go beyond the semi - classical ` density - matrix ' approach to leptogenesis by means of a quantum field - theoretic analogue of the boltzmann equations , known as the kadanoff - baym ( kb ) equations  @xcite ( for a review , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "such ` first - principles ' approaches to leptogenesis  @xcite are , in principle , capable of accounting consistently for all flavour effects , in addition to off - shell and finite - width effects , including thermal corrections .",
    "however , it is often necessary to use truncated gradient expansions and quasi - particle ansaetze to relate the propagators appearing in the kb equations to particle number densities .",
    "recently , using the novel perturbative formulation of thermal field theory developed in  @xcite , it was shown  @xcite that quantum transport equations for leptogenesis can be obtained from the kb formalism without the need for gradient expansion or quasi - particle ansaetze , thereby capturing fully the pertinent flavour effects .",
    "specifically , the source term for the lepton asymmetry obtained , at leading order , in this kb approach  @xcite was found to be exactly the same as that obtained in the semi - classical flavour - covariant approach of  @xcite , confirming that flavour mixing and oscillations are indeed two _ physically - distinct _ phenomena .",
    "the proper treatment of these flavour effects may have a significant effect upon the final lepton asymmetry , as compared to partially flavour - dependent or flavour - diagonal limits , thereby altering the viable parameter space for models of rl and impacting upon the prospects of testing the leptogenesis mechanism .",
    "the plan of these proceedings is as follows . in section  [ sec : covariant ]",
    ", we review the main features of our _ fully _ flavour - covariant formalism in the context of leptogenesis . in section  [ sec : semiclassical ] , we present the markovian flavour - covariant transport equations for lepton and heavy - neutrino number densities with arbitrary flavour content .",
    "we also discuss a numerical example to illustrate the full impact of the flavour off - diagonal effects within the context of an rl@xmath12 model . in section  [ sec :",
    "quantum ] , we derive the quantum transport equations relevant to the source term for the lepton asymmetry , following a well - defined perturbative loopwise truncation scheme , making comparison with the semi - classical approach discussed in section  [ sec : semiclassical ] .",

    "<S> flavour effects play an important role in the statistical evolution of particle number densities in several particle physics phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> we present a fully flavour - covariant formalism for transport phenomena , in order to consistently capture all flavour effects in the system . </S>",
    "<S> we explicitly study the scenario of resonant leptogenesis ( rl ) , and show that flavour covariance requires one to consider generically off - diagonal number densities , rank-4 rate tensors in flavour space , and non - trivial generalization of the discrete symmetries @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . the flavour - covariant transport equations , obtained in our semi - classical framework , describe the effects of _ three _ relevant physical phenomena : coherent heavy - neutrino oscillations , quantum decoherence in the charged - lepton sector , and resonant @xmath3 violation due to heavy - neutrino mixing . </S>",
    "<S> we show quantitatively that the final asymmetry predicted in rl models may vary by as much as an order of magnitude between partially flavour off - diagonal treatments . </S>",
    "<S> a full field - theoretic treatment in the weakly - resonant regime , based on the kadanoff - baym ( kb ) equations , confirms that heavy - neutrino oscillations and mixing are two _ distinct _ phenomena , and reproduces the results obtained in our semi - classical framework . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that the quasi - particle ansaetze , often employed in kb approaches to rl , discard the phenomenon of mixing , capturing only oscillations and leading to an underestimate of the final asymmetry by a factor of order 2 . </S>"
