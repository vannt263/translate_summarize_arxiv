    "recent studies on secular dynamics in near - keplerian potentials @xcite have focused attention on the long - term dynamical evolution of stars and compact objects in galactic nuclei . due to persistent gravitational torques exerted by stellar orbits on each other as they precess slowly around the supermassive black hole ( smbh )",
    ", the angular momentum evolution of stellar orbits can proceed at a much higher rate than that of energy evolution ( resonant relaxation ; * ? ? ? * ) . in this paper",
    "we extend this research to study secular dynamical effects on the inspiral of a massive body , e.g. , an intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ) , into the combined potential of an smbh and nuclear stellar cluster .    as a body of mass @xmath1 moves through a distribution of field stars of individual mass @xmath2",
    ", it experiences a frictional force anti - parallel to its velocity @xmath3 , @xmath4 \\frac{{\\bf v}}{v^3}. \\label{eq : chandra}\\ ] ] this is chandrasekhar s dynamical friction formula @xcite for an isotropic field star distribution normalized such that the density @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the coulomb logarithm .",
    "the formula accounts only for stars moving slower than the massive body , and it neglects self - gravity of the stars themselves ; @xcite have recently updated the formula to include changes induced by the massive body on the stellar velocity distribution and the contribution from stars moving faster .",
    "the stars are deflected by the massive body into a gravitational `` wake '' behind it which results in an increase in stellar density , the amplitude of which is proportional to @xmath1 @xcite ; hence , the gravitational force experienced by the massive body is proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "this frictional force acts to decrease the kinetic energy and angular momentum of the massive body and it sinks towards the center of the potential",
    ".    the picture described above does not take into account the orbit - averaged dynamics that is particular for near - keplerian potentials and that has been shown to play a central role in the angular momentum evolution of stars near the smbh .",
    "indeed , it is natural to assume that some other form of dynamical friction could be associated with the orbit - averaged potential created by the imbh , as this potential is rotating around the smbh due to precession of the imbh s eccentric orbit .",
    "the possibility of this secular dynamical friction was already suggested by @xcite in 1996 . in this paper",
    "we explore this effect and find that , contrary to our experience with ordinary dynamical friction , the resulting torque comes from a gravitational force acting in the same direction as that of the imbh precession .",
    "we therefore refer to this effect as `` secular dynamical anti - friction '' ( sdaf ) .    for the remainder of the paper we will keep referring to the massive in - spiraling body as an imbh , though the reader should keep in mind that the essential dynamics will hold for any massive body moving in a near - keplerian potential . as large mass ratio massive black hole binaries",
    "are expected to coalesce in at least some merging and non - merging galaxies @xcite , the dynamics of such systems are important to understand",
    ".    in particular , imbh inspirals into smbhs will be a major source of gravitational waves for space - based laser interferometers such as the proposed european new gravitational wave observatory @xcite .",
    "simulations of the inspiral of imbhs ( @xmath8 ) through nuclear stellar clusters embedding an smbh have shown an increase in eccentricity of the imbh @xcite . here , we show that the theory of sdaf can explain the initial stages of this phenomenon and present results of @xmath0-body simulations set up to test this claim .",
    "let us consider the combined gravitational potential of an smbh , mass @xmath9 , embedded in a nuclear star cluster with a power - law number density distribution , @xmath10 , and individual stellar masses @xmath11 . the specific energy and angular momentum of a stellar orbit can be written in terms of kepler elements as @xmath12 @xmath13^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the semi - major axis of the elliptical orbit , and @xmath15 is the eccentricity .",
    "the eccentricity vector , @xmath16 , of the star is that which points from the occupied focus of the orbit to the periapsis of the orbit and has a magnitude equal to the scalar eccentricity of the orbit , @xmath17 the orbit of a star in this potential is nearly keplerian ( i.e. , closed ) but @xmath16 will precess due to the additional ( newtonian ) potential and general relativity .",
    "we define the precession time , @xmath18 , as a timescale over which an orbit precesses by @xmath19 in its plane . as newtonian precession acts with retrograde motion ( i.e. , in the direction opposite of a star s motion ) and general relativistic precession with prograde motion , @xmath20 the general relativistic precession time",
    "is given by @xmath21 with the orbital period @xmath22 .",

    "for all values of @xmath29 , the newtonian precession time of a stellar orbit increases with eccentricity .",
    "the difference in precession times for circular and highly eccentric stellar orbits varies with @xmath29 .",
    "we plot @xmath18 in figure [ f : prec_e ] , setting the quantity in brackets @xmath30 $ ] in equation ( [ eq : tm ] ) equal to 1 , with @xmath31 as given in @xcite . for a steep cusp , @xmath32 @xcite",
    ", there is a factor of @xmath33 difference in precession time for a near - circular ( @xmath34 ) and near - radial ( @xmath35 ) orbit , which increases to @xmath36 for a shallow profile @xmath37 .",
    "we plot equation ( 13 ) from @xcite and equation ( a11 ) from @xcite ( @xmath38 ) as a comparison .",
    "differences arise in the normalization of the functions due to approximations made in deriving the analytical formulae in these papers ; the monotonic dependence of the precession time on orbital eccentricity persists .",
    "we note that the exact expressions for the precession time in @xcite agrees with numerical evaluation of our equation ( [ eq : tm ] ) .    ) of a stellar orbit on orbital eccentricity , @xmath15 .",
    "several values are plotted for different power - law density profiles , @xmath10 . the dependence given in (",
    "* m11 ) and ( * ? ? ?",

    "[ f : prec_e],height=85 ]    we now introduce an imbh of mass @xmath39 on an orbit with non - zero eccentricity , @xmath40 , and semi - major axis , @xmath41 , within the dynamical radius , @xmath42 , of the smbh , defined such that the mass in stars at @xmath42 equals that of the smbh , @xmath43 . as we are interested in secular dynamics , it is useful to envisage the mass of the imbh spread smoothly out along its orbit , such that the local density at any segment is inversely proportional to its local velocity .",
    "the position of furthest distance from the smbh , the apoapsis of the orbit , will therefore contain the most mass . over a timescale",
    "longer than its orbital period but much less than the precession time , it will exert a strong ( specific ) gravitational torque on the orbit of a star with a similar semi - major axis @xcite on the order of @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the angle between two orbits .",
    "the orbit of the imbh will not affect the energy ( or equivalently , the semi - major axis ) of the stellar orbit as its gravitational potential is stationary over this timescale .",
    "a star on a coplanar orbit with the imbh will experience a torque that is parallel ( or anti - parallel ) to its angular momentum vector @xmath46 .",
    "hence , the torque will act to change the magnitude of @xmath46 ; equivalently , the eccentricity of the orbit .",
    "let us consider the stellar orbit with an eccentricity @xmath47 and semi - major axis @xmath48 .",
    "we place the orbit such that its eccentricity vector forms an angle @xmath49 with that of the imbh .    if there existed no gravitational interaction ( secular or otherwise ) between the imbh and the star , they would precess in the background stellar potential at the same rate .",
    "their eccentricity vectors would rotate by @xmath50 in one @xmath18 and @xmath45 would remain constant .",
    "switching on secular gravitational interactions results in a strong secular encounter between the star and the imbh .",
    "the star s orbit is pushed away from the imbh , transferring negative or positive angular momentum to the orbit of the imbh , depending on its orientation .",
    "we elaborate on the dynamics in the following .",
    "if the star is moving on a prograde orbit ( in the direction of motion of the imbh ) that leads in front of the imbh ( in terms of precession direction ; see figure [ f : scheme ] : left ) , it will experience a torque in the direction of its angular momentum vector @xmath46 such that @xmath51 . due to the resulting decrease in eccentricity",
    ", the stellar orbit will precess faster ( see figure [ f : prec_e ] ) and move away from the imbh . conversely if the stellar orbit is trailing , the torque exerted on it will be anti - parallel to @xmath46",
    ". the stellar orbit will increase in eccentricity , precess more slowly and in effect be pushed away from the orbit of the imbh .",
    "in both cases , @xmath52 .",
    "a star moving along a retrograde orbit ( see figure [ f : scheme ] : right ) precesses in the opposite direction to that of the imbh .",
    "if the orbit is leading in front of the imbh , the torque will act to increase its eccentricity and hence decrease the differential precession rate between the two orbits .",
    "this increases the timescale over which the stellar orbit experiences a coherent torque and its eccentricity can increase to one . in this scenario the orbit can easily `` flip '' through @xmath53 to a prograde orbit , and be pushed away from the imbh as described above .",
    "if if does not flip , the retrograde orbit will precess past the imbh orbit , experience a torque which will decrease its eccentricity and hence will increase the differential precession rate between the two orbits . once again , in both cases the stellar orbit is pushed away from that of the imbh , @xmath52 .",
    "in contrast to chandrasekhar s dynamical friction , which acts to increase the density of stars behind a massive body , the effect of sdaf is to push stellar orbits away from that of the massive body .",
    "the varying strength of chandrasekhar s dynamical friction on different segments of a massive body s orbit causes evolution of orbital eccentricity , the sign of which is dependent on the background stellar density profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "with sdaf , it is the relative number of prograde / retrograde stellar orbits which determines the sign of the orbital eccentricity evolution of the imbh .      during a strong secular encounter of the imbh with a star",
    ", the angular momentum of the star is randomized .",
    "the rate of encounters of the imbh with retrograde stars is higher than that of prograde stars , and the net result is to decrease the angular momentum of the imbh .",
    "if the precession direction of the imbh is artificially reversed , the net torque changes sign and the angular momentum of the imbh increases .",
    "migration is important in this picture .",
    "if the imbh does not migrate , then the relative number of prograde and retrograde orbits quickly adjusts so there is no net secular torque in the steady state .",
    "however , if the imbh migrates due to dynamical friction , the adjustment does not have time to occur and there is an anti - friction torque . in the next section ,",
    "we perform numerical simulations to test this picture .",
    "the @xmath0-body simulations of @xcite show an increase in the eccentricity of an imbh as it spirals into an smbh .",
    "with careful analysis of the orbital properties of the field stars , the authors attribute the increase to secular chaos ( and the kozai mechanism ) , brought about by the non - axisymmetric potential induced by the imbh .",
    "this acts to bring the relative number of orbits back into balance after prograde - moving stars are preferentially ejected by the imbh ( retrograde stars have larger relative velocities with respect to the imbh than prograde , and hence are ejected less frequently ) .",
    "the retrograde orbits moving to prograde orbits extract angular momentum from the orbit of the imbh and its eccentricity increases .",
    "@xcite present both hybrid and direct @xmath0-body simulations with stellar cusps of varying degrees of rotation , to examine the importance of the relative number of prograde / retrograde orbits on the orbital evolution of the imbh .",
    "the authors propose a hypothesis in which the ejections of stars , via the slingshot mechanism , are the cause of the evolution of the imbh eccentricity .",
    "most retrograde orbits which end up being ejected from the potential , donate their negative angular momentum to the imbh and move to prograde orbits before they escape .",
    "again it is the preferential ejection of prograde orbits that drives the increase of the orbital eccentricity of the imbh .    with sdaf ,",
    "it is the cumulative secular torques from retrograde stellar orbits that lead to the increase in orbital eccentricity of an imbh , irrespective of ejections of stars from the potential .",
    "sdaf makes testable predictions which can distinguish itself from the above theories .    1 .",
    "if the orbit of the imbh is made to artificially precess in the opposite direction to its true motion , its rate of change of angular momentum should reverse sign as well .",
    "if escaping stars are injected back into the cluster with the same parameters as before their interaction with the imbh , the eccentricity evolution of the imbh should not qualitatively be affected .",
    "3 .   due to",
    "the `` pushing away '' of coplanar stellar orbits , there will be a density anisotropy in the stellar distribution as a result of sdaf .",
    "4 .   if dynamical friction is artificially slowed , there will be a lower rate of axisymmetric flow of retrograde orbits to one side of the imbh s orbit and hence a lower negative rate of change of angular momentum .    in the following section we present the results of numerical trials to test the theory of sdaf and decrease of orbital angular momentum of an imbh in a galactic nucleus .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper are performed using a special - purpose , mixed - variable symplectic @xmath0-body integrator as described in @xcite .",
    "we use a galactic nucleus model with parameters chosen to represent the galactic center . at the center of the coordinate system",
    ", there is an smbh with @xmath54 @xcite , and an imbh with a mass @xmath39 within the range @xmath55 { m_{\\odot}}$ ] with @xmath56 .",

    ", we include an isotropically distributed population of test stars with individual masses @xmath11 within the range @xmath59 { m_{\\odot}}$ ] which gravitationally interact only with the imbh , not with each other . in doing",
    "so we isolate the effects of the imbh on the stellar orbits .",
    "the orbits of the imbh and the test stars precess according to equation ( [ eq : tprec ] ) , such that for each time step , @xmath60 , they rotate in their orbital plane by an angle @xmath61 .",
    "as the imbh moves in a smooth stellar potential , it experiences no dynamical friction from it .",
    "to account for this we use the dynamical friction formulae given by @xcite to artificially decrease the semi - major axis of the imbh s orbit .",
    "@xcite use a self - consistent velocity distribution function in place of the standard maxwellian assumption and an improved formula for the coulomb logarithm to arrive at dynamical friction timescale for a near - keplerian potential , which can differ by a factor of three from the standard formula in equation ( [ eq : chandra ] ) .",

    "in contrast , the eccentricity vectors of retrograde orbits ( those which do not flip to prograde orbits ) will , in a time - averaged sense , cluster around that of the imbh before they are pushed away , as they precess more slowly due to the increase in their orbital eccentricity .",
    "we find that the presence of a massive body , such as an imbh , surrounded by less massive objects in a near - keplerian potential tends to segregate the lighter objects into a region dominated by prograde orbits and one dominated by retrograde .",
    "this mechanism has the strongest effect for , but is not restricted to , co - planar orbits , as scalar angular momentum changes result in eccentricity changes whereas vector angular momentum relaxation re - orients the stellar orbital plane .    in figure",

    ". the top figure shows a schematic of eight octants in eccentricity vector space .",
    "we rotate the cluster such that the eccentricity vector of the imbh lies parallel with ( 1,1,1 ) and follow the change in the number of massless stellar orbits with eccentricity vectors in each octant .",
    "the middle plot shows the results for prograde orbits and the bottom plot for retrograde . there is a clear increase in the number of prograde stellar orbits in octant 8 , opposite that in which the imbh lies , as expected .",
    "furthermore , there is an enhancement of retrograde stellar orbits in octant 1 as the theory predicts .",
    "here we examine two of the main testable predictions of sdaf : the eccentricity evolution of an imbh with ( 1 ) artificially reversed apsidal precession and ( 2 ) with a decreased migration rate from chandrasekhar s dynamical friction .",
    "we present the results of short - term simulations performed to test these predictions , using ten realizations for each simulation . in the following , @xmath54 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .",
    "we integrate the orbits of @xmath94 test stars in each simulation , distributed from @xmath95 , with @xmath96 .    in figure [",

    "the reference simulation with the correct precession rate @xmath99 shows an increase in eccentricity as expected .",
    "increasing the precession rate by a factor of @xmath100 does not however increase the rate of eccentricity growth , as the imbh orbit has less time to exert torques on the surrounding stellar orbits . in the next two simulations we reverse the direction of apsidal precession of the imbh , keeping the precession period roughly constant in relation to the first two simulations .",
    "the overall eccentricity growth of the imbh is negative , as predicted .",
    "next , we present the results of simulations wherein we change the migration rate of the imbh ( figure [ f : mig ] ) .",

    "we find it makes no significant difference for the angular momentum evolution of the imbh even though it significantly reduces the number of stellar ejections ( by a factor of @xmath109 ) .",
    "the problem of dynamical friction on a bar rotating through a spherical stellar system has been studied by @xcite .",
    "the authors find that the torque is directed opposite to the direction of the bar s rotation ; see , e.g. , their equation ( 67 ) .",
    "this seems in contradiction with our finding that the precessing imbh orbit experiences a torque directed in the same direction as its precession .",
    "we note however , that equation ( 67 ) of @xcite is derived under the assumption that the bar s mass is small enough such that its effect on the orbits of the stars is weak and perturbation theory can be used .",
    "we , on the other hand , explore the regime where the relevant secular interactions between the imbh and the stars are strong .",
    "a secular horse - shoe orbit is an example of such an interaction , an angular momentum flip is another one .      for a non - rotating stellar cusp ,",
    "the eccentricity increase in the imbh orbit due to sdaf is relatively small ( as seen in figures [ f : prec ] and [ f : mig ] ) .",

    ", there is a higher rate of strong secular encounters between either retrograde or prograde stellar orbits and that of the imbh and , as a result , the rate of eccentricity evolution of the imbh orbit due to sdaf is greatly enhanced .",
    "specifically , sdaf predicts a strong increase in orbital eccentricity of the imbh in counter - rotating clusters due to the increased number of retrograde stellar orbits , while it predicts a decrease for co - rotating clusters due to the increase in prograde orbits .    ,",

    "however , in contrast to @xcite s interpretation , we attribute this growth ( decrease ) to sdaf .",
    "we have presented a new secular gravitational - dynamical process in galactic nuclei which acts to decrease the orbital angular momentum of a massive body .",
    "there are two essential components to the decrease .",
    "the first is the net flow of retrograde orbits past that of the massive body which extracts orbital angular momentum .",
    "the second is chandrasekhar s dynamical friction force acting on the massive body which decreases its semi - major axis and provides a mechanism for net negative angular momentum change .",
    "although we have told this story in the context of an imbh inspiral into the center of a galaxy , the interactions described here will be valid for any massive body in a near - keplerian potential .",
    "sdaf can account for the rise in eccentricity only in the initial stages of the inspiral of the imbh , not during the stalling phase .",
    "the eccentricity does rise strongly in the stalling phase , as was identified in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of this increase is not sdaf ( which does not occur for non - migrating orbits ) , but is instead due to the conventional dynamical friction being reduced at the periastron ( inside the cavity ) as compared to that at the apoastron ( outside the cavity or closer to its edge ) .",
    "this effect was clearly explained in @xcite and for imbhs it plays decisive role .",
    "sdaf does however play an important role if the cusp is co- or counter - rotating relative to the imbh s orbit .",
    "observational predictions of sdaf include higher mass objects with increasingly larger eccentricities ( in non - rotating and counter - rotating stellar cusps ) , and density anisotropy in the stellar distribution near the plane of the massive body ."
