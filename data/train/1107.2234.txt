    "most of the ordinary ( visible ) matter in the universe , from a tiny terrestrial pebble to a giant star , is composed of protons and neutrons ( nucleons ) .",
    "these nucleons can assemble in a suite of different nuclear configurations .",
    "the masses of such bound nuclei are actually smaller than the sum of the masses of the free individual nucleons .",
    "the difference is a measure of the nuclear binding energy that holds the nucleus together , according to einstein s famous equation @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the speed of light and @xmath3 denotes the mass difference between the bound nuclei and the free nucleons .",
    "for example , the nuclide @xmath4fe is among the most tightly bound species , with a binding energy near 8.8 mev per nucleon .",
    "there are 82 elements that have stable isotopes , all the way from h to pb ( except for tc and pm ) .",
    "several dozen elements have only unstable isotopes , naturally abundant or artificially produced in nuclear physics laboratories ( the super - heaviest nucleus discovered to date has 118 protons and a half - life of 0.89 ms @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution of the nuclide abundances in the solar system , plotted as a function of the number of nucleons ( mass number ) , @xmath5 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ ssabun ] .",
    "it displays a complicated pattern , with h and he being by far the most abundant species",
    ". the abundances generally decrease for increasing mass number .",
    "exceptions to this behavior include the light elements li , be and b , which are extremely underabundant with respect to their neighbors , a pronounced peak near @xmath4fe ( the so - called _ iron - peak _ ) , and several noticeable maxima in the region of @xmath6 , for the distributions of both odd- and even - a species .    .",
    "abundances are based on meteoritic samples as well as on values inferred from the solar photosphere ( sect .",
    "values taken from lodders @xcite .",
    "[ ssabun ] ]    the reasons for favoring the presence of some species and for the specific pattern inferred for the solar system abundances have spawned large debates .",
    "following earlier attempts , hoyle proposed in 1946 that all heavy elements are synthesized in stars @xcite .",
    "a major breakthrough was achieved with the detection of technetium , an element with no stable isotopes , in the spectra of several s stars by merrill @xcite in the early 1950s . since the technetium isotopes have rather short half - lives on a galactic time scale , the obvious conclusion was that technetium must have been produced in the observed stars and thus nucleosynthesis must still be going on in the universe .",
    "shortly after , two seminal papers that provided the theoretical framework for the origin of the _ chemical _ species elements , were published ( almost exactly a century after darwin s treatise on the origin of _ biological _ species ) by burbidge , burbidge , fowler & hoyle @xcite , and independently , by cameron @xcite . these works identified stars as galactic factories that synthesize atomic nuclei via nuclear reactions .",
    "the stars return this processed material to the interstellar medium through various hydrostatic or explosive means during their evolution and thereby enrich the interstellar medium in _ metals _ , that is , any species heavier than he according to the astronomical jargon . out of this matter",
    "new generations of stars are born and a new cycle of nuclear transmutations will be initiated .",
    "in fact , without concourse of the many nuclear processes that take place in the stars and that are discussed in this review , the universe would have remained a chemically poor place , and probably no life form would have ever emerged .",
    "this review summarizes more than 50 years of progress in our understanding of the nuclear processes that shaped the current chemical abundance pattern of the universe .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly address the main aspects associated with the determination of the solar system abundances .",

    "particular attention is paid to the standard solar model and to lessons learned from neutrino physics . in sect . 5 , we outline the basic properties of red giant and agb stars , with emphasis on the _ s - process_. the series of explosive processes that characterize core - collapse supernovae and @xmath0-ray bursts ( e.g. , _ p- ,",

    "9 ) , and stellar mergers ( sect .",
    "we briefly address as well non - stellar processes , such as spallation reactions ( sect .",
    "11 ) , and conclude with a number of key puzzles and future perspectives in this field ( sect .",
    "the determination of the chemical composition of a distant star is not a trivial task .",
    "it basically relies on the analysis of the electromagnetic radiation emitted at different wavelengths ( so - called _ spectra _ ) . for the case of the solar system abundances , several sources of information ,",
    "that combine radiation and matter samples , are used to this end : the sun ( mainly photospheric absorption lines ) , meteorites , planets and moons ( mainly earth and moon ) . recently , several space probes have for the first time carried material from the interplanetary medium to earth .",
    "nasa s genesis mission collected about 0.4 mg of solar wind particles for two years , using 250 hexagonal ( 10 cm wide ) wafers made of silicon , sapphire , diamond , and gold . during descent in 2007",
    "the parachutes never opened and the capsule crashed , but fortunately the samples could be retrieved and analyzed .",
    "nasa s stardust mission , in turn , flew through the tail of comet wild-2 in 2004 and captured dust particles at a speed of 6.1 km s@xmath9 both in aerogel and in al foils .",
    "those samples were brought to earth in 2006 .",
    "inferring the elemental composition of the solar system from this variety of sources becomes a complex enterprise .",
    "first , earth does not show a homogeneous chemical composition .",
    "second , meteorites do not constitute a chemically unique class of objects , but different types exhibit large abundance differences .",
    "the usual approach to infer the bulk of solar system abundances relies on a very rare and primitive type of meteorites : ci carbonaceous chondrites , representing the least modified and chemically unaltered class of meteorites .",
    "named after the ivuna meteorite , the ci carbonaceous chondrite class includes only four other members : orgueil , alais , tonk and revelstoke . because of the extreme similarities of the abundances in ci chondrites ( determined through mass spectroscopy , wet chemistry , x - ray fluorescence , and neutron activation ) and those inferred from the solar photosphere ( for non - volatile elements ) , it is believed that this class of meteorites represents pristine material from which the solar system formed about 4.6 gyr ago .",
    "unfortunately , noble gases and other very volatile elements do not easily condense into solids .",
    "hence , values inferred from solar photospheric spectra are used instead to account for the c , n or o abundances , while other specific techniques are adopted for some special elements , such as ar , kr , xe , or hg . moreover , the meteoritic abundances have to be expressed relative to an element other than h. silicon is the species traditionally chosen , with a defined number abundance of n(si)=@xmath10 .",
    "this requires renormalization of the meteoritic values , such that the photospheric and meteoritic si abundances agree .",
    "the procedure guarantees that both abundance determinations rely on the same absolute scale .",
    "it is worth noting that photospheric abundances face two major drawbacks ( besides the fact that li is depleted in the solar atmosphere ) . on the one hand ,",
    "the precision achieved in photospheric abundance determinations is much lower than what can be obtained using mass spectroscopy measurements of meteoritic samples in laboratories . on the other hand , photospheric",
    "abundances are not directly measured but inferred from observations .",
    "this requires state - of - the - art models of the solar atmosphere as well as an accurate account of spectrum - formation processes . as an example , the recent improvements in atomic and molecular transition probabilities , coupled with the use of three - dimensional ( 3-d ) hydrodynamic solar atmosphere models that relax the assumption of a local thermodynamic equilibrium in spectral line formation , translated into a severe reduction of the abundances of c , n and o compared to previous estimates @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the existing 3-d models proved successful in reproducing a suite of characteristic solar features that 1-d models can not account for , including the observed solar granulation topology , typical length- and time - scales , convective velocities , and specific profiles of metallic lines . one of the major sources of uncertainty still remaining is the lack of accurate cross sections for excitation and ionization .",
    "unfortunately , photospheric abundance determinations of a few elements are not possible through spectroscopy of the quiet sun , and other techniques must be implemented .",
    "for instance , this is the case for the f and cl abundances , inferred from infrared spectroscopy of sunspots ( through molecular lines of hf and hcl , respectively ) . with regard to noble gases ,",
    "no photospheric lines are available because of their high excitation potentials .",
    "indirect determinations , using helioseismology ( he ) , x - ray and ultraviolet spectroscopy of the solar corona and solar flares ( ne ) , or solar wind measurements ( ne , ar ) , among others , are used to this end .    it is remarkable that while variations in the _ elemental _ composition have been found within the different existing sources , that can be attributed to a variety of physical , chemical and geological processes , the bulk _ isotopic _ composition of the solar system is extremely homogeneous .",
    "this circumstance turns out to be extremely useful since isotopic ratios of the sun can not be derived easily .",
    "in fact , direct isotopic measurements in the sun can only be performed through the analysis of co vibration - rotation lines in the infrared spectrum .",
    "therefore , except for h and the noble gases , isotopic abundances of the solar system are directly obtained from terrestrial samples . other sources are used for estimating isotopic ratios of the most volatile elements ( e.g. , @xmath11he/@xmath12he ) , such as the solar wind or lunar samples .",
    "in other cases , such as deuterium or @xmath13n/@xmath14n , estimates rely on measurements of the jovian atmosphere .",
    "it is worth noting that independent estimates of the chemical composition of the sun can also be obtained by comparison with solar - like stars , ob stars ( hot , short - lived , massive main sequence stars ) , h ii regions ( large clouds of gas and plasma , characterized by the presence of ionized h , with recent star forming episodes , such as the orion nebula ) , or with the interstellar medium in the solar neighborhood .",
    "once the effects of diffusion in the sun and the chemical enrichment of the galaxy during the past 4.6 gyr are taken into account , very good agreement is achieved .",
    "many compilations of the solar system abundances have been published and the interested reader is referred to refs .",

    "o/@xmath15o ratios , on a linear scale , measured in almost all solar system samples ( dashed lines indicate terrestrial ratios ) .",
    "presolar grains make up at most a few hundred parts per million ( ppm ) of the mass in the most primitive meteorites .",
    "notice that their oxygen isotopic ratios deviate by orders of magnitude from what is found in bulk solar system matter .",

    "[ larry ] ]    starting in the 1960s , studies have revealed that a minor fraction of the material embedded in meteorites ( some micron - sized and smaller dust particles ) showed huge isotopic anomalies when compared with standard solar system material ( see fig .",

    "this has been interpreted as heterogeneities present already in the solar nebula before the first solids began to condense and hence have been coined _",
    "presolar grains_. unfortunately , the tiny amount of radioactive material present in those grains does not allow us at present to directly confirm this conjecture through radioactive dating .",
    "these grains are presumably produced by ancient stars of previous generations .",
    "so far , silicon carbide ( sic ) , graphite ( c ) , diamond ( c ) , silicon nitride ( si@xmath16n@xmath17 ) , silicates , and oxides ( such as corundum and spinel ) have been identified as presolar grains .",
    "ion microprobe analyses of single presolar grains reveal a variety of isotopic signatures that allow , via comparison with predictions from stellar models , an identification of their parent stars .",
    "low - mass red giants and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ( sec .",
    "5 ) have been identified as stellar sources of the majority of sic and oxide grains .",
    "supernovae ( most likely of the core - collapse variety ; see sect .",
    "6 ) are likely the sources of a small fraction of the sic and si grains , of low - density graphite grains , and of a few corundum grains .",
    "moreover , nanodiamonds carry a supernova signature in their xe and te isotopic abundances .",
    "finally , classical novae have been claimed as the likely stellar parents of a small number of sic , graphite and oxide grains .",

    "initial ideas for the big bang model were proposed by gamow , alpher , bethe , herman and collaborators in the 1940s in order to explain the origin of the chemical elements .",
    "they proposed that the universe was initially very dense and hot , and that it expanded and cooled to its present state .",
    "the elements would then be synthesized during an early time when the temperature and density conditions were appropriate for nuclear reactions to occur @xcite .",
    "such a model would also predict a relic background radiation of photons with a present temperature of a few kelvin @xcite .",
    "while the bulk of the elements are produced in stars rather than the early universe , the idea proved correct for the origin of the light species @xmath18h , @xmath19he , @xmath20he and @xmath21li .",
    "in addition , the observation of the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite , corresponding to a blackbody spectrum with a temperature of 2.73 k , was of paramount importance in this regard .",
    "it singled out the big bang theory as the prime candidate for the model of our universe .",
    "modern theories of cosmology are based on the assumption of a homogeneous and isotropic universe , as implied by the cosmological principle . the geometry and evolution of the universe",
    "can then be predicted by the theory of general relativity , with a number of cosmological parameters describing the spatial curvature and overall expansion .",
    "the hubble parameter , @xmath22 , provides a measure for the expansion rate of the universe and its present - day value is called hubble s constant , @xmath23 .",
    "the mass density of baryons ( more precisely , of nucleons ) , @xmath24 , can be expressed relative to the critical density , @xmath25 , by introducing the cosmological baryon density parameter , @xmath26 .",
    "the critical density describes the borderline between a closed and an open universe , that is , the total density at which the universe is spatially flat , and is defined by the friedmann equation as @xmath27 , with @xmath28 the gravitational constant .",
    "the number density of photons is expected to have been constant since the epoch of electron - positron annihilation , which occurred during a time of @xmath294200  s after expansion began .",
    "the photon number density after that epoch can be found from the precise value for the present - day temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation , @xmath30  k @xcite , and is given by @xmath31  @xmath32 . using the definitions @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35  km  s@xmath9  mpc@xmath9 ,",
    "one finds for the relationship of the parameters introduced above the expression @xmath36 .",
    "the microwave background radiation carries a record of the conditions in the early universe at a time of last scattering , when hydrogen and helium nuclei recombined with electrons to form neutral atoms . as a result ,",
    "photons decoupled from baryons and the universe became transparent to radiation .",
    "any oscillations in the photon - baryon fluid around that time ( @xmath29400,000 years after the beginning of expansion ) would give rise to tiny variations of temperature ( on the @xmath37 level ) in different parts of the present microwave sky .",
    "the precise mapping of these anisotropies by nasa s wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) represented a spectacular success for cosmology .",
    "the observed anisotropies are usually decomposed in terms of spherical harmonics , where each term describes the magnitude of the anisotropy on a particular angular scale .",
    "the observed features in the resulting angular power spectrum are closely related to specific cosmological parameters .",
    "the analysis of the 5-year wmap data @xcite , when combined with other constraints @xcite , yields values of @xmath38 for the dimensionless hubble parameter and @xmath39 for the physical baryon density . from these results",
    "one can derive a number of other parameters : @xmath40   gyr for the age of the universe , @xmath41 g @xmath32 for the critical density , @xmath42 for the baryon density , and @xmath43 for the baryon - to - photon ratio .",
    "the wmap data also provide estimates of @xmath44 for the dark matter density and @xmath45 for the dark energy density .",
    "these imply , respectively , that ordinary ( baryonic ) matter makes up only @xmath2920% of all matter and that the expansion of the universe is presently accelerating .",
    "besides the cosmic microwave background , the other relic of the big bang is the abundance distribution of the light nuclides @xmath18h , @xmath19he , @xmath20he and @xmath21li . obviously , it is of utmost importance for any useful cosmological model that these two signatures provide a consistent description .",
    "when the universe was less than 0.5  s old , at temperatures of @xmath46 gk , the energy density was dominated by radiation ( photons and neutrinos ) . the process @xmath47 equilibrated the electron and neutrino gases , while the weak interactions @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 coupled the electron and neutrino gases to the baryon gas . in equilibrium",

    "s , when @xmath533  gk , the decay of free neutrons to protons , with a half - life of @xmath55  s @xcite , becomes the dominant weak interaction . as will be seen below , further expansion and cooling gave rise to the onset of primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "this stage is reached at a temperature and density of @xmath530.9  gk and @xmath56 g @xmath32 , respectively , near a time of @xmath29200  s , when nuclear reactions can compete with the destruction of nuclei by photons from the high - energy tail of the planck distribution . by this time ,",
    "the decay of free neutrons gave rise to a neutron - to - proton number ratio of about @xmath57 .",
    "the subsequent nuclear reactions are relatively fast and , for reasons given below , nearly all neutrons are incorporated into the tightly bound species @xmath20he , while only very small amounts of other nuclides are synthesized . under such conditions ,",
    "the primordial @xmath20he abundance can be estimated by using a simple counting argument : for a ratio @xmath58 , two out of each eight nucleons will end up bound in @xmath20he .",
    "consequently , we find for the predicted primordial helium mass fraction a value of @xmath59 . from the above arguments it is apparent that the primordial @xmath20he abundance is determined by the weak interaction cross sections ( which are normalized by the neutron half - life ) , the neutron - proton mass difference , and the expansion rate , but is rather insensitive to either the baryon density or to any nuclear reaction cross sections",
    ". observations of @xmath12he in metal - poor clouds of ionized hydrogen ( h ii ) in dwarf galaxies reveal that there is a small contribution from stellar nucleosynthesis and that it is correlated with metallicity .",
    "extrapolation to zero metal abundance yields an observed primordial @xmath12he mass fraction of @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the agreement with the predicted value can be regarded as a key piece of evidence for the standard cosmological model .    for a time window of @xmath292001000",
    "s after expansion began , corresponding to temperatures and densities of @xmath530.90.4  gk and @xmath61 g @xmath32 , respectively , the early universe passed through an epoch of nucleosynthesis .",
    "note that the cosmic microwave background radiation and primordial nucleosynthesis probe very different eras of the cosmic expansion .",
    "initially , at the higher temperature end , the strong and electromagnetic interactions are sufficiently fast to ensure ( quasi - static ) equilibrium among the abundances of the light nuclides @xmath62h , @xmath11h , @xmath11he , @xmath12he , @xmath63li and @xmath63be . as the universe expands and cools , the nuclear reactions slow down , both because there is a decrease in the density and because the coulomb barriers become harder to overcome .",
    "as a result , individual reactions freeze out of equilibrium at characteristic values of temperature .",

    "in contrast to what is usually found in many stellar astrophysics textbooks , no single power law for a mass - luminosity relationship fits the entire main sequence .",

    ", one finds @xmath97 .",
    "consequently , the larger the mass of a star , the faster it evolves and eventually dies .",
    "indeed , the duration of the main sequence phase decreases dramatically for massive stars .",
    "for instance , a star like the sun spends about 10 gyr at this stage , fusing @xmath29600 million tons of hydrogen to helium per second .",
    "a star with only a tenth of a solar mass would require about 3 trillion years to consume its hydrogen fuel , a time that is much longer than the current age of the universe .",
    "in sharp contrast , a star of 100 m@xmath87 would invest only 200,000 yr on the main sequence .",
    "moreover , since radioactive dating yields a value of 4.6 gyr for the age of the solar system , it is expected that the sun will spend another @xmath98 gyr on the main sequence .",
    "one of the natural consequences of h - burning is the fact that the central layers of a star become progressively enriched with he .",
    "actually , once the central hydrogen content is exhausted , the he - rich region can again gravitationally contract toward a new equilibrium configuration . depending on its mass ,",
    "a star can either become a stable _ he white dwarf _ or reach sufficiently high temperatures to fuse helium to carbon ( sect .",
    "this requires temperatures near @xmath99 k because of the larger coulomb barrier associated with the @xmath12he nucleus . as a result ,",
    "the star is again stabilized , winning its second match against gravity .",
    "it is also worth noting that the overall duration of the he - burning phase , about 100 myr for a 1 m@xmath87 star @xcite , is shorter that the main sequence stage .",
    "this is because helium fusion produces less energy per gram of fuel than hydrogen fusion .",
    "helium burning results in a carbon- and oxygen - rich core .",
    "central he exhaustion forces the stellar co - rich core to contract , rising once more its temperature .",
    "stars with masses up to 8 m@xmath87 are not able to achieve sufficient temperatures to ignite another burning episode . for instance",
    ", carbon burning requires about @xmath100 gk .",
    "hence , such stars end their lives as _ co white dwarfs _ , representing stellar remnants of planetary size that are supported by the pressure of degenerate electrons .      during h - burning ,",
    "four protons are transformed into a single @xmath20he nucleus , with an energy release of 26 mev per process .",
    "this is accompanied by the emission of two positrons and two neutrinos .",
    "two major modes for h - burning are possible in principle .",
    "the first one is called _ proton - proton _ ( or @xmath101 ) chains and it is the dominant mode at low temperatures or in low metallicity environments .",
    "this burning regime is initiated by the reaction @xmath102 , where @xmath103 denotes a positron .",
    "alternatively , two protons may fuse via the @xmath104-reaction , @xmath105 .",
    "the latter reaction depends on the electron density and thus can only compete with the former for densities of @xmath106 g @xmath32 , which are usually not achieved during h - burning in low - mass stars . subsequently , deuterium and hydrogen fuse via the reaction d(p,@xmath0)@xmath11he .",
    "this can be followed either by @xmath11he(@xmath11he,2p)@xmath12he ( pp1 chain ) , @xmath11he(@xmath12he,@xmath0)@xmath63be(e@xmath107,@xmath7)@xmath63li(p,@xmath12he)@xmath12he ( pp2 chain ) , or @xmath11he(@xmath12he,@xmath0)@xmath63be(p,@xmath0)@xmath108b(@xmath67)@xmath108be@xmath109he+@xmath12he ( pp3 chain ) .",
    "the relevance of each particular chain depends critically on the temperature as well as on the @xmath12he content . in the sun",
    "the central temperature amounts to 15.6 mk @xcite and about 90% of the nuclear energy is produced via the pp1 chain .",
    "the second h - burning regime are the _ cno - cycles_. they require somewhat higher temperatures than the pp - chains , as well as the presence of suitable amounts of cno - nuclei , which act as _ catalyzers_. because of the larger temperature dependence of the energy production rate through the cno - cycle , as compared with that of the pp - chains , the cno - cycle becomes the dominant mode above @xmath2920  mk .",
    "hence , the pp - chains dominate the energy production during h - burning in low - mass stars , whereas the cno - cycles become the chief regime in massive stars , which are characterized by a higher central temperature .",
    "since @xmath110c is the fourth most abundant nuclide and proton captures destroy @xmath110c much faster than @xmath15o ( which is the third most abundant nuclide , see fig .",

    "similar discrepancies are obtained between theoretical predictions from solar models with improved abundances and the corresponding measurements of a suite of physical properties of the deepest layers of the sun ( probed through helioseismology measurements with high penetrative , low - degree modes ) , of neutrino fluxes , or even of the solar system age . in all cases , models computed with higher solar metallicities ( as in grevesse & sauval @xcite )",

    "eventually , the ashes from the previous core burning stage begin to fuse , providing a new source of nuclear energy and thus halting temporarily the contraction of the stellar core .",
    "the duration of each subsequent advanced burning stage decreases significantly .",
    "for example , while hydrogen burning may last several million years , core silicon burning may last only one day .",
    "the reasons are twofold .",
    "first , hydrogen burning releases far more energy per unit mass compared to subsequent burning stages and , hence , the hydrogen fuel is consumed much slower .",
    "second , the manner by which the star radiates energy ( or  cools \" ) changes dramatically . for hydrogen and helium burning , the nuclear energy generated in the core",
    "is carried by photons , which scatter many times on their way to the surface before being emitted from the star . beyond helium burning ,",
    "most of the stellar energy is radiated as neutrino - antineutrino pairs , produced via electron - positron pair annihilation ( @xmath136 ) or the photo - neutrino process ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "since the neutrino energy losses increase dramatically during the advanced burning stages and the neutrinos escape freely from the star , the evolution of the massive star accelerates rapidly . at the end of silicon burning",

    "eventually the helium in the core is exhausted , the core contracts again , and the star ascends the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) . at this time , stars with masses of @xmath140 experience a second dredge - up event , which carries products of shell hydrogen and core helium burning to the stellar surface .",

    "the helium eventually ignites in a thermal pulse ( instability ) . the sudden energy release produced by such a pulse drives convection within the helium - rich intershell and extinguishes the hydrogen burning shell .",
    "the star expands and cools until the thermal pulse quenches . at this point ,",
    "the convective envelope reaches deep into the intershell region , carrying the products of helium burning ( mainly carbon , but also elements heavier than iron ; see below ) to the stellar surface ( third dredge - up ) .",
    "after a thermal pulse , the ashes of helium burning settle onto the core and the hydrogen burning shell reignites .",
    "the cycle described above may repeat many times , with a period on the order of about 10@xmath141 y. this evolutionary stage is called the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) . during the interpulse phase , in stars with masses of @xmath140 , the base of the convective envelope reaches down to the top of the hydrogen burning shell , with temperatures in excess of about 50 mk ( hot bottom burning ) .",

    "tp - agb stars experience a significant mass loss via strong stellar winds , thereby enriching the interstellar medium with the products of their nucleosynthesis .",
    "the observational counterparts belong to the spectroscopic class m and are called ms , s , sc or c(n ) stars , depending on their spectral properties .",

    "the abundance of any nuclide in nse is independent of initial composition or thermonuclear reaction rates , but is instead given by its nuclear properties , such as binding energy , mass and spins .",
    "in fact , these properties are well - known for the nuclides participating in explosive silicon burning @xcite . for known nuclear properties ,",
    "the abundance of any nuclide in nse is determined by three independent parameters : temperature , density , and neutron excess .",

    "the fate of matter in nse depends on the subsequent expansion as the gas quickly cools and , consequently , nuclear reactions will start to fall out of equilibrium at a certain freeze - out temperature .",

    "if the density or expansion time scale are sufficiently small , nse predicts a relatively large light particle abundance , especially for @xmath8-particles .",
    "when the temperature falls below the freeze - out temperature , the @xmath8-particles can not be converted fast enough to iron peak nuclei in order to maintain nse .",

    "the next zone encountered by the shock , still composed mainly of @xmath177si , is heated to temperatures in the range of @xmath5345 gk . instead of global equilibrium among all species , equilibrium is established locally in two mass ranges : the region centered on silicon , and the iron peak . this local equilibrium in each of these regions",
    "is called _ quasi - equilibrium _ ( qse ) .",
    "the abundance of any nuclide in qse , for example , with @xmath177si , is specified by four parameters ( apart from nuclear binding energies , masses and spins ) : temperature , density , neutron excess , and the abundance of @xmath177si @xcite .",
    "when the shock first encounters this zone , it starts to dissociate silicon and neighboring species , quickly forming a qse cluster in equilibrium with the dominant species @xmath177si , which has the largest binding energy of all nuclides in this region .",
    "soon thereafter another qse cluster forms in the iron peak region , which consists of nuclides of even higher binding energies , mediated by reactions in the @xmath201 mass range linking the two clusters .",
    "if sufficient temperatures and time would be available , all of the silicon group species would be transferred to the iron peak and nse would be established .",
    "however , the expansion causes the freeze - out to occur before nse can be established .",
    "since a significant amount of @xmath177si remains , the process is referred to as _ incomplete silicon burning _",
    "the major products of this burning are iron peak species , @xmath177si , and intermediate - mass nuclides .",
    "subsequently , the shock reaches a zone composed mainly of @xmath15o ( fig .",

    "explosive oxygen burning occurs mainly at temperatures in the range of @xmath5334 gk .",
    "the character of the burning is similar to incomplete silicon burning , in the sense that the fuel ( @xmath15o ) is dissociated , giving rise to two qse clusters in the mass regions of silicon and the iron peak .",
    "however , since the peak temperature is lower , less matter is converted to the iron peak and much more material remains locked in the silicon region .",

    "about one hour after core collapse , the shock , traveling at an average speed of several thousand kilometers per second , reaches the stellar surface .",
    "the sequence of events sketched above depends sensitively on all factors that influence the mass - radius relation ( or density profile ) of the pre - supernova star , since it determines the amount of matter exposed to the four explosive burning episodes .",
    "for example , the treatment of convection is important in this regard , because it impacts the size of the convective regions and the mixing efficiency in those zones .",

    "furthermore , the magnitude of the time delay between core collapse and the revival of the shock impacts the amount of matter located in each compositional layer .",
    "besides the mass - radius relation , the neutron excess ( or @xmath209 ) profile of the pre - supernova star is crucial for the outcome of those explosive burning episodes that take place under the conditions of nse and qse . the neutron excess profile , in turn ,",

    "the classical r - process has also been applied for reproducing or predicting abundance ratios of neighboring nuclides , for example , for nuclear chronometers @xcite or isotopic anomalies in primitive meteorites @xcite .",
    "such abundance ratios are most likely influenced by nuclear properties rather than by the details of the astrophysical r - process site .",

    "it is worthwhile to visualize the results of a _ dynamic _ r - process calculation as opposed to the static model described above .",
    "clearly , in reality the temperature and neutron density will change with time .",
    "early during the r - process , the temperature and neutron density will be sufficiently large to ensure that ( n,@xmath0)@xmath296(@xmath0,n ) equilibria hold in all isotopic chains .",
    "suppose now that the temperature and neutron density decrease with time .",
    "the abundance flow will continuously adjust to the new conditions according to the waiting point approximation .",
    "thus the r - process path , defined by @xmath245 and @xmath297 , must continuously move , starting from a location closer to the neutron drip line to one that is located closer to stability . for each location of the path , the @xmath292-decay",
    "half - lives are different . when the neutron flux ceases , the r - process nuclei decay towards stability .",
    "it is apparent that only the r - process path just before freeze - out , and in particular the sections near neutron magic nuclei , matters for the observed final distribution of r - abundances . in other words , at freeze - out the r - process has mostly forgotten its earlier history .",
    "furthermore , if the condition of an instantaneous termination of the neutron flux is relaxed , additional nuclear processes that may occur during the freeze - out will likely become important .",
    "for example , neutron capture reactions and @xmath68-delayed neutron decays ( apart from @xmath292-decays ) may alter the final composition .",
    "in addition to studying the solar abundance distribution , important clues regarding the r - process are provided by stellar spectroscopy of metal - poor ( and thus very old ) galactic halo stars @xcite .",
    "for example , observed elemental abundances for the remarkable halo giant star cs 22892 - 052 are shown in fig .",

    "this implies that most of the heavy elements observed in those stars were synthesized by the r - process early during the evolution of the galaxy , with no apparent contribution from the s - process .",
    "since the r - process elements could not have been synthesized in the halo stars themselves , they must have been produced by progenitors that evolved very rapidly and that ejected the matter into the interstellar medium before the formation of the currently observed halo stars .",
    "in fact , these stars formed so early in the history of the galaxy that they may have received contributions from only one , or at most a few , r - process events .",
    "the most likely r - process sites seem to be associated with massive stars since low - mass or intermediate - mass stars evolve on much longer time scales .",
    "the agreement in abundances above @xmath165135 shows that the r - process mechanism is robust , in the sense that a similar abundance distribution pattern is produced in each r - process event .",

    "the slow process @xmath303@xmath304 is the first reaction to fall out of nse .",
    "the situation is similar to the @xmath8-rich freeze - out ( sec .",

    "there is again an excess of @xmath8-particles and these can not be consumed fast enough by the slow helium - induced reactions in the time available",
    ". the important difference , however , is that there is now a neutron excess .",
    "both the abundant @xmath8-particles and the neutrons will participate in the buildup of heavier nuclei , starting with the sequence @xmath306 , and so on . without the presence of neutrons , the @xmath8-rich freeze - out produces mainly the @xmath307 isotope @xmath4ni , while the flows beyond the iron peak would be negligible ( sec .",
    "[ expnucsec ] ) .",
    "the capture of neutrons has the important effect of shifting the abundance flow towards the stability valley , where the nuclei are more neutron - rich , thus extending the flow beyond the iron peak up to @xmath165110 .",
    "the most important processes in the buildup of these heavy nuclei are ( @xmath8,n ) and ( n,@xmath0 ) reactions .",
    "this neutron - rich , @xmath8-rich freeze - out is referred to as the _ @xmath8-process _ ; ( iv ) at a temperature near @xmath533  gk , the @xmath8-particle induced reactions become too slow to change the composition of the matter and the @xmath8-process ceases . at this time",
    ", the composition resides in @xmath8-particles ( mostly ) , neutrons and seed nuclei in the @xmath16550110 mass range .",
    "if the neutron - to - seed ratio is sufficiently large , an r - process can be launched while the matter further expands and cools .",
    "the r - process model described above has the advantage that the properties of the neutrino wind are determined by the proto - neutron star , not by the pre - supernova evolution . on the one hand",
    ", this implies that r - processing in this site should produce similar abundances for events involving proto - neutron stars of the same mass . on the other hand",

    "it is crucial for a successful r - process that the preceding @xmath8-process is not too efficient .",
    "otherwise , too many heavy seed nuclei are produced and too many neutrons are consumed , resulting in insufficient neutron - to - seed ratios for synthesizing nuclides up to @xmath165200 during the subsequent r - process .",
    "this requirement translates into relatively high entropies ( or low densities ) in the neutrino - driven wind so that the @xmath303@xmath308 reaction is less efficient in converting @xmath8-particles to heavier nuclei .",
    "a fast expansion time scale limits the duration over which the freeze - out operates and is also helpful for reaching a high neutron - to - seed ratio . to summarize , an appropriate combination of low electron mole fraction , high entropy ( i.e. , high temperatures and low densities ) , and short expansion time scales is a necessary condition for a successful r - process in the neutrino - driven wind model .    some studies have attempted to reproduce the solar system r - process abundance distribution by assuming a superposition of many individual contributions in the neutrino - driven wind , each representing an appropriate combination of electron mole fraction , entropy and expansion time ( see , for example , ref .",
    "it was found that the component with the heavier r - abundances ( @xmath309 ) , including th and u , could be reproduced for electron mole fractions below @xmath2790.48 for modest entropies ( @xmath310300 ) .",
    "furthermore , it could be confirmed that the waiting point and steady flow approximations of the classical r - process apply locally ( but not globally ) over certain mass regions in the dynamic simulations .",

    "novae _ and _",
    "supernovae_.    the understanding of the physics that gives rise to the sudden luminosity burst characterizing novae has motivated vivid discussions .",
    "probably the first explanation that underscored the real mechanism powering nova explosions appears in newton s _ principia mathematica _ : _  so fixed stars , that have been gradually wasted by the light and vapors emitted from them for a long time , may be recruited by comets that fall upon them ; and from this fresh supply of new fuel those old stars , acquiring new splendor , may pass for new stars . \" _ indeed , the concept of revitalization of old stars by fresh supply of new fuel ( although not by comets ) is at the base of the thermonuclear runaway model , in which mass accretion plays a central role .",
    "but the basic picture that define nova outbursts emerged from a number of observational breakthroughs in spectroscopy ( the discovery of neon lines in nova persei 1901 @xcite , revealing the existence of several nova types ) and photometry ( the interpretation of the dips in the optical light curves as caused by dust forming episodes @xcite , or the discovery of the binary nature of nova systems @xcite ) .",
    "all in all , even though the observed features were soon interpreted as produced by the ejection of a shell from a star @xcite , the explanation of the mechanism that causes the burst had to wait until mid 20th century .",
    "indeed , its thermonuclear origin was first theorized by schatzmann @xcite , and cameron @xcite ( see also gurevitch & lebedinsky @xcite , and references therein ) , while the first hydrodynamic simulation of a nova outburst was performed by sparks @xcite .",
    "novae have been observed in all wavelengths , except in @xmath0-rays100 mev detected in the symbiotic binary v407 cygni , attributed to shock acceleration in the ejected nova shell after interaction with the wind of the red giant , was reported by the fermi - lat collaboration @xcite . ] .",
    "they constitute a very common phenomenon , representing the second most frequent type of thermonuclear explosion in the galaxy after type i x - ray bursts .",

    "this basic picture emphasizes the key role played by the initial @xmath110c content as the main trigger of the thermonuclear runaway .",
    "indeed , the reaction @xmath110c(p,@xmath0)@xmath66n determines the amount of mass accreted in the envelope and the pressure at the envelope s base , which in turn determines the strength of the outburst ( i.e. , peak temperature , mass and velocity of the ejected shells ) .",
    "note that the rates for this reaction seem to be well established at all temperatures @xcite .    from the nuclear physics viewpoint , novae",
    "are unique stellar explosions .",

    "the delay in the optical emission could be explained by travel - time differences between the x - rays directly emitted by the source , and those that hit the disk or the secondary and subsequently are scattered down in energy and become optical photons .",

    "about 40 binaries of this type have been discovered to date @xcite , although the number of systems expected to merge in less than the age of the universe within a distance of @xmath427 kpc from the sun could be as high as @xmath29850 @xcite .",
    "this results from the relatively high expected number of these binaries , with an estimated neutron star  white dwarf formation rate that is about 1020 times larger than what is predicted for double neutron stars @xcite .    a neutron star  white dwarf binary is expected @xcite to form after an explosion of a massive primary star in a core - collapse supernova ( sec .",

    "this depends critically on a number of parameters , including the mass ratio between the stellar components .",
    "the final evolution is governed hereafter by the secondary , which undergoes severe mass - loss episodes during its red giant phase , and ends up as a white dwarf .",
    "two classes of neutron star - white dwarf binaries can be distinguished @xcite : _ intermediate - mass binary pulsars _ , characterized by very eccentric orbits and masses of the secondary stars ranging between 0.51.1 m@xmath87 , and _ low - mass binary pulsars _ , with almost circular orbits and masses of the secondaries between 0.15 and 0.45 m@xmath87 .",

    "simulations of these compact star mergers are scarce and despite their interest as potential nucleosynthesis sites , most of the efforts have focused on their role as future laboratories for gravitational wave studies .",
    "after coalescence , theses systems evolve into a configuration clearly resembling that discussed for a double white dwarf merger , with a a central compact object ( a neutron star , in this case ) surrounded by a heavy keplerian , self - supported accretion disk @xcite . the expected gravitational wave emission from those systems bears also a clear resemblance to that of a double white dwarf merger , with a short chirping phase detectable by the future lisa interferometer up to an estimated distance of about 250 kpc .",
    "even though the simulations performed to date face severe limitations ( e.g. , no post - newtonian corrections , and very limited nuclear reaction networks ) , some interesting results have already been obtained . in particular , it has been estimated that the mass ejected from these systems amounts to about @xmath429 of the overall system mass assuming a merger of a 1.4 m@xmath87 neutron star and a 0.6 m@xmath87 white dwarf @xcite .",
    "further studies aimed at determining the nucleosynthesis impact of these mergers on the galactic abundances are clearly needed .",
    "mergers of stellar binaries containing double neutron stars , or a neutron star and a black hole , have been extensively studied as r - process nucleosynthesis sites , as potential sources of gravitational waves , and as the central engines for powering short @xmath0-ray bursts .    to date",

    "black hole mergers is highly uncertain , with estimates varying by orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , with one of the stars being a black hole , these systems are expected to play a minor role in the chemical evolution of the galaxy .",

    "the first fully general relativistic calculations of such mergers were performed by shibata and coworkers @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that two complementary general relativistic formulations are presently used , the _ baumgarte - shapiro - shibata - nakamura ( bssn ) _ formulation , and the _ generalized harmonic _ formalism ( see refs .",

    "it has been suggested that the contribution of these mergers to the galactic inventory of chemical species can proceed through three different processes : ( i ) direct ejection , ( ii ) neutrino - driven winds , and ( iii ) disk disintegration .",
    "lattimer & schramm @xcite first provided estimates of the fraction of a neutron star that becomes unbound after a neutron star  black hole merger .",

    "more realistic simulations @xcite yield a mean ejected mass of @xmath432 m@xmath87 , with a mean electron mole fraction in the range of 0.01 @xmath433 0.5 .",
    "neutrino - driven winds emitted by the merger remnant are considered a promising alternative to the more traditional core - collapse supernovae as a production site for r - process nuclei ( see refs .",
    "@xcite , and sect .",
    "[ grbsn ] ) .",
    "simulations suggest that such neutrino - driven winds drive ejection of about @xmath434 m@xmath87 of matter with @xmath435 per event @xcite . finally , the disk resulting after the merging episode may give rise to the ejection of neutron - rich material , either through viscous heating in an advective disk or through the energy produced during recombination of nucleons into nuclei @xcite .",
    "it has been claimed that about 0.03 m@xmath87 of moderately neutron - rich material ( 0.1 @xmath433 0.5 ) may be ejected from the disk @xcite .",
    "first estimates of the impact of such double neutron star mergers on the galactic nucleosynthesis @xcite yielded a promising agreement with the observed r - process pattern beyond ba .",
    "however , this was questioned by detailed inhomogeneous chemical evolution studies @xcite on the basis of the low expected frequency of such mergers .",
    "the reasons included a lack of consistency between the theoretical predictions and observations at very low metallicities , and the fact that injection of r - process material produced by a single merger would lead to a scatter in the ratios of r - process and fe abundances at times too long compared to observations . while core - collapse supernovae seem to be favored as the main r - process site ( sec .",
    "[ rprocsec ] ) , a contribution from neutron star mergers and the existence of multiple r - process sites still remain open questions .",
    "we have addressed so far the origin of most nuclides , except of the light species @xmath436li , @xmath437be , @xmath438b and @xmath238b . their solar abundances are smaller by about 6 orders of magnitude compared to other light nuclides ( although their abundances are much larger compared to almost all s- , r- , or p - nuclides ) . as was the case for @xmath62h and @xmath63li , their cross sections for proton - induced reactions are so large , because of the small coulomb barriers , that they are destroyed during the hydrogen burning phase in stellar interiors already at temperatures below a few million kelvin .",
    "in fact , under such conditions their mean lifetimes amount to less than a few gyr . on the other hand , standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( sec . [ bbn ] )",
    "produces only negligible amounts of @xmath436li , @xmath437be , @xmath438b and @xmath238b , with predicted number abundances less than 4 orders of magnitude compared to @xmath63li @xcite .",
    "their origin seemed so obscure that they were attributed in the seminal work of burbidge , burbidge , fowler and hoyle @xcite to some unknown  x process \" . among the suggestions made in that work was the production by spallation reactions involving high - energy protons , neutrons or @xmath8-particles of energies in excess of 100 mev per nucleon on abundant cno nuclei in stellar atmospheres . while it was convincingly demonstrated that the energy available during the t tauri phase of young stars is insufficient to produce the light nuclides in stellar atmospheres @xcite , the association of lithium , beryllium and boron synthesis with spallation reactions proved correct .",
    "an important piece of evidence was uncovered around 1970 , when it was pointed out that in the solar system the ratio of number abundances for li , be and b compared to c , n and o amounts to @xmath2910@xmath439 , while the value in galactic cosmic rays is near @xmath290.2 @xcite .",
    "consequently , the idea was born that the source of li , be and b are spallation reactions between galactic cosmic rays and nuclei in the interstellar medium .",
    "the conjecture is supported by the observation that the spallation cross sections of protons and @xmath8-particles on c , n and o nuclei at energies in excess of 100 mev per nucleon favor the production , in decreasing order , of b , li and be @xcite .",
    "the observed galactic cosmic ray abundances of these light species exhibit the same exact ordering .",
    "more information on abundances and associated spallation cross sections is provided in fig .",
    "[ figcr ] .",
    "first quantitative models @xcite , based on measured spallation cross sections , showed that this scenario could reasonably account for the abundances of @xmath436li , @xmath437be and @xmath438b observed in the solar system and in stars after 10 gyr of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "li must have been produced by some stellar source ( classical novae or agb stars ) .",

    "data are adopted from ramaty et al .",
    "note the decreasing sequence of b , li and be .",
    "[ figcr ] ]    on the other hand , @xmath21li and @xmath238b were considerably underproduced in the standard cosmic ray spallation scenario .",
    "it is now believed that additional mechanisms contribute to their production . during the first billion years",
    ", big bang nucleosynthesis dominates the synthesis of @xmath63li ( sec .",
    "[ bbn ] ) , while later a stellar source , perhaps classical novae or agb stars , contributed significantly to its production ( fig .",
    "[ figcr ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath63li is exceptional among all naturally occurring nuclides in that its origin can be attributed to three distinct sites : the big bang , galactic cosmic rays , and stars . in the case of @xmath238b",
    "it was found that neutrino - induced interactions with @xmath110c during core - collapse supernovae may also produce significant amounts of this species ( sec .",
    "[ sn ] ) . however , the predicted yields for the stellar production of @xmath21li and for the neutrino - induced synthesis of @xmath238b presently have large associated uncertainties .      galactic cosmic rays consist predominantly of energetic protons , @xmath8-particles and heavier nuclei , with kinetic energies up to the several 100 tev per nucleon range and beyond . their energy density amounts to about 2 ev @xmath32 @xcite and thus exceeds the energy density of star light ( @xmath440 ev @xmath32 ) . near an energy of 10 gev per nucleon ,",
    "for example , the number fractions of hydrogen , helium , cno and libeb nuclei amount to 95% , 4.5% , 0.4% and 0.07% , respectively @xcite .",
    "an energetic cosmic ray particle propagating through the galaxy faces a number of possibilities .",
    "first , it may undergo a high - energy nuclear collision ( spallation ) with interstellar nuclei .",
    "second , an energetic cosmic ray particle may slow down significantly because of many collisions with interstellar electrons .",
    "such ionization losses are responsible for the eventual deposition of cosmic ray matter into the interstellar medium .",
    "third , the cosmic ray particle may escape into intergalactic space , depending on the value of the escape length , that is , the amount of matter the cosmic ray particle traverses between its source and the galactic boundary .",
    "the escape length , which can be inferred from the abundance ratio of spallation products ( for example , li , be and b ) and target nuclei ( mostly c , n and o ) , amounts to @xmath2910 g @xmath116 for galactic cosmic rays near an energy of 1 gev per nucleon @xcite . during propagation",
    "an energetic charged particle is strongly deflected by galactic magnetic fields , such that most information regarding its original direction of motion is lost .",
    "spallation may involve a proton or @xmath8-particle with energies in excess of several mev per nucleon impinging on a heavy nucleus in the interstellar medium , of which c , n and o are most abundant .",
    "alternatively , an energetic heavy nucleus , again mainly c , n or o , may interact with interstellar h and he .",
    "a third possibility , thought to be especially important for the production of the lithium isotopes in the early galaxy when the cno abundance was small , is the spallation of @xmath8-particles with energies in the tens of mev per nucleon range with other @xmath12he nuclei of the interstellar medium .",
    "the production rate of a given libeb species , @xmath191 , expressed in terms of the number abundance ratio with respect to hydrogen , @xmath441 , is given by an expression of the form @xmath442 , with @xmath443 the average cosmic ray flux ( number of protons per cm@xmath62 and s ) , @xmath445 the average spallation cross section ( in cm@xmath62 ) , and @xmath446 the probability that after production species @xmath191 will be thermalized and retained in the interstellar medium ; the indices @xmath447 and @xmath448 denote the projectile and target , respectively , that is , protons , @xmath8-particles or cno nuclei .",
    "it is instructive to consider a simple example : a typical cosmic ray proton flux of @xmath44910  @xmath116  s@xmath9 , an average spallation cross section of @xmath450  cm@xmath62 @xcite for the production of @xmath437be , assuming energetic protons impinging on c or o nuclei near an energy of 200 mev per nucleon ( i.e. , the maximum of the spectrum ) , an abundance of @xmath451 in the interstellar medium , a probability of @xmath4521 , and integrating over a time period of @xmath208  yr , yields a value of @xmath453 .",
    "the measured solar system @xmath437be abundance from solar photosphere and meteoritic data amounts to @xmath454 @xcite , in good overall agreement with the predicted result .",
    "of course , this simple estimate does not account for the change of the @xmath437be abundance over time .",
    "the study of the li , be and b abundances , and in particular their evolution over the past several billion years , yields important clues for testing ideas regarding the nucleosynthesis in stars , for the physics of stellar outer layers , and for models of the early galaxy . moreover , the li , be and b abundance evolutions may hint at the origin of galactic cosmic rays . although it can be safely assumed that the sources of the cosmic ray particles , except perhaps those of the very highest energies , are located within the galaxy , their origin and acceleration mechanism have not found a satisfactory explanation yet .",
    "in fact , the mystery of cosmic ray origin represents a long - standing problem of foremost importance .",
    "energy arguments severely constrain the kind of candidate sources : for an assumed energy density of @xmath455 ev @xmath32 , maintained on average over the volume of our galaxy , @xmath456  cm@xmath11 , and a cosmic ray lifetime of @xmath45720 myr near 1 gev per nucleon , as derived from the cosmic ray abundances of the radioactive  clock \" isotopes @xmath438be , @xmath159al , @xmath203cl and @xmath199mn @xcite , one finds a total power of @xmath458 erg s@xmath9 . thus , galactic cosmic rays are expected to be associated with the most energetic astronomical objects .",
    "for example , a typical core - collapse supernova releases a kinetic energy of @xmath459  erg ( sec .",
    "[ sn ] ) . assuming a frequency of about two such events per century",
    "gives a power of @xmath460 erg s@xmath9 , that is , significantly larger than what is needed for accelerating galactic cosmic rays .",
    "indeed , there is now substantial observational evidence that the origin of galactic cosmic rays is related to supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "consider now the abundance evolution of @xmath437be and suppose that supernovae are the source of galactic cosmic rays .",
    "one possibility for producing this species is energetic protons or @xmath8-particles colliding with interstellar c , n and o nuclei . the production",
    "_ rate _ of @xmath437be will then depend on the cosmic ray flux and the cno abundance .",
    "the former factor is proportional to the supernova rate , @xmath461 , while the latter is proportional to the total number of supernovae up to that time , @xmath462 .",
    "consequently , the observed @xmath108be abundance at any given instant should be proportional to @xmath463 or , in other words , to the square of the metallicity ( as measured , for example , by the fe abundance ) . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath437be may be produced by energetic cno nuclei colliding with interstellar protons or @xmath8-particles . in this case , assuming a constant abundance of cno nuclei in galactic cosmic rays , the cosmic ray flux is again proportional to the supernova rate , but the h or he abundance in the interstellar medium is independent of @xmath462 .",
    "thus one would expect that the @xmath437be abundance at any given time is directly proportional to the metallicity @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a linear relationship between the @xmath437be abundance and metallicity could naturally arise if supernova - produced protons or @xmath8-particles undergo spallation reactions with cno nuclei in the same supernova s ejecta @xcite .",
    "similar arguments hold for the boron abundance evolution .",
    "observations in the 1990s of beryllium and boron in metal - poor stars were of paramount importance in this regard @xcite .",
    "unlike lithium , which exhibits the spite plateau at low metallicities ( sec .  [ bbn ] ) , the beryllium and boron abundances showed no such plateau and , furthermore , revealed a linear dependence on metallicity .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that galactic cosmic rays originate from supernova - induced energetic protons or @xmath8-particles colliding with cno nuclei of the interstellar medium ( which would give rise to a beryllium or boron abundance proportional to the metallicity _ squared _ ) .",
    "neither can the observations be explained by a cno abundance in galactic cosmic rays that , similar to the cno abundance in the interstellar medium , would increase with time ( since then the relationship between the beryllium or boron abundance and metallicity could not be _ linear _ ) .",
    "in addition , the cris instrument onboard the advanced composition explorer ( ace ) detected significant amounts of @xmath464co in galactic cosmic rays , but only very small amounts of the radioactive precursor @xmath464ni @xcite .",
    "the latter isotope decays by electron - capture ( with a half - life of @xmath465  yr in the laboratory ) , but is stable once fully stripped of its electrons and accelerated to high energies . from the observed abundance ratio of @xmath464ni and @xmath464co",
    "it can be estimated that the time delay between explosive nucleosynthesis and acceleration of radioactive @xmath464ni must exceed @xmath338  yr , when the ejecta of a particular supernova are presumably diluted and mixed in the interstellar medium .",
    "consequently , it seems unlikely that individual supernovae accelerate their own ejecta .",
    "several ideas have been proposed .",
    "a popular model is the production of galactic cosmic rays in superbubbles , which result from the evolution of massive star clusters @xcite .",
    "first , through their strong winds , the massive stars create cavities of hot , low - density , gas in the interstellar medium .",
    "the cavities increase in size with each supernova explosion , and eventually merge to create superbubbles . assuming that",
    ", in the simplest case , the composition of the metal - rich , low - density , material within the superbubble does not change with time , galactic cosmic rays could be launched from this reservoir by subsequent supernova shocks .",
    "the superbubble origin has been criticized recently and other ideas have been proposed @xcite .",
    "future developments in this field at the intersection of nucleosynthesis , astroparticle physics and galactic chemical evolution promise to be exciting .",
    "the last fifty years have witnessed extraordinary progress in the modeling of stellar evolution , as well as in our understanding of the origin of the elements .",
    "first , supercomputers have allowed astrophysicists to perform complex hydrodynamic simulations coupled with extensive nuclear reaction networks at astounding levels of resolution .",
    "indeed , last decades have seen the emergence of multidimensional simulations in many areas of stellar astrophysics research .",

    "<S> half a century has passed since the foundation of nuclear astrophysics . since then </S>",
    "<S> , this discipline has reached its maturity . </S>",
    "<S> today , nuclear astrophysics constitutes a multidisciplinary crucible of knowledge that combines the achievements in theoretical astrophysics , observational astronomy , cosmochemistry and nuclear physics . </S>",
    "<S> new tools and developments have revolutionized our understanding of the origin of the elements : supercomputers have provided astrophysicists with the required computational capabilities to study the evolution of stars in a multidimensional framework ; the emergence of high - energy astrophysics with space - borne observatories has opened new windows to observe the universe , from a novel panchromatic perspective ; cosmochemists have isolated tiny pieces of stardust embedded in primitive meteorites , giving clues on the processes operating in stars as well as on the way matter condenses to form solids ; and nuclear physicists have measured reactions near stellar energies , through the combined efforts using stable and radioactive ion beam facilities .    </S>",
    "<S> this review provides comprehensive insight into the nuclear history of the universe and related topics : starting from the big bang , when the ashes from the primordial explosion were transformed to hydrogen , helium , and few trace elements , to the rich variety of nucleosynthesis mechanisms and sites in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> particular attention is paid to the hydrostatic processes governing the evolution of low - mass stars , red giants and asymptotic giant - branch stars , as well as to the explosive nucleosynthesis occurring in core - collapse and thermonuclear supernovae , @xmath0-ray bursts , classical novae , x - ray bursts , superbursts , and stellar mergers .    </S>",
