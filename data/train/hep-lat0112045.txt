    "heavy - heavy currents are needed to calculate the zero - recoil form factors of the semi - leptonic decays @xmath9 and @xmath10 , as well as the change in the form factors away from zero recoil .",

    "because wilson fermions have the the same symmetries and fields as continuum heavy quarks , on - shell lattice correlation functions can be described with hqet .",

    "it provides an attractive extension of more familiar matching procedures , such as those based on the symanzik effective field theory  @xcite , which usually assume @xmath17 .",
    "in addition to developing the formalism , which holds to all orders in perturbation theory , we compute the one - loop terms of the matching coefficients of the leading dimension vector and axial vector currents .",
    "we present compact expressions of the integrands of the momentum integration , for the fermilab action and currents  @xcite .",

    "lattice gauge theory remains well - defined for all  @xmath19 , but one needs other tools to understand how to relate lattice observables to continuum  qcd .",
    "the obvious alternatives are the effective field theories hqet  @xcite and nrqcd  @xcite , which exploit the simpler dynamics of systems with one or more heavy quarks .",
    "the simpler dynamics also emerge in lattice gauge theory with massive fermions , so the effective theories also can be re - applied to understand lattice observables  @xcite .    in this section",
    "we show , in the case of heavy - heavy currents , how to use hqet to match lattice gauge theory to continuum  qcd .",
    "we first recall the hqet description of heavy - heavy currents in continuum qcd , paralleling the discussion in ref .",
    "we then explain what changes are needed to describe lattice gauge theory with heavy fermions .",
    "we focus on hqet because of the phenomenological importance of @xmath11 transitions ; for quarkonium the logic could be repeated with nrqcd velocity - counting rules  @xcite . unlike the standard symanzik program  @xcite , the hqet approach works even in the region where @xmath19 is no longer small . like",

    "this is typical of radiative corrections in massive lattice gauge theory  @xcite , and the phenomenon should , by now , be familiar from several explicit examples  @xcite .",
    "there are several checks on our calculations .",
    "numerical results have been tested with two or more completely independent programs .",
    "the curves behave as expected for large mass . when one mass is very small in lattice units , our results smoothly connect to the heavy - light matching factors .",
    "when both are small we reproduce results in the literature for massless fermions .",
    "we are confident , therefore , that our programs compute the one - loop coefficients correctly for intermediate values of the masses",
    ".    it does not seem especially useful to print tables of our results . in practice  @xcite",
    ", one will want to analyze many different mass combinations . to facilitate this analysis",
    ", we are making one suite of programs freely available  @xcite . that will allow the user to obtain the coefficients to suit his or her needs .",
    "as shown in appendix  [ app : dirac ] we have found a way to incorporate the rotation into the dirac algebra in a simple way .",
    "since the public program is designed around this technique , it may be relatively easy to extend it to other lattice actions , such as highly improved actions .",
    "in this paper we have set up a matching procedure , based on  hqet , for heavy - heavy currents .",
    "it is valid for all @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the heavy quarks masses and @xmath8 is the lattice spacing .",
    "the procedure holds to all orders in perturbation theory and , therefore , potentially on a non - perturbative level also .",
    "it could be applied to lattice nrqcd , although here it is applied to wilson fermions . with wilson fermions",
    "it is possible to consider the limit of small @xmath19 .",
    "then heavy - heavy hqet matching agrees with heavy - light hqet matching when the lighter quark satisfies @xmath197 , and with symanzik matching when both @xmath17 . in this way ,",
    "hqet matching is a natural and attractive extension into the regime @xmath400 , which is needed for heavy - quark phenomenology on currently available computers .",
    "the connection to heavy - light matching has an important implication for the charmed quark , whose mass is not necessarily large enough for the leading  @xmath129 corrections to be accurate enough on their own . at the same time",
    ", however , the charmed mass is small enough that @xmath401 , on currently available lattices . in this regime",
    "the mismatches of short - distance coefficients of higher - dimension operators in hqet are influenced by the standard continuum limit ( for the charmed quark ) , so they are easily kept down to the level of @xmath402 and  @xmath403 .",
    "thus , more and more of the heavy - quark expansion is recovered , for masses where the higher - dimension terms may be significant .",
    "our one - loop results for the sw action are of immediate value for lattice calculations of form factors for the semi - leptonic decays @xmath404 .",
    "indeed , our earlier one - loop results  @xcite ( which omitted the `` rotation '' terms in the current ) were used for @xmath405 in ref .",
    "@xcite , and our new results with rotation were used for @xmath406 in ref .",
    "in particular , we have obtained the blm scale  @xmath1 for the renormalization factors , which reduces the uncertainty of one - loop calculations .",
