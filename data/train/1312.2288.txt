    "we show that such a background is quite possible at certain stages of a protoneutron star ( pns ) evolution .",
    "for instance , one can discuss the matter compression in the pns core just before the hydrodynamic bounce or the phase transition of a dense medium of pns at the neutronization stage .",

    "we represent the mean numbers of @xmath4 pairs created and probabilities of all the transitions via coefficients of the corresponding bogolyubov transformations . in particular , we derive general formulas that describe the @xmath0 pair creation in the matter with linearly growing in time effective potential and study the typical case of a slowly varying matter interaction potential .    as a main application of the developed approach , we consider the @xmath10 pair creation of dirac neutrinos from the vacuum due to the compression in the core of pns before the bounce and at the neutronization stage .",
    "we show that the behavior of the effective number density at these stages of the pns evolution can be described by a slowly varying in time homogeneous effective potential .",
    "then we demonstrate that the intensity of the neutrino creation crucially depends on * *  * * the magnitude of masses of the lightest neutrino eigenstate .",
    "we also find that the momentum distribution of @xmath0 pairs is isotropic and uniform in the low - energy range ( up to @xmath11 )  dropping sharply for higher energies .",
    "we find that if the mass of the lightest neutrino is small enough , the flux of pairs of the lightest @xmath6 and @xmath7 , created from the vacuum during the stages of pns evolution , may exceed the low - energy flux of any other origin .",
    "we derive constraints on neutrino masses corresponding to the nonvanishing @xmath0 pairs flux produced from the vacuum due to the compression in the pns before the bounce and at the neutronization stage . finally , we list all the obtained results .",

    "in this summary we briefly list the main new results obtained in the present work and organize them conditionally into the following three blocks :    \\(i ) we have considered the dirac neutrino interacting with background fermions in the frame of the standard model .",
    "we demonstrate that a time - dependent effective potential is quite possible in a protoneutron star ( pns ) at the compression stage just before the hydrodynamic bounce and during pns neutronization .",
    "such an interaction is intense and must be treated nonperturbatively .",
    "for the first time , we have formulated in the framework of the quantum field theory a corresponding nonperturbative treatment of neutrino processes in a matter with arbitrary time - dependent effective potential .",
    "this allowed us to study analytically a realistic case of slowly varying effective potential . using complete sets of exact solutions of the dirac equation in the time - dependent effective potential",
    ", we have constructed the initial and final fock spaces and bogolyubov transformations between the corresponding creation and annihilation operators .",
    "we have expressed mean numbers of @xmath279 pairs created from the vacuum and the probabilities of all the transition processes via coefficients in the bogolyubov transformations .",
    "\\(ii ) a model with linearly and slowly growing effective potential that has a large difference of its initial and final values compared with the neutrino mass was studied in detail .",
    "it was shown that results obtained for this model are representative for a large class of slowly varying potentials .",
    "_ _  _ _ we have calculated differential mean numbers of @xmath0 pair created from the vacuum and have found that they crucially depend on the effective mass of a lightest neutrino .",
    "these distributions uniformly span from @xmath479 to @xmath11 energies for @xmath380 created due to the compression and from @xmath480 to @xmath2 energies for all three active neutrino flavors created due to the neutronization dropping sharply beyond this interval .",
    "we have obtained the total number and the energy density of created @xmath0 pairs and examined peculiarities in the production of different neutrino flavors and helicities .",
    "\\(iii ) we have studied @xmath0 pair production from vacuum in a pns core at the compression stage just before the hydrodynamic bounce and during the pns neutronization .",
    "it was shown that the creation of pairs of low - energy neutrinos up to @xmath11 is possible in these cases .",

    "part of these particles , depending on the flavor and helicity , are bounded in the pns while the antineutrinos of any flavor escape the pns .",
    "if the created pairs are @xmath358  then part of these neutrinos also escape the pns .",
    "only a part of these escaped neutrinos interacts directly with the uniform matter of electrons and baryons .",
    "in general , an effective potential barrier of a neutron star can affect such low - energy neutrinos and antineutrinos , causing refraction and reflection , and , in particular , change their helicity in course of a reflection .",
    "thus , accounting for the characteristic isotropic uniform distribution of @xmath0 pairs created in the low - energy range and specific properties dependent on the neutrino flavors , we have shown that one can distinguish such coherent flux from chaotic fluxes of any other origin . _",
    "_  _ _ we have derived constraints on the neutrino masses : @xmath481 , for particles created in the core compression before the bounce , as well as @xmath482 and @xmath483 for the pairs emission at the neutronization , corresponding to the nonvanishing @xmath0 pairs flux produced by this mechanism .",
    "we have examined other processes which might affect detection of this vacuum instability in the pns and found that they are negligible if the mass of the neutrino is small enough .",

    "concerning @xmath0 pairs created at the neutronization , we can conclude the following .",
    "we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ 3.21 ] ) that a filled neutrino and/or antineutrino initial state blocks the neutrino creation with the corresponding quantum number .",
    "however , we see no reason to expect that the occupation numbers of the initial distribution @xmath488 in the range of low energies being uniformly great immediately after the start of a neutronization stage . as found in ref .",
    "@xcite , the spectra of highly energetic @xmath471 and corresponding antiparticles emitted at the neutronization stage of pns are not fermi - dirac ones .",
    "in particular these spectra are pinched at low- and high- energy parts relative to the mean energy @xmath473 . for @xmath30 and @xmath489 the relaxation time to reach the thermal distribution is longer than @xmath474  @xcite .",
    "it was revealed in ref .",
    "thoburhor00 that for other neutrino species the relaxation time also exceeds @xmath474",
    ". therefore we get that the creation of low - energy @xmath279 pairs by our mechanism can not be suppressed by the pauli factor since the lowest energy states are unoccupied .",
    "it should be noted that besides the @xmath0 pair creation by the spatially homogeneous effective potential @xmath348 at the neutronization stage , we can expect that the inhomogeneity of the pns matter will affect the propagation of low - energy neutrinos escaping the pns .",
    "let us examine this effect .    for the case of the matter compression ,",
    "* *  * * we may roughly assume that the core of pns has an approximately constant density with @xmath490 .",
    "the pns core density decreases several orders of magnitude in the spherical pns crust which has the thickness @xmath491",
    "taking into account the range of neutrino momenta under consideration given in eq .",
    "( [ 4.25 ] ) , we see that all low - energy neutrinos and antineutrinos are ultrarelativistic particles .",
    "it takes @xmath492 for such particles to pass through the pns crust .",
    "the pns density of the spherical shell of the neutronization , * *  * * @xmath493 * , * is of the order of * *  * * @xmath494 . * *  * * one can assume that the density of this shell decreases significantly at a distance of @xmath495 km near the outer boundary , @xmath496 km .",
    "the neutrino and antineutrino created due to neutronization are ultrarelativistic particles as well .",
    "it takes @xmath497s for such particles to escape through the @xmath498 km  thickness of the outer shell of significant gradient .",
    "both time scales are much shorter than @xmath474",
    ". therefore we can consider process of the inhomogeneity region crossing as independent one .    to analyze this process",
    "we can assume that the effective matter density @xmath499 in the shells of significant gradient varies adiabatically from @xmath394  to @xmath52 and the corresponding gradient of the effective matter density varies smoothly .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the size of the wave packet of the low - energy neutrinos under consideration is in the range @xmath500 which is much smaller than the scale of the matter inhomogeneity .",
    "one can accordingly describe the macroscopic part of these shells using the time - independent one dimensional effective matter density @xmath501 that depends only on a radial coordinate @xmath502 orthogonal to the border and represents a kind of potential step .",
    "we assume that the density @xmath503 varies smoothly from the value @xmath504 in the core to @xmath505 in the space outside the shell under consideration with a constant gradient @xmath506 .",
    "thus one can treat the effect of the border using the dirac equation ( eq : direq ) with the matter density @xmath507 .",
    "such an equation is quite similar to the dirac equation for the electron in an electric field given by scalar step potential , where @xmath508 and @xmath509 play roles of these potential and constant electric field , respectively .",
    "the gradient @xmath510 is considerably larger than above mentioned @xmath511 during the * *  * * compression stage , @xmath512 , and during the neutronization , @xmath513 .",
    "hence such a field is very strong for the both subcritical masses given by eq .",

    "it can be shown that the expression given by eq .",
    "( [ 5.3 ] ) is valid in the range of the energy @xmath524 @xmath525 and the value of @xmath526 is negligible outside this range .",

    "thus , despite the fact that the vacuum instability effects caused by the pns shells of density gradient are very pronounced for the neutrinos with the subcritical masses ( in this case @xmath312 ) , they are negligible during the initial stages of the pns evolution and can not block the @xmath0 pair creation due to the time - dependent effective potential .",

    "<S> these distributions uniformly span up to @xmath1ev energies for muon and tau neutrinos created in pns core due to the compression just before the hydrodynamic bounce and up to @xmath2 energies for all three active neutrino flavors created in the neutronization . considering different stages of the pns evolution , </S>",
    "<S> we derive constraints on neutrino masses , @xmath3corresponding to the nonvanishing @xmath4 pairs flux produced by this mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we show that one can distinguish such coherent flux from chaotic fluxes of any other origin . </S>",
    "<S> part of these neutrinos , depending on the flavor and helicity , are bounded in the pns , while antineutrinos of any flavor escape the pns . </S>",
