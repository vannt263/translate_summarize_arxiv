    "it is now widely believed that the afterglow emission of gamma ",
    "ray bursts is due to the deceleration of the relativistic fireball in the circum  burst matter ( for reviews see piran 1999 ;   1999 ) .",
    "this produces a shock that accelerates electrons to random relativistic energies and probably enhances the magnetic field , leading to the production of synchrotron emission .",
    "if the magnetic field is completely tangled over the entire emission seen by the observer , the resulting synchrotron emission is unpolarized . on the other hand",
    "a very high degree of linear polarization can be expected if a fraction of the magnetic field is well ordered , reaching 6070% in the case of a completely ordered field .",
    "polarization values in the optical band in the range 330% have been indeed observed in cosmic sources , like bl lac objects and high polarization quasars ( see e.g. angel & stockman 1980 ; impey & tapia 1990 ) , whose radiation is believed to be produced by the synchrotron process .",
    "one therefore expects that also in gamma  ray burst afterglows the emission is polarized , and attempts were made to measure it .",
    "after the upper limit ( 2.3% ) found for grb  990123 ( hjorth et al .",
    "1999 ) , covino et al .",
    "( 1999 ) detected linear polarization in the afterglow of grb  990510 , at the small but significant level of 1.7@xmath10.2% .",
    "this detection was then confirmed by wijers et al .",
    "( 1999 ) who detected similar polarization values two hours and one day later .    on the theoretical side , gruzinov & waxman ( 1999 , hereafter gw99 ) and gruzinov ( 1999 ) predict values around 10% , significantly larger than observed .",
    "this estimate is based on the assumption that the overall emission reaching the observer is produced in a finite number @xmath2 of regions causally disconnected , each of which is embedded in a completely ordered magnetic field .",
    "the predicted total polarization level is @xmath3 , equal to @xmath410% for @xmath2 .",
    "gw99 discuss how the coherence length of the magnetic field generated at the external shock front of a grb fireball grows with time .",
    "if , however , the magnetic field is generated at the collisionless shock front , which is extremely local , it is not clear why the magnetic field embedded in the newly swept matter should be linked to the field in the regions behind the shock .",
    "an alternative magnetic field generation process ( and hence geometry ) has been discussed by medvedev & loeb ( 1999 , ml99 hereafter ) , who consider a magnetic field completely tangled in the plane of the shock front , but with a high degree of coherence in the orthogonal direction . in the case of a spherical fireball",
    "this geometry produces no polarization unless a part of the fireball emission is amplified and part is obscured , as is the case of interstellar scintillation . in this case , however , the resulting polarization can be much better observed at radio wavelengths and should show a rapid and erratic change of the position angle .",
    "we here propose an alternative model , in which the magnetic field geometry is analogous to that of ml99 , but in a fireball that is collimated in a cone and observed slightly off  axis . in this case",
    "the circular symmetry is broken and net polarization can be observed ( see e.g. hjorth et al . 1999 , covino et al . 1999 ,",
    "wijers et al . 1999 )",
    ". evidences for beaming of the fireball of grb  990510 from the anomalous decay of the optical lightcurve has been discussed in many recent papers ( harrison et al . 1999 ,",
    "israel et al .",
    "1999 , stanek et al .",
    "1999b ) .",
    "the key assumption of our model is that the fireball is collimated in a cone , observed slightly off  axis .",
    "the key result we obtain is the polarization lightcurve , its connection with the flux behavior and a characteristic change of 90@xmath5 in the polarization angle , making the model very testable .",
    "assume a slab of magnetized plasma , in which the configuration of the magnetic field is completely tangled if the slab is observed face on , while it has some some degree of alignment if the slab is observed edge on .",
    "such a field can be produced by compression in one direction of a volume of 3d tangled magnetic field ( laing 1980 , hereafter l80 ) or by weibel instability ( ml99 ) .",
    "if the slab is observed edge  on , the radiation is therefore polarized at a level , @xmath6 , which depends on the degree of order of the field in the plane . at the angle @xmath7 from the normal of the slab , the degree of polarization can be expressed by",
    ", following l80 : @xmath8 if the emitting slab moves in the direction normal to its plane with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath9 , we have to take into account the relativistic aberration of photons .",
    "this effect causes photons emitted at @xmath10 in the ( primed ) comoving frame @xmath11 to be observed at @xmath12 ( see also ml99 ) .",
    "we assume that in gamma  ray burst fireballs the emitting region is a slab expanding radially and relativistically , compressed along the direction of motion .",
    "we assume also that the fireball is collimated into a cone of semi  aperture angle @xmath13 , and that the line of sight makes an angle @xmath14 with the jet axis ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : geom ] ) .",
    "as long as @xmath15 , the observer receives photons from a circle of semi - aperture angle @xmath16 around @xmath14 ( i.e. within the grey shaded area of fig .",
    "[ fig : front ] ) . consider the edge of this circle : radiation coming from each sector is highly polarized , with the electric field oscillating in radial direction ( see also ml99 ) . as long as we observe the entire circle , the configuration is symmetrical , making the total polarization to vanish .",
    "however , if the observer does not see part of the circle , some net polarization survives in the observed radiation .",
    "this happens if a beamed fireball is observed off ",
    "axis when @xmath17 .",
    "the probability to observe a cone along its axis is vanishingly small , since it corresponds to a small solid angle ; it is therefore more likely to observe the collimated fireball off  axis . if the cone angle @xmath13 is small , the probability @xmath18 is approximately distributed as : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the average off  axis angle .",
    "assume therefore @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : front ] ) . at the beginning of the afterglow ,",
    "when @xmath9 is large , the observer sees only a small fraction of the fireball ( grey shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig : front ] ) and no polarization is observed . at later times ,",
    "when @xmath9 becomes smaller than @xmath22 , the observer will see only part of the circle centered in @xmath14 : there is then an asymmetry , and a corresponding net polarization flux ( horizontally line shaded region of fig .",
    "[ fig : front ] ) . to understand why the polarization angle in this configuration is horizontal ,",
    "consider that the part of the circle which is not observed would have contributed to the polarization in the vertical direction .",
    "this missing fraction of vertical polarization does not cancel out the corresponding horizontal one , which therefore survives .    at later times",
    ", as the fireball slows down even more , a larger area becomes visible .",
    "when @xmath23 , the dominant contribution to the flux comes from the upper regions of the fireball ( see fig .  [ fig : front ] ) , which are vertically polarized .",
    "the change of the position angle happens when the contributions from horizontal and vertical polarization are equal , resulting in a vanishing net polarization . at still later times , when @xmath24 , light aberration vanishes , the observed magnetic field is completely tangled and the polarization disappears .",
    "we therefore expect two maxima in the polarization lightcurve , the first for the horizontal component and the second for the vertical one .",
    "the quantitative calculation of the lightcurve of the polarized fraction has been worked out as follows .",
    "we assume that the emission of each small volume of the fireball is isotropic in the comoving frame @xmath11 .",
    "we also assume that in this frame each small element emits the same instantaneous intensity .",
    "for each ring of radius @xmath25 and width @xmath26 of fireball material around the line of sight ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : inte ] ) the relativistically enhanced monochromatic intensity has been computed as @xmath27 , where @xmath28^{-1}$ ] is the relativistic doppler factor , and @xmath29 . for @xmath30",
    "we then have @xmath31 .",
    "3 shows the geometrical set up of the system . in our calculations , the distances @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath25 are considered as angles , since all of them scale with the distance @xmath34 of the fireball from the center of explosion ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in this case",
    ", @xmath25 is equivalent to the angle @xmath7 between the velocity vector of each element and the line of sight .",
    "therefore the intensity observed from each element is a function of @xmath9 and @xmath25 .",
    "the total intensity is obtained by integrating over the entire surface of the fireball , taking into account that each ring is observed at a different angle , and then characterized by a different @xmath35 .",
    "we assume a constant spectral index @xmath36 throughout our calculations .",
    "the total intensity from the entire fireball at a given time ( and hence at a given @xmath9 ) is : @xmath37 d\\rho \\nonumber\\ ] ] the first integral corresponds to the grey shaded area of fig . 2 , and to @xmath38 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . the second integral corresponds to @xmath39 . in this case",
    "we receive radiation only from a sector of the ring , between the angles @xmath40 and @xmath41 , with @xmath40 given by : @xmath42\\ ] ]    we now compute the polarized intensity . to this aim",
    ", we consider again each element of the ring of radius @xmath25 . after calculating the corresponding viewing angle in the comoving frame",
    ", we apply eq . 1 to derive the intensity of the linearly polarized light .",
    "the position angle of the polarization produced by each element is in the radial direction .",
    "we then calculate the polarization of each ring by summing the polarization vectors .",
    "finally , we integrate over @xmath25 .",
    "it is convenient to write the polarization vector as a complex number @xmath43 and integrate it between @xmath40 and @xmath44 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : inte ] ) . here",
    "@xmath45 is the position angle of the linear polarization in the observer frame .",
    "the polarization of a generic ring is : @xmath46 since the result is a real number , the polarization direction can lie either in the plane that contains both the line of sight and the cone axis ( we call it  vertical \" polarization angle ) or in the orthogonal plane ( i.e.  horizontal \" polarization angle ) .",
    "no intermediate values are possible .",
    "integration over @xmath25 then yields : @xmath47 \\ , d\\rho \\label{eq : pola}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for simplicity , we neglected the light travel time effects introduced by the overall curvature of the emitting regions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : geom ] ) , approximating the emitting volume with a slab . since the degree of polarization of each element",
    "is divided by the total intensity of the same element , we expect these effects to be small in our case",
    ". note that to include this effect requires to assign a specific relation between @xmath9 and the observed time @xmath48 , which can be different according to different models ( due to e.g. adiabatic vs radiative evolution and/or gradients in the interstellar density ) .",
    "the result of the numerical integration of eq .",
    "[ eq : pola ] is shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lcur ] for four different values of the off  axis ratio @xmath49 . for the specific cases shown in the figure we have assumed @xmath50 , but the general properties of the polarization lightcurve",
    "are unaffected by the particular choice of @xmath13 .",
    "all the lightcurves ( except the one with the lower off  axis ratio , which shows almost zero polarization ) , are characterized by two maxima in the polarized fraction . as discussed above , at the beginning the polarization is horizontal , it reaches a first maximum and then , when the polarized fraction vanishes , the angle abruptly changes by @xmath51 .",
    "the polarized fraction raises again and then finally declines to zero at late times .",
    "the second peak has a value always larger than the first one .    by interpolating the results of the numerical integrations ( assuming @xmath36 )",
    ", we can express the maximum of the polarization lightcurve as a function of the off  axis angle : @xmath52   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is accurate within @xmath53 in the specified @xmath14 and @xmath13 ranges .",
    "this maximum always corresponds to the second peak .",
    "the scenario proposed above for the polarization behavior has a strict and direct link with the behavior of the lightcurve of the total flux .",
    "the exact connection will depend on the specific model assumed for the deceleration of the fireball ( i.e. homogeneous or radially distributed density of the interstellar medium , adiabatic or radiative regime , and so on ) , but there are general properties that can be incorporated in any model . for illustration ,",
    "assume the simplest model of a spherical fireball expanding adiabatically in a homogeneous medium , predicting that the bulk lorentz factor @xmath54 , and predicting a decay law for the flux density @xmath55 (   & rees 1997 ) , where @xmath56 is the spectral index of the radiation spectrum , i.e. @xmath57 .",
    "this law assumes that the flux is proportional to the source solid angle : if the fireball has reached a region of size @xmath34 , then the accessible solid angle @xmath58 . in the case of a fireball collimated in a cone of constant opening angle ( e.g. neglecting for simplicity the possible lateral spreading of the fireball : rhoads 1997 , 1999 ; see see also moderski , sikora & bulik 1999 ) , we will have the above relation as long as @xmath59 . on the other hand , when @xmath16 becomes greater than @xmath60 , all the cone front becomes visible , and therefore @xmath61 .",
    "this produces a steepening of the power law lightcurve decay , which now becomes @xmath62 ( see also mszros & rees , 1999 ) . at intermediate times , for which @xmath63 , the accessible solid angle increases with a law intermediate between @xmath64 and @xmath65 , producing a @xmath66 steepening in the lightcurve .    assuming again @xmath54 , and calling @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , @xmath70 the corresponding times , we simply have @xmath71 in the case of the grb  990510 afterglow , the decay laws have been @xmath72 at early times ( galama et al .",
    "1999 ) up to @xmath4 half a day after the burst event , and @xmath73 after @xmath45 days ( israel et al . 1999 ) .",
    "therefore the ratio @xmath74 is of the order of 1015 , implying @xmath49 between 0.4 and 0.45 .",
    "however , the observed steepening was larger than the value ( 3/4 ) derived above .",
    "another cause of steepening can be the lateral spreading of the fireball , as suggested by rhoads ( 1997 ) , when @xmath75 ( but see panaitescu &  1999 , who suggest that this phase should occur later ) .",
    "in addition , some steepening of the lightcurve decay may be due to a curved synchrotron spectrum : in fact at early times the spectral index derived on the basis of @xmath76 photometric observations , de  reddened with @xmath77 , was flat ( @xmath78 , 21.5 hours after the burst , stanek et al .",
    "such a flat spectral index in the optical band must necessarily steepen at higher frequencies , to limit the emitted power .",
    "an estimate of such a steepening will come from the analysis of the x  ray afterglow flux , observed from 8 to 44.5 hours after the burst ( kuulkers et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we conclude that the observed steepening of the lightcurve decay may then be the combined result of a curved synchrotron spectrum and of a collimated fireball . in this scenario , the spectral index of the late ( after 5 days )",
    "optical spectrum should be @xmath79 1.11.2 .",
    "we have proposed a model to derive the amount of linear polarization observable from a collimated fireball .",
    "we have shown that some degree of polarization can be observed even if the magnetic field is completely tangled in the plane of the fireball , as long as the fireball is observed slightly off  axis .",
    "one of the main virtues of the proposed model is in its easily testable predictions : i ) the lightcurve of the degree of polarization has two maxima ; ii ) the observable polarization position angles are fixed between the first and the second maximum , being orthogonal between each other ; iii ) there is a strong link with the lightcurve of the total flux .",
    "the degree of polarization is predicted to be moderate , reaching 10% only if we are observing a collimated fireball at its edge , and only for a short period of time",
    ". a larger degree of polarization would then suggest that the magnetic field is not completely tangled in the plane orthogonal to the line of sight , as suggested by gruzinov & waxman ( 1999 ) . up to",
    "now very few attempts have been done to measure linear polarization in optical afterglows , and is therefore premature to draw any firm conclusion from the upper limit detected in grb  990123 ( hjorth et al .",
    "1999 ) and from the positive detection in the case of grb  990510 ( covino et al .",
    "1999 , wijers et al .",
    "note however that the lightcurve behavior of grb  990510 matches our predictions , as well as the constant position angle of the observed polarization .",
    "at the time of the two first polarization measurements of grb 990510 ( made two hours apart ) the lightcurve of the total flux was decaying as @xmath80 ( stanek et al .",
    "1999a ) , i.e. it was already steepening , in agreement with our model . unfortunately , the polarization value measured one day later ( wijers et al .",
    "1999 ) was not precise enough to further constrain the proposed scenario .",
    "it will be very interesting to explore in the future the association of a gradually steepening lightcurve and the presence of polarization .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that some of the already observed afterglows can indeed be fitted by steepening power laws , but that the lack of data makes such an attempt meaningless .",
    "in addition , there are some optical afterglows ( e.g. grb 980326 , groot et al . , 1998 ;",
    "grb 980519 , halpern et al . , 1999 ) which showed a rapid decay . in these cases",
    "we may have observed only that part of the lightcurve corresponding to @xmath81 . from these considerations",
    "we conclude that grb  990510 may not be unique in its category and that a large fraction of gamma  ray burst afterglows can have some degree of optical linear polarization .",
