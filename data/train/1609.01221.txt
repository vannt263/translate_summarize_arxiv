    "additionally we use the phrase _ @xmath13 contains a @xmath0 graph at @xmath14 and @xmath15 _ to mean @xmath13 contains as a subgraph a subdivision of @xmath0 in which @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the two vertices of degree 3 .",

    "@xmath0-free _ if it does not contain @xmath0 .    the main goal of this paper is to describe all @xmath9-free graphs for large integers @xmath10 .",
    "in other words , we want to characterize all graphs that do not contain three long independent paths between any pair of vertices .",
    "this problem is in fact an instance of a very general problem ( p ) : for a given class @xmath16 of graphs , determine all minor - closed classes @xmath17 of graphs for which @xmath18 .",
    "our problem is exactly ( p ) when @xmath16 is the class of all theta graphs .",
    "there are several choices of @xmath16 for which ( p ) has been solved . along this line ,",
    "the best known results are the two obtained by robertson and seymour which solve ( p ) for the class of all complete graphs @xcite and for the class of all planar grids @xcite . the same authors also solved ( p ) for the classes of all trees , all stars , and all paths @xcite .",
    "other classes for which ( p ) is solved include the class of all wheels @xcite and the class of all double - paths @xcite .",
    "we prove that @xmath9-free graphs have the following structure : begin with a planar graph that contains no long paths outside of a special facial cycle and attach graphs that do not have long paths to the planar graph along edges , facial triangles , and certain facial @xmath19-cycles .",
    "this result is stated formally in the next section .",
    "additionally , we describe all @xmath5- , @xmath6- , @xmath7- , and @xmath8-free graphs .    our result for @xmath9-free graphs implies a result of robertson and chakravarti @xcite concerning when three specified edges of a graph are contained in a _ bond _ ( a minimal nonempty edge - cut of the graph ) .",
    "suppose we subdivide the three specified edges sufficiently many times .",
    "then it is easy to see that the three specified edges are contained in a bond in the original graph if and only if the subdivided graph contains @xmath9 .",
    "this connection easily leads to the result of robertson and chakravarti , as we will see in the next section , and it also illustrates how much our result strengthens their result .",
    "another important goal of this paper is to develop tools for dealing with various cases of problem ( p ) .",
