    "many underground experiments are currently searching for weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , which are the most popular candidates to provide the dark matter ( dm ) which is believed to make up 27% of the total mass density of the universe , and more than 90% of the halo of our galaxy .",
    "one of them ( dama@xcite ) has been observing for more than 15 years a yearly modulation effect in the low part of its energy spectrum which is consistent with that expected due to the earth rotation around the sun from the elastic scattering of wimps off the sodium iodide nuclei that constitute the crystals of its scintillators .",
    "many experimental collaborations using nuclear targets different from @xmath0 and various background  subtraction techniques to look for wimp  elastic scattering ( including lux@xcite , supercdms@xcite , coupp@xcite , picasso@xcite ) have failed to observe any anomaly so far , implying severe constraints on the most popular wimp scenarios used to explain the dama excess .",
    "a similar situation arises when confronting the excesses claimed by cdms - si @xcite ad cresst@xcite with the same constraints .",
    "however , besides the fact that several experimental uncertainties might still be advocated to question the robustness of these bounds , in most cases such conclusions are drawn by analysing direct detection data assuming elastic scattering of a wimp off nuclei with a spin  dependent or a spin  independent cross section and with a wimp velocity distribution @xmath1 as predicted by the isothermal sphere model .",
    "these assumtions may be well motivated , but represent only a very small part of the possible and experimentally viable options .",
    "for instance , if the dama effect can be explained by scatterings of wimps off sodium such constraints can be potentially relaxed by considering models where the nuclear response function of sodium on the wimp interaction is enhanced compared to that of the nuclei used to obtain the experimental bounds ( germanium , xenon , fluorine ) .    in light of the situation summarized above several new directions",
    "have been explored in the recent past both to remove as much as possible the dependence on specific theoretical assumptions ( both of particle  physics and astrophysical origin ) from the analysis of dm direct detection data and to extend its scope to a wider class of models .",
    "starting from @xcite a general strategy has been developed to factor out the dependence on @xmath1 of the expected wimp  nucleus differential rate @xmath2 at the given recoil energy @xmath3 .",
    "this approach exploits the fact that @xmath2 depends on @xmath1 only through the minimal velocity @xmath4 that the wimp must have to deposit at least @xmath3 , i.e. : @xmath5 by mapping recoil energies @xmath3 into same ranges of @xmath4 the dependence on @xmath6 and so on @xmath1 cancels out in the ratio of expected rates on different targets .",
    "since the mapping between @xmath3 and @xmath4 depends on the nuclear mass the factorization of @xmath6 is only possible in the case of detectors with a single nuclear target , or for which the expected rate is dominated by scatterings on a single target . in @xcite , after discussing the applicability and limitations of this method to the dama data , we have extended this procedure to the case when a constraining experiment contains different targets .",
    "in particular , a scenario proposed to alleviate the tension among different direct detection experiments is inelastic dark matter ( idm ) . in this class of models",
    "a dark matter ( dm ) particle @xmath7 of mass @xmath8 interacts with atomic nuclei exclusively by up ",
    "scattering to a second state @xmath9 with mass @xmath10 . in the case of exothermic dark matter",
    "@xmath11 is also possible : in this case the particle @xmath7 is metastable and down  scatters to a lighter state @xmath9 . in the idm scenario",
    "model factorization approach is more complicated that in the elastic case , because in presence of a mass splitting @xmath120 the mapping between the nuclear recoil energy @xmath3 and the minimal velocity @xmath4 that the incoming wimp needs to have to deposit @xmath3 becomes more involved than in the elastic case . in @xcite",
    "we provided the first systematic analysis of idm for a spin  independent cross section , i.e. scaling as : @xmath13 ^ 2 , \\label{eq : spin_independent}\\ ] ] with @xmath14 the wimp couplings to protons and neutrons , respectively and @xmath15 the nuclear mass and atomic number . including all available data and making use of the factorization property of the halo ",
    "model dependence we introduced some strategies to determine regions in the idm parameter space where the tension existing among different experimental results can be eliminated or at least alleviated : indeed , as shown in fig.[fig : halo_independent ] , compatibility between dama or cdms - si and all other constraints can be achieved . in the same analysis",
    ", we also showed that the same thing can be also obtained for the excess measured by cresst @xcite ( we note there that this result , which holds for @xmath16 40 gev , is still true after the low  background re - analysis of ref.@xcite ) .    on the other hand , in @xcite we have considered the effect of the inclusion of the nlo corrections calculated in @xcite in a specific scenario of light idm with the same scaling of the cross section as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spin_independent ] ) for which @xmath17 violate isospin symmetry ( isospin  violating dark matter , ivdm ) leading to a suppression of the wimp cross section off germanium targets . by incorporating this scenario in the halo",
    " independent approach also in this case , as shown in fig.[fig : isospin_violation ] , a region of the parameter space can be achieved where the cdms - si excess is compatible to other constraint .",
    "this is obtained for @xmath18 gev and @xmath11 ( exothermic dm ) .",
    "one of the most popular scenarios for wimp  nucleus scattering is a spin ",
    "dependent interaction where the wimp particle @xmath7 is a fermion ( either dirac or majorana ) that recoils on the target nucleus @xmath19 through it coupling to the spin @xmath20 of nucleons @xmath21 : @xmath22 among the main motivations of such scenario is the fact that the most stringent bounds on the interpretation of the dama effect in terms of wimp  nuclei scatterings arise today from detectors using xenon ( lux@xcite ) and germanium ( supercdms@xcite ) whose spin is mostly originated by an unpaired neutron , while both sodium and iodine in dama have an unpaired proton : if the wimp effective coupling to neutrons @xmath23 is suppressed compared to that on protons @xmath24 this class of bounds can be evaded .",
    "however this scenario is presently constrained by droplet detectors ( including coupp@xcite ) and bubble chambers ( including picasso@xcite ) which all use nuclear targets with an unpaired proton ( in particular , they all contain @xmath25 ) . as a consequence , this class of experiments",
    "have been shown to rule out the scenario of eq .",
    "( [ eq : spin_dependent ] ) also for @xmath26 when standard assumptions are made on the wimp local density and velocity distribution in our galaxy@xcite .",
    "@xmath27 plane for the compatibility factor @xmath28 defined in eqs .",
    "( 5.1,5.2 ) of ref.@xcite",
    ". @xmath291 implies compatibility between dama and other constraints .",
    "the constant value @xmath28=1 is shown for models @xmath30 , @xmath31 ( which represent generalized spin ",
    "dependent interactions including explicit momentum and velocity dependence ) , while a value close to the minimum ( @xmath32=1.7 ) is plotted for @xmath33 , which represents the standard spin ",
    "dependent interaction , for which dama and other constraints can not be reconciled . ]    in light of this , in ref .",
    "@xcite we extended the analysis of spin  dependent wimp  nucleus interactions . the most general wimp ",
    "nucleus spin  dependent interactions ca be singled out by making use of the non  relativistic effective field theory ( eft ) approach of ref.@xcite . according to @xcite the most general hamiltonian density for the wimp  nucleon process",
    "can be expressed in terms of a combination of five hermitian operators which act on the two  particle hilbert space spanned by tensor products of wimp and nucleon states ; including terms that are at most linear in the nuclear and wimp spins and quadratic on the wimp incoming velocity , the most general hamiltonian density describing the wimp ",
    "nucleus interaction can be written in terms of 15 non - relativistic quantum mechanical operators .",
    "we used this approach to classify the most general spin ",
    "dependent wimp  nucleus interactions , and within this class of models we discussed the viability of an interpretation of the dama modulation result in terms of a wimp signal , using a halo  independent approach .",
    "our main conclusions were that , although several relativistic eft s can lead to a spin  dependent cross section , in some cases with an explicit , non - negligible dependence on the wimp incoming velocity , three main scenarios can be singled out which approximately encompass them all , and that only differ by their explicit dependence on the transferred momentum .",
    "they are represented by models @xmath34",
    "( @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , and @xmath33 in fig .",
    "[ fig : generalized_spin ] . for two of them",
    "compatibility between dama and other constraints can be achieved for a wimp mass below 30 gev , but only for a wimp velocity distribution in the halo of our galaxy which departs from a maxwellian .",
    "this is achieved by combining a suppression of the wimp effective coupling to neutrons ( to evade constraints from xenon and germanium detectors ) to an explicit quadratic or quartic dependence of the cross section on the transferred momentum ( that leads to a relative enhancement of the expected rate off sodium in dama compared to that off fluorine in droplet detectors and bubble chambers ) . for larger wimp masses",
    "the same scenarios are excluded by scatterings off iodine in coupp .",
    "the results summarized in this presentation show that , when different new approaches such as the halo  dependence factorization , non  relativistic eft and inelastic scattering are combined together , conclusions which are very different to what usually claimed in the literature can be drawn .",
    "this shows that we are only starting now to scratch the surface of the most general wimp direct detection parameter space .",
