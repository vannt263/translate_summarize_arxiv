    "the third and fourth terms describe the interparticle interaction , the short - range and the spin - spin interactions , correspondingly .",
    "we consider spin-1 bose particles , thus we present the explicit form of the spin matrixes @xmath10 for particles with spin equal to 1 : @xmath13 @xmath14    starting from the many - particle schrodinger equation ( [ sdbec magn bec spin gam ] ) and using the qhd method we derive a set of equations for spinning particles in the bec state .",
    "the set of equations consists of three equations , they are the continuity equation , the euler equation giving momentum balance , and the magnetic moment ( spin ) evolution equation , which is a generalization of the bloch equation , the last one describes dynamic of single spin in an external magnetic field .",
    "the first and basic step at getting of the qhd equations from the many - particle wave function is the definition of the particle concentration @xmath15 as the quantum mechanical average of the concentration operator in the coordinate presentation of the quantum mechanics @xmath16 , so we have @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a infinitesimally small volume in 3n dimensional configurational space .",

    "general technic of the derivation of the qhd equations for the spinless particles can be found in ref.s @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in ref.s @xcite and @xcite attention",
    "was stressed on the short - range interaction of neutral particles in the bec state .",

    "the last of them arises due to the spin .",
    "if spin of all particles are parallel to each other and to an external magnetic field , we can rewrite the magnetization @xmath21 as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a unit vector in the direction of magnetic moment , which is parallel to direction of the external magnetic field , @xmath3 is the magnetic moment of particle , @xmath31 is the particle concentration . in",
    "described approximation evolution of the magnetization reduces to the particle concentration evolution .",
    "so , discussed term reduces to zero @xmath32@xmath33 , since @xmath30 is a constant .",
    "the right - hand side of equation ( [ sdbec bal imp eq full ] ) describes the force density leading to the particle evolution .",
    "the first term describes the short - range interaction in the first order by the interaction radius @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the next group of terms presents interaction of the magnetic moment with the external magnetic field and interaction between the magnetic moments ( the spin - spin interaction ) , correspondingly .",

    "the third term is the quantum part of the magnetization flow , which is an analog of the quantum bohm potential in the momentum balance equation ( [ sdbec bal imp eq full ] ) .",

    "thus , we can explicitly write the internal magnetic field @xmath37 and find that this field satisfies to the maxwell equations @xmath38 and @xmath39 consequently , the first term in the right - hand side of equation ( [ sdbec bal imp eq full ] ) can be written as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the sum of the external and internal magnetic fields . analogously , the right - hand side of the magnetic moment evolution equation appears as @xmath42 . as a result",

    "moreover , for the fully magnetized bec equations of field represent as @xmath46 and @xmath47    we can also put down corresponding nlse , which can be directly derived from couple of the continuity and the euler equations ( [ sdbec cont eq ] ) and ( [ sdbec bal imp eq fully magn ] ) ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath48 where the last term @xmath49 describes the spin - spin interaction and interaction of the magnetic moments with the external magnetic field .",
    "this term appears instead of the integral term in the generalization of the gp equation for dipolar bec ( see , for instance , ref.s @xcite and @xcite ) . an equation analogous to ( [ sdbec nlse int polariz some frame non int ] ) was obtained for the electrically polarized bec @xcite .",
    "potential energy of the spin - spin interaction was directly derived from the quantum electrodynamical scattering amplitude of two electrons @xcite .",
    "this potential energy consists of two parts .",
    "the first one is well - known appearing as a fraction @xmath50 and the second term is proportional to the dirac delta function .",

    ", the magnetic field caused by magnetic dipole should satisfy to the maxwell equations @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which differ from the maxwell equations for the electric field , the last of these equations is written in the quasi static approximation and in absence of electric currents .",

    "we are going to show that the potential energy of electric dipole interaction differs from ( [ sdbec d - d ham fraction only ] ) and ( [ sdbec pot of mm int ] ) .",
    "potential of the electric field caused by an electric dipole appears as @xmath58 @xcite , consequently the electric field has form of @xmath59@xmath60 or it can be rewritten in the tensor form @xmath61 .",
    "energy of interaction of two dipoles comes as @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the electric dipole moment of the second dipole , and @xmath64 is the electric field caused by the first dipole acting on the second dipole .",
    "explicit form of the dipole - dipole interaction energy is @xmath65 .",
    "it can be rewritten via notion of the green function @xmath66 of dipole - dipole interaction @xmath67 , where @xmath68 .    for consideration of the neutral particles having electric dipole moment @xmath69 in the bec state",
    "we derive a set of qhd equations .",

    "consequently we will simplify the euler equation and get a closed set of the qhd equations .",
    "analogously for spinning particles we find the continuity @xmath79 and the euler @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 equations , where @xmath31 is the particle concentration , @xmath27 is the velocity field , @xmath83 is the polarization of the medium , or the density of the electric dipole moment .",
    "the last term in the euler equation ( [ sdbec bal imp eq ed general ] ) contains the integral presenting internal electric field caused by the polarization of medium , this electric field has form @xmath84 we can obtain that this electric field satisfies to the maxwell equations @xmath85 and @xmath86    for the fully polarized bec of particles having electric dipole moment the euler equation ( [ sdbec bal imp eq ed general ] ) reduces to @xmath87 @xmath88 where @xmath30 is the unit vector in direction of polarization formed by external field @xmath89 .",

    "consequently , we can represent and use solutions , described above , for description of the dipolar bec .",
    "equation ( [ sdbec magn div short ] ) gives @xmath157 , where @xmath158 is the derivative on @xmath110 , so we have @xmath159 , as at infinity ( in equilibrium ) @xmath110 projection of magnetic field equals to zero .",
    "equation ( [ sdbec magn curl short ] ) leads to two relations @xmath160 and @xmath161 , the first of them gives @xmath162 .",
    "derivative of @xmath163 we put in the euler equation ( [ sdbec bal imp eq fully magn ] ) , and we find @xmath164 where @xmath165 .",
    "this equation corresponds to the spectrum of linear excitations obtained above .",
    "we see that contribution of the magnetization reveals as effective `` attractive '' changing of the short - range interaction constant .      in the unpolarized bec",
    "the bright soliton exists at the attractive short - range interaction . in considering limit",
    "the magnetization leads to additional attracting between particles , so magnetization of the attractive bec does not break condition of the bright soliton existence .",
    "we have @xmath166 , consequently @xmath167 .",
    "we see that for the system under consideration the magnetization leads to increasing of module of @xmath168 .",
    "only amplitude of the bright soliton depends on the interaction constant @xmath169 .",
    "hence , we find decreasing of the bright soliton amplitude due to the magnetization of the attractive bec .",
    "the dark soliton exists in the bec with the repulsive short - range interaction ( @xmath128 ) , hence the magnetization leads to decreasing of the effective interaction constant down to @xmath170 .",
    "first of all it reveals in the widening of the dark soliton .",
    "using of the feshbach resonance allows to change the of the interaction constant @xmath98 .",
    "thus , at small enough positive @xmath98 .",
    "contribution of magnetization can prevail .",
    "that leads to disappearing of the dark soliton , and on stability of the repulsive bec to the collapse .",
    "grey soliton solution in the unpolarized bec presented by formulas ( [ sdbec grey soliton concentration])-([sdbec grey soliton velocity ] ) . in our case",
    "we have to replace @xmath98 with @xmath168 .",
    "it changes the phase and `` amplitude '' @xmath171 of the grey soliton . to trace consequence of changing of the interaction constant we present fig.s ( 2)-(4 ) , where @xmath172 and @xmath173 are shown . from these figures",
    "we see that decreasing of the interaction constant due to magnetization leads to decreasing of the soliton amplitudes .",
    "we have the decreasing of the amplitude of the particle concentration and the amplitude of the velocity field .",
    "figure ( 4 ) allows to compare profile of the particle concentration and the velocity field .",
    "let us consider a nonlinear plane perturbation propagating parallel to external uniform magnetic field , which is directed along the @xmath100 axes . in this case space dependence of hydrodynamic variables",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath27 and the magnetic field @xmath41 reduces to dependence on @xmath100 .",
    "equation @xmath174 ( [ sdbec magn div short ] ) represents as @xmath175 , where @xmath158 means derivative on @xmath100 .",
    "we find that magnetic moments evolution gives no influence on perturbation propagating parallel to the external field in the magnetized bec , since @xmath163 only gives a contribution in the set of qhd equations ( [ sdbec cont eq ] ) and ( [ sdbec bal imp eq fully magn ] ) .",
    "using equation ( [ sdbec magn curl short ] ) we obtain that @xmath176 and @xmath177 equal to zero . finally , we have equation @xmath178 which mathematically has no difference with equation ( [ sdbec bal imp eq unpolar bec ] ) .",
    "consequently , solutions of equation ( [ sdbec bal imp eq unpolar bec ] ) presented by formulas ( [ sdbec bright soliton ] ) , ( [ sdbec dark soliton ] ) , ( [ sdbec grey soliton concentration ] ) and ( [ sdbec grey soliton velocity ] ) are valid for our case and we can conclude that at solitons propagation along direction of the external magnetic field , the external field gives no influence on properties of solitons .",
    "they depend on the short - range interaction only .",
    "this conclusion corresponds to the properties of linear excitations in the magnetized bec ( [ sdbec disp for md ] ) . from formula ( [ sdbec disp for md ] ) we see that at propagation parallel to the magnetic field @xmath179 and the last term equals to zero .",
    "thus , we have the unchanged bogoliubov spectrum .",
    "so , nonlinear perturbation receive no influence of the magnetization at propagation parallel to the external field , as it was for the linear excitations ( see section iv ) .",
    "( color online ) the figure describes the profile of the particle concentration @xmath180 in the grey soliton .",
    "we consider the dependence of @xmath180 on the reduced interaction constant @xmath181 and @xmath182 at @xmath152.,width=302 ]     ( color online ) the figure describes the profile of the velocity field @xmath183 in the grey soliton on the reduced interaction constant @xmath181 and @xmath182 at @xmath152.,width=302 ]     ( color online ) on this figure we present the profiles of the particle concentration and the velocity field on one figure to compare they structures .",
    "they are shown as functions of @xmath181 and @xmath182 at @xmath152.,width=302 ]",
    "we have described our results for the magnetized bec .",
    "let us present solitons in the fully polarized bec of molecules or atoms having electric dipole moment . as we will see they have some different properties .",
    "considering perturbation of hydrodynamic variables @xmath31 , @xmath27 , and @xmath94 are functions of @xmath184 assuming that an external electric field is applied along @xmath100 axes . therefore we consider propagation of the perturbation perpendicular to the external field .",
    "we find that the electric field gives no contribution in the evolution of the particle concentration @xmath31 and the velocity field @xmath27 , the last term in equation ( [ sdbec bal imp eq short from gp ] ) equals to zero , since @xmath185 that follows from equation ( [ sdbec field good div ] ) , and we have no difference between considered here case and the unpolarized bec .",
    "consequently , we have that soliton solutions ( [ sdbec bright soliton ] ) , ( [ sdbec dark soliton ] ) , ( [ sdbec grey soliton concentration ] ) and ( [ sdbec grey soliton velocity ] ) propagate in the electrically polarized bec perpendicular to the external field with no influence of the polarization .",
    "we now consider propagation of a nonlinear perturbation parallel to the external electric field , so we suppose that @xmath31 , @xmath27 , and @xmath94 are functions of @xmath186 . in this case",
    "the last term in equation ( [ sdbec bal imp eq short from gp ] ) appears as @xmath187 that we find using equation ( [ sdbec field good div ] ) .",
    "thus we can combine two terms in the right - hand side of equation ( [ sdbec bal imp eq short from gp ] ) , which present @xmath100 projection of the force density @xmath188 and write it in the form of @xmath189 .",
    "we have that the dipole - dipole interaction of the fully polarized electric dipoles leads to change of the interaction constant .",
    "all difference , we find in compare with the unpolarized case , is replacement of @xmath98 with @xmath190 .",
    "final form of the euler equation is @xmath191 using methods described in ref.s @xcite , @xcite we find changes of properties of the bright , dark , and grey solitons .",
    "general form of these solitons are given by formulas ( [ sdbec bright soliton ] ) , ( [ sdbec dark soliton ] ) , ( [ sdbec grey soliton concentration ] ) and ( [ sdbec grey soliton velocity ] ) , but instead of @xmath98 we should put @xmath192 containing contribution of the electric dipole moment .",
    "in contrast with the magnetization , which leads to additional effective attraction @xmath165 at the wave propagation perpendicular to the external magnetic field , the electric polarization gives an effective repulsion @xmath190 revealing at wave propagation parallel to the external electric field .",
    "consequently , polarization of the attractive bec @xmath125 leads to decreasing of the module of the effective interaction constant @xmath193 . for the bright soliton it reveals in both an increasing of the soliton amplitude ( [ sdbec bright soliton ampl ] ) and a constriction of the area of soliton existence .",
    "the dark soliton can also exist in the electrically polarized bec . at theoretical description",
    "it appears as a solution of equation ( [ sdbec bal imp eq solepbec par ] ) corresponding to formula ( [ sdbec dark soliton ] ) .",
    "increasing of the polarization leads to increasing of the effective interaction constant @xmath190 .",
    "consequently , the width of the dark soliton ( @xmath128 ) @xmath194 decreases with the increasing of polarization .",
    "the amplitude @xmath117 of dark soliton is not affected by the interaction .",
    "it is determined by the equilibrium particle concentration .",
    "let us describe changes of the grey soliton properties in the electrically polarized bec in comparison with the unpolarized bec .",
    "fig.s ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) allow to get the consequence of polarization of the bec on properties of the grey soliton . from figures ( 2 ) and ( 3 )",
    "we see that the electric polarization of the bec leads to increasing of the amplitudes of concentration and velocity field in the grey soliton . the width of the grey soliton increases as well .",
    "it happens due to increasing of the effective interaction constant @xmath190 .",
    "as a summary we recapture main results of our paper .",
    "we studied fundamental linear and nonlinear collective excitations both in the electrically polarized bec and in the magnetized bec . for this aim",
    "we have developed the qhd models for the fully polarized bec , which are simplification of the qhd models for the dipolar bec including evolution of the dipole directions we had developed in earlier papers .",
    "these models consist of the couple of qhd equations ( the continuity and euler equations ) .",
    "this couple of the qhd equations can be presented as a nonintegral nonlinear schrodinger equation , which is the generalization of the well - known gp equation on dipolar becs .",
    "the qhd equations or corresponding nonlinear schrodinger equation have to be coupled with the maxwell equations .",
    "the qhd equations for the electrically polarized bec contain an electric field caused by electric dipoles of the medium , and , correspondingly , the qhd equations describing magnetized bec contain an magnetic field caused by the magnetic moments .",
    "the electric field and the magnetic field satisfy to different pair of the maxwell equations , consequently , we get differences in properties of the two kind of the dipolar bec .",
    "these differences reveal in properties of the collective excitations obtained in the paper .",
    "generalization of the bogoliubov spectrum on the dipolar becs contains a new term caused by dipolar effects .",
    "the electric polarization gives @xmath195 , whereas the magnetization leads to @xmath196 .",
    "these differ from well - known results obtained at using of the integral generalization of gp equation for the dipolar bec .",
    "these differences are caused by mistreating of the potential energy of dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "correct forms of the potential energy for the spin - spin interaction and interaction of electric dipoles are presented in the paper .",
    "we obtained that the generalization of the bogoliubov spectrum are anisotropic .",
    "form of anisotropy is similar for both kinds of dipolar bec , but they were different .",
    "they have same form , but direction of axes of anisotropy differs on 90 degree .",
    "anisotropic terms caused by dipolar effects have differen sign .",
    "electric dipoles lead to effective repulsion , since we have @xmath197 instead of the interaction constant of the short - range interaction @xmath98 .",
    "magnetic dipoles give effective attraction , hence we obtained @xmath198 instead of @xmath98 for the unpolarized bec .",
    "our model allows to get several exact analytical soliton solutions for the dipolar bec .",
    "we found solutions for the bright , dark , and grey solitons in the electrically polarized and in the magnetized becs .",
    "we obtained solutions in cases when solitons propagate parallel or perpendicular to the external field .",
    "we discover that at propagation parallel ( perpendicular ) to the external magnetic ( electric ) field solitons in the magnetized ( electrically polarized ) bec are not affected by the magnetization ( electrical polarization ) , and they have same properties as solitons in the unpolarized bec . in opposite limits we calculated contribution of the dipolar effects in the amplitude and phase of solitons .",
    "we describe details of the calculation of the spectrum of collective excitations for the fully magnetized bec . from the continuity equation ( [ sdbec cont eq ] ) in the linear approximation , assuming that @xmath199 , @xmath200 , and @xmath201 , where @xmath117 and @xmath202 are equilibrium values of the particle concentration and the magnetic field , equilibrium value of the velocity field equals to zero , @xmath203 , @xmath204 , and @xmath205 are small perturbations of the equilibrium state , for the fourier amplitudes of the hydrodynamic variables , we find @xmath206 the euler equation ( [ sdbec bal imp eq fully magn ] ) in the linear approximation represents as @xmath207 multiplying this equation on @xmath208 and using equation ( [ sdbec cont lin ] ) in the first term we get relation between the perturbation of particle concentration and z - projection of the magnetic field , which is @xmath209 equation ( [ sdbec magn curl short ] ) gives three scalar equations @xmath210 @xmath211 and @xmath212 from the equation ( [ sdbec max curl lin z ] ) we can get @xmath213 via @xmath214 , using it and algebraic form of equation ( [ sdbec magn div short ] ) , which is @xmath215 we obtain @xmath214 via @xmath216 in the following form @xmath217 next , we put ( [ sdbec by ] ) in equation ( [ sdbec max curl lin x ] ) and find relation for @xmath216 , which is a part of the euler equation ( [ sdbec euler magn lin ] ) , via the perturbation of the particle concentration as follows @xmath218 where @xmath102 , and @xmath219 .",
    "therefore , we can write @xmath220 , where @xmath221 is the angle between direction of wave propagation given by @xmath208 and direction of the external magnetic field @xmath202 . putting ( [ sdbec formula for bz ] ) in the linearized euler equation ( [ sdbec euler via concentration ] ) we get formula ( [ sdbec disp for md ] ) .",
