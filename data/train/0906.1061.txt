    "on 2008 january 9 , a luminous x - ray transient was serendipitously discovered in ngc 2770 during the follow - up observation of sn 2007uy in the same galaxy with the _ swift _ satellite @xcite .",
    "an optical counterpart was also discovered at the position of the transient @xcite , and it was named supernova ( sn ) 2008d @xcite .    the total energy emitted at x - ray wavelengths is @xmath4 ergs , smaller than that of long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) by a factor of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the origin of the x - ray emission is being debated .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite interpreted the x - ray transient as a sn shock breakout . on the other hand , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite suggested that the transient is the least energetic end of grbs or x - ray flashes .",
    "sn 2008d is classified as type ib because of the presence of he lines @xcite while sne associated with grbs are all type ic ( without he lines ) .",
    "the progenitor star of sn 2008d has a he layer prior to the explosion , and the he core mass is estimated to be 6 - 8 @xmath2 @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of sn 2008d at @xmath6 300 days after the explosion ( nebular phases ) with the subaru telescope equipped with focas @xcite and the very large telescope ( vlt ) equipped with fors1 @xcite .",
    "we find that the spectrum of sn 2008d shows a double - peaked [ ] emission profile , suggesting that sn 2008d is a bipolar explosion viewed from near the equatorial direction .",

    "two rectangles show the regions where the galaxy spectrum is extracted .",
    "[ fig : image ] ]      a spectroscopic observation of sn 2008d was performed on 2009 january 6 ( @xmath9 days ) with the subaru telescope .",

    "blue ( 4800 - 8000  ) and red ( 6000 - 9000  ) spectra were taken separately .",
    "we used a slit of @xmath11 width and two 300 lines mm@xmath12 grisms .",
    "the slit was placed with the position angle of @xmath13 ( north - south ) .",
    "typical seeing during the observation was fwhm @xmath14 measured with star profiles in @xmath7 band .",
    "no filter was used for the blue spectrum , while the o58 filter was used for the red spectrum to eliminate second order light .",
    "the exposure time is 9000 and 3300 sec for the blue and red spectra , respectively .",
    "the wavelength resolution is @xmath15 .",
    "the observed data were bias - subtracted and flat - corrected , and then two - dimensional spectra were extracted .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed with a th - ar lamp .",
    "since the sn is located inside a brightness trough which surrounds the sn position with a diameter of @xmath16 arcsec ( see figure [ fig : image ] ) , simultaneous subtraction of the background galaxy and sky lines using the neighboring region leads to negative sn flux .",
    "thus , we first extracted a one - dimensional galaxy spectrum using the region at 3 - 12 arcsec north and south from the sn position ( marked with boxes in figure [ fig : image ] ) .",
    "then , the galaxy spectrum was subtracted using the spatial profile at 6920 - 6990  , in which the sn does not show any emission line .    to maximize s /",
    "n of the sn spectra especially at emission lines , we extracted the galaxy spectrum using a wide region .",
    "since the global color of the galaxy spectrum depends on the position somewhat , this leads to a slight over - subtraction in the extracted sn spectrum in the blue ( see figure [ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "however , the profile of the sn emission lines are not affected by the choice of integrated region for the galaxy spectrum .",
    "the background - subtracted spectra were summed into one - dimensional spectra , and then , the flux was calibrated using the spectrophotometric standard star feige 34 @xcite .",
    "the blue and red spectra were combined , weighted by the exposure time .",
    "finally , the spectrum is scaled with the @xmath7-band magnitude ( section [ sec : photometry ] ) .",

    "however , given the strong narrow emission lines from the region , the broad [ ] line of the sn could possibly be contaminated by the narrow [ ] line from the region . since the strength of the narrow [ ] line is @xmath62 of h@xmath22 around the sn position ,",

    "double - peaked profiles are also seen in other type ib / c sne @xcite .",
    "the fraction of sne showing a double - peaked [ ] line is roughly @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "since our observation is late enough for the ejecta to be optically thin , the double - peaked profile of the [ ] line is unlikely to be caused by optical depth effects @xcite .",
    "it is also unlikely to be caused by a combination of the two [ ] lines ( @xmath66 6300 and 6364 ) since the strength of the two peaks is comparable ( the strength ratio is 3:1 in optically thin limit , @xcite ) .    in addition , if the double - peaked [ ] profile were caused by asphericity in the distribution of the heating source ( @xmath1ni ) , the [ ] line would also show a double - peaked profile .",

    "[ fig : model ] ]    a simple explanation for the double - peaked [ ] profile is that oxygen has a torus - like distribution and our line of sight is near the plane of the torus ( @xcite , but see also discussion by @xcite ) .",
    "the torus - like distribution of the presupernova elements , such as oxygen and carbon , can be realized in a bipolar explosion ( see figure [ fig : model ] for a schematic picture ) , where more energy is deposited in the polar region , and nucleosynthesis takes place there ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a bipolar explosion has also been suggested for sn 2008d by polarimetric observations @xcite .",
    "nebular emission profiles from bipolar models have been examined by @xcite , and compared to nebular spectra of various sne ib / c @xcite . in the right - hand panel of figure [ fig : line ] ,",
    "the profiles calculated with a bipolar explosion model bp8 ( highly aspherical model ) by @xcite are shown for comparison .",
    "the kinetic energy of the model is @xmath67 erg ( @xmath68 defined in @xcite ) , which is smaller than that estimated for sn",
    "2008d ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is because the models of @xcite include only the c+o core . in sn 2008d , and in the models of @xcite , the he layer",
    "is present , and it contains the rest of the kinetic energy .    the line profile of sn 2008d is explained most nicely by a viewing angle of @xmath69 .",
    "the double - peaked profile is seen only when the viewing angle is @xmath3 .",
    "if the asphericity is smaller , this dividing angle is larger .",
    "since the viewing angle and degree of asphericity have a degenerate effect , we can not argue that a large asphericity as in model bp8 is preferred for sn 2008d .",
    "however , it is true irrespective of the models that our line of sight should be @xmath3 from the polar direction .",
    "if the angle is smaller , the [ ] line would show a single - peaked profile ( see sne 1998bw , 2004gq and 2002ap and models in figure [ fig : line ] ) .",
    "we have presented spectroscopic and photometric observations of sn 2008d at nebular phases .",
    "flux measurements of the narrow emission lines from the region at the site of the sn and the estimates of the local metallicity were also given .",
    "in photometric observations , the sn was detected in @xmath7 and @xmath41 .",
    "the brightness at nebular phases is consistent with the prediction of explosion models with an ejected @xmath1ni  mass of 0.07 @xmath2 , which explain the light curve at early phases .    in the nebular spectrum taken at a sufficiently late phase ,",
    "the [ ] line clearly shows a double - peaked profile , while such a profile is not seen in the [ ] line .",
    "the evolution of the profile from @xmath70 days @xcite turned out not to be significant .",
    "the double - peaked profile can not be explained by a spherically symmetric explosion , and it strongly indicates that sn 2008d is an aspherical explosion . the profile can be explained by a torus - like distribution of excited viewed from the side ( figure [ fig : model ] ) .",
