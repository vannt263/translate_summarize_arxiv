    "although the macroscopic curvature of dna induced by adenine - tracts ( a - tracts ) was discovered almost two decades ago @xcite structural basis for this phenomenon remains unclear .",
    "a few models considered originally @xcite suggested that it is caused by intrinsic conformational preferences of certain sequences , but all these and similar theories failed to explain experimental data obtained later .",
    "@xcite calculations show that the b - dna duplex is mechanically anisotropic , @xcite that bending towards minor grooves of some a - tracts is strongly facilitated , @xcite and that the macroscopic curvature becomes energetically preferable once the characteristic a - tract structure is maintained by freezing or imposing constraints .",
    "@xcite however , the static curvature never appears spontaneously in calculations unbiased _ a priori _ and these results leave all doors open for the possible physical origin of the effect . in the recent years",
    "the main attention has been shifted to specific interactions between dna and solvent counterions that can bend the double helix by specifically neutralizing some phosphate groups .",
    "@xcite the possibility of such mechanism is often evident in protein - dna complexes , and it has also been demonstrated by direct chemical modification of a duplex dna . @xcite in the case of the free dna in solution , however , the available experimental observations are controversial .",
    "@xcite molecular dynamics simulations of a b - dna in an explicit counterion shell could neither confirm nor disprove this hypothesis .",
    "@xcite here we report the first example where stable static curvature emerges spontaneously in molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "its direction is in striking agreement with expectations based upon experimental data .",
    "however , we use a minimal b - dna model without counterions , which strongly suggests that they hardly play a key role in this effect .",
    "figure [ ftj1 ] exhibits results of a 10 ns simulation of dynamics of a 25-mer b - dna fragment including three a - tracts separated by one helical turn .",
    "this sequence has been constructed after many preliminary tests with shorter sequence motives .",
    "our general strategy came out from the following considerations .",
    "although the a - tract sequences that induce the strongest bends are known from experiments , probably not all of them would work in simulations .",
    "there are natural limitations , such as the precision of the model , and , in addition , the limited duration of trajectories may be insufficient for some a - tracts to adopt their specific conformation . also , we can study only short dna fragments , therefore , it is preferable to place a - tracts at both ends in order to maximize the possible bend .",
    "there is , however , little experimental evidence of static curvature in short dna fragments , and one may well expect the specific a - tract structure to be unstable near the ends .",
    "that is why we did not simply take the strongest experimental `` benders '' , but looked for sequence motives that in calculations readily adopt the characteristic local structure , with a narrow minor groove profile and high propeller twist , both in the middle and near the ends of the duplex .",
    "the complementary duplex @xmath0 has been constructed by repeating and inverting one such motive .",
    "the upper trace in plate ( a ) shows the time dependence of rmsd from the canonical b - dna model .",
    "it fluctuates below 4 sometimes falling down to 2  , which is very low for the double helix of this length indicating that all helical parameters are well within the range of the b - dna family .",
    "the lower surface plot shows the time evolution of the minor dna groove .",
    "the surface is formed by 75 ps time - averaged successive minor groove profiles , with that on the front face corresponding to the final dna conformation .",
    "the groove width is evaluated by using space traces of c5 atoms as described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "its value is given in angstrms and the corresponding canonical b - dna level of 7.7   is marked by the straight dotted lines on the faces of the box .",
    "it is seen that the overall groove shape has established after 2 ns and remained stable later , with noticeable local fluctuations . in all a -",
    "tracts the groove strongly narrows towards 3 ends and widens significantly at the boundaries .",
    "there are two less significant relative narrowings inside non a - tract sequences as well .",
    "dynamics of @xmath1 backbone transitions are shown in plate ( b ) . the b@xmath2 and b@xmath3 conformations are distinguished by the values of two consecutive backbone torsions , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in a transition they change concertedly from ( t , g@xmath6 ) to ( g@xmath6,t ) .",
    "the difference @xmath7 is , therefore , positive in b@xmath2 state and negative in b@xmath3 , and it is used in fig .",
    "( d ) as a monitoring indicator , with the corresponding gray scale levels shown on the right .",
    "each base pair step is characterized by a column consisting of two sub - columns , with the left sub - columns referring to the sequence written at the top in 5-3 direction from left to right .",
    "the right sub - columns refer to the complementary sequence shown at the bottom .",
    "it is seen that , in a - tracts , the b@xmath3 conformation is preferably found in apa steps and that @xmath1 transitions in neighboring steps often occur concertedly so that along a single a - strand @xmath8 and @xmath9 conformations tend to alternate .",
    "the pattern of these transitions reveals rather slow dynamics and suggests that md trajectories in the 10 ns time scale are still not long enough to sample all relevant conformations .",
    "note , for instance , a very stable @xmath9 conformation in both strands at one of the gpg steps .",
    "plate ( c ) shows the time evolution of the overall shape of the helical axis .",
    "the optimal curved axes of all dna conformations saved during dynamics were rotated with the two ends fixed at the oz axis to put the middle point at the ox axis .",
    "the axis is next characterized by two perpendicular projections labeled x and y. any time section of the surfaces shown in the figure gives the corresponding axis projection averaged over a time window of 75 ps .",
    "the horizontal deviation is given in angstrms and , for clarity , its relative scale is two times increased with respect to the true dna length . shown on the right",
    "are two perpendicular views of the last one - nanosecond - average conformation .",
    "its orientation is chosen to correspond approximately that of the helical axis in the surface plots .",
    "it is seen that the molecule maintained a planar bent shape during a substantial part of the trajectory , and that at the end the bending plane was passing through the three a - tracts .",
    "the x - surface clearly shows an increase in bending during the second half of the trajectory . in the perpendicular y - projection the helical axis",
    "is locally wound , but straight on average .",
    "the fluctuating pattern in y - projection sometimes reveals two local maxima between a - tracts , which corresponds to two independent bends with slightly divergent directions .",
    "one may note also that there were at least two relatively long periods when the axis was almost straight , namely , around 3 ns and during the fifth nanosecond .",
    "at the same time , straightening of only one of the two bending points is a more frequent event observed several times in the surface plots .",
    "finally , plate ( d ) shows the time fluctuations of the bending direction and angle .",
    "the bending direction is characterized by the angle between the x - projection plane in plate ( c ) and the @xmath10 plane of the local dna coordinate frame constructed in the center of the duplex . according to the cambridge convention @xcite the local @xmath11 direction points to the major dna groove along the short axis of the base - pair , while the local @xmath12 axis direction is adjacent to the optimal helicoidal axis .",
    "thus , a zero angle between the two planes corresponds to the overall bend to the minor groove exactly at the central base pair . in both plots ,",
    "short time scale fluctuations are smoothed by averaging with a window of 15 ps . the total angle measured between the opposite axis",
    "ends fluctuates around 10 - 15@xmath13  in the least bent states and raises to average 40 - 50@xmath13  during periods of strong bending .",
    "the maximal instantaneous bend of 58@xmath13  was observed at around 8 ns .",
    "the bending direction was much more stable during the last few nanoseconds , however , it fluctuated at a roughly constant value of 50@xmath13starting from the second nanosecond .",
    "this value means that the center of the observed planar bend is shifted by approximately two steps from the middle base pair so that its preferred direction is to the minor groove at the two att triplets , which is well distinguished in plate ( c ) as well , and corresponds to the local minima in the minor groove profiles in plate ( a ) . during the periods when the molecule straightened the bending direction strongly fluctuates .",
    "this effect is due to the fact that when the axis becomes straight the bending plane is not defined , which in our case appears when the central point of the curved axis passes close to the line between its ends .",
    "it is very interesting , however , that after the straightening , the bending is resumed in approximately the same direction .",
    "figure [ ftj2 ] exhibits similar data for another 10 ns trajectory of the same dna fragment , computed in order to check reproducibility of the results .",
    "a straight dna conformation was taken from the initial phase of the previous trajectory , energy minimized , and restarted with random initial velocities .",
    "it shows surprisingly similar results as regards the bending direction and dynamics in spite of a somewhat different minor groove profile and significantly different distribution of @xmath8 and @xmath9 conformers along the backbone .",
    "note that in this case the helical axis was initially s - shaped in x - projection , with one of the a - tracts exhibiting a completely opposite bending direction .",
    "fluctuations of the bending direction are reduced and are similar to the final part of the first trajectory , which apparently results from the additional re - equilibration . in this case the maximal instantaneous bend of 71@xmath13  was observed at around 4 ns .",
    "comparison of traces in plates ( a ) and ( d ) in figs .",
    "[ ftj1 ] and [ ftj2 ] clearly shows that large scale slow fluctuations of rmsd are caused by bending .",
    "the rmsd drops down to 2   when the duplex is straight and raises beyond 6   in strongly bent conformations . in both trajectories",
    "the molecule experienced many temporary transitions to straight conformations which usually are very short living .",
    "these observations suggest that the bent state is relatively more stable than the straight one and , therefore , the observed behavior corresponds to static curvature . in conformations averaged over successive one nanosecond",
    "intervals the overall bending angle is 35 - 45@xmath13  except for a few periods in the first trajectory .",
    "figure [ fsnap ] shows a snapshot from around 8.5 ns of the second trajectory where the rmsd from the straight canonical b - dna reached its maximum of 6.5  .",
    "the strong smooth bent towards the minor grooves of the three a - tracts is evident , with the overall bending angle around 61@xmath13 .",
    "all transformations exhibited in figs .",
    "[ ftj1 ] and [ ftj2 ] are isoenergetic , with the total energy fluctuating around the same level established during the first nanosecond already , and the same is true for the average helicoidal parameters",
    ". plates ( b ) , however , indicate that there are much slower motions in the system , and this observation precludes any conclusions concerning the global stability of the observed conformations .",
    "moreover , we have computed yet another trajectory for the same molecule starting from the canonical a - dna form . during 10 ns it converged to a similarly good b - dna structure with the same average total energy , but",
    "the bending pattern was not reproduced .",
    "it appears , therefore , that the conformational space is divided into distinct domains , with transitions between them probably occurring in much longer time scales .",
    "however , the very fact that the stable curvature in good agreement with experimental data emerges in trajectories starting from a featureless straight canonical b - dna conformation strongly suggests that the true molecular mechanism of the a - tract induced bending is reproduced .",
    "therefore , it can not depend upon the components discarded in our calculations , notably , specific interactions with solvent counterions and long - range electrostatic effects .",
    "we are not yet ready to present a detailed molecular mechanism responsible for the observed curvature because even in this relatively small system it is difficult to distinguish the cause and the consequences .",
    "we believe , however , that all sorts of bending of the double helical dna , including that produced by ligands and that due to intrinsic sequence effects , have its limited , but high flexibility as a common origin .",
    "its own conformational energy has the global minimum in a straight form , but this minimum is very broad and flat , and dna responds by distinguishable bending to even small perturbations . the results reported here prove that in the case of a - tracts these perturbations are produced by dna - water interactions in the minor groove .",
    "neither long range phosphate repulsion nor counterions are essential .",
    "the curvature is certainly connected with the specific a - tract structure and modulations of the minor groove width , but it does not seem to be strictly bound to them . in dynamics , conformations ,",
    "both smoothly bent and kinked at the two insertions between the a - tracts , are observed periodically .",
    "note also , that the minor groove profile somewhat differs between the two trajectories and that it does not change when the molecule straightens .",
    "we strongly believe , however , the experimental data already available will finally allow one to solve this problem by theoretical means , including the approach described here , and we continue these attempts .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations have been performed with the internal coordinate method ( icmd ) @xcite including special technique for flexible sugar rings @xcite .",
    "the so - called `` minimal b - dna '' model was used @xcite which consists of a double helix with the minor groove filled with explicit water . unlike the more widely used models , it does not involve explicit counterions and damps long range electrostatic interactions in a semi - empirical way by using distance scaling of the electrostatic constant and reduction of phosphate charges .",
    "the dna model was same as in earlier reports , @xcite namely , all torsions were free as well as bond angles centered at sugar atoms , while other bonds and angles were fixed , and the bases held rigid .",
    "amber94 @xcite force field and atom parameters were used with tip3p water @xcite and no cut off schemes . with a time step of 10 fs , these simulation conditions require around 75 hours of cpu per nanosecond on a pentium ii-200 microprocessor .",
    "the initial conformations were prepared by vacuum energy minimization starting from the fiber b - dna model constructed from the published atom coordinates .",
    "@xcite the subsequent hydration protocol to fill up the minor groove @xcite normally adds around 16 water molecules per base pair .",
    "the heating and equilibration protocols were same as before @xcite . during the runs , after every 200 ps , water positions were checked in order to identify those penetrating into the major groove and those completely separated .",
    "these molecules , if found , were removed and next re - introduced in simulations by putting them with zero velocities at random positions around the hydrated duplex , so that they could readily re - join the core system .",
    "this procedure assures stable conditions , notably , a constant number of molecules in the minor groove hydration cloud and the absence of water in the major groove , which is necessary for fast sampling @xcite .",
    "the interval of 200 ps between the checks is small enough to assure that on average less then one molecule is repositioned and , therefore , the perturbation introduced is considered negligible .",
    "i thank r. lavery for useful discussions as well as critical comments and suggestions to the paper .",
