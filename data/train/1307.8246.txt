    "a well - known result due to bessaga and klee ( see , for example , ( * ? ? ? * section iii.6 ) ) provides a classification of pairs @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a hausdorff topological vector space and @xmath2 a closed convex body , up to a homeomorphism .",
    "let us recall this result .",
    "let @xmath1 be a hausdorff topological vector space and @xmath2 a closed convex body ( i.e. , a closed convex set with nonempty interior ) .",
    "characteristic cone _ of @xmath3 ( denoted by @xmath4 ) is the set of those @xmath5 such that the half - line @xmath6 is contained in @xmath3 for some @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath8 , then @xmath4 is exactly the zero set of the minkowski functional of @xmath3 ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section iii.1 ) )",
    ".    then the classification is summed up in the following theorem :    [ t : bk ] let @xmath1 be a hausdorff topological vector space and @xmath2 a closed convex body .",
    "* if @xmath4 is a linear subspace of finite codimension @xmath9 , then the pair @xmath0 is homeomorphic to the pair @xmath10^m)$ ] . *",
    "if @xmath4 is a linear subspace of infinite codimension , then the pair @xmath0 is homeomorphic to the pair @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a closed half - space of @xmath1 . *",
    "if @xmath4 is not a linear subspace , then the pair @xmath0 is homeomorphic also to the pair @xmath11 .",
    "we have studied this result at a seminar with students using the book @xcite and we encountered a difficulty with proving the assertion ( iii ) .",
    "on page 112 of that book a formula is given , illustrated by a picture and followed by the claim that ` it is not difficult to check ' that this gives the required homeomorphism .",
    "after certain effort we realized that this claim is not true ",
    "the given formula need not provide a homeomorphism .",
    "it is explained in section  [ s : bp ] below .    after finding the error we tried to correct it and to look at the literature for a correct proof .",
    "the original reference for the result is the paper @xcite .",
    "however , this paper does not contain explicit formulation of the theorem .",
    "the desired statement is a special case of the more general ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 1.3 ) . and",
    "again , in its proof a formula is described and followed by the claim that ` it is tedious but not difficult to verify ' that the formula gives the desired homeomorphism . in this case",
    "the claim is correct .",
    "in fact , the proof is not even too tedious . in section  [ s : bk ]",
    "we describe this method applied directly to the case of the above theorem .    before finding and analyzing the original paper we established a correction of the proof from @xcite .",
    "this correction is described in section  [ s : c1 ] .",
    "it is quite complicated , but we think it contains several interesting features . later , after analyzing the original method we got an idea that the error in @xcite is probably due to a misprint . and really , this yields the proof described in section  [ s : c2 ] .",
    "the proof is a bit more complicated than the original one .    finally , we found the paper @xcite where an analogous classification of @xmath13-smooth convex bodies in banach spaces up to a @xmath13-diffeomorphism is given .",
    "as a special case @xmath14 the homeomorphic classification is given .",
    "the proof of the case ( iii ) takes only half a page .",
    "it refers to the implicit function theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 10.2.5 ) . however , the key parts of the proof are missing ( for example the proof that the respective maps are bijections and the proof that the frchet differential at each point is an onto isomorphism ) .",
    "further , there is one small mistake in the definition of one of the important sets . in section  [ s : d ] below we give a proof using the method of @xcite for the homeomorphism case . under the additional smoothness assumptions the same proof provides the classification up to a diffeomorphism . further , our proof is more elementary , since it uses only a simple version of the implicit function theorem ( see theorem  [ ift ] below ) .    in view of this situation",
    "we decided to write down several variants of the proof because we think that such a result deserves it .",
    "let us fix some notation .",
    "we adopt the notation of @xcite , the notation in the other two works is different .    if @xmath3 is a convex set containing @xmath15 in its interior , we denote by @xmath16 the minkowsi functional of @xmath3 .",
    "further , @xmath17 is the set of those @xmath18 such that the line @xmath19 is contained in @xmath3 for some @xmath20 . in other words , @xmath21 .",
    "we will review below several possibilities of proving the assertion ( iii ) of theorem  [ t : bk ] .",
    "not surprisingly , all the proofs follow the same pattern .",
    "let us describe this general pattern .",
    "let @xmath2 be a closed convex body such that @xmath4 is not a linear subspace .",
    "it means that there is @xmath22 such that @xmath23 . without loss of generality",
    "we may suppose that @xmath24 .",
    "then @xmath25 , @xmath26y\\not\\subset u$ ] and there is some @xmath27 such that @xmath28y\\subset u$ ] .",
    "hence , without loss of generality we may suppose that @xmath29 .",
    "if we define a linear functional on @xmath30 by the formula @xmath31 , then @xmath32 for each @xmath33 .",
    "so , hahn - banach theorem implies that there is a linear functional @xmath34 on @xmath1 extending @xmath35 such that @xmath36 for each @xmath5 .",
    "set @xmath37 .",
    "then @xmath38 is a linear functional on @xmath1 such that @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath18 . in particular , @xmath41 on @xmath42 , so @xmath38 is continuous .",
    "set @xmath43 .",
    "now , a basic method of constructing a homeomorphism of the pair @xmath0 onto the pair @xmath44 is the following : to any @xmath45 assign some @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath47 be the last point at the segment @xmath48 $ ] contained in @xmath3 and let @xmath49 be a suitable point at the segment @xmath50 .",
    "next , we choose a self - homeomorphism @xmath51 of the halfline @xmath52 which is identity on the segment @xmath53 $ ] and the segment @xmath54 $ ] is mapped onto the segment @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "finally define the global homeomorphism @xmath56 by @xmath51 at the respective halfline and by the identity at the points not covered by such halflines .",
    "then a proof that @xmath56 is indeed a homeomorphism requires three steps :    * @xmath56 is well - defined ( i.e. , the respective halflines do not intersect ) .",
    "* @xmath56 is a self - homeomorphism of the union of the halflines .",
    "* @xmath56 remains homeomorphism if glued with the identity .",
    "the proofs appearing in the literature differ in the formula for @xmath57 , the choice of @xmath49 and the definition of @xmath51 .",
    "an important part of the proof ( namely of the second step ) consists in using the following easy lemma .",
    "[ l : mink ] let @xmath2 be a closed convex body .",
    "then the mapping @xmath58 is continuous on @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath60 be arbitrary .",
    "we will show that the sets @xmath61 are open .    if @xmath62 , then the first set is empty . for @xmath63",
    "the inequality @xmath64 is equivalent to @xmath65 , so @xmath66 .",
    "it follows that the first set is in this case open .",
    "the second set equals @xmath59 for @xmath67 . for @xmath68",
    "it equals @xmath69 .",
    "finally , for @xmath70 the inequality @xmath71 is equivalent to @xmath72 , i.e. , @xmath73 . in any case",
    "the second set is open as well .",
    "in this section we collect several variants of the proof .",
    "we start by the original proof which is hidden in @xcite , then we continue by explaining why the proof in @xcite is incorrect and suggest two possible corrections .      as we have remarked above , the paper @xcite in fact do not contain explicit formulation of the theorem .",
    "but the result follows from a more general lemma 1.3 .",
    "let us give the proof to see that it is really easy , if properly formulated .",
    "fix a closed convex body @xmath74 such that @xmath75 .",
    "for example , one can take @xmath76 or @xmath77",
    ". set @xmath78 .",
    "then @xmath79 is a closed convex body in @xmath80 and , moreover , @xmath81 .    for @xmath45 define @xmath82 and let @xmath49 be the last point of the segment @xmath48 $ ] contained in @xmath74 .",
    "the homeomorphism @xmath51 is defined as identity on the segment @xmath53 $ ] , on @xmath54 $ ] as the affine transformation sending this segment to @xmath55 $ ] and on the halfline @xmath83 as a translation .",
    "the proof that the glued mapping @xmath56 is a homeomorphism has three steps :    step 1 : the halflines @xmath52 , @xmath45 , are pairwise disjoint and their union is the set @xmath84 .",
    "let @xmath5 .",
    "let us find out under which conditions there is @xmath45 such that @xmath85 i.e. , there are @xmath45 and @xmath86 such that @xmath87 this equation is equivalent to @xmath88 applying the functional @xmath38 to both sides of this equation we get @xmath89 more precisely , applying @xmath38 to we get the second equation and plugging it into we get the first equation . if we plug @xmath90 to the second equation , we get the quadratic equation @xmath91 if @xmath92 , then this equation has one positive root and one negative root .",
    "denote the positive root by @xmath93 . if @xmath94 and @xmath95 , then the equation has one root equal to zero and the other one @xmath96 . if @xmath94 and @xmath97 , the equation has no positive root .    since the conditions @xmath94 and @xmath97 hold if and",
    "only if @xmath98 we get that the @xmath99 in is always unique and it follows from the first equation in that the corresponding @xmath100 is also unique .",
    "we denote it by @xmath101 .",
    "this finishes the proof of step 1 .",
    "moreover , the above calculation shows that the mappings @xmath102 and @xmath103 are continuous on @xmath104 .",
    "@xmath56 is a homeomorphism of @xmath104 onto itself .",
    "it is clear that @xmath56 is a bijection of @xmath104 onto itself .",
    "so , it is enough to show that @xmath56 and @xmath105 are continuous on @xmath104 .",
    "this can be done using lemma  [ l : mink ] and continuity of @xmath101 and @xmath93 .",
    "more precisely , let us define @xmath106 , a function of four real variables , on the set @xmath107 by the formula @xmath108 this function is continuous on its domain , since all the three formulas are continuous , their domains are relatively closed and the formulas agree on the intersections of their domains .",
    "further , @xmath109 so both @xmath56 and @xmath105 are continuous .",
    "@xmath56 is a homeomorphism of @xmath1 onto itself .    since @xmath110 and @xmath56 is the identity on @xmath111 , the global continuity of @xmath56 and @xmath105 follows .",
    "lemma 1.3 in @xcite we have mentioned above is more general .",
    "it deals with homeomorphisms of triples , not pairs . to",
    "the set @xmath74 from @xcite corresponds our set @xmath3 , the sets @xmath3 and @xmath112 from @xcite in our case coincide both with @xmath74 . the `",
    "tedious but not difficult ' part skipped in @xcite corresponds to our steps 1 and 2 .",
    "it is clear that the computation is not difficult , but especially step 1 probably can not be seen without a computation .",
    "on page 112 of the quoted book the authors suggest the formulas @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "further , @xmath51 is defined as the identity on @xmath53 $ ] and on the halfline @xmath115 as an affine mapping fixing @xmath49 and taking @xmath47 to @xmath100 .",
    "we shall see that these formulas do not provide a homeomorphism .",
    "the problem is that if @xmath116 , we get @xmath117 .",
    "in such a case @xmath47 should be defined to be @xmath100 and already the mapping @xmath118 may fail to be continuous .",
    "let us describe a counterexample .",
    "set @xmath119 and @xmath120 then @xmath8 and one can choose @xmath121 and @xmath122    let @xmath123 .",
    "then @xmath124 , @xmath125 , hence @xmath126 , @xmath127 and hence @xmath128 .",
    "further , for any @xmath129 let @xmath130 . then @xmath131 , @xmath132 , hence @xmath133 .",
    "further , @xmath134 as this point belongs is the intersection of the boundary of @xmath3 with the segment @xmath135 $ ] .",
    "hence @xmath136 and @xmath137 .    since @xmath138 and @xmath139 , @xmath56 is not continuous .      in this section",
    "we present a possible correction of the proof from @xcite .",
    "we change the formula for @xmath57 with preserving the remaining assumptions .",
    "let us set @xmath140 .",
    "in this case the equality @xmath117 remains possible , but the square root changes certain order of convergence and makes the respective mappings continuous .",
    "this version of the proof is the most complicated one but we find it interesting .",
    "so , let us give a proof .",
    "set @xmath141 .",
    "then the halflines @xmath52 , @xmath142 , are disjoint and cover the set @xmath143 .",
    ". we will find out under which conditions there is @xmath142 and @xmath86 such that @xmath144 this equation is equivalent to @xmath145 so , by applying @xmath38 to both sides we get ( similarly as in `` @xmath146 '' above ) @xmath147 from the first equation it follows that @xmath148 if we want @xmath142 .",
    "further , if we isolate @xmath149 from the first equation and plug the result into the second one , we get @xmath150 this is a quadratic equation for @xmath151 with a unique positive root @xmath152 . hence , by the first equation in , there is a unique @xmath153 .",
    "this completes the proof of step 1 .",
    "moreover , the computation shows that the mappings @xmath103 and @xmath102 are continuous on @xmath143 .",
    "@xmath56 is a homeomorphism of @xmath143 onto itself .",
    "it is clear that @xmath56 is a bijection of the respective set onto itself .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath56 and @xmath105 are continuous .",
    "let us define two functions of two real variables on the set @xmath154 by the formulas @xmath155 these functions are clearly continuous ( the individual formulas are continuous , coincide on the intersection of the domains and the domains are relatively closed ) .",
    "further , for @xmath156 we have @xmath157 it follows from lemma  [ l : mink ] using the continuity of mappings @xmath158 , @xmath102 and @xmath159 and the fact that @xmath160 in this case that @xmath56 and @xmath105 are continuous .",
    "step 3 : @xmath56 is a homeomorphism of @xmath1 onto itself .    on the set @xmath161 the mapping @xmath56 is defined to be identity . since this set is closed , it is enough to show that whenever @xmath162 is a net in @xmath163 such that @xmath164 with @xmath165 , then @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "so , let @xmath168 be such a net .",
    "let us decompose the index set into two parts : @xmath169 for @xmath170 we have @xmath171 , so it remains to show that the limit along @xmath172 is also @xmath173 , provided @xmath172 is cofinal . without loss of generality",
    "we may assume that @xmath174 , i.e. @xmath175    let us further compute the limit of @xmath176 .",
    "we have @xmath177 since @xmath178 we get @xmath179 .",
    "if @xmath180 , then @xmath181 , hence by lemma  [ l : mink ] we get @xmath182 and hence @xmath183 for large @xmath184 .",
    "it means that for large @xmath184 we have @xmath170 , a contradiction .",
    ". then @xmath186 . we will show that @xmath187 suppose it is not the case .",
    "since @xmath188 for each @xmath142 , up to passing to a subnet we may assume that there is some @xmath189 such that @xmath190 it means that @xmath191 , hence @xmath192",
    "so , @xmath193 since @xmath194 the sum of the first two terms is for @xmath184 large enough a convex combination of @xmath195 and @xmath196 , hence it belongs to @xmath3 .",
    "further , the coefficient at the last term is positive for @xmath184 large enough ( this is the place where the choice of the square root is essential ) which yields a contradiction as @xmath197 .",
    "thus indeed @xmath198 .",
    "now we are ready to conclude . to shorten the notation , set @xmath199 and @xmath200 , since @xmath201 , we have    @xmath202 since @xmath164 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "similarly , @xmath206    this completes the proof .",
    "another possibility how to correct the proof is to use the formula @xmath207 for @xmath45 . in this case",
    "the problem appearing in the original version and in the first correction disappears , since @xmath208 for all @xmath45 .",
    "let us show that this modification works .",
    "the halflines @xmath52 , @xmath45 , are pairwise disjoint and their union is the set @xmath209 .",
    "let @xmath5 .",
    "let us find out under which conditions there are @xmath45 and @xmath86 such that @xmath210 this equation is equivalent to @xmath211 by applying @xmath38 to both sides we see that the above equation is equivalent to ( similarly as in `` @xmath146 '' above ) @xmath212 from the first equation isolate @xmath149 and plug it to the second equation .",
    "we get thus a quadratic equation for @xmath99 : @xmath213 if @xmath148 , there is a unique positive root @xmath152 . if @xmath165 and @xmath214 , there is a unique positive root @xmath215 .",
    "if @xmath165 and @xmath216 ( i.e. , if @xmath217 ) , then there is no positive root .",
    "this shows there is a unique @xmath152 and it follows from the first equation in that there is also a unique @xmath153 .",
    "this completes the proof of step 1 .",
    "moreover , the computation shows that the mappings @xmath103 and @xmath102 are continuous on @xmath209 .",
    "@xmath56 is a homeomorphism of @xmath209 onto itself .",
    "it is clear that @xmath56 is a bijection of the mentioned set onto itself .",
    "further , the formulas for @xmath56 and @xmath105 are the same as in the previous case . of course ,",
    "@xmath101 , @xmath93 and @xmath218 are given by different formulas , but since these mappings are continuous , we get that @xmath56 and @xmath105 are continuous .",
    "@xmath56 is a homeomorphism of @xmath1 onto itself .",
    "since @xmath56 is defined as the identity on the set @xmath219 and this set is closed in @xmath1 , it is enough to show the following : let @xmath168 be a net in @xmath209 converging to some @xmath220",
    ". then @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "so , let us have such a net .",
    "we have @xmath221 .",
    "we will show that for @xmath184 large enough @xmath222 .",
    "then the proof will be completed as it will follow that for @xmath184 large enough @xmath171 .",
    "the desired inequality is equivalent to @xmath223 , i.e. @xmath224 , equivalently @xmath225    let us analyze the limit behaviour of the left - hand side .",
    "set @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "then @xmath228 and @xmath229 , hence @xmath230",
    ". we have @xmath231 if @xmath232 , then @xmath233 .",
    "moreover , @xmath234 , hence @xmath235 , so necessarily @xmath236 .",
    "it follows that @xmath237 .    if @xmath238 , then @xmath239 is the positive root of the quadratic equation from step 1 , so @xmath240 it follows that @xmath241 , hence @xmath242 since @xmath243 , @xmath197 and @xmath244 , we get @xmath245 .",
    "hence @xmath246 for @xmath184 large enough and the proof is completed .",
    "it took us some time to discover that the proof in @xcite is incorrect .",
    "as remarked above , the error is already in the second step , since the assignment @xmath118 fails to be continuous .",
    "the correction from section  [ s : c1 ] is quite complicated but we find it interesting since it uses some balance of asymptotic behaviour .",
    "the correction from section  [ s : c2 ] is much simpler and now , a posteriori , we are convinced that this is the formula the authors had in mind .",
    "but it is still more complicated than the original proof , the main difference is in step 3 . while in the original version step 3 is trivial , in the method described in section  [ s : c2 ] step 3 requires some nontrivial computation .",
    "at least we do not see how to prove it without any computation like in the original version .",
    "the approach of @xcite is a bit different , it focuses on smooth bodies in banach spaces and refers to the implicit function theorem . as remarked above",
    ", the proof is extremely consise and missing computations ( checking the assumptions of the implicit function theorem ) is nontrivial  it would be much longer than the proof itself . in this section",
    "we give a modification of the proof from @xcite which works simultaneously in the topological and the smooth cases .",
    "our version is moreover simplified and more elementary .",
    "in particular , it uses a simpler version of the implicit function theorem ( not only its proof is simpler , but the assumptions are easier to check ) and the form of our formula is simpler ( although the mapping is the same ) since we use minkowski functional related to only one convex body",
    ". we will give the proof in the topological case and then comment why it works also in the smooth case .",
    "the existence of @xmath248 is a well - known fact .",
    "the existence of @xmath249 is not obvious and in @xcite it is just postulated .",
    "one can take , for example , @xmath259 for @xmath260 , where @xmath261 is a small enough number and complete this function by zero on the rest of @xmath250 .",
    "then there is @xmath269 , a neighborhood of @xmath270 in @xmath1 , and @xmath56 , a neighborhood of @xmath271 in @xmath250 and a continuous function @xmath272 such that @xmath273 and for @xmath274 one has @xmath275 if and only if @xmath276 .",
    "this theorem follows from a more general ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter iii , section 8 , theorem 25 ) ( which deals with a normed space in place of @xmath250 ) .",
    "however , our version is much simpler and can be proved by the same way as the easiest version for @xmath277 functions from @xmath278 to @xmath250 .",
    "note that in @xcite there is a small error , where instead of @xmath283 the author writes @xmath284 .",
    "we proceed in the same way as above .",
    "fix @xmath5 and try to find @xmath86 and @xmath45 such that @xmath285 .",
    "this equation is equivalent to @xmath286 hence by applying @xmath38 to both sides we get ( similarly as in `` @xmath146 '' above ) @xmath287 if we isolate @xmath149 from the first equation and plug it in the second one , we get @xmath288 denote the left - hand side by @xmath289 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath106 is defined and continuous on @xmath290 and , moreover , @xmath291 which is also continuous on @xmath290 .",
    "further , @xmath292 for @xmath293 . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath165 , then @xmath294 . if @xmath148 and @xmath295 , then @xmath296 . finally , if @xmath148 and @xmath297 , then by the properties of @xmath249 we get @xmath298        case 2 : @xmath148 . then @xmath303 ( as @xmath249 has at @xmath304 the limit @xmath304 ) and @xmath305 ( as @xmath249 vanishes at a neighborhood of zero )",
    "further , since @xmath306 is continuous and strictly decreasing on @xmath307 , there is a unique root .",
    "it follows that @xmath299 is one - to - one and its range is @xmath282 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath299 is continuous . by theorem  [ ift ]",
    "we get that the second coordinate of the inverse is continuous , the continuity of the first coordinate then follows , hence @xmath308 is continuous .      since @xmath188 whenever @xmath45 , @xmath309 maps @xmath281 into itself .",
    "@xmath309 is clearly continuous . to show that @xmath309 is a bijection and",
    "the inverse is continuous , let us investigate the first coordinate , i.e. , the mapping @xmath311 we have @xmath312 this partial derivative is continuous and strictly positive on @xmath281 .",
    "moreover , for any @xmath45 we have @xmath313 hence @xmath309 is a bijection .",
    "moreover , the continuity of @xmath314 follows from theorem  [ ift ] .",
    "this completes the proof of step 2 .",
    "the mapping @xmath315 is a homeomorphism of @xmath282 onto itself .",
    "moreover , it maps each halfline @xmath316 onto itself in an increasing manner such that the segment @xmath317 $ ] is mapped onto @xmath318 $ ] .",
    "indeed , @xmath56 is a homeomorphism as a composition of homeomorphisms .",
    "further , from the construction it is clear that it preserves the mentioned halflines in an increasing manner .",
    "the last thing to show is that @xmath319 . to show this notice first that @xmath320 , hence @xmath321 , thus @xmath319 .",
    "since @xmath322 is closed , it is enough to check that @xmath56 and @xmath105 are continuous at points of this set .",
    "so , let us fix @xmath173 in this set and a net @xmath162 in the complement converging to @xmath173 .",
    "let @xmath323 .",
    "let us first show that @xmath324 .",
    "suppose not .",
    "then , up to passing to a subnet , we may assume that @xmath325 $ ] .",
    "we have @xmath326 if @xmath327 , then the limit on the right - hand side is @xmath328 ( since @xmath249 is zero on a neighborhood of zero ) , which is not possible .",
    "if @xmath329 , then the right - hand side goes to @xmath330 ( since @xmath331 ) .",
    "thus @xmath95 , a contradiction .",
    "so , we have proved that @xmath324 .",
    "further , @xmath332 hence @xmath333 by lemma  [ l : mink ] .",
    "but the latter value is zero , since @xmath334 and @xmath197 , so for each @xmath258 we have @xmath335 .",
    "so , for @xmath184 large enough we have @xmath336 hence @xmath337 .",
    "finally , for those @xmath184 we have @xmath171 .      in case @xmath1",
    "is a banach space a @xmath3 is a @xmath13-smooth convex body ( where @xmath338 ) , the homeomorphism @xmath56 constructed above is a @xmath13-diffeomorphism . indeed , first remark that , if in theorem  [ ift ] we moreover assume that @xmath1 is a banach space and @xmath106 is @xmath13-smooth , then @xmath339 is also @xmath13-smooth .",
    "further , in this case the function from lemma  [ l : mink ] is @xmath13-smooth on the complement of its zero set by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 1 ) .",
    "( the proof of this lemma is omitted in @xcite , but it is an easy consequence of the definition . )",
    "further , the function @xmath106 used in step 1 is @xmath13-smooth on @xmath290 ( at points where @xmath340 this is a composition of @xmath13-functions mentioned above ; if @xmath341 , then @xmath300 on a neighborhood of @xmath342 ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath299 is a @xmath13-diffeomorphism .",
    "similarly we can see that the mapping @xmath309 from step 2 is a @xmath13-diffeomorphism .",
