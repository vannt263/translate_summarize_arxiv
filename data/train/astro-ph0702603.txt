    "one of the most surprising findings of the studies of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) made with the _ swift gamma - ray burst explorer _",
    "@xcite is that nearly half of all bursts show flares , or large short - lived increases in emission at times after the initial prompt emission has died away @xcite .",
    "these flares are superimposed on either the rapidly decaying tail of the prompt emission , or the very slowly decaying phase of the early afterglow , and can involve flux increases of as much as three orders of magnitude .",
    "some bursts have single flares , although most bursts with flares have multiple flaring episodes .",
    "most flares are at early times , @xmath3s , although strong flares can occur as late as @xmath4s after the onset of the burst .",
    "the origin of grb flares is still an open question .",
    "evidence is mounting , however , that the origin of these flares is similar to that of the prompt grb emission ( i.e. either internal shocks or some other well localized dissipation process within the ultra - relativistic outflow ) , rather than to that of the afterglow emission ( i.e. the external shock going into the ambient medium ) .",
    "this evidence includes the multiplicity of flares ; their sharp time structure : rapid rise and decay and sub - peak structure within the flares ; the large increase in flux during the flare ; and the hard to soft spectral evolution of the flares , which is similar to the spectral evolution found in the prompt emission .    in the context of the internal shocks model @xcite ,",
    "flares may be caused by late - time collisions of shells of relativistic material that are produced by the central engine with varying lorentz factors .",
    "these can occur either by late time sporadic activity of the central source , or by a small relative velocity between shells that were ejected during the prompt grb emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "very few grbs have a sequence of multiple flares bright enough to be studied in detail .",
    "grb  060714 @xcite showed a series of five flares starting at @xmath5s after the start of the burst .",
    "the first three flares were clearly detected by the _",
    "burst alert telescope ( bat ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the last three were seen as strong flares by the _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and as weak flares by the bat .",
    "the first two flares occurred while the spacecraft was slewing to or settling at the burst location , so they were not observable by the xrt .",
    "this burst provides a rare opportunity to study a rapid sequence of flares across a large energy range .",
    "the five flares show evidence of hard to soft spectral evolution as the flares progress and also strong similarities , in particular sharply resolved temporal features and large flux increases in each flare .",
    "we show that these results are inconsistent with an external shock ( i.e. afterglow ) origin for the flares , and suggest instead a late - time and lower energy continuation of the prompt emission , either due to late time intermittent activity of the central source or via well localized spasmodic dissipation events within the outflow .",
    "in fact these results suggest that it may no longer be possible to draw a clear distinction between what have traditionally been called the prompt emission and the x - ray flares",
    ". historically the prompt emission was that detected above @xmath6  kev , and generally considered to be due to activity of the central engine .",
    "x - ray flares are usually detected most strongly at lower energies , so they were considered a completely separate phenomenon . since we show here that ( a ) the flares of grb  060714 are very likely of common origin to the earliest emission from the burst , ( b ) the flares are detected above 20  kev , and ( c ) the flares show a gradual and continual evolution linking them to the prompt emission , it is quite reasonable to consider the flares a lower energy continuation of the same phenomenon as the prompt emission .",
    "however to be consistent with earlier work we do use the term  prompt emission \" to refer to the emission in the first peak , @xmath7  s from the burst trigger ( see   [ bat ] ) ,  flare \" to refer to the peaks more than @xmath5  s after the trigger , and `` afterglow '' to refer to the smooth decay @xmath8  s from the trigger .    in this paper",
    "we describe the prompt , flaring and afterglow properties of grb  060714 , with particular emphasis on the flares . in   [ sec2 ] we discuss the observations and data analysis in general , while",
    "  [ flares ] focuses on the analysis of the spectral and temporal properties of the flares .",
    "finally , in   [ sec4 ] we show that the properties of the flares rule out an external shock ( or long lived reverse shock ) origin , and provide some ( though not unequivocal ) support for an origin common to that of the prompt emission . in  4.3 and appendix a",
    "we exclude internal shocks with a small contrast in the lorentz factor as the origin of the flares in grb  060714 , and point out that this mechanism faces serious problems for most swift grbs .    throughout the paper",
    "we have followed the convention @xmath9 , where the energy spectral index @xmath10  is related to the photon index @xmath11 .",
    "we have adopted the standard values of the cosmological parameters : @xmath12 , @xmath13  = 0.27 , and @xmath14  = 0.73 .",
    "the phenomenology of the burst is presented in the observer frame unless otherwise stated .",
    "at 15:12:00 ut , 14 july 2006 , the _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ) triggered and located on - board grb  060714 ( bat trigger=219101 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "unless otherwise specified , times @xmath15 in this paper are measured from the bat trigger time , ( ut 15:12:00.3 ) hereafter designated t@xmath16 .",
    "the burst was detected in the part of the bat field of view that was 27% coded , meaning that it was 33.6@xmath17 off - axis and only 27% of the bat detectors were illuminated by the source .",
    "the spacecraft began to slew to the source location at t@xmath18s and was settled at the source location at t@xmath19s .",
    "the bat data for grb 060714 between t@xmath20s and t@xmath21s were collected in event mode with 100 @xmath22s time resolution and @xmath236  kev energy resolution @xcite .",
    "the data were processed using standard _",
    "swift_-bat analysis tools and the spectra were fit using xspec 11.3 .",
    "each bat event was mask - tagged using batmaskwtevt with the best fit source position .",
    "mask - tagging is a technique in which each event is weighted by a factor representing the fractional exposure to the source through the bat coded aperture .",
    "a weight of + 1 corresponds to a fully open detector and a weight of -1 to a fully blocked detector .",
    "flux from the background and other sources averages to zero with this method .",
    "all of the bat grb light curves shown in figures  [ fig1 ] , [ fig4 ] , and [ fig5 ] have been background subtracted by this method .",
    "this method is effective even when the spacecraft is moving since complete aspect information is available during the maneuver .",
    "the mask - weighting is also applied to produce weighted , background subtracted counts spectra using the tool batbinevt .",
    "since the response matrix depends on the position of the source in the bat field of view , separate matrices are derived for before the slew , after the slew and for individual segments of the light curve during the slew .",
    "the mask - weighted lightcurves seen in figure  [ fig1 ] show an initial triangular - shaped ( rising and falling power laws ) peak starting at t@xmath24s , peaking at t@xmath16 , and ending at t@xmath25s . given the size of the statistical error bars in the time before the slew , none of the fluctuations seen in figure  [ fig1 ] before the slew are statistically significant . the initial prompt emission",
    "was followed by two strong flares , the first starting at t@xmath26s with a duration of @xmath27s , and the second starting at t@xmath28s with a duration of @xmath29s .",
    "finally there was a much weaker third flare , starting at t@xmath30s with a duration of @xmath31s .",
    "taking into account the prompt emission plus the flares , we derive @xmath32s ( estimated error including systematics ) .",
    "the time - averaged spectrum from @xmath33s to @xmath34s is best fit by a simple power - law model .",
    "the power law photon index of the time - averaged spectrum is @xmath35 ( @xmath36 for 59 d.o.f . ) .",
    "the fluence in the 15 - 150 kev band is @xmath37 erg @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath39s peak photon flux measured from t@xmath16 + 75.42 s ( during the first flare ) in the 15 - 150 kev band is @xmath40 ph @xmath38 s@xmath41 .",
    "the prompt component does show spectral evolution , as evidenced by the increasing power law index : ( @xmath42 to @xmath43s ) : @xmath44 ; ( @xmath45 to @xmath46s ) : @xmath47 ; ( @xmath34 to @xmath48s ) : @xmath49 .",
    "all the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level .",
    "we attempted to fit a model consisting of a power law with an exponential cut - off to the prompt emission .",
    "such a fit did not constrain @xmath50 , the peak of the @xmath51  spectrum .",
    "however , it may be possible to use the results of @xcite to estimate @xmath50  for the prompt emission . @xcite have shown that due to the relatively narrow energy band of bat , it is often difficult to constrain @xmath50 , even when @xmath50 is within the bat energy range .",
    "these authors have found that the power - law photon index @xmath52  of a simple power law fit and @xmath50  are well correlated with a relationship : @xmath53[eqa ] under the assumption that @xmath50 is within the bat energy range . @xcite",
    "have reached a similar conclusion and consistent result by combining simulations and a study of bursts for which @xmath50 has been determined .",
    "we can use equation  1 and the measured @xmath54 , to find that @xmath55  kev .",
    "this value of @xmath50  is consistent with the majority of long grbs detected by bat .",
    "however , another possibility is that @xmath50  is above the bat energy range ( @xmath56  kev ) , and @xmath57 is instead simply the low energy power law index @xmath58 . according to the study of @xcite , a value of @xmath59is within the range of @xmath58  values found for batse bursts , although only 22 of the 350 bursts in the batse sample ( 6.3% ) have @xmath60 .",
    "since we can not exclude this second possibility , we will be conservative and quote only a lower limit , @xmath61  kev ( taking the lower limit on @xmath50  as derived from equation  1 ) . as discussed in ",
    "[ flares ] , @xmath50 is well constrained for the later flares .",
    "the spacecraft slewed immediately to the bat location of grb 060714 and the _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) began observing the burst at 15:13:39 ut ( @xmath62  s ) , first in image mode and then photodiode ( pd ) mode . the image mode contains no spectral or timing information and the pd mode data is severely corrupted by the presence of two hot columns .",
    "thus the first usable data is in windowed timing ( wt ) mode beginning at @xmath63  s ( see @xcite for a description of xrt readout modes ) .",
    "starting from @xmath64249  s all observations were carried out in photon counting ( pc ) mode .",
    "the xrt data were processed with the xrtdas software ( v.  1.7.1 ) developed at the asi science data center and included in the heasoft package ( v.  6.0.4 ) .",
    "event files were calibrated and cleaned with standard filtering criteria with the xrtpipeline task using the latest calibration files available in the _ swift _ caldb distributed by heasarc .",
    "event lists were selected in the 0.310.0  kev energy band and grades 012 for pc mode data and grades 02 for wt data were used in the analysis ( see @xcite for a definition of xrt event grades ) .",
    "the xrt pc image of the field clearly showed a bright fading x - ray object in the field @xcite .",
    "the coordinates of the burst were determined by the xrt to be ( j2000 ) : ra:@xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , dec : @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) with a 90% confidence error circle radius of @xmath69arcsec .",
    "events for temporal and spectral analysis of wt mode data were selected using a 40-pixel wide rectangular region centered on the afterglow .",
    "background events were extracted from a nearby source - free rectangular region of 40 pixel width .",
    "data in pc mode during the first _ swift _ orbit ( from @xmath70  s to @xmath71  s ) were significantly affected by pile - up . by comparing the observed point spread function ( psf ) profile with the analytical model @xcite , we removed pile - up effects by excluding events within a 2 pixel radius circle centered on the afterglow position and using an outer radius of 20 pixels . from the second orbit ,",
    "the afterglow count rate was below the xrt pile - up limit and events were extracted using a 10-pixel radius circle .",
    "the background for pc mode was estimated from a nearby source - free circular region of 50-pixel radius .",
    "source count rates for temporal analysis were corrected for the fraction of psf falling outside the event extraction regions and for pixels partially exposed .",
    "ancillary response files for the spectral analysis were generated with the xrtmkarf task applying corrections for the psf losses and pixel exposures .",
    "the latest response matrices ( v.  008 ) available in the _ swift _ caldb were used and source spectra were binned to ensure a minimum of 20 counts per bin .    as discussed in detail in ",
    "[ sec3 ] , the xrt light curve @xcite shown in figures  [ fig4 ] , [ fig2 ] , and [ fig5 ] displays three flares during the first orbit peaking at about @xmath1  + 115 , 140 and 180 s after the bat trigger . there is a steep decay after the end of the third xrt flare , with temporal power - law index @xmath72 , followed by a much shallower decay starting at @xmath73  s , which is probably the afterglow emission . the afterglow decay from t@xmath74s to t@xmath75ms",

    "a power - law fit to the 0.310 kev spectrum from t@xmath79s to t@xmath80s ( wt mode ) gives a photon index of @xmath81 and a column density of @xmath82 .",
    "the galactic hydrogen column density in the direction of the burst is @xmath83 .",
    "an extrapolation backward in time of the flat afterglow component ( @xmath84  segment in figure  [ fig2 ] ) tells us that the contribution of the underlying afterglow during this period is negligible and can safely be ignored in the spectral analysis .",
    "we also fit an absorbed single power - law model to the xrt 0.310 kev spectrum in pc mode ( from t@xmath85s to t@xmath86 ) . here",
    "we found a photon index of @xmath87 and a column density of @xmath88 . at later times , from t@xmath89s to t@xmath90s , the x  ray spectrum was well described by a single power - law model with photon index @xmath91 and an absorbing column density of @xmath92 .",
    "the _ swift _ ultra violet / optical telescope ( uvot ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) began observing the field of grb 060714 at @xmath93  s in the settling mode and obtained the first detection in the white filter ( 160 - 650 nm ) in the exposure starting at @xmath94  s @xcite .",
    "the position of the afterglow measured in the image from the initial exposure with the white filter is ra:@xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) , dec : @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) ( j2000 ) .",
    "the uncertainty of this position is likely to be dominated by systematic errors , which we estimate to be @xmath99  ( 90% confidence radius ) based on residuals when matching uvot sources in the image to stars in the usno - b1.0 catalog @xcite .",
    "uvot used the standard sequence of exposures for observing gamma - ray bursts .",
    "the sequence cycles through all seven lenticular filters with increasing exposure times as the time from the trigger increases .",
    "the afterglow was strongly detected in the white and v filters and weakly detected in the b filter .",

    "the count rates in the white filter were converted to equivalent v magnitudes using the ratio of the average count rates in white and v seen in the multiple exposures between @xmath1 + 700 s. and @xmath1 + 1582 s. upper limits ( @xmath100 ) in the u and w1 bands ( omitted for clarity from figure  [ fig3 ] ) are u @xmath101  ( 667  s @xmath102 835  s ) , and w1 @xmath103  ( 643  s @xmath104 811  s ) .",
    "this lack of detection is consistent with the reported burst redshift of @xmath105  ( * ? ?",
    "* see   [ other ] ) which shifts the lyman edge to 338 nm , cutting out much of the u and all of the w1 band .",
    "the lyman forest is also likely to reduce the flux in the u and b filters .    during the time period",
    "in which the x - ray light curve is showing flares followed by a steep decline , the optical light curve in the v band is essentially flat and at the same level as the afterglow .",
    "this tells us that the flaring activity does not manifest itself in the optical and suggests that the afterglow component dominates the optical light curve even at early times .",
    "this is consistent with what has been seen for other bursts with intense early flaring activity ( for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and for the unusual  late plateau \" of grb  070110 @xcite .",
    "at least during the time for which we have optical data , this burst seems to behave in a similar way to grb  050401 @xcite in which the optical and x - ray emission vary independently , but the prompt optical emission is consistent with a backward extrapolation of the later afterglow emission .",
    "grb 060714 was well observed by a large number of other telescopes with detections beginning at t@xmath106s @xcite and continuing until t@xmath107days @xcite .",
    "a @xmath100  upper limit of @xmath108  was obtained at t@xmath109days @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the reported optical detections compared to the x - ray data . during an observation beginning @xmath110hr after the burst , with the focal reducer and low dispersion spectrograph for the very large telescope of the european southern observatory ,",
    "[ @xcite acquired a spectrum showing numerous absorption features which correspond to a redshift of @xmath111  and a neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath112 . as seen in figure  [ fig3 ]",
    ", the r - band optical light curve can be well fit to a broken power - law decay with an index @xmath113  before t@xmath114s , and @xmath115 after .",
    "these values are very similar to the decay constants for the x - ray afterglow , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively .",
    "however the break in the x - ray light curve occurs at least @xmath118ks ( corresponding to a factor of @xmath119 in time ) earlier than the break in the r - band light curve .",
    "[ flares ]    there were a total of five flares detected in this burst as seen in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the first two were seen only in the bat : the first was during the slew and the second during times when the xrt was observing in imaging and photodiode mode and no detailed spectral or temporal information is available .",
    "the third one was significant in both bat and xrt and the fourth and fifth were seen as strong flares in the xrt , and weakly in the bat .    in the observer frame the flares lasted from @xmath120  s to @xmath121  s after the onset of burst emission ( at @xmath122  s ) .",
    "given the burst redshift of @xmath105  ( a quite typical value for _ swift _ ) , in the source frame the flares extend from @xmath123  s to @xmath124  s after the start of emission .",
    "although this means that the flares are relatively early as seen in the source frame , the timing of flares varies widely in the cosmological frame of grbs , and there is no indication that absolute timing is a distinguishing characteristic of flares . although the timing analysis described in   [ spec ] and discussed in   [ sec4 ] is done in the observer frame , the conclusions are all based on relative timing and do not depend on the cosmological frame chosen .",
    "all five flares were fit with a spectral model of a power law with exponential cut - off : @xmath125 $ ] , where @xmath126  is the photon energy , @xmath127  is the peak energy of the @xmath51  spectrum , @xmath58  is the photon index , and @xmath128  is a normalization factor .",
    "the first two were fit to bat alone , the last three to bat jointly with xrt .",
    "for the fourth and fifth flares inclusion of the bat data did not significantly affect the fit .",
    "the bars at the bottom of figure  [ fig4 ] indicate the time segments used to fit each of the flares .",
    "the results of the spectral fits are shown in table  [ tbl-3 ] and in the top two panels of figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "although there is no evidence for a smooth power law decay underlying the flares , it is possible that they overlap each other temporally . we have increased the error bars on the flux and @xmath129  values in table  [ tbl-3 ] to account for this overlap by extrapolating the power - law fits (   [ timing ] ) to each flare down to zero and estimating the fraction of the flux falling outside of the nominal start and stop times of the flare ( for the upper limit ) , and the flux possibly due to neighboring flares ( for the lower limit ) .    in the fits to the last three flares an absorption component was included in the model .",
    "the column densities were found to be ( units @xmath130 @xmath38 ) , respectively for flares 3 - 5 , @xmath131 , consistent within errors to a constant value .",
    "one can see in figure  [ fig6 ] that the peak energies of the flares decrease with time and the power law indices show a general softening of the spectra .",
    "furthermore , the apparent linearity of the plots indicates a connection ( or at least a clear trend ) between the five flaring events .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath50 is well fit by a power law , with index @xmath132 .",
    "similarly , the time dependence of the power law index can be fit to a power law with index @xmath133 .    using the redshift @xmath105 for this burst , we extrapolate the total isotropic equivalent radiated energy , @xmath134 ( in ergs ) in the range of 110@xmath135kev , using the definition of @xcite . for the flares ,",
    "the extrapolation fixes the @xmath136  and @xmath58  values derived from the cut - off power law fits , and uses a fixed high energy index @xmath137 . for the prompt emission",
    "we derive a lower limit to @xmath134 from the lower limit to @xmath50 .",
    "the third panel of figure  [ fig6 ] shows @xmath134 as a function of time .",
    "there is a general trend towards lower total energy output of successive flares . here",
    "a fit to a temporal decay power law gives an index of @xmath138 .",
    "in figure  [ fig7 ] we plot @xmath50 against @xmath134 for the flares and the prompt emission .",
    "this enables us to compare the episodes of grb  060714 to the @xmath139 relationships found by @xcite and parameterized by @xcite .",
    "relation of @xcite . ] the prompt emission and the first two flares fall on or very close to the relationships , while the last three flares fall well below them .",
    "this shows that @xmath50 is falling with time more rapidly than the square of the total isotropic equivalent energy emitted in the flares , @xmath140 .",
    "in addition to the spectral properties of the flares , their temporal properties can also help to tell us whether or not these events arise in the external shock ( i.e. are afterglow emission ) .    in order to study the fine time structure of sub - peaks within the flares",
    ", we have derived a robust method to distinguish between a significant change in slope of the light curve ( indicating the start or end of a new subpeak ) and a statistical fluctuation .",
    "using one - second binned light curves for both the bat and xrt data , we applied an iterative method to find each significant episode ( subpeak ) during the times of the flares .",
    "in the first iteration , peaks were defined as local maxima ( points higher than each of their nearest neighbor points ) and valleys as local minima . in successive iterations we culled the peaks by requiring that a significant peak be at least three standard deviations above the valleys on either side . by this method ,",
    "each point in the light curve was assigned to a specific interval : either the rise or fall of a peak or to the periods of slow rise ( @xmath141  s ) or slow decay ( @xmath142  s or @xmath143  s for bat ; and @xmath144  s for xrt ) .",
    "we then fit each interval to a power law : log(r ) vs. log(t ) , where r is the count rate for either bat or xrt ( depending on which flare is being analyzed ) and t is the time since the burst trigger .",
    "finally we use these power law fits to define the actual start , apex and end of each subpeak ( not restricted to light curve bin edges ) .",
    "the start of each episode ( @xmath145 ) is defined as the time at which the rising power law segment of a peak crosses the falling power law segment of either the preceding smooth decay or the previous peak .",
    "similarly the peak time of each interval ( @xmath146 ) is the time at which the rising power law segment of a peak meets the falling power law of the same peak .",
    "the rise time ( @xmath147 ) is thus defined as @xmath148 , while the time associated with each rise episode is @xmath149 .",
    "thus @xmath150 the conclusions drawn in   [ sec4 ] do not depend critically on the exact definitions of @xmath15  or @xmath147 .",
    "the episodes so defined are shown graphically in figure  [ fig5 ] and their main temporal properties in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the temporal decay indices are derived in two ways , detailed in the table caption .",
    "the decay index is first calculated using the burst trigger time @xmath1  as the reference time ( @xmath151 ) , which is the standard way that grb decay indexes are calculated , and would be appropriate for the flares if they were afterglow emission . however , since the resulting values of the decay index @xmath151 are very high , corresponding to a very steep decay which is very hard to produce by the afterglow emission @xcite , we also want to explore the possibility that the flares arise from late time sporadic activity of the central source . in this case the appropriate reference time , @xmath152 , would roughly correspond to the onset of the individual flare or sub - flare whose decay rate we wish to quantify ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "both decay indices are shown in table  [ tbl-1 ] , although values quoted in figure  [ fig2 ] are taken as the decay index @xmath154 . even taking the second definition , @xmath153 , the decay indexes of the flares are all very steep , and except for flare  4 , much steeper than either the decay of the emission just before the first flare ( @xmath155 ) or the decay immediately after the fifth flare ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "the decay slope immediately after the last flare is still much steeper than the afterglow beginning at @xmath157  s , so it is likely part of the prompt emission as well .",
    "we note , however , that @xmath153 does not exceed @xmath158 ( within the statistical uncertainty , where @xmath159 ) , which is the steepest decay allowed by the ` high latitude ' emission @xcite , and thus the decay of the flares and sub - flares is consistent with the expectations for late time intermittent activity of the central source .",
    "the temporal properties of the flares provide strong evidence against an external shock ( i.e. afterglow ) origin for them .",
    "figure  [ dtt_dff ] shows the fractional increase in flux , @xmath160 , versus the ratio of the rise time ( @xmath147 ) to the peak of each flare or sub - flare and the time ( @xmath15 ) from the grb trigger , @xmath161 ( see eq .  [ dt_t ] ) .",
    "it can clearly be seen that large amplitude variations in the flux , @xmath162 , occur on very short time scales , @xmath163 .",
    "this basically rules out an external shock origin for the flares ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also note that the flares are very different from the smooth , late time tail emission in the 20 - 100  kev band which was observed to follow many of the bursts detected by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) @xcite .",
    "the tail emission is temporally much smoother than the flares of grb  060714 , and at a much lower level ( as a ratio to the peak of the prompt emission ) .",
    "also @xcite identify a subset of the batse bursts that have high - energy decay emission consistent with forward external shocks . although it is below detectability for bat , it is possible that the tail emission is seen after the last flare in the @xmath164  = 2.14 decay segment ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this decay index is consistent with the average temporal decay index reported for batse tail emission , @xmath165@xcite .",
    "the major possible sources of variability in the afterglow light curves ( i.e. in the emission from the external shock ) are : ( i ) a variable external density @xcite , ( ii ) a `` patchy shell '' i.e. angular inhomogeneity within the outflow @xcite , and ( iii ) `` refreshed shocks '' i.e. relatively slow shells that were ejected from the central source toward the end of the prompt emission and catch up with the afterglow shock as the latter decelerates to a lorentz factor slightly lower than that of the shells @xcite . such a sharp ( @xmath163 ) large amplitude ( @xmath162 ) rise in the observed flux , as we find for grb  060714 ( see figure  [ dtt_dff ] ) ,",
    "can not be caused by a sudden increase in the external density @xcite .",
    "in addition , a `` patchy shell '' produces @xmath166 @xcite , and can not account for the observed @xmath163 , since new ` bright spots ' in the outflow become visible ( i.e. enter the observed region of angle @xmath167 around the line of sight ) gradually , on the dynamical time ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "finally , `` refreshed shocks '' produce @xmath166 before the jet break time , when the rise time @xmath147 is dominated by the angular time @xmath169 .",
    "after the jet break time , the angular time is @xmath170 ( where @xmath171 is the half - opening angle of the jet ) , and it soon becomes smaller than the radial time @xmath172 ( since @xmath171 remains close to its initial value , @xmath173 , as long as the jet is relativistic ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that the rise time @xmath147 becomes dominated by the radial time @xcite .",
    "however , even in this case @xmath174 , which can not explain the values of @xmath175 and in some cases even as low as @xmath176 , that we obtain in our analysis .",
    "now that we have effectively excluded an external shock origin for the flares , we explore other possible explanations .",
    "these involve sporadic late time dissipation events which are a result of either ( i ) early time activity of the central source on a time scale comparable to the duration of the prompt grb emission , or ( ii ) late time intermittent activity of the central source , which is rather directly reflected in the observed times of the flares",
    ". both types of models may in principal be applicable both for the prompt grb emission and for the flares , due to their roughly similar observed properties .",
    "thus we also wish to address the similarities and differences in the observed temporal and spectral properties of the flares and the prompt emission .",
    "models in the literature that can be included in the first of the two above classes include both emission powered by sporadic magnetic dissipation events within the outflow , possibly induced by its interaction with the external medium @xcite , and late time internal shocks between shells with a small relative velocity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the former models",
    "the temporal and spectral properties of the emission have not yet been worked out in detail , so direct comparison to observations is not possible at this stage .",
    "we now briefly address the latter model .      in this scenario",
    "the difference in the lorentz factors of the colliding shells , @xmath177 , is much smaller than their typical lorentz factor @xmath178 : @xmath179 . for convenience ,",
    "we provide most of the relevant results here , while a detailed derivation of these results as well as some relevant ( but somewhat more technical ) discussion is provided in appendix  [ low_contrast_is ] . in this picture",
    ", later collisions correspond to a smaller @xmath180 , occuring at an observed time @xmath181 and with a duration @xmath182 which satisfy @xmath183 where the first and second shells are ejected at times @xmath184 and @xmath185 with lorentz factors @xmath178 and @xmath186 , respectively .",
    "this makes it hard to account for the short time scale variability @xmath163 , unless the colliding shells were ejected from the source at a time @xmath184 after the grb trigger that is much closer to the observed time of the flare @xmath181 than to the grb trigger @xmath187 ( since @xmath188 )",
    ". however , this corresponds to models of class ( ii ) above ( where the central source is active at late times , close to the time of the observed flares ) , rather than class ( i ) .",
    "@xcite come to a similar conclusion .    in the latter case , which corresponds to class ( ii )",
    ", one can in principal account for the temporal properties of the flares .",
    "we also wish to examine whether their spectral properties and energetics can naturally be reproduced . in this picture",
    "the shells collide at a radius @xmath189 ( the subscript ` is ' is for internal shocks ) which is larger by a factor of @xmath190 ( for the same average @xmath178 ) compared to internal shocks with a reasonably large contrast in the lorentz factor , @xmath191 . for a reasonably large contrast in the lorentz factor ( @xmath192 ) the peak of the @xmath51  spectrum , @xmath50 , typically corresponds to @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the synchrotron frequency of the relativistic electrons with the minimal random lorentz factor in the power law distribution of energies . however , for low contrast internal shocks ( @xmath195 ) , @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the isotropic equivalent kinetic luminosity of the outflow , under the standard assumptions that the fractions of the internal energy behind the shock in the relativistic electrons ( @xmath198 ) and in the magnetic field ( @xmath199 ) are constant .",
    "that is , @xmath194 decreases very rapidly for a small contrast @xmath180 . on the other hand , the cooling break frequency @xmath200 increases as @xmath180 decreases",
    ", @xmath201 therefore , for @xmath195 , @xmath202 and there is slow cooling , i.e. @xmath203 rather than @xmath193 .    for a reasonable value of the magnetic field that is advected with the outflow from the central source , such a field would dominate over a sub - equipartition shock - generated field in the shocked regions of the colliding shells ( see appendix  [ low_contrast_is ] for details ) . in that case",
    "@xmath204 scales `` only '' as @xmath205 , instead of @xmath206 for a field that is a constant fraction of the equipartition value , that was assumed above .",
    "since this is still a very high power of @xmath180 , this does not change the main conclusions .",
    "the very strong dependence of @xmath204 on @xmath180 further decreases the radiative efficiency , which is already low for @xmath195 , since the fraction of the total energy of the colliding shells that is converted into internal energy ( out of which the fraction that goes into relativistic electrons , @xmath198 , may be mostly radiated away for @xmath207 but not for @xmath202 ) is given by @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the ratio of the rest masses of the two colliding shells ( for a fixed contrast of the lorentz factor , @xmath180 , the efficiency @xmath210 is maximal for equal mass shells , @xmath211 ) . for grb  060714",
    "the combined @xmath134 of the five flares is comparable to that of the prompt emission , and that of individual flares is at most one order of magnitude smaller .",
    "this suggests that the kinetic energy that remains in the colliding shells that produce the flares in this scenario is much larger than that of the original shells that produced the prompt emission .",
    "this would result in very significant episodic energy injection into the afterglow shock , i.e. `` refreshed shocks '' which are inconsistent with the temporal properties of grb  060714 ( and may prove problematic for most _ swift _ grbs with x - ray flares ) .",
    "furthermore , since the total @xmath212 of the flares is @xmath213erg , such an extremely inefficient emission would imply a huge remaining isotropic equivalent kinetic energy , in excess of @xmath214erg for @xmath215 , which would imply a very large total kinetic energy ( @xmath216erg ) , even when corrected for the fractional solid angle occupied by the jet ( @xmath217 ) , given that there is no sign of a jet break at least until @xmath218s .",
    "we now examine the more popular version of the internal shocks model , where the difference in the lorentz factor of the colliding shells , @xmath177 , is of the order of their average lorentz factor @xmath178 , i.e. @xmath191 ) . in this case the observed time of the flares reflects the time in which the colliding relativistic shells were ejected from the source @xcite , thus requiring intermittent late time activity of the central source @xcite .",
    "such a sporadic late time activity of the central source may arise ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) by infall of material into the central black hole from instabilities in an accretion disk , or by late time fall - back of material in the collapsar model ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite show that this model is consistent with x - ray flares in a number of different bursts .    in this scenario",
    "the radiative efficiency may be reasonably high ( but still typically @xmath219 ) , and @xmath50 is usually given by @xmath193 .",
    "all of the equations of   [ isa ] still remain valid , up to a factor of order unity , under the substitution @xmath220 . thus @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows that the rise time @xmath223 increases with time ( by about two orders of magnitude ) , while @xmath224 increases by a somewhat smaller factor ( but still a factor of @xmath225 over less than a factor of 3 in time ) .",
    "this alone can roughly account for the decrease in @xmath50 ( see upper panel of figure  [ fig6 ] ) , which decreases by about two orders of magnitude , similar to the increase in @xmath182 .",
    "since for each flare @xmath226 , and @xmath134 of the individual flares decreased by about one order of magnitude , we can infer that @xmath197 decreased by about three orders of magnitude , which requires @xmath178 to decrease by a factor of @xmath227 .",
    "since @xmath228 , this implies a modest increase in @xmath229 by a factor of @xmath230 ( since @xmath231 decreased by a factor of @xmath225 while @xmath232 increased by a factor of @xmath233 ) .",
    "the sharpness of the peak features can be seen in figure  [ fig8 ] in which the rise time @xmath147  and the ratio @xmath234  are plotted against the time since the trigger .",
    "there is a tendency for peaks to become less sharp ( increasing @xmath147 ) with time .",
    "this trend is consistent with the viscous disk evolution model discussed by @xcite , in which both the accretion time scale @xmath147  and the arrival time @xmath15  depend on the radial location of the accreting material within the accretion disk .",
    "@xcite show that the correlation of broader pulse durations with time holds in general even among flares from different grbs , supporting the idea that later flares are coming from larger radius shells .",
    "the lower panel in figure  [ fig8 ] shows that even for the late flares with longer rise times , that @xmath234  remains very small , @xmath235  for all peaks , although @xmath234 tends to increase with time ( it reaches values @xmath236 at early times ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath234 values for grb  060714 can be compared to the statistical samples of flares presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we see that most of the points in our @xmath234  distribution are consistent with the @xcite sample , while the three points with @xmath237  lie outside the distribution .",
    "this is explained by the difference between our definition of @xmath147  ( rise time ) and that used by @xcite ( @xmath238  of a gaussian fit to the peak ) .",
    "although these measures are of the same order of magnitude , our definition leads to very small values of @xmath234  for those peaks with fast rises and slower decays , and in general a broader distribution than seen by @xcite .",
    "given the asymmetric shape of many of the peaks , the rise time may be a truer measure of the variability , since the width can be skewed by a slow decay .",
    "@xcite show @xmath239 , where @xmath240  is defined as the time between when the power law crosses the underlying afterglow and the peak time , a definition which would lead to somewhat larger values of @xmath239  than ours . their distribution , however , has a median value @xmath241  times larger than ours , indicating that the time structure in grb  060714 is unusually sharp compared to most other flares .",
    "the analysis of @xcite also shows that grb  060714 has shorter flare durations and rise times than most bursts .",
    "alternatively , it could be that we find significant structure on smaller time scales than in other works because we are analyzing brighter flares with better photon statistics .",
    "we are also looking at sub - structure in the flares , as is often done with the prompt emission , in which significant temporal structure is usually found down to the smallest time scale that can be measured ( which is limited either by photon statistics or the temporal resolution of the instrument ) .",
    "the successive flares in grb  060714 are each spectrally softer than the preceding flare , as seen in the top panel of figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "the spectral softening of the flares is supportive of models in which multiple masses accrete onto a central black hole at successively later times .",
    "@xcite discuss a model where the collapse of a rapidly rotating stellar core leads to fragmentation and the formation of multiple compact objects which accrete onto the central black hole on time scales which depend on the orbital radii and fragment masses . @xcite and",
    "@xcite suggest that successively later accretion events occur in cleaner , lower density environments , since earlier jets would have excavated channels through the progenitor star .",
    "this suggests that later outflows would have lower baryon loading and hence higher @xmath178 .",
    "@xcite also suggest that tidal effects may smooth later accretion events , lengthening @xmath242 .",
    "both increasing @xmath178  and increasing @xmath243 would lead to a reduction in @xmath50 as a function of time ( see   [ isb ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath50  for the prompt emission is slightly higher than @xmath50  for the first flare , which would be expected since the initial collapse should have the lowest bulk lorentz factor .",
    "however , as demonstrated in   [ isb ]",
    ", while figure  [ fig8 ] indeed shows that @xmath244 increases with time , we find that @xmath178 should have _ decreased _ in time ( by a factor of @xmath245 ) rather than increased with time ( for the standard internal shocks model ) as expected in the above model .    as can be seen in the third panel of figure  [ fig6 ] , @xmath134 decreases with time roughly as @xmath246 , and @xmath197 decreases roughly as @xmath247 .",
    "this is a steeper decline than the expected late - time accretion rate due to fallback in the collapsar model , @xmath248 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in fact drops roughly as @xmath249 , suggestive of a relativistic outflow powered by neutrino - anti neutrino annihilation , where @xmath250 ( this is , of course , highly speculative at this stage ) .",
    "furthermore , such a steep decay of @xmath197 is much steeper than @xmath251 with @xmath252 that is required in order to account for the flat decay phase @xcite .",
    "although the latter requires a temporally smooth outflow , and the flares require intermittent source activity , it is hard to see how the overall temporal decay of such a smooth component and a variable component would be that different .",
    "a striking feature of the spectroscopic results is that not only is @xmath50 declining with each flare , but the low energy spectral index @xmath58 is increasing ( second panel of figure  [ fig6 ] ) , meaning that the flares are becoming successively softer with time .",
    "this is consistent with the third panel of figure  [ fig6 ] which shows the the total isotropic energy is decreasing with time .",
    "hard - to - soft spectral evolution is commonly seen in the prompt emission of grbs @xcite , and the bottom panel of figure  [ fig6 ] shows this trend very clearly for the period before the start of the first flare ( first three points ) . for the flares , not only",
    "is there a softening from flare to flare , but _ within _ each of the first four flares there is a tendency for the spectrum to soften as well . that this well - established feature of the prompt emission of grbs is seen within and across the flares favors similar origins for the flares and the prompt emission . @xcite",
    "have shown for a sample of 27 _ swift_-detected grb flares , that flares exhibit significant hardness - intensity and hardness - fluence correlations which match closely the correlations observed for grbs .",
    "they attribute this hardness evolution to an evolving @xmath127 .",
    "the hardness ratio h @xmath253  s(50100 kev)/s(2550 kev ) is close to unity for the prompt emission and the first two flares , so all three of these episodes fall well within the distribution of long bursts in a grb hardness - duration diagram ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent bat hardness - duration distribution plot ) .",
    "if the overall spectral shape of the flares remains roughly the same , we would expect the hardness ratio h to fall dramatically as @xmath127   shifts downward through the bat energy range ( top panel , figure  [ fig6 ] ) , since the bat spectral index would shift from the super-@xmath127  value of @xmath254  to the sub-@xmath127  value of @xmath255 .",
    "this is indeed what we see in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig6 ] , supporting a common origin for the flares .",
    "another interesting effect is seen in figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "here we see that the prompt emission and the first two flares show a relationship between @xmath50 and @xmath134  quite consistent with the relationships found by @xcite.this supports a similar mechanism for these flares and for the prompt emission , since it suggests that these flares are spectrally and energetically like weak , low @xmath50 bursts .",
    "the last three flares fall well below the relations since for the succession of flares @xmath50 is falling more quickly than @xmath134 , with these flares remaining relatively energetic ( @xmath256erg , even as @xmath50 decreases to @xmath257kev ) .",
    "this argues against a similar origin for these two flares and the prompt emission ( especially since almost all known outliers to the amati relation are on the other side of it , i.e. with a higher @xmath50 for their @xmath134 than expected by this relation , while here the situation is the opposite ) , although there are still possible ways around this .",
    "alternatively , one could certainly argue that such a wide dispersion within a single burst over a wide range of energies should call for a re - evaluation of the amati relationship .",
    "although the @xmath258  relations have been shown to hold for many x - ray flashes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is much less clear whether the relations should hold for late - time flares or individual peaks within bursts .",
    "the time structure of the flares is quite similar to that of the prompt emission .",
    "all of the flares show structure on time scales of @xmath259  s within an overall envelope of duration @xmath260  s. the prompt emission falls within a @xmath225  s envelope , and although the sub - peaks in the prompt emission are not formally significant , there is a suggestion of structure on shorter time scales , especially in the 50 - 100 kev band ( middle panel of figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "certainly short time - scale variations in the prompt emission are a common feature of grbs .",
    "the temporal properties of the series of five flares in the long gamma - ray burst grb  060714 provide strong evidence against an external shock ( or a long lived reverse shock ) origin for these x - ray flares , and are consistent with sporadic late time activity of the central source .",
    "the strongest argument against an external shock origin of the flares is that large amplitude variations in flux ( @xmath261 ) occur on very short time scales ( @xmath262 , where initially @xmath263 , while for all flares or sub - flares @xmath264 ; see figs .",
    "[ dtt_dff ] and [ fig8 ] ) . as discussed in  [ extshock ] , this can not be reasonably accounted for by emission from the forward shock , and similar considerations apply also for a long lived reverse shock .    in the context of the internal shocks model , we show that the temporal properties of the flares ( @xmath262 ) exclude scenarios where the colliding shells are ejected from the source well before the observed times of the flares ( see   [ isa ] ) , and require instead intermittent late time activity of the central source . even in the latter picture , an internal shocks model with small contrast in the lorentz factor",
    "is inconsistent with the observations ( see   [ isa ] ) , for the following reason .",
    "the large @xmath134  of the five flares , together with the small efficiency of such a model in converting the bulk kinetic energy into the observed radiation , requires that a large amount of kinetic energy remain in the shells , a condition that would unavoidably produce very prominent `` refreshed shocks . ''",
    "such episodic energy injections into the afterglow shock are , however , inconsistent with the temporal properties of the smooth x - ray ( and optical ) light curve that follows the flares .",
    "an internal shocks model involving sporadic late - time activity of the central source and a reasonably large contrast in the lorentz factors of the colliding shells (   [ isb ] ) is more consistent with the data .",
    "this type of model can avoid prominent `` refreshed shocks , '' in addition to being able to account for both the observed temporal properties of the flares and the decrease with time of their @xmath136  and @xmath134 .",
    "although the data from grb  060714 are not sufficient for us to conclusively discriminate between particular models of late - time intermittent activity of the central source (  [ relation ] ) , they can start testing and perhaps even eventually discriminate between the different models .",
    "for example , the viscous disk model @xcite can in principal explain the trend of peaks becoming less sharp with increasing time .",
    "the simplest expectations of fragmentation models @xcite , however , are inconsistent with the decrease in the lorentz factor @xmath178  that follows from the time decay of @xmath50  and @xmath134 in the internal shocks model .",
    "moreover , the decline in @xmath134  is steeper than what would be expected from fallback in the collapsar model @xcite , but suggestive of a relativistic outflow powered by neutrino - anti neutrino annihilation .    some evidence in favor of a common origin for the flares and the prompt emission is provided by the spectral and temporal similarities of these components .",
    "as in the prompt emission , there is a clear spectral softening as the flares progress , as well as within most of the flares .",
    "furthermore , both the prompt emission and the flares show time structure on the scale of @xmath254  s within an overall envelope of duration @xmath241  s. on the other hand , an arguments against a common origin is the inconsistency of the final three flares with the @xcite relation , although it is not well - established that this relation should hold for late - time flares .",
    "after the fifth and final flare , grb  060714 showed typical afterglow time profiles consisting of three separate power law segments ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this part of the light curve is a nice example of the `` canonical '' afterglow light curve found by _ swift _",
    "this burst was well observed at late times in the optical ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) and the optical light curve shows both similarities and differences with respect to the x - ray light curve .",
    "the first optical observations showed emission at a typical value for an optical afterglow in the _ swift _ era ( v = 18.6 at @xmath265  s ) , and the optical magnitude remained roughly constant out to at least @xmath266  s , with no indication of an optical counterpart to any of the flares .",
    "similar to the x - ray light curve , the r - band light curve also had a break to a steeper temporal decay , although the optical break occurred about a factor of @xmath119 in time later than the x - ray break . both before and after the break ,",
    "the x - ray and r - band power law temporal decay indices were quite similar .",
    "this suggests a similar origin for the late - time x - ray and optical emission  most likely afterglow emission from the forward shock , probably with some contribution from a long lived reverse shock before and around the time of the break , which might potentially account for the difference in the breaks times between the optical and the x  rays .",
    "the subject of x - ray flares in grbs is an important one and a number of recent papers on _ swift _ bursts have discussed flares , leading to a growing consensus that flares reflect late time activity of the central source . some important examples are @xcite ( the giant flare of grb  050502b ) , @xcite ( grb  050713a ) , and @xcite and @xcite on the analysis of a statistical sample of _ swift _ flares .",
    "this paper adds important new observational results and conclusions to the existing body of literature on flares .",
    "grb  060714 contains an unusually large number of well monitored flares in a single event , and our interpretation of the timing and energetics of these flares not only provides strong evidence against an external shock or a long lived reverse shock model , but allows us to favor the model of late - time activity of the central source and a large contrast in the lorentz factor of the colliding shells over an internal shocks model with a small contrast in the lorentz factors and refreshed shocks .",
    "this event provides the best evidence to date of a continuous and gradual transition in the spectral and temporal properties of the prompt emission and flares , which is very suggestive of a common origin .",

    "here we provide a derivation of the equations for internal shocks with a small contrast in the lorentz factor , that appear in   [ isa ] .",
    "consider two shells , where the ( back edge of the ) first shell ( subscript ` 1 ' ) is ejected from the source at ( lab - frame ) time @xmath267 with lorentz factor @xmath268 and rest mass @xmath269 , while the ( front edge of the ) second shell ( subscript ` 2 ' ) is ejected at @xmath270 with a lorentz factor @xmath271 and rest mass @xmath272 .",
    "we are interested in the limit of low contrast in the lorentz factors of the two shells , @xmath195 , and provide below approximate expressions which are valid in that limit .",
    "the two shells collide at a lab frame time @xmath273 and a radius @xmath229 which satisfy @xmath274 where @xmath275 and @xmath276 so that @xmath277 and @xmath278 where the `` @xmath279 '' is valid for @xmath280 , while the `` @xmath281 '' requires also @xmath195 .",
    "the observed time corresponding to the onset of the resulting spike in the light curve ( or `` flare '' ) is the arrival time of a photon emitted along the line of sight at @xmath229 and @xmath273 , relative to a photon emitted at @xmath282 and @xmath187 , which is given by @xmath283 the exact observed time at which the flare peaks , @xmath181 , would be somewhat later , typically by about the shell shock crossing time .",
    "the latter depends on the details of the shell ( width , lorentz factor and mass density distribution within the shell , etc . ) but is generally expected to be of the order of @xmath284 .",
    "furthermore , the typical width of the spike in the light curve , @xmath182 , is of the order of the angular time ( which is typically also of the order of the radial time or shock crossing time ) , and since @xmath285 we have @xmath286 in order for @xmath177 to be meaningful , we assume that it is larger than the spread in the lorentz factor within each shell , so that the shells do not spread significantly before @xmath229 and their width ( in the lab frame ) is of order @xmath287 .",
    "the values of the spectral break frequencies depend on the physical conditions within the shocked shells .",
    "the isotropic equivalent kinetic luminosity of the outflow is given by @xmath288 while the total luminosity is @xmath289 where @xmath290 is the ratio of electromagnetic to kinetic energies of the outflow , and primed quantities are measured in the comoving frame .",
    "the relative velocity between the two shells is @xmath291 thus , the shocks going into the two colliding shells are newtonian for @xmath195 , and the compression ratio is @xmath292 , where the subscript `` ps '' is for post - shock . for equal density shells ,",
    "the relative velocity of the upstream and downstream fluids is @xmath293 , and the internal energy per unit rest - energy is   of the total energy that is converted into internal energy . as shown below , for a fixed lorentz factor contrast @xmath180 ,",
    "@xmath210 is maximal for equal mass shells . ]",
    "thus , the minimal random lorentz factor of the power - law distribution of relativistic electrons scales as @xmath295 where @xmath198 is the fraction of the post - shock internal energy that goes into such a population of relativistic electrons .",

    "form the source such a field is expected to be primarily in the tangential direction ( normal to the radial direction ) so that it would be amplified in the shock by the compression ratio , @xmath299 where @xmath300 .",
    "thus , for equal mass shells the ratio of the magnetic energy density associated with this field to the internal energy density in the shocked region is @xmath301 , so that the shock compressed advected field would typically exceed an equipartition shock generated field for reasonable values of @xmath238 , i.e. @xmath302 . in this case @xmath303 , where @xmath304 the synchrotron frequency of the electrons with the minimal random lorentz factor , @xmath305 , scales as @xmath306 the random lorentz factor of electrons that cool on the dynamical time ( shell crossing time ) , @xmath307 , scales as @xmath308 where @xmath309 is the compton y - parameter .    the factor of @xmath310 can be safely dropped from the expression for the advected field , since in this case @xmath311 ( it is included here for completeness ) .",
    "this can be seen as follows . in general @xmath312",

    "@xmath316 which for a sub - equipartition field is @xmath317 , but for a field advected from the source and compressed by the shock it is ( see above ) @xmath318 which is @xmath319 unless the magnetization of the outflow is extremely low , @xmath320 .",
    "thus @xmath321 . for a shock - generated field that is a constant fraction of equipartition @xmath309 would also be small unless @xmath322 .",
