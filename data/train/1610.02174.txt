    "as a simple four - atomic molecule , formaldehyde , h@xmath0co , also known as methanal , is of great fundamental interest .",
    "its rotational spectrum is of great importance for radio astronomy .",
    "it was only the seventh molecule to be detected in the interstellar medium in 1969 @xcite , the fourth one that was detected by means of radio astronomy and only the third poly - atomic molecule ; see , for example , the interstellar & circumstellar molecules page of the astrochymist . in the detection letter",
    ", the molecule was observed in absorption toward strong continuum sources , most of them dense and warm molecular clouds , so - called hot - cores .",
    "formaldehyde was also detected in cold dark clouds , which are also dense , with the @xmath4h hyperfine structure ( hfs ) splitting partially resolved @xcite , and in less dense translucent @xcite and even less dense diffuse clouds @xcite .",
    "it was also detected in the circumstellar envelopes of late - type stars , such as the c - rich protoplanetary nebula around v353  aur @xcite , also known as afgl  618 , crl  618 , or the westbrook nebula , the o - rich protoplanetary nebula around qx  pup @xcite , also known as oh231.8 + 4.2 or the rotten egg nebula , or the c - rich asymptotic giant branch star cw  leo @xcite , also known as irc+10216 or the peanut nebula .",
    "the h@xmath0co molecule was the second molecule after oh to be detected in galaxies different from our milky way , here the two near - by galaxies ngc  253 and ngc  4945 @xcite ; it was also detected in more distant galaxies @xcite .",
    "formaldehyde is also one of the few molecules for which maser activity was not only detected in galactic sources @xcite , but also in extragalactic sources @xcite .",
    "numerous minor isotopic species were also detected in space , among them h@xmath5co @xcite , h@xmath0c@xmath2o @xcite , hdco @xcite , and d@xmath0co @xcite as the first multiply deuterated molecule in space .",
    "unlabeled atoms refer to @xmath4h , @xmath6c , and @xmath3o .",
    "the detection of d@xmath0co was made in the orion  kl region , a site of high - mass star formation , where deuterium in formaldehyde was enriched by several orders of magnitudes with respect to the interstellar d / h ratio of @xmath7 .",
    "even higher degrees of deuteration were found in the molecular clouds surrounding low - mass proto - stars , such as iras  16293 - 2422 @xcite .",
    "in fact , deuteration has become a means to investigate the evolutionary stage of low - mass proto - stars .",
    "the h@xmath0co main species may be used to probe the density in denser regions of the interstellar medium @xcite and to determine the kinetic temperature @xcite .",
    "the ratios of h@xmath5co to h@xmath0c@xmath2o have been used to infer the @xmath8c@xmath3o/@xmath6c@xmath2o double ratio in molecular clouds @xcite , which in turn may be used to determine @xmath6c/@xmath8c and/or @xmath3o/@xmath2o ratios .",
    "formaldehyde was also seen in earth s stratosphere employing microwave limb - sounding with the odin satellite @xcite ; it is more commonly studied in the troposphere using infrared or uv / visible spectroscopy among other techniques @xcite .",
    "the molecule was also detected in the comae of several comets , the first one being comet halley , where it was identified tentatively by infrared spectroscopy @xcite , later unambiguously using microwave spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "formaldehyde was among the first molecules whose rotational spectrum and dipole moment were studied by means of microwave spectroscopy @xcite . a plethora of further studies on the rotational spectrum of h@xmath0co , its isotopologues , not only in the ground , but also excited vibrational states were published over the years .",
    "the rotational spectra of h@xmath0co and its isotopologues began to be explored in the terahertz region in the second half of the 1990s , starting with the main isotopologue @xcite .",
    "investigations of hdco and d@xmath0co @xcite , h@xmath5co @xcite , h@xmath0c@xmath2o @xcite , and again h@xmath0co @xcite followed .",
    "the most recent study involved studies of hdco and d@xmath0co samples between 1.1 and 1.5  thz @xcite .",
    "important data were obtained for numerous isotopic species with hd@xmath8c@xmath2o and d@xmath5c@xmath2o being the rarest ones .",
    "in addition , the data sets of the already well - characterized hdco and d@xmath0co isotopic species were improved somewhat @xcite .",
    "excited vibrational states of h@xmath0co were also investigated up to terahertz frequencies @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic parameters were improved by ground state combination differences ( gscds ) for h@xmath0co @xcite and by far - infrared spectra for d@xmath0co @xcite and d@xmath5co @xcite .",
    "in addition , the rotational spectra of formaldehyde in the ground and excited vibrational states were used to characterize a spectrometer system based on difference frequency generation @xcite .",
    "the most abundant formaldehyde isotopic species , for which terahertz data are lacking , is h@xmath0c@xmath1o . assuming that h@xmath5c@xmath2o is too rare to be detected at submillimeter wavelengths",
    ", h@xmath0c@xmath1o is the only one for which terahertz data are needed .",

    "davies et al .",
    "extended the measurements up to 150  ghz with hfs resolved to a varying degree @xcite .",
    "these data were superseded by more extensive and more accurate measurements by cornet et al . which extended up to 294  ghz and which were reported only shortly thereafter @xcite .    in order to improve the predictions of the rotational spectrum of h@xmath0c@xmath1o especially for observations with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) @xcite , we recorded transitions from 0.56  thz up to 1.50  thz . additionally , we recorded transitions of h@xmath0c@xmath2o and h@xmath0c@xmath3o in the region of 1.37  thz to 1.50  thz .",
    "we combined our new data with previously reported data for which the initially reported uncertainties were critically evaluated .",
    "this led to improved spectroscopic parameters which include @xmath1o or h nuclear hyperfine structure parameters .",
    "the rotational spectrum of h@xmath0c@xmath1o was recorded in selected regions between 568 and 658  ghz and between 848 and 927  ghz with the cologne terahertz spectrometer ( cts ) that is described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "two phase - locked backward wave oscillators ( ob  80 , ob  82 ) were used as sources and a magnetically tuned , liquid - he - cooled insb hot electron bolometer ( qmc instruments ltd . )",
    "was used as detector .",

    "rotational spectra of h@xmath0c@xmath1o , h@xmath0c@xmath2o , and h@xmath0c@xmath3o were recorded in selected regions between 1.35 and 1.50  thz using a vdi ( virginia diodes , inc . )",
    "amplified multiplier chain driven by an agilent e8257d microwave synthesizer as source and an insb bolometer as detector .",
    "measurements were carried out in a 3  m long glass cell at room temperature at pressures around 1 to 2  pa for weaker lines , down to around 0.1  pa for stronger lines .",
    "the cell was again equipped with hdpe windows .",
    "our study on low - lying vibrational states @xmath12 of methyl cyanide @xcite may serve as an example for the accuracy achievable with this spectrometer system .",
    "formaldehyde was generated by heating a small sample of commercial paraformaldehyde briefly with a heat - gun .",

    "the asymmetry splitting of h@xmath0c@xmath1o is between those of the heavier and the lighter isotopologue , as can be expected .",
    "the weak feature near 1457378  mhz in the bottom panel is unassigned.,width=264 ]",
    "h@xmath0c@xmath3o is an asymmetric top molecule close to the prolate limit ( @xmath15 with a dipole moment of 2.3317  d @xcite along the @xmath9 inertial axis , which is also the c@xmath0 symmetry axis .",
    "the asymmetry and the dipole moment change only slightly with isotopologue .",
    "the two equivalent h nuclei lead to spin - statistical weight factors of 1 and 3 for rotational states with @xmath16 even ( _ para _ ) and odd ( _ ortho _ ) , respectively . at high resolution",
    ", hfs splitting may be resolved for _ ortho _ transitions .",
    "this is usually only achieved at radio frequencies ( rf ) or in the microwave ( mw ) region .",
    "the splitting was also resolved in astronomical observations of colder environments , but only for @xmath11 and low values of @xmath17 .    even though formaldehyde s proximity to the prolate limit would make watson s @xmath18 reduction the natural choice for fitting of its rotationally resolved spectra to some spectroscopists , use of the @xmath19 reduction",
    "is not so far - fetched .",
    "in fact , it was the @xmath19 reduction that was most commonly applied until fairly recently @xcite .",
    "there was only one detailed consideration of the @xmath18 reduction in earlier reports @xcite , but the results present for the main isotopologue were actually slightly worse in the @xmath18 reduction .",
    "the advantage of the @xmath18 reduction has only lately become increasingly apparent in most of the diagonal distortion parameters which are smaller in magnitude for the sextic distortion parameters in the @xmath18 reduction compared to the @xmath19 reduction , and the differences are more pronounced in the octic distortion parameters @xcite .",
    "the situation is less clear for the off - diagonal distortion parameters , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , etc . in the @xmath18 reduction , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , etc . in the @xmath19 reduction .",
    "but it is the large number of off - diagonal distortion parameters needed to fit the formaldehyde spectra and their relatively large magnitudes which cause the pronounced differences between the two reductions .",
    "prediction and fitting of the rotational spectra were made with pickett s spcat and spfit programs @xcite .",
    "our new data were fit together with previously reported line frequencies , and we consulted the original references to check for the reported uncertainties . in almost all instances , we used the initially reported uncertainties , which is different from some studies where uncertainties had been increased considerably , usually without justification . in very few cases of transition frequencies with larger residuals , the uncertainties were increased slightly or the transition frequencies were omitted from the line lists .",
    "transitions with hfs splitting were used as such . in order to keep the line list short ,",
    "each isotopic species was defined twice in its parameter file , with and without hfs .",
    "overlapping hfs or asymmetry components were treated in the fit as intensity - weighted averages , in contrast to most other fitting programs which treat each overlapping components as one piece of information with exactly the assigned frequency , which may increase the rms error unless uncertainties were increased beyond the usual extent .",
    "some higher order parameters were evaluated from other isotopic species , usually h@xmath0c@xmath3o , by scaling the parameters with appropriate powers of @xmath24 and @xmath25 ; @xmath26 was very similar among the three species and was not considered for scaling . even if such scaling is not the best choice for all parameters , it is often a good approximation",
    "such scaling was used , for example , for @xmath8c and @xmath27n isotopic species of methyl cyanide @xcite .",
    "there are different sign conventions concerning the nuclear spin - rotation parameters and the nuclear spin - nuclear spin coupling parameters .",
    "the sign conventions in spfit are such that in the first case the magnetic moment of h is positive .",
    "this convention is common nowadays in rotational spectroscopy , e.g. , @xcite , but is opposite to nuclear magnetic resonance and to earlier rotational studies , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the sign convention in the second case is that the nuclear spin - nuclear spin coupling parameters of homo - diatomics are negative ; there appears to be no clear preference for this or for the opposite sign convention .",
    "the @xmath1o isotope is the rarest of the stable oxygen isotopes with a terrestrial abundance of 0.00038 @xcite .",
    "the isotope possesses a nuclear spin of 5/2 which gives rise to hfs splitting caused by the nuclear electric quadrupole and the nuclear magnetic dipole moments .",
    "initial predictions of the rotational spectrum of h@xmath0c@xmath1o were generated from the data reported by flygare and lowe @xcite and cornet et al .",
    "@xcite . both studies resolved @xmath1o hfs splitting to a different degree depending on the quantum numbers and the frequency region ;",
    "no hfs splitting caused by the h nuclei was reported .",
    "initial spectroscopic parameters were taken from the latter study which were converted to the @xmath18 reduction subsequently .",
    "additional higher order parameters were derived from h@xmath0c@xmath3o @xcite .",
    "the initially reported uncertainties were used for essentially all transition frequencies and essentially all reported hfs information was used .",
    "some modifications were made to the list of transition frequencies from ref .",
    "there was a typographical error in the @xmath28 center frequency ; an increase by 0.5  mhz is agrees almost within uncertainty with the frequency calculated from the final set of spectroscopic parameters and was used in the final line list .",
    "the remaining data were reproduced slightly outside the uncertainties on average .",
    "therefore , uncertainties of the more poorly fitting data , @xmath29 center frequency and of two hfs splittings of the @xmath30 transition were doubled .",
    "in addition , one hfs splitting of the @xmath29 transition , involving a weak hfs component , was omitted .",
    "these modifications affected obviously the partial rms error of this data set and , to a lesser extent , the rms error of the entire fit ; the parameter values and their uncertainties were only slightly affected .    despite the low @xmath1o isotopic abundance ,",
    "the strengths of the formaldehyde absorption lines were sufficient to obtain reasonable signal - to - noise ratios for h@xmath0c@xmath1o lines in the present study , see fig .",
    "[ asy - splitting ] .",
    "the detected transitions involve @xmath31 @xmath32-branch transitions with @xmath33 and @xmath16 up to 7 . none of the observed transitions displayed hfs splitting , as may be expected .",
    "the spectroscopic parameters determined in the final fit are almost complete up to sixth order , only @xmath34 and @xmath35 were kept fixed to the estimated values .",
    "in addition , two independent quadrupole parameters , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , were determined along with three nuclear spin - rotation parameters .",
    "@xmath38 was retained in the fit because its uncertainty is commensurate with those of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",

    "@xcite are at the upper end ( 1.006 ) , among the larger subsets , rather low values were obtained for the kiel lines ( 0.333 ) @xcite and the cologne lines ( 0.506 ) from the same study @xcite .",
    "the rms error of our new lines is 0.726 .",
    "the rotational and centrifugal distortion parameters of h@xmath0c@xmath1o , which have been determined through fitting , compare favorably with those of h@xmath0c@xmath2o and h@xmath0c@xmath3o , their values are essentially in all instances between those of the heavier and the lighter isotopologue , see table  [ parameters ] .",
    "the value of @xmath96 appears to be an exception , but its uncertainty is large , and an increase by two to three times the uncertainty would bring it to the expected value . the h@xmath0c@xmath2o value of @xmath35 is larger than the h@xmath0c@xmath3o value , but the uncertainty of the former is quite large . also , the decrease of @xmath97 from h@xmath0c@xmath3o over h@xmath0c@xmath1o to h@xmath0c@xmath2o is more pronounced than would be expected from the scaling mentioned above , but the change in the remaining parameters is rather close to what would be expected from such scaling .",
    "the improvement in the distortion parameters of h@xmath0c@xmath1o are quite obvious as the @xmath32-branch transitions were extended from @xmath98 near 300  ghz to @xmath99 near 1500  ghz .",
    "in addition , @xmath16 extends now to 7 , up from previously 4 .",
    "the improvement is also pronounced for h@xmath0c@xmath2o as most of the previous data was limited to below 835  ghz with two additional transitions near 1.87  thz .",
    "the situation is more complex for h@xmath0c@xmath3o .",
    "the uncertainties of some parameters changed only slightly , decreased by factors of around 1.5 to 2 for several others , and even by factors of @xmath794 for @xmath20 and @xmath100 .",
    "the present @xmath1o hfs parameters are slightly better determined than those from the initial investigation @xcite as can be expected because of additional data from a later study @xcite ; uncertainties in the later study are surprisingly worse in part than those in the earlier study .",
    "the spin - spin coupling parameters @xmath18(hh ) may appear quite different among the two isotopic species h@xmath0c@xmath2o and h@xmath0c@xmath3o , but the differences are less than two times the combined uncertainties . because of the uncertainties , one should take with a grain of salt that the value calculated from the ground state hh distance , derived from @xmath101 , is @xmath4817.907  khz and thus closer to the value of h@xmath0c@xmath2o .",
    "inclusion of higher @xmath16 hfs splitting information in the fit improved the uncertainty of @xmath39 by almost a factor of 3 and those of @xmath40 and @xmath38 by factors of @xmath794 .",
