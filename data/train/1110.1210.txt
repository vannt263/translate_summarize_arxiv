    "in fact , the absence of @xmath0-ray pulsations was due to the lack of a good radio timing model @xcite .",
    "we present the lat analysis result using 29 months of data covering aug 4 , 2008 to jan 15 , 2011 .",
    "we selected events with energies greater than 0.1 gev but excluded those with zenith angles larger than 100@xmath9 to minimize contamination from secondary @xmath0-rays from the earth s atmosphere .",
