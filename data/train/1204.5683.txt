    "very recently the h dibaryon was put back on the agenda by lattice qcd calculations of different collaborations , nplqcd  @xcite and hal qcd  @xcite , providing evidence for a bound state at pion masses larger than the physical ones .",
    "it was first proposed thirty years ago  @xcite as a spin and flavor singlet composed of six quarks ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "such a proposal emerged on the context of the mit bag model  @xcite . when applied to all six  quark systems it predicted the existence of only one stable dihyperon with @xmath1 and a mass of 2150 mev , 81 mev below the @xmath2 threshold ,",
    "therefore strongly bound . moreover , being the lightest particle of a two - baryon system with strangeness ( @xmath3 ) 2 , it would be stable against the strong interaction and would necessarily decay weakly .",
    "it was assumed to be a single hadron made of six quarks squeezed in a small region and not a two  baryon state bound in an @xmath4 wave like the deuteron . if this were the case it would open the door to the exotic states , i.e. , hadrons that do not fit in the standard @xmath5 or @xmath6 configurations .",
    "otherwise , the fact that the h dibaryon is the most promising candidate to be the second dibaryonic state after the deuteron has generated a lot of expectation .    on the experimental side , there are very few data in the @xmath7 sector , coming from the inelastic @xmath8 cross section at a lab momentum of around 500 mev / c , and from the elastic @xmath9 and inelastic @xmath10 cross sections for lab momenta in the range of 500  600 mev / c  @xcite . thus , the relevant information we have is indirect and comes from double@xmath11 hypernuclei .",
    "their binding energies , @xmath12 , provide upper limits for that of the h dibaryon , i.e. , @xmath13 .",
    "the first hypernuclear events are quite old and admit several interpretations  @xcite . in 2001",
    "it was reported the so  called nagara event  @xcite , interpreted uniquely as the sequential decay of @xmath14he emitted from a @xmath15hyperon nuclear capture at rest .",
    "the mass and the values of @xmath12 and of the @xmath2 interaction energy , @xmath16 , were determined without ambiguities .",
    "the small value of @xmath16 suggested an attraction weaker than the one previously estimated .",
    "it also gave the most stringent constraint to the mass of the h dibaryon to date , i.e. , @xmath17 mev at a 90% confidence level .",
    "it took almost one decade , but four more double@xmath11 hypernuclear events were reported , from kek e176 and e373 experiments  @xcite , still with preliminary results .",
    "all the details are summarized in table  [ hip ] .",
    ".reported double hypernuclear events .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ contrib ]    in our case the situation is qualitatively similar to refs .",
    "the oge interaction in the three diagonal channels is plotted in fig .",
    "[ gluon ] . the repulsive character of the gluon exchange in @xmath2 exceeds by far the attraction present in @xmath18 , and even more in @xmath19 .",
    "therefore if one looks at the binding energy with only gluon interaction , one finds that the fredholm determinant is larger than 1 , what is associated to a repulsive force .",
    "this is a general conclusion valid for any value of @xmath20 , since it is a multiplicative constant that appears in the three channels and the ratio between the repulsion in @xmath2 and the attraction in @xmath18 is preserved .",
    "indeed , such an approximated ratio ( @xmath21 ) is also found in  @xcite , where a su(6 ) quark model is used , in spite of the huge difference in the quark ",
    "gluon coupling constant , taken there to be @xmath22 1.52 , almost one order of magnitude larger .",
    "the global effect of the chromomagnetic interaction is thus found to be repulsive and therefore one has to keep looking for the responsible of the binding .    in order to appreciate the overall features of any interaction , the @xmath7 ,",
    "@xmath23 two  baryon system has been solved in the one two and three  channel approaches by including only the interactions indicated in each line of table  [ contrib ] .",
    "this gives us information on the character of the interaction involved , whether it is repulsive , weakly attractive or attractive enough to bind the system .",
    "the pseudoscalar interaction generates repulsion , and it contributes only to the @xmath2 channel , being negligible in the others . therefore in a model containing only pse , or oge + pse interactions",
    "there is not a bound state .",
    "the same situation occurs in refs .",
    "@xcite , where a resonance 26 mev above threshold is found in a oge + pse model .",
    "however , the addition of a scalar exchange at the baryonic level provides large attraction so that the binding becomes @xmath24 20 mev . in ref .",
    "@xcite the pseudoscalars also introduce repulsion at short distances , but weaker than in the @xmath25 interaction , in such a way that a bound h particle provided there were medium range attraction as the @xmath26 implies is not discarded .",
    "repulsive pseudoscalar contribution is also found in  @xcite , together with an attractive @xmath26 piece , for a @xmath27 configuration . when considering the two  cluster configuration with a pure chiral content the bound state does not appear .",
    "the reason for that is not a repulsive character of the chiral meson exchange but the lack of strength .",
    "because of that , an increment of the chiral coupling constant in order to properly describe the @xmath28 phase shifts is successful for binding the system .    in our model , the @xmath29 is very attractive and provides by itself the largest values for @xmath30 , from 5.4 mev to 8.3 mev .",
    "let us notice that in a pure @xmath29 model the two transition potentials to @xmath19 would not be possible , since they are due to the scalar meson exchanges .",
    "then the @xmath2 would not be coupled to @xmath19 and so the two  channel calculation would give the same result as the pure @xmath2 , as can be checked in table  [ contrib ] .",
    "when adding the @xmath29 to the oge + pse terms , an unbound but near threshold h dibaryon is obtained in all cases . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , quite close to our treatment , the @xmath29 is the only attractive piece .",
    "the contribution coming from the exchange of the scalar octet is weakly attractive or repulsive , as can be seen in table  [ contrib ] .",
    "however , when supplementing the oge + pse + @xmath29 potential with the octet of scalars , a bound state appears in the two  channel calculation with @xmath31 1.6 mev and @xmath32 7.0 mev in the three  channel case .",
    "it is exactly at this point where the important role of the scalars in our model lies , or more precisely , that of the @xmath33 exchange .",
    "this exchange piece manages to enlarge the binding energy without being attractive itself because it is the main piece in the @xmath2@xmath34 and @xmath34@xmath18 transitions .",
    "it redistributes part of the flux to the much more attractive @xmath34 and @xmath18 channels , originating thus an appreciable increase in the binding .",
    "similar results have been found in the quark model framework of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as deduced from our discussion above , the binding energy of the dibaryon depends mostly on the @xmath29 and @xmath33 exchange potentials .",
    "therefore it is interesting to evaluate the dependence of the binding on the parameters involved in these two interactions , more precisely on their masses and coupling constants .",
    "varying the @xmath29 and particularly the @xmath33 coupling constants along a reasonable range changes the binding energy as seen in fig .",
    "[ depg ] , being these changes larger in the first case . in both cases",
    "@xmath30 grows with the coupling constant .",
    "indeed it can be checked that the change on @xmath35 , that affects the exchange of every meson , produces quite the same results as the change on @xmath36 exclusively .",
    "the dependence on the masses is opposite , see fig .",
    "[ depm ] for details .",
    "the binding decreases as the masses get larger , due to the shorter range of the attraction .",
    "this behavior is more pronounced in the case of @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath30 ranges approximately from 4 mev to 12 mev for @xmath38@xmath39 .",
    "both dependence features ( masses and couplings ) are general , and similar qualitative results were also found in  @xcite .      the flavor symmetry breaking ( fsb ) is expected to be an important effect in the h dibaryon due to the presence of two strange quarks .",
    "the present study has been made under the assumption that su(3 ) is broken .",
    "several sources of symmetry breaking are taking part in our work .",
    "first of all , the strange quark has been assigned a mass different to the light quark masses ( @xmath40 = 555 mev @xmath41 313 mev ) .",
    "it enters in the expressions of the oge and pseudoscalar potentials through the factor @xmath42 .",
    "however , the differentiation of the @xmath43quark in the wave function through the harmonic oscillator parameter @xmath44 gives the larger source of fsb . besides giving different values for the orbital matrix elements ,",
    "it implies the suppression of a number of diagrams because light and strange quarks , as distinguishable particles , can not be exchanged .    in order to roughly evaluate the effect of fsb on the h dibaryon",
    ", the binding energy has been recomputed when some sources of symmetry breaking have been eliminated , i.e. , for @xmath45 313 mev and @xmath46 .",
    "we have variated in fig .",
    "[ par ] the harmonic oscillator parameter as well as the mass of the strange quark , between their values for exact su(3 ) and their true values in our model .",
    "one can see how the binding energy increases as one approaches the exact su(3 ) limit . as a consequence ,",
    "the binding is increased by around 45@xmath47 , giving @xmath24 10.2 mev .",
    "thus , we can conclude that fsb lowers the attraction .",
    "a similar conclusion was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , through a rgm calculation with only oge and confinement potentials . there , the binding energy drastically changed from 38 mev for exact su(3 ) to 26 mev above threshold when the fsb effect was incorporated .",
    "a similar qualitative result was found by ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors concluded that the symmetry breaking diminished the strong attraction coming from the chromomagnetic interaction . from chiral effective field theory  @xcite ,",
    "also the bound state found for exact su(3 ) disappears when using physical values for the baryon and meson masses .",
    "a closer inspection of every component of our potential in all the six channels contributing to h allows us to conclude that the effect of fsb is to diminish the strength of the potential , be it repulsive or attractive .",
    "therefore , depending on the combination of the contributions in any channel , the total potential will be larger or smaller than the one with fsb , but no other general conclusion can be inferred . in our particular case , it turns out that @xmath2 and @xmath18 hardly change , whereas @xmath34 gains attraction when approaching su(3 ) . as for the transitions , the only appreciable change takes place in the @xmath18@xmath34 interaction , that acquires twice as much attraction for the exact su(3 ) case",
    "this result is in contrast with the one found in  @xcite , where the @xmath2@xmath34 interaction is strongly dependent on a fsb parameter .      at first sight",
    "there are two types of possible configurations for the h dibaryon : the six  quark cluster and the two  baryon cluster . as we have already mentioned the first one",
    "was employed in the original work  @xcite , getting a bound h. however latter calculations found that a dibaryon with only the @xmath27 configuration would not bind  @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution was also investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where an extended resonating group method was employed in order to account for the possibility of a change in the baryon wave functions .",
    "again , the dibaryon did not bind in the @xmath27 configuration , being thus necessary to consider less compact configurations , due to the medium range attraction .",
    "when enlarging the size of the wave function , the dibaryon became more attractive , being @xmath48 18.2 mev for the stable solution .",
    "the probabilities however did not drastically change from the more compact ( @xmath27 ) to the more spread ( two  cluster ) configuration . in the latter case",
    "they were found to be @xmath49 0.216 , @xmath50 0.543 and @xmath51 0.242 .",
    "this result is slightly different from that in the flavor singlet state , eq .",
    "( [ hbcon ] ) .",
    "the small difference justifies the perturbative treatment employed , since the wave function was first postulated to be the flavor singlet when performing the rgm calculation .    usually , the flavor singlet wave function , eq .",
    "( [ hbcon ] ) , is first postulated and a perturbative variational calculation is afterwards performed when making use of the rgm treatment .",
    "this is not the case of our work , since the coefficients of the baryon  baryon components of the flavor wave function are obtained as an output of the calculation , without making further assumptions .",
    "the probabilities we got are @xmath49 0.177 , @xmath52 0.446 and @xmath51 0.377 .",
    "they are quantitatively similar to those of the flavor singlet , from what we can infer that in our model the baryon ",
    "baryon wave function is at first approximation su(3 ) symmetric , being the difference between both due to the flavor symmetry breaking effects .      in order to properly understand the @xmath53 sector ,",
    "the analysis performed on the h dibaryon and the results obtained should be complemented studying the other spin  isospin channels . from such a complete analysis , more general and powerful conclusions may arise .    unlike the @xmath54 h dibaryon channel , the @xmath55",
    "is found to be very weakly attractive .",
    "only the @xmath19 interaction is present .",
    "the @xmath56 system does not couple to @xmath57 and the wave function of @xmath2 and @xmath18 is antisymmetric , and therefore vanishes , for @xmath58 even . since @xmath2 is forbidden , there are no lighter states and therefore the @xmath19 state could decay weakly . the @xmath59 potential , fig .",
    "[ t0](@xmath60 ) , exhibits a repulsive core , due to the strong oge interaction that compensates by far the attraction coming from the @xmath29 . at intermedium range",
    "the attractive feature survives but is not enough to form a bound state . the weak attraction in @xmath19 can be enhanced if the tensor force is turned on , however a bound state is still not possible .",
    "this qualitative behavior coincides with that of refs .",
    "@xcite and nijmegen models d and f @xcite .",
    "the big difference from the h channel is an example of the importance of the flavor dependence interaction that model ii incorporates .",
    "a summary of the predictions for the scattering lengths of the @xmath7 two - baryon systems with modern versions of the nijmegen potential  @xcite , the jlich potential  @xcite , and the work by fujiwara _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite can be found in table 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the potentials in the two @xmath61 channels are all attractive . regarding the @xmath62 , both @xmath19 and @xmath56 interactions are strongly attractive , as can be seen in fig .  [ t1](@xmath63 ) .",
    "such a strong attraction provides for the coupled system a binding energy of 4.8 mev .",
    "however this is not the case in ref .",
    "@xcite , where all the potentials with @xmath61 are repulsive . as for the @xmath64 channel ,",
    "there are three coupled interactions : @xmath19 , @xmath56 and @xmath18 .",
    "the three of them are moderately attractive and look very similar , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ t1](@xmath60 ) .",
    "the nijmegen models d and f  @xcite also predict attractive interactions .",
    "however , no bound state appears in our model .",
    "we have performed the first calculation of the h dibaryon in a model constrained by the elastic and inelastic @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath2 cross sections .",
    "special interest has been devoted to analyze the contribution of the different pieces of the interaction and to the effect that the addition of channels to the @xmath2 system produces on the binding .",
    "we obtained a bound h dibaryon , with @xmath24 7 mev , compatible with a plausible extrapolation of recent lattice qcd results and with the nagara event , the most stringent restriction known so far .",
    "the scalar octet exchange , although not giving an attractive contribution by itself , plays a key role as it is the main ingredient of the transition potentials that connect @xmath2 to the more attractive @xmath19 and @xmath18 states .",
    "the probabilities @xmath49 0.177 , @xmath52 0.446 and @xmath51 0.377 are quite similar to those of the flavor singlet so that our wave function is at first approximation su(3 ) symmetric .",
    "finally , a bound state has also been found in the @xmath7 , @xmath67 channel , with a binding energy of 4.8 mev , thus smaller than @xmath30 .",
    "the abundance of events foreseen in a near future and/or the improvement on the lattice calculations will help us to advance in our knowledge of the mechanisms that play important roles in the dynamics of the h dibaryon .",
    "for such a task , a detailed theoretical study as the one presented here could be relevant .",
