    "the production and decay of the @xmath0 lepton at lep has provided a large variety of tests of the standard model . at lep",
    "i , the first phase of the collider running at centre of mass energies close to @xmath1 , the @xmath0 are predominantly produced in pairs , from the annihilation of an electron - positron pair into a z boson . in total , about 500000 pairs have been collected by the four lep experiments , providing a unique environment to study the couplings of the z to heavy leptons , where many extensions of the standard model would induce significant modifications to the expectations .    at these energies ,",
    "more than 20 charged particles are produced on average in hadronic events , allowing a very efficient and clean separation from the tau pairs .",
    "this fact , together with the significant amount of recorded @xmath0 , allows further precision studies on its decay : the leptonic decays are a very noticeable place to study the charged current universality and structure ; the hadronic decays allow the study of the strong interaction at an intermediate @xmath2 ; neutrino physics ...    at lep ii , where the centre of mass energy has been progressively increased until 208 gev , two new broad subjects were opened : the study of the @xmath0 production in the decay of a @xmath3 , permitting additional tests on the charged current and new particles searches , where the @xmath0 plays an interesting role .",
    "each experiment recorded about 700 @xmath4 , which represented about 50000 w pairs produced in total .",
    "only some these subjects will be reviewed here , more details being available in other talks of this conference  @xcite .",
    "different observables in the production of tau pairs through the decay of a z boson , produced in a @xmath5 annihilation at different energies allow the precise measurement of the weak neutral couplings and as a consequence indirect bounds on new physics are set .",
    "the structure of the neutral currents , weak and electromagnetic , was also studied .",
    "the production cross section was extensively studied by all lep experiments , as a function of the centre - of - mass energy .",
    "results are often expressed in terms of the width ( @xmath6=@xmath7 ) ) or of its ratio to the hadronic width : @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath6 is proportional to @xmath9 , the axial and vectorial couplings to the z. being the vectorial coupling much smaller than the axial , this observable essentially provides a measurement of the axial coupling .",
    "another observable studied at lep is the forward - backward charge asymmetry , @xmath10 , defined as the fraction of @xmath11 produced in the forward direction , defined according to the incoming electron .",
    "this quantity , at tree level , at @xmath12 and neglecting @xmath13 exchange , can be expressed as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , providing information on the vector coupling , but not on its sign .",
    "an example of the angular dependence used to extract the asymmetry is shown in figure  [ fig : asim1 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : asim2 ] shows the dependence of this magnitude with the centre of mass energy .    the final results for each of the lep collaborations and its combination , together with the comparison with the standard model prediction as a function of the top quark and higgs boson masses are shown in figures  [ fig : lepgam ] and  [ fig : lepafb ] ( more details in  @xcite ) .",
    "the fermions pairs produced in the annihilation of a z are polarised .",
    "this polarisation is only measurable for @xmath16 , because the @xmath0 lepton decays inside the detector through a weak interaction , violating parity .",
    "the @xmath0 spin can be inferred from its decay products .",
    "different polarisation estimators  @xcite can be built from the measured kinematical quantities , once the decay channel is identified .",
    "figure  [ fig : ptau ] shows an example of the different distributions used and its sensitivity to the polarisation .",
    "furthermore , this polarisation depends on the polar angle through the expression ( at tree level ) : @xmath17 this dependence was studied by the four experiments , measuring the average polarisation in restricted polar angle ranges .",
    "an example of the result is shown in figure  [ fig : ptaucos ] .",
    "the measurement of the polarisation as a function of the production polar angle provides an almost independent measurement of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and as a consequence , independent measurement on the @xmath0 and electron vector coupling ( including its sign ) .",
    "the final results are shown in figure  [ fig : aele ] and  [ fig : atau ] , together with its combination accounting for common systematic errors@xcite .",
    "the measurements discussed above are treated coherently in the standard model framework , including radiative corrections , to extract the vector and axial couplings to the z to any lepton .",
    "the results  @xcite are summarised in figure  [ fig : gvga ] , where the results from sld are also included .",
    "the agreement between the three 68% cl surfaces shows that the universality is fulfilled , setting bounds on unknown standard model parameters and new physics ( see  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "it can also be appreciated that the inclusion of tau polarisation measurements improves significantly the precision on the axial coupling to electron and taus . accepting that the universality is fulfilled",
    ", one can extract the value of @xmath20 from each of these measurements .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : sinw ] and compared to those obtained through other observables .",
    "we can see that the combination of tau observables , give a similar precision to the most precise b quark charge asymmetry .",
    "the structure of the electromagnetic interaction neglecting radiative corrections would be purely vector .",
    "however , the radiative corrections distort this picture .",
    "the standard model predicts a magnetic dipole ( @xmath21 ) of 0.11 , while the electric dipole ( @xmath22 ) is still exactly 0 .",
    "models like lepton compositeness or cp violation scenarios predict a non zero electric dipole and an enhancement of the magnetic dipole .",
    "opal  @xcite and l3  @xcite use the @xmath23 differential cross section in @xmath24 events at the z. the photon energy spectrum is fitted to a linear combination of the * sm * expectation plus an additional contribution from terms with anomalous magnetic or electric dipoles .",
    "the limits at 95% cl are :    @xmath25  ( l3 ) + @xmath26  ( opal ) + @xmath27  e  cm  ( l3 ) + @xmath28  e  cm  ( opal ) +    delphi  @xcite and l3  @xcite also used the @xmath29 collisions at or above the z. the production cross section of this process is also sensitive to the anomalous dipole moments , allowing an additional measurement .",
    "the preliminary results are :    @xmath30  ( l3 ) + @xmath31  ( delphi ) + @xmath32  e  cm  ( l3 ) + @xmath33  e  cm  ( delphi ) +    where @xmath34 is an average form factor not extrapolated to @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , different studies interpret many precision measurement of tau observables in the framework of a possible non - zero dipoles .",
    "one of these studies  @xcite uses lep i tau production cross sections , forward - backward asymmetry and polarisation measurements together with lep ii and tevatron results on @xmath3 decay to @xmath0 to set the limit @xmath37 at 95% cl .",
    "a similar study  @xcite based only on lep i data sets the limit @xmath38 and @xmath39 at 95% cl .    similarly , the radiative corrections modify the pure vector / axial@xmath40vector structure of the weak neutral current .",
    "very small values are predicted by the standard model , but again there is some enhancement in many extensions of the standard model .",
    "all lep experiments have studied the existence of a cp - violating electric - weak dipole using a cp - odd observable , based on tau spin correlation .",
    "l3 has additionally investigated the weak - magnetic dipole defining several parity odd azimuthal asymmetries in hadronic decays .",
    "no new results have been published in the last two years and therefore the interested reader is addressed to previous reviews  @xcite .",
    "all lep experiments have extended the lineshape measurement to the higher energy runs up to centre of mass energy of 208 gev . at these energies",
    ", an additional precision measurement of the @xmath41 interference is performed .",
    "the improvement in the precision of the weak couplings is marginal , but on the contrary there is a significant sensitivity to new physics such as models with additional z bosons or with contact interactions .",
    "results are shown in figures  [ fig : hesig ] to  [ fig : hediff ]  @xcite .",
    "good agreement with the standard model was found in all cases and therefore the results were used to set limits on new physics  @xcite .",
    "delphi has also measured @xmath42 at higher energies  @xcite , giving a result of @xmath43 for an average centre of mass energy of 190 gev , consistent with the standard model expectation .",
    "the weak decay of the tau inside the lep detectors allows a number of interesting studies of the weak charged current .",
    "the w boson decay to leptons provides further information for equivalent tests , but at a different energy scale and with an ` on - shell ' w. in particular , the decay @xmath44 is sensitive to many extensions of the standard model .      in the standard model and assuming v - a coupling and massless neutrino , the tau decay leptonic widths are given by @xmath45 here , @xmath46 is a phase space factor with value @xmath47 for electrons and @xmath48 for muons .",
    "the quantity @xmath49 is a factor due to electroweak radiative corrections , which has the value 0.9960 , in both leptonic decays .",
    "then , the ratio of the two leptonic widths ( or branching ratios ) , provides a direct comparison of the couplings @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52    aleph  @xcite and opal  @xcite have recently presented new preliminary results on the leptonic branching ratios , while delphi  @xcite and l3  @xcite have published their final results .",
    "these results are summarised in figures  [ fig : bele ] and  [ fig : bmu ] together with the results obtained by other experiments  @xcite and the averages .",
    "the comparison between the two branching ratios using expression  [ eqn : brrat ] yields @xmath53 , perfectly compatible with electron - muon universality .",
    "this measurement is almost as precise as the similar test done in pion decay ( @xmath54 ) .    using the @xmath0 and @xmath55 mass and lifetime measurements , together with the analogue of equation [ eqn : gammal ] for muon decay ,",
    "a further universality test can be performed , comparing the @xmath0 couplings to those of the lighter leptons .",
    "figure  [ fig : lifetime ] shows the current results on the lifetime  @xcite , including new preliminary results from delphi  @xcite . assuming universality",
    ", we can combine the electron and muon branching ratios ( correcting the second to account for mass effects ) into a single br for a massless lepton and then the comparison of the muon and tau lifetimes yields : @xmath56 .",
    "the error is split into the contributions from the leptonic branching ratios , the @xmath0 lifetime and mass , respectively , being other contributions negligible .",
    "there is another possible test comparing the tau lifetime and the widths @xmath57 and @xmath58 with the @xmath59 and @xmath60 lifetimes and the widths @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "aleph  @xcite and delphi  @xcite presented recently new preliminary measurements of the branching ratio to @xmath63 .",
    "figure  [ fig : bpi ] shows these results together with those of other experiments .",
    "the comparison gives @xmath64 .",
    "similar tests can be performed with the comparison of the decay widths of the @xmath3 to the different leptons , @xmath65 .",
    "the preliminary analysis of the 40000 w pairs selected at lep gives the branching ratios summarised in figure  [ fig : w ]  @xcite .",
    "they yield the following ratios of the leptonic couplings :    @xmath66 + @xmath67 + @xmath68 + @xmath69 ( e-@xmath55 univ",
    ". assumed ) +    improving significantly the current tevatron measurements  @xcite :    @xmath70 + @xmath71 + @xmath72 ( not ind . from the above ) + @xmath73 ( e-@xmath55 univ .",
    "assumed ) +    the combination of both sets of measurements give :    @xmath74 + @xmath75 ( e-@xmath55 univ assumed ) +    which are significantly less precise than those from the tau decays , but are sensitive to different potential new physics , because the intervening w is ` on - shell ' and the @xmath2 is much higher .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is an intriguing hint of a departure from universality between the @xmath0 and light lepton couplings , a discrepancy at 2.3 standard deviations .",
    "however , this discrepancy is clearly compatible with a statistical fluctuation and it is still to be confirmed with the final publication of the results .",
    "the current state of the art is summarised in figures  [ fig : univemu ] and  [ fig : univtau ] .",
    "these results can be translated into limits on new physics .",
    "the limits on a charged higgs are discussed in the next section in combination with the michel parameters . here",
    "i will just mention an example of bounding the tau neutrino mass and the mixing with an hypothetical @xmath76 family neutrino .",
    "if the @xmath77 mass is different from 0 or a @xmath76 family neutrino with non - zero mixing exist , the different decay amplitudes will be affected  @xcite , with the consequent reflect on the universality of the couplings .",
    "the current measurements allow to set the following limits at 95% c.l . :",
    "@xmath78 mev + @xmath79 +      in the standard model the charged current interaction is assumed to be of the type @xmath80-@xmath81 , a vector and an axial - vector couplings with the same magnitude and opposite sign . however , there is no fundamental reason for that and the existence of more general couplings is still possible .",
    "there are stringent experimental results that this assumption is correct on the muon decay . assuming the lepton number conservation , derivative free , local and lorentz invariant 4-fermion point interaction , the most general form for the amplitude of the tau ( muon ) decay involves 12 complex couplings  @xcite two of which must be exactly 0 .",
    "the tau decay products energy spectra can be expressed in this general form in terms of five parameters , the @xmath77 helicity and the so called ` michel parameters ' , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , in addition of the momentum and @xmath42 . therefore , these parameters are experimentally accessible from these distributions and as a consequence information on the couplings can be inferred .",
    "of all these parameters , only @xmath82 affects the partial widths , while the remaining ones distort the differential cross section but do not change the normalization .",
    "in particular , assuming that the experiments have a leptonic selection whose efficiency does not depend on the momentum and with an infinite momentum resolution @xmath86 , with @xmath87 . then the ratio of the branching ratios provides a measurement of @xmath82 .",
    "however , experimental effects make @xmath88 , but often the experiments do not calculate ( or do not quote ) the precise value for their particular conditions ( see  @xcite for a thorough discussion on the subject ) .    figures  [ fig : michel1 ] to  [ fig : heli ] show the final results from lep experiments  @xcite , compared to other recent results  @xcite and with the standard model expectation for a pure @xmath80-@xmath81 structure , on the assumption of lepton universality for the parameters .",
    "aleph , delphi and opal have also measured the parameters on the assumption that they might be different for electrons and muons , not showing any deviations .",
    "delphi includes in the fit a constraint from universality , with the correct @xmath89 . for the remaining experiments , the @xmath82",
    "is also shown as obtained from the universality on the assumption that @xmath87 ( known to be a reasonably good approximation for lep experiments  @xcite ) .",
    "delphi has studied  @xcite an additional anomalous tensor coupling predicted by a model in which the lagrangian containing derivatives  @xcite . in a similar manner",
    "this term distorts the momentum distributions of the decays products and its strength is measurable .",
    "this strength has been bounded to @xmath90 ( 95% cl ) .",
    "the precision tests on the universality and on the lorentz structure , set bounds on different extensions of the standard model .",
    "the existence of a charged higgs would influence the michel parameters . within mssm",
    ", the @xmath82 parameter would have a non - zero value of @xmath91 , while the rest of the parameters would remain unchanged or with a variation of second order on @xmath92 .",
    "from the previous results we can set the limit at 95% cl : @xmath93 , which is only competitive with direct searches for high @xmath94 .",
    "delphi  @xcite and opal  @xcite have also interpreted their results in the light of the possible existence of an additional vector boson .",
    "delphi sets the limit at 95% cl : @xmath95 for any mixing with the standard @xmath3 or @xmath96 rad for the mixing and any boson mass .",
    "opal sets the limit at 95% cl : @xmath97 for any mixing with the standard @xmath3 or @xmath98 rad for the mixing and any boson mass .",
    "in addition to the previously mentioned @xmath63 decay , aleph  @xcite and delphi  @xcite have recently presented new preliminary results for the branching ratios not involving kaon identification for a large variety of hadronic decays ( with up to 6 neutral or charged hadrons ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : bpipi0 ] to  [ fig : b5pipi0 ] , summarise these results , together with other existing precise measurements  @xcite . when possible , the results are quoted with the kaon component subtracted . for aleph and some cleo measurements ,",
    "this subtraction is done by the same experiment using their own data , while for the remaining cases the w.a .",
    "@xcite were used .",
    "delphi  @xcite and l3  @xcite have also published new measurements on the topological branching ratios .",
    "the results are shown in figures  [ fig : b1 ] to  [ fig : b5 ] . in these measurements ,",
    "the @xmath99 are considered as neutral particles , regardless of its decay , and therefore their possible decays products were not counted as `` primary charged tracks '' in the definition .",
    "these new results basically supersede all the previous results for one and three prongs , solving some remaining inconsistencies .",
    "as an interesting check of the completeness of the @xmath0 decays , or the consistency of the measurements , we can show the perfect agreement between the current average for the direct measurement of the branching fraction to one - prong , @xmath100 with the sum of all the exclusive modes contributing to this topology as measured by aleph , @xmath101 .",
    "it is important to remark that these two numbers are totally independent experimentally and that aleph result is the most precise result for this sum , obtained from a single experiment and fully independent from the topologic result and accounting for all correlations ( @xmath102 results are strongly correlated with the topological br ) .",
    "this comparison shows that there is no hint of the `` missing one - prong problem '' as observed in the eighties , nor of some remaining discrepancies on the late nineties .",
    "the possible violation of the lepton flavour conservation in the weak neutral current was studied looking for z decays to @xmath103 , @xmath104 or @xmath105 .",
    "this measurement benefited from the high statistics of z available at lep .",
    "the following bounds were set at @xmath106 cl : @xmath107      opal has measured the @xmath0 mass at lep  @xcite using a pseudomass estimator , and fitting the mass from the endpoint of this distribution ( figure  [ fig : mas ] ) .",
    "the same figure also shows the comparison with other experiments .",
    "more interesting is that this method can be applied separately to the @xmath108 and @xmath11 , providing for the first time some information on the difference between the mass of positive and negative tau and therefore checking cpt invariance .",
    "a limit of @xmath109 was set at 90% cl .",
    "the study of the @xmath0 lepton production and decay at lep has provided a lot of standard model precision measurements both in the electroweak sector , neutral and charged current universality and structure .",
    "no deviation from the standard model has been observed and therefore indirect bounds on extensions to standard model were set .",
    "lep experiments are also contributing to the improvement on the hadronic decays branching ratios measurement .",
    "these , together with more precise measurements at lep on topological branching ratios rule out the remaining discrepancy in the ` missing one prong problem ' at the 0.1% level .",
