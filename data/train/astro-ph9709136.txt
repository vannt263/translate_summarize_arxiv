    "details about the ghrs spectra of 1545@xmath102101 and 0850@xmath104400 ( see fig . 1 ) will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "a standard voigt profile fitting @xcite to individual lines ( or groups of them ) shows the following features in each field : ( a ) 1545 + 2101 : two lines are found at @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with a velocity separation of @xmath13 . also present",
    "is a group of eight lines , whose redshift centroid is @xmath14 with a velocity dispersion of @xmath2 .",
    "( b ) 0850 + 4400 : two lines are detected at @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with a velocity separation of @xmath17 .",
    "a number of galaxies in these two fields have been observed spectroscopically @xcite to determine their possible connection to the absorption features detected on the qsos spectra : ( a ) 1545 + 2101 : a galaxy is found at @xmath18 , its impact parameter value being @xmath19 kpc .",
    "moreover , there is a group or cluster of six galaxies with redshift centroid @xmath20 and velocity dispersion of @xmath21 , whose impact parameters range from @xmath22.6 to @xmath23 kpc .",
    "( b ) 0850 + 4400 : there is a group or cluster of seven galaxies with redshift centroid @xmath24 and velocity dispersion of @xmath25 .",
    "impact parameter range is @xmath26  @xmath27",
    "kpc ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) .",
    "the fact that we observe a number of resolved lines shows that the absorptions arise in discrete clouds of cold gas instead of arising in a large single diffuse gas component .",
    "the comparison between the cross - correlation function ( cf ) between the galaxies and absorbers in the data with the cf corresponding to a random case shows that there is a non - random connection between the absorbers and the galaxies in our data .",
    "if we assume that galaxies within the real group or cluster are distributed in velocity space according to a gaussian distribution , a one - to - one match between the absorbers and the galaxies can not be established with the present data .",
    "from these results we can conclude the following : ( 1 ) the detection of groups of ly@xmath0  absorption lines implies that some of the ly@xmath0  absorbers do actually cluster .",
    "( 2 ) the velocity spanned by the ly@xmath0  absorption lines arising in groups or clusters is consistent with the velocity dispersion of the corresponding group or cluster of galaxies .",
    "this implies that the ly@xmath0  absorbers arising in those clusters occupy the same region in space than the galaxies themselves .",
    "( 3 ) there is no strong preference for ly@xmath0  absorbers to avoid overdense environments .",
    "( 4 ) ly@xmath0  absorption caused by galaxy groups or clusters arises in discrete clouds of cold gas , rather than in some hypothetical smoothly distributed cold phase in the intracluster medium ."
