    "+ in n linearly coupled cavity arrays , it is interesting to find a localised state , which will never become delocalised due to destructive interference between various paths of transition i.e two photons completely trapped in any one of the cavity .",
    "such a state is , @xmath209 where @xmath199 indicates the two photons are in the @xmath199th cavity and other cavities are in vacuum state .",

    "transition from localised state to delocalised state is blocked at resonance . in order for the transition to occur from localised state to delocalised state , the average energies of them are to be nearly equal and this can only happen for the localised product states by adjusting strength of nonlinearity and detuning .",
