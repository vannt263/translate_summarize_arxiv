    "when partons traverse nuclear medium , whether dense or not , they lose momenta by scattering and gluon radiation . at high transverse momentum @xmath0",
    "the effect can be calculated in perturbative qcd , although its reliability is not expected for @xmath4 gev / c . at low @xmath0 , but high longitudinal momentum @xmath2 , the effect can not be calculated in pqcd , although it is known that partons suffer momenta losses also in the beam direction . experimentally , it is the momenta of the produced hadrons that are measured .",
    "how they are related to the underlying parton @xmath0 and @xmath2 distributions is still controversial .",
    "but even at the phenomenological level it is unknown what the relationship is between the properties of momentum degradation in the transverse and longitudinal directions .",
    "we attempt to shed some light on that relationship in this paper .",
    "there are currently good data on high-@xmath5 produced at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) up to @xmath6 gev / c at various centralities @xcite .",
    "one can therefore deduce the suppression factor from the @xmath0 distributions as a function of @xmath0 and centrality .",
    "there are no comparable data on the @xmath2 distributions from rhic . at lower energies the data of na49 at the sps",
    "provide a good description of the effect of baryon stopping in @xmath3 collision @xcite .",
    "what we need for comparison with the @xmath0 of @xmath7 is the @xmath2 distribution of the produced pions , for which no data are yet available .",
    "however , we do have a model calculation of the pion distribution that contains the degradation effect extracted from the observed proton distribution @xcite ; that will be our input in our study of the suppression factor in the @xmath2 distribution .",
    "the two features that we shall compare are very different : the degradation of @xmath0 in @xmath8 collisions at rhic and the degradation of @xmath2 in @xmath9 collisions at sps . in the absence of any information in the literature on the quantitative or qualitative difference between the two types of degradation effects of the nuclear medium , even a crude estimate of the suppression properties described in a common language would be illuminating . without a study of the type proposed here",
    ", one does not even know whether the strengths of suppression are within the same order of magnitude , especially since the medium in @xmath1 collision at rhic is dense and hot , while the medium in @xmath3 collision at sps is uncompressed and cold .",
    "there is a theoretical issue that is of interest to discuss here .",
    "for some time there has been a school of thought that all hadrons are produced by the fragmentations of partons , not only in the transverse direction in the form of jets ( which is generally accepted ) , but also in the longitudinal direction in the form of breaking of strings ( as in the dual parton model @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of the nuclear medium has been represented by the modification of the fragmentation function @xcite in transverse direction , but that of the longitudinal direction is not known . however , fragmentation of partons is not the only way to produce hadrons .",
    "recent investigations have shown that quark recombination can be important in the high @xmath0 problem @xcite-@xcite , in addition to its relevance originally proposed for the high @xmath2 problem @xcite .",
    "since the multiparton distributions needed for recombination are drastically different in the transverse and longitudinal directions , the effect of the nuclear medium is considerably more complicated . in this paper",
    "we can avoid dealing directly with those complications by putting the emphasis on the phenomenology of the hadrons produced .",
    "for the @xmath0 problem we shall use the scaling form of the data @xcite , while for the @xmath2 problem the calculated @xmath10 distributions that follow from the @xmath3 data will be used .",
    "our task is made easier by not deriving the @xmath0 and @xmath2 distributions , but by focusing on the centrality dependences of those distributions .",
    "suppression of the meson distribution is like jet quenching at the parton level .",
    "in addition to the study of suppression , we shall also consider energy loss , which is another way of quantifying the medium effect .",
    "it corresponds to a shift in @xmath0 or @xmath2 that is necessary for the inclusive cross section in medium to be equivalent to a reference cross section with minimal medium effect .",
    "we shall find interesting results in the shift that are very different from the prediction of pqcd .",
    "that difference is much larger than the difference between the effects on the transverse and longitudinal motions of the produced mesons .    since our comparison is between @xmath0 in @xmath1 collisions and @xmath2 in @xmath3 collisions , they are two steps removed from each other .",
    "when good @xmath2 data on identified pions in @xmath1 collisions become available , they shall then serve as the intermediate station to make possible two one - step comparisons : ( 1 ) between @xmath0 and @xmath2 in @xmath1 collisions , and ( 2 ) between @xmath2 in @xmath1 and @xmath2 in @xmath3 collisions .",
    "what we do here therefore sets the stage for that work to come .",
    "for the @xmath0 distribution of pions in nuclear collisions we use the phenix data on @xmath7 production at midrapidity with @xmath0 extending to as high as 8 gev / c @xcite . a convenient scaling form for that distribution has been found that summarizes the dependence on energy and centrality in terms of a simple analytical formula @xcite .",
    "the quantity that we want to study is the suppression factor @xmath11 , which is the ratio of the normalized @xmath0 distribution @xmath12 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the scaled @xmath0 variable @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the abbreviated notation for the number of participants @xmath17 .",

    "it is of interest to note that in pqcd the shift in @xmath0 of the vacuum spectrum necessary to effect the in - medium spectrum is proportional to @xmath141 @xcite .",

    "we can think of one reason that could possibly explain the closeness of @xmath102 to @xmath98 .",
    "the inclusive cross sections that we examine for the calculation of the suppression factor @xmath11 are for pions , not nucleons or other baryons . whereas leading baryons are strongly related to the valence quarks in the projectile , the pions are more associated with the gluons , which undergo conversion to @xmath159 pair before hadronization .",
    "the depletion of gluons in the nuclear medium can lead to pion suppression in any direction .",

    "our result on the closeness of @xmath102 and @xmath98 may well suggest that gluon depletion is the main mechanism for the suppression of both @xmath0 and @xmath2 distributions .",
