    "the processes @xmath4 are of great interest for our understanding of qcd and the meson structure . in particular , the dependence on the space - like momentum @xmath5 of the incoming virtual photon has been the subject of detailed experimental @xcite and extensive theoretical investigations ( recent references see @xcite ) .",
    "qcd factorization predicts for large @xmath1 the asymptotic behaviour @xcite @xmath6 , with @xmath7 gev denoting the pion decay constant .",
    "similar relations follow for @xmath8 and @xmath9 after taking particle mixing into account . within errors ,",
    "this saturation property is indeed observed for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 form factors .",
    "however , recent high-@xmath1 data up to 35 gev@xmath10 indicate that @xmath11 does not saturate at large @xmath1 but increases further .",
    "fig.[plot:0 ] compares these data with the theoretical formula obtained by brodsky and lepage @xcite which interpolates the values of @xmath12 at @xmath13 given by the axial anomaly with the asymptotic form mentioned above .",
    "so far , no compelling theoretical explanation of the qualitatively different behaviour of the @xmath0 form factor compared to @xmath14 and @xmath15 form factors has been found ; as concluded in @xcite the behaviour of the @xmath0 form factor is hard to explain in qcd .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     these parameters are as follows : for the pion case we use the physical threshold value @xmath16 gev@xmath10 and set also @xmath17 ; then the continuum spectral density vanishes at @xmath18 .",
    "it is less obvious which parameter values for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 cases should be used because their structure is influenced by the strong gluon anomaly @xcite .",
    "we set @xmath19 gev@xmath10 for the @xmath20 channel and @xmath21 gev@xmath10 for the @xmath22 channel .",
    "these values are close to the @xmath23 and the @xmath24 elements of the @xmath25 mass matrix , respectively @xcite .",
    "the fit for the @xmath26 parameters yields @xmath27 gev@xmath10 for both channels .",
    "a good description of the data is achieved , see fig .",
    "[ plot:1 ] .",
    "notice that this value of @xmath26 is @xmath28 of the corresponding value in the @xmath29 channel . with regard to the quark mass values",
    ", one can safely set @xmath30 in ( [ ct ] ) , at least for the @xmath31-meson case .",
    "for the @xmath32 and @xmath33 amplitudes needed for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 form factors the dependence on possible values for @xmath34 and the strange mass value @xmath35 can easily be checked . as long as one sticks to current quark masses there is no visible difference within present accuracies from setting also for these cases @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , the integrals involved above can be calculated analytically .",
    "the result has already been shown in ( [ ff ] ) .",
    "we studied the @xmath37 transition form factors by means of the exact anomaly sum rule which relates the integral over the hadron spectrum to the axial anomaly . in order to isolate the pseudoscalar mesons from this sum rule , we make use of quark - hadron duality in the following way : we replace the integral over the continuum by the integral over the spectral density given by the diagrams of perturbation theory .",
    "we include , however  essentially , by hand ",
    "an additional multiplication factor @xmath38 .",
    "this factor goes to unity for high values of @xmath39 above the resonance region where perturbative qcd should fully describe the continuum .",
    "this multiplication factor serves two purposes : ( a ) it simulates a better threshold behavior and ( b ) it modifies the high-@xmath1 dependence of the integral over the continuum in a way suggested by recent high-@xmath1 measurements .",
    "our main results are as follows :    \\(i ) the strong difference between the hadron spectral density and the perturbative qcd spectral density in the low-@xmath39 region influences only the low-@xmath1 structure , but not the large-@xmath1 asymptotics of the form factor obtained from the anomaly sum rule . using the parameter @xmath26 different from zero and positive ,",
    "one easily obtains a good agreement for the low-@xmath1 data , using threshold values well motivated by phenomenology .",
    "however , the increase observed for the @xmath0 form factor by babar can not be understood by subtleties of the behaviour of the continuum spectral density near threshold .",
    "\\(ii ) the deviation of the large-@xmath1 behaviour of the form factor @xmath40 from the @xmath41 asymptotics predicted by qcd factorization requires a deviation of order @xmath42 between the hadron - continuum spectral density and the lowest - order perturbative qcd spectral density in the region of larger @xmath39 values .",
    "the multiplication factor @xmath43 in ( [ ct ] ) of the general form @xmath44 leads to the form factor which behaves at large @xmath1 as @xmath45 the logarithmic increase of @xmath46 occurs proportional to @xmath26 .",
    "terms of higher order of @xmath3 in @xmath43 do not contribute to the leading @xmath47-behaviour of the form factor .",
    "\\(iii ) the babar data on @xmath40 are well described by using @xmath48 , the true threshold for starting the continuum integral , and by setting @xmath49 , a constant of the formal order of the light - quark mass . since a good description of the data",
    "is obtained in this way , the theoretical treatment of the underlying @xmath50 correlator in the chiral limit appears to be insufficient .",
    "further studies of the effects beyond the chiral limit may be needed .",
    "moreover , one should better understand the possible origin of such @xmath42 terms within qcd .",
    "so far it is a mere conjecture suggested by the data .",
    "\\(iv ) obviously , the proposed @xmath42 term in @xmath43 which modifies the perturbative qcd spectral density leads to the violation of the qcd - factorization theorem .",
    "only if the correction factor @xmath43 is replaced by unity at some high value of @xmath39 , the form factors multiplied by @xmath1 will saturate at @xmath1 larger than this @xmath39-value . since we can not say where this will occur - if it occurs at all - the true asymptotic behavior for very large @xmath1 can not be predicted .    _",
