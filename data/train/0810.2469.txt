    "we should also mention several issues , which may complicate accurate extraction of the anisotropy in nd(o@xmath128f@xmath262)feas single crystals grown by the flux method , which usually results in intergrowths and stacking faults parallel to the ab plane .",
    "such planar defects may increase the apparent anisotropy parameter @xmath175 and give rise to the local modulations of order parameter along the c - axis .",
    "the latter may broaden the resistive transition at @xmath5 and the upward curvature of @xmath6 near @xmath5 , which could mask the two - band effects .    because of very high values of @xmath120 and @xmath119 , our high field measurements up to 60  t are still mostly limited to the temperatures not too far from @xmath5 , particularly for the field parallel to the ab plane . as a result , it is hard to unambiguously evaluate the values @xmath28 , as figs .",

[ fig : fit](a - c ) also indicate the importance of paramagnetic effects in @xmath6 , particularly the fact that extrapolations of @xmath1 to low temperatures based on the measured slope @xmath272 and the whh formula @xmath273 @xcite may grossly overestimate @xmath28 . at the same time , the importance of paramagnetic effects in oxypnictides might open up possibilities of observing first order phase transitions or perhaps the fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov inhomogeneous states at very high magnetic fields .    the temperature dependence of @xmath35 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bc2c ] is rather different from the conventional one - band whh behavior , which may be characteristic of many oxypnictides .",

    "this conclusion is also consistent with the temperature dependent mass anisotropy parameter , @xmath172 , reminiscent of the behavior of mgb@xmath36 @xcite .",
    "yet many important points remains controversial .",
    "first , to explain the observed upward curvature of @xmath35 , we had to assume a rather high difference in the intraband diffusivities , @xmath274 ( depending on the pairing scenario ) , considerably higher than the effective mass difference for @xmath275 and @xmath105 electron pockets predicted by ab - initio calculations @xcite .",
    "one has therefore to assume that scattering on impurities or strong magnetic excitations may produce such big differences in @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "our data enable us to make further qualitative conclusions regarding the s - wave two - band pairing scenarios with and without the interband @xmath201 shift .",
    "the first one is less susceptible to the pairbreaking effect of interband impurity scattering , as follows from eqs .",
    "( [ tcsmall ] ) and ( [ tclim ] ) . indeed , the fact that our nd(o , f)feas single crystal has the same @xmath5 as sintered multiphase polycrystals , seems to suggest that the impurity scattering does not suppress @xmath5 much .",
    "the latter may also indicate that oxypnictides are effectively in the clean limit just because of their short coherence lengths , @xmath276 , where @xmath277 is the mean free path . yet",
    "@xmath203 pairing is certainly more susceptible to the pairbreaking interband impurity scattering .",
    "another indication that the s - wave pairing without the interband @xmath201 shift appears to fit our data better comes from the fact that , in order to explain the observed upward curvature of @xmath35 in fig .  [",
    "fig : fit](b ) in the @xmath203 model , we have to assume the ratio @xmath278 to be about an order of magnitude smaller that @xmath279 required for the more traditional model of strong intraband pairing and weaker interband pairing",
    ". these constraints may reduce the number of possible scenarios of superconductivity in the oxypnictides .    as far as vortex dynamics in nb(f ,",
    "o)feas is concerned , our data presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : rho3 ] and [ fig : rho4 ] show that high magnetic fields parallel to the c - axis mostly shift the resistive transition without significant broadening of the @xmath53 curves , while @xmath32 parallel to the ab plane changes the shape of @xmath53 , but certainly not as strong as for high-@xmath5 cuprates @xcite .",
    "this suggests that despite the rather high values of @xmath175 , thermal fluctuation of vortices in nb(f , o)feas single crystals are weaker than in most anisotropic layered cuprates , like bi-2212 .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the data of other groups @xcite and with the relatively high activation energy @xmath280  k extracted from our transport measurements .",
    "the effect of thermal fluctuations is also quantified by the ginzburg parameter , @xmath281 , where @xmath282 is the in - plane london penetration depth . taking @xmath283 nm , @xmath284  nm and @xmath285  k , we obtain @xmath286 , of the order of the typical ginzburg number for ybco . for two - band superconductors ,",
    "the above estimates of @xmath287 remain qualitatively the same if @xmath175 and @xmath288 are taken for the band with the minimum effective mass or maximum electron mobility @xcite . by contrast , @xmath287 in la(o , f)feas is close to @xmath287 in mgb@xmath36 , about 30 times smaller than @xmath287 in nd(o , f)feas @xcite .    in conclusion , our high - field magneto - transport measurements on single crystal nd(o@xmath289f@xmath290)feas have revealed very high upper critical fields and their anomalous temperature dependencies . we also observe a pronounced thermally - activated flux flow resistivity which may indicate rich vortex dynamics in single layer oxypnictides ."
