    "now for the gslt to be satisfied for the apparent horizon , we evaluate the derivative of internal entropy through eq.([20 ] ) as @xmath73 substituting the values of @xmath74 and using conservation equation , we get @xmath75 according to slt , entropy of the thermodynamical system can never be decreased .",
    "this is generalized in such a way that the derivative of any entropy is always increasing , i.e. , @xmath76 .",
    "thus we have @xmath77dt \\geq 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we conclude that gslt always holds on the apparent horizon .",
    "notice that these laws always hold on the apparent horizon as it is independent of choice of de .",
    "further , we take ghde or grde models as the density of mhde or mrde to check the validity of the first and gslt on the horizon having radius @xmath0",
    ". the mhde density can be calculated by taking the mass of @xmath13-dimensional bh @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the unit @xmath80-sphere area , @xmath81 is the scale of the bh horizon and @xmath6 is the gravitational constant in @xmath13-dimensions related to planck mass @xmath82 . as @xmath83 is the volume of this space ,",
    "so @xmath84 can be written as @xmath85 we can write @xmath86 which implies that @xmath87    for @xmath88 , it gives @xmath89 inserting the value of 4-sphere area , we have @xmath90 comparing this value with the energy density of ghde , it follows that @xmath91 substituting the values of @xmath15 and @xmath92 from eqs.([14 ] ) and ( [ 18 ] ) in ( [ 30 ] ) , the expression for @xmath93 in the form of red shift is @xmath94.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the temperature , entropy and the total energy crossing on this horizon with radius @xmath0 is similar to eqs.([22 ] ) and ( [ 24 ] ) , respectively , with the difference that @xmath95 and @xmath96 are used instead of @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "we can write @xmath99    for the first law , we must have @xmath100 .",
    "equations ( [ 24 ] ) and ( [ 34 ] ) imply @xmath101dt.\\ ] ] since the second term on the right hand side in the above equation is time dependent , so it can never be zero in the evolving universe .",
    "thus @xmath102 this indicates that the first law of thermodynamics does not hold for the horizon of radius @xmath0 . for the validity of gslt on the horizon of radius @xmath0 ,",
    "the derivative of total entropy is as follows @xmath103dt.\\ ] ]    according to the gslt , the total entropy of the thermodynamical system always increases , i.e. , @xmath104 indicating its dependence only on @xmath0 in the de model . in ghde model ,",

    "we have considered kk universe in compact form in the state of thermal equilibrium , similar to frw universe by assuming that our universe is filled with dm and de .",
    "two types of de models , ghde and grde have been used .",
    "it is worth noticing that the grde model can be converted to ghde model by interchanging @xmath108 with @xmath109 .",
    "also , the original density of hde and rde models is obtained for @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively .",
    "the density and pressure for ghde and grde models in terms of red shift @xmath51 are evaluated .",
    "we have investigated the validity of the first and gslt on the apparent horizon in this scenario .",
    "these laws turn out to be independent of the choice of de models , geometry of bh , and also the fifth dimension . hence these laws are always satisfied on the apparent horizon for all kinds of de models .",
    "we have also checked that the first law remains invalid on particle as well as on the event horizon while gslt holds on the particle horizon only .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that kk universe in non - compact form also gives the same results as the variation along the fifth dimension is negligible .",

    "it is concluded that the first law of thermodynamics does not hold on the horizon of radius @xmath0 for both de models .",
