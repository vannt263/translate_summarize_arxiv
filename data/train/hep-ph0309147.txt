    "already more than a decade ago it was realised that the hadronic decay of the @xmath0 lepton could serve as an ideal system to study low - energy qcd under rather clean conditions @xcite . in the following years",
    ", detailed investigations of the @xmath0 hadronic width as well as invariant mass distributions have served to determine the qcd coupling @xmath1 to a precision competitive with the current world average @xcite .",
    "more recently , the experimental separation of the cabibbo - allowed decays and cabibbo - suppressed modes into strange particles opened a means to also determine the mass of the strange quark @xcite , one of the fundamental qcd parameters within the standard model .    until recently , strange quark mass determinations from hadronic @xmath0 decays suffered from sizeable uncertainties due to higher order perturbative corrections .",
    "these result from large qcd corrections to the contributions of scalar and pseudoscalar correlation functions @xcite which are additionally amplified by the particular weight functions which appear in the @xmath0 sum rule . however , a natural remedy to circumvent this problem is to replace the qcd expressions of scalar and pseudoscalar correlators by corresponding phenomenological hadronic parametrisations @xcite , which turn out to be more precise than their qcd counterparts , since the by far dominant contribution stems from the known kaon pole .",
    "additional suppressed contributions to the pseudoscalar correlators come from the pion pole as well as higher exited pseudoscalar states whose parameters have recently been estimated @xcite .",
    "the remaining strangeness - changing scalar spectral function has been extracted very recently from a study of s - wave @xmath5 scattering @xcite in the framework of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath6pt ) with explicit inclusion of resonances .",
    "the resulting scalar spectral function was then employed to directly determine the strange quark mass from a purely scalar qcd sum rule @xcite . on the other hand , now we are also in a position to incorporate this contribution into the @xmath0 sum rule .",
    "nevertheless , as was already realised in the first works on the strange mass determination from the cabibbo - suppressed @xmath0 decays , @xmath7 turns out to depend sensitively on the element @xmath2 of the quark - mixing ( ckm ) matrix . with the theoretical improvements in the @xmath0 sum rule mentioned above , in fact @xmath2 represents one of the dominant uncertainties in the determination of the strange mass .",
    "thus it appears natural to turn things around and , with an input of @xmath7 as obtained from other sources , to actually determine @xmath2 .",
    "it is then found that by far the dominant error on @xmath2 results from the experimental uncertainty on the hadronic @xmath0-decay rate into strange particles @xmath4 , which should be improvable in future experimental analyses .",
    "the main quantity of interest for the following analysis is the hadronic decay rate of the @xmath0 lepton , @xmath8 theoretically , it can be expressed as an integral of the spectral functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 over the invariant mass @xmath11 of the final state hadrons @xcite , @xmath12 .\\ ] ] the appropriate combinations of two - point correlation functions which appear in eq .",

    "as has been indicated in eq .",
    "( [ rtauex ] ) , experimentally , one can disentangle vector from axialvector contributions in the cabibbo - allowed ( @xmath15 ) sector , whereas such a separation is problematic in the cabibbo - suppressed ( @xmath16 ) sector .",
    "the superscripts in the transversal and longitudinal components denote the corresponding angular momentum @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) in the hadronic rest frame .",
    "additional information can be inferred from the measured invariant mass distribution of the final state hadrons .",
    "the corresponding moments @xmath21 , defined by @xcite @xmath22 can be calculated theoretically in analogy to @xmath23 . in the framework of the operator product expansion ( ope )",
    ", @xmath21 can be written as @xcite : @xmath24 @xcite has been pulled out explicitly , and @xmath25 denotes the purely perturbative dimension - zero contribution .",
    "the symbols @xmath26 stand for higher dimensional corrections in the ope from dimension @xmath27 operators which contain implicit suppression factors @xmath28 .",
    "the separate measurement of cabibbo - allowed as well as cabibbo - suppressed decay widths of the @xmath0 lepton @xcite allows one to pin down the flavour su(3)-breaking effects , dominantly induced by the strange quark mass .",
    "defining the difference @xmath29 many theoretical uncertainties drop out since these observables vanish in the su(3 ) limit",
    ". in particular , they are free of possible flavour - independent instanton as well as renormalon contributions which could mimic dimension - two corrections .",
    "before we discuss the determination of @xmath7 and @xmath2 from hadronic @xmath0 decays , let us first comment on the longitudinal contributions to eq .",
    "( [ rtauth ] ) .",
    "as was already remarked above , these contributions are plagued with huge perturbative higher order corrections , which in previous analyses resulted in large corresponding uncertainties for the strange quark mass .",
    "this problem can be circumvented by replacing the theoretical expressions with corresponding contributions resulting from phenomenological parametrisations of the relevant spectral functions .",
    ".comparison of theoretical and phenomenological longitudinal contributions to the ( 0,0 ) moment of the @xmath0 sum rule .",
    "[ tab1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a numerical comparison of theoretical and phenomenological longitudinal contributions @xmath30 for the ( 0,0 ) moment is presented in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite ] on the phenomenological side , the dominant axialvector @xmath31 contribution originates from the strange pseudoscalar mesons , by far the largest part coming from the kaon pole .",
    "also the next two higher exited resonances have been included with a standard breit - wigner resonance shape and resonance parameters as recently estimated in @xcite .",
    "similarly , the axialvector @xmath32 contribution is due to the pion pole as well as higher exited states .",
    "however , because of the smaller pion mass , its contribution is much suppressed .",
    "the dominant uncertainties in the phenomenological results in table  [ tab1 ] are due to the errors in the decay constants @xmath33 and @xmath34 , as well as the higher resonance decay constants .",
    "the longitudinal vector @xmath31 contribution is related to the corresponding scalar spectral function which has been calculated in ref .  @xcite .",
    "below @xmath35 the dominant hadronic systems which contribute in this channel are the @xmath5 and @xmath36 states with @xmath37 being the lowest lying scalar resonance .",
    "the scalar @xmath38 spectral function can then be parametrised in terms of the scalar @xmath39 and @xmath40 form factors .",
    "these form factors were obtained in @xcite from a coupled - channel dispersion - relation analysis .",
    "the s - wave @xmath5 scattering amplitudes which are required in the dispersion relations were available from a description of s - wave @xmath5 scattering data in the framework of unitarised @xmath6pt with resonances @xcite .",
    "generally , from table  [ tab1 ] one observes that phenomenological and theoretical values for the @xmath41 are in rather good agreement .",
    "nevertheless , because of the large uncertainties from higher order perturbative corrections in the theoretical expressions , the phenomenological values are more precise and thus in the following they will be employed for the analysis of the hadronic @xmath0 decays .",
    "the leading term in the su(3)-breaking difference of eq .",
    "( [ delrtaukl ] ) is due to the dimension-2 contribution proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "thus it appears natural to determine the strange quark mass by comparing experimental and theoretical results for @xmath43 . in practice , the moments ( 0,0 ) to ( 4,0 ) have been utilised in the phenomenological analysis . for low @xmath44 ,",
    "the higher - energy region of the experimental spectrum , which is less well known , plays a larger role and thus in this region the experimental uncertainties dominate the strange mass determination , whereas for higher @xmath44 more emphasis is put on the lower - energy region , and there the theoretical uncertainties dominate .",
    "in addition , as will be exploited in more detail in the next section , the strange mass extracted from the @xmath0 sum rules also displays a sizeable dependence on @xmath2 , which is strongest for @xmath45 and becomes weaker for larger @xmath44 . the smallest combined uncertainty is then found for the ( 3,0 ) moment which with present experimental and theoretical errors represents an optimal choice .",
    "taking a weighted average of the strange mass values obtained for the different moments we then find @xmath46 where the uncertainty corresponds to that of the ( 3,0 ) moment , and the value employed for @xmath2 is the central pdg average @xmath47 @xcite , based on the analyses @xcite .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "@xcite . ) to illustrate the dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath2 , one can compare to the result when using the value @xmath48 obtained from a fit imposing unitarity on the ckm matrix @xcite .",
    "the strange quark mass is then found to be @xmath49 the dominant theoretical uncertainties in the results of eqs .",
    "( [ mslr ] ) and ( [ msut ] ) originate from higher order perturbative corrections as well as the su(3 ) breaking ratio of the quark condensates @xmath50 @xcite which arises in the next order dimension-4 contribution to eq .",
    "( [ delrtaukl ] ) . a detailed discussion of all input parameters and a breakup of the various uncertainties can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    before coming to the determination of @xmath2 from the @xmath0 sum rule , a somewhat disturbing observation in the strange mass analysis still needs to be discussed .",
    "namely , it is found that @xmath7 obtained from the lowest ( 0,0 ) moment is largest , and then the strange mass continually decreases for the higher moments . although the individual @xmath7 values are all within one sigma of the central result , it would be important to find out if this @xmath44-dependence stems from a deficiency in the theoretical description or in the experimental data .",
    "one possible explanation of the effect could be missing contributions in the higher - energy region of the experimental strange spectrum , because these would suppress the strange mass determined from lower-@xmath44 moments . a hint in this direction is given by a recent cleo result @xcite , confirming previous cleo and opal results , which found the branching fraction of the exclusive @xmath51 mode to be @xmath52 , nearly 3 sigma higher than the corresponding findings by aleph @xcite , on which the spectral moment analysis is based .",
    "in order to calculate @xmath2 from the su(3)-breaking difference ( [ delrtaukl ] ) , we now require a value for the strange mass from other sources as an input so that we are in a position to calculate @xmath43 from theory . in the following",
    ", we shall use the result @xmath53 , a value compatible with most recent determinations of @xmath7 from qcd sum rules @xcite and lattice qcd @xcite a compilation of recent strange mass determinations is also displayed in figure [ fig : ms ] .    .",
    "[ fig : ms],width=264 ]    since the sensitivity to @xmath2 is strongest for the ( 0,0 ) moment , where also the theoretical uncertainties are smallest , this moment will be used for the determination of @xmath2 . inserting the above strange mass value into the theoretical expression for @xmath54 ,",
    "one finds @xcite @xmath55 where the uncertainty dominantly results from a variation of the strange quark mass within its errors .",
    "assuming unitarity of the ckm matrix in order to express the ckm matrix element @xmath56 in terms of @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ delrtaukl ] ) , we then obtain @xmath57 the first given error is the experimental uncertainty due to @xmath58 and , most importantly , the hadronic @xmath0 decay rate with net strangeness @xmath59 @xcite , whereas the second error stems from the theoretical value for @xmath60 .",
    "even though the theoretical error on @xmath54 is roughly 15% , since individually both terms on the rhs of ( [ delrtaukl ] ) are much larger , for the extraction of @xmath2 , @xmath54 is only a correction and its error rather unimportant",
    ". the theoretical uncertainty in @xmath54 will only start to matter once the experimental error on @xmath4 is much improved , possibly through an analysis of the babar and belle @xmath0 data samples .",
    "taking advantage of the strong sensitivity of the flavour - breaking @xmath0 sum rule on the ckm matrix element @xmath2 , it is possible to determine it from hadronic @xmath0 decay data .",
    "this requires a value of the strange quark mass as an input which can be obtained from other sources like qcd sum rules or the lattice .",
    "the result for @xmath2 thus obtained is @xmath61 where the error is largely dominated by the experimental uncertainty on @xmath4 .",
    "a reduction of this uncertainty by a factor of two would result in a corresponding reduction of the error on @xmath2 , which would lead to a determination more precise than the current pdg average .",
    "furthermore , precise experimental measurements of @xmath62 and the su(3)-breaking differences @xmath43 would open the possibility to determine both @xmath7 and @xmath2 simultaneously .",
    "this can hopefully be achieved with the babar and belle @xmath0 data samples in the near future .",
    "this is particularly important since a very recent new measurement of @xmath63 decays @xcite points to a larger value of @xmath2 , almost 3 sigma away from the present pdg average .",
