    "shellability and constructibility are combinatorial concepts relating to decompositions of simplicial balls .",
    "since each shellable simplicial ball is constructible , the two concepts form a hierarchy . therefore to check constructibility of a simplicial ball is useful to decide whether the simplicial ball is shellable or not .    in  @xcite ,",
    "hachimori presented a necessary and sufficient condition for constructibility of a reduced @xmath0-ball which has no interior vertices .",
    "further he proved that the condition is still necessary and sufficient in the case where a reduced @xmath0-ball has at most two interior vertices in  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "the author researched the case where a @xmath0-ball has interior vertices and no edge which connects interior vertices , and presented a sufficient condition for nonconstructibility . in this paper , we deal with a more general case .    we prepare some notions .",
    "see  @xcite for the terminology of simplicial complexes .",
    "further see  @xcite and  @xcite for the definition of shellability .",
    "first , we recall the definition of constructibility of pure simplicial complexes .",
    "* definition .",
    "* a pure @xmath2-dimensional simplicial complex @xmath3 is _ constructible _ if    \\(1 ) @xmath3 is a simplex , or    \\(2 ) there exist @xmath2-dimensional constructible subcomplexes @xmath4 and @xmath5 such that @xmath6 and that @xmath7 is a @xmath8-dimensional constructible complex .",
    "a simplicial @xmath0-ball @xmath9 is _ reduced _ if each @xmath10-face of @xmath11 has at most one edge which is contained in @xmath12 . as shown in  @xcite , there are operations for reduction and we can obtain a reduced @xmath0-ball from any simplicial @xmath0-ball in finite steps of the operations . furthermore ,",
    "if some reduced @xmath0-ball @xmath13 is obtained from a @xmath0-ball @xmath14 by the reduction and @xmath13 is nonconstructible , then the @xmath0-ball @xmath14 is also nonconstructible .",
    "thus it is essential to consider a sufficient condition for nonconstructibility of reduced @xmath0-balls .",
    "an edge of a simplicial @xmath0-ball @xmath9 is called _ spanning _ if the edge is not contained in @xmath12 and its end vertices are contained in @xmath12 . in  @xcite , we define the notion  strict \" only for a spanning edge of a simplicial @xmath0-ball which has interior vertices and no edge the end vertices of which are contained in the interior of the @xmath0-ball . we redefine the notion to deal with more general cases . for the purpose",

    "let @xmath42 be the union of all maximal interior graph components of @xmath9",

    "see  @xcite and  @xcite for more details .",
    "the constructed simplicial @xmath0-ball satisfies the hypothesis of theorem 3.1 in  @xcite .",

    "there exists exactly one maximal interior graph component in each cube .",
    "the constructed simplicial @xmath0-ball satisfies the hypothesis of theorem 2.3 , thus the @xmath0-ball is still nonconstructible .",
