    "rf energy harvesting techniques have evolved as a promising and cost - effective solution to supply energy for wireless networks @xcite .",
    "the research efforts over the past decade have advanced rf energy harvesting technique in circuit sensitivity , antenna efficiency , rf - to - dc conversion efficiency , and frequency range , etc @xcite .",
    "the recent development has also brought commercial products into the market .",
    "for example , the powercaster transmitter and powerharvester receiver @xcite allow a transmission of 1w or 3w isotropic wireless power , and reception of the power by converting the harvested rf waves into electricity , respectively . in this context , rf signals have been advocated to carry information as well as rf energy at the same time , which is referred to as the concept of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) @xcite .",
    "recently , swipt has drawn great research attention and been intensively investigated , for example , in siso channel without and with co - channel interference , siso relay channel , miso broadcast system , mimo broadcast system , and mimo relay channel  @xcite . for performance analysis of large - scale rf energy harvesting networks ,",
    "stochastic geometry is a suitable tool that characterizes random spatial patterns with point process .",
    "poisson point process ( ppp ) modeling has been applied to analyze rf energy harvesting performance in cellular network  @xcite , cognitive radio network  @xcite , relay network  @xcite , and network - coded cooperative network @xcite .",
    "the study in @xcite investigates tradeoffs among transmit power and density of mobiles and wireless charging stations which are both modeled as a homogeneous ppp .",
    "the authors in  @xcite study a cognitive radio network with energy harvesting secondary users , wherein both the primary and secondary networks are distributed as independent homogeneous ppps .",
    "the maximum throughput of the secondary network has been characterized under the outage probability requirements for both primary and secondary networks .",
    "reference @xcite focuses on the impact of cooperative density and relay selection in a large - scale network with transmitter - receiver pairs distributed as a ppp . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors adopt ppp to model a two - way network - coded cooperative network with energy harvesting relays .",
    "the probability of successful data exchange and the network lifetime gain are derived in closed - form expressions .",
    "different from the above related work , our previous work in @xcite adopts a more general analytical framework with ginibre @xmath0-determinantal point process ( dpp ) modeling , wherein the ppp is a special case when @xmath0 approaches zero . considering a stochastic network with ambient rf sources distributed following a ginibre @xmath0-dpp , we have investigated the uplink performance of an rf - powered sensor adopting separated receiver architecture , which equips the information receiver and rf energy harvester with independent antennas so that they function separately and observe different channel gains .    in this work",
    ", we continue to adopt the ginibre @xmath0-dpp modeling approach , which is suitable for modeling random phenomena where attraction / repulsion is observed . as attraction ( or clustering ) and repulsion are common behaviors in wireless communication systems , such as mobile cellular networks  @xcite and mobile social networks  @xcite , we aim to analyze network performance by characterizing different degrees of repulsion with the ginibre @xmath0-dpp .",
    "in particular , we focus on the downlink performance of a point - to - point swipt system , where the receiver , i.e. , an rf - powered sensor , performs information decoding and energy harvesting simultaneously .",
    "the considered sensor adopts the power - splitting architecture @xcite , which allows the information receiver and rf energy harvester to share the same antenna .",
    "the sensor is assumed to be battery - free and operates based on the instant rf energy harvested from ambient rf transmitters .",
    "based on the considered model , we first characterize the expected rf energy harvesting rate ( in watt ) , then derive the upper bounds of both power and transmission outage probabilities in closed forms .",
    "the performance analysis provides a useful insight into the tradeoff among various network parameters .",

    "we consider a battery - free sensor node harvesting energy from an access point and ambient rf transmitters .",
    "the power supply of the sensor solely comes from the instant harvested rf energy .",
    "figure [ fig : systemmodel ] shows the considered network model , where the sensor node harvests rf energy and utilizes the instantly harvested energy to power the circuit of the sensor .",
    "we assume that the ambient rf transmitters , e.g. , wireless routers and cellular mobiles , which can be deemed as rf energy sources for the sensor , are distributed as a general class of point processes , which will be specified in detail in section  [ sec : geometricmodeling ] .",
    "the sensor is considered to adopt the power - splitting architecture @xcite , which enables the sensor to perform data transmission and rf energy harvesting simultaneously . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : power - splitting ] , with the power - splitting architecture , the sensor is equipped with a single antenna . by adopting a power splitter , this architecture splits the received rf signals into two streams for the information receiver and rf energy harvester respectively . after the power splitting ,",
    "the portion of rf signals split to the energy harvester is denoted by @xmath5 ( 0 @xmath6 ) , and that to the information receiver is @xmath7 .",
    "the rf energy harvesting rate of the sensor node from the access point in a free - space channel @xmath8 can be obtained based on the friis equation  @xcite as follows : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the rf - to - dc power conversion efficiency of the sensor node .",

    "the eigenvectors of @xmath43 are given by @xmath52 we refer to  @xcite for further mathematical details on the ginibre point process .",
    "lastly , we emphasize that the ginibre @xmath0-dpp is stationary , in the sense that its distribution is invariant with respect to translations , c.f .  @xcite .",
    "hence , our choice of @xmath49 centered at the origin instead of @xmath53 is justified .",
    "we define the performance metrics of the sensor node as the expected of rf energy harvesting rate , power outage probability and transmission outage probability .",
    "the expected rf energy harvesting rate is defined as : @xmath54    .\\ ] ]    power outage occurs when the sensor node becomes inactive due to lack of enough energy supply .",

    "the expected rf energy harvesting rate is evaluated as follows , which is similar to the result obtained in theorem  1 in @xcite .",

    "we set the transmission rate requirement to be 0.02kbps and @xmath5 to be 0.5 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : transoutage_rho ] , we see that , with the increase of the transmitter density , the upper bound of the transmission outage probability first decreases quickly , then begins to rebound slowly after a certain point .",
    "the rebound effect is caused by the increased interference due to the growth in transmitter density , which lowers the achievable transmission rate .",

    "[ fig : transoutage_d ] that our analytical bound is tight when @xmath112 is small , and becomes more relaxed with the increase of @xmath112 .",
    "it can be seen that when @xmath112 is small , there is no transmission outage .",
    "this is because when the access point locates within a certain close range near the sensor , the sensor can receive not only enough information rate but also sufficient power from the swipt transmission alone , regardless of the ambient transmitter density .",
    "thus , the transmission outage probability equals zero in this case .",

    "we have analyzed the performance of an rf - powered sensor network in a downlink swipt system with ambient rf transmitters . we have adopted a repulsive point process , called a ginibre @xmath0-determintal point process , which allows to model a network where the locations of the rf transmitters demonstrate repulsion .",

    "our future work will extend the performance analysis from a single - antenna network to a multi - antenna network .",
