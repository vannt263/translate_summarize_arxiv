    "during the last decade , the complex structure of many large - scale networked systems has attracted the attention of the scientific community @xcite .",
    "the availability of massive databases describing these networks allows researchers to explore their structural properties with great detail",
    ". statistical analysis of empirical data has unveiled the existence of multiple common patterns in a large variety of network properties , such as power - law degree distributions @xcite , or the small - world phenomenon @xcite . aiming to replicate these structural patterns ,",
    "a variety of synthetic network models has been proposed in the literature , such as the classical erds - rnyi random graph ( and its generalizations ) nsw01,new09 , the preferential attachment model proposed by barabsi and albert @xcite , or the small - world network proposed by watts and strogatz @xcite .",
    "synthetic network models have been widely used to analyze the performance of dynamical processes on a network . in this direction ,",
    "a fundamental question is to understand the impact of a particular structural property in the performance of the network @xcite .",
    "the most common approach to address this question is to use synthetic network models in which one can prescribe the structural property under study .",
    "the impact of structural features , such as degree distributions @xcite , or clustering @xcite , has been widely studied in the literature following this methodology .",
    "although very common in the literature , this approach presents two major flaws :    1 .",
    "synthetic network models are only suitable to study a very limited range of structural properties . for example",
    ", synthetic random networks presenting structural properties beyond simple degree distributions become intractable from a spectral point of view . 2 .",
    "synthetic network models implicitly induce many structural properties that are not directly controlled and can be relevant to the network dynamical performance .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to isolate the role of a particular structural property using synthetic network models .    since a network s eigenvalues influence the dynamical behavior of dynamical processes that can take place in the network @xcite-@xcite , it is of interest to study the relationship between the structural properties of the network , such as the distribution of degrees , triangles and other substructures , and its eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "in this paper , we propose a novel framework , based on spectral and algebraic graph theory and convex optimization , to compute with low computational overhead global spectral properties of a network from its local structural properties .",
    "in particular , we derive optimal bounds and estimators of spectral properties of interest from structural information .",
    "our results are useful to unveil the set of structural properties that have the highest impact in the eigenvalue spectrum of a network . in particular , in the case of online social networks",
    ", we find that the correlation between the distribution of degrees and triangles in the network plays a key role in the spectral radius .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we review graph - theoretical terminology needed in our derivations .",
    "we also review existing bounds and estimators of spectral properties of a network in terms of structural properties . in section",
    "[ moments from metrics ] , we use algebraic graph theory to derive closed - form expressions for the so - called spectral moments of a network . in section [ optimal bounds ] , we use convex optimization to derive optimal bounds on spectral properties of interest from these moments . we numerically verify the performance of our bounds using real network data in section [ simulations ] , where we also use our results to unveil the set of structural properties with the highest influence on the spectral radius of social networks .",

    "we define the @xmath10-th spectral moment of the adjacency matrix @xmath22 as@xmath26as we shall show in section [ moments from metrics ] , there is a direct connection between the spectral moments and the presence of certain substructures in the graph , such as cycles of length @xmath10 .",
    "we define the set of neighbors of @xmath27 as @xmath28 .",
    "the number of neighbors of @xmath27 is called the _ degree _ of node @xmath27 , denoted by @xmath29 .",
    "we can define several local neighborhoods around a node @xmath27 based on the concept of distance .",
    "let @xmath30 denote the _ distance _ between two nodes @xmath27 and @xmath31 ( i.e. , the minimum length of a walk from @xmath27 to @xmath31 ) .",

    "the set of nodes in @xmath34 induces a subgraph @xmath35 , with node - set @xmath34 and edge - set @xmath36 defined as the subset of edges connecting nodes in @xmath34 .",
    "random network models are currently the primary tool to study the relationship between the structure and dynamics of complex networks blmch06 .",
    "although many random networks have been proposed to analyze structural properties such as the degree distribution @xcite , or clustering @xcite , only random networks including a very limited amount of structural information are currently amenable to spectral analysis .    in the original erds - rnyi random graph with @xmath1 nodes , denoted by @xmath37 , each edge is independently chosen with a fixed probability @xmath38 , @xcite . in this model ,",

    "although very interesting from a theoretical point of view , the original random graph presents very limited modeling capabilities , since the degree distributions of real - world networks are almost never uniform .    in order to increase the modeling abilities of random graphs ,",
    "several models have been proposed in the literature .",
    "for example , given a sequence @xmath42 , chung and lu proposed in @xcite a random graph @xmath43 with an expected sequence of degrees equal to @xmath44 . in this random graph , edges are independently assigned to each pair of vertices @xmath45 with probability @xmath46 .",

    "despite its theoretical interest , random graphs with a given degree distribution are by far not enough to faithfully model the structure of real complex networks .",
    "although random graph models with more elaborated structural properties , such as clustering or hierarchy , can be found in the literature , these models are usually extremely challenging ( if not impossible ) to analyze from a spectral point of view .",
    "the source of this intractability is the presence of strong correlations among the entries of the ( random ) adjacency matrices associated with these models . in section",
    "[ moments from metrics ] and optimal bounds , we introduce an alternative method to analyze the effect of elaborated structural properties , such as clustering and correlations , on the eigenvalues of a network without the use of intractable random graphs models .      in this subsection ,",
    "we review some existing bounds relating structural features of a network , such as the degree distribution , with the spectral radius of the network .",
    "we can find in the literature several bounds on the spectral radius that are not based on random models .",
    "for example , for a graph @xmath5 with @xmath1 nodes and @xmath2 edges , we have the following upper bounds for the spectral radius @xcite:@xmath50where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the minimum and maximum degrees of @xmath5 , and @xmath53 . notice that none of the above bounds take into account the presence of triangles , or other cycles , in the graph .",
    "since many real - world networks present a high density of cycles ( i.e. , social graphs ) , these bounds perform poorly in many real applications . in the following sections , we propose a methodology to derive bounds on spectral properties of relevance in terms of a wide variety of structural features , including the distribution of cycles in the network .",
    "algebraic graph theory provides us with tools to relate the eigenvalues of a network with its structural properties .",
    "particularly useful is the following result relating the @xmath10-th spectral moment of @xmath22 with the number of closed walks of length @xmath10 in @xmath5 @xcite :    [ moments from walks]let @xmath5 be a simple graph . the @xmath10-th spectral moment of the adjacency matrix of @xmath5 can be written as@xmath54 where @xmath55 is the set of all closed walks of length @xmath10 in @xmath5 .",
