    "this system is exactly soluble @xcite , but due to the non - linear nature of the tdgl equation , no exact solutions are available for a general number of dimensions so we must rely on approximate theories .",
    "there are several approximate theories which describe the coarsening dynamics of this system .",
    "however , they all rely on a similar approach in which the order parameter , @xmath2 , is replaced by a smoothly varying auxiliary field , @xmath3 , which has the same sign as @xmath2 , and whose zeros define the domain walls .",
    "the equation of motion ( tdgl ) is then recast in terms of this auxiliary field and various approximations are made in order to make the resulting equation soluble . in the ohta - jasnow - kawasaki ( ojk )",

    "comparison of the ojk results with simulation data @xcite have shown that this theory gives a very good description of the system .",

    "@xcite have pointed out that by plotting @xmath4 against @xmath5 , where @xmath6 thereby removing any adjustable parameters , the ojk theory does not follow the simulation data as closely as previous comparisons , using only @xmath7 , suggested .    an obvious way to examine this approximation",
    "is to treat the neglected non - linear terms as a perturbation to the linearized equation of motion , and this is exactly the approach taken in this paper .",
    "this calculation has two main advantages : firstly , in ojk theory the initial conditions are conventionally taken to be gaussian ; since the evolution equation is linear , this will ensure that the distribution for the auxiliary field at later times is also gaussian .",
    "this feature of ojk theory has been questioned by yeung _ et .",
    "their simulations , which explicitly calculate the auxiliary field distribution , give results which are not exactly gaussian , particularly at small values of the auxiliary field .",
    "we note that recently , in a series of papers , mazenko @xcite , and mazenko and wickham @xcite , have presented an approximate theory which goes beyond the gaussian distribution .",
    "secondly , it has been proposed by both bray and humayun @xcite , and liu and mazenko @xcite , that the ojk approximation becomes exact as the number of dimensions approaches infinity .",
    "evaluating the dimensional dependence of the first order correction term enables this hypothesis to be tested .",
    "the main result of this paper is that the first order correction to the correlation function is @xmath8 , lending weight to the assertion that the ojk theory becomes exact in an infinite number of dimensions .",
    "the exact form of the leading order correction to the two - time correlation function , @xmath9 , is calculated in the large-@xmath0 limit ; this is found to obey both porod s law @xcite , and the tomita sum rule @xcite , with the singular contribution in the correction term modifying the amplitude of the porod tail , and in the limit @xmath10 , it is found that the correction term is of exactly the same form as the zero order result .",
    "the complexity of the calculation , however , has so far prevented the evaluation of higher order terms .    in the following section we present an outline of the ojk calculation , which provides the starting point for the perturbation calculation , we then in section [ sec : perturb ]",

    "note that there is no noise term in this equation , hence the results are only valid for quenches to temperatures where the effect of thermal fluctuations is negligible .",
    "following the work of ohta , jasnow and kawasaki @xcite , the scalar field , @xmath16 , is replaced by a smoothly varying auxiliary field , @xmath17 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 have the same sign . the zeros of the field @xmath3 then define the positions of the domain walls , and the normal , @xmath18 , to a domain wall in the direction of increasing @xmath2 is given by @xmath19 inserting this into the allen - cahn equation for the velocity of an interface @xcite , @xmath20 ; @xmath21 is the curvature of the interface , we obtain : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the speed of the interface in the direction of @xmath18 .",
    "we now seek to obtain an evolution equation for @xmath17 by linking the domain - wall velocity to the time - dependence of the auxiliary field .",

    "the evolution of the field is governed by a simple diffusion equation with diffusion constant @xmath32 . to calculate the correlation function we need to express the original order parameter @xmath2 in terms of the auxiliary field . in the thin wall limit",
    "this is given by @xmath33 , therefore @xmath34 it is convenient to choose gaussian initial conditions for the auxiliary field , with zero mean , and correlator @xmath35 since the evolution equation is linear , the auxiliary field will then have a gaussian distribution at all times . therefore to calculate the correlation function we simply need to evaluate the joint probability distribution for @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",

    "the leading order correction term to the two - time correlation function has been calculated by treating the non - linear terms in the ojk auxiliary - field evolution equation as a perturbation to the linearized equation .",
    "there are two separate motivations for this study .",
    "firstly , since in conventional ojk theory , the evolution equation is linear and gaussian initial conditions are imposed , it follows that the distribution of the auxiliary field must be gaussian at all times .",
    "this assumption , present in many of the approximate theories , has been critically assessed by yeung _ et .",
    "_ @xcite ; they show that the auxiliary field distribution measured directly from numerical simulations is not exactly gaussian .",
    "hence , the advantage of the approach outlined above is that the auxiliary field distribution may take any form .",
    "secondly , it has been proposed by several authors @xcite that ojk theory is exact in an infinite number of dimensions .",
    "determining the dimensional dependence of the correction term allows this hypothesis to be examined .",
    "the main result of this paper is that the first order correction term to the correlation function is @xmath8 , which gives further confidence to the assertion that ojk theory becomes exact in the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "this may be compared to the calculation of liu and mazenko @xcite in which they made a perturbative expansion near @xmath218 and @xmath219 about the approximate theory developed by mazenko @xcite . at large @xmath0",
    ", the first order correction term in their expansion was found to be o(1/d ) .",
    "the relative sizes of these corrections are consistent with numerical simulations @xcite which show that the ojk result provides a marginally more accurate prediction of simulation data for the pair correlation function than the more sophisticated approach of mazenko .",
    "however both results do suggest that the results of ojk are asymptotically exact in infinite - dimensional systems .",
    "we also note that in a recent work , mazenko @xcite has developed a perturbation expansion in the cumulants , which at zeroth order recovers the ojk result . at second order ,",
    "however , significant deviations from the ojk theory are obtained at large @xmath0 , in contrast to the @xmath8 correction obtained here .",
    "the two - time correction term to the correlation function is given by equation ( [ ojk : result ] ) .",
    "in the limit @xmath10 ( on comparing equations ( [ okj : one ] ) and ( [ okj : zero ] ) ) , we find that the correction term has exactly the same form as the zero order result , and the expected ojk result , @xmath216 , is recovered .",
    "if we examine the leading order correction at equal times , given by equation ( [ ojk : pert ] ) , the first observation is that this function is odd in @xmath207 , as is the zero order term .",
    "porod s law @xcite is therefore obeyed ; the @xmath220 term in the expansion ( equation ( [ ojk : expresult ] ) ) modifies the amplitude of the large-@xmath145 tail , which is proportional to the density of defects @xcite .",
    "the absence of an @xmath221 term ensures that the correction term satisfies the tomita sum rule @xcite , @xmath222 , where @xmath223 is the amplitude of the porod tail .",
    "we also note that the perturbation has a negligible effect on the large - distance behavior of the correlation function , see figure [ ojkc1 ] .",

    "although this calculation is only valid at large d , this graph demonstrates that the correction term will have the effect of lowering the ojk result .",
    "this is exactly as expected since humayun and bray @xcite showed by comparing simulation results with ojk theory , that while the ojk result provides an accurate prediction for initial conditions with short - range correlations , the theoretical result is slightly higher than the simulation data .",
    "however , it has also been demonstrated that when long - range correlation are present in the initial conditions , the ojk results are no longer satisfactory @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a possible extension to this work could be to consider the effects of long - range initial conditions on the calculation .",
    "the main limitation of this calculation is that to retrieve the full evolution equation for the auxiliary field ( equation ( [ techojk : evol ] ) ) , we need to set the perturbation parameter , @xmath48 to @xmath226 .",
    "this means that the calculation of the entire correction term requires a sum over all orders in @xmath48 .",
    "however , due to the complexity of the present calculation , i have been unable to evaluate the correction terms at higher orders in @xmath48 . in principle the sum of the higher order terms could alter the @xmath0-dependence of the correction term , but the result remains a strong indication that ojk theory becomes exact in an infinite - dimensional system .",
    "finally , since we noted that the distribution of the auxiliary field is non - gaussian , it is of interest to consider the exact form of this distribution .",
    "this can be calculated as follows ; the distribution can be written in the following form , @xmath227 , this may be expanded in @xmath48 using @xmath228 , to give @xmath229 .",
    "the first term on the rhs reduces to the expected gaussian distribution ; the first order term in @xmath48 can be evaluated using a similar method to the correlation function calculation , i.e. by inserting the expression for @xmath230 , multiplying by the relevant probability distribution function , and completing the integrals .",
