    "carbon monoxide ( co ) , the most common molecule after @xmath4 , is routinely detected in external galaxies .",
    "when exposed to photons of energy greater than 11.1 ev , co is readily photodissociated into atomic carbon and oxygen . as the c@xmath3 ionization potential is only 11.3 ev",
    ", i.e. quite close to the co dissociation energy , neutral carbon may be quickly ionized .",
    "because carbon monoxide , its isotopes , as well as neutral and ionized carbon respond differently to ambient conditions , observations of the relative emission strengths of @xmath2 , @xmath1 , c@xmath3 and c@xmath5 provide significant information on the physical condition of cloud complexes from which the emission arises .",
    "even though far - infrared continuum and [ cii ] lines are much more efficient coolants overall , co and [ ci ] lines are especially important for the temperature balance of cool and dense molecular gas .",
    "co may be observed from the ground in many transitions .",
    "emission from c@xmath5 has been observed towards numerous galaxies from the kao and iso platforms .",
    "emission from c@xmath3 can also be measured from the ground but only under excellent atmospheric conditions . to date , the total number of galaxies detected in [ ci ] is about 30 .",
    "most of the extragalactic 492 ghz [ ci ] measurements are summarized in just two papers , by gerin @xmath7 phillips ( 2000 ) using the cso and by israel @xmath7 baas ( 2002 ) using the jcmt , both on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "these papers include references to more detailed discussions of individual galaxy results .",
    "_ almost all galaxies mapped thus far show strong concentrations of both atomic carbon and molecular gas well contained within radii @xmath8 kpc . _",
    "the area - integrated co and [ ci ] luminosities of the observed galaxy centers cover a large range .",
    "quiescent centers ( ngc  7331 , ic  342 , maffei  2 , ngc  278 , ngc  5713 ) have modest [ ci ] luminosities @xmath9 } \\leq 5 \\kkms$ ] kpc@xmath10 ( with @xmath11kpc@xmath10 corresponding to @xmath12 w ) . starburst nuclei ( ngc  253 , ngc  660 , m  82 , ngc  3628 , ngc  6946 ) have luminosities @xmath13 } \\leq 40 \\kkms$ ] kpc@xmath10 , except m  83 which has only @xmath14 } = 3.6 \\kkms$ ] kpc@xmath10 .",
    "the highest luminosities , @xmath14 } \\geq 50 \\kkms$ ] kpc@xmath10 , are found around the active nuclei of ngc 1068 and ngc 3079 .    in previously observed galactic photon - dominated regions ( pdrs ) , the intensities of @xmath15 and @xmath0=21 @xmath1 line emission",
    "were generally found to be very similar ( cf .",
    "keene et al . 1996 ; kaufman et al . 1999 ) .",
    "such ratios of @xmath15 and @xmath0=21 @xmath1 close to or less than unity are considered to be characteristic of the effects of enhanced uv radiation on molecular gas in pdrs .",
    "however , fig.[profiles ] shows that galaxy centers may have much stronger [ ci ] emission .    in fig.[cilum ]",
    "we present a full comparison of the intensities of the 492  ghz [ ci ] line , the 461  ghz @xmath16 line and the 220  ghz @xmath0=21 @xmath1 line . the @xmath15 line is stronger than @xmath0=21 @xmath1 in all except three galaxies . the highest [ ci]/@xmath1 ratios of about five belong to the active galaxies ngc  1068 and ngc  3079 . generally , the @xmath15 line is weaker than the @xmath0=43 @xmath2 line , but not by much . _",
    "thus , galaxy centers have much stronger [ ci ] emission than the galactic pdr results would lead us to expect . _    in the galaxy sample independently observed by gerin @xmath7 phillips ( 2000 ) more than two thirds also have a ratio [ ci]/@xmath1 @xmath17 .",
    "low ratios are expected in high - uv environments , and in environments with high gas ( column ) densities where virtually all carbon will be locked up in co. in the galaxy , high ratios are found in environments with low gas column densities and mild uv radiation fields , such as exemplified by translucent clouds and at cloud edges .",
    "there , @xmath2 and especially @xmath1 will be mostly dissociated , and gas - phase atomic carbon may remain neutral",
    ". in dense clouds , [ ci ] may be relatively strong if the dominant heating mechanism is some other than uv photons .",
    "the data presented here and in gerin @xmath7 phillips ( 2000 ) suggest that most of _ the emission from galaxy centers does not come from very dense , starforming molecular cloud cores or pdr zones_.",
    "very approximate column densities may be calculated assuming optically thin [ ci ] and @xmath1 emission in the high - temperature lte limit , but accurate results are obtained only by more detailed radiative transfer calculations .",
    "curves illustrating the possible physical condition of gas clouds , shown in fig.[ratios ] , were calculated with the leiden radiative transfer models ( see http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/radtrans/ ) .",
    "the four panels correspond to molecular gas densities ranging from @xmath18 to @xmath19 . in each panel , mostly horizontal tracks mark co gradients @xmath20(co)/d@xmath21 = 0.3 , 1.0 and 3.0 @xmath22 @xmath23 for [ c@xmath3]/co abundances of 0.1 , 0.3 , 1.0 and 3.0 respectively and kinetic temperatures ranging from 150 k ( left ) to 10 k ( right ) are marked .",
    "lines of constant kinetic temperature would be mostly vertical in these panels .",
    "the diagrams contain points representing the observed galaxy centers as well as star - forming regions ( white @xmath7 sandell 1995 ; israel @xmath7 baas , unpublished ; bolatto et al .",
    "2000 ) and the milky way center ( fixsen , bennett @xmath7 mather 1999 ) .",
    "the star - forming pdrs have relatively low neutral carbon versus co abundances ( c@xmath3)/co ) @xmath25 0.10.3 ) . _ most galaxy centers ( especially the active ones ) have significantly higher abundances exceeding unity _ , independent of the assumed gas parameters .",
    "the diagonal distribution of galaxy centers roughly follows lines of constant kinetic temperature .",
    "the actual temperatures @xmath26 and molecular gas densities @xmath27 can not be determined indepently .",
    "for instance , if we assume @xmath28 , we find @xmath29 , whereas by assuming @xmath30 we find more modest values @xmath31 k similar to the dust temperatures 33 k @xmath32 52 k found for these galaxy centers by smith @xmath7 harvey ( 1996 ) . the only available direct determination , for m 82 by stutzki et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , yields @xmath33 and @xmath26 = 50  100 k , in very good agreement with the above . where the molecular line emission in most galaxy centers appears to arise from warm , dense gas ( as opposed to either hot and tenuous or cold and very dense gas ) , the centers of ngc  7331 , m  51 and ngc  4826 seem to be cooler independent of assumed gas density .",
    "fig.[ciifir ] combines [ ci ] line intensities with those of [ cii ] and the far - infrared continuum ( for references , see israel @xmath7 baas 2002 ) .",
    "the results resemble those obtained by gerin @xmath7 phillips ( 2000 ) .",
    "there is no longer a clear distinction between the various types of objects .",
    "the [ cii]/fir ratio increases with [ ci]/fir , but the [ cii]/[ci ] ratio _ decreases _ as [ ci]/fir increases . an upper limit for [ cii ]",
    "places the merger galaxy ngc 660 in the same diagram positions as the ultraluminous mergers arp  220 and mrk  231 observed by gerin @xmath7 phillips .",
    "the highest [ cii]/fir ratios are reached for pdr model gas densities @xmath34 ( gerin @xmath7 phillips 2000 ) , but fully half of the ratios in fig.[ciifir ] are much higher than predicted by the pdr models . in low - metallicity environments , this may be explained by longer mean free pathlengths of energetic uv photons ( israel et al .",
    "1996 ) . however , this is not a credible explanation for high - metallicity ( see zaritsky , kennicutt @xmath7 huchra 1994 ) galaxy centers .",
    "ideally , the observations should be modelled by physical parameters varying as a function of location in a complex geometry . practically , we may attempt to approach such a reality by assuming the presence of a limited number of distinct gas components .",
    "the analysis of multitransition @xmath2 , @xmath1 and [ ci ] observations of half a dozen galaxy centers ( israel @xmath7 baas 2003 and references therein ) suggests that , within the observational errors , good fits to the data can be obtained by modelling with combinations of dense / cool and tenuous / warm gas components . at the same time , however , the energy requirements of keeping relatively large mass fractions at relatively high temperatures , and the peculiar [ ci]/[cii ] ratios again suggest that exploration of excitation models other than pdrs might be fruitful .",
