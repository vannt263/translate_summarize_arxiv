    "<S> @xmath56 has the value @xmath60 along the diagonal for the elements corresponding to the @xmath31 particles which are not involved in the @xmath30 collision , and non - zero elements for the changes in the velocity deviations for particles @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which can be obtained from eqs . </S>",

( [ 15 ] ) we have used the facts that the dynamics of the system is a sequence of binary collisions , labeled by the subscripts @xmath64 with @xmath65 the last collision up to time @xmath24 , where only the velocities of two particles change , separated by free particle motions where none of the velocities change . for low densities , the product of matrices on the right hand side of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 15 ] ) can be thought of as a product of random @xmath66 matrices , since there are no correlations between the collisions in the sequences . </S>",
    "<S> the random elements of the sequence are the particles involved in the individual collisions , the collision parameters of each collision , and the time intervals , for each particle , between the collisions that it suffers . under these circumstances </S>",
    "<S> all of the lyapunov exponents and the ks entropy of the system can be obtained , in principle , by determining the eigenvalues of this product of random matrices , using the known distributions of free times and collision parameters for a dilute gas in equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> the positive lyapunov exponents and the ks entropy can be obtained by using the fact that almost all trajectories in phase space will separate with time @xmath24 , as @xmath24 grows large , since the probability of finding two nearby , but otherwise randomly selected , trajectories that approach each other for arbitrarily long times , is vanishingly small . </S>",
    "<S> the negative lyapunov exponents are obtained by considering the time reversed motion and using the fact that trajectories that approach each other in the forward time direction will separate in the time reversed motion . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis was applied to the random , dilute , three dimensional lorentz gas by latz , van beijeren , and dorfman @xcite who were able to calculate the positive and negative lyapunov exponents by analyzing the products of random matrices similar to those in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 15 ] ) along these lines . due to the increased size of the matrices considered here , </S>",
    "<S> the determination of the individual lyapunov exponents is still a formidable analytical problem . </S>",
    "<S> however the determination of the ks entropy is relatively elementary as we now show .    </S>",
    "<S> suppose that the eigenvalues of the product of the matrices on the right hand side of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 15 ] ) have the form @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> then the logarithm of the determinant of this matrix product will have the form @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> since almost all trajectories will lead to separation , only the positive exponents will appear in this sum . </S>",
    "<S> further , if we assume that the system is ergodic then for long times @xmath24 , all possible collision parameters and free times will appear in the matrices . </S>",
    "<S> thus we can write @xmath69 where @xmath4 is the average collision frequency per particle , so that the number of collisions taking place in the gas per unit time is @xmath70 ( each collision involves two particles ) , and the angular brackets denote averages over the collision rates and parameters , the free time distributions , and the velocity distributions for a dilute gas in equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> we have also used the indices @xmath71 to label the colliding particles in a typical matrix @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> this matrix has a particularly simple structure when expressed in terms of the deviations of the center - of - mass and relative velocities of particles @xmath71 and the velocity deviations of particles @xmath73 which are not affected by the @xmath71 collision , @xmath74 here we have organized the velocity deviation vector so that @xmath75 , where @xmath12 denotes a transpose . </S>",

    "<S> to check these results we have carried out extensive numerical simulations to compute the whole set of lyapunov exponents for equilibrium hard - disk and hard - sphere systems . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is obtained as the sum of all the positive exponents . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the phase - space trajectory , the `` exact '' molecular - dynamics ( md ) algorithm @xcite follows the time evolution of a complete set of infinitesimal vectors @xmath99 , @xmath100 , in tangent space by using eqs . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ 9 ] ) for the discontinuous jumps at a collision . </S>",
    "<S> the tangent vectors are periodically reorthonormalized , and the lyapunov exponents are obtained as the time - averaged logarithms of the renormalization factors .    </S>",
    "<S> the md - method requires the precise localization of the particle collision points and becomes inefficient for very low densities . </S>",
    "<S> we have therefore applied also a variant of the direct - simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) technique to the computation of the lyapunov exponents @xcite , where the phase - space dynamics of the system is modeled by appropriate probability distributions of the collision parameters and of the collision time , and the tangent - space dynamics remains completely deterministic @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for very low densities the dsmc - algorithm becomes exact and is much more efficient than the md method . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected to fail for high densities for which correlated collisions become important .    </S>",

    "<S> our choice for the unit of energy corresponds to a temperature @xmath12 for which @xmath108 in two dimensions , and @xmath109 in three . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of @xmath110 on the collision frequency @xmath4 is displayed in figs . </S>",

    "<S> as indicated by the labels , the diamonds and squares denote md results , whereas the plus signs and crosses refer to dsmc data . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious from the figures , that there is very good agreement between the md and dsmc results for @xmath111 , and that this agreement persists even to the largest collision frequencies of interest . </S>",
