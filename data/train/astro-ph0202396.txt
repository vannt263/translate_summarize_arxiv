    "relativistic jets have been observed in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and microquasars in our galaxy , and it is believed that they originate from the regions near accreting black holes . to investigate the dynamics of accretion disks and the associated jet formation , we use our newly developed full 3-d grmhd code .",
    "recently , koide , shibata , & kudoh ( 1999 ) have investigated the dynamics of an accretion disk initially threaded by a uniform poloidal magnetic field in a non - rotating corona ( either in a state of steady fall or in hydrostatic equilibrium ) around a non - rotating black hole .",
    "the numerical results show that the disk loses angular momentum by magnetic braking , then falls into the black hole . the infalling motion of the disk , which is faster than in the non - relativistic case because of the general - relativistic effect below @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the schwarzschild radius ) , is strongly decelerated at the shock formed by the centrifugal force around @xmath2 by the rotation of the disk .",
    "plasmas near the shock are accelerated by the @xmath3 force , which forms bipolar relativistic jets . inside this _ magnetically driven jet _ , the gradient of gas pressure also generates a jet over the shock region ( _ gas - pressure - driven jet _ ) .",
    "this _ two - layered jet structure _ is formed both in a hydrostatic corona and in a steady - state falling corona .",
    "koide et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have also developed a new grmhd code in kerr geometry and have found that , with a rapidly rotating ( @xmath4 ) black - hole magnetosphere , the maximum velocity of the jet is 0.9 c and its terminal velocity 0.85 c. all of the previous 2-d grmhd simulations described here were made assuming axisymmetry with respect to the @xmath5-axis and mirror symmetry with respect to the plane @xmath6 ; the axisymmetric assumption suppressed the azimuthal instabilities .",
    "our basic equations are those of maxwell for the fields and a set of general - relativistic equations representing the plasma , namely the equations of conservation of mass , momentum , and energy for a single - component conducting fluid ( weinberg 1972 ; thorne et al .",
    "in making the simulations , we use these equations with the 3 + 1 formalism ( for details , see koide , shibata , & kudoh 1999 ) .",
    "in order to investigate how accretion disks near black holes evolve under the influence of accretion instabilities such as the magnetorotational instability , the use of a fully 3-d grmhd is essential .      in the assumed initial state , the simulation region",
    "is divided into two parts : a background corona around a black hole , and an accretion disk ( fig .",
    "1a and 1b ) .",
    "the coronal plasma is set in a state of transonic free - fall flow , as in the case of the transonic flows with @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; here the sonic point is located at @xmath9 .",
    "the keplerian disk in the corona is set in the following way .",
    "the disk region is located at @xmath10^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "( note that this equation reduces to the newtonian keplerian velocity @xmath11 in the non - relativistic limit @xmath12 ) .",
    "the pressure of both the corona and the disk are assumed equal to that of the transonic solution .",
    "the initial conditions for the entire plasma around the black hole are : @xmath13    @xmath14    @xmath15    where we set @xmath16 ; the smoothing length is @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , there is a magnetic field crossing the accretion disk perpendicularly .",
    "we set it to the wald solution ( wald 1974 ) , which represents the uniform magnetic field around a kerr black hole : @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the lapse function , @xmath21 ) . at the inner edge of the accretion disk ,",
    "the proper alfvn velocity is @xmath22 in a typical case with @xmath23 , where the alfvn velocity in the fiducial observer @xmath24/c^2}}.\\ ] ] the plasma beta of the corona at @xmath25 is @xmath26 .",
    "the simulation is performed in the region @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 with @xmath30 meshes .",
    "the effective linear mesh widths at @xmath31 and at @xmath32 are @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , while the angular spacings along the polar and azimuthal directions are @xmath35 rad .",
    "a radiative boundary condition is imposed at @xmath36 and at @xmath37 : @xmath38 where the superscripts @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote the time steps and the subscripts 0 and 1 refer to the boundary and to its neighbor meshes , respectively .",
    "the computations were made on an origin 2000 computer with 0.898 gb internal memory , and they used about 47 hours of cpu time for 10000 time steps with @xmath30 meshes .",
    "figure 1 shows the evolution of 3-d simulation performed in the region @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 with @xmath30 meshes .",
    "the parameters used in this simulation are the same as those of the axisymmetric simulations shown in fig .",
    "6 of koide , shibata , & kudoh ( 1999 ) . in this figure",
    ", the colored shading shows the proper mass density ( ( a ) and ( c ) ) and the pressure ( ( b ) and ( d ) ) on logarithmic scales ; the vector plots show the magnetic field ( ( a ) and ( c ) ) and flow velocity ( ( b ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "the black circle represents the black hole .",
    "figures 1a and 1b present the initial conditions , which are the same as in the 2-d simulations ( koide , shibata , & kudoh 1999 ) . at @xmath44 comparing with fig .",
    "6c ( @xmath45 ) in koide et al .",
    "( 1999 ) the jet is less generated . at @xmath46 the jet is generated as 2-d simulation at the earlier time ( @xmath45 ) . at @xmath47 , the jet is clearly created around @xmath48 , which is shown by the enhanced density ( fig .",
    "1c ) and pressure ( fig .",
    "1d ) . as in the 2-d simulations",
    "the jet is generated in a hollowed cylindrical form .",
    "the magnetic field is twisted by the accretion disk and pinched , which increases the magnetic field pressure and generates the jet near the black hole .",
    "the delay of jet formation seems to be due to reduction of shock formation at @xmath2 caused by the additional freedom in the azimuthal direction .",
    "further investigation will be reported elsewhere .",
    "this simulation result is initial and we will perform more simulations and investigate effects of the third dimension .",
