    "there is a widespread interest in studying ultracold fermi gases to learn about some of the most strongly interacting systems in nature .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the atomic fermi gas near unitarity provides a prototype for the physics of quark - gluon plasmas which are associated with the early stages of the big bang .",
    "most remarkable about these two nominally different physical systems is the fact that they correspond to nearly perfect fluids , exhibiting even in their non - superfluid phases extremely small values of the shear viscosity @xmath2 . in this paper",
    "we call attention to a third class of strongly interacting systems which is the metallic counterpart of the perfect ( neutral ) fluid , namely , the so - called `` bad metal '' @xcite .",
    "we show how low conductivity and low viscosity are analogous .",
    "bad metals are known to exist in nature in a most fascinating class of materials : the high @xmath0 superconductors .",
    "we argue here that to learn more about the physics of nearly perfect fluids it is particularly useful to study the behavior of the conductivity in the cuprate superconductors and vice versa .",
    "we note that it may seem at first sight paradoxical that bad metals and perfect fluids have anything in common since the condensate contribution to the conductivity is infinite in the metallic system whereas the viscosity counterpart in the neutral superfluid is zero .",
    "we stress throughout this paper that the dc transport ( associated with @xmath5 ) in both cases reflects the normal fluid or _ excitations _ of the condensate .    because the ultracold fermi gases near the unitary limit are also thought to be related to quark - gluon plasmas @xcite , much attention has focused on particle - physics - based calculations of the anomalously low shear viscosity , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , considerable insight into the thermodynamics @xcite and various spectroscopic studies @xcite has also been obtained via a condensed matter perspective .",
    "this paper belongs to the second school in which bcs theory is extended to accommodate arbitrarily strong interactions .",
    "we apply bcs to bose einstein condensation ( bec ) crossover theory @xcite to compute @xmath2 in the neutral fermi gases and the conductivity @xmath6 ( evaluated at @xmath5 ) for the charged counterparts , such as the high @xmath0 superconductors .",
    "our results , which are reasonably consistent with experiments , apply both above and below @xmath0 .",
    "essential to this work is demonstrable consistency with central sum rules and conservation laws @xcite .",
    "experimentally this crossover can be straightforwardly observed in the ultracold fermi gases by exploiting feshbach resonances . as has been argued @xcite",
    ", this crossover also appears relevant to the cuprates ( i ) because of their anomalously short coherence length .",
    "added support comes from ( ii ) their anomalously high transition temperatures and ( iii ) the widespread effects of a normal state gap @xcite .",
    "( iv ) the smooth evolution from over to underdoped behavior of the optical conductivity , has similarly been used to argue @xcite that the bcs - bec crossover scenario might be appropriate to the cuprates .",
    "although the cold gases and high @xmath0 cuprates have @xmath4 and @xmath7-wave order parameters respectively , this difference does not significantly modify our treatment of transport .",
    "the shear viscosity , like the dc conductivity , is a powerful probe for testing microscopic theories because it reflects the normal fluid component and is extremely sensitive to the nature of the excitation spectrum .",
    "the low @xmath1 normal fermi liquid phase with scattering lifetime @xmath8 and effective mass @xmath9 helps to set up the general nomenclature . here @xmath10 .",
    "similarly @xmath11 .",
    "more generally , one can think of @xmath2 and @xmath6 as characterized by the effective number of normal excitations ( @xmath12 ) as well as their lifetime which we emphasize here is a many body effect .",
    "crucial is an understanding of how @xmath13 depends on @xmath1 .",
    "our central conclusion is that both the effects of a fermionic gap ( with onset temperature @xmath14 ) and non - condensed pairs act in concert to reduce @xmath13 and thus _ lower _ the shear viscosity and dc conductivity at all @xmath15 .",
    "these non - condensed pairs are associated with the stronger than bcs attraction and are present for @xmath16 .",
    "when quantitatively compared with very recent shear viscosity experiments @xcite ( we independently infer @xcite an estimated lifetime from radio frequency data ) the agreement is reasonable .",
    "we similarly compare the ( @xmath5 ) dc conductivity ( as well as its normal state @xmath17 inverse , @xmath18 , the resistivity ) with the counterparts in the high @xmath0 superconductors and find reasonable agreement with trends in doping and temperature . while condensed matter  simulations \" based on these atomic fermi gases are now of wide interest , our approach here is somewhat different because we focus on condensed matter phenomena which currently exist in nature , for example the pseudogap in the cuprate superconductors .",
    "we have emphasized the commonality for these two systems in past reviews @xcite and more recently @xcite in the context of analogous tools such as radio frequency spectroscopy , which is closely related to photoemission @xcite .",
    "it seems natural then to investigate here the analogies in transport .",
    "our work is organized around a second important premise : any theory of transport or scattering in the superfluid fermi gases ( both above and below @xmath0 ) must be formulated in a fully gauge invariant and sum - rule consistent fashion .",
    "one could imagine doing more and more sophisticated many body theories than standard bcs - related approaches ( i.e. summing more and more diagrams ) but , if sum rules and conservation laws can not be demonstrated to hold , we would argue the significance of these calculations is problematic .",
    "indeed , a major theme of our recent @xcite work which is summarized in this overview is to arrive at a demonstrably consistent theory of this exotic superfluidity by extending the important contributions of nambu @xcite to the case of bcs - bec crossover .",
    "this will serve as a basis for computing gauge invariant and properly conserving response functions which are measured in transport and scattering experiments .",
    "it is not as straightforward to demonstrate this consistency in monte carlo or other numerically - based schemes .",
    "moreover , as theories of bcs - bec crossover become more and more diagrammatically complicated it is not straightforward to determine that they are compatible with gauge invariance and conservation laws .",
    "once this compatibility is established the next step is to assess the physical implications of this consistency in experimental probes .",
    "we stress here that our approach to bcs - bec crossover is semi - analytical and therefore reasonably transparent .",
    "moreover , unlike alternative ( more numerical diagrammatic schemes @xcite ) the normal to superfluid transition is properly smooth and second order .",
    "a systematic treatment of transport in the fermi superfluids requires the introduction @xcite of inter - dependent fermionic as well as bosonic ( or pair ) excitations . in past transport literature",
    "there has been a focus on either one @xcite or the other @xcite , but not both .",
    "here we use a kubo - based formalism which readily accommodates the simultaneous bosonic and fermionic excitations of the normal state and condensate and thereby addresses @xmath13 quite accurately while the alternative boltzmann or kinetic theory - based approaches do not naturally incorporate these multiple statistical effects .",
    "the kubo approach includes scattering processes via the lifetimes @xcite which appear in the various green s functions , while boltzmann schemes treat lifetimes via collision integrals .",
    "however , because the physics of this dissipation is principally associated with the many body processes of boson - fermion inter - conversion ( via a parameter @xmath19 which appears throughout this paper ) , it should be satisfactorily addressed only in theories which treat the mixed statistics .",
    "we stress in this paper that dissipative transport in the normal phase must also be addressed if one is to fully understand the counterpart below @xmath0 case . except in strict bcs theory ,",
    "this normal phase is affected by the below @xmath0 pairing correlations . as a result ,",
    "consistency checks need to be applied above @xmath0 and the behavior must necessarily reflect that the transition is second order . our central theme is based on the fact that the fermionic excitation gap or pairing gap persists above @xmath0 as a  pseudogap \" ( except in strict bcs theory ) ; this leads to important transport implications such as  nearly perfect fluidity \" ( reflecting anomalously small viscosity @xcite ) or in the analogous charged system  bad metal \" @xcite behavior ( reflecting anomalously small conductivity ) .    to add to the case for simultaneously studying both the viscosity and dc conductivity",
    "we note that the wealth of data available @xcite and the relative ease of measurement ( compared to those in atomic or rhic experiments ) make the cuprates a particularly useful analogue for the nearly perfect fluids .",
    "in addition to dc measurements , one can probe @xcite the conductivity as a function of frequency @xmath20 , @xmath21 , over a wide range of @xmath20 .",
    "because of the existence of a frequency sum rule , theories of the ( dc ) conductivity are thereby highly constrained .",
    "importantly , this sum rule and an in depth understanding of the conductivity serve to constrain analogous microscopic theories of viscosity . conventionally , `` bad '' metals are systems in which the estimated mean free path @xmath22 is shorter than all length scales ; along with anomalously low conductivity this leads to the absence of resistivity saturation .",
    "the descriptive `` perfect '' is also associated with a situation in which @xmath22 is small compared to physical length scales @xcite . in strongly correlated superfluids , we re - iterate here that small @xmath22 does not solely reflect short transport lifetimes @xmath23 but rather a notable suppression in the effective `` carrier number '' .",
    "the influence of bad metallicity on superconductivity was studied in ref .  .",
    "here we emphasize the converse : the influence of superconductivity on transport @xcite . moreover , as will be discussed in more detail below , pairing fluctuations and the phase fluctuations invoked earlier @xcite are clearly distinct .",
    "we have included a summary of the main results of this paper in section [ sec:1c ] .",
    "for ease in reading this paper , the reader who is not interested in the technical details can skip sections [ sec:2 ] and [ sec:3 ] and go directly to section [ sec:4 ] .      to understand viscosity in fermionic superfluids , it is useful to begin with helium-3 which has been successfully described using bcs - based approaches , albeit for the @xmath24-wave case @xcite . here experiments @xcite indicate that @xmath2 drops off rapidly to zero in the superfluid phase .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig:1 ] to the left .",
    "interestingly , there is a minimum in @xmath2 _ above _ @xmath0 which is associated with strict fermi liquid behavior @xcite . in a fermi liquid the number of carriers and mass are both @xmath1 independent , while the inter - fermion scattering lifetime varies as @xmath25 .",
    "the standard interpretation of the data below @xmath0 is that @xmath2 decreases with decreasing @xmath1 as a result of the suppression of fermionic excitations at low @xmath1 . in a strong magnetic field",
    "one spin component of the triplet is driven normal and this leads to a very different behavior for the shear viscosity @xcite , in which ( even below @xmath0 ) it reflects the normal fermi liquid behavior above @xmath0 . in this @xmath26 phase ,",
    "the low temperature behavior exhibits an upturn at low @xmath1 ; this is not to be associated with coupling to collective modes or phonons , but rather reflects a residual normal component . in bcs - based superfluids ,",

    "it is inferred @xcite from similar systematic studies that the effective number of carriers at fixed @xmath1 is substantially depressed , varying as the doping @xmath29 rather than the expected @xmath30 .",
    "importantly , for the present purposes @xmath31 seems to approach zero at the lowest temperatures . the latter point is consistent with the vanishing @xmath2 shown in the previous figure for the fermionic superfluid .",
    "the pronounced maximum is thought to arise from the competition between the decrease in @xmath32 and the increase in the fermionic lifetime at low @xmath1 .",
    "such a competition is not nearly as apparent in an @xmath4-wave system where @xmath32 is exponentially suppressed .        in fig .",

    "the bcs - bec crossover theory that is adopted here is based on a natural extension of the bcs ground state , @xmath33 this ground state is often called the `` bcs - leggett '' state . the observation that this state is much more general than originally presumed forms the basis for bcs - bec crossover theory @xcite . to implement this generalization of the bcs ground state ,",
    "all that is required is that one solve for the two variational parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 in concert with a self consistent condition on the fermionic chemical potential @xmath36 .",

    "the two variational parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be converted to two more physically accessible parameters associated with the zero temperature gap ( or equivalently order parameter ) and @xmath36 .",
    "we stress that while in the cuprates the system is far from the bec limit ( in large part because of @xmath7-wave lattice effects @xcite ) , it is nevertheless quite distinct from the weak - coupling bcs limit due to the anomalously short coherence length @xcite .",
    "since this wave function is so closely related to the bcs state , it is natural to ask whether its behavior away from @xmath38 can be consolidated into as simple a formalism and physical picture as there is for the ground state . in section [ sec:2 ]",

    "one of the earliest observations that a pseudogap may be present in bcs - bec crossover theories is due to randeria and co - workers @xcite . this first generation analysis focused on  spin gap \" effects , so that there were a number of claims which are inconsistent with current understanding . despite statements to the contrary @xcite , ( i )",
    "the pseudogap is not a  spin gap \" , but is also to be associated , as we have seen in the present transport calculations , with the  charge channel \" .",
    "this mirrors the experimental observations @xcite on the nature of the cuprate pseudogap :  it is a quasiparticle gap and not just a spin gap . \"",

    "( iii ) the pseudogap in crossover theories is quite distinct from the pseudogap associated with the phase fluctuation scenario ( as discussed in section [ sec:1b1 ] ) .",
    "our group was one of the earliest ( i ) to flesh out an understanding of the nature of this pseudogap , and , in particular to show @xcite that the bcs - bec crossover - pseudogap is not only associated with spin as was claimed @xcite , but that more generally it represents a quasi - particle gap .",
    "this observation was based on calculations of the fermionic spectral function .",
    "( ii ) to address gauge invariant electrodynamics in the presence of a pseudogap @xcite .",
    "( iii ) to introduce the concept of a pseudogap into the cold gas literature @xcite and ( iv ) to introduce @xcite the now widely used expression @xcite for the self energy ( eq .  ( [ eq : selfenergy ] ) ) .",
    "there has been a significant effort devoted to reaching a theoretical understanding of the various viscosities associated with highly correlated fermionic superfluids @xcite .",
    "a detailed overview exploring the relation between cold atomic gases and hot quark gluon plasmas was presented by schaefer and teaney @xcite .",
    "taylor and randeria @xcite established sum rules at unitarity for the dynamical counterpart @xmath261 and @xmath262 , which are less general than those in eqs .",
    "( [ rulechit ] ) and ( [ rulesigma ] ) .",
    "zwerger and colleagues @xcite addressed the behavior of the normal unitary gas predicting a minimum in @xmath3 near the superfluid transition .",
    "bruun and smith @xcite were , perhaps , the first to emphasize the importance of the ( static ) shear viscosity in cold fermi gases using both a high temperature fermionic boltzmann approach and a kubo - stress tensor based scheme ( above @xmath0 ) , within bcs - bec theory .",
    "they importantly recognized @xcite that the introduction of a pseudogap would lower the normal state @xmath2 .",
    "however , the diagram set which was used was `` not conserving''@xcite .",
    "rupak and schafer @xcite introduced an alternative ( bosonic boltzmann ) transport theory in which the low @xmath263 shear viscosity is dominated by the goldstone bosons or phonons .",
    "they predicted that @xmath3 , increases as temperature decreases . in their approach phonons",
    "dominate the low @xmath1 transport , presumably leading to the same upturn in @xmath2 , as is seen in helium-4 , and shown in figure [ fig:1 ] , on the right . establishing diagrammatic consistency",
    "is a central theme of this paper and within a bcs - like theory the shear viscosity , as a transverse response , does not directly couple @xcite to the nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "this is to be distinguished from the longitudinal current - current correlations which are the basis for the bulk viscosity and necessarily depend on these collective modes .",
    "understanding the temperature dependence of the ( inverse ) conductivity or dc resistivity , particularly near optimal doping , was one of the first puzzles posed by the high temperature superconductors .",
    "it should , nevertheless be noted that a number of ideas and interpretations about transport were established well before there was a full understanding of how widespread was the pseudogap phase ( which extends over most of the phase diagram , including optimal doping ) .",
    "for this reason , one can argue that these earlier theories must be reexamined .",
    "a number of different models from spin - charge separation @xcite to marginal fermi liquid phenomenology @xcite were invoked to explain ( i ) the unusual normal state temperature power laws observed , _",
    "e.g. , _ the linear resistivity . a second notable observation ( ii )",
    "was that the effective carrier number in transport appeared to scale with the number of ( extra ) doped holes @xcite , called @xmath29 , even though the volume of the fermi surface scaled as expected with @xmath30 .",
    "the first of these experimental observations gave rise to the concept of a distinct  strange metal \" phase which was thought to separate the overdoped and underdoped regimes .",
    "the second of these gave rise to the concept of  spin - charge \" separation . despite the widespread agreement that the normal state of the cuprates was a non - fermi liquid phase",
    ", there is today a strong belief that the superconducting phase is fermi liquid based @xcite .",
    "it must be noted that the bcs - bec crossover scenario addresses these issues from a very different perspective .",
    "it presumes that there is a smooth evolution , as seen experimentally @xcite from over to underdoped behavior rather than a distinct strange metal phase near optimal doping .",
    "we have argued here that the suppression in the number of carriers may be associated with the fact that the magnitude of the excitation gap grows with underdoping .",
    "[ in the ac conductivity , this leads to a very small weight for the @xmath264 drude peak , which requires by the sum rule , an additional mid - infrared contribution , now widely observed experimentally @xcite . ]",
    "as noted above , there is no spin - charge separation in the normal phase .",
    "importantly , the superconducting phase has bosonic excitations representing non - condensed pairs ( also present above @xmath0 ) and therefore this phase is not fermi liquid based .",
    "finally , the dissipation mechanism here associated with the bcs - bec crossover scenario arises from the inter - conversion of fermions and pairs , which is distinctly tied to the pseudogap .",
    "this is to be distinguished from most transport theories @xcite which focus on impurity effects or the dynamics of the pairing boson .",
    "there is a shortcoming in our cuprate transport calculations because we have ignored impurity effects in transport altogether .",
    "away from very low @xmath1 , it is generally accepted @xcite that they are not particularly important .",
    "nevertheless , they may lead to incomplete condensation @xcite in the ground state .",
    "indeed , it is difficult to see how to reconcile claims @xcite that the @xmath38 superfluid density scales as @xmath265 , with the transverse f - sum rule ( eq .  [ rulesigma ] ) ) , without invoking incomplete condensation in the ground state . a deeper understanding of a possibly more inhomogeneous treatment of impurities is needed .",
    "fortunately , this is not an issue in the cold gases .    with a growing appreciation for the nature of the pseudogap ( and related  fermi arc \" effects ) ,",
    "experimentalists have provided some support to our findings . from ref .",
    "it is said that  this indicates that the functional form of the dc resistivity of cuprates @xmath266 is governed not only by the relaxation processes but also by temperature - dependent numbers of carriers \" .",
    "moreover , in ref . it is stated that  one may notice that a natural extension of the present argument would be that the t - linear resistivity usually observed near optimum doping may not necessarily by a sign of a t - linear relaxation rate , because @xmath32 may be changing with t. \" .",
    "an interesting corollary to a carrier number which necessary increases with @xmath1 , is that the inverse lifetime @xmath19 should contain higher powers than linear ( we use the most conventional , fermi liquid dependence @xmath267 ) to arrive at metallic behavior for the conductivity .",
    "in summary , this paper has addressed the role of the pseudogap in the @xmath5 conductivity and in the shear viscosity both above and below @xmath0 .",
    "we have emphasized the analogy between  bad metals \" @xcite and  perfect fluids \" @xcite seen in high @xmath0 superconductors and the atomic fermi gases . both of these phenomena , we argue , may arise from pseudogap effects .",
    "our approach builds on a consistent gauge invariant treatment of transport ( which has not been addressed previously ) , in which the transverse f- sum rule demonstrably holds . in this paper",
    "we have demonstrated success in simultaneously addressing experiments in cold gases and high @xmath0 cuprates within the same transport formalism . as a summary ,",
    "figure [ fig:13 ] gives a reasonable understanding of the experiments shown in figures [ fig:2 ] and [ fig:3 ] .",
    "equally important , figure [ fig:12 ] shows semi - quantitative agreement with shear viscosity data from below to above @xmath0 .",
    "we see no sign of the upturn which others have predicted .",
    "it was our intention in this overview to introduce some of the key challenges in understanding transport in the high @xmath0 superconductors to the wider readership interested in perfect fluidity .",
