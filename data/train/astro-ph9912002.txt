    "due to their high density , cores of globular clusters serve as excellent laboratories for studying stellar interactions and the resulting changes in stellar populations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , a small fraction of clusters known as post core collapse ( pcc ) clusters are characterized by extremely high central densities and tend to have color gradients in the sense of becoming bluer inward .",
    "though several authors have shown that central depletion of bright red giant branch ( rgb ) stars is an important contributor to the color gradient in these clusters ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter gwysb ) , a satisfactory explanation of the underlying physical cause of this rgb depletion has proven elusive ( @xcite ) .",
    "most globular clusters are well fit by king models ( kms ; @xcite ) and very few of these show any such color gradient .",
    "even the km clusters that are suspected to have a color gradient ( e.g. , ngc  4147 ) are all quite centrally concentrated so that the distinction between km and pcc clusters is unclear in these cases ( @xcite , 1993 ) .",
    "m30 is a prototypical pcc cluster , with one of the best - studied color gradients of all globular clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; piotto et  al .",
    "1988 ; @xcite ; gwysb ) .",
    "this gradient has traditionally been explained by a deficiency of red giants and asymptotic giant branch stars near the cluster center , but burgarella  & buat ( 1996 ) found that this central deficiency does not account for the observed color gradient , and gwysb have independently suggested that the central evolved star deficit only produces one third of the observed color gradient in m30 , and all evolved stellar populations put together produce less than half of the observed gradient .",
    "a possible explanation for the rest of the color gradient is mass segregation of main sequence stars , since stars near the main sequence turnoff , with higher mass and bluer color , are expected to be more centrally concentrated than the fainter , redder , and less massive stars .",
    "this paper reexamines the radial color profile of m30 s starlight using _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) wide field planetary camera  2 ( wfpc2 ) images and wider field ground - based images , tests methods for redistributing the light of bright stars , and addresses the question of whether main sequence mass segregation produces the necessary color gradient to explain the observations . observations of m30 s color gradient and methods for uniformly redistributing the light of bright evolved stars are described in  2 .",
    "calculations of the effects of main sequence mass segregation are presented in  3 , and  4 contains a summary of the main points of the paper .",
    "in order to study the color of the cluster starlight , it is necessary to determine and correct for the `` background '' level in the _ hst_/wfpc2 images .",
    "the term `` background '' includes all non - cluster contributions to the total light , including foreground zodiacal light , extragalactic background light , and even non - astrophysical artifacts such as low level residual cosmic rays and hot pixels .",
    "gwysb estimated this background to be 0.094  adu  pixel@xmath4 in f439w and 0.054  adu  pixel@xmath4 in f555w based on visually selected regions of the image more than @xmath12 from the cluster center and away from resolved stars .",
    "this technique could be biased in either direction : the background would be overestimated if unresolved cluster starlight contributes significantly to the background over the entire image , or underestimated if atypically dark regions were selected that systematically avoid , for example , hot pixels , residual cosmic rays , and/or background galaxies .",
    "this paper uses a combination of _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 data and short ground - based @xmath9- and @xmath10-band ccd exposures of m30 provided by mike bolte ( see @xcite ; @xcite for details ) to determine the background brightness in the wfpc2 images , in contrast to the method used by gwysb .",
    "the ground - based images are used only for background estimation and not for stellar photometry .",
    "they cover a sufficiently large field of view that unresolved cluster light is unlikely to affect measurements of the background in the far corners of the ccd frames .",
    "the background in these images includes a dominant atmospheric airglow component in addition to the sources listed above .",
    "the mean @xmath9- and @xmath10-band background brightnesses are measured in selected regions of these images located at projected distances of @xmath13@xmath14 and @xmath15@xmath16 , respectively , from the cluster center ; these background estimates are then subtracted from the images .",
    "note , the ground - based @xmath9 data consist of two images , a core pointing covering most of the wfpc2 field of view , and a southwest pointing which overlaps the core pointing but not the wfpc2 field . since the core image extends only to @xmath17 , the southwest image is used for background estimation .",
    "this background estimate is bootstrapped to the core image using a difference @xmath18 ; the mean value of regions selected from this area , avoiding obvious residual artifacts , is used as the background value for the core image .",
    "the @xmath10-band background measurement is more straightforward and is based on a single ccd image .",
    "the regions used to measure the mean non - cluster background flux in the southwest @xmath9 and @xmath10 images are selected to be away from all resolved stars ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) as these are likely to be cluster members according to the @xcite galactic star count model ( see discussion at the end of this section ) .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath10 background estimates show no trend with angular separation from the nearest bright star or from the cluster center , indicating that the measurements are unaffected by scattered light from bright stars or unresolved faint stars in m30 .",
    "hst_/wfpc2 pc1 and wf2wf4 images are combined into a mosaic image in each of the f439w and f555w bands ( gwysb ) .",
    "these mosaic images are rotated , rebinned , and gaussian smoothed to match the orientation and resolution of the corresponding ground - based images ( @xmath9 : @xmath21  pixel@xmath4 , @xmath22 ; @xmath10 : @xmath23  pixel@xmath4 , @xmath24 ) .",
    "the background - subtracted ground - based images are then masked to preserve only the region of overlap with the wfpc2 mosaic , taking care to mask out the edges of both images where the smoothing of the latter is imperfect .",
    "the ground - based @xmath10 image covers all of the wfpc2 f555w image , while the @xmath9 image covers about 93% of the wfpc2 f439w image , excluding only a small corner section of wf2 at @xmath25 from the cluster center .",
    "the resulting _ hst _ images differ from the corresponding ground - based images only in terms of a photometric scale factor and the background flux in the wfpc2 images .",
    "the wfpc2 background flux in each band is obtained in two different ways .",
    "the first method involves a linear least squares fit to solve simultaneously for the photometric scale factor and wfpc2 background flux level by doing a pixel - to - pixel comparison of the @xmath26@xmath27  pixels in each pair of matched wfpc2 and ground - based images . because of its high stellar surface density , coupled with inaccuracies in the psf match ,",
    "the pc1 ccd is not used in this comparison .",
    "the wfpc2 background flux is estimated to be 0.0083  adu in f439w and 0.092  adu in f555w per @xmath28 mosaic image pixel . unless otherwise mentioned , these least - squares - fit ",
    "based wfpc2 background values are adopted for the rest of the paper . in the second , more direct , method of background determination",
    ", the photometric scale factor is estimated using aperture photometry on a selection of bright stars which are known to be isolated on the original , high - resolution _ hst _ images . after applying this multiplicative photometric correction to the ground - based image , a difference image ( wfpc2 minus ground - based )",
    "is constructed whose mean value should be equal to the wfpc2 background flux . in practice , point spread function ( psf ) matching and star subtraction are not perfect , so it is necessary to estimate the mean background level in regions away from bright star residuals .",
    "a comparison of the two background estimates and errors in the background flux determination are discussed in  2.2 and  2.3 .",
    "the adopted wfpc2 background levels correspond to sky brightnesses of @xmath29  mag  arcsec@xmath30 and @xmath31  mag  arcsec@xmath30 , but it should be noted that these background brightness levels may be partly instrumental in origin ",
    "the space telescope science institute pipeline bias subtraction may have been inaccurate seeing as the data were obtained only a few months after the installation of the wfpc2 instrument .",
    "spatial variations in sky brightness due to individual galactic field stars are expected to be unimportant .",
    "for example , the @xcite galactic star count model prediction in this part of the sky is less than 1  star  arcmin@xmath30 with @xmath32 at the bright end of the stellar distribution , which corresponds to a brightness level of @xmath33  mag  arcsec@xmath30 . since galactic stars tend to outnumber distant field galaxies for @xmath34 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the effect of stochastic variations in the bright end of the field galaxy population is likely to be even smaller .",
    "this study adopts the eight  radial bins defined in gwysb for the purpose of studying m30 s @xmath35 color profile .",
    "the radial bins are chosen such that each contains approximately the same number of evolved stars with @xmath36 , a sample dominated in number by faint rgb stars .",
    "these bins are : ( 1 )  @xmath37 , ( 2 )  @xmath38 , ( 3 )  @xmath39 , ( 4 )  @xmath40 , ( 5 )  @xmath41 , ( 6 )  @xmath42 , ( 7 )  @xmath43 , and ( 8)  @xmath44 . the characteristic radius adopted for each of these bins , for the purpose of comparison with model predictions , is the median radial distance of the stars in that bin ( table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "as described in gwysb , the total @xmath9 and @xmath10 flux within each radial bin is derived from direct aperture photometry on the background - subtracted wfpc2 f439w and f555w mosaic images , respectively , by differencing successive concentric circular apertures .",
    "the contribution of specific stellar populations , on the other hand , is determined by summing over the list of detected stars for which photometry has been carried out using standard techniques ( psf fitting , aperture photometry ) .",
    "only bright rgb and horizontal branch ( hb ) stars are analyzed in this manner for the purpose of uniform redistribution (  2.3 ) .",
    "detailed image simulations indicate that the detection rate for these bright stars is practically 100% ( @xcite ; @xcite ) so that it is not necessary to apply any radially - dependent incompleteness correction .",
    "the mean @xmath35 color of m30 within each radial bin ( annulus ) is plotted in the top panel of figure  [ cgrad ] ( long dashed line with bold triangles ) .",
    "monte carlo realizations , based on a synthetic @xmath10-band luminosity function and @xmath35 color distribution to mimic the properties of m30 s stellar distribution , show that poisson fluctuations in the bright rgb and hb population result in a random error of @xmath45  mag for each radial bin .",
    "there is a significant radial gradient of about @xmath46  mag from the cluster center out to @xmath47 , followed by an abrupt change of about @xmath48  mag from @xmath49 to @xmath50 .",
    "specifically , a least squares fit of a straight line to the @xmath35 vs log(@xmath51 ) profile results in a best - fit slope of @xmath52 using all eight radial bins , and @xmath53 using only radial bins  17 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "these measurements are in keeping with earlier observations of m30 s central blueing trend ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; piotto et  al .",
    "1988 ; @xcite ) .",
    "note , the revised wfpc2 background flux estimates (  2.1 ) result in a color profile that is somewhat different from that published by gwysb using the same data set , especially for @xmath55 .",
    "the open circles and horizontal bars show the ground - based color measurements presented by peterson ( 1986 ) .",
    "peterson s measurements in concentric circular apertures are converted to colors in annuli by differencing successive apertures ; note , these measurements are drawn from complete annuli , while the wfpc2 image geometry forces radial bins to have incomplete azimuthal coverage beyond @xmath56 . nevertheless , our _ hst_-based and peterson s ground - based measurements of the color profile are in good agreement .",
    "the slight overall difference in @xmath35 color ( @xmath57  mag in the mean ) between the two data sets could be the result of systematic differences in photometric calibration .",
    "the effect of the errors in background flux measurements on the final color profile is calculated in two ways :    * the formal error estimate is derived from the least squares fit to the matched wfpc2 and ground - based pixels in the wf ccds only : the error in the mean background flux over this area is transformed to the error per wfpc2 mosaic pixel by multiplying by @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the number of mosaic pixels in the area of the fit ( 3wf ) . in the photometric scale of the wfpc2 data set , the formal errors are 3.1  adu in f439w and 2.0  adu in f555w per mosaic pixel .",
    "the effect of wfpc2 background error on each radial bin is then computed by scaling the pixel - to - pixel error by the square root of the number of mosaic pixels in that radial bin .",
    "* the conservative error estimate is obtained by performing an independent least squares analysis on each of the three wf ccds .",
    "the variation in the mean background flux amongst the three wf ccds is substantially larger than the formal error in the mean given by the fitting routine .",
    "this variation is likely a result of systematic errors arising from psf mismatch and/or bias subtraction differences from ccd to ccd .",
    "radial bin  7 has an area comparable to that of a single wf ccd , so a conservative error for bin  7 is derived from the spread of mean background values amongst the three wf ccds : the spread in the mean is scaled by the number of pixels in each fit ( the number of matched pixels in each wf ccd ) to convert the error in the mean to an error in the sum , and multiplied by the square root of the ratio of the area of bin  7 to that of a wf ccd , @xmath60 .",
    "the background errors for the other radial bins ( @xmath61 ) are estimated in similar fashion by multiplying by @xmath62 .",
    "the conservative error estimate for radial bin  7 is ( practically ) free of the assumption that the error in the background flux scales as the square root of the area since @xmath63 .",
    "this area ratio factor departs most strongly from unity for the innermost bins , but then the background flux ( and the error in the background ) is a negligible fraction of the total flux in these bins .    the error in the measurement of the background level in the ground - based images is determined from the variance amongst mean values in different blank regions .",
    "the variance is scaled to the area of each radial bin and is added in quadrature to the wfpc2 background error ( formal and conservative ) for that bin .",
    "note , the uncertainty in the background level of the ground - based images is generally unimportant in relation to the uncertainty in the wfpc2 background ; the ground - based background error is only 20% of the overall error in the case of the formal @xmath9 band error and even less in the other cases .",
    "the net @xmath9- and @xmath10- band background errors are combined in order to assess the effect on the color profile of m30 s starlight ; the @xmath64 conservative error in the background is shown by the solid lines in the top panel of figure  [ cgrad ] .",
    "the formal error is about an order of magnitude smaller than the conservative error ; these estimates probably represent lower and upper bounds , respectively , on the true error . in assuming @xmath65 scaling of the summed background flux ,",
    "the formal error estimate ignores systematic errors such as psf mismatch and possible ccd - to - ccd differences in residual bias level .",
    "the conservative error estimate , on the other hand , is derived from a comparison of the three  wf ccds which are known _ a priori _ to have different stellar densities and hence different degrees of systematic error caused by psf mismatch of bright stars .",
    "the direct measurement of the background in bright - star  free regions agrees with the background value derived from the least squares fit to the full area of the three wf ccds to well within the conservative error (  2.1 ) .",
    "m30 s nucleus has been shown to be deficient in the most luminous rgb stars .",
    "the ratio of the surface density of bright rgb stars to the cluster surface brightness ( piotto et  al .",
    "1988 ) or to the surface density of faint rgb / subgiant stars ( gwysb ) is significantly lower in the central @xmath66 than further out in the cluster .",
    "the central four radial bins ( @xmath67 ) contain only 23  bright rgb stars , less than 40% of the expected number ( 60 ) .",
    "the expected bright rgb number is derived from the observed number in radial bins  58 ( @xmath68 ) which are unaffected by the central deficiency of these stars , normalizing to the faint rgb population ; a comparable bright rgb fraction is estimated from peterson s ( 1986 ) ground - based data in the @xmath49@xmath69 region of the cluster .",
    "similarly , the net bright rgb flux in the inner four radial bins is 40.9% of the flux in radial bins  58 .",
    "is the central deficiency of bright rgb stars entirely responsible for m30 s bluer - inward color gradient ?",
    "the light from bright rgb stars must be redistributed in some _ uniform _ way in order to determine how much of the observed color gradient is due to this central bright rgb depletion .    in gwysb",
    ", bright rgb flux was redistributed following the radial dependence of the total @xmath70 flux , with the relative normalization between the two  bands chosen such that faint rgb stars ( with the same color as the average cluster color ) contribute equally in @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the result is the dotted curve in the middle panel of figure  [ cgrad ] ; we refer to this as method  a. while this traditional method of bright rgb redistribution algorithm is convenient to implement , it is obviously inaccurate . in the limiting case where the population being redistributed has a negligible contribution to the overall cluster light , method  a produces uniform redistribution . in general , however , the stellar population of interest accounts for a finite fraction of the total light , so that the redistributed color profile contains a `` ghost '' of the original color profile .",
    "this is due to the fact that the normalizing function for redistribution  the integrated cluster light profile  is itself influenced to some degree by the original radial distribution of the stars being redistributed . specifically , redistributing the bright rgb stars in m30 by method  a results in a larger residual bluer - inward color gradient than the more accurate methods defined below ( fig .",
    "[ cgrad ] ) , because bright rgb stars contribute 30%50% of the total cluster light .",
    "a more reasonable scheme might be to redistribute the bright rgb light in proportion to the faint rgb stars .",
    "for example , this may be achieved by assigning one eighth of the total bright rgb flux to each radial bin ( dot - dashed curve in middle panel of fig .",
    "[ cgrad ] ; method  b ) , since the radial bins were defined to contain approximately equal numbers of faint rgb stars .",
    "note , however , that the total bright rgb flux in the wfpc2 image of m30 is lower than it would have been in the absence of the central bright rgb depletion . making the assumption that the relative abundance of the bright rgb population is ` normal ' beyond @xmath71 in m30 , the preferred method of redistribution is to assign one fourth of the bright rgb flux summed over radial bins  58 to each of the 8  radial bins , again roughly in constant proportion to faint rgb stars ( method  c ; short dashed line and solid circles in middle and bottom panels of fig .  [ cgrad ] ) .",
    "unlike the other redistribution methods , method  c actually adds in extra bright rgb flux to compensate for the central bright rgb deficiency in the cluster .",
    "if there is no residual color gradient , this simply has the the effect of producing a redward color offset with respect to the method  b profile .",
    "however , if a residual color gradient is present , method  c produces both a shallower color gradient and redder overall colors than method  b because of dilution by the extra bright rgb light .",
    "the two new bright rgb redistribution methods used in this paper , methods  b and c , are coupled with redistribution of the flux of hb stars : each radial bin is assigned one eighth of the total hb flux , thereby correcting for poisson noise in the distribution of hb stars and forcing the hb to faint rgb flux ratio to be constant .",
    "table  [ table1 ] summarizes the redistribution methods described above and lists both the formal and conservative error estimates .",
    "the solid lines in the bottom panel of figure  [ cgrad ] show the effect of @xmath64 conservative background errors on the method  c residual profile .",
    "-2.0truein    [ table1 ]    the motivation for these redistribution schemes is that mass segregation is _ not _ expected to produce radial gradients in either the bright to faint rgb ratio or the hb to faint rgb ratio , as the characteristic masses of faint and bright rgb stars differ by only @xmath72 ( @xcite ) , and the typical masses of hb stars are thought to be within @xmath73 that of faint rgb stars ( @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "the dynamical timescale for mass segregation is about a factor of  4 longer than the lifetime in the hb evolutionary phase ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "redistribution of both bright rgb and hb flux results in a residual color profile that is consistent with no residual color gradient , and quite smooth compared to the observed color profile ( fig .",
    "[ cgrad ] ) .",
    "the jagged nature of the original color gradient results from relatively small numbers of bright rgb and hb stars dominating the light at any given radius .",
    "the smoothness of the residual , redistributed color profile indicates that the photometry and subtraction of these bright evolved stars must be accurate .",
    "the slight kink in radial bin  3 may be due to oversubtraction at the level of 12% .",
    "a @xmath74 test shows that a constant color ( no gradient ) is an adequate fit to the method  c residual color profile , and no significant slope is found .",
    "the fraction of @xmath9- and @xmath10-band light from evolved stars , defined to be those with @xmath75 ( bright / faint rgb , hb , subgiants , blue stragglers ) , is measured in each radial bin after uniform redistribution of bright rgb and hb stars using method  c. these fractions , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , are shown in figure  [ fev ] ( bold and open squares ) and listed in table  [ table2 ] . evolved stars contribute about three quarters of the total flux at small radii in both bands and their flux fraction falls off with increasing radius to about  0.6 at @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath76 fractions are needed for appropriate normalization of the models in  3.3 ; the observed @xmath76 and @xmath77 values are also compared to fractions derived from the bergbusch  & vandenberg ( 1992 ) theoretical luminosity function (  3.4 ) .",
    "although @xmath78 is calculated after evolved star redistribution , these values will be referred to as `` observed '' @xmath78 values for the rest of this paper .",
    "a fokker - planck ( fp ) dynamical model ( @xcite ) designed specifically for the cluster m15 , constrained by its measured velocity dispersion , surface brightness profile , and millisecond pulsar acceleration , is used in this paper .",
    "no fp model has been designed for m30 , so the m15 model is adapted to m30 by applying a small adjustment to its radial scale ( b.  w.  murphy 1998 , private communication ) .",
    "additional procedures used to tailor the model to m30 are described in  3.3 .",
    "there are important differences between the physical parameters of m15 and m30 some of which may even be relevant to the central depletion of bright red giants ",
    ",  m15 s central velocity dispersion and central density are about twice the corresponding m30 values ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "3.33.4 .",
    "the fp model specifies the number of stars in each of twenty stellar mass bins as a function of radius .",
    "the first five mass bins represent nonluminous stellar remnants ( neutron stars and white dwarfs of various masses ) which are irrelevant for the color gradient computation .",
    "the next two mass bins correspond to hb and rgb stars , respectively , and the last thirteen mass bins cover main sequence stars of successively lower mass in the range 0.74@xmath79@xmath80 .",
    "the model mass functions are not strictly monotonic with stellar mass at all radii , though they display a general increase in number of stars towards smaller stellar mass , more so at large radii than at small radii .    as an alternative to the fp dynamical model , a multimass km is also considered .",

    "this yields the predicted @xmath35 color of m30 as a function of radius ( `` fp '' entry in table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "-2.0truein    [ table2 ]    the above technique is repeated for the multimass km , using power law stellar mass functions whose slope @xmath84 increases with radius (  3.1 ) .",
    "the calculation is performed using both sets of evolutionary tracks to attach a @xmath10-band luminosity and @xmath35 color to stars of a given mass and the results are listed in table  [ table2 ] : `` km  bv1 '' ( bergbusch  & vandenberg 1992 ) and `` km ",
    "da1 '' ( dantona ) .",
    "as described above , the @xmath76 normalization constraint ( ratio of evolved stars to main sequence stars ) is applied at each radius ; hb stars are normalized to the rgb population overall , and the radial dependence of the hb to rgb ratio is adopted from the fp model .    to be consistent with the redistribution of hb stars in m30 and following the reasoning given in  2.3 ,",
    "calculations are also carried out in which the ratio of model hb to rgb flux is forced to be constant with radius and equal to the ratio measured in m30 ( after bright rgb and hb redistribution ) .",
    "the calculations are otherwise identical to the `` km  bv1 '' and `` km ",
    "da1 '' calculations described above .",
    "the constant hb - to - rgb results are labeled `` km  bv2 '' and `` km ",
    "da2 '' in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "the effect of relaxing the @xmath76 normalization constraint is also explored .",
    "this is done via direct integration of the luminosity functions tabulated by bergbusch  & vandenberg ( 1992 ) for mass function slopes in the range @xmath108 to + 2.5 .",
    "the mass functions must be extrapolated to obtain the negative slopes , @xmath109 , appropriate for m30 s central regions (  3.1 ) .",
    "the bergbusch  & vandenberg model isochrones do not include the hb phase of stellar evolution .",
    "as in the `` km  bv2 '' calculation , hb flux is added in constant proportion to rgb stars at all radii .",
    "the resulting @xmath35 color gradient is labeled `` km  bv3 '' in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "note , the @xmath110 values for the bergbusch  & vandenberg isochrone , with hb stars added in , tend to be higher than the observed values in m30 for @xmath111 ( with bright rgb and hb stars redistributed ) : the discrepancy is about 10% at @xmath112 ( table  [ table2 ] ; fig .",
    "[ fev ] ) .    comparing the results of the six calculations described above ( table  [ table2 ] ) , it is clear that choice of dynamical model has little effect on the color profile : `` fp '' and `` km ",
    "bv1 '' model colors differ by less than @xmath113  mag at all radii . the bluer lower main sequence in the dantona isochrone relative to the bergbusch  & vandenberg ( 1992 ) isochrone (  3.2 ) results in slightly bluer overall colors , though the color gradient is nearly the same ( `` km ",
    "bv1 '' vs `` km  da1 '' and `` km ",
    "bv2 '' vs `` km  da2 '' ) .",
    "lower main sequence stars produce a larger fraction of the total light at large radii than at small radii , and this results in a slightly greater difference in color between dantona and bergbusch  & vandenberg calculations at large radii . comparing the `` km  bv1 '' results to `` km  bv2 '' and `` km ",
    "da1 '' to `` km  da2 '' shows that the increase in hb / rgb ratio with increasing radius in the former set of calculations is responsible for the overall bluer colors at large radii ; the constant hb / rgb ratio in the latter set of calculations yields a marginally redder - outward gradient . unlike the other calculations , the `` km  bv3 '' case avoids empirical normalization of the evolved - to - main sequence flux ratio .",
    "thus , `` km  bv3 '' has a higher evolved star fraction than the other cases since the bergbusch  & vandenberg @xmath110 values are generally higher than the observed @xmath76 values ; this results in slightly bluer overall colors due to the increased prominence of evolved stars , most notably bright blue hb stars .",
    "a back - of - the - envelope calculation based on the `` km  bv3 '' model illustrates why main sequence mass segregation can make no appreciable contribution to m30 s overall color gradient .",
    "the mean cluster color of about @xmath114 , which also happens to be the mean color of faint rgb stars , is a reasonable value at which to separate the main sequence into an upper and lower main sequence ( ums and lms , respectively ) . integrating the lms , ums , and evolved star portions of the isochrone shows that the relative numbers of stars are : @xmath115 in radial bin  2 ; and @xmath116 in radial bin  7",
    ". evolved stars contribute about 70% of the total light in radial bin  2 , and 55% in radial bin  7 . the typical evolved star ( rgb / hb )",
    "is @xmath117 more luminous in @xmath10 and @xmath118  mag redder in @xmath35 than typical ums stars , and @xmath119 more luminous and @xmath118  mag bluer than lms stars .",
    "thus , the color shift relative to the faint rgb due to ums stars is the product of their fractional flux contribution ( @xmath120 ) and the color difference ( @xmath121  mag ) : @xmath122  mag in radial bin  2 , and @xmath123  mag in radial bin  7 .",
    "similar calculations for the lms yield shifts in @xmath124 of @xmath125  mag and @xmath126  mag , respectively .",
    "the estimated net color gradient due to main sequence mass segregation from this admittedly oversimplified calculation is @xmath127  mag redder outward , well within the range of @xmath128  mag to @xmath129  mag yielded by more precise calculations , and equal to the value of @xmath125  mag from the most closely related such calculation , `` km  bv3 '' ( table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "the calculation involving direct integration of the bergbusch  & vandenberg ( 1992 ) stellar mass and luminosity functions , `` km  bv3 '' , predicts a larger fraction of evolved star light for @xmath111 than the @xmath78 values observed in m30 (  2.3 ) . put another way ,",
    "a higher fraction of main sequence light is observed than predicted , especially as one moves away from the cluster center .",
    "this discrepancy is similar in @xmath9 and @xmath10 . to resolve the discrepancy in the context of power law mass functions ( as the multimass kms",
    "are parameterized above ) , the exponent must vary with radius from @xmath130 in the innermost radial bin ( @xmath86 ) to @xmath108 around @xmath131 to @xmath132 in the outermost radial bin ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "however , the stellar mass function is not necessarily a power law and there may be alternate ways of resolving the @xmath78 discrepancy .",
    "also , the true discrepancy is nearly 30% greater than figure  [ fev ] indicates : the `` km  bv3 '' calculation does not take into account m30 s 30% higher ratio of rgb to turnoff stars relative to model isochrones ( @xcite ; gwysb ) .",
    "as described in  3.1 , the mass function slopes used for the km calculations in this paper are derived from mass function measurements at @xmath133 in m30 ( bolte 1989 ) .",
    "this model - based inward extrapolation is sensitive to the choice of cluster core radius .",
    "recent high resolution studies of the central region have shown that the effective cluster core radius is significantly smaller than bolte s assumed value of @xmath134 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this would imply a somewhat stronger radial dependence of the mass function slope @xmath84 over the @xmath135 region than we have adopted .",
    "bv3 calculations are repeated using values of @xmath130 in the first radial bin to @xmath108 in the outermost radial bin , where this range of @xmath84 values is obtained by a simple linear extrapolation of bolte s data points . as the models of pryor et  al .",
    "( 1986 ) flatten out at @xmath109 at small radii , this linear extrapolation is an unrealistically extreme case .",
    "the resulting color gradient is @xmath136 mag bluer outward , and , like the other calculations , is consistent with the m30 s residual color profile .",
    "the more extreme mass segregation invoked to explain the discrepancy between predicted and observed @xmath78 values ( @xmath130 to + 1.5 ; see previous paragraph ) likewise has little net effect on the color gradient .",
    "the fractional degree of contamination by faint red foreground field stars is expected to increase radially outward ",
    ",  the area of radial bin  1 is 79  arcsec@xmath137 while that of radial bin  8 is 8440  arcsec@xmath137 , even though both bins contain roughly the same number of cluster giants .",
    "however , the density of m30 stars is so high in the central region of the cluster covered by the wfpc2 image that field star contamination should be negligible even in radial bin  8 .",
    "the number of field stars predicted by the galactic star count model of @xcite is too low by several orders of magnitude to have a significant effect on m30 s color profile .",
    "the radial @xmath35 color profile of the post core collapse cluster m30 is measured using _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "wide field planetary camera  2 images , along with ground - based images whose wider field of view allows for a reliable determination of the non - cluster background in the wfpc2 image .",
    "m30 displays a significant radial color gradient of @xmath0  mag , corresponding to a slope of @xmath3  mag  dex@xmath4 from @xmath138@xmath139 .",
    "an accurate new technique is developed for uniform redistribution of the light of the brightest cluster stars , which compensates for stochasticity in their spatial distribution and for the central depletion of bright red giants .",
    "there is no significant residual color gradient after bright star redistribution , implying that post ",
    "main - sequence stars are entirely responsible for the central color gradient in m30 .",
    "this is contrary to the recent results of gwysb and burgarella & buat ( 1996 ) , but confirms the earlier finding of piotto et  al .",
    "( 1988 ) .",
    "the physical mechanism responsible for the central depletion of bright red giants ( and hence the color gradient ) in m30 and in other post  core - collapse clusters remains a mystery .",
    "direct stellar collisions are too infrequent to destroy an appreciable fraction of the giants within their short lifetimes .",
    "the lack of a comparable central depletion amongst horizontal branch stars , the downstream evolutionary products of bright red giants , suggests a ` short circuiting ' of the bright red giant phase rather than complete destruction of such stars ; this may bear some relation to the evolution of giants in binary systems .",
    "the reader is referered to @xcite and gwysb and to references therein for a detailed discussion of these issues .",
    "this study also investigates the effect on the color profile of mass segregation of main sequence stars in the context of cluster dynamical models and theoretical stellar isochrones .",
    "the model calculations show a slight bluer - outward color gradient when the hb varies as predicted by the fokker - planck dynamical model [ @xmath5 from @xmath7@xmath8 ] , and an even smaller redder - outward gradient if the hb is held constant with respect to the rgb . in all cases ,",
    "the color gradient predicted by mass segregation models is consistent with the data to within the measurement uncertainties .",
    "the predicted fraction of light from evolved stars using the theoretical mass and luminosity functions of bergbusch  & vandenberg ( 1992 ) suggests that there is a 10%30% achromatic excess of faint star light at large radii in m30 relative to conventional mass segregation models .",
