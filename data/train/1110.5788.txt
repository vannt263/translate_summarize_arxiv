    "since the discovery of bose - einstein condensates @xcite the knowledge of ultracold atomic and molecular systems has grown with a breathtaking speed .",
    "experimentally , one can extensively control the external motion of the atoms by designing and switching between almost arbitrarily shaped traps @xcite and the strength of the interaction among the atoms can be tuned by magnetic or optical feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "this has not only lead to a plethora of novel observations on the many - body behavior of ultracold atomic ensembles @xcite but also raised new ultracold few - body physics such as weakly bound diatomic molecules @xcite or efimov states of timers @xcite in the universal regime close to the dissociation threshold .",
    "a particularly striking new species are the weakly bound ultra - long - range diatomic molecules composed of a ground state and a rydberg atom whose existence has been predicted theoretically a decade ago @xcite and which have been discovered experimentally only recently @xcite .",
    "the molecular born - oppenheimer potential energy curves , which are responsible for the atomic binding , show for these species a very unusual oscillatory behavior with many local minima .",
    "the latter can be understood intuitively and modeled correspondingly as the interaction of a neutral ground state atom with the rydberg electron of the second atom .",
    "the equilibrium distance for these molecular states is of the order of the size of the rydberg atom and the vibrational binding energies are in the mhz to ghz regime for principal quantum numbers @xmath1 .",
    "recently , the impact of magnetic fields on these ultra - long - range molecules @xcite and the formation of rydberg trimers and excited dimers by internal quantum reflection @xcite has been explored . moreover , it it has been shown how the electric field of a rydberg atom electron can bind a polar molecule to form a giant ultra - long - range stable polyatomic molecule @xcite and how rydberg macrodimers are formed via long - range interaction between two atoms excited into high-@xmath2 rydberg states @xcite .",
    "an exotic species of rydberg atoms in crossed electric and magnetic fields are the so - called giant dipole states ( gds ) , which have been explored theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite firstly in the 1990s .",
    "opposite to the usual rydberg states , the gds are of decentered character and possess a huge electric dipole moment .",
    "more precisely , in ref.@xcite it was shown that the total potential of the electronic motion possesses a gauge invariant term which leads to an outer potential well that supports weakly bound decentered states .",
    "the mathematical origin of these effects is the non - separability of the center of mass and electronic motion in the presence of the external fields @xcite : translation symmetry and conservation of the total momentum in field - free space is replaced by a phase space translation symmetry and the conservation of the total pseudo momentum .",
    "applications to the positronium atom have demonstrated that metastable matter - antimatter states with a lifetime of many years can be formed @xcite .",
    "more recently , giant dipole resonances of multiply excited atoms in crossed fields have been shown to exist and the corresponding electronic configurations as well as their stability have been analyzed @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we combine the concepts of atomic giant dipole states and field - free ultra - long - range diatomic molecules : we show the existence of ultra - long - range giant dipole molecules emanating from giant dipole states .",
    "they exist in a variety of different configurations with simple to complex three - dimensional potential energy surfaces such as gaussian , elliptical or toroidal wells . for higher excited states the potential energy surfaces of energetically neighboring states come close in configuration space and form higher - dimensional seams of avoided crossings that could lead to rapid decay processes of vibrational wave packets .",
    "we consider a highly excited hydrogen atom interacting with a ground state neutral perturber atom ( we will focus on the @xmath3rb atom here ) in crossed static homogeneous electric @xmath4 and magnetic @xmath5 fields .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian reads @xmath6 where ` n ' labels the neutral perturber and where the first term is the kinetic energy of the perturber atom followed by the giant dipole hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom and the interaction term between the gds and the neutral perturber .",
    "the hydrogen atom in crossed external fields has been discussed in detail in ref .",
    "there it was shown that the giant dipole hamiltonian can be transformed into an effective single particle problem in a magnetic field in the presence of a generalized potential @xmath7 which parametrically depends on the external fields and the pseudo momentum @xmath8 and contains both the motional and external electric field stark terms , @xmath9 with @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the electron charge and mass and the proton and atomic mass , respectively . @xmath12",
    "represent the coordinate and canonical momentum of the rydberg electron . for sufficiently strong electric fields",
    "the potential @xmath13 exhibits an outer well containing many bound gds which are decentered from the proton at distances of about @xmath14 , @xmath15 being the bohr radius .",
    "the latter leads to a huge electric dipole moment typically of the order of many ten thousand debye for strong electric and magnetic laboratory field strengths .",
    "expanding @xmath16 up to second order around the minimum of the outer well and performing a corresponding gauge centering @xcite we arrive at the second order giant dipole hamiltonian which represents a charged ( effective ) particle in a magnetic field and an anisotropic 3d harmonic potential , @xmath17 where the frequencies @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 characterize the anisotropy of the outer well . in this representation ,",
    "@xmath12 denote the electronic variables with respect to the outer minimum @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",

    "well the electron possesses a low kinetic energy and it is legitimate to describe the interaction with the neutral perturber by a fermi - type pseudopotential @xcite , namely , a @xmath25-wave contact potential @xmath26\\delta^{(3)}({\\mathbf{r}}-{\\mathbf{r}}_{{\\textrm{\\tiny{n } } } } ) .",
