    "the process of so - called `` isolated '' star formation , where a single star or binary stars form in one molecular cloud core , has been studied intensively @xcite . in this mode , spontaneous gravitational collapse of cloud cores initiates the formation of the protostar at the center , and there is observational evidence of such gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "another mode of star formation is cluster formation , where stellar clusters form simultaneously or sequentially in one cloud core . a vast majority ( @xmath14 90 % ) of stars form as members of clusters in our galaxy @xcite , and the understanding of the cluster formation is crucial for more comprehensive understanding of star formation .",
    "previous observational studies of cluster formation have proposed that external effects on cloud cores , such as stellar wind , hii regions @xcite , supernova @xcite , and molecular outflows @xcite , are often required to trigger cluster formation .",
    "theoretical studies also suggest that such external effects are often required to trigger cluster formation @xcite . for example",

    "the age of the cluster in cloud 2 ( @xmath0 1.0 @xmath15 10@xmath16 yr ) is younger than that of gsh 138 - 01 - 94 ( @xmath0 4.3 @xmath15 10@xmath16 yr ) , and they suggest that the star formation in cloud 2 was triggered by the interaction with the snr h i shell . in the 850 @xmath17 m dust continuum map of the ngc 1333 region ,",
    "there are several cavity and/or shell structures observed , which are most likely created by molecular outflows @xcite .",
    "one dusty core , sk-1 , is in one of these shells and is gravitationally bound , and @xcite suggest that this core is a specific example of the outflow - triggered star formation .",
    "however , these studies are presumptions mainly based on the overall morphology , and detailed studies of cluster formation processes , including spatially - resolved observations of both triggers and cloud cores and the investigation of the physical processes , have been limited .",
    "this is mainly due to the relatively far distance to cluster - forming regions and lack of interferometric observations of cluster - forming regions in millimeter and submillimeter molecular lines as well as continuum emissions .    in order to investigate the detailed mechanism of cluster formation ,",
    "we have initiated millimeter and submillimeter survey observations of the omc-2/3 region with the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) and atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ) .",

    "in addition , the velocity range of the @xmath5co ( 32 ) emission is larger than that of the @xmath5co ( 10 ) emission .",

    "since there is no 3.3-mm dust continuum counterpart associated with vla 12 ( see @xmath39 3.4 ) , the origin of the 3.6 cm free - free emission is probably the ionized jet driven by fir 3 .",

    "[ ident ] , we also list the mass of these cores corrected for the effect of the missing flux ( @xmath19 m@xmath85 ) , which can be considered as upper limits of the mass .",
    "several pieces of evidence for the interaction between the molecular outflow driven by fir 3 and fir 4 clump were found in our observations .",
    "the extent of the sw outflow lobe from fir 3 observed in the co ( 10 , 32 ) lines ( @xmath0 0.09 pc ) is shorter than that of the ne lobe ( @xmath0 0.19 pc ) .",
    "this suggests that the propagation of the sw outflow is hampered by the material at the head of the outflow , and in fact fir 4 clump locates at the tip of the south - western outflow .",
    "these pieces of morphological evidence suggest that the south - western outflow component is dammed by fir 4 clump .",
    "we also detected the sio and submillimeter ch@xmath10oh emission at the tip of the south - western outflow .",
    "these molecular lines are often observed toward shocked regions , caused by the interaction between outflows and dense gas @xcite .",
    "hence , the detection of the sio and submillimeter ch@xmath10oh emission in fir 4 is probably the chemical evidence for the interaction between the molecular outflow and the dense gas .",
    "in addition , the line width of the h@xmath2co@xmath3 emission at fir 4 ( dv@xmath86 @xmath0 1.1 km s@xmath20 ) is larger than the average value in other omc-2/3 cores ( dv@xmath86 @xmath0 0.8 km s@xmath20 ; * ? ? ? * ) which may suggest the larger turbulence due to the interaction with the outflow .",
    "figure [ pv]a - d show position - velocity ( p - v ) diagrams in the @xmath5co , h@xmath2co@xmath3 , sio , and the ch@xmath10oh emission .",
    "the p - v diagrams in the @xmath5co , h@xmath2co@xmath3 , sio , and the ch@xmath10oh emission show successive change of the line width along the direction from fir 3 to fir 4 .",
    "first , the @xmath5co ( 10 ) emission shows a distinct l - shaped structure in the p - v diagram , and the location of the line broadening is at the most upstream .",
    "second , the ch@xmath10oh emission also shows a similar l - shape with a less broadening , which locates slightly at the downstream from the co l - shape . the sio emission shows the most extreme blueshifted components , which locates at the peak of the blueshifted ch@xmath7oh component .",
    "finally , the dense gas component traced by the h@xmath2co@xmath3 emission locates at the most downstream of the successive emission distribution and is pinched by the l - shaped co emission distribution in the p - v diagram .",
    "these successive emission distributions and the velocity structures are likely to trace the detail of the interaction .",
    "these observational results suggest an interconnection among the molecular outflow , dense gas , and the shock traced by the sio and ch@xmath10oh emission .",
    "we consider that these pieces of evidence support the presence of the interaction between the molecular outflow and dense gas .      in the last section",
    ", we suggest that there is an interaction between the outflow driven by fir 3 and dense gas of fir 4 clump . on the other hand ,",
    "in @xmath39 3.4 we have demonstrated that fir 4 clump consists of eleven dusty cores . from these results",
    ", we presume that the interaction causes the fragmentation of fir 4 clump into these cores and eventually the formation of the next generation of the cluster members .",
    "hereafter we will examine this possibility from consideration of the jeans instability , time scale , and the virial analyses .",
    "first , we will examine whether the fragmentation into the dusty cores can be caused by the jeans instability , by comparing the average separation of the cores to the jeans length .",
    "the average 3-dimensional separation ( @xmath19 @xmath87 ) among these cores can be estimated by the following formula @xcite ;    @xmath88    @xmath89    where @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 are the volume filling factor , the average radius of the cores , the number of cores , and the average volume of fir4 clump and a single core , respectively .",
    "v@xmath95 was estimated from the average of the projected size of the dusty cores ( table [ core ] ) , and v@xmath96 was estimated from the radius of 15@xmath1 , on the assumption of the 3-dimensional spherical symmetry ( see eq .",
    "the estimated v@xmath95 , v@xmath96 , and @xmath91 are @xmath97 @xmath98 , @xmath99 @xmath98 , and @xmath100 au , respectively .",
    "then , the average separation @xmath87 is estimated to be @xmath0 @xmath101 au .    in order to estimate the jeans length ( @xmath19 @xmath102 ) , we use the following equation @xcite ;    @xmath103    where @xmath65 , g , and @xmath104 are the effective sound speed , gravitational constant , and the average density of fir 4 clump , respectively .",
    "@xmath65 is the effective sound speed in fir 4 clump ( @xmath0 0.62 km s@xmath20 ) derived from equation ( 4 ) , and @xmath104 is estimated to be 9.8 @xmath15 10@xmath105 @xmath82 in @xmath39 3.4 . with these values , the jeans length @xmath106 is estimated to be @xmath0 @xmath107 au , which is on the same order of the average separation of the dusty cores .",
    "hence it is possible that the fragmentation of fir 4 clump into cores was caused by the jeans instability .",
    "the jeans instability in fir 4 clump may be triggered by the interaction with the outflow from fir 3 , and in the next section we will discuss whether the fragmentation was caused after the interaction between the outflow driven by fir 3 and fir 4 clump .      we can estimate the time scale of the fragmentation on the assumption that the fragmentation time scale ( @xmath19 @xmath108 ) is the sound crossing time ;    @xmath109    then @xmath108 is estimated to be @xmath0 @xmath110 yr .",
    "next , we estimate the time scale of the interaction between the outflow and dense gas , on the assumption that the interaction time scale @xmath111 is similar to the dynamical time @xmath112 of the north - eastern outflow driven by fir 3 , i.e. @xmath111 @xmath0 @xmath112 . @xcite",
    "estimated @xmath112 to be @xmath113 yr .",
    "then the interaction time scale @xmath111 is estimated to be @xmath113 yr .",
    "therefore , the fragmentation time scale ( 3.8 @xmath15 10@xmath114 yr ) is similar to the interaction time scale ( 1.4 @xmath15 10@xmath114 yr ) , and we suggest that the fragmentation was triggered by the interaction with the outflow from fir 3",
    ". moreover , the free - fall time in this region ( @xmath0 1.3 @xmath13 yr ) , which is estimated from the average density of each core ( @xmath0 1.6 @xmath15 10@xmath81 @xmath82 ) , is also similar to the interaction time - scale , and hence it is possible that class 0/i protostars are already formed in the course of the interaction @xcite . in fact , there exists an mir source ( mir 24 ) identified as a class 0 protostar , and it is possible that mir 24 is formed in the course of the interaction .",
    "we suggest that in this particular case of fir 4 the interaction between the outflow and the dense gas most likely triggers the fragmentation into cores , while we can not exclude other possibilities such as the induced fragmentation due to the interaction with the hii region ( m43 ) @xcite as well as spontaneous fragmentation due to the gravity @xcite and turbulence @xcite .",
    "finally , in order to examine whether these dusty cores have a potential to form protostars inside , we compare the h@xmath26 mass of the cores estimated from the 3.3 mm dust - continuum flux and the virial mass . the virial mass ( @xmath19 m@xmath115 ) is estimated by the following equation ;    @xmath116    where @xmath91 , @xmath65 and g are the radius of the core , the effective sound speed ( equation 4 ) and the gravitational constant , respectively . here",
    ", we assume that the h@xmath2co@xmath3 emission is associated with all the dusty cores .",
    "then we adopted the h@xmath2co@xmath3 line width ( @xmath64 ; see table [ ident ] ) at each peak of the dusty core as the line width in the dusty cores .",
    "the estimated virial masses are within the range of the expected h@xmath26 mass of these cores , that is , from m@xmath84 to m@xmath85 ( table [ ident ] ) .",
    "these results suggest that the observed dusty cores have a potential to form stars .    from the above considerations",
    ", we suggest that the interaction between fir 4 clump and the outflow driven by fir 3 caused the fragmentation of fir 4 clump into cores and triggered the next generation of cluster formation .",
    "our scenario of the star formation in the fir 4 region is summarized in figure [ scenario ] as ;    [ step 1 ] : fir 3 was born and drove the outflow ;    [ step 2 ] : the outflow driven by fir 3 started interacting with fir 4 clump ;    [ step 3 ] : the interaction caused the fragmentation of fir 4 clump into cores ;    [ step 4 ] : these cores will form stars .    the present stage of the star formation in the fir 4 region may be between step 3 and step 4 .",
    "we speculate that dusty cores will form protostars inside , and eventually , next generation of the stellar cluster in the fir 4 region .",
    "possible outflow - triggered star formation has also been reported observationally in ngc 1333 @xcite , l1551 ne @xcite , and ngc 2264 irs 1 @xcite . in ngc 1333 , @xcite found that one of the cores in the 850 @xmath17 m emission ( sk-1 ) locates at the tip of the shell evacuated by the outflow , and they suggest that sk-1 is a possible example of the outflow - triggered star formation . in l 1551",
    "ne , @xcite have found an arc - shape structure of dense gas open toward south - west , or the direction of the molecular outflow driven by l1551 irs 5 , in the cs ( 32 ) emission .",
    "they interpret that the dense gas in l1551 ne is affected by the outflow from l1551 irs 5 , creating an arc - shape , and the protostellar formation of l1551 ne . in ngc",
    "2264 irs 1 , @xcite have found that a dense - gas shell seen in the h@xmath2co@xmath3 emission locates around the outflow driven by irs 1 , and at the inner edge of the dense shell there are three compact cores .",
    "they suggest that these cores are entrained or compressed material formed by the outflow and that these cores may represent future sites of the formation of a group of the low - mass stars .",
    "our observational studies in the omc-2 fir 3/4 region have suggested that the interaction between the outflow and dense gas can cause the formation of stellar clusters .",
    "recent 3-dimensional mhd simulations by @xcite suggest that protostellar outflows can trigger cluster formation through shock compression , providing a theoretical support to our scenario .",
    "we have carried out high angular - resolution ( @xmath0 3@xmath1 - 7@xmath1 ) millimeter interferometric observations of omc-2 fir 3/4 with the nma in the h@xmath2co@xmath3 ( @xmath4=10 ) , @xmath5co ( @xmath4=10 ) , cs ( @xmath4=21 ) , and sio ( @xmath6=0 , @xmath4=21 ) lines as well as in the 3.3 mm continuum emission , and submillimeter single - dish observations with aste in the @xmath5co ( @xmath4=32 ) and ch@xmath7oh ( @xmath8=@xmath117@xmath118 ) lines .",
    "the main results of our new millimeter and submillimeter observations are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we suggest that the outflow driven by fir 3 interacts with the 0.07 pc - scale dense gas associated with fir 4 ( @xmath19 fir 4 clump ) , from morphological , kinematical , chemical and physical evidence . in the morphological evidence",
    ", we found that the length of the sw outflow lobe from fir 3 observed in the co ( 10 , 32 ) lines ( @xmath0 0.09 pc ) is shorter than that of the ne lobe ( @xmath0 0.19 pc ) , and fir 4 clump is located at the tip of the sw molecular outflow .",
    "these results suggest that the sw lobe has been dammed by the interaction with fir 4 clump . in the chemical and physical evidence",
    ", we detected the sio ( @xmath6=0 , @xmath4=2 - 1 ) emission and the submillimeter ch@xmath7oh ( @xmath8=7@xmath9 - 6@xmath9 ; k=-1,0,2 ) emission around fir 4 clump , which are known to trace shocks caused by the interaction between outflows and dense cores . in the kinematical evidence ,",
    "the p - v diagrams in the @xmath5co , ch@xmath10oh , sio , and h@xmath2co@xmath3 emission show a successive change of the line width along the direction from fir 3 to fir 4 . the @xmath5co ( 10 )",

    "the ch@xmath10oh emission also shows a similar l - shape at the downstream from the co l - shape , and the sio emission shows the most blueshifted component at the peak of the blueshifted ch@xmath7oh component .",
    "the dense gas component traced by the h@xmath2co@xmath3 emission locates at the most downstream of the successive emission distribution and is pinched by the l - shaped co emission distribution in the p - v diagram .",
    "these results indicate the presence of the interaction between the outflow and dense gas in fir 4",
    ". 2 .   in the 3.3-mm continuum emission ,",
    "we have first resolved fir 4 clump into eleven dusty cores with a size of 1500 - 4000 au and a mass of 0.2 - 1.4 m@xmath11 .",
    "the 3-dementinal separation among these cores , 5000 au , is on the same order of the jeans length , 13000 au .",
    "moreover , the estimated time scale of the fragmentation into the cores , 3.8 @xmath119 yr , is also similar to the time scale of the interaction between fir 4 clump and the outflow from fir 3 , that is , 1.4 @xmath13 yr .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the fragmentation of fir 4 clump into the cores has been caused by the jeans instability triggered by the interaction with the outflow driven by fir 3 .",
    "we suggest that in this particular case of fir 4 the outflow interaction most likely triggers the fragmentation into cores .",
    "we speculate that the dusty cores in fir 4 will form protostellar sources eventually , and that the fir 4 region is in the course of cluster formation .",
