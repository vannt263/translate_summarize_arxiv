    "this allows the detection of entanglement between arbitrary subsystems also if the spin hamiltonian can not be reliably known , as is the case when the fit is not univocal , or even impractical , due to the size of the hilbert space .",
    "it should also be noticed that neutron scattering requires samples containing a macroscopic number of identical spin clusters , and is thus well suited for the study of molecular nanomagnets .",
    "four - dimensional inelastic neutron scattering has recently been applied to the cr@xmath246 molecule @xcite , essentially consisting in an octagon of @xmath247 spins .",
    "the equal - time correlation functions that have been measured provide a direct experimental demonstration of entanglement between the ring subsystems considered in subection [ subsecrings ] . in the low - temperature limit ,",
    "the state of cr@xmath246 approximately coincides with a spin singlet ( @xmath248 ) , whereas the partial spin sums @xmath249 approximtely correspond to 37 and 2 for the partitions represented in fig .",
    "[ figstruct ] ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "these values imply the violation of the inequalities reported in eqs .",
    "[ eq11 ] and [ eq09 ] . at low temperatures ,",
    "the subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath2 of cr@xmath246 are thus entangled for both the above partitions .",
    "such an experimental investigation of entanglement can also be applied to dimers of weakly - coupled molecules , such as ( cr@xmath159ni)@xmath160 .",
    "these systems , that are of potential interest for quantum computation @xcite and simulation @xcite , have in fact been synthesized in large high - quality crystals , that are well suited for neutron - scattering . in particular , the inequalities eq . [ eqa02],[eq09 ] can be used to prove the existence of entanglement between the two cr@xmath159ni molecules , also if the inter - ring exchange @xmath250 is large enough to induce a small but finite amount of @xmath51-mixing in each ring , and the macrospin approximation for these does nt apply @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "the present approach allows one to apply entanglement witnesses and spin - squeezing inequalities to the detection of entanglement between collective spins .",
    "the inequalities have been applied to a number of prototypical spin clusters , characterized by different geometries and coupling regimes . here , entanglement between complementary subsystems is systematically detected in the ground state .",
    "the threshold temperature , above which thermal entanglement vanishes , is lower that the one obtained from the temperature dependence of the negativity , by a factor of the order of 2 .",
    "approximate expressions have been derived for the lower bounds in the inequality , that allow the derivation of all the relevant quantities from spin - pair correlation functions .",
    "the values of these expressions typically approaches from below that of the exact expressions in the parameter range of interest .",
    "we note that , while this relation can not been taken from granted in general , the validity of the assumption underlying the approximation ( i.e. , small fluctuations of the partial spin sums ) can always be verified experimentally .",
