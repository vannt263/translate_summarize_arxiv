    "it is widely known that a massive object of mass @xmath0 such as a globular cluster passing through a background of non - colliding particles suffers a gravitational effect usually referred to as dynamical friction ( df ) .",
    "historically , this problem was first studied by chandrasekhar ( 1943 ) who first recognized its true dissipative nature .",
    "he analyzed the idealized case where a point mass moves through an infinity , homogeneous sea of field particles and showed that a fraction of the kinetic energy of the incoming object is transferred to the stellar collisionless population whose distribution was described by a maxwelllian velocity .",
    "the df mechanism is now a classical effect for description and evolution of almost all many - body astrophysical systems .",
    "some examples involve the formation of stellar galactic nuclei via merging of old globular clusters ( gcs ) @xcite , the transformation from non - nucleated dwarf galaxies into nucleated ones @xcite , the behavior of radio galaxies in galaxy clusters @xcite , nonlinear gaseous medium @xcite and the field particles with a mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "traditionally , such investigations were carried out in the framework of newtonian gravity , however , alternative gravity theories like the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) has also been considered @xcite .    in the last few years",
    ", several authors have discussed the problem related to the dynamical friction timescale ( @xmath5 ) of a gc orbiting dwarf galaxies or infalling satellite galaxies in clusters ( read _ et al .",

    "_ 2010 ) . in particular ,",
    "when dwarf galaxies have a cored dark matter halo with constant density distribution in its center it has been found that the df effects will be considerably modified .",
    "some analyses based on @xmath4-body simulations @xcite and semi - analytical models have shown that the expected sinking of cgs to the galactic center may take a time beyond the age of the universe .    in order to explain this suppression effect and the consequent problem of extremely long @xmath5 , some authors introduced additional ingredients , among them : the loss mass of the gcs by stripping and heating tidal @xcite , and the interaction between the dark matter halo and the gc @xcite .",
    "all these possibilities are based on the standard chandrasekhar s df formula derived by assuming a maxwellian distribution . here",
    "we investigate a different route by considering that the solution for this problem is related to a proper extension of the underlying statistical approach .",
    "it is well known that the so - called nonextensive statistical approach provides an analytical extension of boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) statistical mechanics which is very convenient when long - range forces are present and/or the system is out ( but close ) to a thermal equilibrium state .",
    "this ensemble theory is based on the formulation of a generalized entropy proposed by tsallis ( 1988,2009 )    @xmath6    which reduces in the limit @xmath7 to the bg entropy @xmath8 , since @xmath9 is the probability of finding the systems in the microstate @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the number of microstates and @xmath12 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "however , when the index @xmath13 , the entropy of the system is nonextensive , i.e , given two subsystems @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the entropy is no more additive in the sense that @xmath16 .",
    "the long - range interactions are associated to the last term on the r.h.s . which accounts for correlations between the subsystems with the index @xmath2 quantifying the degree of statistical correlations .",
    "such a statistical description has been successfully applied to many complex physical systems ranging from physics to astrophysics and plasma physics , among them : the electrostatic plane - wave propagation in a collisionless thermal plasma ( lima , silva & santos 2000 ) , the peculiar velocity function of galaxies clusters @xcite , gravothermal instability @xcite , the kinetic concept of jeans gravitational instability ( lima , silva & santos 2002 ) , and the radial and projected density profiles for two large classes of isothermal stellar systems @xcite .",
    "a wide range of physical applications can also be seen in gell - mann & tsallis 2004 ( see also http://tsallis.cat.cbpf.br/biblio.htm for an updated bibliography ) .    in this letter , by assuming that a self - gravitating collisionless gas is described by the nonextensive kinetic theory ( silva _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ; lima _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) , we derive a new analytical formula for dynamical friction which generalizes the chandrasekhar result . as an application , the df timescale ( @xmath5 ) for gcs falling in the galaxies center is derived for the case of a singular isothermal sphere .",
    "this result suggest that the long timescales for gcs can be understood as a departure from the extensive regime . in other words",
    ", there is no suppression of the df since the long time can be just the statistical price to pay by the presence of long range forces acting on the gravitational systems .",
    "by following chandrasekhar ( 1943 ) , the df deceleration on a test mass @xmath0 moving with velocity @xmath17 in a homogeneous and isotropic distribution of identical field particles of mass @xmath18 and number density @xmath19 reads : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the gravitational constant , @xmath18 is the mean mass of field stars and @xmath22 represents their velocity distribution .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 depends on the ratio of the the maximum ( @xmath24 ) and minimum ( @xmath25 ) impact parameters of the encounters contributing to generate the dragging force . in the applications of df",
    ", it is usually assumed that the distribution function of the stellar velocity field can be described by a maxwellian distribution @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes a normalized velocity with @xmath28 indicating their dispersion .",
    "the integration of ( [ eq1 ] ) results : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and the function @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 with @xmath33 defining the error function as @xmath34    now , in order to investigate the nonextensive effects on the chandrasekhar theory , let us consider that the stellar field obeys the following power - law ( silva , plastino & lima 1998 , lima , silva & plastino 2001 , lima & de souza 2005 ) :    @xmath35    where the so - called @xmath2-exponential is defined by @xmath36^{\\frac{1}{1-q}},\\ ] ] and the quantity @xmath37 denotes a normalization constant which depends on the interval of the @xmath2-parameter . for values of @xmath38 ,",
    "the positiviness of power argument means that distribution above exhibits a cut - off in the maximal allowed velocities . in this case , all velocities lie on the interval @xmath39 and their maximum value is @xmath40 . taking this into account",
    "one may show that the normalization constant @xmath37 can be written in terms of gamma functions as follows : @xmath41    for generic values of @xmath13 , the df ( [ eq5 ] ) is a power law , whereas for @xmath3 it reduces to the standard maxwell - boltzmann distribution function ( [ eq2 ] ) since @xmath42 at this limit .",
    "formally , this result follows directly from the known identity , @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the distribution ( [ eq5 ] ) is uniquely determined from two simple requirements ( silva _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) : ( i ) isotropy of the velocity space , and ( ii ) a suitable nonextensive generalization of the maxwell factorizability condition , or equivalently , the assumption that @xmath44 . the kinetic foundations of the above distribution were also investigated in a deeper level through the generalized boltzmann s equation , in particular , it was also shown that the kinetic version of the tsallis entropy satisfies an extended @xmath45-theorem ( lima , silva & plastino 2001 ) .    now , by considering that the power - law distribution ( [ eq5 ] ) is a valid description for the stellar velocity distribution we conclude that the expression describing the df in this extended framework takes the following form : @xmath46 which after an elementary integration can be rewritten as : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the general function depending on the @xmath2-parameter ( compare with eq .",
    "( 5 ) )    @xmath49    in the above expression , the integral @xmath50 is the @xmath2-generalization of the error function ( see eq.(6 ) ) .",
    "as one may check , the nonextensive expression for the df ( including the auxiliary functions @xmath45 and @xmath51 ) reduces to the chandrasekhar result in the gaussian limit ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "it shows clearly that the collective effect from gravitational interactions of @xmath0 ( with all stars of the field ) is strongly dependent on the statistical model .",
    "an interesting aspect of the above formulae is that the results are expressed by analytical expressions . in principle",
    ", they can be useful for semi - analytical implementations because the easy comparison with the standard approach ( see next section ) . naturally , we are also advocating here that the idealized framework based on the maxwellian distribution ( chandrasekhar 1943 ) may be in the root of some theoretical difficulties shown by @xmath4-body simulations , like the ones related to the decay orbits of gcs .",
    "in order to illustrate some consequences of the above derivation , let us now analyze the nonextensive solution for the decaying orbit of a gc in the stellar galactic field . as a gc orbits through the galaxy field ,",
    "it is subject to df due to its interaction with the stellar distribution . by assuming spherically symmetric star distribution , the dragging force decelerates the cluster motion which loses energy thereby spiraling toward the galaxy center",
    "therefore , whether the gc is initially on a circular orbit of radius @xmath52 , it is convenient to define an average df timescale , @xmath5 , as the time required for the cluster reach the galaxy center . for the sake of simplicity , we also consider that the mass density distribution of the galaxy is described by the singular isothermal sphere @xmath53 with @xmath54 being circular speed and @xmath55 the velocity dispersion .",
    "this simplified mass distribution has the benefit of having a planar rotation curve and therefore might be considered as a crude but minimally realistic distribution for the external region of normal galaxies . following standard lines ,",
    "the frictional force undergone by the cluster of mass @xmath0 moving with speed @xmath54 through the stellar field now reads : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the general function ( [ eq6c ] ) written in the coordinate @xmath58 . note also that the integral @xmath59 defined in ( [ eq6d ] ) now reduces to @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the gauss hypergeometric function .",
    "either from the above representation or from the integral form ( [ eq6d ] ) , we see that the error function @xmath62 is obtained as a particular case in the extensive regime , that is , @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "it means that @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "now , returning to expression ( [ eq8 ] ) , we recall that the dragging force is tangential to the cluster orbits , and , therefore , the cluster gradually loses angular moment per unit mass @xmath65 at a rate @xmath66 .",
    "since @xmath67 we can rewritten equation ( [ eq8 ] ) as @xmath68 by solving this differential equation subjected to the initial condition , @xmath69 , we find that the cluster reaches the galaxy center after a time @xmath70 this nonextensive timescale for decaying orbits of gcs generalizes the chandrasekhar result ( see binney & tremaine 2008 ) which is readily recovered in the gaussian extensive limit ( @xmath71 ) .    at this point",
    ", it is interesting to compare the above nonextensive prediction with the standard result based on the chandrasekhar approach . to begin with ,",
    "let us assume typical values for the parameters @xmath52 , @xmath54 and @xmath0 , namely : @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 . with these choices",
    "we get : @xmath75 which reduces to the standard value in limiting case ( @xmath3 ) as given by binney & tremaine ( 2008 ) . the nonextensive corrections are more directly quantified by introducing the dynamic time ratio , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 denotes the chandrasekhar result . by using ( 18 ) we find @xmath78 where the function @xmath79 was defined by eq . ( 11 ) .    in figure 1",
    ", we display the nonextensive corrections for a large range of the nonextensive @xmath2-parameter . as a general result",
    ", we see that the @xmath80 ratio is strongly dependent on the q - parameter .",
    "the nonextensive time scale is greater or less than the extensive chandrashekhar result depending on the interval of the @xmath2-parameter .",
    "note also that @xmath81 is greater or smaller than @xmath77 if @xmath82 or @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "we have derived the @xmath2-dynamic friction force for a point mass moving through a homogeneous background in the context of the nonextensive kinetic theory .",
    "simple and analytical forms were obtained , and , as should be expected , they smoothly reduce to the standard chandrashekar results in the extensive limiting case ( @xmath3 ) . however , for @xmath13 a large variety of qualitatively different behaviors are predicted when the free parameter @xmath2 is continuously varied ( see figs . 1 e 2 ) . as an application",
    ", we have discussed the dynamical timescale for a globular cluster collapsing to the center of a massive dark matter halo described by an isothermal sphere .",
    "the results presented here suggest that the problem related to the large timescale shown by numerical @xmath4-body simulations and semi - analytical models may naturally be solved ( with no ad hoc mechanism ) by taking a proper @xmath2-nonextensive distribution with parameter greater than unity .",
    "applications to more realistic density profiles like the lowered nonextensive halos distribution ( silva , de souza & lima 2009 ; cardone , leubner & del popolo ) and a detailed comparison with semi - analytical models will be discussed in a forthcoming communication .",
