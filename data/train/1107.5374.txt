    "a peculiar feature of general relativity is that the theory admits a nontrivial topology of a spacetime . a solution of the einstein equation that connects distant points of space ",
    "time was introduced by @xcite .",
    "this solution called the _ einstein ",
    "rosen bridge _ was the first solution to later be referred to as a wormhole .",
    "initially , this type of solution was just a trivial or teaching example of mathematical physics .",
    "however , @xcite proved that some wormholes are `` traversable '' ; i.e. , space and time travel can be achieved by passing through the wormholes .",
    "they also showed that the existence of a wormhole requires exotic matter that violates the null energy condition .",
    "the existence of wormholes , though they are very exotic , has not been ruled out in theory .",
    "inspired by the morris ",
    "thorne paper , a number of theoretical works ( see @xcite and references therein ) on wormholes have been done .",
    "the curious nature of wormholes such as time travel , negative energy conditions , space  time foams , and growth of a wormhole in an accelerating universe have been studied . in spite of enthusiastic theoretical investigations , studies searching for observational evidence of the existence of wormholes",
    "are scarce .",
    "only a few attempts have been made to show the existence or nonexistence of wormholes in our universe @xcite .",
    "a possible observational method that has been proposed to detect or exclude the existence of wormholes is the application of optical gravitational lensing , since the light ray propagation is sensitive to a local spacetime geometry .",
    "the gravitational lensing of wormholes was pioneered by @xcite , who inferred that some wormholes show `` negative mass '' lensing .",
    "they showed that the light curve of the negative - mass lensing event of a distant star has singular double peaks .",
    "several authors subsequently conducted theoretical studies on detectability @xcite .",
    "another gravitational lensing method employing gamma rays was proposed by @xcite , who postulated that the singular negative - mass lensing of distant active galactic nuclei causes a sharp spike of gamma rays and may be observed as double - peaked gamma - ray bursts .",
    "they analyzed batse data to put an upper limit to the negative mass density @xmath3 in the form of wormholelike objects .",
    "there have been several recent works @xcite on the gravitational lensing of wormholes as structures of space  time .",
    "such studies are expected to unveil lensing properties directly from the space  time structure .",
    "one study @xcite calculated the deflection angle of light due to the ellis wormhole , whose asymptotic mass at infinity is zero .",
    "the massless wormhole is particularly interesting because it is expected to have unique gravitational lensing effects .",
    "this type of wormhole was first introduced by @xcite as a massless scalar field .",
    "later , @xcite studied this wormhole and proved it to be traversable .",
    "the dynamical feature was studied by @xcite , who showed that gaussian perturbation causes either explode to an inflationary universe or collapse to a black hole .",
    "@xcite showed that the tachyon condensate can be a source for the ellis geometry .",
    "@xcite provided a method to calculate light curves of the gravitational microlensing of the ellis wormhole in the weak - field limit .",
    "this result has been discussed as one example of corrections to the standard formula of the deflection angle by @xcite .",
    "the main results of this paper are : ( 1 ) we derive analytic expressions for calculations of the wormhole lensing .",
    "we show the astrometric image centroid trajectory by the ellis wormhole lens . studies of centroid displacements of lensed images have been limited within the schwarzschild lens @xcite . in section 2 ,",
    "we discuss gravitational lensing by the ellis wormhole in the weak - field limit .",
    "we use a suitable coordinate transformation , such that the lens equation to determine image positions can take a much simpler form than the previous one derived by @xcite . by using this method ,",
    "calculations of the gravitational microlensing by the ellis wormhole are shortened .",
    "in addition , we prove that two images always appear for the weak - field lens by the ellis wormhole . in section 3",
    ", we discuss astrometric image centroid displacements due to gravitational microlensing by the ellis wormhole .",
    "the results are summarized in section 4 .",
    "magnification of the apparent brightness of a distant star by the gravitational lensing effect of another star was predicted by @xcite .",
    "this kind of lensing effect is called `` microlensing '' because the images produced by the gravitational lensing are very close to each other and are difficult for the observer to resolve .",
    "the observable effects are not only the changing apparent brightness of the source star but also the shift in the image centroid position .",
    "the brightness changing effect was discovered in 1993 @xcite and has been used to detect astronomical objects that do not emit observable signals ( such as visible light , radio waves , and x rays ) or are too faint to observe .",
    "microlensing has successfully been applied to detect extrasolar planets @xcite and brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "microlensing is also used to search for unseen black holes @xcite and massive compact halo objects @xcite , a candidate for dark matter .",
    "the gravity of a star is well expressed by the schwarzschild metric .",
    "the gravitational microlensing of the schwarzschild metric @xcite has been studied in the weak - field limit . in this section ,",
    "we simply follow the method used for schwarzschild lensing .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the relation between the source star , the lens ( wormhole ) , and the observer .",
    "the ellis wormhole is known to be a massless wormhole , which means that the asymptotic mass at infinity is zero .",
    "the ellis wormhole is expressed by the line element @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the throat radius of the wormhole .",
    "however , this wormhole deflects light by gravitational lensing @xcite because of its curved space ",
    "time structure .",
    "the deflection angle @xmath6 of the ellis wormhole was derived by @xcite to be @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the closest approach of the light . in the weak - field limit ( @xmath9 ) ,",
    "the deflection angle becomes @xmath10 note that @xcite treatment is true of the weak - field region but it may be corrected in the strong - field one , because they assume that @xmath11 were singular and it could be excluded as is the case for the schwarzschild metric . for the ellis wormhole , however , @xmath11 is not a singularity but a regular sphere and hence @xmath11 can not be excluded in the strong - field lensing .",
    "the angle between the lens ( wormhole ) and the source @xmath12 can then be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the distances from the observer to the lens , from the observer to the source , and from the lens to the source , and the impact parameter of the light , respectively . in the asymptotic limit , schwarzschild lensing and massive janis  newman",
    " winnicour ( jnw ) wormhole lensing @xcite have the same leading term of @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the lensing property of the jnw wormhole is approximately the same as that of schwarzschild lensing and is difficult to distinguish .",
    "as shown in equation ( [ eqn : defl ] ) , the deflection angle of the ellis wormhole does not have the term of @xmath18 and starts from @xmath19 .",
    "this is due to the massless nature of the ellis wormhole and indicates the possibility of observational discrimination from the ordinary gravitational lensing effect . in the weak - field limit",
    ", @xmath17 is approximately equal to the closest approach @xmath8 . for the ellis wormhole , @xmath20 .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath21 the light passing through the other side of the lens may also form images . however , equation ( [ eqn : proj ] ) represents deflection in the wrong direction at @xmath22 .",
    "thus , we must change the sign of the deflection angle : @xmath23 it would be useful to note that a single equation is suitable both for @xmath24 and @xmath22 images in the schwarzschild lensing .",
    "however , such treatment is applicable only when the deflection angle is an odd function of @xmath8 .",
    "if the source and lens are completely aligned along the line of sight , the image is expected to be circular ( an einstein ring ) .",
    "the einstein radius @xmath25 , which is defined as the radius of the circular image on the lens plane , is obtained from equation ( [ eqn : proj ] ) with @xmath26 as @xmath27{\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\frac{d_l d_{ls}}{d_s } a^2}. \\label{eqn : re}\\ ] ]    the image positions can then be calculated from @xmath28 and @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the angle between the image and lens , and @xmath31 is the angular einstein radius . using reduced parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 , equations ( [ eqn : imgeq ] ) and ( [ eqn : imgeq2 ] ) become simple cubic formulas : @xmath34 and @xmath35    following abe ( 2010 ) , first , we briefly summarize how to obtain the roots of the above equations . as the discriminant of equation ( [ eqn : poly ] ) is @xmath36 , equation ( [ eqn : poly ] ) has two conjugate complex solutions and a real solution : @xmath37 with , @xmath38{\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}^3}{27 } + \\frac{1}{2 } \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}\\left(1 + \\frac{2 \\hat{\\beta}^3}{27}\\right)^2 - \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}^6}{27 ^ 2}}}.\\ ] ] the real positive solution corresponds to the physical image .",

    "only the solution @xmath46 corresponds to a physical image inside the einstein ring .    in both cases of @xmath47 and @xmath45 ,",
    "careful treatments of @xmath48 inside the square roots and the cube ones are required in order to know which they are a real positive , real negative or complex .",

    ", we use @xmath85and @xmath86 .",
    "hence , the total magnification of the brightness @xmath87 is @xmath88    the relation between the lens and source trajectory in the sky is shown in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath48 is @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the impact parameter of the source trajectory and @xmath91 is the time of closest approach .",
    "@xmath92 is the einstein radius crossing time given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the transverse velocity of the lens relative to the source and observer .",

    "@xcite found that the magnifications by the ellis wormhole are generally less than those of schwarzschild lensing .",
    "the light curve of the ellis wormhole for @xmath95 shows characteristic gutters on both sides of the peak immediately outside the einstein ring crossing times ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "the depth of the gutters is about 4% from the baseline .",
    "amazingly , the star becomes fainter than normal in terms of apparent brightness in the gutters .",
    "this means that the ellis wormhole lensing has off - center divergence . in conventional gravitational lensing theory",
    "@xcite , the convergence of light is expressed by a convolution of the surface mass density .",
    "thus , we need to introduce negative mass to describe a diverging lens ( like a concave lens in optics ) by the ellis wormhole . however , negative mass is not a physical entity .",
    "since the lensing by the ellis wormhole is converging at the center , lensing at some other place must be diverging because the wormhole has zero asymptotic mass and hence converging and diverging effects are compensated each other in total .    for @xmath97",
    ", the light curve of the wormhole has a basin at @xmath91 and no peak . using these features , discrimination from schwarzschild lensing",
    "can be achieved .",
    "equations ( [ eqn : re ] ) and ( [ eqn : te ] ) indicate that physical parameters ( @xmath14 , @xmath5 , and @xmath94 ) are degenerate in @xmath92 and can not be derived by fitting the light - curve data .",
    "this situation is the same as that for schwarzschild lensing . to obtain or constrain these values , observations of the finite - source effect @xcite or parallax @xcite are necessary .",
    "astrometry gives a method for breaking the degeneracy as discussed later .    in analogy with the center of the mass distribution , the centroid position of the light distribution of a gravitationally microlensed source",
    "is given by @xmath98 in making numerical figures , we employ @xmath99 coordinates in the way that the center is chosen as the location of the ellis wormhole , @xmath100-axis is taken along the direction of the source motion and @xmath101-axis is perpendicular to the source motion .",
    "see figure [ fig5 ] for the image centroid trajectories for @xmath102 . for each @xmath103 , the maximum difference between the image centroid position by the ellis wormhole and that by the schwarzschild one is @xmath104 in the units of the einstein ring radius , respectively .",
    "this implies that the astrometric lensing by the ellis wormhole is relatively weaker than that by the schwarzschild one .    in the weak - field region ,",
    "the suppression of the anomalous shift of the image centroid position is because the bending angle by the ellis wormhole is proportional to the inverse squared impact parameter , whereas that by the schwarzschild lens depends on the inverse impact parameter .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the relative displacement of the image centroid with respect to the source position that is assumed to be in uniform linear motion .",
    "the maximum vertical displacement is @xmath105 for @xmath102 , respectively . here",
    ", a key question is whether the ellis lensing and the schwarzschild one are distinguished from the centroid displacement curve .",
    "the relative displacement trajectory by the schwarzschild lens is known to be an ellipse @xcite .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the displacement curve by the ellis wormhole lens is also an ellipse .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows that the relative trajectory by the ellis lens looks like an ellipse but has a small difference .",
    "the shape is symmetric along the @xmath100-axis but slightly asymmetric along the @xmath101-axis like a tree leaf , particularly for @xmath106 .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] , however , shows that such a deviation of the relative trajectory from elliptic orbits is very small .",
    "another difference is that the relative displacement at large @xmath107 , for instance @xmath108 or @xmath109 , is dependent strongly on the ellis lens or the schwarzschild one .",
    "this is because the asymptotic behavior of the centroid displacement is different ( @xmath110 or @xmath111 ) . in other words , the displacement effect by",
    "the ellis lens goes away faster .",
    "this suggests that a long - term observation including a tail part of the centroid curve is required to distinguish the ellis lenses by astrometric observations alone .",
    "the detectability of the image centroid displacements of the background star depends on the timescale called _ the einstein radius crossing time _ @xmath92 that depends on the transverse velocity @xmath94 .",
    "there is no reliable estimate of @xmath94 for wormholes . following abe ( 2010 ) , we assume that the velocity of the wormhole is approximately equal to the rotation velocity of stars ( @xmath112 ) if it is bound to the galaxy . if the wormhole is not bound to our galaxy , the transverse velocity would be much higher .",
    "we assume @xmath113 @xcite for the unbound wormhole .",
    "table 2 shows the einstein radius crossing times of the ellis wormhole lensings for the galactic bulge and lmc in both bound and unbound scenarios . as the frequencies of current microlensing observations are limited to once every few hours , an event for which the timescale is less than one day is difficult to detect . to find very long timescale events ( @xmath114 ) ,",
    "long - term monitoring of events is necessary .",
    "the realistic period of observation is @xmath115 .",
    "thus , the realistic size of the throat that we can search for is limited to @xmath116 both for the galactic bulge and lmc if wormholes are bound to our galaxy . if wormholes are unbound , the detection is limited to @xmath117 .",
    "the detectability depends also on the angular shift due to the ellis wormhole lens .",
    "the typical angular scale is @xmath118 .",
    "see table 1 for the size of @xmath119 corresponding to various values of the throat radius . near future astrometry space missions such as gaia and jasmine",
    "are expected to have angular sensitivity of a few micro arcseconds , for which the detection is limited as @xmath120 km .",
    "this limit is much weaker than that by the mission life time as @xmath121 for unbound wormholes .",
    "note that there is a small difference in the image centroid position ( and its motion with time ) between the scwarzschild lensing and the ellis wormhole one . in practice , therefore , it is unlikely to detect the wormhole by astrometric observation alone .",
    "it is safe to say that the astrometric lensing provides a supplementary method of supporting a photometric detection : first , the impact parameter of the source trajectory @xmath103 is determined from light curve observations . by using the obtained @xmath103",
    ", one can fit the astrometric observations with wormhole lensing templates .",
    "if astrometric data show a better fit with a wormhole case , the detection by light curves will be reinforced .",
    "what is more important is that astrometric observations give an additional information such as the angular size of the image centroid position shift , so that the degeneracy among @xmath122 can be partially broken .    before closing this section ,",
    "let us briefly summarize the chain of logic for identifying ellis lenses .",
    "from light curves , first , we distinguish the ellis lenses from the schwarzschild ones .",
    "the best fit values of the model parameter combinations are obtained from them .",
    "next , the image centroid observations are used to partially break the parameter degeneracy .",
    "we studied the gravitational microlensing effects of the ellis wormhole in the weak - field limit .",
    "first , we performed a suitable coordinate transformation , such that the lens equation and analytic expressions of the lensed image positions can become much simpler than the previous ones .",
    "second , we proved that two images always appear for the weak - field lens by the ellis wormhole . by using these analytic results , we investigated astrometric image centroid displacements due to gravitational microlensing by the ellis wormhole . the anomalous shift of the image centroid by the ellis wormhole lens is smaller than that by the schwarzschild lens , provided that the impact parameter and the einstein ring radius are the same . therefore , the lensed image centroid by the ellis wormhole moves slower .",
    "we would like to thank professor volker perlick for invaluable comments on the ellis wormhole lensing in the strong - field region .",

    "<S> continuing work initiated in an earlier publication ( abe , apj , * 725 * ( 2010 ) 787 ) , we study the gravitational microlensing effects of the ellis wormhole in the weak - field limit . </S>",
    "<S> first , we find a suitable coordinate transformation , such that the lens equation and analytic expressions of the lensed image positions can become much simpler than the previous ones . </S>",
    "<S> second , we prove that two images always appear for the weak - field lens by the ellis wormhole . by using these analytic results , </S>",
    "<S> we discuss astrometric image centroid displacements due to gravitational microlensing by the ellis wormhole . </S>",
    "<S> the astrometric image centroid trajectory by the ellis wormhole is different from the standard one by a spherical lensing object that is expressed by the schwarzschild metric . the anomalous shift of the image centroid by the ellis wormhole lens is smaller than that by the schwarzschild lens , provided that the impact parameter and the einstein ring radius are the same </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the lensed image centroid by the ellis wormhole moves slower . such a difference , though it is very small , will be in principle applicable for detecting or constraining the ellis wormhole by using future high - precision astrometry observations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the image centroid position gives us an additional information , so that the parameter degeneracy existing in photometric microlensing can be partially broken . </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous shift reaches the order of a few micro arcsec . if our galaxy hosts a wormhole with throat radius larger than @xmath0 km . </S>",
    "<S> when the source moves tangentially to the einstein ring for instance , the maximum position shift of the image centroid by the ellis wormhole is @xmath1 normalized by the einstein ring radius . for the same source trajectory , the maximum difference between the centroid displacement by the ellis wormhole lens and that by the schwarzschild one with the same einstein ring radius is @xmath2 in the units of the einstein radius , where the negative means that the astrometric displacement by the ellis wormhole lens is smaller than that by the schwarzschild one . </S>"
