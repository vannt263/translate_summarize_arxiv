    "proper understanding of the spin structure of nucleon and associated sum rules is expected to offer an important opportunity to investigate quantum chromodynamics(qcd ) as a theory of strong interaction and hence these observables have been the active frontiers in recent years @xcite .",
    "many successful experimental programs of polarized deep - inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering in combination with remarkable theoretical efforts have been devoted in order to elucidate the internal spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "polarized deep inelastic lepton scattering experiment have been carried out at slac , cern , desy and jefferson laboratory(jlab)@xcite . with the advent of dedicated experimental facilities ,",
    "recent experiments were able to determine the spin structure functions as well as different sum rules over a wide range of @xmath2 and @xmath1 with ever increasing precision .",
    "simultaneously , tremendous progress is observed in the field of theoretical investigation in determining and understanding the shape of quarks and gluon spin distribution functions with perturbative qcd , non - perturbative qcd , chiral perturbation theory@xcite , lattice qcd@xcite , anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft)@xcite , etc .",
    ", along with different reliable theoretical models .",
    "in addition , recently available several dedicated phenomenological works@xcite in extracting polarized parton distribution function(ppdf ) as well as spin structure functions from different experiments within nlo and nnlo qcd analysis have also significant contributions towards the understanding of spin structure of the nucleon .    in quantum chromodynamics , the spin structure function @xmath3 is described as mellin convolutions between parton distribution functions ( @xmath4 ) and the wilson coefficients @xmath5 @xcite    @xmath6,\\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which consists of three parts , non - singlet ( @xmath7 $ ] ) , singlet ( @xmath8 $ ] ) and gluon ( @xmath9 $ ] ) .",
    "the @xmath1 distribution of these spin dependent non - singlet , singlet and gluon distribution functions are governed by a set of integro - differential equations , the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) equations which are given by @xcite    @xmath10    @xmath11    here @xmath12 are the polarized splitting functions @xcite .",
    "these equations are valid to all orders in the strong coupling constant @xmath13 .",
    "although qcd predicts the @xmath1 dependence of structure functions in accord with the dglap equations but they have limitations on absolute prediction of structure functions .",
    "dglap equations can not predict the initial values from which the evolution starts , they can only predict the evolution of structure functions with @xmath1 , once an initial distribution is given .",
    "further , due to its complicated mathematical structure , an exact analytic determination of the structure functions is currently out of reach and one needs to apply approximated methods to arrive on predictions from the dglap equation .",
    "accordingly several approximate numerical as well as semi - analytical methods for the solution of dglap equation have been discussed considerably over the past years @xcite . in literature",
    "there are essentially two main classes of approaches in order to have solutions of dglap equations : those that solve the equation directly in @xmath2-space and those that solve it for mellin transformations of structure functions and invert the transformation back to @xmath2-space .",
    "the approaches based on mellin transformation method have been achieved much interest because under mellin transformation the integro - differential dglap equation turns into a continuum of independent matrix differential equations , one for each value of moments(@xmath14 ) , which in turn makes the evolution more efficient numerically . however , in this regard as the mellin transformation of both the splitting functions and the initial input is required , which may not be possible for all functions , especially if higher - order corrections are included in the equations , therefore it is not possible to have exact solution to dglap equation in moment space beyond leading order .",
    "in contrast to mellin space , the @xmath2-space method is more flexible , since the inputs are only required in @xmath2-space ; however it is generally considered to less efficient numerically , because of the need to carry out the convolution in dglap equations .",
    "taking into account the advantage of being greater flexibility , despite the difficulty in obtaining high accuracy , the @xmath2-space methods have been serving as the basis of many widely used programs hoppet@xcite , qcdnum@xcite , candia@xcite etc . , and being incorporated by the cteq@xcite , mrst / mstw(see @xcite and references therein ) collaborations .",
    "in addition , several numerical and semi - analytical methods have been developed@xcite and achieved significant phenomenological success .    due to the unavailability of exact analytical way of solving the dglap equations , in current analysis this set of equations",
    "are solved numerically by using an initial input distribution for the structure function at a fixed @xmath1 , in terms of some free parameters , the parameters are so adjusted that the parametrization best fit the existing data . however , the consideration of a specific parametrization with large number of parameters is potentially a source of bias , i.e. systematic error which is very difficult to control .",
    "furthermore , when a parametrization is fitted to the data , it is very hard to obtain a determination not only of the best fitting parameters , but also of their errors . therefore , explorations of the possibility of obtaining accurate solutions of dglap evolution equations without an initial input or with initial input , consisting of less number of parameters are always interesting .",
    "nnpdf method is one of the most interesting methods which does not require to assume a functional form and it is largely bias free@xcite .    in order to perform a fit",
    ", one must start with a particular ansatz for the structure functions at some reference @xmath15 . in most of the existing fitting analysis , including those in the experimental papers it has been performed by assuming a simple power behavior based on regge theory .",
    "the small-@xmath2 behaviour of @xmath16 in accord with regge theory is given by ( see @xciteand references therein )    @xmath17    and describes the slac@xcite experimental data with @xmath18 and @xmath19@xcite .",
    "although this regge model seems to legitimate as far the early data are concerned , which were mostly taken at moderate @xmath1 ( @xmath20 ) and @xmath2 values of around @xmath21 , but the recent measurement of @xmath16 which are available within the small-@xmath2 interval @xmath22 can be described with a single regge type exchange @xmath23 , in which the intercept has a smooth @xmath1 dependence and @xmath16 varies like @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "similar behaviour was predicted with valon model@xcite and a variation from @xmath26 to @xmath27 was obtained within the interval of @xmath1 from @xmath28 to @xmath29 . on the other hand ,",
    "ref.@xcite predicts a behaviour of the type , @xmath30 , with @xmath31 in which the asymptotic scaling of @xmath16 depends on only one variable @xmath32 .",
    "in addition , there are several studies on the small-@xmath2 behaviour of non - singlet part of spin structure function(see for example @xcite ) .    in this manuscript",
    "we have investigated the small-@xmath2 behaviour of @xmath16 structure function based on a simple regge ansatz of the type @xmath33 with @xmath1 dependent intercept .",
    "the underlying idea behind the assumption of this type of model is as follows : hera measurements@xcite suggest that the behavior of @xmath34 structure function at low-@xmath2 is consistent with a dependence @xmath35 , where the coefficient @xmath36 is independent of @xmath1 and the exponent , defined by @xmath37 , is observed to rise linearly with @xmath38 . here",
    "@xmath39 is the qcd cut off parameter and @xmath40 .",
    "thus we see that the rise of the un - polarized structure function ( @xmath41 ) is much steeper than that predicted by regge theory and gets steeper and steeper as @xmath1 increases .",
    "since this observation it has been the challenging issue to resolve whether the regge intercepts for @xmath34 structure function as well as it s non - singlet , singlet and gluon parts , along with the spin structure functions are @xmath1 dependent or not .",
    "further , before the observation at hera , there are several predictions on the @xmath1 dependency of the regge intercept@xcite .",
    "these predictions as well as experimental observations at hera motivated us to consider the possibility that the regge behaved non - singlet part , @xmath42 of @xmath43 structure function is also satisfy a functional behaviour , @xmath44 similar to @xmath41 . again as both the non - singlet structure functions , @xmath42 and @xmath45 are regge behaved@xcite , therefore their @xmath2 dependency will be similar within smaller-@xmath2 region .",
    "further , in qcd the @xmath1 behaviour of these structure functions are governed by the same dglap equation .",
    "therefore the @xmath2 and @xmath1 dependency for both the non - singlet structure functions are similar and in accord with @xmath34 , and hence @xmath46 , here we assume that the @xmath1 dependency of the regge behaved structure function @xmath47 is dominated only by the intercept and it satisfies a relation of the type @xmath48 .    in order to investigate the small-@xmath2 behaviour of @xmath47 structure function , in this paper firstly",
    "we have assumed that @xmath49 satisfies the regge like behavior @xmath48 , with the @xmath1 dependent intercept within smaller @xmath2 region and then using the model as the initial input , we have solved the dglap equation analytically in leading order ( lo ) , next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and next - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) .",
    "we have performed a phenomenological analysis of these solutions in comparison with different experimental measurements@xcite as well as the predictions due to different models @xcite and achieved at a very good phenomenological success .",
    "the phenomenological success achieved in this regard reflects , on one hand the acceptability of the regge ansatz in describing the small @xmath2 behavior of the non - singlet part of spin structure function and on the other hand , the usefulness of the regge ansatz in evolving the spin structure function , @xmath50 in accord with dglap equation with a considerable precision within smaller @xmath2 region .",
    "we have utilized the solutions of the dglap equations in determining the bjorken sum rule ( bsr)@xcite .",
    "bsr relates the difference of proton and neutron structure functions integrated over all possible values of bjorken variable , @xmath2 to the nucleon axial charge @xmath51@xcite .",
    "as bsr holds the flavour non - singlet combination of the spin structure function , it is not marred by the presence of the sea quark and gluon densities about which we have very poor information in particular in the small-@xmath2 region , therefore qcd analysis by means of bsr is less complex and more accurate . at",
    "infinite four - momentum transfer squared , @xmath1 , the sum rule reads    @xmath52    however , away from @xmath53 , the polarized bjorken sum rule is given by a sum of two series in powers of the strong coupling constant @xmath54 ( leading twist pqcd correction)and in powers of @xmath55(nonperturbative higher twist corrections ) :    @xmath56 + \\sum_{i=2}^\\infty\\frac{\\mu_{2i}^{p - n}(q^2)}{q^{2i-2}}\\label{eq5 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here the leading twist term ( bracket term ) consists of pqcd results up to third order of @xmath54@xcite .",
    "recently the calculation of the fourth order contribution to the bsr is also available@xcite . the second term on r.h.s .",
    "is known as higher twist term . the higher order pqcd corrections and higher twist power corrections are significant at low-@xmath1 region(see ref . @xcite and references therein ) . in this paper",
    "we have paid attention to both the parts . as our analysis",
    "is based on the solution of dglap equation and the splitting functions for @xmath50 are not available beyond nnlo , we could not incorporate the available nnnlo corrections to bsr and restricted our study within nnlo perturbative corrections . required higher twist corrections to describe low-@xmath1 data with different perturbative orders are extracted based on a simple parametrisation and by means of fitting with the available experimental data .",
    "bsr represents the area under the curve @xmath50 from from @xmath57 to @xmath58 and in accord with nnlo pqcd , the @xmath1 dependence of this area is given by ,    @xmath59\\label{eq6}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath60 is the scale - invariant isovector axial - charge measured in neutron beta - decays@xcite .",
    "the bjorken integral can be resolved as    @xmath61    which gives    @xmath62    the integral on the left hand side of ( [ eq8 ] ) represents the area under the curve @xmath63 from @xmath64 to @xmath58 . for @xmath65",
    ", this integral will tend to cover the whole area under the curve from @xmath66 to @xmath58 , that is , it will represent the bjorken integral .",
    "again the second part on the right side of ( [ eq8 ] ) represents the part of total area @xmath67 , laying under the curve @xmath63 within smaller @xmath2 region i.e. , from @xmath57 to any smaller value @xmath64 .",
    "thus we see that in order to investigate bsr , we just require the knowledge of @xmath68 structure function within smaller @xmath2 region .",
    "this requirement is fulfilled by using the solutions of dglap equations , which provide well description of the small-@xmath2 behaviour of @xmath0 structure function and determined the @xmath1 behaviour of bsr . when these results for bsr are compared with different experimental data @xcite and the predictions made in ref .",

    "the consistency of the results for @xmath0 and @xmath137 due to the regge like model , @xmath154 with different experimental results@xcite and other strong analysis @xcite signifies that the model is applicable in describing the small-@xmath2 behaviour of @xmath0 structure function although it being simple .",
    "moreover , in this method we do not require the knowledge of initial distributions of structure functions at all values of @xmath2 from 0 to 1 . here , we just require one input point at any fixed @xmath2 and @xmath1 and with respect to that point both the @xmath2 and @xmath1 evolution of structure functions can be obtained .",
    "our concluding impression based on all these observations is that the simple but efficient @xmath1 dependent regge ansatz for @xmath0 is capable of evolving successfully the @xmath0 structure function in accord with dglap equation at small-@xmath2 and the regge ansatz and the theoretical framework of pqcd , along with available experimental data lead towards a clean test of pqcd predictions of bjorken sum rule .",
