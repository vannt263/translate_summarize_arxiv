    "it is tacitly assumed that the large scale massless yang  mills ( ym ) fields , which could exist in the early universe before phase transitions , do not play any significant role in cosmology .",
    "partially this is related to the scale invariance of the ym lagrangian implying that primary ym excitations would be diluted during inflation .",
    "string theory suggests the born  infeld ( bi ) type modification of the ym action which breaks the scale invariance thus canceling the above objection .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable to investigate the ym cosmology with the non - abelian born - infeld action . in the existing literature",
    "one finds several papers discussing cosmological models with the u(1 ) bi matter @xcite .",
    "such models are necessarily anisotropic ( or inhomogeneous ) , since there is no homogeneous and isotropic configurations of the classical u(1 ) field .",
    "_ non - abelian _ bi ( nbi ) cosmology was not studied so far . here",
    "we investigate this problem in the framework of the traditional friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology .    a notable property of the su(2 ) yang",
    " mills field is that it _ admits _ homogeneous and isotropic ( @xmath5-invariant ) configurations .",
    "indeed , the energy can be distributed between three color components in such a way that the resulting stress - tensor is compatible with the maximal symmetry of the three - dimensional space . in the case of  @xmath6 ,",
    "the corresponding ansatz was given in @xcite , two other cases ( hyperbolic and flat ) were treated in @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of these configurations is that they produce a varying with time chern  simons density , which might lead to topological fermion non - conservation @xcite .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , in the case of the  @xmath6 spatial geometry , the ym field generically oscillates between two neighboring topological sectors of the ym theory , while the limiting unstable static solution plays a role of the cosmological sphaleron @xcite .",
    "here we do not discuss this issue further but rather concentrate on the aspects related to the scale invariance breaking in the nbi theory .",
    "an immediate consequence is that the equation of state @xmath4 arising in the usual ym theory @xcite ( mimicking the photon gas ) changes to some more complicated equation which now allows for a negative pressure .",
    "one could wonder whether an accelerating expansion becomes possible , that is , whether the sum @xmath7 can be negative .",
    "it turns out that the lower limit of acceleration which can be achieved within the present model is precisely zero : when ym field strength is much larger then the bi ` critical field ' , the equation of state is @xmath3 .",
    "such a state equation is typical for an averaged distribution of strings , where its origin is quite simple : each string has a _",
    "one - dimensional _ equation of state @xmath8 , averaging over all directions in the three - space gives @xmath3 .",
    "the deeper reason for this coincidence is not fully clear for the moment , though apparently it is related to the fact that the origin of the bi lagrangian lies in the string theory .",
    "as it was widely discussed recently @xcite , the definition of the nbi action is ambiguous .",
    "one can start with the u(1 ) bi action presented either in the determinant form @xmath9 or in the ` resolved square root ' form @xmath10 in the non - abelian case , the trace over color indices must be specified .",
    "one particular definition , suggested by tseytlin  @xcite , is a symmetrized trace .",
    "it prescribes a symmetrisation over all permutations of the gauge matrices in an expansion of the determinant in powers of the field strength before the trace is computed . inside the symmetrized series expansion ,",
    "the gauge generators effectively commute , so both the determinant and the square root forms are equivalent ( which property may serve as an alternative definition of the trace operation ) .",
    "this property does not hold for other trace prescriptions , e.g. , an ordinary trace . in this latter case",
    ", it is common to apply the trace to the square root form .",
    "note , that the string theory favors the symmetrized trace definition once lower orders of the perturbation theory are taken into account @xcite , while higher order corrections seem to violate this prescription @xcite .",
    "here we choose the ` square root / ordinary trace ' lagrangian just for its simplicity .",
    "it is worth noting that in other ( somehow related ) problem of sphalerons in the nbi theory , discussed recently both in the ordinary  @xcite and symmetrized trace  @xcite versions , basic qualitative features of the solutions turned out to be the same .",
    "we realize , however , that the distinction between different trace prescriptions may become significant near the cosmological singularity .",
    "fortunately , the dynamics of the scale factor in the su(2 ) einstein  nbi theory ( with ordinary trace ) decouples from the whole system of equations and can be fully analyzed using the dynamical systems approach .",
    "we perform this analysis for closed , spatially flat and open frw models both for zero and non - zero cosmological constants .",
    "given the solution for the scale factor , the field equations for the ym field can be integrated in terms of elliptic functions .",
    "we start with the action @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the scalar curvature , @xmath14 is the bi critical field strength , and the quantity @xmath15 corresponds to the ` square root / ordinary trace ' nbi lagrangian . throughout the paper we consider cosmological models with the homogeneous and isotropic three - space , which will be presented as usual : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is one of the functions @xmath18 , @xmath19 or @xmath20 depending on the type of the spacetime : closed , spatially flat or open ( labeled as @xmath21 correspondingly ) .    in what follows",
    ", we deal with the homogeneous and isotropic configurations of the su(2 ) ym field .",
    "although the construction of the su(2 ) ym ansatz for all frw models was discussed earlier  @xcite , it is worth to reconsider it , since in  @xcite the conformal invariance of the ym lagrangian was explicitly used . in fact , the result obtained in  @xcite was just the @xmath5-invariant connection independent of the choice of the action for the gauge field .",
    "here we rederive the @xmath5 ansatz without any appeal to the scale invariance .",
    "the homogeneous and isotropic ansatz for the ym field can be obtained starting with the witten spherically symmetric ansatz @xcite and then extending the symmetry to the full @xmath5 group .",
    "the witten ansatz reads : @xmath22 d\\theta \\nonumber\\\\              & & + \\left[(1-k_1 ) t_\\theta + k_2 t_\\phi \\right ]                      \\sin \\theta \\ , d\\phi,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where four functions @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and  @xmath26 depend on time  @xmath27 and the radial coordinate  @xmath19 ( spherical coordinates @xmath28 are understood ) , and the coordinate dependent basis in the color space is introduced as follows @xmath29 these generators satisfy the standard normalisation condition and the commutation relations @xmath30=i\\varepsilon^{abc}t_c.\\ ] ]    from four functions entering the ansatz only three are physical , while @xmath31 can be gauged away by a gauge transformation preserving the @xmath32 symmetry . in the following it is convenient to choose a parametrisation @xmath33 where a prime and a dot denote derivatives with respect to the radial variable and time .    in order to extend the symmetry to  @xmath5",

    "one can easily see that the gauge field influences the metric only through the quantity  @xmath130  ( [ rdef ] ) , related to the energy density .",
    "this quantity obeys the differential equation : @xmath131 which follows from ( [ weq ] ) and does not depend either on a detailed ym dynamics , or a particular gauge choice ( e.g. , @xmath53 , or @xmath132 ) .",

    "recalling the definition of  @xmath133  ( [ rdef ] ) , one can separate the metric and the gauge field variables as follows : @xmath136 since the right hand side of this equation is strictly positive , we can find the domain of variation of the function  @xmath65 .",

    "@xcite @xmath148 clearly , the main difference with the ordinary eym cosmology relates to small values of  @xmath59 .",
    "one can see that near the singularity ( @xmath149 ) the ym oscillations in the nbi case slow down , while in the ordinary ym cosmology the frequency remains constant in the conformal gauge @xmath132 , or tends to infinity in proper time gauge @xmath53 .",

    "in spite of considerable complications which the born  infeld non - linearity introduces to the einstein ",
    "yang  mills coupled equations , the dynamics of the frw nbi cosmology turned out to be separable and admitting a rather complete analysis in terms of the dynamical systems theory .",
    "this is due to the fact that the nbi ym equation admits a first integral expressing the variation of the energy density under cosmological evolution .",
    "thus one obtains a decoupled equation for the scale factor both without or with the cosmological constant .",
    "we have given a rather complete classification of possible solutions for closed , spatially flat , and open universes in these cases .",
    "one of the intriguing features associated with the nbi theory is the possibility of a negative pressure .",
    "namely , the pressure is negative when the field energy density exceeds the critical bi energy density .",
    "this is still insufficient to mimic an inflation , since the lowest value is only @xmath153 , which coincides with the equation of state of the gas of nambu - goto strings in three spatial dimensions . in the framework of the frw cosmology , the equation of state of the nbi ym field continuously interpolates from @xmath153 near the singularity to the ` radiation ' equation @xmath154 at large time .",
    "correspondingly , the energy density is evolving near the singularity according to the law  @xmath155 .",
    "the frw nbi universe starts with zero acceleration and achieves the tolman expansion regime , when the energy density is diluted sufficiently to make the born  infeld non - linearity negligible .",
    "once the scale factor evolution is determined , one is able to find an analytic solution for the ym function is terms of elliptic functions .",
    "qualitatively the ym dynamics remains the same as in the usual ym theory , though we have observed that near the singularity the oscillations of the ym field are damped .",
