    "the r coronae borealis ( rcb ) stars and their likely cousins the hydrogen - deficient carbon ( hdc ) stars and the extreme helium ( ehe ) stars have long posed a puzzle as to their origins in terms of stellar evolution .",
    "two leading scenarios have survived decades of theoretical and observational scrutiny . in one , the h - deficient supergiant is formed from the merger of a he white dwarf ( wd ) with a c - o white dwarf ( webbink 1984 ; iben & tutukov 1984 ; saio & jeffery 2002 ) .",
    "this path is widely referred to as the double - degenerate ( dd ) scenario . in the other ,",
    "these h - deficient stars result from a final , post - agb helium shell flash in the central star of a planetary nebula .",
    "the final flash may transform the star on the wd cooling track into a h - deficient supergiant ; this the so - called  born - again \" scenario is discussed by herwig ( 2001 ) and blcker ( 2001 ) and often labeled the ff scenario .",
    "open questions remaining include : is the dd or the ff scenario the dominant mechanism ? if both are operative , how does one distinguish a product of the dd from one of the ff scenario ?    elemental and isotopic abundances of c , n , and o are potentially powerful agents for testing the different evolutionary scenarios proposed .",
    "previous studies of the cno abundances support production of the rcbs and the ehes by the dd scenario ( pandey et al .",
    "a dramatic advance was made by clayton et al.s ( 2005 , 2007 ) discovery from medium - resolution infrared spectra of the co 2.3 @xmath7 m bands that @xmath1o was very abundant for some cool rcbs and hdcs .",
    "exploratory calculations led clayton et al .",
    "( 2007 ) to propose that @xmath1o was synthesised from @xmath4n during the merger in the dd scenario .",
    "extraordinary conditions are required for the ff scenario to lead to abundant @xmath1o .",
    "more recently , we analyzed high - resolution ( r=50,000 ) spectra of a few narrow windows in the k band of the five known hdc stars and a few rcb stars ( garca - hernndez et al .",
    "2009 ) . in these spectra ,",
    "the co spectrum is resolved and application of spectrum synthesis enables a more precise estimate of the @xmath0o/@xmath1o ratio to be obtained .",
    "our recent analysis generally confirmed reports by clayton and colleagues from r=5,900 ( or lower resolution ) spectra .",
    "we confirm that the @xmath0o/@xmath1o ratio is less than unity for those hdc stars ( 3 of the known 5 ) exhibiting co lines in their spectra .",
    "however , @xmath0o/@xmath1o=16 was obtained for the cool rcb star saps ; the other rcb stars in our sample were too warm to display co molecular lines in their spectra .",
    "our result @xmath0o/@xmath1o=16 for s aps contrasts with clayton et al .",
    "s ratio of 4 .",
    "our spectra show the gain in information resulting from the ability at the higher resolution to distinguish clearly different co isomers .",
    "high - resolution spectra are essential to derive reliable and precise oxygen isotopic ratios for these hydrogen - deficient stars .    with s aps showing a nearly 50-fold difference in the @xmath0o/@xmath1o ratio from the analysable hdc stars ,",
    "the question arises - is a higher ratio characteristic of the rcbs ?",
    "if so , this presumably provides a clue to understand the evolutionary relationship between hdc and rcb stars .",
    "unfortunately , no new information may be drawn about the oxygen isotopic ratio in hdc stars until more hdc stars are discovered , but there are several rcbs with co bands of a suitable strength not yet observed at high resolution .",
    "the example of s aps shows that rcbs should be reobserved at higher resolution before drawing conclusions about the hdc - rcb connection .",
    "therefore , we have extended high - resolution k - band observations to another five cool rcb stars in order to establish the range of the @xmath0o/@xmath1o ratio among rcbs ( clayton et al.s range from the 6 rcbs was 1 to @xmath812 ) .",
    "section 2 describes the high - resolution infrared spectroscopic observations and gives an overview of the observed spectra .",
    "our abundance analysis and the results obtained are presented in section 3 and 4 , respectively . the derived oxygen isotopic ratios are discussed in the context of the hdc - rcb connection in section 5 .",
    "final conclusions are presented in section 6 .",
    "our new sample contains six cool ( t@xmath9@xmath106250 k ) rcb stars plus one hdc star .",
    "five of these stars are observed for the first time at high resolution .",
    "the rcb star s aps and the hdc star hd 173409 were observed in spectral regions not previously covered by us ( garca - hernndez et al .",
    "high - resolution ( r@xmath250,000 ) spectroscopic observations were obtained in the period february@xmath11may 2008 with the phoenix spectrograph at gemini south ( hinkle et al .",
    "we used the 0.34 arcsec slit at grating tilts centered at 2.251 , 2.333 , 2.349 and 2.365 @xmath7 m .",
    "each one of these wavelength settings provides a spectral coverage of @xmath20.01 @xmath7 m ( or 19.5 @xmath12 ) .",
    "exposure times ranging from @xmath230 seconds ( k=5.4 ) to @xmath210 minutes ( k=8.3 ) per wavelength band were needed in order to reach a high s / n ( @xmath13100 at the continuum ) .",
    "the spectral regions covered for each star in our sample are listed in table 1 .",
    "the observed spectra were reduced to one dimension by using standard tasks in iraf and the telluric features were removed with the help of a spectrum of a hot star observed the same night .",
    "standard air wavelengths are given hereafter .    before attributing an observed spectrum to the stellar photosphere",
    ", we determine first if a star displays a significant infrared excess at 2.3 @xmath7 m . for this purpose , we constructed spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the stars in our sample by using the bvrijhkl photometry available in the literature and the iras flux density at 12 @xmath7 m . in the k band , the flux from rcb stars sv sge , s aps , wx cra and u aqr is predominantly from the photosphere ; an infrared excess from circumstellar dust does not significantly contaminate our infrared spectra .",
    "the photospheric spectrum is also dominant for the hdc star hd 173409 with an effective temperature of @xmath14 k. spectra of v cra and es aql are contaminated by infrared emission from dust .",
    "inspection of the light curve provided by the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) and the asas all star catalogue ( asas-3 ) , shows that v cra experienced a decline of at least six magnitudes beginning last march 2007 .",
    "aavso measurements are not reported for the period of our observations but the asas-3 measurements confirm that v cra was at minimum during our observations .",
    "certainly , our infrared spectra are featureless .",
    "co and cn lines are expected to be quite strong in v cra s photospheric spectrum ( @xmath15 k , asplund et al . 2000 ) and , therefore , the observed featureless spectrum is most likely from the circumstellar dust .",
    "es aql experienced a strong decline in brightness beginning in november 2007 .",
    "fortunately , es aql was recovering from minimum light when observed by us ; it was about one magnitude below maximum light according to aavso and asas-3 observations .",
    "although es aql s photospheric spectrum may be partially diluted by emission from circumstellar dust , co and cn lines are clearly detected in this star with @xmath16 k.    the observed spectral regions were chosen primarily to catch a mix of @xmath6c@xmath0o , @xmath6c@xmath1o as well as @xmath6c@xmath4n lines .",
    "the region centered at 2.251 @xmath7 m was selected in order to be able to estimate the n abundance from cn lines .",
    "the cn molecule ( red system ) contributes in all observed regions but this region is free from contributions from the first - overtone co bands . in addition , a few lines of the c@xmath17 phillips bands 0 - 2 and 1 - 3 together with some si lines cross this interval . figure 1 shows the observed spectra around 2.251 @xmath7 m for the stars in our sample .",
    "the region centered at 2.333 @xmath7 m provides a selection of p and r lines from the @xmath6c@xmath0o 2 - 0 and 3 - 1 bands as well as a few weak @xmath6c@xmath4n lines and the nai line at 2.3348 @xmath7 m .",
    "the isomer @xmath6c@xmath1o is not a contributor to this region .",
    "the observed spectra in the latter region are shown in figure 2 .",
    "three stars were also observed in the interval around 2.349 @xmath7 m .",
    "this region includes the 2 - 0 @xmath6c@xmath1o bandhead and also the 3 - 1 @xmath6c@xmath3o and 4 - 2 @xmath6c@xmath0o bandheads at 2.351 and 2.352 @xmath7 m , respectively .",
    "figure 3 shows the 2.349 @xmath7 m @xmath6c@xmath1o 2 - 0 band of three cool rcb stars in our sample in comparison with the @xmath1o - rich hdc star hd 137613 ( garca - hernndez et al .",
    "note that strong @xmath6c@xmath1o lines are seen in the spectrum of the hdc star hd 137613 , while these lines are weaker in the cool rcb stars u aqr , es aql and s aps .",
    "yet , the 4 - 2 @xmath6c@xmath0o bandhead ( and other @xmath6c@xmath0o lines ) are stronger in the rcb spectra than in the spectrum of hd 137613 .",
    "finally , all stars were observed in the region centered at 2.365 @xmath7 m .",
    "this region is well suited to providing an estimate of the @xmath0o/@xmath1o ratio because it is longward of the 2 - 0 @xmath6c@xmath1o r - branch head at 2.349 @xmath7 m and includes weak and strong @xmath6c@xmath0o and @xmath6c@xmath1o lines that are cleanly separated at r@xmath18 .",
    "there are also @xmath6c@xmath4n lines in this region .",
    "figure 4 shows the observed spectra around 2.365 @xmath7 m for the cool rcb stars in our sample .",
    "it is clear that the rcb star wx cra is strongly enriched in @xmath1o because lines of @xmath6c@xmath0o and @xmath6c@xmath1o are similar in strength , as anticipated from medium - resolution spectra ( clayton et al . 2007 ) . in contrast , the @xmath6c@xmath1o lines - especially the cleanest @xmath6c@xmath1o line at @xmath22.3686 @xmath7 m is much weaker in the other four rcb stars , suggesting that @xmath1o is less abundant in these stars .",
    "we derive oxygen isotopic abundances by using spectral synthesis techniques . a detailed description of the adopted abundance analysis procedure as well as the input physics and atomic and molecular linelists has been presented by us ( garca - hernndez et al . 2009 ) and will not be repeated here . in short ,",
    "we have constructed h - deficient spherically symmetric marcs model atmospheres for the stars in our sample and we considered up - to - date lists of atomic and molecular lines .",
    "the most important contributor of lines in our spectral regions are the co and cn molecules .",

    "the only exception with respect to initial composition was u aqr ( see below ) for which we have also used a metal - poor model with [ fe / h]=@xmath111.0 dex .",
    "the turbospectrum package ( alvarez & plez 1998 ) , which is compatible with marcs , is used to generate the corresponding synthetic spectra .    apart from the adopted input composition , a microturbulent velocity , surface gravity and effective temperature must be chosen .",
    "the warm rcb stars display an average microturbulent velocity of 6.6 km s@xmath24 with no apparent trend with effective temperature ( asplund et al .",
    "thus , we assumed a microturbulence of 7 km s@xmath24 for all rcb stars .",
    "this value provides a fair fit to both the weaker and strong lines of a given species , a necessary condition according to the definition of microturbulence .",
    "when a synthetic spectrum computed for a microturbulence of 7 km s@xmath24 is convolved with a gaussian profile with a width of 6 km s@xmath24 in order to take into account the instrumental profile at r@xmath2550,000 , a good fit is obtained to the line profiles .",
    "this suggests that the macroturbulence is small .",
    "in addition , a surface gravity of @xmath26g@xmath27 was assumed in the construction of the model atmospheres for all rcb stars .",

    "then , it might be metal - poor",
    ". there is spectroscopic evidence for this and for a lower effective temperature ( rao 2008 ) .",
    "thus , for u aqr we consider a model with @xmath31 k and a metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] = -1 ) model with @xmath32 k.    the corresponding synthetic spectra were compared to the observed ones in order to determine the isotopic ratios for o and n - see garca - hernndez et al .",

    "it should be noted here that the listed o , n , na , and s elemental abundances must be considered with caution because they are strongly dependent of the atmospheric parameters ( table 2 ) . the formal error in the total n and o abundances taking into account variations of the atmospheric parameters used in the modeling of hydrogen - deficient stars are estimated to be of the order of 0.3@xmath110.4 dex ( garca - hernndez et al . 2009 ) .",

    "given the extreme rarity of hdc and rcb stars , it seems reasonable to suppose that they are closely related . here",
    ", we adopt the view that both are products of the dd scenario in which a he white dwarf merges with a c - o white dwarf .",
    "the merger inflates the resultant atmosphere around the c - o white dwarf to supergiant dimensions .",

    "although it is plausible that the @xmath1o is synthesized from @xmath4n ( warner 1967 ) , no explanation has yet been provided as to why the @xmath0o/@xmath1o ratio takes the low values seen in the hdcs and why surviving @xmath4n seems so slightly depleted .",

    "the c abundance is assumed to be the same for all stars ( see table 2 ) .",
    "these differences are unlikely to be attributable to systematic differences in atmospheric parameters between the hdc and rcb stars ; the differences on average are slight except , perhaps , for the c / he ratio which is an assumed not a derived parameter ( see below for our conjecture about this ratio ) .",
    "the most striking difference between hdc and rcb stars is seen among the estimates of the @xmath0o/@xmath1o ratios .",
    "the three hdcs for which the ratio is measureable have an isotopic ratio near 0.5 .",
    "three of the four rcbs with a measured isotopic ratio have a ratio at least one order of magnitude higher than that seen in the hdcs .",
    "the exception is the rcb wx cra which has an hdc - like ratio .",
    "it bears repeating ( see table 2 ) that the measured @xmath0o/@xmath1o ratio is insensitive to the adopted model atmosphere over quite wide variations of the model atmosphere parameters .",
    "furthermore , this hdc - rcb difference is evident from inspection of the spectra .    in order to interpret this clear difference in the @xmath0o/@xmath1o ratio between hdc and rcb stars it is helpful to know the contributions from an increase in the @xmath0o and a decrease in the @xmath1o abundance between the two groups of stars .",
    "the @xmath0o and @xmath1o abundances are given in table 3 and shown in figure 11 .",
    "one interpretation of the abundances is that the difference in @xmath0o/@xmath1o ratios may be partially attributable to decrease in @xmath1o abundances between the @xmath1o - rich hdc stars ( and wx cra ) but primarily arises from an increase in the @xmath0o abundance between hdc and rcb stars .",
    "( the lower than average @xmath0o and @xmath1o abundances for es aql among the rcbs may possibly be due to the uncertain and varying dilution of the spectrum by dust emission . )    here , we do not attempt to explain the origin of the @xmath1o that is such a remarkable characteristic of the hdc - see clayton et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and our 2009 paper for speculations . in this section",
    ", we directly speculate to how the differences in composition between hdc and rcb stars may be related to the dredge - up of nuclear - processed material by the supergiant as it evolves from a hdc to a rcb star .",
    "published calculations bounding the possibilities have yet to be reported .",
    "our speculations draw on the few models presented by saio & jeffery ( 2002 ) for mergers in which mass transfer is a slow process continuing well into the supergiant phase . in these models ,",
    "the convective envelope just prior to the rapid evolution back to high temperatures makes a close approach to the he - burning shell .",
    "( this close approach may not occur in the case of a merger which results in traces of hydrogen in the accreted material and then the maintenance of a h - burning shell in the supergiant . )    with a close approach to the he - burning shell , the @xmath0o in the envelope may increase .",
    "such an increase is more certain to occur , if after the cessation of he - burning , the convective envelope is able to penetrate to the he - shell / co - core boundary .",
    "also , the @xmath1o abundance is likely to decrease because it may have been destroyed in the deepest layers ; @xmath1o is more prone to @xmath38 destruction than @xmath0o by several orders of magnitude .",
    "a few per cent addition of mass from the he - exhausted layers should suffice to increase the @xmath0o abundance by an order of magnitude .",
    "in this scenario , the @xmath6c abundance of the envelope and atmosphere increases too between hdc and rcb stars because the ratio of @xmath6c/@xmath0o in the he - exhausted layers is most likely to be greater than one .",
    "the he abundance should not be significantly changed by the extension of the deep convective envelope across the he - shell / c - o - core boundary .",
    "thus , the rcbs may have a higher c / he ratio than the hdcs .",
    "this may account also for an intriguing difference in na and s abundances between hdc and rcb stars in table 3 . both s and na are about 0.6 dex higher in hdcs than in the rcbs .",
    "derived abundances are dependent on the assumed c / he ratio . in the infrared he@xmath39 free - free opacity",
    "is the leading contributor of continuous opacity with c as an important electron donor . in our previous paper",
    ", we reported that a change in the c / he ratio from 1% to 10% lead to an increase of na and s abundances by about 0.6 dex .",
    "this suggests that decreasing the c / he ratio to about 0.1% will reduce the na and s abundances to about their levels seen in the rcb stars .",
    "derived abundances for n and o change little with a change in c / he ratio .",
    "the c / he ratio of 1% for the hdcs and rcbs is an assumed value .",
    "a change of the c / he ratio from 0.1% to 1% to reconcile na and s abundances in hdc with values for rcbs is possibly consistent with the c / o ratio of material dredged - up from the he - exhausted layers .",
    "although this scenario offers a scheme for accounting for the lowering of the @xmath0o/@xmath1o ratio between hdc and rcb stars and also for the difference in their abundances of na and s , it augments the challenge in accounting for the compositions of the warm rcbs ( and ehes ) for which detailed results are available ( asplund et al . 2000 ; pandey et al .",
    "if the rcbs are affected by a late dredge - up , one would suppose that the final c / he must vary from star to star on account of the different amounts of mass dredged up and the different c / o ratios .",
    "such a variation would be reflected in star - to - star variations in abundances when all stars are analysed assuming the same c / he ratio . yet , the abundances of elements heavier than o are quite similar star - to - star across the sample of majority rcbs .",
    "the dispersion including the measurement uncertainties is only about 0.2 dex for well observed elements over the sample of 14 warm rcbs .",
    "the challenge in accounting for the uniform compositions was not created by incorporating a late dredge - up into the evolution of these h - deficient supergiants .",
    "its origin surely lies in the dd scenario itself .",
    "mergers of he white dwarfs with c - o white dwarfs spanning a range in masses and previous histories of the white dwarfs might be expected to result in h - deficient stars with quite different c / he ratios and metallicities .",
    "one looks forward to detailed modelling of h - deficient supergiants that will test our conjecture about a late dredge - up of material from he - exhausted layers .",
    "challenges are not a new phenomenon to students of the r coronae borealis stars .",
    "high - resolution infared spectroscopy promises to provide responses to some of the key challenges regarding the rcbs and their putative relatives the hdc and ehe stars . here , we suggested an evolutionary link between the hdcs and the rcbs involving the dredge - up of material to the surface .",
    "further exploration of the link is possible .",
    "unfortunately , the list of known hdcs has been exhausted .",
    "a few cool rcbs remain to be observed in the k band at high resolution . of these ,",
    "the most critical is v cra .",
    "unfortunately , our observations were obtained when the star was at minimum and infrared emission came from the dust shell and not the stellar photosphere .",
    "v cra is special target because it is one of four known minority rcb stars ( rao & lambert 1994 ) and the only one likely to show co lines .",
    "minority rcbs are distinguished by their high s / fe and si / fe ratios ( among other abundance anomalies ) : v cra has [ si / fe ] @xmath40 [ s / fe ] @xmath40 2 ( asplund et al . 2000 ; rao & lambert 2008 ) .",
    "additionally , v cra is rich in @xmath33c with @xmath6c/@xmath33c @xmath41 ( rao & lambert 2008 ) . among those hdc and rcbs for which the carbon isotopic ratio may be estimated ,",
    "v cra is the only known example with a high @xmath33c abundance . what does the combination of anomalous abundance ratios and high @xmath33c abundance imply about the origin of v cra and minority rcbs",
    "? is their origin a variant of the dd scenario or must another ( i.e. , the ff ) scenario be invoked ?",
    "measurement of the oxygen isotopic ratios is potentially a valuable clue to the answers to these questions .",
    "infrared spectroscopy offers the possibility of probing the carbon problems posed by the rcbs and hdcs - see asplund et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and garca - hernndez et al .",
    "( 2009 ) - in the failure to account for the strengths of the atomic and molecular carbon lines .",
    "from the optical to the infrared , the leading contributor to the continuous opacity depending on the star s effective temperature may change from the photoionization of neutral carbon to free - free absorption from neutral helium .",
    "full spectral coverage at high spectral resolution from the optical through at least the k band offers a novel opportunity to probe and hopefully to resolve the carbon problems . with their resolution , the chemical compositions of these fascinating h - deficient stars should be on a firmer footing and insights gained into their origins .",
