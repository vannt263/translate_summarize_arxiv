    "the hallmark of two dimensional ( 2d ) tis is the emergence of a pair of metallic edge states on the boundaries of the system , where electrons with opposite spin polarization propagate in opposite directions ( the so - called spin - momentum locking ) .",
    "helical edge states , as they are referred to , are topologically protected against backscattering , as long as time - reversal symmetry is preserved . as a consequence ,",
    "transport along edge states occurs in the ballistic regime and conductance is perfectly quantized .",

    "thermal manipulation of the spin degree of freedom is relevant to improve spin - based devices , which are believed to be faster and less consuming with respect to their electronic counterparts @xcite .",
    "spin thermoelectrics has been recently invigorated by the direct observation of spin seebeck @xcite , peltier @xcite and seebeck spin tunneling @xcite effects in magnetic systems . in graphene tunnel junction ,",

    "is expected to be generated in a cross - terminal setup by overlapping of edges state due to finite size effects @xcite .",
    "+ in principle , the linear dispersion relation of edge states in tis , satisfying particle - hole symmetry , would prevent any thermoelectric response of edge states . in order to recover thermoelectric effects , previous work proposed to introduce a truncation in the dispersion relation @xcite , open a gap @xcite , exploit the strong energy - dependence of the lifetime of edge states @xcite or introduce a spin - dependent backscattering region through the coupling with an anti - dot @xcite . also , the combined effects of tunneling and quantum interference in a multiple quantum point contact ( qpc ) geometry give rise to an energy - dependent transmission amplitude in qhss , which effectively breaks particle - hole symmetry introducing a thermoelectric response @xcite .",
    "this result is related to topological protection , which guarantees phase - coherent transport regime , allowing for observation of wave - like effects such as quantum interference .",

    "we demonstrate that the contribution of spin - flipping tunneling to spin transport in a two terminal configuration is dramatically modified by the introduction of interactions .",

    "a longitudinal thermoelectric spin current is generated in response to a thermal gradient in the non linear regime through spin - flipping tunneling .",

    "we consider two gate voltages @xmath31 capacitively coupled to the top and bottom edges to shift the fermi momenta @xmath32 thus effectively modifying the dynamical phase acquired by the propagating electrons .",
    "we are interested in studying whether a thermal gradient @xmath33 is able to induce charge @xmath34 and spin @xmath35 currents flowing along the edges of the system . in the absence of tunneling ,",
    "spin current @xmath35 is zero in a two terminal configuration due to symmetry constraints . the same occurs for charge current @xmath34 , because particle - hole symmetry is preserved and prevents any thermoelectric effect due to a thermal gradient . in the following we investigate the generation of thermoelectric currents in the presence of interedge tunneling .",
    "we thus define charge and spin current operators as ( @xmath36 ) @xmath37 which , by virtue of particle number conservation , can be recast in the form @xmath38 since we are interested in evaluating the expectation value of eqs .  - , it is useful to express them in terms of fermionic operators @xmath39 it is worth noting that charge current is unaffected by @xmath24-tunneling processes .",

    "contrary to energy , momentum is not conserved during tunneling because of the breaking of translational invariance . assuming that an electron with energy @xmath45 tunnels from the top to the bottom edge , the transferred momentum will be @xmath46 and it depends on the energy @xmath45 .",

    "indeed , the transferred momentum appears exclusively in the electronic phases , which affect transmission amplitude solely in the presence of quantum interference effects .",

    "[ fig : two](b ) we show such processes , where electrons tunneling between the two edges change their spin components but not their chiralities . looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : two](b ) one can argue that energy conserving processes all transfer the same momentum , and therefore transmission amplitude @xmath41 is not energy dependent .",

    "a @xmath48 excitation can reach the right reservoir either remaining on its channel or by tunneling via @xmath24-process , changing its spin component into @xmath49 .",

    "a similar argument holds true also for @xmath49 and @xmath54 electrons , whose expectation values are @xmath55 . by means of definitions",
    "and we see that longitudinal spin current @xmath35 is zero , while charge current can be written as @xmath56.\\ ] ] although breaking of particle - hole symmetry due to tunneling is able to generate charge thermoelectric effects , the spin sector remains insensitive to the thermal gradient because of symmetry considerations .",
    "+ in the following we will show that electron - electron interactions can radically modify this picture .",
    "recently , evidence of electron interactions at the edge of the 2d ti inas / gasb has been reported  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : two](b ) , in the non - interacting case ( @xmath71 ) the final energy of the @xmath44 electron is fixed and correspond to the incoming one of @xmath42 electron . in that case , processes in which the @xmath72 electron has lower energy than the @xmath73 one are not allowed . on the contrary , in the interacting case ( @xmath74 ) such processes exist , due to the peculiar broadening of the energy spectrum of helical luttinger liquids @xcite .",
    "for these processes a @xmath42 electron tunnels into the @xmath44 channel , losing a certain amount of energy and creating a particle - hole excitation in the @xmath43 channel .",
    "the missing energy is stored into the particle - hole contribution in the opposite channel .",
    "the creation of such particle - hole excitations is due to the peculiar form of the interaction , and in particular to the term of inter - channel density - density interactions , proportional to @xmath60 @xcite . +",
    "each tunneling event of the type described above is associated with a finite energy - dependent transferred momentum .",
    "therefore , because of the spectral function broadening of the linear dispersing edge states in the presence of interactions , @xmath24-events can depend on the energy at which tunneling occurs .",
    "+ furthermore , let us notice that tunneling of a @xmath42 electron induces a finite transferred momentum on each branch of the bottom edge , in the presence of interactions .",
    "this means that a single @xmath24-tunneling event induces both a forward and a backward scattering , in contrast to the same process in the non - interacting case . as a consequence ,",
    "it is no longer true that charge and spin are transferred from one reservoir to the other independently of @xmath24-tunneling . + from these considerations , we predict that electron interactions dramatically affect the thermoelectric charge and spin response .",
    "in particular , we will show that the interactions - induced energy dependence of @xmath24-processes can lead to a thermally driven spin current .",
