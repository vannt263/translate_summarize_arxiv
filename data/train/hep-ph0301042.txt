    "recently kamland presented the first results @xcite on the search for oscillation of @xmath3 emitted from distant power reactors .",
    "electron antineutrinos are detected by means of inverse beta decay , @xmath4 by looking at the prompt energy deposited by the positron ( @xmath5 , where the kinetic energy of the positron is @xmath6 ) accompanied by the signal of the neutron from @xmath7 . with an exposure of 162 ton@xmath8yr",
    "a clear deficit has been observed , however various combinations of oscillation parameters describe well the shape of the positron spectrum . the best fit value reported in @xcite , including the geo - neutrino fluxes as free parameters , corresponds to @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "terrestrial antineutrinos , emitted by the @xmath11-decay of the progenies of @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the earth s interior , contribute to the low energy part of the detected signal , the maximal @xmath14 being 2.48 and 1.46 mev respectively . from a fit to the experimental data the kamland collaboration reported 4 events associated to @xmath12 and 5 to @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "these numbers provide a direct insight on the radiogenic component of the terrestrial heat . in this paper",
    "we comment on the implications of this first result and on the prospects which it discloses for understanding the energetics of the earth .",
    "we also discuss the constraints provided by geo - neutrinos for precise determinations of the neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "given the cross section of ( [ eqdecay ] ) and the antineutrino spectra one can immediately derive the relationship between the number of events and the antineutrino fluxes ( see appendix ) : @xmath15 where event numbers @xmath16 are calculated for an exposure of @xmath17 protons@xmath8yr , @xmath18 is the averaged survival probability and @xmath19 are the detection efficiencies ( from the values quoted in @xcite , we get @xmath20 and @xmath21 for both @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "@xmath24 are the fluxes in units of @xmath25 , i.e. the fluxes which one should observe in the absence of oscillation : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the detector location , @xmath28 is the density , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the concentration , lifetime and atomic mass of element @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the number of antineutrinos emitted per decay chain .",
    "the integration is performed over the earth volume @xmath34 .",
    "the radiogenic contribution to the terrestrial heat is not quantitatively understood . in ref .",
    "@xcite three representative models have been considered :    \\a ) a naive chondritic model , where one assumes for the earth mass ratios typical of carbonaceous chondrites @xcite : @xmath35/[u]= 3.8 $ ] , @xmath36/[u]=7\\cdot 10 ^ 4 $ ] and @xmath37/[si ] = 7.3\\cdot10^{-8}$ ] . in this model",
    "the radiogenic heat production rate is about @xmath38 , originating mainly from @xmath39 decays .",
    "\\b ) the bulk silicate earth ( bse ) model , which provides a description of geological evidence coherent with geochemical information and accounts for a radiogenic production of about @xmath40 . in this model",
    "one has : @xmath35/[u]=3.8 $ ] , @xmath36/[u]=10 ^ 4 $ ] and @xmath37/[si]= 9.4\\cdot10^{-8}$ ] .",
    "\\c ) a fully radiogenic model , where the abundances of @xmath41 and @xmath39 are rescaled with respect to b ) so as to account for the full terrestrial heat flow of @xmath42 .    uranium mass in the crust",
    "@xmath43 has been fixed . by taking @xmath44 all other masses in the crust and in the mantle",
    "are obtained from the above ratios .",
    "uniform distributions within the crust and the mantle are assumed . for each model , from the fluxes of ref .",
    "@xcite and eqs .",
    "( [ eqnu],[eqnth ] ) we obtain the number of events expected in the first exposure of kamland , see table [ tabevents ] .    in view of the limited statistics ,",
    "it is useful to consider the sum of terrestrial events @xmath45 .",
    "the measured value is essentially obtained from a total of @xmath46 counts with @xmath47 , after subtraction of reactor events @xmath48 and background @xmath49 : @xmath50 .",
    "the statistical fluctuation is thus of order @xmath51 . within this uncertainty all models are consistent with data , the fully radiogenic model being closer to the value reported in @xcite .",
    "we remark that the ratio @xmath52 is a significant indicator .",
    "in fact , the separate event numbers depend on the amount of radioactive materials , on their distribution inside the earth , on the antineutrinos survival probability and on the detection efficiency . on the other hand ,",
    "if one assumes an approximately uniform mass ratio @xmath35/[u]$ ] inside the earth , the event ratio does not depend on material distribution and on the survival probability , as it is clear from eq .",

    "however , a model with @xmath35/[u]=16 $ ] , @xmath36/[u]=10 ^ 4 $ ] and @xmath59 would provide the full observed heat flow , the main source being @xmath23 at 28 tw .",
    "the model predicts about 5 events in kamland , half from @xmath23 and half from @xmath22 decays .    in order to discuss the achievable improvements ,",
    "we collect in table  [ tabconf ] the predictions of several models , normalized to @xmath17 protons@xmath8yr  ) and assuming 100% detection efficiency .",
    "we present the results following from @xcite , together with predictions obtained from the fluxes estimated in @xcite and some estimates from @xcite , rescaled for a 0.55 survival probability ( model iib of @xcite assumes that heat production is fully sustained by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , omitting any contribution from potassium ) . from the various models ,",
    "one estimates @xmath60 events in the range 24 - 83 respectively .    at a site with negligible reactor flux @xmath61",
    "could thus be measured with an accuracy of about 20 - 10% and the different models could be clearly discriminated . on the other hand , by rescaling the present kamland data , one expects that counts with @xmath62 will be @xmath63 .",
    "this implies statistical fluctuations of about @xmath64 events , which possibly will allow for a clear evidence of geo - neutrinos , however they are too large for model discrimination .",
    "all this calls for a detector with the class and the size of kamland , far away from nuclear reactors .",
    "we note that borexino @xcite will provide additional and complementary information in the future .",
    "its target mass is about 300 tons and the reactor background corresponds to about 7 events per year below @xmath65 , thus providing a better signal to background ratio @xcite .",
    "when kamland data at @xmath66 are combined with solar and chooz data , the solution to the solar neutrino problems is basically split in two near regions , called lma - i and lma - ii @xcite .",
    "the first region contains the global best fit point , corresponding to @xmath67 , whereas the second one is centered around @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "a relevant question is thus if geo - neutrinos can be of some help for discriminating between the two solutions .",
    "as previously remarked , although the total amounts of @xmath22 and @xmath23 inside earth are not well determined , the ratio of their abundances is rather constrained .",
    "estimates for the solar system yield @xmath35/[u]=(3.7 - 3.9)$ ] @xcite , estimates for the primitive mantle are in the range @xmath69 , measurements of the upper continental crust give @xmath70 , estimates of the bulk continental crust are in the range @xmath71 @xcite . by assuming @xmath35/[u]=3.8 \\pm 0.7 $ ] , from eq .",
    "( [ eqrappo ] ) we get for the ratio of geo - events : @xmath72    we remark that this constraint , which has been derived by assuming an approximately uniform distribution of @xmath35/[u]$ ] and equal ( distance averaged ) survival probabibilities , has actually a larger validity .",
    "concerning the effect of regional @xmath35/[u]$ ] variations , from @xcite we derive that @xmath73 is changed by less than 2% when the detector is placed at kamioka , or gran sasso , or tibet ( on the top of a very thick continental crust ) or at the hawaii ( sitting on the thin , @xmath22- and @xmath23-poor oceanic crust ) .",
    "coming to the effect of local variations , by assuming that within 100 @xmath74 from the detector the uranium abundance is double , [ th]/[u]=2 , one gets @xmath75 , whereas if its is halved , @xmath35/[u]=8 $ ] , one finds @xmath76 .",
    "neutrino oscillations clearly do not affect eq .",
    "( [ rapporti ] ) if the oscillation lenghts for both @xmath22 and @xmath23 neutrinos are both very short or very long in comparison with some typical earth dimension .",
    "we have checked that the effect of finite oscillation lengths does not change @xmath73 by more than 2 in conclusion , all these effects are well within the estimated 20% uncertainty on @xmath73 .      in order to see the implications of this constraint ,",
    "let us first divide the kamland signal below @xmath77 in two regions : a ) @xmath78 corresponding to the first two bins of @xcite and b ) @xmath79 , corresponding to the next two bins .",
    "all @xmath23-events are contained in region a ) , whereas a fraction @xmath80 of @xmath22 events are in a ) and in @xmath81 are in b ) .",
    "we find @xmath82 .",
    "the number of geo - events @xmath83 in each region is thus : @xmath84 by eliminating @xmath57 from the two equations one obtains a sum rule : @xmath85    for each solution , we can extract @xmath83 from kamland counts @xmath86 , after subtracting the estimated background @xmath87 and the predicted reactor events @xmath88 .",
    "one can then build the quantity @xmath89 and check if it is consistent with zero .",
    "we remark that @xmath90 are essentially independent observables and the statistical fluctuations are not correlated .",
    "this procedure is shown in table [ table3 ] for the best fit points of lma - i and lma - ii  .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath91 , calculated for @xmath92 and @xmath82 , @xmath93 show that both solutions are consistent with the sum rule .",
    "the constraint ( [ sum ] ) , which is practically unaffected if @xmath73 is varied within its assumed @xmath94 uncertainty , will become relevant when more data are available .",
    "in addition to the algebraic approach described above , we performed a fit to the entire positron spectrum ( @xmath95 ) including the geo - neutrino contribution with @xmath35/[u]$ ] fixed at 3.8 .",
    "the fitting function includes then the reactor fluxes of the 16 main contributing power plants , as well as the geo - neutrino spectrum of @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite convoluted with the kamland energy resolution of 7.5%/@xmath96 .",
    "only the 5 first bins have a non - zero geo - neutrino contribution .",
    "according to @xcite we included 2.9 background events ; since the exact background distribution has not been published , we added 2 of them into bin 1 and 0.3 into bin 2 , 3 and 4 respectively .",
    "we renormalised the no - oscillation spectrum to 86.9 events for @xmath97 in order to match the kamland integrated exposure .",
    "this leads to about @xmath98 expected reactor events for @xmath99 in the absence of oscillations .",
    "it is worth noting that in addition to the error of the overall normalisation ( 5.6 events ) , the lack of knowledge of the individual running time of the reactors adds another systematic error that we do not take into account .",
    "the @xmath100 function is taken as in @xcite which accounts for bins with low statistics .",
    "fitting of the kamland spectrum leads to two main minima which we label low - lma and high - lma ) + chooz + solar data , we refer to low - lma and high - lma when considering the energy spectrum of kamland . ] .",
    "both solutions remain stable when increasing the threshold to @xmath101 ; the best fit values do shift only slightly when including the additional geo - neutrino information .",
    "the detailed results of the fit are given in table [ table4 ] and displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "the best fit is obtained for the low - lma solution ( @xmath102 ) and the corresponding geo - neutrino contribution @xmath45 is found to be @xmath103 .",
    "the high - lma solution is allowed at a one sigma level with @xmath104 and @xmath45 is @xmath105 .",
    "this result can be compared with 9 events obtained in @xcite .",
    "we applied the algebraic method described in the previous section using the low - lma and high - lma solutions , and find @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "this shows that the sum rule can be applied to check the consistency of the data and the geo - neutrino predictions .",
    "finally we compare the constraints on oscillation parameters obtained from the analysis with @xmath101 and @xmath95 . in the latter case",
    "we include geo - neutrinos with the ratio @xmath35/[u]$ ] fixed at 3.8 and background as described above .",
    "we calculate the values of @xmath100 in the 3-dimensional parameter space @xmath108 $ ] . to obtain the 95% c.l . for the subspace of interest",
    ", we then project the volumes which satisfy @xmath109 ( joint estimation of 2 parameters ) onto the @xmath110 $ ] plane @xcite .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the 95% contour lines of the full spectral analysis together with the contours obtained for @xmath101 .",
    "the latter is in good agreement with @xcite , however we remark that our 90% c.l .",
    "contour is closer to their 95% c.l ..    even with the present limited statistics , the full spectral analysis further reduces the allowed oscillation parameter space compared to the analysis with @xmath101 .",
    "we expect that with an increased statistics in the future , a full spectral analysis including geo - neutrinos will provide a severe consistency check of the data and moreover can help to break the degeneracy among the solutions , in particular , if a high - lma solutions @xcite were realized in nature .",
