    "in the 1970s many - body theory flourished .",
    "a topic that attracted much attention was the many - body effects on xps ( x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ) spectra , from deep core levels in metals@xcite .",
    "related effects were singularities that appeared near edges in absorption and emission spectra@xcite .",
    "the cb ( conduction - band ) electrons can have many different effects on the xps peak from the core level . if the excitation could be considered adiabatic the screening of the core hole by the cb electrons would lead to a shift of the peak to higher kinetic energy ( lower binding energy of the core level ) .",
    "now the excitation is not adiabatic , the excitation is swift .",
    "the excitation frequency is large compared to the frequency components taking part in the screening of the core hole .",
    "this has the effect that the cb electrons are shaken up and are left in a nonequilibrium state .",
    "this is analogous to the following case : assume that a cork is floating in a glass of water .",
    "if we remove the cork very slowly the water will be left very quiet and without any ripples .",
    "if we on the other hand remove it very briskly the water will be left in an upset state with many surface waves excited . in a metal",
    "the water waves correspond to plasmons , collective excitations of the cb electrons .",
    "the shake - up effects will show up as plasmon replicas in the spectrum ; the main peak will be at the adiabatic position ; the first replica , a smaller copy of the main peak , will be at a shifted position to lower kinetic energy where the shift is equal to the plasma frequency ; the second replica is even smaller and shifted with two plasma frequencies ; this goes on until further peaks are absorbed by the background .",
    "the main peak corresponds to the system left in quasi equilibrium(fully equilibrium would demand that the core hole were filled by one of the electrons ) , the second to a state where one plasmon is excited , the third to a state where two plasmons are excited and so on .",
    "since all plasmons do not have identical energies , the plasmon curve shows dispersion , the replicas are not completely identical smaller versions of the main peak .    in a metal also",
    "single - particle excitations can take place .",
    "these electron - hole pair excitations form a continuum , starting from zero frequency and upwards .",
    "these excitations lead to a deformation , including a low - energy tail , of both the main peak and the plasmon replicas .",
    "furthermore the finite life - time of the core hole causes a lorentzian broadening of all peaks and experimental uncertainties give a gaussian broadening .",
    "the low - energy tailing is a characteristic of a metallic system , i.e. a system where the chemical potential is inside an energy band and not in a band - gap , and can e.g. be used by experimentalists to find out where in a complex sample the core hole is situated .",
    "several parameters were introduced by doniach and sunji@xcite to characterize the xps line shapes and are still broadly used by experimentalists in the fitting procedure for xps spectra .    in the present work we address pristine and doped graphene . in the pristine case",
    "the chemical potential is neither inside an energy band nor in a band - gap .",
    "the fermi surface is just two points in the brillouin zone .",
    "this makes this system special .",
    "as we will see there is still a low - energy tailing . in the doped case",
    "the chemical potential is inside an energy band and we would expect to find , and find , a tailing .",
    "however , the 2d ( two - dimensional ) character of the system means that the collective excitations are 2d plasmons with a completely different dispersion than in the ordinary 3d metallic systems .",
    "the 2d plasmons give contributions that start already from zero frequency and upwards .",
    "this means that they contribute to the tail and no distinct plasmon replicas are distinguishable .",
    "making any quantitative interpretation of graphene core - hole spectra using doniach and sunji fitting of the spectra is not feasible .",
    "it is more reasonable to calculate the spectra .",
    "one purpose of this work is to provide the reader with the tools needed for such a calculation .",
    "the material is organized in the following way : in sec . [",
    "the ] we show how the core - hole spectra are derived for a 2d system .",
    "the results and comparison with experimental spectra are presented in sec .",
    "finally , we end with a brief summary and conclusion section , sec .",
    "we use a model that is based on the one used by langreth@xcite for the core - hole problem in the 1970s and here modified and extended to fit our problem .",
    "we have earlier@xcite with success used another modified version for the problem of exciton annihilation in quantum wells .    in the excitation process",
    "the photoelectron leaves the system and a core hole is left behind .",
    "the shape of the xps spectrum depends on how fast the process is .",
    "if it is very slow one may use the adiabatic approximation in which one assumes that the electrons in the system have time to relax around the core hole during the process .",
    "when we derive the xps line shape we assume that the excitation process is very fast ; we use the sudden approximation in which the core - hole potential is turned on instantaneously .",
    "the electrons have not time , during the process , to settle down and reach equilibrium in the potential from the core hole .",
    "this results in shake - up effects in the form of single particle ( electron - hole pair ) excitations and collective ( plasmon ) excitations .",
    "the electrons contributing to the shake - up effects are the electrons in the valence and conduction bands . from here on we refer to them as the electrons .",
    "we use the assumption that the core hole does not recoil in the shake - up process and that there are no excitations within the core .",
    "we approximate the core - hole potential with a pure coulomb potential .",
    "the following model hamiltonian for the system is used : @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are the core - hole energy , the creation operator for the core hole , the annihilation operator for the core hole , the interaction potential for the interaction between the core hole and the electrons , and the hamiltonian for the electrons , respectively .",
    "the operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 contain creation and annihilation operators for the electrons and no core - hole operators .",

    "there is no core hole and the electrons are in their ground state .",

    "we have made use of the general relation @xmath22}}$ ] , for operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and that the core - hole number operator commutes with all terms of the hamiltonian .",
    "it is now time to define our @xmath4 and the rest of the hamiltonian .",
    "the excitation spectrum of the electrons is given by the dynamical structure factor , which is related to the dielectric function according to @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the 2d fourier transform of the coulomb potential .",
    "the structure factor is nonzero in two regions ; one region is where electron - hole pairs are excited ; the other is on the plasmon dispersion curve .",
    "all these excitations are bosons .",
    "we assume that the bosons are independent .",
    "let us for simplicity start by assuming that the bosons have a distinct dispersion curve , @xmath27 .",
    "this is the case for plasmons and phonons .",
    "later we will generalize this to include contributions from the electron - hole pair continuum .",
    "we now get the following hamiltonian : @xmath28 where @xmath23 is the area of the 2d system and @xmath29 the coupling constant between the core hole and the boson excitation .",
    "the operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 are boson creation and annihilation operators , respectively , obeying the commutation relation @xmath32 = { \\delta _ { { \\bf{q}},{\\bf{q}}'}}$ ] and @xmath33 are the density operators , where @xmath34 denotes the position of the core hole . we treat the core hole as a classical particle , i.e. , the core - hole operators are c - numbers .",
    "this is why the density operators do not contain any creation and/or annihilation operators .",
    "let us here take the opportunity to derive the results using the adiabatic approximation .",
    "since there is no kinetic energy terms for the core hole the hamiltonian can be diagonalized .",

    "we subtracted a linear background from both experimental sets of data and used the same broadening parameters for both spectra .",
    "the main peak in the doped sample is broader than in the undoped but this extra broadening comes from different shake - up effects in the two samples .",

    "we have here removed all different shifts , @xmath80 , for the curves .",

    "the red dashed curve is the pristine result .",
    "the blue short - dashed curve is for the doping density @xmath110 , and the green dotted curve from a sheet with doping concentration @xmath111 .",
    "important doping effects show up first at doping concentrations exceeding @xmath112 .",
    "the reason is that some electron - hole - pair excitation - channels are blocked with doping due to the pauli exclusion principle ; this is compensated by new electron - hole - pair excitation - channels and the new plasmon - excitation channel .    in a recent work@xcite one came to the same conclusion as we regarding the need to make a full calculation of the core - hole spectra in graphene instead of using the doniach and sunji fitting of the peaks .",
    "they treated the band - structure of graphene in a different way compared to our and relied on density functional theory .",
    "they seem to have assumed a constant 2d plasmon frequency and thereby obtained sharp plasmon structures in the tail region of the peaks .",
    "such structures are not observed in the experimental spectra .",
    "to summarize , we have presented a detailed derivation of the core - level spectra of 2d systems and presented numerical results for pristine and doped free - standing graphene .",
    "although , pristine graphene is not a metal its core - level spectrum shows a peak tailing , characteristic of metallic systems . the tailing increases with doping for doping concentrations exceeding @xmath112 .",
    "the peak shape changes with further increase of the doping concentration .",
    "this opens up for a complementary way to estimate the degree of doping of a sample .",
    "we have compared our results to three different experimental spectra from two experimental groups .",
    "the agreement is quite good which is very encouraging .",
