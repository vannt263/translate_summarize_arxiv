    "magnetic flux tubes existing in the photosphere and lower chromosphere of the sun are considered to be narrow bundles of strong magnetic field lines that rapidly expand with height in the solar atmosphere ( e.g. , solanki 1993 ) .",
    "the fundamental modes of linear oscillations of these flux tubes are typically identified with longitudinal , transverse and torsional tube waves ( e.g. , defouw 1976 ; roberts & webb 1978 ; roberts 1979 , 1981 ; spruit 1981 , 1982 ; priest 1982 ; hollweg 1985 ; roberts 1991 ; roberts & ulmschneider 1997 ) , with the two latter waves being alfvn - like waves .",
    "observational evidence for the existence of alfvn - like waves in different regions of the solar atmosphere was given by high - resolution observations performed by the solar optical telescope ( sot ) and the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) onboard the hinode solar observatory . according to de pontieu et al .",

    "( 2011 ) , who reported indirect evidence for such waves found in observations by solar dynamic observatory ( sdo ) .    moreover , fujimura & tsuneta ( 2009 ) used sot observations to study fluctuations in pores and intergranular magnetic structures , and concluded that such fluctuations could be explained by the existence of longitudinal ( sausage ) and transverse ( kink ) waves propagating along magnetic flux tubes embedded in the solar photosphere .",
    "they found oscillation periods of 3 - 6 min for the pores and 4 - 9 min for the intergranular magnetic elements .",
    "more recently , okamoto and de pontieu ( 2011 ) used data from sot and presented observational evidence for the existence of high - frequency transverse waves propagating along spiclues in the solar atmosphere .",

    "( 2012 ) .    among the above described observational results , the observations perfomed by fujimura & tsuneta ( 2009 ) , okamoto and de pontieu ( 2011 ) , and yurchyshyn et al .",
    "( 2012 ) are the most relevant because the authors directly refer to transverse tube waves , which are the main topic of this paper .",
    "our goal here is to determine the propagation conditions for these waves by calculating the so - called cutoff frequencies . in general",
    ", there are global cutoff frequencies , which are the same along the entire length of the tube , and local cutoff frequencies that are height dependent .",
    "if , under certain simplifying approximations , the cutoff frequency is constant along the entire length of the tube , it is called a global cutoff .",
    "otherwise , if it is height dependent , it is a local cutoff . in section 6 , we compare these cutoff frequencies to the observational results .",
    "the global cutoff frequency represents the natural frequency of linear oscillations of the magnetic flux tubes , and its value restricts the wave propagation to only those frequencies that are higher than this cutoff . for isothermal and thin flux tubes , the global cutoff frequencies for longitudinal and transverse tube waves were first determined by defouw ( 1976 ) and spruit ( 1981 ) , respectively .",
    "these global cutoff frequencies are ratios of the characteristic wave speeds to the pressure ( density ) scale height . since the scale height and the wave speeds are constant along isothermal and exponentially expanding magnetic flux tubes , the resulting cutoffs are the same along the entire length of the tubes . the fact that there is no global cutoff frequency for torsional waves propagating along isothermal and thin magnetic flux tubes",
    "was demonstrated by musielak , routh & hammer ( 2007 ) .    a method to derive the global cutoff frequency for longitudinal tube waves",
    "was introduced by rae & roberts ( 1982 ) and musielak et al .",
    "( 1987 , 1995 ) , who demonstrated that the wave equation for these waves can be transformed into its standard form ( also referred to as the klein - gordon equation ) , which directly displays the global cutoff frequency .",
    "a similar method was used by musielak & ulmschneider ( 2001 , 2003 ) to determine the global cutoff frequency for transverse tube waves .",
    "these global cutoff frequencies are important in studies of atmospheric oscillations ( e.g. , roberts 1991 ; hasan & kalkofen 1999 ; hasan 2003 ; musielak & ulmschneider 2003 ; hasan 2008 ) and chromospheric and coronal heating ( e.g. , narain & ulmschneider 1996 ; ulmschneider & musielak 2003 ) .",
    "the existence of global cutoff frequencies is restricted to thin and isothermal magnetic flux tubes .",
    "however , in more general cases when the flux tubes are either wide and isothermal , or thin and non - isothermal , or wide and non - isothermal , the resulting cutoff frequencies depend on atmospheric height , which means that they are local quantities ( e.g. , routh , musielak & hammer 2007 ) .",
    "a method to determine such local cutoff frequencies was developed by musielak , musielak & mobashi ( 2006 ) .",
    "this method requires that wave equations are cast in their standard forms ( i.e.,without terms with the first - order derivatives ) and that the oscillation theorem ( e.g. , kahn 1990 ) is used to obtain the cutoff frequencies .",
    "the form of the oscillation theorem used in this paper is that given by kahn ( 1990 ) .",
    "different forms of this theorem were considered by mathematicians depending on specific differential equations and the applied boundary conditions .",
    "the basic idea was originally introduced by sturm ( 1836 ) , who considered a second - order ordinary differential equation written in its standard form and established a comparison criterion , which allowed him to determine whether solutions to the equation were oscillatory or not , without formally solving the equation .",
    "another comparison criterion was developed by kneser ( 1893 ) and later generalized by fite ( 1918 ) , hille ( 1948 ) , wintner ( 1949 , 1957 ) , and many others .",
    "the most important generalization of kneser s criterion was done by leighton ( 1950 , 1962 ) . in more recent work ,",
    "some oscillation theorems were established for linear ( e.g. , li & yeh 1995 , 1996 ) and nonlinear ( e.g. , li 1998 ; lee et al .",
    "2005 ; tyagi 2009 ) second - order differential equations .",
    "the oscillation theorem presented by kahn ( 1990 ) , which is used in this paper , is equivalent to kneser s criterion , which is also known as kneser s theorem ( e.g. , bohner & nal 2005 )",
    ". first applications of this theorem to solar physics problems were done by musielak & moore ( 1995 ) , who considered the propagation of linear alfvn waves in an isothermal solar atmosphere .",
    "then , schmitz & fleck ( 1998 ) used the theorem to establish criteria for acoustic wave propagation in the solar atmosphere .",
    "more recently the theorem was used by schmitz & fleck ( 2003 ) , musielak et al .",

    ", we use this method to derive the cutoff frequency for transverse waves propagating along a thin and non - isothermal magnetic flux tube embedded in the solar atmosphere .",
    "the effects of temperature gradients on the cutoff frequency are studied for several power - law temperature models as well as for the reference mean solar atmosphere model c given by vernazza , avrett & loeser ( 1981 ) .",
    "the height dependence of the cutoff frequency in these models is calculated , and it is shown that the value of this cutoff at a given atmospheric height determines the frequency that transverse tube waves must exceed in order to be propagating at this height .",
    "the results are compared to those previously obtained for a thin and isothermal magnetic flux tube .",
    "we also briefly discuss implications of our results for the energy and momentum balance of the solar atmosphere .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : the governing equations and derivation of our wave equations are given in section 2 ; the global cutoff frequency for linear transverse waves propagating along a thin and isothermal magnetic flux tube is obtained in section 3 ; the local cutoff frequency for the wave propagation along a thin and non - isothermal magnetic flux tube is derived in section 4 ; the local cutoff frequencies for different power - law temperature distributions and for the val c solar atmosphere model are presented and discussed in sections 5 and 6 , respectively ; and conclusions are given in section 7 .",
    "we consider a thin and non - isothermal magnetic flux tube that is embedded in the solar atmosphere . the tube axis is assumed to have a circular cross - section and an unperturbed tube axis oriented vertically along the @xmath0-axis , so that gravity @xmath1 .",
    "the tube density , pressure , temperature , and magnetic field are respectively given by @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , the density , pressure and temperature of the external non - magnetic ( @xmath6 ) atmosphere are represented by @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the tube is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings , which means that at each atmospheric height @xmath10 .    in the thin flux tube approximation ( e.g. , ferriz - mas et al .",

    "since the wave equations for @xmath27 and @xmath16 are different , there is a phase difference between the wave variables .",
    "physical consequences of the existence of this phase shift will be explored in the next sections .",
    "we now consider the special case of a thin and isothermal magnetic flux tube by taking @xmath28 = const , @xmath29 = const and @xmath30 , which gives @xmath14 = const and @xmath31 = const .",
    "this allows us to write the wave equations ( see equations ( [ s2eq7 ] ) and ( [ s2eq8 ] ) ) as @xmath32 and @xmath33 comparison of the above wave equations shows that they are different , which means that the behavior of the wave variables @xmath27 and @xmath16 is different even for a thin and isothermal flux tube .    the wave equation for @xmath27 was originally obtained by spruit ( 1981 , 1982 ) and he showed that the propagation of transverse waves along a thin and isothermal magnetic flux tube is affected by a cutoff frequency . a new result presented in this paper",
    "is that we also derive the wave equation for @xmath16 , show that it is different than the one obtained for @xmath27 , and demonstrate how to obtain the cutoff frequency for both wave variables .    to obtain the cutoff frequency ,",

    "( 2006 , 2007 ) and petukhov ( 2006 ) , gradients of restoring forces , which can introduce characteristic scale heights , are responsible for the origin of cutoff frequencies for different waves . using this argument ,",

    "2006 ) argued about the origin of the acoustic cutoff frequency and musielak et al .",
    "( 2007 ) showed that the propagation of torsional tube waves is cutoff - free .",
    "moreover , petukhov ( 2006 ) demonstrated that horizontal , non - uniform but potential magnetic fields have no influence on a cutoff frequency for magneto - acoustic waves and , as a result , the cutoff is identical to lamb s cutoff frequency , @xmath47 , which was obtained by lamb ( 1908 , 1975 ) for acoustic waves propagating in a stratified and isothermal medium .",
    "the results obtained here for transverse tube waves clearly show that the vertical and non - uniform ( exponentially diverging ) magnetic field of a thin and isothermal flux tube is responsible for the origin of spruit s cutoff frequency .",
    "actually , the existence of this cutoff is caused by the horizontal pressure balance , which relates the tube magnetic pressure to the gas pressure . since the latter introduces the pressure scale height @xmath31 that also determines the rate with which the field diverges with the atmospheric height , the tube magnetic field and its characteristic scale height are the main physical reasons for the existence of spruit s cutoff frequency .",
    "finally , we may relate the spruit cutoff @xmath38 to the lamb cutoff @xmath48 by writing @xmath49 which shows that the ratio of @xmath14 to @xmath22 determines how much @xmath38 differs from @xmath48 . for the special case @xmath50",

    "the effects of different temperature gradients on the cutoff frequency for transverse tube waves are presented in figure 2 .",
    "since the cutoff frequency is a local quantity , its value at a given atmospheric height determines the frequency that the waves must exceed in order to be propagating waves at this height .",
    "our results demonstrate that the conditions for wave propagation strongly depend on the temperature profiles .",
    "if the temperature increases linearly with height ( @xmath112 ) , the cutoff frequency starts with its maximum at @xmath145 and then decreases with height .",
    "for the temperature model with @xmath140 , the cutoff frequency remains practically constant with height .",
    "however , the cutoff frequency always increases with height in the temperature models with @xmath158 ; the higher the value of @xmath104 , the steeper an increase of the local cutoff frequency with height is observed .",
    "the main purpose of using the power - law temperature models was to demonstrate the dependence of the local cutoff frequency on the increasing steepness of the temperature models .",
    "obviously , the power - law models do not properly describe the temperature gradients in the solar atmosphere .",
    "therefore , we now consider a more realistic model of the solar atmosphere .",
    "we assume that a thin flux tube is embedded in the reference mean solar atmosphere model val - c ( vernazza et al .  1981 ) . in this model",
    ", the height @xmath159 km corresponds to unity optical depth , where the temperature is @xmath160 k. beyond the temperature minimum @xmath161 k , which is located at @xmath162 km , the model extends through the chromosphere well into the transition region to the corona , up to a temperature of @xmath163 k. at the base of the transition region the val - c model exhibits a plateau with a temperature around @xmath164 k , caused by ly@xmath165 emission .",
    "this plateau was later shown to disappear if the physics of the transition region is treated more realistically ( fontenla et al .",
    "therefore we restrict ourselves to the height range from @xmath166 km ( optical depth unity ) to the just below the plateau ( @xmath167 km ) .    to calculate the characteristic wave speed @xmath14 as a function of @xmath0 , we have to know the magnetic field @xmath168 , which is not given in the val - c model .",
    "since the tube is assumed to be in in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings at each atmospheric height , we use the local value of the pressure scale height , which is the same outside and inside the tube , to evaluate @xmath169 ; the calculation begins with an assumed surface magnetic field @xmath170 g ( see equation  ( [ s2eq1 ] ) ) . having obtained the distribution of the tube magnetic field with height , we then calculate the gas pressure and density inside the tube , and the characteristic wave speed @xmath171 ( see equation  ( [ s2eq3 ] ) ) . in the lower panel of figure  3",
    "we plot @xmath14 versus the atmospheric height in the model ; for comparison we also plot the sound speed @xmath22 .",
    "the results show that @xmath14 is smaller than @xmath22 in almost the entire model , except in the upper chromosphere and lower transition region , where @xmath14 becomes comparable to , or even slightly larger than , @xmath22 .    in order to calculate the wave propagation time @xmath58",
    ", we use equation  ( [ s5eq16 ] ) . for the integration",
    "constant @xmath172 we choose a value of 100 s , thus assuming that the waves have traveled for 100 s before they reach the base @xmath102 of the model .",
    "for typical wave speeds ( cf .  lower panel of figure  3 ) this means that the waves are generated about two scale heights below @xmath102 .    to determine the cutoff frequency @xmath173 according to section 4.5 , we calculate both turning - point frequencies @xmath174 and @xmath175 and select the larger one as @xmath176 ( see equations ( [ s5eq20 ] ) , ( [ s5eq21 ] ) , and ( [ s5eq24])([s5eq26 ] ) )",
    "to perform these calculations , we must evaluate the first derivative of @xmath14 and @xmath31 , and the second derivative of @xmath14 .",
    "these calculations have to be done numerically because the model consists of tabulated data .",
    "the upper panel of figure  3 shows the resulting cutoff frequency @xmath176 as well as spruit s cutoff frequency @xmath177 ( cf .",
    "equation ( [ s3eq4 ] ) ) , where the latter is again treated here as a local , height - dependent quantity .",
    "a striking property of figure  3 is that the cutoff frequency for the nonisothermal case , @xmath176 , is wiggly .",
    "this is mostly caused by the dependence of the turning - point frequencies on the second derivative of the tube speed @xmath14 ( cf .",
    "equations ( [ s5eq20 ] ) ([s5eq21 ] ) ) . since the val - c model is specified by a number of tabulated distinct points , the curves in figure  3 must be plotted by finding interpolating or fitting functions through these points and determining the first derivative of the scale height , and the first and second derivatives of the tube speed , in order to calculate the terms in equations ( [ s5eq20])([s5eq21 ] ) .",
    "such derivatives of interpolated curves tend to show a wiggly behavior .",
    "as shown in the middle and lower panels of figure  3 , these wiggles are stronger near the temperature minimum and in particular at the foot of the transition region , where the gradients change rapidly ( see also fawzy & musielak 2012 ) .",
    "one could avoid the wiggles by approximating the data by simple functions with known smooth derivatives .",
    "there are also automatic algorithms that can smooth out such wiggles more or less completely ( e.g. , chartrand 2011 ) .",
    "however , we show them here explicitly in order to illustrate the dependence of the cutoff frequency , via these derivatives , on the nature of the solar atmosphere , which in reality is less homogeneous than the val - c model and in addition temporally variable . therefore , we chose the well - proven algorithm by reinsch ( 1967 ) , which fits the data points by a natural cubic spline , thus giving consistent first and second derivatives .",
    "a moderate amount of smoothing can be applied , so that the spline needs not go exactly through the points .",
    "since the value of @xmath94 is different at each atmospheric height , the frequency @xmath40 of a transverse tube wave must be higher than the cutoff at a given height @xmath0 in order to be propagating at this height .",
    "overall , the new cutoff frequency @xmath94 is seen to be slightly higher than @xmath38 throughout the chromosphere .",
    "this is mostly caused by the fact that the chromospheric temperature increases with height , leading to a positive first derivative of the tube speed @xmath14 , which increases both turning - point frequencies ( cf .",
    "equations ( [ s5eq20 ] ) and ( [ s5eq21 ] ) ) and thus also their maximum , the cutoff frequency @xmath94 ( equation ( [ s5eq26 ] ) ) .",
    "another difference between the spruit cutoff and our new result lies in the behavior at the foot of the transition region . here",
    "@xmath38 decreases with height ( which becomes more evident if one continues the calculation to higher levels of the val - c model ) , while @xmath94 increases rapidly as we approach the steep temperature rise in the transition region .",
    "formally this means that a wave with arbitrary frequency tends to lie above @xmath38 at the transition region ( implying propagation in the case of an isothermal treatment of the cutoff ) , but below our value ( implying reflection off the temperature gradient in our nonisothermal treatment ) .",
    "this may have implications for the contribution of such transverse waves to the heating and dynamics of the overlying corona .",
    "however , we put not much weight on such differences in the high chromosphere and transition region , fow two reasons .",
    "first , we have not provided a complete study of the reflection properties of the transition region , which would require a more complex analysis of the complete solar atmosphere . and",
    "second , a basic approximation underlying all these theories breaks down much earlier , already in the mid chromosphere - namely , that the flux tubes can be approximated as thin .",
    "the thin flux tube approximation , which is the basis for the results presented in this paper and for spruit s results as well , is no longer valid at those heights .",
    "thus the results obtained for the upper atmosphere must be taken with caution .",
    "we have extended the calculations up to the foot of the transition region in order to determine the approximate behavior of the cutoffs in these layers , even though this is beyond the formal limit of validity of our analytical results , because the presented results demonstrate that the temperature gradient in the upper solar chromosphere and in the solar transition region will have a major influence on the propagation of transverse tube waves .",
    "the increase of temperature with height requires atmospheric heating , which is typically identified with acoustic - gravity and flux tube waves , including transverse tube waves , or with phenomena related to magnetic reconnection ( e.g. , priest 1982 ; narain & ulmschneider 1996 ; ulmschneider & musielak 2003 ) .",
    "our results presented in figure  3 give constraints on the range of frequencies of transverse tube waves that are propagating in different parts of the solar atmosphere .",
    "our results show that in the upper photosphere and lower chromosphere @xmath178 , or the cutoff period is 500 s , and that in the middle and upper chromosphere @xmath179 , which corresponds to the cutoff period of 350 s. as already mentioned in section 1 , fujimura & tsuneta ( 2009 ) observed transverse tube waves with periods of 240 - 540 s , or the corresponding frequency range @xmath180 , in intergranular magnetic elements .",
    "comparison of these observational results to our theoretical cutoff frequencies shows that most of the observed waves are freely propagating in the solar photosphere and lower chromosphere because @xmath181 , however , in the middle and upper parts of the solar chromosphere the waves with frequencies @xmath182 are not propagating .",
    "now , the high frequency waves with periods of 45 s , or @xmath183 , observed by okamoto & de pontieu ( 2011 ) along spicules do satisfy the condition @xmath184 and they are obviously freely propagating waves in the solar chromosphere .",
    "similarly , the high frequency oscillations with periods ranging from 30 s to 180 s , which corresponds to the frequency range @xmath185 , detected by yurchyshyn et al .",
    "( 2012 ) in type ii spicules also satisfy the condition @xmath184 , and therefore they are freely propagating waves in the solar chromosphere .",
    "the above constraints can be used to assess the role of transverse tube waves in the heating and dynamics of the solar atmosphere . as discussed by hasan & kalkofen ( 1999 ) , musielak & ulmschneider ( 2003 ) , and hasan ( 2003 )",
    ", transverse tube waves may be responsible for the excitation of solar atmospheric oscillations observed in magnetically active regions near sunspots .",
    "the results obtained in this paper can be used to determine the natural frequency of the solar atmosphere inside thin and non - isothermal magnetic flux tubes and the effects of temperature gradients on solar atmospheric oscillations .",
    "our method to determine the cutoff frequency for transverse waves propagating along a thin and non - isothermal flux tube requires that integral transformations are used to cast the wave equations for both wave variables in the standard forms .",
    "then the conditions for the existence of propagating wave solutions are established by using the oscillation theorem .",
    "the theorem is also used to obtain the turning - point frequency for each wave variable .",
    "the larger among the two turning - point frequencies is selected as the cutoff frequency .",
    "to study the effects of temperature gradients on the cutoff frequency , we used different power - law temperature distributions .",
    "for the temperature that increases linearly with height , the cutoff frequency is large at the bottom of the model and then decreases with height .",
    "for the temperature profile with the power of @xmath186 , the cutoff frequency remains practically constant with height .",
    "however , for powers higher than @xmath186 , the cutoff frequency always increases with height ; and the higher the power , the steeper the increase of the cutoff frequency with height",
    ".    we also calculated the cutoff frequency @xmath94 as a function of height @xmath0 in the val - c model and compared it to spruit s global cutoff frequency @xmath187 that was treated as a height - dependent quantity .",
    "the comparison shows that @xmath94 exceeds @xmath187 , and that the differences are especially prominent in the upper parts of the model , where however the thin flux tube approximation is not valid any longer .",
    "the differences in the lower atmosphere , where the thin flux tube approximation is valid , may be important for the energy carried by transverse tube waves from the solar convection zone , where the waves are generated , to the overlying solar atmosphere , where the wave energy is deposited .",
    "the cutoff frequency @xmath94 calculated for the val - c model gives constraints on the range of frequencies of transverse tube waves that are propagating in different parts of the solar atmosphere .",
    "we compared @xmath94 to the range of frequencies determined from observations by fujimura & tsuneta ( 2009 ) , okamoto & de pontieu ( 2011 ) , and yurchyshyn et al .",
    "based on this comparison , we established that most of the waves observed by fujimura & tsuneta ( 2009 ) in intergranular magnetic elements are freely propagating in the solar photosphere and lower chromosphere , however , in the middle and upper solar chromosphere the lower frequency part of these waves corresponds to non - propagating waves . on the other hand , all the waves detected by okamoto & de pontieu ( 2011 ) and yurchyshyn et al .",
    "( 2012 ) in spicules are freely propagating waves in the solar chromosphere .",
    "these constraints are important for understanding the role played by transverse tube waves in the heating of the solar atmosphere and in the acceleration of plasma , e.g.  in spicules and the solar wind .",
    "our results can be used to determine the natural frequency of the solar atmosphere inside thin and non - isothermal flux tubes and to study the effects of the temperature stratification on the excitation of atmospheric oscillations inside solar magnetic flux tubes .",
