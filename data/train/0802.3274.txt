    "a central model behind the theoretical description of competition among dissimilar species was introduced by @xcite . in the model ,",
    "species are characterized by their niche position @xmath0 , which measures a trait being relevant for the exploitation of a distributed resource . as examples ,",
    "the niche value @xmath0 may represent body size of predators , where the distributed resource are preys with their size distribution , or @xmath0 could be beak sizes of birds , in which case the resource could be seeds of different sizes .",
    "mathematically this leads to a lotka - volterra type of competition equation , where the competition coefficients are function of the distance between species on the niche axis @xmath1 .",
    "this competition kernel is usually taken to be a gaussian function of the niche difference ( also called normal curve ) .",
    "the implication of this choice is the central topic of this paper .",
    "the model was originally proposed as part of the hypothesis of limiting similarity , namely that competing species can coexist only if they are sufficiently different from each other @xcite . a mathematical analysis of the model revealed that arbitrarily similar species could in fact coexist in some cases .",
    "however adding further effects to the model , like noise ( @xcite , but see @xcite ) or extinction thresholds @xcite , impose a limit to the similarity between species .",
    "this sensitivity to second order effects has led to the conclusion that the model , in its original form , is structurally unstable when used to predict limits of similarity @xcite .",
    "the competition model has also been applied to describe coevolving species @xcite and used in some formulations of the theory of island biogeography @xcite .",
    "more recently the same type of model has been simulated numerically and used as a basis for dynamical models of sympatric speciation @xcite , food web assembly and evolution @xcite , elucidating the relation between competition and predator - prey interactions @xcite , and for explaining lumped size distributions of species @xcite . for a more extensive review of the biological applications and",
    "the generalization of the model see @xcite .",
    "the competition model has been fundamental for the development of basic principles in theoretical ecology and it is relevant to achieve a full understanding of its technical aspects .    in almost all applications of the model",
    "the chosen competition kernel is gaussian .",
    "this choice facilitates mathematical analysis , and was justified because the exact shape of the kernel was thought to have no influence on the fundamental results of the model .",
    "however , recent work has shown that the equilibrium solution can be one of two fundamentally different types , depending on the form of the competition kernel @xcite .",
    "one class of competition kernels preserves all species initially introduced in the system , with adjustments only in their relative abundance .",
    "the final equilibrium is a state with species closely spaced and with roughly similar abundances ( if the carrying capacity is also uniform ) .",
    "another class of competition kernels leads to the species being lumped in dense groups ( in some cases groups are formed by single species ) , separated by empty regions on the niche axis .",
    "subsequent invasion of new species in these ` exclusion zones ' is not possible due to competitive exclusion .",
    "the condition for uniform distribution of species is to have a _ positive definite _ competition kernel ( see definition below ) .",
    "this criterion is automatically fulfilled when the kernel is constructed from the overlap of the species utilization of the resource @xcite .",
    "if the kernel is not positive definite , a lumpy species distribution with exclusion zones emerges .",
    "the concern about this discovery is that , even though the gaussian kernel is ecologically sound , it is exactly marginal between the two regimes .",
    "this indicates that numerical inaccuracies and/or secondary ecological effects may violate the positive definiteness of the competition kernel and cause a transition from a uniform to a lumpy species distribution .",
    "the objective of this paper is to raise awareness in the theoretical ecology community of the potential pitfalls and subtleties associated with the use of gaussian competition kernels or other marginal choices . to illustrate this ,",
    "the consequences of the marginal nature of the gaussian kernel in the competition model are explored , in the idealized case of a uniform carrying capacity .",
    "first , the sensitivity to ecologically relevant effects that may lead to lumpy distributions are examined .",
    "then we examine the sensitivity to the details of numerical implementation . in the last section ,",
    "we discuss the relevance of our results for the applications of the model .",
    "the competition model considers @xmath2 interacting populations , each utilizing a common distributed resource @xmath1 according to a utilization function @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "the dynamics of the abundance of species @xmath5 , @xmath6 , is described by a lotka - volterra set of competition equations : @xmath7 where the growth rate ( considered to be the same for all species ) is set to one for simplicity , and the carrying capacity @xmath8 is uniform .",
    "competition in ( [ eq : lv ] ) is described by competition coefficients @xmath9 which are constructed from the overlap of utilization functions of competing species @xcite : @xmath10 a justification of ( [ eq : interaction ] ) rests upon considering the probability that consumer @xmath5 meets consumer @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "often , utilization functions are ignored , and the competition coefficients are postulated directly .",
    "it is usually assumed that species @xmath5 has an optimal exploitation of the resource at a value @xmath12 , and the competition coefficients are taken to depend on the difference between the optimal resource values of two competing species , @xmath13 , such that we can introduce the so - called competition kernel , @xmath14 .",
    "here we use a family of competition functions described by a parameter @xmath15 : @xmath16 which contains the gaussian kernel when @xmath17 , or the exponential one when @xmath18 .",
    "the width of the kernel @xmath19 gives the range of competition on the niche axis .",
    "incidentally the gaussian kernel is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : interaction ] ) when the utilization functions are also gaussian and of the form @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "when @xmath22 the kernels are more peaked around @xmath23 and for @xmath24 they become more box - like ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : patterns ] ) .",
    "note that when competition coefficients are constructed by the formula ( [ eq : interaction ] ) , i.e.  from the overlap of two utilization functions , they are always _ positive definite _ , meaning that @xmath25 for any set of numbers @xmath26 @xcite or , equivalently , that the fourier transform of @xmath27 , defined as @xmath28 , does not take negative values .",
    "this property holds for the family of kernels ( [ eq : alpha ] ) for @xmath29 , but not for @xmath24 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : patterns ] ) .",
    "the gaussian kernel is therefore marginal in the sense that , corresponding to the limit case @xmath17 , even a very small perturbation may violate its positive definite character , generally believed to be an ecological requirement arising from expression ( [ eq : interaction ] ) .",
    "an intuitive explanation for the appearance of the exclusion zones for @xmath24 is the following .",
    "interaction kernels with large @xmath15 have a box - like shape . in these cases species",
    "compete very strongly with other species , roughly within a distance @xmath30 from their own niche value .",
    "species with a niche @xmath1 in that range will therefore not be able to invade the resident species , leading to the exclusion zones between them . when @xmath15 is decreased , the resident species compete less and less with neighbouring species , until the exclusion zones disappear , leading to the possibility of continuous coexistence .    understanding the fact that the transition occurs at @xmath17 , and also the coexistence of more than one species in each cluster , requires a mathematical stability analysis of the model .",
    "consider the uniform solution , in which many species having the same abundance are densely packed in niche space . now",
    "perturb each population by a small quantity @xmath31 , which can be either positive or negative .",
    "if the competition kernel is not positive defined , there are sets of perturbations such that @xmath32 is less than zero .",
    "one can show that such perturbations are amplified by the dynamics @xcite , making the uniform solution unstable .",
    "the system will then evolve to a clustered state , where the distance between clusters is proportional to the interaction range @xmath19 .",
    "we mention here that a possible generalization is to consider multi - dimensional niche spaces .",
    "this possibility would complicate the mathematical notation but does not introduce qualitative changes .",
    "stability in a multi - dimensional niche space still depends on the positive definiteness of the competition kernel .",
    "in particular , a multi - dimensional gaussian competition kernel is still marginal in the sense described above .",
    "we simulated the model ( [ eq : lv ] ) with competition kernel ( [ eq : alpha ] ) for 1000 generations and @xmath33 species initially at random niche positions .",
    "the width of the kernel is @xmath34 and the carrying capacity is @xmath35 .",
    "the niche range is taken to be @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "the standard mathematical way to avoid effects due to the borders of the niche space is to adopt periodic boundary conditions ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these are introduced for mathematical convenience and aim at modeling species far from endpoints in a large niche space .",
    "adopting periodic boundary conditions means that niche space is circular , so that when the interaction kernels extends beyond the left edge at @xmath37 , it enters back into the right side at @xmath38 and vice versa .",
    "periodic boundaries therefore mimic an infinite system by considering the niche segment @xmath39 $ ] as embedded in an array of repeated copies of itself .",
    "mathematically , this is properly implemented by making a kernel wrap , i.e.  substitute @xmath27 in ( [ eq : alpha ] ) with @xmath40 , where the sum runs from @xmath41 .",
    "we call this implementation `` fully periodic boundary conditions '' , to distinguish it from another possibility considered below . under fully periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "the stability properties of the uniform solution are the same as in the infinite system .",
    "simulations using the competition kernel ( [ eq : alpha ] ) with @xmath42 ( exponential ) , @xmath43 ( gaussian ) and @xmath44 ( box - like ) illustrate the uniform species distributions for @xmath18 and @xmath17 , and the lumped species clusters for @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : patterns ] ) . the configurations in fig .",
    "[ fig : patterns ] are still transient states and , at longer times , configurations with @xmath46 become more uniform , whereas the periodically spaced clusters of species for @xmath24 become thinner until they contain only a single species . in any case , from the initial stages until the final equilibrium , the main difference between the dynamics for the two classes of competition kernel is unchanged : for @xmath46 all initial species are preserved , leading to dense and evenly distributed configurations , whereas ` exclusion zones ' develop for @xmath24 leading to lumped species distributions .",
    "a natural question is whether the marginal nature of gaussian competition can be brought on by secondary ecological effects .",
    "we have checked that adding a small immigration rate does not produce lumpy distributions . adding noise or an extinction threshold ( i.e.",
    "species are removed when their populations fall below a threshold ) result in a limit to similarity between species , but does not lead to clustering @xcite .",
    "this also happens in non marginal cases with @xmath47 , where the minimum distance between species is unrelated to the competition range @xmath19 .",
    "effect of species extinction , invasion , and speciation was simulated by eliminating species below a given population threshold , and introducing invading species at a fixed rate . if they are introduced at random locations in niche space",
    "no patterns are observed .",
    "if invading species are introduced close to existing ones , modeling evolutionary change and speciation @xcite , the system ends with a lumped species distribution , even for @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : immigration ] ) .",
    "however , the same mechanism has no effect if an exponential competition kernel ( @xmath18 ) is chosen .",
    "the interpretation is that evolutionary effects favor the formation of lumpy species distributions , but only when the competition kernel is close to the gaussian limiting case .",
    "generations with speciation and extinction .",
    "species whose population goes below @xmath48 are removed from the system .",
    "every @xmath49 generations new species are introduced close to an existing one .",
    "the parent species is chosen with a probability proportional to its population ; the distance of the new species to its parent is drawn from a gaussian distribution of zero mean and spread @xmath50 .",
    "the new species @xmath11 is introduced with a population uniformly drawn from the interval @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "( left panel ) gaussian kernel ( @xmath17 ) and ( right panel ) exponential kernel ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "simulations are performed with fully periodic boundary conditions . @xmath35 and @xmath52.,width=302 ]",
    "the most obvious numerical simplification is to only partially implement the periodic boundary conditions , by omitting the kernel wrap around the niche interval , that is , using @xmath27 , with @xmath53 being the minimum of the two possible distances among species @xmath5 and @xmath11 ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) , instead of the periodic kernel @xmath56 .",
    "the resulting effective kernel is gaussian but truncated at @xmath57 , making it no longer positive definite .",
    "although the shapes of @xmath27 and @xmath56 are still very similar for the parameters used here ( @xmath52 ) , the change immediately leads to lumped species distributions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : numerical ] ) .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath18 ( or any other values of @xmath47 which we have checked ) , changing @xmath56 by @xmath27 has no noticeable effect .",
    "qualitatively , the dynamics for truncated gaussian kernels resembles the outcome when the exponent of the competition kernel is perturbed just slightly .",
    "e.g.  using @xmath58 instead of @xmath17 also leads to lumped species distributions , even when fully periodic boundary conditions are implemented ( not shown ) .",
    "while the mathematical analysis of `` evolutionary diffusion '' is rather complicated and results can be obtained only in the framework of simple models @xcite , the effect of truncation on the different kernels may be analyzed in more depth and is discussed in the next subsection .",
    "species after @xmath59 generations with ( left panel ) gaussian competition kernel with fully periodic boundary conditions , and ( right panel ) with truncated gaussian competition kernel ( see text ) .",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath52 . ,",
    "width=302 ]      we have numerically shown in the previous section that truncation leads to radically different results for the gaussian and exponential kernel .",
    "this may be surprising when realizing that neither the truncated gaussian nor the truncated exponential kernel are positive defined .",
    "the explanation of the different result comes from the wavelength of the modes @xmath60 for which the fourier transform of the kernel @xmath61 takes negative values , as it determines the distance between lumps @xcite .    to find these wavelengths , we start from the gaussian case and show what is the effect of truncating the kernel at a distance @xmath62 ( which we take now to be the niche - space size , previously scaled to be 1 ) : @xmath63,\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the error function , and @xmath65 stands for complex conjugate .",
    "we impose @xmath66 , so we can get a simpler expression by expanding the error function , yielding @xmath67\\ ] ] from the previous expression we see that the wavenumbers that give negative modes are order @xmath68 .",
    "we now check the same effect in the exponential case : @xmath69 in this case the instability occurs for large wavenumbers , proportional to @xmath70 .",
    "we checked numerically that kernels with @xmath47 behave like the @xmath18 case , with the wavenumber of the first negative mode growing exponentially with the size of the niche space .    summarizing",
    ", the kernels we considered develop an instability due to the truncation , but at very different frequencies : very high for the exponential kernel ( exponential in the ratio between the system size and the kernel range ) compared with the gaussian ( proportional to the same ratio ) .",
    "the consequence is that , already when the size of the niche space is large but not extremely large compared with the competition distance ( like the cases considered here , @xmath71 ) , the unstable mode in the exponential case has a wavelength being much smaller than the interspecies distance , and is thus unable to generate patterns .",
    "the model ( [ eq : lv])-([eq : alpha ] ) provides a very abstract representation of competition . both empirical observations and theoretical approaches , based on explicit consideration of the coupled consumer - resource dynamics ,",
    "lead to competition coefficients which are quite different from gaussian @xcite , except in a few particular cases .",
    "even so , the qualitative outcome of the model does not depend on the exact shape of the competition kernel , but only on its positive or non - positive definite character .",
    "we have restricted our considerations primarily to the basic model ( [ eq : lv ] ) with gaussian interaction kernel and constant carrying capacity since it is the simplest implementation , allowing to illustrate in a clear setting the importance of @xmath72 and the issues caused by the choice of a marginal competition kernel .    the basic model with competition coefficients obtained from the overlap of utilization functions , which yields always positive definite kernels , allows for dense species distributions with no limits to similarity .",
    "this fundamental solution may be changed by three different effects : 1 ) effects stemming from the competition kernel being no longer positive definite lead to lumpy species distributions .",
    "clusters of species will appear , separated by exclusion zones in niche space with a spacing proportional to the width of the competition kernel @xmath19 ; 2 ) second order ecological effects like noise , species heterogeneity , evolutionary effects , or the introduction of an extinction threshold lead to a limit to the similarity with the spacing between species being independent of @xmath19 ; 3 ) under a non constant carrying capacity , patterns of unevenly spaced species , lumpy or not , may appear .",
    "this lead @xcite to conclude that `` the not - very - smooth nature of the carrying capacity seems to be essential for limiting similarity '' .",
    "notice that also some types of smooth , but non - uniform , carrying capacities may originate lumped distributions @xcite    the first case arises when the competition kernel is not positive definite .",
    "the main point of this paper is that , when the competition kernel is the marginal gaussian , the model becomes very sensitive to additional effects that may lead to lumpy species distribution . as an example",
    ", we demonstrated that a simple representation of evolutionary diffusion @xcite may lead to patterns in the gaussian case .",
    "this effect is similar to that of evolutionary dynamics under assortative mating which shown to lead to lumpy species distributions @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , in the context of evolutionary dynamics , the fact that the presence of clusters depends of the choice of the competition kernel has been recently demonstrated @xcite .",
    "patterns can also result from numerical approximations , such as truncating the tails of a gaussian competition kernel .",
    "this effect is probably the underlying mechanism behind species clustering observed in recent numerical work @xcite , which was used to explain observed lumpy distributions @xcite .",
    "additional ecological effects have been identified however @xcite which make the species groups a robust phenomenon ( see @xcite for analytical solutions of this type ) . in any case , these spurious effects can be avoided by paying attention to numerical details or by using a competition kernel which is not marginal , e.g.  one with @xmath73 , which in practice is almost indistinguishable from the gaussian one .",
    "it is worth mentioning that analytical ( i.e.  not numerical ) results are not affected by the marginal nature of the gaussian kernel , both in relation to limiting similarity @xcite , coevolution @xcite or criteria for sympatric speciation @xcite .",
    "the marginal nature of gaussian competition kernel may however affect numerical work on food web evolution and assembly @xcite .    since a non - positive definite competition kernel leads to lumpy species distributions",
    "a natural question is whether a non - positive definite kernel can result from hypothesis on ecological interactions .",
    "this case is often neglected in the literature , since assuming eq .",
    "( [ eq : interaction ] ) automatically leads to a positive definite competition kernel @xcite .",
    "however , as emphasized in @xcite and references therein , under quite general assumptions one should introduce two different utilization - like functions : a _ sensitivity _ function @xmath74 , describing the effect of the resource at @xmath1 on the growth of species @xmath5 , and an _ impact _ function @xmath75 , describing the depletion of resources produced by @xmath5 .",
    "then , the competition coefficients depend on the overlap of these two quantities @xmath76 , and reduce to ( [ eq : interaction ] ) only if the sensitivity and impact functions are proportional , with the constant of proportionality being the ecological efficiency .",
    "when the ecological efficiency is a function of @xmath1 , and the sensitivity and impact functions are no longer proportional , the competition kernel may cease to be positive definite @xcite .",
    "the third mechanism is that of a non - constant carrying capacity @xmath77 , which has been explored by @xcite .",
    "they found that some choices of carrying capacity leads to an irregular species lumping .",
    "the effect of non - constant carrying capacity in conjunction with both positive and non - positive definite competition kernels was explored by @xcite .",
    "the emerging picture is that the two mechanisms are independent .",
    "the cases in which a non - constant carrying capacity leads to uniform species distributions can also be destabilized by a non - positive definite kernel .",
    "this means that the mechanism explored here is not a particularity of constant carrying capacity but is present also in more general settings .",
    "it has been suggested that the effect of cutting the kernel is similar to that of having a finite niche space , i.e. of a box - like carrying capacity @xcite .",
    "however , this analogy does not hold to a rigorous mathematical analysis , which has demonstrated that lumps may appear when the carrying capacity is non - constant , but that this effect is not mathematically equivalent to a cut kernel @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent results @xcite show how the effect of closed boundaries depend on the details of the boundary shape , so that the box - like case is not representative of a general finite niche space .",
    "having outlined the reasons that may cause the three different outcomes , the question arises if it is possible to infer whether one effect or the other is at play from the result of a numerical integration of the competition model .",
    "it can be difficult to distinguish between a uniform distribution of discrete species and a lumpy one when lumps are very narrow and close . here , the fact that in the lumpy distribution the spacing of the lumps is proportional to the width of the competition kernel @xmath19 can be used .",
    "if changing @xmath19 results in a change in the distance between species proportional to @xmath19 , the effect is due to a non - positive definite competition kernel and vice versa . in the case where the effect is due to the carrying capacity being",
    "non - constant the spacing of species is usually more irregular @xcite .    to summarize : in line with previous works we have found that the case of continuous coexistence ( no limits to similarity ) may be limited by a variety of effects , specially for the gaussian kernel which has a marginal character .",
    "we have underlined that there are different ways to limit similarity , some leading to lumpy species distributions and others not .",
    "we hope that this article will increase the awareness in the theoretical ecological community of the potential subtleties associated with the use of the gaussian competition kernel .",
    "even though this functional form appears to be natural , in particular for analytical work , it may not be the most prudent choice for numerical exploration of the niche model .",
