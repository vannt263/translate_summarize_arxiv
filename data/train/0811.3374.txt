    "the large millimeter telescope ( lmt ) is a 50-meter diameter millimeter - wavelength single - dish telescope being built jointly by the university of massachusetts , amherst in the usa and the instituto nacional de astrofsica , ptica y electrnica in mexico ( @xcite ) .",
    "the telescope uses recent advances in structural design and active control of surface elements , and aims to reach an overall effective surface accuracy of @xmath0 @xmath1 m and an ultimate pointing accuracy of better than 1@xmath2 .",
    "the lmt is sited at 4600  m elevation at a latitude of 19@xmath3  n in the mexican state of puebla and offers good sky coverage of both hemispheres .",
    "the normally low humidity will allow operation at frequencies as high as 345 ghz .",
    "telescope construction is well advanced .",
    "three of the planned five rings of surface panels are in place .",
    "the initial complement of instruments will include sequoia , a 32 element heterodyne focal plane array for 3 mm that is currently in use at fcrao ; aztec , a large format , focal plane bolometer array that has had successful runs on the jcmt and aste ; a dual - polarization receiver for the 1 mm band ; and a unique wide band receiver and spectrometer , the redshift search receiver ( rsr ) , the instrument utilized in the present paper .",
    "the rsr ( @xcite ) utilizes very wideband indium phosphide mmic amplifiers operated at 20 k and has two dual polarization beams ( thus a total of 4 receivers ) .",
    "heterodyne receivers require a fast beam switch to produce flat spectral baselines over such a wide bandwidth , and the rsr uses a novel polarization switch operating at 1  khz ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is the first wide band , low loss electrical switch operating at a wavelength as short as 3  mm .",
    "the fast polarization switch is followed by a broadband orthomode transducer ( omt ) that splits the polarizations into two independent receivers .",
    "one beam of each polarization of the rsr is always on source .",
    "the principal motivation for the construction of the rsr is to measure the spectra , and particularly the redshift z , of very distant galaxies .",
    "galaxies are believed to form in the very early universe with the first episode of star formation @xmath4 years after the big bang , corresponding to ( z @xmath5 ) .",
    "understanding the formation process requires a catalog of a significant population out to z @xmath6 ( @xmath7 yrs ) .",
    "although these objects are relatively easy to detect in continuum , their distance and age are not easy to determine .    a few of these galaxies have redshifts measured in the visible , but most have no visible counterpart .",
    "the strongest emission lines from galaxies at roughly mm - wavelengths are the rotational transitions of co , and the rsr bandwidth is large enough that there is a very high probability that one line of co will fall in the observing band for redshifts z @xmath8 , and that two co rotational lines will be in the band for z @xmath9 . when two lines of the co rotational ladder are detected within the rsr band , the redshift is uniquely determined .",
    "since the lmt is not yet complete ( we are hoping for initial 3  mm commissioning during 2008 ) , the rsr was installed on the fcrao 14  m telescope during spring 2007 .",
    "the receiver frontend worked very well with the spectrometer to give very flat baselines .",
    "co emission from 22 ulirgs at moderate redshift was detected ( @xcite ) , and broadband 3  mm spectra of many nearby galaxies were obtained .",
    "the latter are presented here .",
    "each pixel of the rsr is sent to 6 different backend cards , each of which can process @xmath10 ghz of bandwidth .",
    "twenty - four backend cards are required to process all four pixels over the 75111 ghz bandwidth .",
    "while all four frontend pixels were available for the spring 2007 run , only 4 out of the required 24 sections of the rsr backend spectrometer had been fabricated at that time , and were ready to use .",
    "for the nearby galaxy work , these four spectrometer cards were hooked up to the best pixel of the frontend to cover first a bandwidth range of 85  111 ghz , and then in separate observations a frequency range of 75  92 ghz .",
    "the two sets of observations are combined and averaged together ( using special - purpose software written specifically for the rsr ) to produce the spectra presented here .",
    "in figures  [ m82 ] and [ ic342 ] , we show the full 3  mm band spectra towards two galaxies , m82 and ic342 .",
    "the emission lines from a number of molecular species are detected in the observed galaxies ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "note that the j=1 - 0 transition of @xmath11co , normally the strongest 3  mm emission line from galaxies , is not included in the observed bandwidth , but would move into the band for moderate values of the redshift z. as has been found by previous observers ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the ratios of the integrated intensities of such important chemical tracers as hcn , hnc , hco@xmath12 , n@xmath13h@xmath12 , cs and @xmath14co vary among the galaxies . it has been proposed that such variations may be due to differences in the relative importance of photon - dominated regions ( pdrs ) ; x - ray dominated regions ( xdrs ) , perhaps in the vicinity of agns ; shocked regions ; warm , dense molecular clouds ; and infrared pumping for hcn and hnc ( e.g. , @xcite ) . because of the rather large beam - size of the fcrao 14  m telescope ( from 45  65 arcsec ) , it is difficult to definitely separate these effects for our galaxies ; this will be much more clear cut with the lmt , whose corresponding beam size will be in the range 12  18 arcsec .",
    "nonetheless , we note that our results for the ratios of the integrated intensities hco@xmath12/hcn , hnc / hco@xmath12 , and hnc / hcn ( see table  [ tab1]a ) agree well for m82 , ngc 253 and arp 220 with those reported by @xcite ( observations with the iram 30 m and the sest 15 m ) , although those latter authors give somewhat higher values for the hnc / hcn ratio in ngc 253 .",
    ".(a ) molecular line ratios in 4 galaxies ( j=1 - 0 except cs , j=2 - 1 ) .",
    "( b ) other detected lines . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "spectra in the 3-mm wavelength band covering 75 to 111 ghz have been observed for about 10 galaxies using a new , very broadband receiver ( rsr ) with the fcrao 14 m radio telescope .",
    "interesting differences in line ratios are found , consistent with previous observations .",
    "when the rsr is mounted on the lmt in mexico , surveys of the chemistry of external galaxies will be possible .",
    "we note in this connection the suggestions that the variety of environments near the center of the milky way may serve as templates for unraveling the processes in external galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
