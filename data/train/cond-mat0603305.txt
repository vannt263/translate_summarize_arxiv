    "half - metallic ferromagnets ( hmf ) such as the semi - heusler nimnsb or the rutile cro@xmath1 are a subject of strongly growing interest mainly due to their potential applications in spin - dependent electronics , so - called `` spintoronics . ''",
    "@xcite concerning their electronic structure , half - metallic materials exhibit a gap in one spin channel and a normal metallic behavior for the opposite spin bands .",
    "this means that electrons at the fermi level are 100% spin polarized .",
    "much experimental effort is devoted to the semi - heusler nimnsb compound , although highly spin - polarized carrier injection has not yet been achieved . at low temperatures superconducting",
    "point contact measurements revealed a less then @xmath3 polarization of valence electrons .",
    "@xcite similar values were obtained by spin resolved photoemission ,  @xcite and more recently experiments using the synchrotron radiation showed at room temperature a 40% polarization at the fermi level .",
    "@xcite this discrepancy in comparison with the predicted half - metallic behavior is attributed to interface and surface effects . however , by a proper engineering , half - metalicity can be restored at surface / interfaces .  @xcite the experimental evidence for half - metallicity is stronger in cro@xmath1 : andreev reflection ,  @xcite superconducting tunneling ,  @xcite photoemission ,  @xcite and point - contact magnetoresistance ,  @xcite all give values of polarization in the range 85100 % .",
    "et al . _ have injected new excitement into the field of half metals , by reporting the existence of a spin triplet supercurrent through the strong ferromagnet cro@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite future spin electronic devices based on hmf will probably be expected to work around and above room temperature , so one of the essential requirements is that these ferromagnets should have quite high curie temperatures .",
    "both nimnsb ( @xmath4=730  k ) and cro@xmath1 ( @xmath4=400  k ) fulfill this requirement . a second essential requirement for using half - metallic materials in practical devices could be the understanding of finite - temperature behavior of spin polarization both from the experimental and the theoretical point of view .    on the theoretical side , hmf have been strongly supported by first - principles calculations , based on density - functional theory .",
    "@xcite these calculations offer a proper description of the ground state properties , and are usually performed for zero temperatures .",
    "one way to approach the finite temperature behavior is based on modeling the many - body interactions in the real material , therefore the evaluation of the model hamiltonian parameters is required .",
    "these parameters constitute the starting point for a finite - temperature full many - body microscopic description .",
    "the local density approximation ( lda ) electronic structure allows us to evaluate the effective hopping parameters , to which a hubbard type interaction is added to construct the starting hamiltonian . in the multiorbital case",
    "the hubbard hamiltonian is described by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the spin index , @xmath7 are local orbitals at site @xmath8 .",
    "the on - site coulomb interactions are expressed in terms of two parameters : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite this model hamiltonian is defined on a basis set of local orbitals and thus the microscopic interactions are local , involving a small number of electrons and a small number of orbitals .",
    "a numerically exact solution of this model is achieved by the quantum monte carlo solver in the framework of the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) .",
    "@xcite we used the recently developed lda+dmft methods  @xcite in order to investigate finite - temperature many - body effects for the practically important spintronic materials such as the semi - heuslers nimnsb ,  @xcite femnsb ,  @xcite and the zinc - blende cras ( ref .  ) and vas .",
    "@xcite in these materials , due to their half - metallic ferromagnetic band structure , the incoherent [ nonquasiaprticle ( nqp ) ] states play an important role .",
    "the nqp states were considered theoretically for the first time by edwards and hertz  @xcite in the framework of broad - band hubbard model for itinerant electron ferromagnets .    for the realistic electronic structure of nimnsb nqp states",
    "are situated just above the fermi level for the minority spin channel , having a considerable spectral weight .",
    "@xcite in femnsb the spectral weight of nqp states is enhanced in comparison with nimnsb , producing a drastic depolarization at the fermi level .",
    "@xcite for cras in the zinc - blende structure ,  @xcite the spectral weight of nqp states was studied in connection with the substrate lattice parameter . for large substrate lattice parameters",
    "the fermi level is situated close to the middle of the minority spin gap and the nqp states are clearly visible .",
    "however , for smaller substrate lattice parameters the nqp contribution is negligible .",
    "vas in a similar zinc - blende structure is predicted by lda / gga to be a narrow gap semiconductor .",
    "@xcite in addition to the presence of nqp states , many - body interactions determine the closure of the semiconducting majority spin gap , leading to a half - metallic ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "@xcite therefore , a correct prediction of new spintronic materials should take into account finite - temperature many - body correlation effects , which might play an essential role in depolarization .    in order to further investigate the nature of the nqp state",
    ", a realistic model hamiltonian is required . in this paper",
