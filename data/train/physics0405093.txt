    "linearly polarized laser pulses of intensities higher than @xmath0 and only a few cycles are of vital importance to several areas of physics , being applicable to , for instance , solid - state physics @xcite , high - frequency sources @xcite , or isolated attosecond pulses @xcite .",
    "only the latter application led to a breakthrough in metrology , making it possible to trace the motion of bound electrons metrology , to probe molecular dynamics @xcite , and to control electron emission @xcite . in this pulse - length regime , the phase difference between the pulse envelope and its carrier frequency , known as `` absolute phase '' , has a major influence on strong - field optical phenomena , such as high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) @xcite , or above - threshold ionization ( ati ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , the absolute phase affects , for instance , the harmonic or photoelectron yields , the maximal energies in both spectra and the time profiles of ati and hhg .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the physical mechanisms governing such phenomena , which occur in a subfemtosecond time scale , and for which the time dependence of the electric field is important .",
    "in fact , high - order harmonic generation is the outcome of a three - step process in which an electron leaves an atom by tunneling ionization at a time@xmath1 , propagates in the continuum , and recombines with its parent ion at a later instant @xmath2 , releasing the energy gained from the field in form of high - frequency radiation .",
    "a similar mechanism is also responsible for ati , with the main difference that the electron either rescatters elastically with its parent ion , or reaches the detector without recolliding , originating high- or low - energy peaks in the spectra , respectively .",
    "such a mechanism has been extensively studied both classically @xcite and quantum - mechanically @xcite .    from the experimental point of view ,",
    "controlling or measuring the absolute phase is a very difficult task @xcite .",
    "this has led to the proposal and experimental realization of schemes for its diagnosis , as , for instance , using the asymmetry in ati photoelectron counts reaching two opposite detectors placed in a plane perpendicular to the laser field fewcati2 .",
    "another phenomenon whose physical explanation lies on a laser - assisted rescattering process is nonsequential double ionization ( nsdi ) . in this case",
    ", an electron recollides inelastically with its parent ion , giving part of its kinetic energy to a second electron , which is thus able to overcome the second ionization potential and reach the continuum .",
    "fingerprints of such a mechanism were only revealed very recently , in experiments in which the momentum component parallel to the laser field polarization could be resolved , either for the doubly charged ion @xcite , or for both electrons @xcite .",
    "such features , namely a doubly - peaked structure in the momentum distributions , with maxima at @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the electron momentum components parallel to the laser field polarization and the ponderomotive energy @xcite , respectively , are , up to the present date , the most striking example of electron - electron correlation in the context of atoms in strong laser fields .",
    "this fact has led not only to further experiments @xcite , but also to a considerable theoretical activity on the subject , using quantum mechanical @xcite , semi - classical @xcite and classical @xcite methods .",
    "recently , we have shown that nsdi may serve as a powerful tool for absolute - phase measurements exploiting the fact that , for few - cycle driving pulses , inversion symmetry is broken @xcite .",
    "thus , the distributions in @xmath6 are mainly concentrated in the positive or negative momentum regions , changing from one region to the other upon a critical phase .",
    "such investigations have been performed classically , considering electrons released at times @xmath7 uniformly distributed throughout the pulse and weighted with the quasi - static tunneling rate @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we deal with this problem quantum - mechanically , and investigate the existence of a one - to - one correspondence with the classical model in ref .",
    "similar studies have been performed for nsdi with monochromatic driving fields , with practically identical outcomes @xcite .",
    "this has shown that , at least in the monochromatic case , which is a good approximation for the long pulses used in the experiments , intrinsically quantum - mechanical effects such as interference processes , or wave - packet spreading , are not important . however , it is legitimate to ask the question of whether this situation will persist in the few - cycle regime .",
    "indeed , it may well be that interference and wave - packet spreading play a more important role in this latter case . additionally , it is not clear whether the quasi - static tunneling rate considered in the classical model remains valid for few - cycle driving pulses .",
    "in fact , this has been recently put into question , with the derivation of a non - adiabatic rate @xcite .",
    "finally , it is worth checking whether asymmetric distributions and the critical phase also occur in a quantum - mechanical context , and , in case they do , to understand the physics behind .",
    "in particular , we address the above - stated questions using a @xmath8-matrix formalism , within the strong - field approximation ( sfa ) @xcite .",
    "we consider the simplest type of rescattering , namely electron - impact ionization , and treat the problem in terms of the so - called `` quantum orbits '' @xcite , which appear in the context of saddle - point approximations .",
    "specifically , we use a uniform approximation whose only validity requirement is that the orbits in question occur in pairs , which is in general the case for laser - assisted rescattering phenomena .",
    "this method has been previously applied to nsdi in monochromatic driving fields , in order to analyze the influence of the types of interaction and final - state electron correlation on the yields @xcite . apart from considerably simplifying the computations involved , as compared to other theoretical methods @xcite , the quantum - orbit approach provides additional physical insight , in terms of a space - time picture .",
    "in fact , the quantum orbits are closely related to the orbits of a classical electron in an external laser field .",
    "hence , in several situations , it is possible to draw a parallel betweeen our quantum - mechanical treatment and the previous classical considerations @xcite , discussing their similarities and differences . in the following , we study the physical mechanisms responsible for the critical phase within a quantum - mechanical framework , concentrating on the main differences from the classical picture and from the monochromatic - driving field case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section ( sec .",
    "[ backgrd ] ) , we provide the necessary theoretical background , presenting the transition amplitude in the strong - field and uniform approximations .",
    "subsequently , in sec .",
    "[ quantumorb ] , we present differential electron momentum distributions for various absolute phases , discussing the main features obtained in terms of quantum orbits .",
    "the quantum mechanical results are then compared to a classical ensemble computation which is either the same as in @xcite , or slightly modified with respect to it ( sec .",
    "classical ) . finally , in sec .",

    "thereby , this behavior was traced back to sets of electron trajectories , whose relevance was determined by the phase space , and by the rate with which the first electron was ejected in the continuum .",
    "a critical phase was related to a change in the dominant pair of orbits , which had a huge repercussion in the distributions .",

    "as the transverse momenta increase , the effective second ionization potential @xmath115 also becomes larger until this region collapses .",
    "an interesting feature is that , between the stokes transitions , the real parts of the rescattering and start times are centered around a particular value of @xmath116 which correspond to the peak of the momentum distributions .",

    "these imaginary parts noticeably increase at and beyond the stokes transitions , and remain practically constant in the momentum region inbetween .",

    ", this means that the first electron left with a larger tunneling probability at @xmath7 , in comparison to the orbits @xmath124 .",

    "an interesting situation occurs for @xmath158 , @xmath159for which , in principle , there exists two sets of times near which the electric field exhibits comparable maxima , corresponding to @xmath147 and @xmath142 . for low intensities",

    "however , electron - impact ionization is already allowed in this case , so that the critical phase is shifted towards smaller values .    in fig .",
    "8 , we explicitly show how electron - impact ionization becomes classically allowed or or forbidden upon a change in the driving - field intensity , for @xmath160 .",
    "in fact , as the intensity is decreased , this process ceases to be allowed for the orbits @xmath157 whose contributions lie near  the peak of the pulse ( c.f .",
    "7 ) . as a direct consequence",
    ", the critical phase is shifted towards larger absolute values as the intensity decreases , as shown in fig",
    "in this section , we will recall and apply the classical model used in fewcycleclass , performing a direct comparison with the results of the @xmath8-matrix computation .",
    "we consider an electron ensemble subject to the few - cycle pulse ( [ pulse ] ) , which are released from the origin of the coordinate system with initial vanishing drift velocities , i.e.,@xmath161the varying parameters are the tunneling times @xmath40 uniformly distributed throughout the pulse , and the quasi - static tunneling rate quasistatic @xmath162 /|e(t^{\\prime } ) | ,   \\label{quasistat}\\]]with which the electron counts are weighted .",
    "some of these electrons subsequently return to the origin and free a second electron ensemble at later times @xmath2 through electron - impact ionization .",
    "their return and rescattering conditions are given by eqs .",
    "( [ saddle3 ] ) and ( [ saddle2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "the yields are then given by    @xmath163    where @xmath164 is the kinetic energy of the electron upon return and the argument in the @xmath165 function gives the energy conservation at @xmath2 .",
    "this model is discussed in more detail in @xcite .    fig .",
    "9 presents the outcome of the classical computation , for the same parameters as in fig .",
    "1 . interestingly , both figures are very similar .",
    "indeed , there exist only minor differences near the boundaries of the classically allowed region , which occur for high intensities , as displayed in the lower panels of figs . 1 and 9 .",
    "such differences are due to the fact that the yield from the quantum - mechanical computation is exponentially decaying in the region for which electron - impact ionization is classically forbidden , whereas the distribution ( [ classicalyield ] ) immediately vanishes .",
    "such discrepancies were also present in the monochromatic case .",
    "further discrepancies occur for specific phases , in panels ( c ) and ( e ) of both figures , and show that the sign reversal starts to take place for slightly smaller absolute phases in the quantum - mechanical case .",
    "this effect can be understood if one keeps in mind that the critical phase indicates a change in the dominant set of trajectories , and that pre - requisites for this dominance are a large tunneling probability for the first electron and electron - impact ionization being classically allowed . in the particular example provided in the panels ( c ) and ( e ) of figs . 1 and 9 , this process has just become allowed for the orbits @xmath142 , within a small momentum region . in the quantum - mechanical case ( fig .",
    "1 ) , there exist contributions to the yield from near the boundary of such a region , even if rescattering is forbidden , whereas in the classical model ( fig .",
    "9 ) such contributions vanish .",
    "obviously , such discrepancies are absent in the symmetric momentum distributions obtained in the monochromatic case .    for monochromatic driving fields ,",
    "a very good agreement has also been reported in previous publications @xcite .",
    "it is not obvious , however , that this would remain true in the few - cycle regime .",
    "in fact , apart from yielding distributions which immediately vanish at the boundaries of the classically allowed region , the classical model does not take into account several effects which are present in the quantum - mechanical computation .",
    "examples of such effects are the quantum interference between different possible paths for the returning electron , or the spread of the electron wave packet .",
    "furthermore , the classical model considers an additional approximation with respect to the @xmath8-matrix computation , namely eq .",
    "( quasistat ) , which is a quasi - static , cycle - averaged tunneling rate .",
    "this rate is a key ingredient in the distributions given by eq .",
    "( [ classicalyield ] ) , and vital for the phase - dependence observed in fig . 9 ( c.f .",
    "10 and discussions in @xcite )",
    ". however , its validity may be limited or even questionable in the few - cycle regime .",
    "indeed , recently , a non - adiabatic rate that should be more accurate in this case has been derived @xcite . in general",
    ", the non - adiabatic rate tends to broaden the time range for which the relevance of sets of orbits persists .",
    "we verified , however , that this rate does not modify the yields for the parameter range in question .",
    "discrepancies between the quasi - static and the non - adiabatic rate occur only when the keldysh parameter @xmath166 is much larger than unity . in this case",
    ", the driving - field intensity would be far too low for the rescattering process discussed in this paper to be allowed , and thus for the classical model to be applicable . for measurements of nsdi yields below the threshold",
    "see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .        the subsequent picture ( fig .",
    "10 ) is the classical counterpart of fig .",
    "6 , providing an interpretation of fig . 9 in terms of the interplay between the ionization rate ( [ quasistat ] ) and the phase space .",
    "thereby , as in the quantum - mechanical case , we consider parallel momenta along the diagonal @xmath167 and vanishing transverse momenta .",
    "the main contributions to the yield come from pairs of trajectories for which the tunneling probability is large , and for which electron - impact ionization is classically allowed . in the figure , according to such criteria , it is possible to identify two sets of relevant orbits , corresponding to electrons ejected at @xmath168 , with positive parallel momenta , and to electrons released at @xmath169 , with negative parallel momenta .    according to the absolute phase , similarly to the quantum - mechanical case , there exist three distinct types of behavior . for @xmath170 ,",
    "apart from the fact that the classically allowed region is almost vanishing for the orbits @xmath142 , the quasi - static rate ( [ quasistat ] ) is considerably larger for the former set of electrons , so that the distributions are concentrated in the positive momentum regions . around @xmath130 ,",
    "such tunneling rates are comparable for both sets of orbits , resulting in nonvanishing yields for positive and negative parallel momenta . finally , as the phase increases , tunneling is more prominent for the latter set of orbits , and the distributions gradually change towards negative momenta .",
    "as in the previous section , the critical phase marks a change in the dominant orbits .",
    "this is in agreement with fig .",

    "11 , are also in very good agreement with its quantum - mechanical counterpart ( fig",
    "however , the distributions computed with the classical model are narrower than those obtained using the quantum - mechanical computation .",
    "this is once more related to the fact that , in a classical framework , the contributions from the forbidden momentum region can not be taken into account .    , @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively .",

    "for instance , around @xmath177 there is a transition in the momentum distributions from the third to the first quadrant in the @xmath178 plane , i.e. , exactly in the opposite direction as the transition in figs . 1 and 9 .",
    "furthermore , the upper and lower panels in fig .",
    "12 look exactly the same , if the first and the third quadrant are interchanged .",
    "this shows that there is a symmetry in the momentum distributions , which is due to the fact that @xmath179 so that @xmath180",
    "the studies performed in this paper clearly show that nonsequential double ionization with few - cycle pulses is a powerful tool for absolute - phase measurements . more specifically",
    ", the yields , as functions of the electron momentum components @xmath178 parallel to the laser - field polarization , are mainly concentrated either in the positive or negative momentum region , depending on the absolute phase in question . around a critical phase , such distributions start to shift from one momentum region to the other , until , as the phase increases , complete sign reversal in the momenta occurs .",
    "such features , obtained considering @xmath181 electron - impact ionization within a quantum - mechanical @xmath8-matrix framework , are interpreted in terms of the so - called quantum orbits , which can be directly associated to the trajectories of classical electrons . both the asymmetry and the critical phase result from the interplay between phase - space effects , and the probability that the first electron leaves its parent ion through tunneling ionization .",
    "the former and the latter , respectively , determine whether electron - impact ionization is classically allowed or forbidden , or the relevance of a set of orbits to the yield .",
    "the huge effects observed , namely the yields vanishing or appearing over extense and well - separated regions in the @xmath178 plane , are a due to a particular characteristic of the rescattering process in question , for which , in addition to a maximal , there is also a minimal classically allowed energy . in other words ,",
    "electron - impact ionization is allowed only within confined phase - space regions , defined by the radius in eq .",
    "( [ saddle4 ] ) . by varying the driving - field intensity and the absolute phase adequately",
    ", this radius can be forced to vanish , so that a whole phase - space region would become classically forbidden .",
    "furthermore , a particular region can be made irrelevant due to a small tunneling probability for the first electron .",
    "this is a major advantage over other phenomena occurring in the context of strong - laser field matter interaction , such as above - threshold ionization and high - order harmonic generation . for both phenomena ,",
    "there are only maximal classically allowed energies , so that these effects do not occur .",
    "apart from providing support for previous classical computations fewcycleclass , the present results allow one to establish a one - to - one correspondence between the classical and the quantum - mechanical approaches .",
    "tunneling , for instance , is incorporated in the classical model using the quasi - static rate ( [ quasistat ] ) which weights the electron counts . in the @xmath8-matrix computation , this process is directly related to the imaginary parts of the start times @xmath182 both the quasi - static rate and @xmath183 $ ] are somehow a measure of the relevance of a set of orbits .",
    "indeed , dominant contributions always come from pairs of orbits for which eq.([quasistat ] ) is larger , or @xmath184 $ ] are smaller than those from the remaining pairs .",
    "depending on the absolute phase , this may occur for a single set of orbits , whose contributions lie either in the negative or in the positive momentum regions , or there may be sets of orbits whose contributions compete .",
    "a critical phase characterizes a change in the dominant set of orbits .",
    "furthermore , the phase - space effects which occur if electron - impact ionization becomes classically forbidden , i.e. , if the radius in eq .",
    "( [ saddle4 ] ) collapses , are present in both frameworks in very similar , though not entirely identical , ways . in the classical computation",
    ", this would lead to vanishing yields , since the condition in the argument of the  @xmath165 function in eq .",
    "( [ classicalyield ] ) would never be fulfilled . in the quantum - mechanical model",
    ", there would be exponentially decaying contributions throughout .",
    "if this radius does not collapse , the process will be allowed within a confined phase - space region . in the classical case ,",
    "the start and return times coalesce at the boundaries of this region , whereas , quantum - mechanically , this does not completely happen .",
    "the above - stated effects explain the minor discrepancies between figs . 1 and 9 .",
    "in particular , two types of discrepancies have been observed .",
    "first , for high driving - field intensities , the distributions obtained with the quantum - mechanical computation are slightly broader than those from the classical model .",
    "second , in the quantum - mechanical framework , the distributions start to shift at a slightly smaller phase , as compared to the outcome of the classical simulation .",
    "the former differences were also present in nsdi with monochromatic driving fields , whereas the latter discrepancies are specific to asymmetric momentum distributions , which occur , for instance , in the context of few - cycle driving pulses .",
    "the agreement between both the quantum - mechanical and the classical computations go beyond the physical explanations for the asymmetry and the critical phase .",
    "indeed , the momentum distributions computed with the one or the other method , as well as the predicted critical phase and the interval in which the momenta change sign , are very similar , apart from minor differences near the classical boundaries .",
    "this is a concrete evidence that the effects reported in this paper are not rooted on a particular model or framework , being , on the contrary , of a deeper physical nature .",
    "in fact , recently , a similar asymmetry has been observed in ongoing nsdi experiments with few - cycle driving pulses @xcite .",
