    "@xmath8 is made into a metric space by identifying each @xmath12-simplex with the standard simplex in @xmath13 with unit length edges ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "masur and minsky in @xcite showed that there is some @xmath14 such that @xmath0 is @xmath3-hyperbolic , meaning that geodesic triangles in @xmath8 are @xmath15 : any edge is contained in the @xmath3-neighborhood of the union of the other two edges .",
    "bowditch reproved this result in @xcite , showing that the hyperbolicity constant @xmath3 grows no faster than logarithmically in @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",

    "note that @xmath8 is quasi - isometric to @xmath18 , however the quasi - constants depend on the underlying surface .",
    "therefore theorem @xmath20 does not imply the uniform hyperbolicity of @xmath8 .",
    "we also note that it has recently come to the author s attention that brian bowditch has independently obtained the same result @xcite , as have clay , rafi , and schleimer using different methods @xcite .",

    "that @xmath24 is a disconnected surface , define @xmath23 to be the sum of the complexity of its connected components . if @xmath25 , @xmath24 is called @xmath26 and each component of @xmath24 possesses one of finitely many well understood topological types . in truth , the definition of @xmath8 needs to be modified when @xmath24 is sporadic and connected ( see @xcite for details ) , because it is exactly these surfaces for which no two simple closed curves are disjoint .    in what follows",

    ", we define the numbers @xmath42 as follows : @xmath43 irrespective of @xmath44 , curve complex distance is bounded above by a logarithmic function of intersection number , and therefore if we fix @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath42 grows exponentially as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "but one may also study @xmath42 as a function of @xmath1 or @xmath2 :    how does @xmath42 grow as a function of @xmath44 ?",
    "the content of theorem @xmath41 is that @xmath42 eventually grows faster than @xmath45 as a function of @xmath44 for any @xmath34 .",
    "we conclude the paper with two further applications of theorem @xmath41 , the first being the resolution of a question posed by masur and minsky in @xcite regarding vertex cycles of train tracks on surfaces ( see section @xmath46 for relevant definitions ) .",
    "specifically they ask :    as a consequence of the fact that there are only finitely many train tracks on a surface @xmath24 up to combinatorial equivalence , there is a bound @xmath47 depending only on the topology of @xmath24 such that    @xmath48 if @xmath49 are two vertex cycles of the same train track @xmath50 .",
    "can @xmath51 be made independent of @xmath24 ?",
    "that is , is there some @xmath52 such that , for any choice of @xmath24 , the curve complex distance between two vertex cycles of the same train track on @xmath24 is no more than @xmath51 ?    in section 5 , we show    let @xmath53 be a train track , and let @xmath54 be vertex cycles of @xmath50",
    ". then if @xmath55 is sufficiently large , @xmath56    in what follows , let @xmath57 denote the teichmller space of @xmath24 , the space of marked riemann surfaces homeomorphic to @xmath24 , modulo conformal equivalence isotopic to the identity . for the remainder of this paper",
    ", we will be concerned with the topology on @xmath57 induced by the _",
    "teichmller metric _ , denoted by @xmath58 . in this metric ,",
    "the distance between two marked riemann surfaces @xmath31 and @xmath32 is determined by the minimal dilatation constant associated to a quasiconformal map isotopic to the identity between @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "in the final section , we consider the map @xmath59 introduced by masur and minsky in @xcite ; here @xmath60 is the set of isotopy classes of simple closed curves minimizing the extremal length in the conformal class of @xmath31 .",
    "note that @xmath61 is technically a map into @xmath62 ( the power set of @xmath63 ) , but @xmath64 is uniformly bounded , and what s more , there exists some @xmath65 so that if @xmath66 are riemann surfaces within @xmath67 of each other in @xmath57 , then @xmath68 a map @xmath69 from @xmath57 to @xmath8 is then constructed by defining @xmath70 to be any element of @xmath60 ; an immediate consequence of the existence of @xmath71 is that @xmath69 is coarsely lipschitz : for any @xmath72 , @xmath73    in the final section , we show that @xmath71 can be taken to be independent of @xmath24 :    there exists @xmath74 so that for any choice of @xmath6 , @xmath75 for any @xmath76 .",
    "in other words , the map sending a riemann surface to any curve in @xmath8 with minimal extremal length is coarsely lipschitz , with lipschitz contants independent of the choice of @xmath24 .    *",
    "how uniform hyperbolicity follows from theorem @xmath41 *    in both proofs of hyperbolicity of @xmath77 by masur - minsky and bowditch , the method of proof is to construct a family of quasigeodesics satisfying certain properties .    in @xcite ,",
    "masur and minsky show the existence of a coarsely transitive family of quasigeodesics @xmath78 ( images of teichmller geodesics under the above - mentioned map ) equipped with projection maps @xmath79 , essentially having the property that the diameter of @xmath80 is bounded , with the bound depending only on @xmath24 and @xmath81 . here",
    "@xmath82 denotes the tubular neighborhood of radius @xmath83 .",
    "it is then demonstrated that this is a sufficient condition for @xmath3-hyperbolicity . in @xcite , bowditch constructs a similar family of uniform quasigeodesics and uses them to show that @xmath8 satisfies a subquadratic isoperimetric inequality , also implying @xmath3-hyperbolicity .",
    "each approach has its own implications ; the masur - minsky program emphasizes greatly the connection between the geometry of the curve complex and that of teichmller and hyperbolic space . indeed , in order to prove the projection property mentioned above , they show a host of independently interesting results regarding the structure and combinatorics of train tracks on surfaces and teichmller geometry .",
    "in contrast , bowditch s approach yields more control on the actual size of the hyperbolicity constant .    specifically , both bowditch and masur - minsky rely on a key lemma , that every unit area singular euclidean surface homeomorphic to @xmath24 contains an annulus of definite width @xmath84 . masur and minsky",
    "prove this lemma using a limiting argument , while bowditch s proof is more effective and yields some quantitative control on the growth of @xmath85 as a function of @xmath24 .",
    "uniform hyperbolicity of @xmath86 follows if one plugs the result of theorem @xmath41 into bowditch s more effective set - up , as is demonstrated in section @xmath87 .",
    "we note that , while the conclusion of theorem @xmath41 suffices to prove theorem @xmath20 , we conjecture that this lower bound can be improved :    let @xmath88 be as in the statement of theorem @xmath20 .",
    "then there exists a polynomial @xmath89 of degree @xmath90 such that @xmath91    * organization of the paper . * in section @xmath92",
    ", we establish theorem @xmath41 for @xmath93 which is used in section @xmath94 as the base case of an induction argument on the curve complex distance . in section @xmath94 , we complete the proof of theorem @xmath41 , and in section @xmath87 we show how theorem @xmath20 immediately follows from theorem @xmath41 , together with the extensive quantitative control that bowditch obtains on the growth of the hyperbolicity constant in his original proof . in section @xmath46",

    "let @xmath98 be a collection of curves on @xmath9 in pairwise _ minimal position _ , meaning that for each @xmath99 , @xmath100 we say that such a collection _ fills _ the surface if the complement @xmath101 is a union of topological disks and once - punctured disks .",
    "equivalently , @xmath102 fills if every homotopically non - trivial , non - peripheral ( i.e. , not homotopic into a neighborhood of a puncture ) simple isotopy class has a nonzero geometric intersection number with atleast one member of @xmath102 .",
    "henceforth , we will use the word _ essential _ to refer to any curve which is non - peripheral and homotopically non - trivial .",
    "the study of question 1 began with the following simpler question :    on @xmath9 , how many times does a pair of simple closed curves need to intersect in order to fill ?",
    "note that two simple closed curves @xmath33 and @xmath29 fill if and only if @xmath103 , for this precisely means that there is no essential simple closed curve which is simultaneously disjoint from both @xmath33 and @xmath29 . in light of the notation used in the introduction , question @xmath94 can therefore be restated as a question about @xmath104 .",
    "@xmath105 .",
    "suppose @xmath33 and @xmath29 fill @xmath9 .",
    "then @xmath106 can be considered as the @xmath67-skeleton of a decomposition of @xmath9 into disks and once - punctured disks . letting @xmath107 denote the number of disks in this decomposition , we obtain @xmath108 the right hand side comes from the fact that there are twice as many edges as there are vertices in this decomposition , and the vertices are precisely the intersections between @xmath33 and @xmath29 . then since @xmath109 .",
    "in this section , we prove theorem @xmath41 :    * theorem 1.2 . *",

    "both @xmath112 and @xmath113 will be established in the course of the proof .",
    "thus we begin by assuming that @xmath36 are such that @xmath114    assume that @xmath33 and @xmath29 are in minimal position . cutting along @xmath33 yields @xmath115 , which is topologically either a genus @xmath116 surface with @xmath117 punctures , or @xmath118 has two connected components . after cutting , @xmath29 becomes a set @xmath51 of disjoint arcs @xmath119 with endpoints at the two punctures corresponding to @xmath33 .",
    "consider a maximal subcollection @xmath120 of pairwise non - isotopic arcs ; note that @xmath121 must fill @xmath118 and therefore there is some linear function @xmath122 which bounds @xmath123 from below .",

    "note that the number of complementary regions of the arcs in @xmath121 is also no larger than @xmath129 .",
    "the bottom line is that @xmath123 is bounded above and below by linear functions of @xmath44 :    @xmath130 * case 1 : the original surface @xmath24 is closed , so that @xmath131 * :    in this case , since @xmath121 fills @xmath118 , the collection of complementary components of @xmath121 in @xmath118 consists of a disjoint union of polygons , each having at least @xmath94 sides .",
    "the collection of complementary regions defines a dual graph @xmath132 , whose vertices @xmath133 correspond to complementary regions , and such that two vertices are connected by an edge if and ony if they represent adjacent ( across an arc in @xmath121 ) complementary regions in @xmath118 . for @xmath134 ,",

    "assume @xmath44 is sufficiently large so that @xmath147 ( this will be made more precise below . )",
    "then for all such surfaces , cutting along all large mass arcs yields a possibly disconnected , non - simply connected ( indeed , non - sporadic ) surface @xmath148 .",
    "this is because cutting along any arc @xmath141 in @xmath121 decreases the complexity by at most @xmath94 ; to see this , it suffices to analyze the three possible cases :    1 .",

    "the terminal punctures of @xmath141 are distinct .",
    "the complexity of the surface obtained by cutting along @xmath141 depends only on which of the three cases we are in ; the details of this are left to the reader , because the non - simply connectedness of @xmath148 is implied by the conclusion of the following lemma :    there exists @xmath149 such that if @xmath150 , there exists a homotopically non - trivial simple closed curve @xmath151 intersecting no more than @xmath113 arcs of @xmath121 .    in the statement of proposition @xmath152 , @xmath113 is the same function @xmath153 from the statement of theorem @xmath41 , and it will be determined in the course of the proof . as will be proven below , proposition @xmath152 asserts that @xmath154 is essential when viewed as a simple closed curve on the original surface @xmath24 , not just as a curve on @xmath148 .",

    "in this section , we briefly summarize bowditch s proof of hyperbolicity of @xmath8 as seen in @xcite , and then demonstrate how theorem @xmath20 follows from his set - up , with the use of theorem @xmath41 . to avoid confusion , when possible we will use the same notation he introduces in his original article .    define @xmath228 to be the set of _ weighted curves _ ; an element of @xmath228 is a pair    @xmath229    then @xmath230 , the set of @xmath231 is the set of all finite formal sums of elements of @xmath228 with pairwise disjoint summands .",
    "note that any element of @xmath232 is naturally considered as an element of either @xmath228 or @xmath230 by assigning unit weight .",
    "given @xmath233 , we can extend the notion of geometric intersection number for elements of @xmath63 to @xmath228 linearly @xmath234 and we can again extend linearly to @xmath230 . then for @xmath235 with @xmath236 , define    @xmath237,\\ ] ] and @xmath238.\\ ] ] then for any @xmath239 , we define    @xmath240 and @xmath241    note that @xmath242 . in section @xmath46 , bowditch shows that there exists an essential annulus of width atleast @xmath243 in any unit area singular euclidean surface of complexity @xmath44 , and uses this to show :    there exists @xmath244 such that @xmath245 .",
    "furthermore , one can choose @xmath187 so that @xmath246 .",
    "as a consequence of this , we obtain    there exists @xmath247 so that for any @xmath248 @xmath249    indeed , lemma @xmath250 follows immediately from the definitions and lemma @xmath251 :    there is some @xmath252 since it is non - empty .",
    "then for any @xmath253 , we have @xmath254    here , the first inequality is always true , independent of @xmath44 or the choice of @xmath154 and @xmath3 .",

    "bowditch then goes on to define the sets @xmath295 to essentially be the curve obtained by choosing an element of @xmath296 for each pair @xmath297 satisfying @xmath298 .",
    "hyperbolicity is proved by showing that for this choice of @xmath295 ( together with the choice of centers @xmath299 whose definition is not summarized here- see @xcite ) , the conditions of theorem @xmath293 are satisfied , with @xmath292 depending only on @xmath107 .",

    "@xmath300 is an embedded @xmath67-complex ; edges are called _ branches _ and vertices _ switches_. each edge is a smooth parameterized path with well - defined tangent vectors at the endpoints .",
    "furthermore , at each switch @xmath136 , there is a single line @xmath301 such that the tangent vector of any branch incident at @xmath136 lies on @xmath302 . for each switch @xmath136",
    ", we choose a preferred direction of @xmath302 ; a branch @xmath303 incident at @xmath136 is called _ incoming _ if its tangent vector at @xmath136 is aligned with the chosen direction , and _ outgoing _ otherwise .",
    "we require that the valence of each switch be at least @xmath94 , unless @xmath50 has a simple closed curve component @xmath71 ; in this case we have a single bivalent switch on @xmath71 .",
    "any component @xmath304 of @xmath305 is a surface with boundary consisting of smooth arcs running between cusps .",
    "we define the @xmath306 of @xmath304 to be @xmath307 where @xmath308 is the number of cusps on @xmath309 .",
    "we require that the generalized euler characteristic of each component of @xmath310 be negative .",
    "a _ train path _ is a smooth sub - path of @xmath50 which traverses a switch only by entering via an incoming branch and exiting via an outgoing branch . given a train track @xmath50 ,",
    "let @xmath311 denote the set of branches .",
    "a non - negative , real - valued function @xmath312 is called a @xmath313 on @xmath50 if for each switch @xmath136 , it satisfies @xmath314 where @xmath315 is the set of incoming branches at @xmath136 , @xmath316 the set of outgoing branches .",
    "these are called the _ switch conditions_.    @xmath50 is called _ recurrent _ if it admits a transverse measure with all positive weights , and _ transversely recurrent _ if , for each branch @xmath303 , there exists a simple closed curve @xmath317 intersecting @xmath303 , which intersects @xmath50 transversely and is such that @xmath318 has no bigons .",
    "@xmath50 is called _ birecurrent _ if it is both recurrent and transversely recurrent , and _ generic _ if all switches are at most trivalent .",
    "if @xmath319 is a transverse measure on @xmath50 , then so is @xmath320 for any @xmath321 because the switch conditions are linear .",
    "it follows that the set of all transverse measures , viewed as a subset of @xmath322 , is a cone over a compact polyhedron in projective space .",
    "thus , it is often preferable to consider projective classes of transverse measures .",
    "let @xmath323 denote the projective polyhedron of transverse measures ; the class @xmath324\\in p(\\tau)$ ] is called a _",
    "vertex cycle _ of @xmath50 if it is an extreme point of @xmath323 , that is to say that it can not be written as a non - trivial convex combination of two other projective classes of measures in @xmath323 .",
    "a geodesic lamination @xmath325 is _ carried _ by @xmath50 if there is a @xmath326 map @xmath327 which is isotopic to the identity , and such that the restriction of the differential @xmath328 to any tangent line of @xmath325 is non - singular ; this amounts to saying that @xmath329 is a train path on @xmath50 .",
    "suppose @xmath71 is a simple closed curve carried by @xmath50 .",
    "then @xmath71 induces a transverse measure called the _ counting measure _ : each branch @xmath303 of @xmath50 is assigned the integer corresponding to the number of times @xmath71 traverses @xmath303",
    ".    in general , if @xmath330 $ ] is a vertex cycle of @xmath50 , @xmath330 $ ] has a unique representative that is the counting measure on a simple closed curve @xmath71 carried by @xmath50 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus if @xmath331,[v_{2}]$ ] are two vertex cycles of a train track @xmath50 , we can define @xmath332,[v_{2}])$ ] to be the curve graph distance between their simple closed curve representatives .    in order to prove the results regarding nested train tracks needed to show hyperbolicity of @xmath77 in @xcite , masur and minsky rely on the fact that there is a bound @xmath47 such that any two vertex cycles of the same train track are a distance of at most @xmath51 from one another , which is an immediate consequence of the fact that there are only finitely many train tracks on @xmath24 up to homeomorphism .",
    "however they conjecture that @xmath51 can be made independent of @xmath24 , and conjecture further that @xmath333 suffices .    using theorem @xmath41",
    ", we will show :    * theorem 1.3*. _ let @xmath53 be a train track , and let @xmath54 be vertex cycles of @xmath50 . then if @xmath334 is sufficiently large , _",
    "@xmath56    we note that this constant @xmath51 also occurs in the proof of the quasiconvexity of the disk set by masur and minsky in @xcite .",
    "_ proof _ : we can assume that @xmath50 is generic and birecurrent since for any train track @xmath50 , there exists a generic birecurrent track @xmath335 such that @xmath336 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "assume @xmath337 , and assume further that @xmath338 .",
    "then by theorem @xmath41 , @xmath339    we will need the following fact about vertex cycles ( see @xcite for proof ) :    if @xmath33 is a simple closed curve representative of a vertex cycle @xmath330 $ ] of @xmath50 , then if @xmath340 is the associated carrying map , @xmath341 traverses each branch of @xmath50 at most twice , and never twice in the same direction .",
    "since @xmath50 is birecurrent , for any @xmath81 , there exists a hyperbolic metric @xmath342 on @xmath24 so that @xmath50 has geodesic curvature less than @xmath83 with respect to @xmath342 @xcite .",

    "by lemma @xmath350 , @xmath343 and @xmath344 can each enter @xmath348 at most twice .",
