    "<S> in this paper , we investigate the possibility of measuring the purity of a quantum state ( and the overlap between two quantum states ) within a minimal model where the measurement device is minimally composed . </S>",
    "<S> the minimality is based on the assumptions that ( i ) we use a yes - no measurement on a single system to determine the single value of the purity in order not to extract other redundant information , and ( ii ) we use neither ancilla nor random measurement . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the measurability of the purity within this model critically depends on the parity of dimension of the quantum system : the purity measurement is possible for odd dimensional quantum systems , while it is impossible for even dimensional cases . </S>"
