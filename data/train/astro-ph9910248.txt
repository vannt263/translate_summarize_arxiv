    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the disk of the milky way ( and other spirals ) is made up of several thermal `` phases , '' each with a characteristic density and temperature depending on the prevailing physical conditions ( field , goldsmith , & habing 1969 ; mckee & ostriker 1977 ) .",
    "the principal phases of the neutral material in the disks of spiral galaxies , the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) and the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) , are expected to exist in rough pressure equilibrium , embedded in the warm and hot ionized phases of the ism . under the right conditions ,",
    "the cnm can include a molecular component from which young stars form .",
    "the conditions in the equilibrium neutral media are dictated by the ambient pressure and the detailed heating and cooling processes in the media ( see , e.g. , mckee & ostriker 1977 ; wolfire et al .",
    "this is even the case in the self - gravitating molecular clouds in spirals given the external pressure term in the virial equation ( see elmegreen 1999 ) .    in the `` standard '' models of thermal phase equilibrium in the neutral media ,",
    "the most important heating source is the photoejection of electrons from the surfaces of interstellar dust grains ( bakes & tielens 1994 ; wolfire et al .",
    "grains are also important as potential coolants ( e.g. , by recombination of electrons and ions on their surfaces ) , and in certain conditions may significantly affect the thermal balance of a medium by the removal of heavy elements from the gas - phase . thus interstellar grains play an important role in the physics of the ism in the thin gaseous disks of galaxies .",
    "their influence on the thermal state of the gas helps determine the phase structure of the medium , and grains go on to play an important role in the star formation process within the dense ism .",
    "our understanding of the physical conditions of neutral clouds in the halos of galaxies is less well developed .",
    "from a theoretical standpoint , clouds far from the planes of spiral galaxies should behave similarly to clouds in the disk , with the same heating and cooling mechanisms and possibly similar phase structure ( wolfire et al .",
    "1995a , b ) . given the importance of dust grains to the thermal physics of clouds at small heights , @xmath3 , from the midplane , knowledge of the dust content of high-@xmath3  material is essential if we are also to understand clouds in the halos and thick disks of spiral galaxies .",
    "much of the material in the halo and thick disk of a spiral galaxy is thought to originate in the thin interstellar disk .",
    "the processes that circulate matter between the thin disks and halos of spiral galaxies operate on both gas _ and _ dust .",
    "however , depending on the method of ejection of matter from the thin interstellar disk and the resiliency of dust grains to destruction by various means ( jones et al .",
    "1994 ) , the dust content of halo material may be different than that of the disk .",
    "this can have important implications for the thermal phase structure and physics of high-@xmath3  gas ( wolfire et al.1995a , b ) .    in our own galaxy",
    "there is evidence from gas - phase abundances that individual h@xmath10i  clouds at relatively large distances from the plane contain dust ( sembach & savage 1996 ; savage & sembach 1996 , and references therein ) .",
    "there is also evidence for the existence of dust grains in the thickened warm ionized medium or `` reynolds layer '' of the galaxy ( howk & savage 1999a ; lagache et al .  1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "it would therefore seem that the processes responsible for lifting the observed gas clouds out of the plane of the galaxy also affect the dust . and",
    "though the dust in the galactic halo may be to some extent processed , or partially destroyed , the evidence suggests this destruction is not total .",
    "observations of external galaxies have revealed extensive thickened layers of ionized gas traced by its h@xmath0  emission in several edge - on spiral systems ( e.g. , rand , kulkarni , & hester 1990 , 1992 ; dettmar 1990 ; rand 1996 ; ferguson , wyse , & gallagher 1996 ; hoopes , walterbos , & rand 1999 ) .",
    "these extraplanar layers of so - called diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) are thought to be similar to the reynolds layer of warm ionized material in the galaxy ( reynolds 1991 ) . among the most spectacular examples of extraplanar dig",
    "is seen in the nearby ( @xmath12 mpc ) edge - on sb galaxy ngc  891 ( dettmar 1990 ; rand et al.1990 ; keppel et al .",
    "1991 ; rand 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "the observed h@xmath0emission from this galaxy implies an ionized gas layer with multiple electron scale - heights of @xmath13 and @xmath14 kpc ( hoopes et al.1999 ; rand 1997 ) .",
    "the dust effects the observed quantity and distribution of emission from gas and stars in the thick disk of ngc  891 . ]    in howk & savage ( 1997 , hereafter paper  i ) we intiated a program to study extraplanar dust in edge - on spiral galaxies .",
    "we presented high - resolution optical images of the nearby galaxy ngc  891 taken with the wiyn 3.5-m telescope at kitt peak national observatory .",
    "these images reveal extensive amounts of highly - structured dust seen in absorption against the background stellar light of the galaxy .",
    "the high - resolution wiyn images show hundreds of individual dust - bearing clouds observable to heights @xmath15 kpc from the midplane along the entire observed length of the galaxy . to denote the distance from the midplane . unless the value in question refers to a single structure , we will be implicitly assuming @xmath16 in our discussion , meaning that the value @xmath3 refers to distances from the midplane to either side of the galaxy . ]",
    "a very simple analysis of the radiative transfer suggests these dust structures are relatively opaque ( @xmath17 to 2.0 ) .",
    "assuming gas - to - dust relationships appropriate for the disk of the milky way ( bohlin , savage , & drake 1978 ) are applicable to these clouds , the inferred hydrogen column densities were in excess of @xmath18 atoms @xmath19 , implying quite large masses ( @xmath20 to 10@xmath21 m@xmath6 ) .",
    "estimates for the potential energies of the observed dusty clouds relative to the midplane are in the range @xmath22 ergs , similar to the energy estimates derived for galactic supershells ( heiles 1979 ) .",
    "the implied total gas mass associated with the ensemble of dusty high-@xmath3  clouds is roughly similar to that estimated for the mass of the extraplanar dig in ngc  891 ( @xmath23 m@xmath6 ; dettmar 1990 ) .",
    "the images presented in paper  i  clearly show a substantial amount of dust is present in the thick disk of ngc  891 .",
    "subsequent observations by alton et al .",
    "( 1998 ) using the scuba submillimeter bolometer have detected @xmath24 m emission from extraplanar dust to heights @xmath25 kpc in ngc  891 .",
    "the mere presence of the dust features discussed in paper  i  imply that the mechanism(s ) responsible for transporting material from the thin interstellar disk into the more extended thick disk of ngc  891 does not destroy the grains .",
    "we refer the reader to paper  i  for a detailed discussion of the various mechanisms that may be at work in lifting gas and dust out of the thin disks of spirals .    in our second paper of this series ( howk & savage 1999b , hereafter paper  ii )",
    ", we studied the frequency of such extraplanar dust features in normal spiral galaxies .",
    "based on a small wiyn imaging survey of all the massive , edge - on spirals within @xmath26 mpc observable from the north , paper  ii  showed that the presence of extraplanar dust is relatively common in normal spiral galaxies , with more than half of the galaxies in our final sample exhibiting prominent extraplanar dust structures .",
    "furthermore , in the galaxies of this survey that had previously been searched for extraplanar dig , paper  ii  showed a one - to - one correlation between the presence ( or absence ) of high-@xmath3dust structures and the presence ( or absence ) of high-@xmath3  dig .",
    "thus galaxies showing extended regions of h@xmath0  emission far from the plane also showed highly - structured dust clouds visible in our broadband images .",
    "the interpretation of the statistical correlation between the high-@xmath3dust structures and the dig is not clear . in general",
    "those galaxies showing high-@xmath3  dust seemed to be relatively uniform in the properties of the dust - bearing clouds , while the h@xmath0  morphologies and brightnesses showed significant variation ( see rand 1996 and pildis , schombert , & bregman 1994 ) .",
    "the discussion presented in paper  ii  argued that the extraplanar dust features seen in these edge - on spirals likely trace a dense phase of the ism at high-@xmath3 , separate and physically distinct from the extraplanar dig .",
    "several lines of evidence were used to argue for such a configuration , though this conclusion was primarily based on the rough column density estimates for the dusty structures and on the general lack of morphological similarity between the dust - bearing and h@xmath0-emitting material .",
    "the implied column densities with the observed dimensions of the structures yielded crude estimates of the particle density that were irreconcilable with the expected densities of the extraplanar dig .",
    "the dig at @xmath27 kpc is expected to have local electron densities of order @xmath28 assuming a volume filling factor of @xmath29 ( rand 1997 ) .",
    "the dust features are only detectable in these images because they are significantly denser than their surroundings .",
    "estimates of the particle densities in the extraplanar clouds traced by the dust absorption in the galaxies observed in paper  iiare in the range @xmath30 @xmath31 .    while there is now evidence for a statistical relationship between the the presence of extraplanar h@xmath0  emission and high-@xmath3  dust absorption , there is as of yet little information on any physical relationship between the dig and dust within an individual galaxy .",
    "are these observational tracers measuring the same high-@xmath3  material , or do they each give insight into a separate phase of the thick disk or halo ism ? in this paper we present much deeper observations of ngc  891 in the bvi bands than the data of paper  i. we also present deep , high - resolution narrowband ( h@xmath0 + [ ] ) images of ionized gas emission from this galaxy .",
    "the purposes of these observations are to probe the known dust structures in this galaxy as far from the midplane as possible , and to directly investigate the physical relationship between the dust features and the dig in the disk - halo interface of ngc  891 .",
    "our presentation is arranged as follows . in  [ sec : observations ] we present a summary of our observations and data processing .",
    "this includes a description of our unsharp masking technique .",
    "the results of our broadband imaging , and the implications for the extraplanar dust structures , are presented in  [ sec : thickdisk ] .",
    "our h@xmath0  images are discussed in  [",
    "sec : halpha ] , including a direct comparison of the h@xmath0emission from ngc  891 and the morphology of the absorbing dust structures .",
    "the implications of the observations , and in particular the comparison of the h@xmath0  and dust morphologies , are discussed in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "that comparison shows that these two observational tracers , the dust absorption and the h@xmath0  emission , are revealing two different interstellar phases in the multiphase halo of ngc  891 .",
    "we summarize the major results of this work in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "all of the observations presented here were obtained with the wiyn 3.5-m telescope at kitt peak national observatory in the fall of 1997 , though we have also included some of the data from paper  i  in our analysis , which were taken 1996 december 4 ( ut ) .",
    "a log of our observations is given in table [ table : log ] .",
    "this table shows the filter used , the date of observation , and the seeing - limited resolution , expressed as the fwhm ( in arcseconds ) of gaussian fits to the stellar images using the iraf routine imexam , for each exposure .",
    "the images presented here were taken under non - photometric conditions .",
    "our analysis depends only on measures of the relative intensity and does not require photometric calibration ( see paper  i ) .",
    "the wiyn imager in use at the time of our observations is a thinned 2048@xmath322048 stis ccd with 21 @xmath33 m pixels .",
    "placed at the f/6.5 nasmyth focus of the wiyn telescope , the imager has a @xmath34 field of view , with each pixel subtending @xmath35 on the sky .",
    "the images have been bias - subtracted and flat field - corrected in the usual manner within iraf .",
    "the flat fields were derived from observations of the `` great white spot '' in the telescope dome . in principle subtle variations in the flat - field of the image could mimic dust absorption in ngc  891 ( though very few of the dust features we observe can be referred to as `` subtle '' ) .",
    "our experience suggests that the dome flats can adequately remove small - scale structures associated with the ccd . in the course of our observing we moved the center of the ccd relative to the galaxy by @xmath36 with each new exposure .",
    "this shifts any instrumental flat field features relative to the galaxy .",
    "each individual image was registered to a common reference frame using the positions of foreground stars .",
    "the rms errors in the alignment of the images are typically @xmath37 of a pixel . in the resulting coadded data ,",
    "the effects of any artifacts associated with the flat field structure of the ccd should be greatly diminished .",
    "we have found no real evidence , when comparing our final coadded images with the individual exposures , for confusion of flat - field features with absorbing dust structures .",
    "table [ table : finalimages ] gives the properties of our final coadded images , including the final angular resolution of the images .",
    "each image was smoothed with a gaussian to the worst resolution in a given band before coaddition . for comparison , at the distance of ngc  891 ( @xmath38 mpc ; tully 1988 ) , @xmath39 corresponds to @xmath40 pc .",
    "the narrowband images will be described more fully in ",
    "[ subsec : narrow ] .",
    "removal of cosmic rays in the images was performed using standard sigma - clipping algorithms within iraf .",
    "we have derived the astrometric plate solution for our images using a grid of stars whose coordinates were measured in the digitized sky survey .",
    "the rms error in using the plate solution to derive coordinates is approximately 10 .",
    "the sky background in each frame is estimated by fitting a planar ( or in a few cases quadratic ) surface to regions of the images free from light of the galaxy .",
    "stars in these regions have been removed using a median smoothing technique .",
    "this approach is somewhat problematic given the galaxy fills such a large fraction of the ccd area .",
    "the sky - subtraction is not perfect , but we have endeavored to make as reliable a fit as possible .",
    "all of the results presented in this work require an effective yet accurate method of displaying our high - quality images .",
    "we will rely very heavily on unsharp masked displays of our data to show the multitude of structures present at high-@xmath3  in ngc  891 .",
    "our approach to producing quality unsharp masked displays is discussed in some detail in paper  ii , but we present here the principal points of that discussion .    figure [ fig : vfull ] shows our final v - band data for ngc  891 , as well as the unsharp masked version of the data . the v - band image ( top ) is displayed to show the distribution of stellar light along the length of the galaxy . with this display the light from the bulge is saturated , making it difficult to identify high-@xmath3  dust structures .",
    "however , the unsharp mask of the v - band data ( bottom ) allows us to show the absorbing structures along the entire length of the galaxy in one display .",
    "this masked version of the image shows the complexity of the absorbing structures that thread through the bulge area .",
    "we derive the unsharp masked versions of our images by dividing the original image by a version smoothed with a gaussian kernel having a fwhm of 35 pixels ( @xmath41 ) . with this approach",
    "we remove the large - scale gradients in the background light of the galaxy , allowing us to display all parts of the galaxy in a uniform manner .",
    "the procedure tends to accentuate structures on scales smaller than smoothing kernel ( @xmath42 pc at the distance of ngc  891 ) .",
    "this can be both an advantage and a disadvantage .",
    "most of the structures we find have minor axis scales similar or smaller than this , though not all .",
    "in some sense this offsets the natural tendency to have one s eye drawn towards very large structures .",
    "although we tend to identify structures only in computer displays of the science images ( i.e. , not the unsharp masks ) , the reader s eye may be drawn more to the small - scale structures in our unsharp masks . as in all of our papers , the unsharp masked images are only used for display , never for quantitative measurements .",
    "bright stars near ngc  891 can produce large artifacts in unsharp masked images , destroying information over a disproportionately large area .",
    "we have produced our unsharp masks by dividing the original data by a smoothed image with such problem stars replaced by a two dimensional fit to the surrounding background light before the smoothing process .",
    "the replaced area is usually chosen to be a circular aperture of several times the fwhm of the seeing disk . for fainter examples , the aperture radius was typically twice the size of the seeing disk , while the brighter stars often required apertures in excess of five times the fwhm of the seeing disk .",
    "we have also removed the effects of ccd blooming near a few bright stars .    by dividing the original image by the smoothed image with bright stars removed , we are able to keep such stars from influencing large regions of the galaxy , while at the same time showing where these stars lay with respect to the target .",
    "artifacts can be present in our unsharp masked images very near the positions of the brightest stars .",
    "faint halos ( white in this display ) can be seen around a few of the background galaxies and faint stars in figure [ fig : vfull ] .",
    "while there are potential problems associated with the interpretation of the unsharp masks displayed here , this approach is much more effective at showing the reader the true extent and complexity of the dust features we see at high-@xmath3  in ngc  891 .",
    "we are confident that , with the exception of some structures visible very near the brightest stars , the dust features seen in our unsharp masked images are real and not artifacts of the masking procedure",
    ".      we will present narrowband images of ngc  891 to study the distribution of ionized gas in this galaxy . to derive an image of the emission lines ( h@xmath0 + [ ] ) from this galaxy",
    ", we have taken images through a narrowband filter centered on the h@xmath0  emission line , and filters that cover continuum regions on each side of the h@xmath0wavelength region .",
    "the characteristics of the on- and off - band filters used are given in table [ table : narrowfilters ] .",
    "the filter off 1 is from the kitt peak filter set ( kp 809 ) , while the h@xmath0on - band filter and the filter designated off 2 are from the wiyn filter library ( w015 and w016 , respectively ) .    the h@xmath0  on - band filter contains emission from the h@xmath0  and nearby [ ]  and the nearby forbidden [ n@xmath43ii ] lines .",
    "for brevity s sake we will hereafter refer to our image as an h@xmath0image , though the reader should be aware that the bandpass also contains the [ n@xmath43ii ] transitions .",
    "] lines plus a stellar continuum contribution .",
    "to produce a pure emission line image we must subract off the contribution of the stellar continuum .",
    "our two off - band filters cover wavelength ranges shortward and longward of the h@xmath0emission line . to derive an appropriate continuum image we have coadded the off - band data with an appropriate weighting factor .",
    "each of our off - band images was normalized to one second exposure time and combined with a weighting factor , w , defined as @xmath44^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the average transmission of the filter , @xmath46 is the transmission - weighted average wavelength of the filter , and @xmath47 is the rest - wavelength of the h@xmath0  emission line .",
    "the ratio of the weighting factors for the two off - band filters is @xmath48 .    after combining the two off - band filters to produce a single continuum image , we have performed aperture photometry of a grid of @xmath49 stars in the sky - subtracted on- and off - band images .",
    "the fluxes derived from these stars were used to determine the relative scaling between the on - band and continuum images .",
    "the continuum image was multiplied by this scale factor and subtracted from the on - band image to produce the final emission line image .",
    "the use of this scale factor assures that the foreground stars in our image ( which should be pure continuum sources ) are completely subtracted .",
    "stars which are saturated , however , do not subtract completely .",
    "we reiterate that the size of the galaxy relative to the wiyn imager is large , and our sky subtraction is not perfect . in particular the 5 kpc layer detected by rand ( 1997 , 1998 ) can not be reliably characterized in our images given its extent relative to the size of the ccd .",
    "we do detect emission to @xmath50 kpc in our h@xmath0  image , but the true amount and distribution of such high-@xmath3  gas is confused by the background subtraction uncertainties .",

    "we have roughly outlined each of the identified structures to help the reader identify the regions used in our calculations . in a few cases we mark with dashed lines regions of absorption that may be associated with the identified structure but are not used in our measurements of the structure .    in paper",
    "i  we characterized dust structures at high @xmath3  in ngc  891 by their `` apparent extinction , '' @xmath57 .",
    "we defined the apparent extinction in a waveband @xmath58 as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the surface brightness measured towards a dust cloud , and @xmath61 is the surface brightness of the local background ( see paper  i ) .",

    "the systematic errors in the @xmath63 and @xmath64 determinations could be larger . in the b and v images",
    "there is significant overlap between the individual dust structures .",

    "measurements for clouds much below @xmath67 kpc can be difficult to make , and the errors on the shorter wavelength apparent extinctions can be great . at larger @xmath3 ,",
    "where the dust features become less common and typically show lower @xmath57 values , the systematic uncertainties are likely less important than the measurement error and spatial variations within an individual cloud .",

    "our new broadband images reveal a wealth of absorbing structures stretching to very large distances from the midplane of ngc  891 .",
    "figure [ fig : vfull ] shows our v - band image of ngc  891 and the unsharp masked view of these data . though we only show the v - band images here , the structure of the dust in the other two wavebands is much the same as that seen in the v - band .",
    "the absorbing structures are more prominent in the b - band and less so in the i - band .",
    "the v - band images represent a good compromise between the larger opacity at shorter wavelengths and the generally higher signal to noise in the longer wavelength observations .    the primary difference between the current dataset and that presented in paper  i  is the depth of the observations .",
    "the new broadband data are a factor of @xmath68 , on average , deeper than the data presented in paper  i , though the resolution of the current dataset is slightly worse .",
    "this allows us to identify structures against the background stellar light to larger heights from the midplane .",
    "we find firm evidence for structures at @xmath69 kpc along most of the length of the galaxy .",
    "for example , figure [ fig : filament1 ] shows a close - up view of the structure identified as @xmath70 in figure [ fig : idsw ] , which will be discussed in more detail below .",

    "though the background stellar light is rapidly dimming with height , it is clear there are no structures at heights in excess of 2.0 kpc like those seen at heights @xmath77 kpc .",
    "our images show the clear signature of the stellar thick disk ( see morrison et al .",
    "1997 and morrison 1999 ) in all three wavebands . to confirm the apparent thick disk light in our images",
    "was not simply an artifact of the extended wings of the telescope point spread function ( psf ) , we have fit several bright stars with a moffat function ( moffat 1969 ) to approximate the instrumental psf .",
    "we have then constructed several realistic thin disk model light distributions and convolved these with the instrumental psf .",
    "we find at most a few percent of the light observed to heights @xmath78 kpc could be the result of scattering of light from the thin disk ngc  891",

    "while a few features can be identified in the range @xmath75 kpc , the number of structures at these heights is much less than at lower heights , and the apparent extinctions are very small ( typically @xmath81 ; often unmeasurable in the other two bands ) .",
    "color maps of ngc  891 derived from our bvi images give a similar picture : we find ngc  891 gets _ bluer _ with increasing height until @xmath82 kpc or so .",
    "the effects of individual dust clouds on the vertical light distribution become significant in one - dimensional cuts through our data at heights in the range @xmath83 kpc .",
    "this is consistent with a phase change of the material , where dust at heights in excess of this value is more diffusely distributed and hence not visible in our images ( see  [ sec : discussion ] ) . although , the lack of dust structures at heights beyond @xmath84 kpc may simply be tracing the maximum extent to which the material was ejected .    we believe the paucity of structures at very high @xmath3  ( @xmath85 kpc ) is a real effect . there is not a large amount of highly - structured ( clumped ) dust visible in our images at these heights ; however , we can not rule out the existence of a more smoothly distributed component of the dust at very high @xmath3 .",
    "our images reveal only the dusty structures more opaque than their surroundings .",
    "the visible structures are likely tracing significantly denser regions than the surrounding material .",

    "i  we found the number of dust features on either side of the midplane of ngc  891 was roughly similar .",
    "this suggests the dust structures do not arise in a warp along the line of sight , which would cause an asymmetry in the distribution of absorbing structures .",
    "the present images show that though the number of structures is similar for each side of the midplane , there is an interesting difference in the morphology of the highest-@xmath3  absorbing structures from one side of the galaxy to the other .",
    "the northern side of the galaxy ( up in our images ) seems to show an extended series of structures oriented roughly parallel to the plane of the galaxy at @xmath87 kpc .",
    "the structure @xmath88 in figure [ fig : idmid ] is indicative of the dominant orientation of features at these heights .",
    "to the south of the midplane , however , the structures are oriented primarily vertically near @xmath89 kpc .",

    "it is possible that the `` flattening '' of structures on the northern side of the galaxy is caused by the ram pressure from the motion of ngc  891 through an intragroup medium .",
    "the ngc  1023 group to which ngc  891 belongs is dominated , in mass and luminosity , by three disk galaxies ( tully 1980 ) : ngc  1023 ( sb0 ) , ngc  891 ( sb / sbb ? ) , and ngc  925 ( sbc ) .",
    "the total extent of the group is @xmath92 mpc .",
    "ngc  891 is 0.78 mpc projected distance from ngc  1023 , similar to the separation between the milky way and andromeda , and 1.5 mpc from ngc  925 .",
    "the group as a whole is likely bound ( tully 1980 ; hart , davies , & johnson 1980 ) , and ngc  891 lies near its periphery .",
    "it is not unreasonable to expect that a group composed of three moderately massive disk galaxies with an associated population of dwarf galaxies ( at least 10 ; see tully 1980 ) should contain an intragroup medium .",
    "the communication of ngc  891 s movement through a hypothetical medium could propagate through the higher-@xmath3  material to form the horizontally - oriented structures on the northern side of the galaxy .",

    "the implied potential energies are also quite large given these masses and large heights above the plane .",
    "sandage ( 1961 ) also suggests that the support of an extended , dusty layer of material in ngc  891 must entail large amounts of energy .",
    "it should be pointed out that while detailed radiative transfer models are beyond the scope of this paper , some of the more sophisticated approaches to radiative transfer through a clumpy medium ( e.g. , kuchinski et al .",
    "1998 ; witt & gordon 1996 ) could perhaps help answer some of the more important questions regarding the properties of the observed high-@xmath3  dust .",
    "for example , detailed radiative transfer models might help shed light on the total mass of the dust at high-@xmath3and on the effects of high-@xmath3  dust opacity on optically - derived scale heights ( e.g. , for determining the scale height of dig emission ) .",
    "several of the absorbing structures identified in figures [ fig : idmid ] , [ fig : idne ] , and [ fig : idsw]warrant further discussion .",
    "we briefly comment here on a few of the more spectacular structures visible in our images .",
    "ngc 0891:d @xmath70 : as identified in figure [ fig : idsw ] this structure is an individual cloud at @xmath122 kpc .",

    "our h@xmath0  images , which will be discussed below , show an h@xmath10ii  region coincident with the inside of the dust ring . the irregular absorbing clump in the center of the dust ring seems to lie in front of the h@xmath10ii  region .",
    "we find no evidence for h@xmath0  emission associated with the filament itself . like many of the dusty structures seen in our images @xmath70 and the lower-@xmath3  portions of the filament are seen in absorption against the diffuse h@xmath0  emission of the ionized thick disk ( see below ) .",
    "haffner , reynolds , & tufte ( 1998 ) have found an ionized filament in the dig of the milky way that seems to stretch to @xmath127 kpc as a coherent feature ( as evidenced by its velocity structure ) .",
    "however , this filament is _ only _ seen in h@xmath0  emission , with h@xmath10i , x - ray , and ir emission being absent .",

    "perhaps this structure represents a supershell that has experienced `` blowout . ''",
    "we will address this issue in more detail below when we discuss the h@xmath0  emission line images .",
    "ngc 0891:d @xmath136 : though this structure is interesting for its height ( @xmath122 kpc ) , perhaps its most interesting attribute is that it obscures a background spiral galaxy ( see figure [ fig : idmid ] ) .",
    "the southern edge of this spiral , centered at @xmath137 , @xmath138 , is completely obscured in the b - band .",
    "while the v - band shows slightly more of the low-@xmath3  end of this galaxy , there still appears to be a significant amount of the galaxy that is simply missing .",
    "the analysis of the light from this galaxy could in principle give us a better estimate of the opacity though a high-@xmath3dust structure .",
    "unfortunately such an analysis is complicated by the slightly irregular , asymmetric structure of the galaxy .",
    "furthermore , an unresolved source is seen at the apex of the curve traced by the dust structure ( @xmath139 , @xmath140 ) , and directly over the expected emission from the background spiral , in the i - band .",
    "this source is not present in either the v- or b - band images .",
    "the archival _ hst _  image presented in paper  i , which is taken through a very broad filter that encompasses much of the v and r bandpasses , clearly shows an unresolved source as well .",
    "this object could conceivably be an intermediate age or globular cluster lying behind @xmath136 , and hence being extincted by this dust structure .",

    "it is clear from visual inspection that this background spiral is very heavily extincted in the b and v images .",
    "emission from extraplanar dig in ngc  891 was first detected by dettmar ( 1990 ) and rand et al .",
    "( 1990 ) through narrowband imaging .",
    "spectroscopic studies of the dig have more thoroughly characterized its distribution and properties ( dettmar & shultz 1992 ; keppel et al.1991 ; pildis et al .",

    "the power required to ionize the dig can only be comfortably met by the ionizing radiation from early type stars ( e.g. , rand et al .",
    "1990 ) . the strength of forbidden line emission from [ ] and [ ] relative to h@xmath0  increases with height above the plane ( dettmar & shultz 1992 ; rand 1997 , 1998 ) , as does the strength of [ ] to h@xmath146 ( rand 1998 ) .",
    "pure photoionization models for the dig ( e.g. , sembach et al .  2000 ; domgrgen & mathis 1994 ) with very dilute ionizing radiation fields can match the high [ ] and [ ] to h@xmath0  ratios , though the very highest [ ] and [ ] to h@xmath0  ratios may require heating mechanisms beyond those in low - density ionized nebulae ( reynolds , haffner , & tufte 1999 ) .",

    "( 1990 ) and dettmar ( 1990 ) , there is a strong asymmetry in the strength of the emission between the northeast and southwest sides of the disk ( left and right , respectively , in our images ) ; this asymmetry is also seen in the radio continuum observations of dahlem , dettmar , & hummel ( 1994 ) and in the far infrared ( 50 @xmath33 m ) observations of wainscoat , de jong , & wesselius ( 1987 ) .",
    "we also see an asymmetry in the light distribution in our broadband images , with the northeast section of the disk being brighter than the southwest section at most heights @xmath148 kpc .",

    "these candidate h@xmath10ii  regions and their associated continuum sources will be discussed in a future publication ( howk & savage , in preparation ) .      in this section we very briefly summarize the properties of several of the filamentary structures observed atop the more diffuse component of the dig in ngc  891 .",
    "we do this both because it allows the reader to compare the general properties and distribution of the ionized gas filaments with those traced by the dust , and because no previous catalog of such structures exists in the literature , though there seems to be a general consensus that this filamentary component is important ( rand 1997 , 1998 ; rand et al .",

    "however , it is clear from figures [ fig : hafull ] and [ fig : filaments ] that the filamentary structures in the dig do not show as great a contrast compared with the background emission as the dust structures , which are visible only because they are much more opaque than their surroundings .    not only are the h@xmath0-emitting filaments less numerous ( and less prominent ) than the dust structures seen in absorption , but much of the h@xmath0  emission seems to be in the form of a more smoothly - distributed medium . however , the appearance of this `` smooth '' component is made more complicated by the absorption caused by the dust features seen in our broadband images .",
    "we have avoided identifying any apparent structures that may be caused by absorption due to intervening dust .",
    "the distribution of dust - laden filaments is more symmetric about the center of ngc  891 than the distribution of h@xmath0  filaments .",

    "we have identified in figure [ fig : filaments ] are oriented roughly perpendicular to the plane of ngc  891 .",

    "we suggest that all of these aspects of the high-@xmath3  dust features can be understood in the context of a multiphase ism in the thick disk of ngc  891 , possibly in a quasi - stable configuration .",
    "the dusty clouds seen far above the disks of spirals likely represent a dense phase of the ism at high-@xmath3 . in this case",
    "they may be the result of thermal instabilities in the high-@xmath3  ism and may perhaps be in pressure equilibrium with either the dig or hot , x - ray emitting gas ( e.g. , wolfire et al .",

    "our images show the ionized gas is certainly more smoothly distributed than the material traced by the dust clouds .",
    "this suggests the volume filling factor of the dense phase is lower than that of the dig , in accord with theoretical expectations ( e.g. , mckee & ostriker 1977 ) .",
    "however , given the lack of association between the dig and the dense material seen in absorption , it is clear that some portion of the warm ionized medium is not associated with cool cores of neutral material , e.g. , as envisioned by mckee & ostriker ( 1977 ) .    in paper",

    "thus the minimum pressure required to support the high-@xmath3  dust clouds in ngc  891 could be slightly lower than this value .",
    "if we assume the observed structures are cylindrically symmetric , so that their depth along the line of sight is similar to their minor axis lengths , the column density estimates given in table [ table : derived ] suggest these structures have densities @xmath181 @xmath31 .",
    "this is much greater than the expected density of the dig at _ any _ distance from the plane , further suggesting that the h@xmath0  emitting structures are tracing a separate medium than that traced by the dust .",
    "this gross density estimate is consistent with the average densities predicted for dense clouds in the wolfire et al .",
    "( 1995a ) models ( see also paper  ii ) .",
    "our rough calculations in paper  ii  suggested the average pressures in the dig or hot ionized medium traced by x - rays were sufficient to support a dense phase of the ism .",
    "for example , the average pressure provided by the dig is @xmath180 k @xmath31  at @xmath182 kpc ( assuming the electron distribution of rand 1997 and @xmath183 k ) .",
    "the x - ray emitting gas likely has a larger pressure ( bregman & houck 1997 ) . the paucity of clouds beyond @xmath184 kpc is understandable in this scenario : at heights in excess of @xmath185 kpc , the pressure of the ambient medium may be too low to support a dense phase of the ism . in this case dust may still exist at larger heights above the midplane , but our images are not sensitive to a diffuse component of dust .",
    "we are only able to see those regions that are denser ( i.e. , more opaque ) than their surroundings . given the uncertainties in the distribution , temperature , filling factor , and ionization fraction of the ambient gas , we believe the pressure requirements for confinement of a dense medium are easily met in ngc  891 at heights @xmath186 kpc .",
    "other theoretical and observational lines of evidence support our conclusion that the dust structures trace a dense medium at high-@xmath3 .",
    "the three - dimensional numerical simulations of gaseous disk dynamics by de avillez ( 1999 ) suggest that the formation of dense interstellar clouds at great @xmath3-heights may be a relatively common by - product of the circulation of material between the disk and halo of a galaxy .",
    "his simulations follow the temperature , density , and dynamics of parcels of gas in a model galactic disk undergoing star formation , and hence experiencing energy input by supernovae .",
    "the combined effects of multiple supernovae produce a fountain - like flow in these models , with gas continually flowing up from the disk and raining down upon it from above .",
    "these detailed simulations show cloud formation at high-@xmath3 . in these simulations",
    "the bulk of the clouds are formed between @xmath187 kpc , and de avillez suggests the formation of dense clouds is much more efficient in regions compressed by shock waves . in particular",
    "he finds the intersections of shocks at high-@xmath3  can serve to compress the gas , which then cools rapidly .",

    "several of the high-@xmath3  dust features in our images , which have properties similar to those identified in ngc  891 ( howk & savage 1999c ; paper  ii ) correspond to high-@xmath3  co emission in the maps of garca - burillo  et al .",
    "the direct observation of molecular emission associated with the extraplanar dust structures in ngc  4013 supports our suggestion in paper  ii  that the high-@xmath3  absorbing dust structures observed in several edge - on galaxies represent a dense , possibly molecular phase of the thick disk ism .",
    "garca - burillo  et al .  (",
    "1992 ) and sofue & nakai ( 1993 ) have also given evidence for a co - emitting component of the thick disk of ngc  891 , though at much lower resolution .",
    "several candidate h@xmath10ii  regions can be identified in our h@xmath0  images of ngc  891 at heights @xmath189 to 2.0 kpc from the midplane ( howk & savage 1999c ; howk & savage , in preparation ) .",
    "associated with these candidate h@xmath10ii  regions we find faint continuum sources ( @xmath190 to 23 mag ) .",
    "if spectroscopically confirmed , the presence of h@xmath10iiregions at such high-@xmath3  suggests the underlying stars were formed in the thick interstellar disk of ngc  891 .",
    "this would require the existence of molecular clouds far from the midplane , and hence lend implicit support to our conclusion that a dense phase of the ism is present at high-@xmath3 , visible as the absorbing dust structures seen in our images .",
    "these nebulae will also be a useful probe of the physical conditions of the thick disk ism in ngc  891 .",
    "for example , our wiyn images constrain the radii of these nebulae to be @xmath191 pc .",
    "if ionized by b0 or earlier stars , this implies an ambient electron density of at least @xmath192 @xmath31  ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "thus the density of at least one phase of the interstellar thick disk of ngc  891 is quite dense , even at rather large heights above the plane ( @xmath184 kpc ) .",
    "density estimates for the dig at these heights are factors of @xmath193 smaller than the lower density limit implied the h@xmath10ii  regions , further suggesting large variations in the density of the interstellar thick disk .",
    "we note that the dust filaments seen in our images likely can not be caused by a gaseous warp in this galaxy , and they are unlikely to be associated with a flare in the outer galaxy .",
    "ngc  891 shows no evidence for a warp in its h@xmath10i  distribution ( swaters et al .",
    "1997 ; sancisi & allen 1979 ) , and the relative numbers of the dust features on either side of the midplane are very similar ( paper  i ) , suggesting these features can not come from a warp along the line of sight .",
    "while a flared gaseous layer can not be ruled out , it seems unlikely the observed dust features are associated with a flare . at least _ some _ of the features are clearly associated with regions of vigorous star formation in the disk .",
    "the detection of co from similar extraplanar dust structures in ngc  4013 by garca - burillo  et al.(1999 ) gives some information on the velocities of these structures .",
    "in particular , one such dust feature lies immediately above the dynamical center of the galaxy , but is moving at @xmath194 km s@xmath195  relative to the systemic velocity of the galaxy .",
    "this velocity is clearly incompatable with the location of the structure in a smoothly rotating flared gas layer .",
    "several other features can be identified with velocities inconsistent with their presence in a galactic flare .",
    "we do not believe a flared or warped gas layer is causing the dust structures we see in our images .",
    "we believe a self - consistent picture of the high-@xmath3  ism in ngc  891 can be drawn in which the thick disk ism is made up of a multiphase medium , including a cold , dense phase , a warm ( neutral and ionized ) phase , and a hot phase .",
    "the estimated masses of the warm neutral , warm ionized , and cold , dense phases of the ism above @xmath196 pc are all of order a few@xmath8 m@xmath6 .",
    "the high-@xmath3  phases of the ism together represent @xmath197 of the total mass of the ism in ngc  891 ( swaters et al .",

    "the mass of the hot ism at high-@xmath3  is estimated to be @xmath198 m@xmath6  ( bregman & houck 1997 ) .",
    "the presence of the dense phase , in particular , requires a relatively large pressure to large heights above the midplane . the available data on the hot and warm ionized media are consistent with the required pressures in the thick disk of ngc  891 .",
    "such high pressure in this transition region between the thin disk and the more extended halo of the galaxy is required to support the weight of the higher-@xmath3  gas . however , the origin of this high-@xmath3  gas , and hence the origin of the high pressure confining the dense clouds , is likely ultimately tied to star formation in the disk of the galaxy . and",
    "though the existence of interstellar material in the thick disks and halos of galaxies was once thought to be a relatively rare phenomenon , our previous work ( paper  ii ) implies the transfer of matter from the thin interstellar disks to the more extended halos may be a common property of spiral galaxies .",
    "furthermore , our images imply that this transfer does not destroy the dust grains .",
    "this is important since it can therefore be argued that the more extended halos of galaxies may not be completely devoid of dust ( see , e.g. , zaritsky 1994 ) .",
    "we have presented deep , high - resolution ground based images of the edge - on spiral ngc  891 obtained with the wiyn 3.5-m telescope .",
