    "this process can be strongly fostered by the implementation of integrated optical devices offering miniaturized and potentially low - cost components for applications in quantum key distribution @xcite , long distance quantum communication @xcite , quantum repeaters @xcite , and quantum networks @xcite .",
    "moreover , compact and rugged integrated optical quantum circuits @xcite with high functionality can efficiently replace bulky implementations to pave the way to practical applications .    in particular , quantum repeater architectures",
    "have been proposed @xcite to overcome current limitations of long distance quantum communication due to transmission losses .",
    "these typically require spectrally narrowband two - color photon pairs for instance to address the absorption line of the storage medium in a quantum memory ( qm ) @xcite with one photon and transmit the second over a fiber network .",
    "such qms usually have their absorption in the visible or near infrared , i.e.  far away from the telecommunication range .",
    "the corresponding bandwidths are typically in the range of mhz to ghz , depending on different storage regimes ( like spin - wave storage in cold atomic ensembles , atomic - frequency - comb echoes in solid state and room - temperature storage ) . among the most promising materials for high - bandwidth qm s",
    "are solid - state atomic ensembles , specifically rare - earth ion doped crystals or glasses @xcite and qm at room - temperature @xcite .",
    "a wide - spread method to generate photon pairs is parametric down conversion ( pdc ) @xcite .",
    "in such a pdc process , a medium with @xmath2 nonlinearity splits a single pump photon into two photons of lower energy , named signal and idler , obeying energy conservation and phase matching .",
    "however , the loose phase - matching condition for both , bulk and waveguide sources , usually leads to a continuous broad bandwidth typically exceeding several 100 ghz and a mixed state in frequency . to overcome this bottle - neck , narrowband photon - pair sources",
    "are desired with an adapted bandwidth and a high spectral brightness .    one promising approach to generate such narrowband photon pairs is to use resonance enhancement of pdc within a cavity , also called optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) far below the threshold @xcite .",
    "pdc is enhanced at the resonances of the cavity but inhibited at non - resonant frequencies .",

    "non - degenerate photon pairs with linewidths of about 2 mhz oscillating on 4 longitudinal modes  which was obtained in the bulk cavity @xcite , most of the bulk sources suffer from low pair production efficiency , degenerate frequency , bad mode selectivity and complicated cavity locking techniques .    to overcome these limitations strong benefits from a monolithic implementation of this scheme can be expected .",
    "recently , a high q cavity using a whispering gallery mode resonator has been demonstrated to achieve single - mode photon pairs @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach using a periodically poled lithium niobate ( ppln ) waveguide with dielectric mirrors deposited on its end - faces has been demonstrated to generate nearly degenerate photon - pairs via a type i phase - matched pdc process in the telecom region@xcite .",
    "however , it exhibited a limited mode selectivity , because the spectrum consisted of a series of longitudinal modes due to the small difference of the free spectral ranges ( fsrs ) of signal and idler close to degeneracy .",
    "a detailed theoretical study @xcite indicates that exploiting type ii phase - matching should strongly limit the number of longitudinal modes because the large birefringence provides a larger difference of the fsrs , thus , fosters the spectral narrowing .",
    "[ tb : refresult01 ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the drawback of the resonant sources reported so far is that they either achieve narrow bandwidth , or operate single mode , or reach high brightness , or combine two wavelengths for atomic transition and fiber communications .",

    "as maximum efficiency is only obtained if both signal and idler are resonant simultaneously , pdc is generated only in certain regions of the spectrum , so called clusters @xcite . in this way the spectral density is redistributed in comparison to the non - resonant case and , thus , ideally a completely filter - free source with actively reduced bandwidth can be realized without sacrificing any photon flux level . in sec.[fabrication ] and sec.[setup ] details on the waveguide fabrication and the experimental set - up are given , respectively .",
    "the practical implementation is challenging because it requires loss minimization , short poling periods for phase - matching and specifically tailored mirror coatings for both signal and idler photons . in sec.[results ]",

    "these resonances form frequency combs spaced with respective fsrs in the signal and idler wavelength range ( as shown in the supplementary movie ) .",
    "@xmath42 the fsr is the inverse of the round - trip time of a photon in the cavity .    the fwhm of each resonance , @xmath43 , is related with the finesse @xmath44 of the cavity : @xmath45 for the type i degenerate case , the frequency combs of signal and idler photons are identical .",
    "thus , pdc generation still happens at all comb frequencies within the phase - matching bandwidth .",
    "however , for type ii and/or degenerate case , there are different fsrs in the resonant waveguide due to the different group dispersions at the signal and idler wavelengths , as shown in the upper two curves in fig .",

    "the couple of simultaneous resonances for signal and idler is called a cluster @xcite . however , after a certain number of free spectral ranges , another cluster occurs again , if the phase - matching bandwidth is broad enough .",

    "( [ eq : enhancementm1 ] ) tells us that the higher the finesse of cavity is , the more enhancement can be achieved @xcite .",
    "the enhancement factor is roughly proportional to the square of the finesse of the cavity .    however , for a waveguide based resonant pdc source the internal losses must be considered .",

    "hence , @xmath57 decreases with increasing the finesse by higher mirror reflectivities keeping waveguide length and losses constant .",
    "on the other hand , the spectral redistribution due to the clustering results in a @xmath50 times increased spectral density at the synchronous signal and idler resonance .      to verify the photon pairs generation and to evaluate its efficiency",
