    "* optimization principle for single contact . * motivated mainly by recent experiments with elastic substrates @xcite , we suggest that an adherent cell positions and orients itself in such a way that it senses maximal effective stiffness in its environment . in these experiments ,",
    "the most relevant input for cellular decision making is local elasticity of the surrounding environment .",
    "thus we first have to calculate how stress and strain in the medium is propagated towards the cell .",
    "these calculations are in general very complicated and will be presented below for different situations of interest . in order to keep our calculations feasible , we assume that the extracellular environment is described by isotropic linear elasticity theory .",
    "this holds true for most synthetic elastic substrates and might be a reasonable assumption for hydrogels .",
    "hence , there are two elastic moduli , the young modulus @xmath0 ( which describes rigidity ) and the poisson ratio @xmath1 ( which describes the relative weight of compression and shear modes ) . in practice",
    ", @xmath0 will be on the order of kpa , which is a typical physiological value for tissue stiffness . in most situations ,",
    "@xmath1 is expected to be close to @xmath2 ( the value for an incompressible medium ) , but other values might be realized in future applications .",
    "we then ask in which way the cell will organize itself if it probes its local environment by actively pulling on it . in particular , we aim to define a quantity which describes the kind of information which the cell can extract from its soft environment with the help of its contractile machinery .",
    "we first consider a single cell - matrix contact and suggest that an appropriate choice is the work @xmath3 which the cell has to invest into the surrounding elastic medium in order to build up some force @xmath4 at the contact position @xmath5 . as we will show now , the quantity @xmath3 can be used to describe the effects of increased rigidity @xmath0 and prestrain in the elastic environment on an equal basis .",
    "therefore @xmath3 is a measure for the effective stiffness of the elastic environment as probed through a single contact .    in the absence of prestrain ,",
    "the work @xmath3 invested into the environment is @xmath6 where summation over repeated indices is implied . here",
    "@xmath7 is the displacement caused by the cell , @xmath8 the corresponding strain tensor and @xmath9 the elastic constant tensor based on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the volume integral runs over the whole space filled with extracellular material and its conversion into a local expression requires partial integration and use of the mechanical equilibrium conditions ( details of our calculations will be published elsewhere ) .",
    "formally , the self - energy of a given contact diverges for a point force , but this divergence can easily be removed by assuming distributed force . since displacement decreases with increasing rigidity ( @xmath10 ) , the cell has to invest less work @xmath11 in order to achieve a certain force @xmath4 when rigidity @xmath0 increases .",
    "hence , the cell senses maximal stiffness at the contact when @xmath11 is minimal .    in a homogeneous medium ,",
    "the elastic constants do not change and @xmath11 is a constant .",
    "however , the work @xmath3 needed to build up some force @xmath4 at the contact position @xmath5 can vary due to the presence of prestrain .",
    "the corresponding contribution to @xmath3 is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the displacement caused by the external strain and @xmath14 the corresponding strain tensor . since a negative @xmath15 reduces the cellular work @xmath16 , as does a larger rigidity @xmath0 , it represents an effective stiffening of the environment ( _ strain - stiffening _ ) .",
    "correspondingly , a positive @xmath15 represents an effective softening with respect to the unstrained medium . therefore the quantity @xmath3 allows to characterize the local elastic input available to an actively mechanosensing cell within the unifying concept of effective stiffness , independent of its physical origin , which might be rigidity or prestrain . in the following",
    ", we will identify optimal cell position and orientation with the specific force pattern which minimizes the quantity @xmath3 . in the sense described here ,",
    "this corresponds to a cellular preference for maximal effective stiffness in its local elastic environment .",
    "it is important to note that conceptually the principle suggested here does not imply that the cell actually minimizes the work @xmath3 invested into its soft environment .",
    "instead we suggest here that calculating the quantity @xmath3 for different situations of interest is an appropriate measure for the kind of information a cell can extract from its elastic environment through active mechanosensing .",
    "the real justification of our model will be its success in explaining a large body of experimental data ( see results section ) .",
    "nevertheless , below we will also present some potential mechanism for the cellular preference for effective stiffness , which in fact uses the quantity @xmath3 not as a characterization of the external environment , but as a relevant quantity for some internal mechanism .",
    "* optimization principle for cellular force pattern . *",
    "different contacts are coupled through the actin cytoskeleton in such a way that overall force balance is ensured .",
    "we account for this constraint by considering only pairs of opposing forces . in elasticity",
    "theory , such a pinching force pattern is known as an _ anisotropic force contraction dipole _ , that is the tensor @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the dipole strength , the product of force magnitude and force separation , and @xmath19 its orientation @xcite .",
    "typical cellular dipoles have been measured to be of the order of @xmath20 ( this corresponds to two forces of 200 nn each , separated by a distance of 60 @xmath21 m ) @xcite .",
    "the effect of external strain on the work required to build up the force dipole @xmath22 at the cell position @xmath23 can be written as @xmath24 like in the case of a single contact , optimal cell organization can be identified with the specific force pattern which minimizes @xmath25 .",
    "it follows directly from that due to the contractile activity of the cell ( @xmath26 ) , tensile strain ( @xmath27 ) will always be favorable ( negative @xmath15 ) .",
    "in contrast to compressive strain ( @xmath28 ) , it corresponds to an effective increase in stiffness .",
    "note that in contrast to position , orientation and sign , the magnitude @xmath29 of the cellular force pattern does not matter in the model presented here .",
    "this reflects the fact that here we aim to characterize the mechanical properties of the extracellular environment sensed by the cell , rather than the process of active mechanosensing itself .",
    "an adherent cell actively pulls on its soft environment through cell - matrix contacts .",
    "experimentally , one finds that cells orient themselves in the direction of maximal stiffness of the environment . with this cartoon",
    ", we present one possible mechanism by which active mechanosensing in an elastically anisotropic medium might lead to cell orientation .",
    "the local elastic environment is represented by linear springs with different spring constants @xmath30 , as indicated by differently sized springs .",
    "for upregulation of a contact , the cell has to invest the work @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , upregulation is more efficient for larger @xmath30 .",
    "( a ) in an isotropic environment , all spring constants are the same , growth at different contacts is similar and the cell does not orient .",
    "( b ) if spring constants are largest in one specific direction , the corresponding contacts outgrow the others and the cell orients in the direction of maximal stiffness of the environment .",
    "in this paper , we use the cellular preference for large effective stiffness and modelling of the extracellular environment by linear elasticity theory to predict cell positioning and orientation in soft media . ]    * possible origin of optimization principle . *",
    "our modelling starts from the phenomenological observation that cells seem to prefer maximal effective stiffness in their environment .",
    "although it can be justified by its large success in explaining experimental observations ( see results section ) , we also want to suggest a possible mechanism for our main assumption . for this purpose",
    ", we use a simple one - dimensional analogue . consider the extracellular environment to act like a linear spring with spring constant @xmath30 , on which the cell is pulling through a single cell - matrix contact .",
    "recent experiments on focal adhesions @xcite suggest that upregulation of contact growth is related to reaching a certain threshold in force @xmath32 , although the details of how force affects regulation are just beginning to emerge @xcite . in order to build up sufficiently large force @xmath32",
    ", the cell has to invest energy @xmath33 into the spring .",
    "thus , the stiffer the spring ( the larger @xmath30 ) , the less work is needed and the more efficient the build - up of force will be .",
    "an equivalent viewpoint is to assume that the cell invests the power @xmath34 into stretching the spring .",
    "then it takes the time @xmath35 to reach the force @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , a specific contact will grow faster than the other contacts if it encounters a larger stiffness @xmath30 . in principle , the cellular program could also be geared towards achieving a certain displacement of the surrounding material , which would result in a preference for effective softness of the environment .",
    "however , this scenario would imply the existence of some additional mechanism for outside - in signaling .",
    "it is more realistic to consider that force activates the cellular response through a certain displacement of elastic components located _ inside _ the cell . since internal displacement and force",
    "are expected to be linearly related through another ( internal ) spring constant , one arrives at the same result .",
    "adhering cells probe the mechanical properties of their environment by pulling at many cell - matrix contacts simultaneously ( ) . at each newly formed contact the cell is expected to pull with a similar investment of resources ( e.g.  actin , myosin or atp ) .",
    "however , each contact encounters a different elastic environment , each of which can be represented by a different spring constant . in an isotropic situation ( a )",
    ", all spring constants are equal , the contacts have similar growth behavior and there is no reason for a cell to orient .",
    "experimentally , the cell adopts a round or stellate morphology , depending on the number of cell - matrix contacts . in an anisotropic situation ( b ) , build - up of force is more efficient in one specific direction and contacts in this direction will eventually outgrow the other ones . here",
    ", the anisotropic elastic properties of the medium provide an orientational clue for the cell , which orients along the direction of maximal effective stiffness . depending on e.g.the presence of motility factors ,",
    "this orientation response might be followed by cell locomotion .",
    "* homogeneous external strain*. we first consider a cell interacting with homogeneous external strain , either on the top surface of a rectangular slab of elastic material ( elastic substrate ) or inside an infinite elastic material ( hydrogel ) . in both cases ,",
    "the equations of three - dimensional isotropic elasticity give @xmath36 \\label{eq : strain}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the orientation angle relative to the direction of the externally applied tensile stress @xmath38 .",
    "optimal cell orientation corresponds to minimal @xmath15 , which is achieved for @xmath39 , irrespective of the poisson ratio @xmath1 .",
    "thus the cell orients preferentially with the direction of stretch .",
    "this behavior is indeed observed experimentally , both for fibroblast on elastic substrates @xcite and in collagen gels @xcite . since @xmath15 decreases with increasing rigidity @xmath0 ,",
    "the elastic effects discussed here will be observed only in a soft environment , namely with rigidity @xmath0 around kpa , which is a typical physiological value for tissue stiffness . for stiffer substrates the variations in @xmath15 for different contact positions might become too small to induce an orientation response .",
    "adjusting cell position and orientation in such a way that the cell senses maximal effective stiffness in its environment is equivalent to minimizing the quantity @xmath3 , the amount of work the cell invests into the elastic surroundings in the presence of external strain . in the presence of mechanical activity ,",
    "sample boundaries induce external strain which can result in different cell organization .",
    "( a ) @xmath15 for a cell with dipole strength @xmath18 which is a distance @xmath40 away from the surface of an elastic halfspace with rigidity @xmath0 , plotted in units of @xmath41 as a function of angle @xmath37 between cell orientation and surface normal ( rescaled by @xmath42 )",
    ". solid and dashed lines correspond to poisson ratios @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "irrespective of @xmath1 , the optimal orientations ( minimal @xmath15 ) are perpendicular ( @xmath45 ) and parallel ( @xmath46 ) to the surface for clamped and free boundaries , respectively . since @xmath47 increases if @xmath40 decreases , the overall mechanical activity of a cell increases towards a clamped surface ( @xmath48 ) , but decreases towards a free surface ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "( b ) @xmath15 for a cell in an elastic sphere of radius @xmath50 , plotted in units of @xmath51 as a function of distance @xmath52 to the sphere center in units of @xmath50 for @xmath53 ( rescaled by @xmath54 ) .",
    "solid and dashed lines are parallel ( @xmath55 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath39 ) orientations , respectively ( all other orientations yields curves which lie inbetween the ones shown ) . like in an elastic halfspace , parallel and perpendicular orientations are favored ( minimal @xmath15 ) for free and clamped boundaries , respectively . for clamped boundaries ,",
    "mechanical activity is favored ( smaller @xmath15 ) towards the surface . for free boundaries ,",
    "mechanical activity is disfavored ( larger @xmath15 ) towards the surface . ]    predicted cell orientation in a hydrogel close to a surface ( a , b ) and on elastic substrates ( c , d ) .",
    "( a ) cells prefer the direction of maximal effective stiffness .",
    "thus , they orient perpendicular to a clamped surface . ( b ) for a free surface , this direction is parallel to the surface .",
    "( c ) cells close to a boundary between soft ( left ) and rigid ( right ) regions prefer analogous orientations as cells close to clamped and free surfaces in a hydrogel , respectively .",
    "( d ) cells interact elastically to form strings , because in nose - to - tail alignment , the mechanical activity of one cell triggers the one of the other cell , thereby forming a positive feedback loop . ]    * boundaries*. in a physiological context , cells are often close to boundaries , like the surface of a tissue or organ . in the presence of cell traction , boundaries alter the strain with respect to a homogeneous infinite medium by a boundary - induced strain ( _ image strain _ ) , which has a similar effect like external strain . in this way , cells can actively sense not only the presence of a close - by surface , but also its shape and boundary conditions . in order to predict the effect of boundaries on cell organization , we study a semi - infinite space with a planar surface , for which the elastic equations can be solved exactly @xcite .",
    "the details of the boundary conditions in a physiological context can be very complicated .",
    "here we address two fundamental reference cases , namely free and clamped boundary conditions , for which normal stress and displacement , respectively , vanish at the surface .",
    "consider a force dipole which is a distance @xmath40 away from the planar surface and has an angle of orientation @xmath37 relative to the surface normal .",
    "we find @xmath56 where the coefficients @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are complicated functions of @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath15 scales quadratically with @xmath18 because the image strain scales linearly with @xmath18 ( in other words , the force dipole interacts with its images ) . for free and clamped surfaces ,",
    "the coefficients are positive and negative , respectively , irrespective of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the optimal configurations ( minimal @xmath15 ) are parallel ( @xmath46 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath60 ) for free and clamped boundaries , respectively , as plotted in a. a schematic representation ( a and b ) provides a simple interpretation : for clamped ( free ) boundary conditions , the cell senses maximal stiffness perpendicular ( parallel ) to the surface .",
    "one may think of a clamped ( free ) surface as the interface between the medium and a imaginary medium of infinite ( vanishing ) rigidity , which effectively rigidifies ( softens ) the medium towards the boundary .",
    "in general , we find that free and clamped boundary conditions always have opposite effects , albeit with one essential difference : for clamped boundaries , mechanical activity of cells is favored and cells can amplify this effect by adjusting orientation . for free boundaries , mechanical activity of cells is disfavored and the orientation response is an aversion response .",
    "experimentally , it is well known that mechanical activity of cells increases for clamped boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the predicted orientation effects close to boundaries have been observed numerous times , e.g.  the parallel orientation of cells close to free surfaces @xcite .",
    "our model predicts the same orientation effects for an elastic substrate with two regions of different rigidities ( c ) : cells on the soft and stiff sides of the boundary orient perpendicular and parallel to it , respectively .",
    "indeed fibroblasts migrating from a soft to a stiff region keep their perpendicular orientation and cross over to the stiff side , while fibroblasts migrating from a stiff to a soft region do not cross the boundary , but turn by 90 degrees and move parallel to the boundary @xcite",
    ".    * finite sized sample .",
    "* as an example for a finite sized sample , we consider the elastic sphere with radius @xmath50 .",
    "the elastic equations can be solved exactly by using an expansion in terms of vector spherical harmonics @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath61 where @xmath52 denotes distance to the sphere center , @xmath37 the orientation in respect to the radial direction and @xmath62 is an infinite sum over all angular momenta , which does not change qualitatively as @xmath1 is varied . in regard to orientation",
    ", we find the same results as for the elastic halfspace ( compare b ) : cells will orient parallel ( perpendicular ) to free ( clamped ) surfaces , respectively .",
    "we also find a similar result for the effect of distance to the surface : for free ( clamped ) boundary conditions , a small ( large ) distance to the sphere center is more favorable , since the surface favors ( disfavors ) mechanical activity .",
    "the new aspect here is the role of sphere radius @xmath50 : since @xmath47 increases when sphere radius @xmath50 decreases , one can effectively rigidify ( soften ) a material with clamped ( free ) boundaries by reducing system size .",
    "our predictions could be tested using e.g.  fibroblast - populated collagen microspheres , an assay which has been introduced to study compaction of tissue equivalents at high cell density @xcite .",
    "since here we are mainly concerned with single cell effects , we suggest to modify this assay in such a way as to monitor the organization of isolated cells close to the sphere surface at low cell density and as a function of varying sphere radius .",
    "monte carlo simulations of elastically interacting cells in an external strain field .",
    "the temperature used in the simulation represents the stochastic element of the process of cell organization . without external strain ,",
    "cells form strings . in its presence , strings align in parallel . ]    * cooperative effects . * up to now",
    "we have been discussing single cell effects and we now turn to cooperative effects . in particular , we now consider the case that external strain is caused by the traction of other cells , which amounts to an elastic interaction of cells . even if all cells initially have isotropic force patterns , they will sense anisotropic strain fields and start to orient themselves .",
    "for the simplest case of two cells , we find @xmath63 where @xmath52 is the distance between the force dipoles and @xmath64 is a complicated function of @xmath1 and the three orientational degrees of freedom .",
    "our calculation shows that @xmath15 has a pronounced minimum for completely aligned dipoles , independent of @xmath1 ( d ) . in this configuration ,",
    "both cells sense maximal effective stiffness , because maximal strain stiffening occurs along the axis of contraction .",
    "this finding suggests that a common pattern for the organization of elastically interacting cells will be the formation of strings of cells .",
    "they might close into rings , so that each cell can be fully activated by its two neighbors .",
    "we used monte carlo simulations to obtain a typical configuration of elastically interacting cells in an external strain field ( ) . the temperature of the monte carlo simulation represents the stochastic nature of the orientation response .",
    "we find strings of cells aligned in parallel with the external strain , exactly as observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that there is a positive feedback for cell alignment : the more cells orient in one direction , the stronger becomes the input for other cells to adopt the same orientation .",
    "for example , it has been reported that when boundary condition are changed from clamped to free by cutting the collagen gel , fibroblasts show the predicted reorientation by 90 degrees only when sufficiently many cells are present @xcite .",
    "in fact our calculations and simulations show that cells can orient in parallel even with respect to clamped boundaries , if there are sufficiently many cells such that the direct elastic interaction between cells dominates the single cell response of perpendicular orientation . in practise",
    ", the single cell response might also be disturbed because elastic signals could be screened by traction of randomly oriented cells .",
    "indeed such an effect has been reported for experiments with elastic substrates @xcite .",
    "it has long been known , especially in the medical and bioengineering communities , that cell organization in soft media is strongly influenced by the mechanical properties of the environment .",
    "here we presented a model which is able to explain numerous experimental observations that have been reported for organization of cells ( especially fibroblasts ) both on elastic substrates and in hydrogels .",
    "the excellent agreement of our results with experiments suggests that cell organization can be predicted from local mechanical properties which the cell actively senses in its environment .",
    "in fact the only property of cellular regulation which enters our model is the assumption that cells locally prefer large effective stiffness .",
    "otherwise our modelling focuses on the elastic properties of the extracellular environment .",
    "modelling the soft environment of cells as an isotropic elastic medium is certainly a good assumption for elastic substrates .",
    "the situation is more complicated for hydrogels , in particular because they might not behave elastically and because they feature fiber degrees of freedom .",
    "cell organization in gels is often explained by contact guidance , the alignment of cells along topographic features like collagen fibers .",
    "since fibers can become aligned due to cell traction , contact guidance provides a long - ranged and persistent mechanism for cellular self - organization in tissue equivalents @xcite .",
    "this process has been modeled before . in the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite , flux equations for cellular and matrix densities are combined with mechanical equations which include cells as centers of isotropic contraction . this might be a good model for chondrocytes , which tend to show a spherical morphology .",
    "the anisotropic biphasic theory ( abt ) from ref .",
    "@xcite aims at cells like fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells , whose typical morphology in tissue equivalents is bipolar .",
    "abt introduces a cell orientation tensor , which is coupled to a fiber orientation tensor , since cells are assumed to react foremost to fiber degrees of freedom . in our model ,",
    "the force dipole tensor represents cell orientation as does the cell orientation tensor in abt , but it is coupled to elastic degrees of freedom , since cells are assumed to react foremost to large effective stiffness .",
    "because models for contact guidance in tissue equivalents focus on fiber degrees of freedom and high cell densities , they do not explain the single cell responses observed on elastic substrates , where contact guidance usually is ruled out @xcite .",
    "the large predictive power of our model for elastic substrate experiments suggests that active mechanosensing by single cells might also be involved with cell organization in hydrogels .",
    "however , for the collagen assay from ref .  @xcite it has been shown that as a result of external strain , fibers become rearranged and stress relaxes towards zero . in a matrix which can not support any stress , our elastic considerations do not apply and contact guidance through formerly aligned fibers might be the only relevant clue for cell organization @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to note that in our model , stress is actively generated by cells and thus needs to be supported only over time scales in which the cell actively senses the mechanical properties of its environment . in particular ,",
    "if fiber alignment has resulted in some anisotropic mechanical environment , the cell might sense the anisotropic mechanical properties of the matrix and orient itself correspondingly .",
    "this might explain why cells have been found to align to a greater extent with respect to external strain than the surrounding collagen fibrils @xcite and why our modelling is also successful for hydrogels .",
    "in general , future experiments are needed to clarify the relative importance of topographic versus mechanical clues for cell organization in hydrogels , while future modelling is needed to account for the mechanical ( in particular , viscoelastic ) properties of hydrogels .",
    "we also want to point out that contact guidance is a bidirectional clue and provides only guidance , in contrast to external elastic strain , which provides taxis . in our model ,",
    "taxis is reflected by the position dependence of @xmath15 .",
    "for example , our theory not only predicts that cells prefer to orient parallel to free boundaries , but also that cells prefer to move away from them .",
    "moreover a simple preference for cell alignment along fibers does not predict what cells do if they encounter a fiber junction in the gel .",
    "although we are not concerned with cell locomotion here , our modelling would suggest that cells prefer the fiber under largest tension , exactly as has been observed experimentally for neutrophils migrating in human amnion @xcite .    during recent years",
    ", the regulated response to mechanical input by single cells has been studied experimentally in larger detail .",
    "there is a growing body of evidence now that integrin - based cell - matrix contacts act as local mechanosensors which channel mechanical information about the environment directly into cellular decision making .",
    "although this does not concern our modelling directly , here we suggested that the upregulation of growth of cell - matrix contacts in a stiff environment might result from the fact that it is triggered by a threshold in force , whose build - up is more efficient for larger stiffness .",
    "an equivalent viewpoint is that growth of cell - matrix contacts is faster on stiffer substrates . as experimental test for this hypothesis",
    ", we suggest correlation studies for growth of cell - matrix contacts and cellular organization , especially close to sample boundaries , where cells can amplify the mechanical input provided by boundary induced strain through active mechanosensing . quantitative data about growth behavior of cell matrix contact",
    "will allow us to further refine our model in a more quantitative way , possibly also including modelling of cellular features like morphology and force pattern , which are not the focus of this work .",
    "it is important to note that our model suggests completely different behavior for cells then one would expect for physically inert particles interacting with a soft matrix ( like mobile inclusions in a metal ) .",
    "although the expression in is similar to the interaction potential for the physical system of force dipoles in an external strain field , it has the opposite sign , because in the physical system , one has to minimize the composite energy of defect and medium @xcite .",
    "the physical potential has been used before to model elastic interactions of cells without any regulatory response and has been shown to lead to aggregation behavior similar to the one of electric quadrupoles @xcite , while the model introduced here leads to aggregation behavior similar to the one of electric dipoles @xcite .    since",
    "elastic effects are long - ranged and propagate quickly , they provide an appealing mechanism for signal transduction for mechanically active cells in soft media .",
    "however , they are also unspecific and cells might not be able to distinguish between different sources . on the other hand , additional information channels , like soluble ligands , will certainly supplement elastic signals .",
    "moreover , cells in highly differentiated organisms are likely to interprete mechanical signals only in their own physiological context , which is more restricted than for cells in an arbitrary environment .    in summary , we have presented an optimization principle in linear elasticity theory that allows to predict cell organization in soft media in excellent agreement with a large body of experiments .",
    "moreover we have suggested a mechanism which links the cellular preference for large effective stiffness to growth of cell - matrix contacts .",
    "our modelling results in many interesting predictions which now can be checked experimentally . in the future , our model might be extended to high cell densities and strong cooperative effects , which are characteristic for tissue equivalents .",
    "we expect that then it can be used for rational design in tissue engineering .",
    "for example , using numerical ( finite element ) methods , one can use it to optimize protocols for the design of tissue equivalents for implants in regard to geometry and boundary conditions .",

    "<S> in particular , they might change position and become oriented in a certain direction , depending on the mechanical properties of their environment . although cellular behavior in principle results from very complex regulatory processes , </S>",
    "<S> here we show that the typical cellular reaction to mechanical input seems to be a simple preference for large effective stiffness : starting from this principle , we are able to explain many experimental findings which have been reported for the behavior of adherent cells both on elastic substrates and in hydrogels . in order to make these predictions , we have to calculate how stress and strain propagates in the extracellular environment . for this purpose , we model it with linear elasticity theory and solve the elastic equations for different geometries and boundary conditions of interest . </S>",
    "<S> we then calculate the position and orientation in which the cell senses maximal effective stiffness in its local environment . predicting cell organization in a soft medium not only contributes to a better understanding of many physiological situations , but also is of large practical value for application in tissue engineering , e.g.  when culturing fibroblasts in collagen gels . </S>"
