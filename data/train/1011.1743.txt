    "recently there has been a resurgence of interest in capillary phenomena .",
    "one area that has come to the fore because of advances in patterning techniques is the behaviour of liquids in contact with structured surfaces .",
    "these wetting systems are extremely interesting because ( i ) they often show rich static and dynamical behaviours , such as non - spherical drop shapes @xcite , morphological wetting transitions @xcite , and hysteretic phenomena @xcite , and ( ii ) further understanding in these phenomena leads to smart designs of technological applications .",
    "the latter is particularly relevant given the current rapid developments of microfluidic devices @xcite .",
    "here we consider the behaviour of a liquid bridge formed between a pair of solid bodies .",
    "investigations into such a liquid bridge geometry has a long history .",
    "early studies of this problem have been performed , e.g. by poisson @xcite , goldschmidt and delauney @xcite in the 19th century , who considered surfaces of revolution with constant mean curvature .",
    "more recent research in the field is motivated by its occurance in many different contexts .",
    "examples include but are not limited to capillary condensation and evaporation @xcite , wet adhesion @xcite , wet granular matter @xcite , atomic force microscopy @xcite and low gravity @xcite experiments .",
    "the existence of these liquid bridges often change the systems physical properties because these bridges exert forces onto the surfaces , to which they are attached .    due to its broad relevance and implications ,",
    "a number of aspects of the liquid bridge geometry have been addressed .",
    "the shape and force displacement relation of the liquid bridge have been analyzed for both flat @xcite and curved solid bodies @xcite .",
    "the stability of the liquid bridge shapes @xcite and the influence of gravity @xcite have also been investigated .",
    "these studies were primarily concerned with chemically homogeneous surfaces .",
    "recently , new patterning techniques have been developed that allow the construction of chemical surface domains on micrometer or even nanometer length scales .",
    "the corresponding liquid structures are small compared to the capillary length and gravity effects can be safely ignored . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", bridges between striped surface domains have been considered using both the theory of capillary surfaces as well as lattice gas models @xcite .",
    "in addition , polymeric nanobridges between two circular surface domains have also been studied by molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will extend these theoretical studies and consider liquid bridges in four different types of slab geometries or slit - pores : ( i ) first , we will briefly discuss the case of two identical and chemically homogeneous surfaces , which are characterized by the same contact angle ; ( ii ) second , we will consider two chemically homogenous surfaces , which differ , however , in their contact angles , a geometry that has been previously studied in ref .",
    "@xcite ; ( iii ) next , one of the two surfaces is taken to contain a circular surface domain , the contact angle of which is smaller than the contact angle of the surrounding substrate surface ; and ( iv ) finally , both surfaces are decorated by circular surface domains .    in the first two cases ,",
    "the two contact lines of the liquid bridge can move freely along the surfaces . in the cases ( iii ) and ( iv ) , on the other hand , the contact lines may be pinned by the boundaries of the chemical surface domains .",
    "the pinning strength depends on the wettability contrast between the chemical domains and the substrate surfaces .",
    "we will focus on a large wettability contrast , for which the contact lines are essentially pinned to the domain boundaries . in the latter limit ,",
    "case ( iv ) of the slab geometry or slit - pore as considered here leads to liquid bridges that are rather similar to those formed between two circular plates as studied e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the contact lines are pinned at the edges of the plates .",
    "in all four cases , we determine the behavior of the liquid bridges close to their mechanical equilibrium states .",
    "we define mechanical equilibrium by those liquid bridge configurations that exert no force on the solid plates .",
    "we will analytically calculate the equilibrium distance of the plates and then , as they are slightly perturbed from equilibrium , we shall derive the effective spring constant of the liquid bridges .",
    "this is the first time , to the best of our knowledge , that the effective spring constant has been computed . to verify our analytical results",
    ", they will be compared with numerical calculations using the surface evolver package @xcite .",
    "we note that this is , in general , a very complicated problem because it depends on the details of the surface inhomogeneities which , on real surfaces , will be random in position and spans across multiple length scales .",
    "thus , we shall limit ourselves to a subset of these possible scenarios .",
    "we focus on situations where the liquid bridge solutions still possess an axial symmetry .",
    "we shall assume that the solids are flat , smooth and parallel to each other , but the solid plates can be either chemically homogeneous or decorated by circular patches of more hydrophilic domains , compared to the remaining susbtrate surface .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will introduce our theoretical description as well as the methods that we will use to solve the problem .",
    "then we present our main results : the equilibrium distance and the spring constant of the liquid bridge as a function of the volume , contact angle , and radius of the chemical domain .",
    "a conclusion summarises our results and compares them to relevant studies in the literature .",

    ", there is an optimal contact angle ( for the homogeneous plate ) at which the spring constant is maximum .",
    "this is due to the fact that the spring constant depends on the contact angles on both surfaces .",
    "when @xmath11 is large , the spring constant is relatively weak as expected .",

    "whereas in the symmetric cases the plates have to be hydrophobic for the liquid bridge to be in mechanical equilibrium with @xmath75 , this condition is relaxed for the asymmetric scenarios as long as the sum of the contact angles is larger than @xmath0 , see eq [ sum2 ] .",
    "our model predicts that surface patterning plays an important role in the effective stiffness of the liquid bridge .",
    "we find that the spring constant diverges whenever the sum of the contact angles is @xmath0 , see figs .",

    "this can be achieved for all the cases we have considered here , except when the two walls are patterned with different radii of chemical domains . in the later case , @xmath90 and the spring constant is always finite .",
    "another generic property we observe is that the spring constant gets softer with increasing contact angle and volume .",
    "however , the maximum value of the spring constant and the rate at which it decreases depends on the properties of the two plates .",
    "for example , it is possible to devise a configuration where the spring constant is relatively soft for a large range of parameters .    in our calculations",

    "the contact line will move outward when @xmath132 and inward when @xmath133 . in this scenario ,",
    "the results we have derived here for the patterned plates are only valid for contact angles @xmath79 that satisfy @xmath134 .",
    "when the contact line is completely in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 domains , one can simply use the results for the homogeneous plates .",
    "one may also need to take into account the intrinsic contact angle hysteresis of the surfaces @xcite .",
    "here we define intrinsic contact angle hysteresis as the variation in the value of the contact angle due to roughness or chemical heterogeneities at length scale which is much smaller than @xmath6 and @xmath135 . in that case , depending on whether the contact line is advancing or receding , one should appropriately substitute the contact angle in our formula with the advancing or receding contact angle .",
    "another potential advantage of chemical patterning is that it may offer a simple way to stabilize liquid bridges against tilt perturbations . for two parallel homogeneous plates , a slight tilt or misalignment can result in a substantial displacement of the liquid bridge @xcite .",
    "such structural instability is generally an unwanted feature , although in some special cases , such as the transportation of water droplets by shorebirds @xcite , it can be of use . while it remains to be shown by explicit calculations , we expect that contact line pinning at the boundaries between the chemical domains will hinder the displacement of the liquid bridge , at least for moderate tilt angles .",
    "the results presented in this paper are relevant for a number of different physical systems where the liquid bridge geometry plays a role . for examples , vogel and steen @xcite",
    "have recently proposed a switchable capillary based adhesion device , and our calculations suggest a number of ways in which surface patterning can be used to control the stiffness of the capillary bridges and hence the strength of the adhesion . in wet granular system @xcite ,",
    "liquid bridges form and they strongly influence the stability of the system . here the curvatures of the beads may become important . thus , one useful extension of the current work will be to investigate such effects on the equilibrium distance and spring constant of the liquid bridges , particularly in situations when they are not symmetric .",
    "it is also of great interests to investigate the dynamical response of the above mentioned physical systems near equilibrium . for such studies , in addition to the results presented here , one has to take into account the viscosity of the liquid and the friction of the liquid bridge at the parallel planes , as well as solve its hydrodynamic equations of motion .",
