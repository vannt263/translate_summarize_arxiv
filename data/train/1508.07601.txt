    "symmety in physics not only is the key to understanding phases of matter but also play a vital role in unifying seemingly different things and uncovering fundamental principles underlying them . in particular , unitary groups have been playing very important roles in quantum mechanics as the orthogonal groups in classical mechanics . for instance , su(3 ) is the fundamental symmetry underlying the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) of strong interactions . in traditional condensed - matter physics , however , high symmetry like su(@xmath0 ) is usually realized , aside from few exceptions , only in rather idealized situations and has been mainly used as mathematical convenience that makes problems tractable . for instance , in the large-@xmath0 approximations , we replace the physical symmetry su(2 ) with su(@xmath0 ) and use @xmath1 as the ( small ) control parameter of the approximation hoping that there is a smooth crossover down to @xmath2 .",

    "one defining property of spt phases is the existence of gapless boundary excitations ( edge states ) that are intrinsically different from those in the gapped bulk . a modern mathematical way of observing the edge states would be to use the entanglement spectrum@xcite that is obtained solely from the ground - state wave function . in the following , we heavily use the entanglement spectrum in characterizing topological phases .    despite the recent effort@xcite in systematically enumerating possible spt phases in one dimension ,",

    "the ground state is expected dimerized@xcite , while , for two columns , we may have a gapped translationally invariant ground state@xcite , which we will argue to be topological .",
    "it has been argued in refs .   that the hamiltonian emerges as the effective hamiltonian in the mott - insulating region of the alkaline - earth cold fermions loaded in a one - dimensional optical lattice at half - filling . to emphasize the relevance of our results to experimentally realizable systems , we sketch how the model @xmath18 is derived from the cold - fermion systems in the mott region .",
    "it is known that the decoupling between the nuclear spin ( @xmath19 ) and the total electron angular momentum makes it possible to organize the @xmath20 nuclear - spin states of each atom into a multiplet of larger su(@xmath21)-symmetry .",

    "moreover , one can add one more degree of freedom ( _ orbital _ ) by taking into account the first meta - stable excited states ( in @xmath22 ; denoted as `` @xmath23 '' ) as well as the atomic ground state in @xmath24 ( `` @xmath25 '' ) . and @xmath23 , on the other hand , are internal degrees of freedom and , in the absence of the internal conversion between @xmath25 and @xmath23 , the system retains at least orbital u(1 ) symmetry . ]",
    "that this su(@xmath21)-symmetry holds for both orbitals with very high accuracy has been verified in recent scattering - length measurements@xcite .",

    "when @xmath6 , they form the 20-dimensional representation of su(4 ) . for these states ,",
    "the orbital pseudo - spin @xmath52 is quenched and only the su(@xmath0 ) degree of freedom remains .",
    "when @xmath0 is odd , on the other hand , _ both _",
    "su(@xmath0 ) spin and orbital are active and we obtain , in general , su(@xmath0)-orbital - coupled models . in the following ,",

    "in this section , we try to characterize the nature of the ground state of the su(@xmath0 ) spin chain . specifically , in sec .  [",
    "sec : es ] , we show that the ground state of the model shares essentially the same properties with that of the solvable vbs models and that it is in fact in one of the spt phases . being topological , this class of topological phases defies the traditional characterization with broken symmetries and the associated local order parameters .",
    "one way is to use the _ physical _ edge states to distinguish between topological phases from trivial ones .",
    "however , this approach is not quite satisfactory in the following respects .",
    "first , even topologically _ trivial _ states may have certain structures around the edges of the system , as , e.g. , the spin-2 heisenberg chain does@xcite .",
    "second , in order to see the edge excitations , it is necessary to consider the excitation spectrum , while the topological properties are intrinsic to the ground state itself and should be seen only by examining the ground - state wave function .",
    "recently , the use of the entanglement spectrum in characterizing topological phases has been suggested in ref .  .",
    "this is based on the observation that the entanglement spectrum _",
    "resembles _ the spectrum of the physical edge excitations .",
    "the idea has been successfully applied to various systems@xcite and enabled us to characterize topological phases and quantum phase transitions among them . in this section",
    ", we present a clear evidence from the entanglement spectrum that the ground state of the su(4 ) heisenberg model is indeed in the spt phases protected by su(4 ) [ psu(4 ) , precisely ] symmetry .      to understand the nature of the spt phases in the case of su(@xmath0 ) symmetry , it is convenient to begin with the simplest case @xmath2 . in 1983 ,",
    "haldane conjectured@xcite that the ground - state properties of the spin-@xmath10 heisenberg chain are qualitatively different according to the parity of @xmath72 ; when @xmath73 , the ground state is in a featureless non - magnetic phase ( _ haldane phase _ ) with the gapped triplon excitations in the bulk , while , for odd @xmath72 , we have a gapless ( i.e. , algebraic ) ground state with spinon excitations .",
    "this conjecture has been later confirmed both by the construction of a rigorous example@xcite [ eq .  ] and by extensive numerical simulations@xcite .",
    "soon after , it has been pointed out that the featureless gapped ground state of the integer-@xmath10 spin chains may have a _ hidden _",
    "`` topological '' order characterized by non - local order parameters@xcite _ at least _ when @xmath10 is an odd integer@xcite .    however , it was not until the concept of spt phases was established that the true meaning of `` topological order '' in the haldane phase was understood@xcite .",
    "now it is realized that the gapped phases in integer - spin chains with some protecting symmetry ( e.g. , time - reversal , reflection ) are further categorized into topological phases and the other trivial ones .",
    "to understand the difference , it is useful to consider how the ground state in question transforms under the symmetry operation . as the ground state is assumed symmetric ,",
    "_ the bulk _ does not respond to the symmetry operation but the edges do .",
    "as the consequence , the symmetry operation gets _",
    "fractionalized _ into two pieces ; one acts on the left edge and the other on the right .",
    "for instance , the vbs ground state @xmath74 of the spin-1 aklt model hosts two _ emergent _ @xmath75 spins ( i.e. , @xmath76 ) on both edges and hence transforms under the so(3 ) rotation as @xmath77 is the @xmath75 rotation matrix of su(2 ) .",
    "putting it another way , @xmath78 serves as the mathematical labeling of the physical edge states .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath78 in the above in general is a projective representation of so(3 ) as both @xmath79 and @xmath78 appear simultaneously in the equation .",
    "since this @xmath78 belongs to a non - trivial projective representation that is intrinsically different from any irreducible representations of the original so(3 ) , one sees that @xmath74 is in a non - trivial topological phase with emergent edge states . on the other hand",
    ", one can construct another exact ground state of a spin-1 chain which transforms as above but with @xmath78 belonging to the spin-1 representation . since the spin-1 representation is trivial in the sense of projective representation of so(3 ) , one can kill the would - be edge states by continuously deforming the hamiltonian@xcite and this ground state is in a trivial phase",
    ". this reasoning may be readily generalized ; when @xmath78 transforms like a half - odd - integer spin , the phase is topological , while when @xmath78 transforms in an integer - spin representation [ i.e. , linear representation of so(3 ) ] , the system is in a trivial phase .",
    "what is crucial in the topological properties is not the bulk spins at the individual sites but the _ edge _ spins .    for later convenience",
    ", we summarize the situation in terms of young diagrams .",
    "the spin-@xmath10 representation of su(2 ) is represented by the following young diagram : @xmath80 with this in mind , the above result may be summarized as follows ; when @xmath78 belongs to the representations @xmath81 the state represented by the corresponding mps is topologically non - trivial , while the phase is trivial for @xmath78 transforming in @xmath82 that is , the number of boxes ( mod 2 ) in the young diagram for the representation to which @xmath78 belongs labels the topological classes protected by so(3 ) and leads to the @xmath83 classification of the so(3 ) spt phases@xcite .      using the mps representation@xcite of the gapped ground state in one dimension ,",
    "the above `` physical '' idea can be generalized and made mathematically precise .",
    "in fact , when a given ground state that is represented by an mps @xmath84 is invariant under some symmetry @xmath85 , a @xmath86-dimensional unitary matrix @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) exists such that@xcite @xmath89 where @xmath90 denotes the @xmath91 mps matrices corresponding to the local physical state @xmath92 and @xmath93 is a phase that depends on @xmath85 . as has been mentioned above",
    ", the unitary matrix @xmath87 is in fact a projective representation of the symmetry @xmath85 , that corresponds to the physical edge states@xcite .",
    "therefore , the enumeration of topologically stable phases in the presence of symmetry @xmath85 boils down to counting the possible ( non - trivial ) projective representations of @xmath85.@xcite    this problem was solved for su(@xmath0 ) and other lie groups in ref .",
    "and the picture in the previous section basically generalizes to the case of su(@xmath0 ) with some mathematical complications .",
    "now the role of so(3 ) in the previous section is played by @xmath94 [ note @xmath95 .",
    "considering @xmath96 instead of su(@xmath0 ) amounts to restricting ourselves only to the irreducible representations of su(@xmath0 ) specified by young diagrams with the number of boxes @xmath16 divisible by @xmath0 [ i.e. , @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) ] .",
    "this subset of irreducible representations roughly corresponds to the integer - spin ones in the su(2 ) case . as in the previous section , the topological class of a given ground state ( typically written as an mps )",
    "is determined by looking at to which projective representation the unitary @xmath87 of the state belongs . since inequivalent projective representations of psu(@xmath0 ) are labeled by @xmath16 ( mod @xmath0)@xcite , there are @xmath99 non - trivial topological classes ( as well as one trivial one ) specified by the @xmath100 label @xmath101 ( mod @xmath0 ) . in the following , we use the name `` class-@xmath102 '' for these topological classes ( the class-0 corresponds to trivial phases ) .",
    "for instance , one can readily see that the `` vbs states '' ( which are different from ours ) investigated in refs .",
    "fall into the class-1 and @xmath99 of the psu(@xmath0 ) spt phases ( see link:[supplementary material ] ) . quite recently",
    ", the class-1,2 phases as well as other ( conventional ) phases of su(3)-invariant spin chains were investigated from the spt point of view@xcite .",
    "a remark is in order about the definition of the topological class .",
    "in contrast to the su(2 ) case where all the irreducible representations are self - conjugate , we must distinguish between an irreducible representation and its conjugate in su(@xmath0 ) .",
    "the relation suggests that if we have the edge state transforming under the projective representation @xmath103 on the right edge , we necessarily have its conjugate @xmath104 on the other .",
    "this means that when we talk about the topological class we must first fix which edge state we use to label the topological phases . throughout this paper ,",
    "we define the topological class by the _",
    "right edge state _",
    "[ i.e. , @xmath87 acting from the right in eq .  ] .",
    "now it is easy to see that the su(@xmath0 ) vbs state introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : solvable - ham ] belongs to class-@xmath11 .",
    "remarkably , the above - mentioned difference in the projective representation @xmath105 can be seen in the entanglement spectrum@xcite . in order to define the entanglement spectrum ,",
    "we first divide the system into two subsystems a and b. then , the entanglement spectrum @xmath106 is defined through the schmidt decomposition of the ground state @xmath107 of the entire system : @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are orthonormal basis sets for the subsystems satisfying @xmath111 and the number @xmath112 of finite @xmath113 defines the schmidt number .    according to ref .",
    ", the entanglement spectrum of a given system exhibits a structure quite similar to that of the ( energy ) spectrum of the physical edge state of the same system and might be useful in characterizing topological states of matter . in one dimension , the edge states are not dispersive and we expect a discrete set of degenerate levels to appear in the entanglement spectrum reflecting the physical gapless edge modes .",
    "in fact , in accordance with the degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum , the projective representation @xmath87 assumes a block - diagonal structure@xcite , where each block corresponds to an irreducible representation of su(@xmath0 ) compatible with the topological class .",
    "for instance , in a ground state in the class-2 topological phase of su(4 ) , each entanglement level should exhibit the degeneracy corresponding to an su(4 ) irreducible representation with @xmath114 ( mod 4 ) . in table",

    "the ground state of the su(4 ) vbs hamiltonian ( [ eqn : su4-vbs ] ) can be given exactly in the form of an mps@xcite and its entanglement spectrum is readily obtained by rendering the mps into the canonical form ( for the expressions of the matrices , see appendix [ sec : mps - matrices ] ) .",
