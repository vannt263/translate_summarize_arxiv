    "the study of the electromagnetic structure of hadrons provides an important key for our understanding of hadronic structure , since form factors reflect the charge distribution of quarks and gluons inside the hadron . during the last decades",
    "there has been considerable effort to develop models for not only the nucleon , but also hyperon and meson form factors .",
    "nevertheless , the main problematic issue is the lack of experimental verification of these models due to the lack of stable targets in the case of strange hadrons .",
    "unlike the case of the proton , where both electric and magnetic form factors [ @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be extracted directly , the measurement of charged meson ( e.g. @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) form factors requires an indirect technique .",
    "the method is known as chew - low extrapolation @xcite and based on the extrapolation of the electroproduction data to the pion / kaon pole , where the dominance of the longitudinal differential cross section can isolate the contribution of the pion / kaon form factor from the contamination of other diagrams .",
    "however , there is no certainty that such techniques are also applicable to other strange mesons and hyperons ( e.g. , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath8 ) , since the required experimental data are not available at the present .    in this paper , we suggest that kaon electroproduction may provide at least an indirect method for obtaining information on these form factors .",
    "the result presented here provides an extension of our previous report @xcite .",
    "while the cross section for an experiment using unpolarized electron beams has only four individual terms ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the differential cross section for kaon production using polarized electron , target , and recoil may be written in terms of response functions as @xcite    .complete response functions for pseudoscalar meson electroproduction  @xcite .",
    "the polarization of the target ( recoil ) is indicated by @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the last three columns ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 ) are response functions for polarized electrons .",
    "@xmath14 denotes a response function which does not vanish but is identical to another response function . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : result ]    table [ tab : result ] can tell us , which response function is suitable for measuring a certain form factor , while the contaminations from other form factors can be minimized .",
    "the longitudinal and transverse response functions of the @xmath15 reaction using two different quark models for the @xmath16 form factor are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : k0rfq2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : k0rfth ] .",
    "we found that the transverse response functions are insensitive to the @xmath0 pole as shown in table [ tab : result ] .",
    "the longitudinal response functions calculated with the form factor obtained from the lcq - model is almost 50@xmath17 larger than the calculation with no @xmath16 pole , while the qmv - model calculation lies between those two .",
    "similar sensitivities of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 response functions indicate that a rosenbluth separation is not imperative in order to isolate the @xmath16 form factor effects .",
    "figures [ fig : k0tr ] and [ fig : kptr ] show the sensitivity of different transverse response functions to the neutral and charged kaon transition form factors .",
    "since the small size of the @xmath20 coupling constant suppresses the born terms , the @xmath21 reaction is used to study the @xmath22 form factor while the @xmath23 is sensitive to the neutral transition .",
    "questions remain regarding additional @xmath24-channel resonance contributions from states like the @xmath25(1270 ) which would have a different transition form factor .",
    "the observables displayed can clearly distinguish between the different models , with the model of ref .",
    "@xcite leading to a much faster fall - off .",
    "unfortunately , the zero in the charged transition form factor around @xmath26 gev@xmath27 is not visible since the response functions are already very small at this kinematics .",
    "the large differences shown by the @xmath28 response function indicate that the unpolarized experiment would be able to distinguish the models once we had a reliable elementary production model .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lamq2 ] and [ fig : lamcth ] we show double polarization response functions for the @xmath29 reaction that involve both beam and recoil polarizations .",
    "since the @xmath1 form factor is multiplied by the large hadronic coupling constant @xmath30 , the @xmath29 channel is well suited to extract this form factor .",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath31 observables were subject of a recent tjnaf proposal  @xcite .",
    "while the @xmath13 response function shows moderate sensitivity to the different @xmath1 form factors for all momentum transfers , the @xmath31 structure function displays large sensitivities for most of the momentum transfer range shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lamq2 ] and the entire angular range , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lamcth ] .",
    "the @xmath13 response shows large sensitivities to the @xmath1 form factor for backward angles .",
    "measuring these response functions could be accomplished with clas in tjnaf s hall b.    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigpq2 ] and [ fig : sigpcth ] we show the sensitivities of the transverse and longitudinal response functions to different @xmath2 form factors in the @xmath32 process , in which @xmath2 exchange is possible .",
    "measuring this form factor has the advantage that @xmath1 and @xmath33 exchanges are not possible in the @xmath34-channel , therefore eliminating some uncertainties from the hyperon transition form factor . in previous works ,",
    "we have used proton form factors , scaled with the @xmath2 magnetic moment .",
    "we note that the cqs model predicts form factors which are very similar to those of the proton .",
    "therefore , we compare the result only with an extreme assumption , the point @xmath2 approximation .",
    "our calculations show strong sensitivities for moderate @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which could easily be seen experimentally .",
    "table [ tab : result ] indicates that one would be able to isolate these form factors using the @xmath37 and @xmath38 observables .",
    "however , this issue can only be addressed in future works , since present elementary models still suffer from intrinsic uncertainties .",
    "we have shown that kaon electroproduction on the nucleon is well suited to extract information on the form factors of strange mesons and baryons , albeit this can not be done model - independently , like the chew - low extrapolation technique in the case of the charged pion and kaon .",
    "the main problem is to reduce the uncertainties in the elementary operator .",
    "this can be performed by precise experiments in kaon photoproduction where the relevant resonances and coupling constants in the process can be determined .",
