    "the different roles of reflection mirrors of @xmath133 and @xmath134 , resp .",
    "@xmath135 and @xmath136 in the gluing procedure at @xmath61 yield that both edge classes appear in three copies on the cobweb polyhedron @xmath0 , each of both classes maintains ball - like neighborhood at each point of them .",
    "now comes our tricky constructions for identifying the former half - turn faces , furthermore the two base faces @xmath137 and @xmath138 of @xmath0 with each other ( see fig.2 and fig.4,5 ) .",
    "two from the edge triple @xmath48 ( to @xmath128 ) lie on the faces @xmath139 and @xmath140 , we introduce the deciding third edge @xmath48 ( to @xmath141 ) and the orientation preserving motions @xmath142 and its inverse @xmath143 by the mapping faces @xmath144 , @xmath145 .",

    "this general method for space filling with fundamental polyhedron , equipped by face pairing generated group , has been discussed in @xcite in more details .",

    "2 ) for edge triple @xmath73 was influenced by the trigonal symmetry of our cobweb polyhedron @xmath0 .",
    "then the triples @xmath156 follow as formulas in ( 2.8 ) show @xmath157 the last relation to edge class @xmath108 is trivial again .",
    "the procedure is straightforward now , and it nicely closes .",
    "the edge triple @xmath158 defines the face pairing motion @xmath159 the further triples @xmath160 and identifications are completely analogous .",
    "the same holds for edge triples @xmath161 , starting with the face pairing motion @xmath96 .",
    "it turns out that the first three screw motions @xmath162 can be expressed by @xmath163 and @xmath164 at triples @xmath165 , respectively : @xmath166 the relation , to the middle edge class @xmath167 of @xmath97 edges yields then the relation @xmath168 for the fundamental group of our cobweb manifold @xmath169 .",
    "but in this cyclic process , the pairing motion @xmath170 to edge class @xmath73 is not independent .",
    "symilarly to @xmath171 , as above , we cyclically obtain @xmath172 .",
    "so we get , at the edge class @xmath173 , the motion @xmath174 .",
    "@xmath175 as well .",
    "analogously , at edge class @xmath176 , we get the relation @xmath177 finally , @xmath96 can be expressed , from ( 2.12 ) and ( 2.13 ) , keeping @xmath178 symmetry , and we obtain for the fundamental group @xmath179 two relations for the three generators @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath164 . from ( 2.12 - 13 ) we get first ( a @xmath182 letters relation ) @xmath183 second , from ( 2.11 ) we obtain ( a @xmath184 letters relation ) , symmetrically with indices @xmath48 and @xmath45 , @xmath185 but we do not give more details , e.g the first homology group @xmath186 of manifold @xmath187 , by the commutator factorgroup of @xmath179 can easily be determined , etc .",
    "of course , this group @xmath111 , is a subgroup of our former @xmath188 by fig.3 .",
    "these generators @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath164 can be expressed by the former reflections @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 and the half - turn @xmath83 about @xmath84 ( fig.2,3 ) .",
    "hyperbolic metrics , defined by the coxeter - schlfli matrix ( 1.1 ) , now is specialized by @xmath192 in ( 1.3 ) and fig .",
    "3 . as it is well - known",
    ", the kronecker relations ( 1.2 ) involve that the inverse matrix of ( 1.1 ) for the coordinate orthoscheme @xmath193 , now in the form of ( 1.8 ) , determines the distance metrics of @xmath3 just by the scalar product ( of signature @xmath14 ) @xmath194 where @xmath195 in formula ( 1.8 ) is crucial .",
    "thus the ( complex ) distances @xmath196 of orthoscheme vertices @xmath197 , @xmath198 can be calculated by @xmath199 e.g. for the proper vertices @xmath47 , @xmath44 @xmath200 where @xmath201 , @xmath202 , @xmath203 < 0 , then the other distances .",
    "the points of the truncating polar plane @xmath99 , to the outer vertex @xmath204 , e.g. @xmath205 is characterized by the conjugacy @xmath206 can also be calculated .",
    "the natural length unit @xmath207 ( @xmath208 is the constant negative sectional curvature ) can be chosen to @xmath209 .",
