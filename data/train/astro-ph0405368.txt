    "the type ia supernova ( sne ) observations @xcite and the measurements on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite indicate the universe is acceleratedly expanding and is spatially flat .",
    "the faintness of high - redshift sne has been interpreted as evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerating , which suggests the universe transition from deceleration to acceleration has happened .",
    "the transition redshift of the universe from deceleration to acceleration provides us an important information of dark energy . providing that the apparent faintness of sne ia provides the direct evidence for the accelerating expansion of the universe",
    ", then it happened at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it should have happened at @xmath11 , with the best fit at about @xmath12 @xcite , or @xmath13 @xcite . using a simple expansion model , @xmath14 , and the statistical method , the transition redshift is determined to be @xmath15 @xcite . from modified friedmann equation ,",
    "the constraint from the sne ia observation gives @xmath16 @xcite . from a joint analysis of sne+cmb",
    ", one can get @xmath17 , but it can be @xmath18 for @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite . anyway , the results from astronomical observations show our universe could have undergone an expansion transition from deceleration to acceleration @xcite .",
    "the problem of the dynamical origin of the dark energy has attracted a great many attentions @xcite .",
    "current supernova , cmb , and lss data already rule out dark energy models with dark energy densities varying fast with time @xcite . from the viewpoint of geometry the scale factor of the universe",
    "is a fundamental quantity .",
    "it is possible to catch a glimpse of the nature of dark energy . rather than attempting to obtain a whole description for the universe and the dark energy , the approach here aims to construct a scale factor by using the current observations : the hubble parameter @xmath4 , the deceleration parameter @xmath5 and the transition redshift .",
    "it is expected that such a scale factor provides an approximate descriptions for the universe and the dark energy during a history of evolution including at least the transition of the universe .",
    "the determination of parameters in a parametrized quantity depends on the observations .",
    "an appropriate scale factor should satisfy at least the two requirements from the observations : the past transition of the universe from acceleration to deceleration expansion phase and the currently slow variation of the dark energy density .",
    "recently , motivated by describing the possible super - accelerated transition @xcite , we discuss the scalar factor of the form @xmath22 . in this paper",
    ", we will extend this form to @xmath0 .",
    "this needs the three observation quantities to determine the three parameters , which will be chosen to be @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in sec .",
    "ii , we determine the three parameters in the scale factor by using @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , as well as @xmath26 . in sec .",
    "iii , we show the results of dark energy produced from the above scale factor with three parameters , which illustrates that the dark energy density is slowly changing currently and the equation of state @xmath7 can change from @xmath8 to @xmath9",
    ". the latter result can give a strict constraint on the dark energy model .",
    "for each epoch , the radiation , matter and dark energy epoch , the universe may be characterized by a power - law scale factor with a constant exponent depending on the equation of state of the dominant component in that epoch . actually , the exponent change with time since the fractions of the different energy components in the universe have been varying .",
    "we begin by writing down the scale factor @xmath27 with @xmath28 a function of time , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are two constants .",
    "ftom ( [ eq1 ] ) , the hubble parameter and its derivative are @xmath31 @xmath32 where a dot denotes the derivative with respect to time .    without observations , there is no priori way of determining the scale factor .",
    "we anticipate , from our knowledge of the evolution of the universe such as the existence of the transition , that the exponent should increase with time at least from the matter - dominated epoch to today .",
    "assuming the scale factor ( [ eq1 ] ) , the simplest form of the exponent to satisfy the above requirement should be the linear approximation @xmath33 , as in @xcite , which can always be a good approximation to the regular exponent @xmath28 in an enough short time .",
    "however , we require a scale factor can well describe the universe in a long interval of time , here . for this , we will attempt to test the following form of the scale factor @xmath34 where @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 are three positive constants .    putting eq.(4 ) and @xmath35 in eqs .",

    "( [ eq9 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) gives rise to @xmath53    according to @xcite , there can be the current deceleration parameter @xmath54 . from @xcite",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table iii shows the variation of @xmath28 with time is very slow , which changes only about @xmath64 or @xmath65 in @xmath66 .",
    "this illustrates that the scale factor discussed currently can be applicable from the late matter - dominated epoch . in this section ,",
    "we have worked out the three parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 by using the three observation quantities @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in the next section",
    ", we will extract some some information of the dark energy from the scale factor with the above three parameters .",
    "though the scale factor ( [ eq1 ] ) with the exponent ( [ eq4 ] ) is somewhat an ad hoc choice , it has taken into account the actual observations such as the transition of universe from acceleration to deceleration expansion .",
    "it is expected that the power - law expansion universe proposed here can yield the consistent result with the observations for the dark energy .    for the spatially flat , isotropic and homogeneous universe ,",

    "2 shows how @xmath68 varies with time . from fig .",
    "2 , one can see that from @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) to @xmath77 the dark energy density changes only about @xmath78 for @xmath79 , this illustrates that the dark energy is slowly changing currently @xcite .",
    "the conserved equation for dark energy reads @xmath80 noting that the equation of state @xmath81 , eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) yields the approximate calculation formula of the equation of state , @xmath82 , where @xmath83 , @xmath38 and @xmath68 have been replaced by the mean variation rate @xmath84 , the mean values @xmath85 and @xmath86 for @xmath87 , respectively . from the @xmath88 formula , then there is @xmath89 where @xmath90 denotes the average of @xmath7 in @xmath91 with @xmath49 the age of the universe . taking @xmath92 , i.e. , @xmath93 , then @xmath94 , and ( [ eq16 ] ) yields @xmath95 for @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "clearly , the above values of @xmath97 can agree with the most results of the dark energy equation of state .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "2 illustrates @xmath68 has the minimum , which implies that @xmath7 can change from @xmath8 to @xmath9 at a certain future time , which is quite similar to the result @xcite that @xmath7 can be across @xmath98 at @xmath99 .",
    "looking somewhat different , these two results do nt mean any disagreement since the most observations such as the equation of state of dark energy are still given only in a quite uncertainty range .",
    "instead , it can provide an important information of the dark energy .",
    "if getting confirmed from the further observations it will provide a strong constrain on the dark energy models .    to sum up",
    ", the predicted results of the dark energy from the parametrized scale factor with three parameters show no contradiction with the known those from observations .",
    "thus , it is believed that it can give a good approximation descriptions for the universe and dark energy during a long evolution course , from @xmath100 to a future time , saying @xmath101 .",
    "we hope that the work in this paper can be the beginning of a meaningful approach on the universe evolution and the behavior of dark energy .",
