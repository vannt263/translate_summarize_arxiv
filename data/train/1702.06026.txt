    "low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbgs ) were theorized to exist by @xcite and then verified by the discovery of malin  1 @xcite .",
    "they refer to galaxies which have lower surface brightness than the background @xcite and are traditionally defined as galaxies with central surface brightness @xmath5 fainter than some threshold which varies between 22.0 and 23.0 mag arcsec@xmath6 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent studies indicate that lsbgs contribute 20% of the dynamical mass of galaxies in the universe @xcite and 30%60% of the number density of local galaxies @xcite , suggesting that the contribution of lsbgs to the universe can not be negligible . however , selection effects cause lsbgs to be underrepresented in the present - day galaxy catalogs .    compared with disk galaxies having high surface brightness ( hsb ) ,",
    "lsbgs generally tend to be dust - poor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and h  -rich , with diffuse , low - density stellar disks and metallicity @xmath7 solar abundance ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that lsbgs have been inefficient star formers over their lifetimes and have low - level star - formation activity at present ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , h   surface densities in lsbgs are often observed to be well below the critical threshold for star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nonetheless , lsbgs typically contain some signatures of ongoing star formation , including modest amounts of h@xmath0 emission from a very small number of h   regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "metallicities of stars and gas within a galaxy provide both a fossil record of its star formation history ( sfh ) and evolution .",
    "for galaxies , metallicities are traditionally represented by the oxygen abundance , 12 + log(o / h ) , which directly reflects the metal content of the gas in galaxies and indirectly reveals the metal content of the stars in galaxies that ionize the gas . for lsbgs",
    ", many previous works have demonstrated that lsbgs are metal - poor .",
    "the lsbg sample of @xcite has been measured to have low oxygen abundances , 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath8 dex .",
    "@xcite found a mean value 12 + log(o / h ) = 8.22 dex for 17 lsbgs .",
    "@xcite studied kkr17 , an lsbg dominated by h  , and measured an average 12 + log(o / h ) = 8.0 dex .",
    "the oxygen abundances of @xcite are 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath98.2 dex .",
    "apparently , most lsbgs have 12 + log(o / h ) lower than the solar value of oxygen abundance of 12 + log(o / h ) = 8.87  dex @xcite , and even lower than the transition value ( 12 + log ( o / h ) = 8.4  dex ) between metal - poor and metal - rich branches for the @xmath1 method ( see  4.3 ) . to derive gas - phase metallicities of lsbgs",
    ", spectra should be required .",
    "however , it is not easy to derive spectra of lsbgs due to their low surface brightness .",
    "fortunately , we have carried out spectroscopic observations for a sample of lsbgs . later in this paper",
    ", we will introduce this observation and then study properties which are mainly relevant to metallicities on basis of the observational data .    given the faint nature of lsbgs , with peak surface brightness @xmath10 mag arcsec@xmath6 ,",
    "it is extremely difficult to obtain spectra of their stellar continua with relatively high signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath11 ) because the sky background always dominates the signal .",
    "studies of the stellar populations of lsbgs are currently underrepresented and are based mainly on spectra of their h   regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and central portions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "but the bright h   regions contain a large fraction of o- and b - type stars , so stellar populations studied through spectra of the h   regions would be biased to younger ages . compared to observing face - on lsbgs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , ) or fiber spectroscopy , the spectral qualities can be highly improved by observing edge - on lsbgs , especially those having thin disks , with a single slit of appropriate length and width , positioned along the major axis .",
    "this scheme makes it possible , although still very difficult , to obtain reasonable - quality data .",
    "very fortunately , spectra of several few lsbgs of our sample have relatively reliable stellar continua which can be used for stellar population studies , so we additionally study stellar populations of these few lsbgs and to investigate their star formation histories as byproducts of our observations (  6.1 ) .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 describes our sample , and detailed accounts of the observations and data reduction are given in  3 and  4 .",
    "we study the physical properties of our edge - on lsbgs in  5 , including oxygen abundances in  5.1 , the luminosity - metallicity relation in  5.2 , the mass - metallicity relation in  5.3 , and the behavior of gas mass fraction versus metallicity in  5.4 . in section 6 ,",
    "we discuss stellar populations in  6.1 , stellar mass estimation in  6.2 , chemical evolution in  6.3 , and the true nature of our lsbg sample in  6.4 .",
    "finally , we conclude in  7 .",
    "a catalog of edge - on disk galaxies in sdss dr7 ( egis ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) consists of 5747 genuine edge - on galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by analyzing photometric profiles in each of the @xmath12- , @xmath13- , and @xmath14-band images ,",
    "the egis catalog provides estimates for structural parameters of the stellar disks of the galaxies , such as the disk scale height ( @xmath15 ) , radial scale length ( @xmath16 ) , and central surface brightness ( @xmath17 ) . to further study the egis catalog in combination with h   data , we correlated it with the @xmath0.40 catalog @xcite , which lists h   line sources from 40% of the area of the final blind 21  cm h   alfalfa ( arecibo legacy fast arecibo l - band feed array ) survey for local galaxies . using the transformation formula of @xcite",
    ", we derived the central surface brightness in the @xmath18 band , @xmath19 , from those in the @xmath12 and @xmath13 bands .",
    "then , according to a widely used definition of a lsbg , there are 287 galaxies in the egis-@xmath0.40 sample that can be identified as lsbgs with @xmath20 mag arcsec@xmath6 .        out of the egis-@xmath0.40 lsbg sample , only 21 galaxies ( blue filled circles in figure  [ fig : target_info](a),(b ) )",
    "are in the fall sky region ( @xmath21 ) which matched our available observing time . of the 21 galaxies , 14 galaxies",
    "have @xmath22  mag ( dashed black line in figure  [ fig : target_info ] ) , sufficiently blue to be considered as the final targets for our 3 nights in late - september 2015 .",
    "unfortunately , only 50% of the total time was useful for observations because of stormy and cloudy conditions ; we ultimately observed 9 galaxies . comparing with the 14 prepared targets ( magenta lines ) , the observed 9 galaxies ( red ) are generally consistent in distributions of @xmath19 , magnitude , color , and @xmath23 as shown in figure  [ fig : target_info](c)(f ) .",
    "furthermore , comparing with the entire egis-@xmath0.40 lsbg sample ( black ) , these 9 galaxies ( red ) sample almost the full range in @xmath19 from 22.5 to 24.5 mag arcsec@xmath6 , but they sample only the fainter part in @xmath13 ( @xmath24  mag ) and only the blue part in @xmath25 ( @xmath26  mag ) .    on the other hand , in february 2015 , we had already spectroscopically observed in a similar way several galaxies ( not confined to be lsbgs ) in the egis-@xmath0.40 catalog , but with a different telescope using spare time from another program . from these objects , there are 3 galaxies with @xmath20 mag arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "we overplot them ( blue ) in figure  [ fig : target_info ] and find that they are comparable to our observed ( fall 2015 ) 9 lsbgs in distributions of main properties .",
    "so , we add these 3 lsbgs into our 9-galaxy lsbg sample in order to enlarge the overall observed sample in this paper .",
    "we display the sdss images of the 12 edge - on lsbgs in figure  [ fig : edgeon - slit ] and list their main properties in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "statistically , @xmath19 values of the 12 lsbgs range from 22.6 to 24.4 mag arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "there is one object ( agc 228010 ; see figure  [ fig : edgeon - slit ] ) with @xmath27 ; it is a super - thin disk galaxy , previously defined to have an axial ratio between the disk scale length ( @xmath15 ) and the scale height ( @xmath16 ) in the @xmath12 band larger than 10.0 @xcite . additionally , our 12 galaxies have little ( or no ) optical bulges or central light concentrations , with @xmath28 in the sdss @xmath13 band , but they are not the only ones with @xmath28 ( see figure  [ fig : target_info](f ) ) .",

    "long - slit spectroscopy of three lsbgs in the spring sky were obtained on 2015 feb . 18 ut with the kast double spectrograph @xcite at the cassegrain focus of the 3-m shane telescope at lick observatory .",
    "a long slit 2@xmath29 wide was positioned along the major axis of each target , and the seeing was @xmath30 . for the blue side , a 452 lines mm@xmath31 grating blazed at 3306    was used in first order , yielding a wavelength range of 31506300    with a spectral resolution of 1.41    pixel@xmath31 .",
    "use of a dichroic allows simultaneous observations at longer wavelengths with the red side ; however , lick spectroscopy was obtained only with the blue side .",
    "the other nine lsbgs were observed on 2015 sep .",
    "21 ut ( seeing @xmath32 ) and sep .",
    "23 ut ( seeing @xmath33 ) with the 5-m hale telescope at palomar observatory .",
    "we used the double spectrograph ( dbsp ; * ? ? ? * ) and a @xmath34-long slit of width 2@xmath29 , positioned along the major axis of each target .",
    "a d68 dichroic was used to divide the wavelength coverage into two regions , 36716727    for the blue side ( 600 lines mm@xmath31 grating blazed at 4000   ) and 62239577    for the red side ( 600 lines mm@xmath31 grating blazed at 10,000  ) .",
    "the respective spectral resolutions are 1.078    pixel@xmath31 and 0.819    pixel@xmath31 , so both gratings resolve all possible line features of interest to us .",
    "the total exposure times at lick and palomar for a galaxy were 36007200  s , subdivided into 24 subexposures in order to remove cosmic rays and enhance the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the combined spectra .",
    "see table  [ tbl-2 ] for a log of observations .",
    "the atmosphere is a dispersive medium . at nonzero zenith angles ,",
    "a stellar image will be spread out into a small spectrum , and this spread can be significant compared to the size of the seeing disk . under these conditions , if the spectrograph slit is not oriented along the direction of atmospheric dispersion ( the parallactic angle ) , starlight at some wavelengths will not enter the narrow slit , while starlight at other wavelengths will pass into the instrument relatively unhindered .    during our observations",
    ", the slit was actually oriented along the major axis of the target object ( position angle ) instead of the parallactic angle , and the object was centered in the slit at @xmath35   . therefore , at nonzero zenith angles , object light from either wavelength end ( blue or red ) may be selectively lost . for example , as seen in table  [ tbl-2 ] , the spectrum of agc 191770 at airmass 1.08 was obtained with a 128@xmath36 2@xmath29 slit on a night when the seeing was 1.5@xmath29 .",
    "then , following the calculations of @xcite , if agc 191770 was centered in the slit at a wavelength of 6000   , it would be off center by 0.61@xmath29 at 3600    @xmath37 and by 0.05@xmath29 in the opposite direction at 6500    @xmath38 .",
    "the parallactic angle was @xmath39 east of north , but the slit was actually aligned along a position angle of @xmath40 east of north .",
    "so , if agc 191770 was a star with a gaussian point - spread function , the percentage of light entering the slit at 3600    @xmath41 , 6000    @xmath42 , and 6500    @xmath43 would be ( respectively ) 83.5 , 88.3 , and 88.3 .",
    "thus , the light loss at 3600    would be 4.8% greater than that at 6000   .",
    "differential losses are a bigger concern for point sources than for extended objects such as galaxies . for extended sources ,",
    "especially if the surface brightness is roughly constant over an area larger than the slit width , blue - end light loss from the position being observed can be partly gained back from neighboring positions within the source . the effect on the relative flux calibration",
    "will not be very large for our targets because of the following reasons .",
    "( 1 ) most spectra of our targets were observed at small airmasses ( table  [ tbl-2 ] ) . ( 2 ) our targets are edge - on galaxies with extended areas larger than the slit width ( see figure  [ fig : edgeon - slit ] ) , so the blue and red light losses are partly gained back from the neighboring positions within the objects . for completeness , we do the calculations above for all our targets ( at the midpoint of the exposures ) and list the results in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",

    "this method is good at removing sky lines but may overestimate the sky continuum blended in the object .",
    "the second one is the sky - fitting method adopted in the apall task of iraf , which uses a second - order polynomial to fit the background from the substantial sky region along the slit .",
    "this method can do well in estimating sky continuum blended in the object but does not do very well in removing sky lines .",
    "the third one is the @xcite method which makes full use of the raw image data ( before the optical distortions and spectral line curvatures have been rectified ) to model the sky background .",
    "this method is not very good for our faint objects , because it either underestimates the sky continuum or leaves sky - line residuals in our images .",
    "none of the three methods above is sufficiently good at removing both sky continuum and sky lines clearly from spectra of our faint lsbgs .",
    "however , we have no other good ideas to implement it ideally .",
    "so , for lick data which have no obvious distortions of raw images , the first  median - filter \" method has been used to simultaneously subtract the sky lines and sky continuum .",
    "however , for hale data which have relatively serious distortions of raw images , this  median - filter \" method does not do well in sky continuum subtraction , so we finally used the second method to improve the sky continuum subtraction a little better , but we warn the reader that the final spectral continuum shapes for hale spectra are still probably not accurate .      examining the extracted spectra",
    ", it appears that the reductions of the hale spectra are not good at wavelengths @xmath51   .",
    "unexpectedly , many absorption lines appear in the observed spectra of our standard stars in this blue - end region due to unresolved reasons , so we are not able to determine an accurate continuum shape for fitting the flux - calibration curve in this blue - end region .",
    "fortunately , except for agc  123165 , our lsbg galaxies all have redshift @xmath52 , so the bluest useful line ( [ o  ] @xmath533727 ) falls at @xmath54   .",
    "although we have extracted the red - side palomar hale spectra , their continuum s / n is quite low , so we abandoned using the red - side spectral continuum .",
    "however , the emission lines in the red spectra , such as [ n  ] @xmath536584 , h@xmath0 , and [ s  ] @xmath556716 , 6731 , are reasonably strong , and they could therefore be used for dust - extinction corrections and oxygen - abundance measurements .    moreover , as mentioned above , the spectral continuum shapes of the nine galaxies observed with the hale telescope are not reliable , so we will not use them to draw any firm conclusions .",
    "the gas - phase metallicity ( oxygen abundance , @xmath56 log(o / h ) ) of a galaxy is a powerful probe of the past star formation and growth .",
    "it can also constrain the current stage of galaxy evolution as it is intimately connected to the fueling and regulation of star formation .",
    "usually , flux ratios of strong optical emission lines are used as the abundance - sensitive diagnostics , such as @xmath1 , [ n  ] /[o  ] , [ n  ] /h@xmath0 , [ n  ] /[s  ] , and so on @xcite . based",
    "on extracted spectra of our lsbgs , we measure the observed fluxes of strong emission lines in the blue - side ( [ o  ] @xmath533727 , h@xmath57 , [ o  ] @xmath554959 , 5007 ) and red - side ( [ n  ] @xmath556548 , 6584 , h@xmath0 , [ s  ] @xmath556716 , 6731 ) .    an intrinsic h@xmath0/h@xmath57 flux ratio of 2.86 is assumed for case b recombination at @xmath58  k @xcite because the relative intensities of the hydrogen balmer lines are nearly independent of density and temperature .",

    "owing to the small coverage in stellar mass space , our lsbg sample is not sufficient for fitting a certain @xmath88@xmath62 relation , but galaxies in our sample are consistent with the relatively low abundances for their stellar masses .",
    "the gas consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium is the raw material out of which stars and metals are formed . in lsbgs , the largest constituent of gas is assumed to be neutral atomic hydrogen .",

    "stellar populations are the fossils of the past star formation and evolution of galaxies",
    ". however , the sky background makes it very difficult to study the faint stellar continuum and absorption lines in the entire lsbg unless very large telescopes and extraordinarily long exposure times are used . because of such difficulties",
    ", most spectroscopic studies of lsbg stellar populations have been based on spectra of the brighter bulges ( e.g. , morelli et al .",

    "a slit of appropriate width and length positioned along the major axis can generally capture light from almost all regions of an edge - on galaxy , especially of a super - thin galaxy .",
    "thus , the spectral properties may in principle be much better determined for edge - on lsbgs compared with face - on ones .",
    "if we expect to derive reliable stellar populations with full - spectrum fitting stellar population synthesis method , we must use high - quality spectra , especially with well - calibrated spectral continuum shapes . given the uncertainties associated with continuum shapes of the palomar hale spectra",
    ", we decided to use only the three lick shane spectra ( of agc  191770 , agc  228010 , and agc  253926 ) for our stellar - population study of lsbgs .",
    "all these three spectra have s / n @xmath11 in the continuum wavelength interval 47304780    and meet our requirements .    for stellar population synthesis",
    ", starlight @xcite is a widely used tool .",
    "it can derive the age and metallicity of a galaxy , as well as its extinction and velocity dispersion , by fitting its observed spectrum with a superposition of populations of various ages and metallicities from stellar population models such as starlight ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bc03 ) .",
    "we used starlight to perform stellar population synthesis for the integrated spectra of the three edge - on lsbgs observed at lick . for the reddening , both the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter cal ) law and the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ccm ) law were separately used during the fit , although the problem of dust attenuation is minimal in lsbgs because they are acknowledged to be dust poor .",
    "we show the fit plot in figure  [ fig : starlight ] .",
    "as said by @xcite , the individual stellar population components from starlight are very uncertain because the existence of multiple solutions is an old known problem in stellar population synthesis .",
    "thus , we should avoid focusing in detail on any individual stellar populations .",
    "instead , we jump straight to results based on more robust descriptions of the resultant stellar populations .",
    "as suggested in the starlight paper @xcite , a coarse but robust description of the star - formation history of our galaxies may be obtained by binning the resultant individual stellar populations onto  young \" ( y ; age @xmath99  gyr ) and `` old '' ( o ; age @xmath100  gyr ) components . in order to show the respective contributions of the two components , we provide the `` light fraction '' ( lf ) out of the total light and the `` mass fraction '' ( mf ) out of the total mass for y and o components in table  [ tbl-5 ] .",
    "results from both reddening laws ( cal and ccm ) for each lsbg seem to be consistent .",
    "qualitatively , for both light and mass , the contributions from the o components seem to be much larger than those from the y components for these three lsbgs .",
    "thus , rather than a quantitative conclusion , we can draw a qualitative conclusion that these three lsbgs may have a potential dearth of stars with ages @xmath3  gyr . instead , they are more likely to be dominated by stars with ages @xmath4  gyr .",
    "this supports the general notion that lsbgs have a very low level of current star - formation activity .    comparing with the previously measured subsolar gas - phase metallicities for the first three galaxies in table  [ tbl-3 ] , their stellar metallicities ( from stellar population synthesis ; table  [ tbl-5 ] )",
    "are about solar . on one hand",
    ", this inconsistency is likely to be caused mainly by the large uncertainties of the stellar metallicities . as can be deduced from the amount of work devoted to this topic of stellar population synthesis , recovering the stellar content of a galaxy with",
    "accurately quantitative ages and metallicities from its observed integrated spectrum is not an easy task .",
    "it needs a high - quality integrated spectrum , as well as models which are made and calibrated to mimic nature to the greatest degree .",
    "any stellar population model , such as starlight ( bc03 ) , is based on a stellar library .",
    "usually , the stellar library does not sample a sufficiently wide range in metallicity , making stellar metallicity notoriously more difficult to access than other properties .",
    "also , to get the metallicity correct , one must have correct ages , as they affect one another in these integrated spectral fits .",
    "since our derived stellar ages have large uncertainties , the stellar metallicities are necessarily also poorly constrained .",
    "so , stellar metallicities determined here from stellar population synthesis ( table  [ tbl-5 ] ) carry large uncertainties , and are not reliable as specific values for comparisons and scientific studies ; the gas - phase metallicities ( table  [ tbl-3 ] ) from the emission - line flux ratios are much more reliable .",
    "we use the blue - side spectra for studying stellar populations by full - spectrum fitting , so the accuracy of the relative flux calibration becomes an important factor for the reliability of the stellar population results .",
    "if the slit is not positioned along the atmospheric dispersion , the light loss at blue - end wavelengths would be greater than that at red - end wavelengths . as shown in table  [ tbl-2 ] in section 3.2 ,",
    "if a star was being centered at 6000    and observed with the same slit positioning schemes and observing configurations as those in our program , it will be off center by 0.61@xmath29 at 3600    and 0.05  @xmath29 in the opposite direction at 6500    for agc  191770 , by 0.8@xmath29 at 3600    and 0.06@xmath29 in the opposite direction at 6500    for agc  228010 , and by 0.8@xmath29 at 3600    and 0.06@xmath29 in the opposite direction at 6500    for agc  253926 .",
    "the light loss at 3600    is ( respectively ) 4.8% , 15.2% , and 0.6% greater than that at 6500    for agc  191770 , agc  228010 , and agc  253926 .",
    "obviously , the relative blue - light loss of agc  228010 is the largest among the three galaxies .",
    "however , such an amount of light loss is calculated under the assumption that our targets were stars .",
    "actually , as seen in figure  [ fig : edgeon - slit ] , they are galaxies with extended areas larger than the slit width .",
    "so , the lost blue light is partly gained back from the neighboring pixels , and the effect on relative flux calibration of blue - end spectra is not that significant , although it still exists .",
    "the probable light loss at blue - end wavelengths ( @xmath101   ) would cause an underestimate of late a - type stars . even with some blue - light loss",
    ", we could still obtain the same qualitative conclusion that these three lsbgs have a potential dearth of stars with ages @xmath3  gyr because late a - type stars typically have ages older than @xmath74  gyr .      limited by the reliability of a spectral continuum , the number of spectra that we can use for a possibly reliable conclusion from full - spectrum fitting is only three .",
    "undoubtedly , this is from a representative sample of the whole edge - on lsbg sample , and not even representative of our final 12 observing targets .",
    "thus , conclusions from the three galaxies may not apply more generally to lsbgs . to get more universal conclusions on stellar populations of lsbgs",

    ", @xmath62 is best expressed as an elemental abundance in logarithmic form . for oxygen , following @xcite",
    ", this equation can be rewritten as    @xmath115    in a plot of oxygen abundance , 12 + log(o / h ) , against inverse gas mass fraction , conveyed by loglog(@xmath116 ) , the closed - box model predicts a slope of unity . deviations from this slope may be an indication for the inflow or outflow of gas .",
    "the oxygen yield , @xmath117 , can be derived from the intercept of the plot .",
    "following @xcite , for the field dirrs , there is an excellent correlation represented by a line with a slope of unity ( green solid line in figure  [ fig : gas_metal ] ) which is consistent with the closed - box model of the chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "the standard deviation of the fit is 0.126 dex in log(o / h ) . from the intercept of the line ,",
    "the effective oxygen yield by mass ( @xmath117 ) for the field dirrs from @xcite is 2.22@xmath11810@xmath119 .",
    "obviously , the lsbg data ( purple open triangles ) from @xcite are generally consistent with the field dirr data ( green open squares ) and can also be fitted by the closed - box model fit ( green solid line ) of @xcite , albeit with more scatter .",
    "we can not tell for sure whether our lsbg sample can be explained with the closed - box model by fitting ; our sample is too small and also too narrow in the coverage of both gas mass fraction and gas - phase metallicity to show a true relation , even if some essential relations do indeed exist .",
    "however , to compare with the field dirrs from @xcite and the lsbgs from @xcite , we still forced our lsbg data ( all filled circles with `` @xmath2-based '' stellar mass ) to be fitted by a line with a slope of unity ( red solid line ) .",
    "the standard deviation of this fit is 0.27 dex in log(o / h ) . from this artificial fitting ,",
    "the effective oxygen yield by mass for our lsbg sample is @xmath120 under the assumption of a closed - box model .",
    "the value of true yield is often considered to be the solar oxygen abundance by mass . for the sun , the oxygen abundance is @xmath70 log(o / h ) @xmath121  dex @xcite , which is @xmath122 by mass .",
    "apparently , the effective oxygen yield for our lsbg sample is larger than that for the dirr sample , and is 69% of the value for the true oxygen yield .",
    "the difference between the effective and true yields roughly represents the fraction of metal lost ( up to 30% ) up to now @xcite .",
    "such a value of metal loss can be reasonable since it is often argued that lsbgs have shallow potential wells , making it easier for mass loss to occur .",
    "however , given the substantial uncertainties in both metallicity and gas mass fraction for our lsbg sample , this mass - loss value of 30% is only a rough estimate , and we can not completely rule out a closed - box scenario .",
    "additionally , judging from the offset between the two closed - box lines in figure  [ fig : gas_metal ] , we find evidence that our lsbgs retain up to @xmath123 times as much of their metals compared with dwarf irregulars ( green squares ) , consistent with metal retention being related to galaxy mass . in any case , although the closed - box scenario can not be completely ruled out for our lsbg sample , there is still substantial room for considering other , more complicated chemical evolution models with outflow or even infall ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for our lsbg sample .      in the @xmath2-based stellar masses ( table  [ tbl-4 ] )",
    ", our lsbg sample is estimated to be @xmath124@xmath112 m@xmath80 , showing no fundamental differences from prominent spiral galaxies .",
    "furthermore , comparing with previously published luminosity - metallicity plots for lsbgs and other galaxy types ( figure  [ fig : lumi_metal ] ) , our lsbg sample agrees well with the lsbg sample of @xcite and also generally the sample of normal galaxies . in the mass - metallicity plot ( figure  [ fig : mass_metal ] ) ,",
    "our lsbg sample is also consistent with the lsbg sample of @xcite and with the relatively low abundance for their stellar mass , which is appropriate for normal galaxies .",
    "therefore , from the behavior in the @xmath71@xmath62 and @xmath88@xmath62 plots , our lsbg sample does not seem to be fundamentally different from normal disk galaxies .    regarding the plot of gas mass fraction versus oxygen abundance ( figure  [ fig : gas_metal ] ) , we prefer the @xmath2-based stellar masses ( black or red filled circles ) .",
    "our lsbg sample is not likely to be explained by simple closed - box models , although the galaxies evolve in relative isolation .",
    "systematically biased to larger gas mass fractions , our lsbg sample has higher oxygen abundances for smaller gas mass fractions , which is also shown by other samples . such qualitative agreement in gas mass fraction versus",
    "metallicity distribution makes the lsbgs seem consistent with other galaxy types .",
    "we therefore suggest that lsbgs are probably not fundamentally different from normal galaxies , but are just the continuous extension to the lower surface - brightness end of normal disk galaxies .",
    "we have obtained long - slit spectra of 12 edge - on lsbgs selected from the egis-@xmath7240 sample .",
    "observations were made with the kast spectrograph on the 3-m shane telescope at lick observatory for 3 galaxies and with the double spectrograph on the 5-m hale telescope at palomar observatory for 9 galaxies .",
    "we adopted a median - filter method to estimate the sky background of objects observed at lick observatory and a second - order polynomial to fit the sky background of objects observed at palomar observatory , which can be comparable to or even exceed the galaxy surface brightnesses .",
    "the stellar populations of three of the lsbgs were studied with the program starlight , as their spectral quality is sufficiently high .",
    "we find that our lsbgs are dominated by stellar populations with ages @xmath4  gyr and have a potential dearth of stars with ages @xmath3  gyr .",
    "this indicates that lsbgs probably have a very low level of star - formation activity over the past 1  gyr , which may be the most likely explanation for their low surface brightness .",
    "we have measured oxygen abundances ( 12 + log(o / h ) ) using both the @xmath1 and [ n  ] /h@xmath0 diagnostics after performing reddening corrections for the observed fluxes of emission lines .",
    "the @xmath1-based metallicities are 8.008.62 , with a mean of 8.30 dex and a median of 8.26 dex .",
    "the [ n  ] /h@xmath0-based metallicities are 7.678.54 , with a mean of 8.20 dex and a median of 8.26 dex .",
    "the two sets of oxygen abundances are consistent with each other .",
    "comparing with the luminosity - metallicity relation established in previous work on lsbgs , normal spirals , and other galaxy types , our lsbgs tend to be consistent with normal galaxies .",
    "we derive two sets of stellar masses for our lsbg sample .",
    "one set is the @xmath2-based stellar masses which are @xmath125@xmath112 m@xmath80 , and the other set is the @xmath18-based stellar masses which are @xmath126@xmath127 m@xmath80 , 0.5 order of magnitude lower .",
    "we argue that the @xmath2-based stellar masses are better for our lsbg sample because such galaxies primarily consist of low mass stars which radiate their light mostly at red and infrared wavelengths .",
    "stellar masses derived from the @xmath18 band might be underestimated . according to the @xmath2-based stellar masses , our lsbgs are comparable to normal spiral galaxies in stellar mass , but they have considerably lower abundances .    in the plot of gas mass fraction versus oxygen abundance",
    ", we find that like other galaxy types , our lsbgs with relatively high `` @xmath2-based '' stellar masses have lower metallicities for higher gas mass fractions .",
    "regarding the chemical evolution of our sample , the lsbg data appear to allow for up to 30% metal loss , but we can not completely rule out the closed - box model . additionally , we find evidence that our galaxies retain up to about 3 times as much of their metals compared with dwarfs , consistent with metal retention being related to galaxy mass .    combining the above conclusions , our lsbg sample is generally consistent with the luminosity - metallicity , mass - metallicity , and gas mass fraction - metallicity plots of normal spiral galaxies and other galaxy types ( e.g. , dirrs , starbursts ) .",
    "thus , we speculate that lsbgs are probably not fundamentally different from normal galaxies , but rather are just the continuous extension in surface brightness to the low end .",
