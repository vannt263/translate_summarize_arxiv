    "omc 2 contains some of the most luminous infrared and sub - mm sources in the orion a molecular cloud outside of the orion nebula @xcite . over the last few decades",
    ", several surveys from infrared to radio wavelengths disentangled the multitudes of sources found in this region , revealing young stellar objects in different evolutionary stages , ranging from deeply embedded protostars to young stars surrounded by disks @xcite .",
    "the first near - ir images of omc 2 by @xcite revealed a small cluster of five bright ir sources in a region 90 , or 0.2 pc , in diameter .",
    "these have subsequently been shown to be young stellar objects with luminosities ranging from 20 to 300  @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "subsequent sub - mm and mm imaging @xcite showed that in the center of this small cluster is a bright sub - mm source .",
    "this object , omc-2 fir 4 , is the brightest sub - mm ( 350 - 1300  @xmath0 m ) source the omc 2 region .",
    "it is connected through filamentary structures to two other adjacent sources that are bright at sub - mm wavelengths and are coincident with two of the bright ir sources of @xcite : omc-2 fir 3 matches a protostar @xmath2 28  to the north ( also known as sof 2n or hops 370 ) , while omc-2 fir 5 agrees with a protostar  @xmath2 17  to the south ( sof 4 or hops 369 , see @xcite )",
    ". outside of the massive star - forming region omc-1 in the orion nebula , fir 4 is the brightest 870  @xmath0 m source in the orion a cloud ( stanke et al .",
    "2014 , in preparation ) .",
    "although bright in the sub - mm , fir 4 was not detected in the near - ir by @xcite and only tentatively associated with a near- to mid - ir source by @xcite .",
    "the detection of a 3.6 cm source with the vla toward fir 4 was the first compelling evidence that the sub - mm source contained a deeply embedded protostar ; the elongated radio source was interpreted as free - free emission originating from shock - ionized gas in an outflow launched by a protostar @xcite .",
    "fir 4 also coincides with the iras source 05329 - 0512 .",
    "its bolometric luminosity , integrated over an area of 50@xmath450  around it , was estimated to be 420 @xmath1  @xcite .",

    "@xcite constructed a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for fir 4 by retrieving archived mid - infrared to millimeter observations and extracting fluxes .",
    "they modeled the sed and derived a total luminosity of 1000 @xmath1 .",
    "more recently , the infrared emission from a protostar toward fir 4 ( known as sof 3 or hops 108 ) was resolved by @xcite using 2  to 19  resolution data from the _ spitzer space telescope _ @xcite , the _ stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy _ ( sofia ; * ? ? ?",

    "this work has cast doubt on the high luminosity of omc-2 fir 4 ; modeling of the seds by @xcite found that the intrinsic luminosity lies in the 30 - 50 @xmath1  range .",
    "these data also showed that within the beam of iras , the other near - ir sources originally found by @xcite dominated the flux out to 70 @xmath0 m with luminosities varying from 20 to 300  @xmath1 ; omc-2 fir 3 ( sof 2n , hops 370 ) was found to be the most luminous source in the region .    only at wavelengths @xmath5",
    "160  @xmath0 m does fir 4 dominate ; however , it is unclear whether the entire sub - mm emission is associated with the protostar observed at shorter wavelengths .",
    "millimeter interferometry by @xcite resolved fir 4 into 11 dusty cores .",
    "furthermore , they found that high - velocity gas traced by co is dominated by an outflow from fir 3 .",
    "they proposed that the motion seen in the dense gas toward fir 4 could be explained by the interaction of the powerful outflow from fir 3 with the fir 4 clump . on the basis of interferometric observations made in both continuum and line , @xcite interpreted fir 4 as containing three distant components , a western core , a southern core and a main core containing a young star , with a total mass of 9.2 to 25.7  @xmath3 . noting the lack of the detection of outflow signatures from fir 4 in their interferometric observations and the proposal of @xcite that motions in fir 4 are driven by an outflow from fir 3 , they suggested that the 3.6 cm source is due to photo - ionization of gas by an early - type ( b3@xmath6b4 ) star with a luminosity of 700 - 1000 @xmath1  within one of the three components",
    ".    in this publication , we use _ spitzer _ , _ herschel _ , and apex imaging of fir 4 from 3.6 to 870  @xmath0 m obtained for the herschel orion protostar survey ( hops ) to study the protostar associated with fir 4 , with the goal of resolving the large uncertainties in the luminosity of the protostar and its relationship to the sub - mm clump .",

    "some emission can also be seen at 4.5 @xmath0 m and 5.8 @xmath0 m , but there is no well - defined point source at these wavelengths . at 5.8 @xmath0 m , there seem to be two emission peaks , one that matches the 8 and 24 @xmath0 m position , and one slightly offset , while at 4.5 @xmath0 m there is a strong emission peak only at the offset position .",
    "the detection of emission offset relative to the peak position seen at 8 - 70 @xmath0 m could be an indication of an outflow ( see section [ outflow ] ) .",

    "its flux contribution at wavelengths @xmath5 15 @xmath0 m is small ( its mips 24 @xmath0 m flux is 0.57 jy , compared to 1.5 jy for fir 4 ) .",
    "there is a discrepancy between the mips 24 @xmath0 m flux of fir 4 and the 24 @xmath0 m flux derived from irs spectra in that the irs flux is a factor of 2 too high .",
    "this could be due to the fact that more extended emission from the filament was included in the irs measurement ( slit width of 10.5  compared to the typical fwhm of the mips 24 @xmath0 m psf of @xmath2 6 ) .",
    "the irs spectrum was scaled by 0.5 to match the mips 24 @xmath0 m flux . when compared to the sofia / forcast measurement at 37.1 @xmath0 m from @xcite , where fir 4 appears as a point source ,",
    "the irs spectrum is about a factor of 1.3 - 1.9 too high ( the range considers the calibration uncertainty of the 37.1 @xmath0 m flux ) , roughly consistent with the discrepancy found for the mips 24 @xmath0 m flux .    at 70 and 160 @xmath0 m , emission towards omc-2 fir",
    "4 can be clearly discerned ( figure [ hops108_images ] ) .",
    "fir 4 is part of a dense filament extending from fir 3 ( hops 370 ) to the north . at 70 @xmath0 m",
    ", a point source can be seen near the position of the spitzer 8 and 24 @xmath0 m source . to compare the position of the pacs sources to those in the _ spitzer _ images , the pacs maps have been re - centered based on the average offsets between the _ spitzer _ and pacs 70 @xmath0 m observations of the hops targets in the field ( see figure [ hops108_p70_positions ] ) .",
    "the offsets were determined independently for the four distinct images constructed from the four separate groups of pacs scans that covered fir 4 as part of the hops program . in these four images , the 70 @xmath0 m position of fir 4",
    "is offset from the _ spitzer _ position by 0.4  to 1.4  ( figure [ hops108_p70_positions ] ) , much smaller than the fwhm of 7   at 70 @xmath0 m .",
    "these offsets are comparable to the offsets found for the other hops sources in each group and match the positional uncertainty expected from the _ herschel _ pointing accuracy of @xmath2 2 .",
    "the offset between the _ spitzer _ and pacs 70 @xmath0 m data in right ascension is @xmath2 0.7 - 1  larger for fir 4 than the median offset for the other 70 @xmath0 m sources in three of the four images ; for the fourth image ( constructed from group 135 scans ) , the offset for fir 4 and the median offset agree within 0.2 .",
    "however , in each group there are other objects with similar right ascension offsets as fir 4 , so it is not exceptional .",
    "thus , we conclude that the spitzer 8 , 24 and 70  @xmath0 m objects are coincident to within the accuracy of our data .",

    "the squares identify all hops targets observed in these groups , with fir 4 shown with a filled star symbol .",
    "the open diamonds represent the median offsets found for the objects in the four groups .",
    "[ hops108_p70_positions ] ]    similarly , the 160 @xmath0 m map was corrected using the offsets derived from the 70 @xmath0 m observations , given that it was observed at the same time .",
    "there is an offset between the 70 @xmath0 m source and the peak of the 160 @xmath0 m emission : the brightest part of the extended emission is about 3  to the northwest of the mid - ir ( and 70 @xmath0 m ) position of fir 4 .",
    "this 160 @xmath0 m peak also overlaps in position with the peak seen at 350 and 870 @xmath0 m , suggesting that , as opposed to the `` warm '' ( @xmath9 70 @xmath0 m ) peak resulting from envelope emission , the `` cold '' peak could arise from externally heated dust ( see section [ clump ] ) .",
    "although there is a clear peak in the @xmath10 @xmath11 160  @xmath0 m emission towards fir4 , the source in these bands is markedly extended and is not a point source .",
    "we carried out aperture photometry at 70 and 160 @xmath0 m by centering on the peak of the emission in each band .",
    "with aperture photometry at 70 @xmath0 m using an aperture radius of 9.6 , a sky annulus of 9.6 - 19.2 , and an aperture correction factor of 1.364 , we derived a flux of 132.5 jy ( the sky emission , i.e. , the mode of fluxes inside the sky annulus , amounted to just 0.1 jy ) . however , when applying psf photometry , we derived 40.8 @xmath12 4.7 jy ( see ali et al .",
    "2014 , in preparation , for details ) .",
    "it is clear that aperture photometry includes a large contribution of the extended , filamentary emission around fir 4 , so psf photometry should yield a more reliable source flux at 70 @xmath0 m .",
    "the residual images from the psf fits indicated that only a small amount of extended emission was left around the position of fir 4 .",
    "thus , the flux value from psf photometry might underestimate the true emission from the protostar at 70 @xmath0 m , but not by much .",
    "the pacs 160 @xmath0 m flux is similarly affected by extended emission .",
    "fir 4 is brighter than its northern neighbor fir 3 , but it is embedded in the filament connecting both .",
    "aperture photometry at 160 @xmath0 m , centered on the brightness peak at 160 @xmath0 m , with an aperture radius of 12.8 , sky annulus of 12.8 - 25.6 , and an aperture correction factor of 1.515 , yielded a flux of 611.2 jy ( once again , the sky emission was low , just 1.3 jy ) .",
    "on the other hand , psf photometrym , we adopted the source flux of the brightest object within 8  of the expected position in each observation and averaged these fluxes .",
    "] resulted in 270.2 @xmath12 8.4 jy .",
    "this flux is a slightly better estimate of the envelope emission at 160 @xmath0 m , but given that there is no distinct point source at this wavelength , it probably still has a large contribution from extended emission .",
    "also , the positional offset between the 70 and 160 @xmath0 m peak indicated that it is possible that the main contribution to the 160 @xmath0 m emission stems from externally heated dust in a massive core that encompasses the protostar ( see section [ clump ] ) , and thus the emission from the envelope itself could be very small .",
    "for the pacs 100 @xmath0 m flux , we only had aperture photometry available ; adopting the same aperture radius and sky annulus as for the 70 @xmath0 m data , and an aperture correction factor of 1.440 , we derived 287.7 jy for the flux at 100 @xmath0 m .",
    "since this value very likely overestimates the intrinsic flux from fir 4 , we treat it as an upper limit .",
    "the morphology of omc-2 fir 4 is similar at 160 and 350",
    "@xmath0 m ( figure [ hops108_images ] ) .",
    "it is the brightest object in the area , but embedded in extended emission . to derive a saboca 350 @xmath0 m flux for this object",
    ", we adopted its beam flux of 43.2 jy ( the saboca beam has a fwhm of 7.34 ) , with the centroid determined within a box of size 1.65 @xmath4 fwhm around the _ spitzer _ position to account for potential offsets .",
    "thus , the beam flux was centered at the brightness peak of the 350 @xmath0 m emission from fir 4 .",
    "aperture photometry with a radius of 3.67   ( and no sky subtraction ) yielded 29.3 jy ; aperture photometry adopting a radius of 7.34  and a sky annulus of 11.0 - 14.7  resulted in 54.7 jy .    at 870 @xmath0 m ,",
    "fir 4 is clearly the brightest object , but it is also extended ( figure [ hops108_images ] ) .",
    "the laboca 870 @xmath0 m beam flux ( beam fwhm of 19 ) amounted to 8.4 jy ; also at 870 @xmath0 m , the centroid position of the source was determined separately , with the _ spitzer _ position as starting point .",
    "aperture photometry using a radius half the fwhm and no sky subtraction yielded 5.1 jy , while aperture photometry within a radius of 19  and sky annulus of 28.5 - 38   resulted in 12.3 jy .",
    "@xcite reported similar saboca and laboca beam fluxes for fir 4 .",
    "figure [ hops108_sed ] shows the sed of omc-2 fir 4 constructed with the data mentioned in the previous section . as discussed earlier , the irs spectrum displays deep ice absorption features in the 5 - 8 @xmath0 m region ( due to water ice , methanol , and other organic species ) , and its silicate absorption feature centered at 10 @xmath0 m is also very deep ( with no detected flux over the wavelength interval of maximum absorption ) . the co@xmath13 ice feature at 15.2 @xmath0 m is , in comparison , less pronounced .",
    "the change in slope in the spectrum beyond about 30 @xmath0 m is very likely due to a strong water ice absorption , which is fairly broad and centered at @xmath2  45  @xmath0 m .",
    "the sed plot also shows the fluxes derived from aperture photometry for pacs , saboca , and laboca data . the difference between aperture and psf photometry is quite large for pacs fluxes ( factors of 3.2 and 2.3 at 70 and 160 @xmath0 m , respectively ) , but smaller at 350 and 870 @xmath0 m ( factors of 1.3 and 1.5 , respectively ) .        as mentioned in section [ data ] , there seems to be a @xmath2 3  offset in the position of the emission peak between data at 8 - 70 @xmath0 m and @xmath5 160 @xmath0 m .",
    "when deriving fluxes using aperture photometry , we re - centered at the peak position in each wave band ( this is standard procedure for all our targets in the hops sample ) ; thus , at longer wavelengths , the aperture was not centered at the same position as was used for the fluxes below 100 @xmath0 m . if the far - ir and sub - mm emission is dominated by an externally heated clump of molecular material ( which is likely the case ; see section [ clump ] ) , then our 100 , 160 , 350 , and 870 @xmath0 m fluxes overestimate the emission from the protostar itself and should rather be taken as upper limits .",
    "however , using these fluxes gives an idea of the maximum luminosity that could possibly be associated with the protostar omc-2 fir 4 .    to calculate the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath14 ) from the observed sed , we first rebinned the irs spectrum to exclude those parts of the spectrum dominated by ices and to smooth over noisy regions ( see figure [ hops108_sed ] ) .",
    "this resulted in flux values at 5.4 , 6.45 , 7.5 , 8.1 , 8.6 , 16.5 , 19.0 , 23.0 , 27.0 , 31.0 , and 35.0 @xmath0 m that trace the continuum emission and part of the short - wavelength wing of the broad silicate absorption feature centered around 10 @xmath0 m . if we use the measured _",

    "the corresponding bolometric temperature ( @xmath15 ) is 34.1 k. neither interpolation of fluxes between the sampled values nor extrapolation of fluxes at wavelengths below 5.4 @xmath0 m and beyond 870 @xmath0 m was done .",
    "however , even when we extrapolated the long - wavelength fluxes out to 10 mm using a power law @xmath16 , we derived the same @xmath14 value and a @xmath15 value that is nearly identical , 34.0 k. since the fluxes in the near - infrared are very small , likely much less than 10 mjy , they would not affect the resulting @xmath14 value .",

    "we also ran new model calculations using the same monte carlo code of @xcite for a more in - depth exploration of the parameter space .",

    "we first used a polynomial - shaped cavity , as in our model grid , then a streamline - shaped cavity , since the cavity shape can have a large effect on the resulting model sed ( especially if the cavity opening angle is large ) , but for fir 4 is not constrained by observations .",

    "compared to the models with polynomial - shaped cavities , the models fitting fluxes from aperture photometry at long wavelengths ( models 7 and 9 vs.  models 3 and 5 ) have larger @xmath28 values and cavity opening angles , while these parameters are quite similar for the models fitting just the mid - infrared fluxes and the flux from psf photometry at 70 @xmath0 m ( models 8 and 10 vs.  models 4 and 6 ) .",
    "thus , to reproduce large flux values in the far - ir and a steeply rising sed in the mid - ir , a model with a streamline - shaped cavity requires a larger cavity opening angle and a much higher total luminosity than models with polynomial - shaped cavities .",
    "this latter type of cavity evacuates more material in the inner envelope than a streamline - shaped cavity , and as a result more shorter - wavelength photons can reach the observer . in the extreme case of model 9 , where @xmath35 540 @xmath1  is required , the streamline - shaped cavity also has to have an opening angle of 50  such that sufficient infrared flux escapes from the envelope .",
    "interestingly , the models with the streamline - shaped cavity have envelope densities similar to those of the models with the polynomial - shaped cavity .",
    "the higher - luminosity models still require envelopes denser by up to an order of magnitude .",
    "for each of the models , table [ models ] lists their @xmath22 value , which is a measure for the goodness - of - fit introduced by @xcite ( see also furlan et al .",
    "2014 , in preparation ) .",
    "@xmath22 is defined as follows : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the weight for each data point , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the observed and model fluxes , respectively , and the sum is over the number of data points .",
    "the weights were set to the inverse of the approximate fractional uncertainty of each flux measurement and ranged from 1/0.04 to 1/0.4 ( with more weight given to the 3 - 70 @xmath0 m region ; see furlan et al .",
    "2014 , in preparation , for details ) .",
    "when calculating @xmath22 values for the various models , we used the same photometry values and rebinned irs fluxes ( see figure [ hops108_sed ] and section [ sed ] ) in the mid - ir , but at longer wavelengths we included aperture photometry at @xmath40 70 @xmath0 m for models 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9 , and only the 70 @xmath0 m psf photometry at 70 @xmath0 m for models 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 .",
    "thus , the @xmath22 values for the latter set of models are in general lower than those for the former set .",
    "overall , most models have @xmath22 values in the 3 - 4 range ; from a visual inspection of figure [ hops108_sed_models ] , they are indeed quite comparable , with the most noticeable differences in the near - ir and in the depth of the 10 @xmath0 m silicate feature , where there is little to no emission in both the observed and modeled fluxes ( and thus they do not have a measurable effect on the @xmath22 value ) .",
    "so far , the models calculated for this work do not include any foreground extinction . as mentioned earlier and shown in figure [ hops108_sed_models ] ( a ) , extinction will depress the near- and mid - ir fluxes and leave the far - ir and sub - mm fluxes unchanged .",
    "thus , its effect is similar to that of the inclination angle ; dust in a highly inclined envelope will cause more extinction of photons on their way to the observer . in figure [ hops108_models_av ]",
    "we explored the effect of foreground extinction on two of the high - inclination models ( models 5 and 6 ) .",
    "they are shown with their best - fit inclination angle ( 63  and 70 , respectively ) and no additional extinction along the line of sight , and with a low inclination angle of 31  and foreground extinction large enough such that the model fluxes still roughly reproduce the observed sed . with a low inclination angle , model 5",
    "requires @xmath33=120 , while model 6 needs @xmath33=55 .",
    "even though these latter models could benefit from tweaking some parameters , they demonstrate that inclination angle and foreground extinction are highly degenerate parameters .",
    "thus , our models with high luminosity either require a large foreground extinction or a more edge - on orientation .    to examine the effect of a significant contribution from extended , externally heated emission to the far - infrared and submillimeter fluxes , we used a model that fits the mid - infrared data points and the psf photometry at 70 @xmath0 m and added a modified blackbody ( for the latter , we used the same dust opacities from @xcite adopted for our models ) .",
    "all the other models presented so far do not include such a component ; the long - wavelength fluxes are just fit by emission from the disk and envelope .",
    "we chose model 4 to represent the protostar , but since models 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 all have similar seds in the 20 - 1000 @xmath0 m range and @xmath14 values of 12 - 14 @xmath1 , the choice of model does not affect the results . with the combined protostar and blackbody model , we aimed to fit the aperture photometry fluxes at long wavelengths , since they are most likely dominated by extended emission . the best - fit combination of model 4 and a modified blackbody is shown in figure [ hops108_sed_mbb_model ] ; it requires a blackbody temperature of 18.5 k. the pacs 70 , 100 , and 160 @xmath0 m fluxes are fit well , while the 350 @xmath0 m flux is overestimated and the 870 @xmath0 m flux slightly underestimated .",
    "the discrepancy at 350 @xmath0 m is likely an aperture effect , given the small aperture used at this wavelength .",
    "the combined bolometric luminosity of model 4 and the 18.5 k blackbody amounts to 76 @xmath1 , which is very similar to the @xmath14 value measured from the observed sed with the mid - ir data , aperture photometry at 70 , 100 , and 160 @xmath0 m , and the beam fluxes in the sub - mm ( see section [ sed ] ) .",
    "the contribution of the modified blackbody to this @xmath14 value is 62 @xmath1 , leaving just 14 @xmath1  as @xmath14 for the protostar .",

    "depend strongly on which apertures are used .",
    "the larger the aperture , the more envelope emission , but also extended emission from the surrounding filament and emission from neighboring sources is included .",

    "2014 , in preparation ) .",
    "choosing larger radii risks including surrounding emission that is not associated with the envelope .",
    "@xcite likely overestimated the fluxes of fir 4 , since they integrated their derived continuum profiles at 350 , 450 , and 850 @xmath0 m out to @xmath2 20 , their derived envelope size .",
    "however , fir 4 seems to be surrounded by extended emission , and a 20  aperture will include emission from this surrounding material .",
    "their derived fluxes at 350 and 850 @xmath0 m are about an order of magnitude larger than our apex fluxes at similar wavelengths .",
    "@xcite also extracted iras fluxes at 60 and 100 @xmath0 m ; however , the iras beam is very large at these wavelengths , and contamination by fir 3 and fir 5 likely also plays a role .",
    "their extracted mips 24 @xmath0 m flux is also overestimated due to the aperture radius of 15 ; their flux value of 5.0 jy is 3.3 times larger than the value derived by @xcite with psf fitting .    the big discrepancy in flux measurements resulting from adopting apertures that are at most a factor of a few different suggests that the region around fir 4 is very complex and contains copious amounts of extended emission .",
    "the dust in this extended material is likely to be heated by the strong far - ir radiation field present in the orion cloud complex , and is not internally heated by the protostar itself .",
    "thus , if we want to characterize the protostar itself , it seems reasonable to adopt conservative ( i.e. , smaller ) aperture sizes to measure fluxes .",
    "the offset we found for the emission peak at @xmath10 @xmath9 70 @xmath0 m and @xmath10 @xmath11 160 @xmath0 m suggests that even our lowest flux values in the 160 - 870 @xmath0 m region could overestimate the envelope emission .",
    "this is supported by the interferometer results of @xcite , who found that there are multiple components in omc-2 fir 4 , only one of which contains a protostar .",
    "we therefore ignore the more extended core resolved in the observations of @xcite and @xcite and focus on the properties of the protostar and its inner ( @xmath41 8,000 au radius ) envelope .",
    "as shown in section [ mod ] , protostellar models that assume a dense , infalling envelope around a single protostar can describe the observed sed .",
    "we will discuss the relationship of this protostar to the more extended core in the fir 4 region in section [ clump ] .",
    "adopting an @xmath14 value of 37 @xmath1  for fir 4 , and using the beam fluxes at 350 and 870 @xmath0 m , we can calculate the ratio of sub - mm luminosity ( @xmath42 ) and @xmath14 . for @xmath42",
    ", we integrated the sed at wavelengths @xmath11 350 @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "we derived @xmath42/@xmath14 of 2% ( the result is the same if we add a long - wavelength extrapolation to the sed reaching to 10 mm ) .",
    "this value is four times larger than the minimum value for a class 0 protostar @xcite , so omc-2 fir 4 appears to be in a very early , evolutionary state , when presumably most of the stellar mass is still in the envelope or core surrounding the protostar .",
    "thus , it shares some of the properties of the pacs bright red sources ( pbrs ) discovered by @xcite , which are among the youngest protostars , with high envelope densities and infall rates .",
    "the log of the ratio of its 70 and 24 @xmath0 m flux in @xmath43 space amounts to 0.96 , while for pbrs this ratio is larger than 1.65 .",
    "nonetheless , our model fits ( section [ mod ] ) yielded high envelope densities , @xmath18 @xmath11 7.5 @xmath4 10@xmath27 g @xmath20 , very similar to those of the pbrs studied in @xcite .",
    "even model fits that at longer wavelengths only included the 70 @xmath0 m psf photometry point ( models 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 ) resulted in @xmath18 values close to 1.0 @xmath4 10@xmath23 g @xmath20 , suggesting that even if we assume that the far - ir and sub - mm emission is dominated by externally heated dust , the derived envelope density of fir 4 is still large .",
    "these models also yielded @xmath14 values of 12 - 14 @xmath1  for the protostar , which is less than half the smallest value measured from the observed sed , but is a result of these model fluxes being lower by almost a factor of 10 compared to the beam fluxes at 350 and 870 @xmath0 m and the flux from psf photometry at 160 @xmath0 m ( see figure [ hops108_sed_models ] ) .",
    "the ratios of sub - mm to bolometric luminosity for these models is 0.5 - 0.6% , on the low end for a class 0 object @xcite , but the @xmath15 values are @xmath9 60 k and thus clearly in the class 0 range @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is strong observational evidence that omc-2 fir 4 is a class 0 protostar .",
    "the high envelope density suggests that it is in an early evolutionary stage , and its sed classification as a class 0 object translates into a stage 0 physical state ( see * ? ? ?",
    "as shown in section [ mod ] , a wide range of models can fit the observed fluxes of omc-2 fir 4 , especially due to the somewhat uncertain source fluxes in the far - infrared and submillimeter and unconstrained model parameters such as the inclination angle and cavity shape .",
    "on the other hand , the current model fits can already give rough estimates for some source properties : the envelope density is relatively high , in the @xmath18 @xmath2 10@xmath23 @xmath6 10@xmath25 g @xmath20 ( or @xmath44 @xmath2 3 @xmath4 10@xmath26 @xmath6 3 @xmath4 10@xmath24 g @xmath20 ) range , and the cavity is either relatively narrow , combined with a more face - on orientation , or wide , if the inclination angle is high or a large amount of foreground extinction is present .",
    "when comparing our models 7 and 9 to the modeling results of @xcite , the envelope reference densities are similar , but our total luminosities and cavity opening angles are larger .",
    "even though all these models assume streamline - shaped cavities , @xcite used the sheet collapse solution for the envelope structure .",
    "this results in a wider region of decreased density along the rotation axis ( which is the same as the outflow axis ) compared to our tsc models , roughly corresponding to a wider cavity .",
    "thus , a sheet - collapse model with a smaller cavity still allows the escape of a large amount of mid - ir photons , even at higher inclination angles .",
    "our models require both higher total luminosities ( by up to a factor of @xmath2 20 ) and larger cavity opening angles ( by up to a factor of 6 ) to allow sufficient photons to reach the observer .",
    "inferring the total luminosity for fir 4 is more difficult . while the bolometric luminosity is derived from the observed sed ( assuming isotropic emission ) , the total luminosity is the intrinsic energy output from the object .",

    "they found that the centimeter luminosity is correlated with the momentum rate in the outflow ( @xmath52 ) , which is in turn correlated with @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting empirical relationship between the centimeter luminosity and @xmath14 for low- to intermediate - mass stars is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the cm flux in mjy and @xmath55 is the distance to the source in kpc ( g. anglada , private communication ) . using the flux densities in @xcite and adopting a distance of 420 pc , we find @xmath14 values of @xmath2 800 , 80 , and 190 @xmath1  for fir 3 , fir 4 , and sof 5 , respectively .",
    "thus , the radio continuum flux is most consistent with a @xmath56  @xmath1  luminosity for fir 4 , although there is considerable scatter and uncertainty in the relationship relating luminosity to centimeter flux .",
    "just based on its @xmath57 value of 0.11 , the centimeter emission from fir 4 is consistent with either a jet from a @xmath2 100 @xmath1  source ( shock ionization ) or an hii region from a @xmath5 10@xmath58 @xmath1  source ( photoionization ) ( see figure 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "our data and models are in favor of the lower luminosity for fir 4 , thus supporting the interpretation of the centimeter emission as originating in an outflow . given that @xmath59 @xcite , we can also estimate that the outflow of fir 4 has four times less momentum flux than the outflow driven by fir 3 ( 0.64 mjy for fir 4 vs.  2.48 mjy for fir 3 at 3.6 cm ) .",
    "alternatively , @xcite interpreted the centimeter emission as arising from photoionization from an embedded b3-b4 zams star , which would have a luminosity of 600 @xmath1  to 1000 @xmath1 .",
    "we do not favor this interpretation since there is no supporting evidence for photoionization ; the irs spectrum of the source does not detect the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features that are common in reflection nebulae around intermediate - luminosity stars .",
    "however , given the high extinction towards the source and the broad range of plausible luminosities for fir 4 , it is not currently possible to rule out this interpretation .",
    "additional evidence for an outflow comes from the far - ir co spectra .",
    "recently , _",
    "herschel _ spectroscopy with pacs has shown that fir 4 has the highest far - ir co luminosity in the sample of orion protostars studied by @xcite .",
    "the high - excitation , far - ir molecular line emission appears compact ( @xmath2 2000 au ) and centered on fir 4 .",
    "the excitation energies and critical densities of the transitions suggest that the far - ir co emission originates in hot ( t @xmath60 300 k ) gas , with fits to the far - ir co rotational excitation diagrams yielding temperatures exceeding 2000 k and relatively low densities of n(h@xmath13 ) @xmath7 @xmath61 @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "this hot gas is likely heated by shocks , possibly inside the outflow cavity or along cavity walls .",
    "@xcite detected broad wings in the far - infrared lines of oh , h@xmath13o , and co observed with _",
    "the line wings were symmetric and their widths and strength increased with the excitation level of the line , suggesting emitting gas that is hot or dense and thus possibly a compact outflow from fir 4 that contributes to the co emission . when combining their results with those of @xcite , @xcite derived a total co luminosity of @xmath2  0.4 @xmath1 . if we assume an @xmath14 value of 37 @xmath1 , the co luminosity amounts to 1% of the total energy output .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the protostar associated with fir 4 is responsible for the entire co emission . using interferometric observations , @xcite argued that the high velocity co emission toward fir 4 is due to the outflow from fir 3 colliding with the fir 4 clump . in their interpretation ,",
    "the morphology of the fir 4 core arises from the interaction with the fir 3 outflow ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", the far - ir co lines may have a significant contribution from the shock driven by fir 3 .      besides the offset between the 8 - 70 @xmath0 m peak and the peak at 4.5 @xmath0 m , figure [ hops108_positions ] also shows the offset between the 70 and 160 @xmath0 m peaks mentioned in section [ data ] .",
    "the 160 @xmath0 m peak also roughly coincides with the peak position in our apex data and those reported at 2 mm @xcite and 3.3 mm @xcite ( see also table [ fir4_positions ] ) .",
    "thus , the more extended emission at @xmath10 @xmath11 160 @xmath0 m probably probes a dense clump of dust and gas heated externally .",
    "this scenario is similar to the bok globule studied by @xcite containing a protostar and a starless core , with the emission from the latter source starting to be noticeable at @xmath10 @xmath60 100 @xmath0 m and becoming comparable to the emission from the protostar in the sub - mm .    to examine the properties of this molecular core",
    ", we integrated the flux in a 20  aperture centered on the core position , using an annulus from 30  to 40  to subtract out the more extended emission . for the core position",
    ", we used the average centroid position from the 160 , 350 and 870  @xmath0 m maps ( @xmath62 ( j2000 ) = 5@xmath63 35@xmath64 26.88@xmath65 and @xmath66 ( j2000 ) = -05   9  57.8 ) . after applying the aperture corrections for a point source ( which primarily account for flux scattered to large angles in the 160  @xmath0 m data ) , we fit a modified blackbody to the 160 - 870 @xmath0 m photometry using the same opacity law from @xcite as for the hops model grid and our models .",
    "the resulting fit gives a temperature of 22 k , a mass of 27.3  @xmath3 , and an overall luminosity of 137  @xmath1 .",
    "this is consistent with our earlier model that combined a protostellar model and a modified blackbody fit to our standard fluxes from aperture photometry ( with aperture radii @xmath7 20 ; thus , our earlier fit yielded a somewhat smaller temperature of 18.5 k ) .",
    "our analysis shows that the fir 4 core is massive with a mass commensurate with that of a high - mass star .",
    "although the possibility of higher temperatures due to the heating by the protostar may affect the measurement , the localized mass should be within a factor of two of the observed mass and therefore would still be in excess of 10  @xmath3 .",
    "our mass is consistent with the masses determined from the interferometer data by @xcite for a range of assumed temperatures .",
    "@xcite derived a core mass of 13 @xmath3  based on nh@xmath67 data ; they inferred that the fir 4 core was just massive enough to be in virial equilibrium and thus gravitationally bound .",
    "the placement of the protostar near the edge of the sub - mm clump is consistent with the claim of @xcite and @xcite that the sub - mm core has fragmented and is forming multiple objects , with the observed protostar to be the first object to form with a high enough luminosity to be detected .",
    "we also note that due to the large reservoir of gas mass associated with the protostar , although the observed protostar currently appears to have a modest luminosity , it may continue to grow in mass and luminosity as it draws from the core .",
    "hence , the final mass of the protostar , and whether it may form a low - mass star or intermediate - mass star , is highly uncertain .    given that the long - wavelength ( @xmath40 100 @xmath0 m ) emission from fir is dominated by the massive core that is mostly heated externally , the protostar itself is probably best described by our models that fit the mid - ir data and the psf photometry at 70 @xmath0 m and resulted in @xmath28 values ranging from 14 to 23 @xmath1  ( see section [ mod ] and table [ models ] ) . also , given the absence of a wide outflow from fir 4 , sed models that require a high total luminosity and large cavity opening angles seem more unrealistic .",
    "a young , spatially compact outflow would not have had sufficient time to carve a large cavity within the envelope . among the low - luminosity models ( models 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 ) , those with a larger inclination angle have wider cavities and somewhat larger @xmath28 values ( such that sufficient mid - infrared photons can still reach the observer despite the high inclination ) ,",
    "so we favor the two models with @xmath68 .",
    "in addition , the models with lower inclination angles ( which typically require larger envelope densities ) seem to result in deeper silicate absorption features and lower near - infrared fluxes , which better matches the observations .",
    "omc-2 fir 4 is an intriguing protostar whose nature has been debated in the literature ; it is likely deeply embedded and thus in an early evolutionary stage , but its properties , like luminosity and envelope mass , were poorly determined .",
    "we clearly detect protostellar emission at @xmath10 @xmath9 70 @xmath0 m , but at longer wavelengths the larger molecular core dominates the emission .",
    "we present the most complete analysis to date of this object . using data from the _ spitzer _ , _ herschel _ , and apex telescopes ,",
    "we derive new values for the bolometric luminosity of omc-2 fir 4 and estimate some of its envelope properties from model fits .",
    "some ambiguities on the detailed nature remain due to the deeply embedded state of the protostar .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    * we construct the sed of omc-2 fir 4 with photometry at 8 , 24 , 37.1 , 70 , 100 , 160 , 350 , and 870 @xmath0 m , and spectroscopy from 5 to 37 @xmath0 m .",
    "thus , the sed is well - sampled , in particular at wavelengths where the emission peaks .",
    "we obtain more accurate photometry of the protostar and its envelope by choosing smaller apertures ( @xmath2 10 ) in the 70 - 870 @xmath0 m range than were previously adopted .",
    "however , we note an offset of @xmath2  3  in the emission peak for @xmath10 @xmath9 70 @xmath0 m and @xmath10 @xmath11 160 @xmath0 m , which suggests that at long wavelengths we actually probe a clump of externally heated dust and thus even our fluxes at 160 , 350 , and 870 @xmath0 m could overestimate the envelope emission . * the bolometric luminosity of omc-2 fir 4 ranges from 37 @xmath1to 100 @xmath1 , depending on which values are adopted for the far - ir and sub - mm photometry .",
    "given that the extended emission surrounding this object at long wavelengths ( @xmath5 70 @xmath0 m ) may be dominated by a cold , externally heated clump , the @xmath14 value most closely describing the protostar is likely 37 @xmath1 .",
    "* models that include a protostar surrounded by a disk and envelope with outflow cavities fit the sed well .",
    "these models yield different best - fit parameters depending on which photometry values are adopted and which model assumptions are made . assuming a single protostar with an infalling envelope , we estimate that the envelope density is relatively high ( @xmath18 @xmath2 10@xmath23 @xmath6 10@xmath25 g @xmath20 or @xmath44 @xmath2 3 @xmath4 10@xmath26 @xmath6 3 @xmath4 10@xmath24 g @xmath20 ) , both for models with polynomial - shaped and streamline - shaped cavities .",
    "* the sed can also be fit by combining a protostellar model that considers fluxes between 8 and 70 @xmath0 m and a clump of externally heated dust that fits the longer - wavelength emission . in this model",
    "the luminosity is dominated by the clump , and the total luminosity of the protostar alone amounts to @xmath2 15 - 25 @xmath1  ( with corresponding @xmath14 values of 12 - 14 @xmath1 ) .",
    "the envelope density is still high ( @xmath18 close to 10@xmath23 or @xmath44 close to 3 @xmath4 10@xmath26 g @xmath20 ) , suggesting an early evolutionary state for the protostar ( stage 0 ) . given the significant contribution of the molecular clump to the long - wavelength emission , the protostar is probably best described by this model .",
    "* we find that the position of omc-2 fir 4 measured in our irac 4.5 @xmath0 m image is offset with respect to the position measured at 8 - 70 @xmath0 m , but matches that of the radio continuum source detected at 3.6 cm by @xcite .",
    "both can be interpreted as emission from shocked gas in an outflow .",
    "furthermore , there is evidence in favor of an outflow from far - ir spectra @xcite in the form of velocity profiles , temperatures , and densities derived from co lines , although they may contain a contribution from an outflow driven by the nearby protostar omc-2 fir  3 .",
    "these data support the idea that fir 4 is indeed a protostar , driving a compact outflow .",
    "in addition , the centimeter flux is consistent with that observed in outflows from other protostars with luminosities @xmath7 100 @xmath1  @xcite . * using fluxes measured in a 20  aperture centered on the clump position ( i.e. , the position of the peak flux at @xmath10 @xmath11 160 @xmath0 m ) and applying a modified blackbody fit , we estimate a temperature of 22 k and a mass of 27 @xmath3  for the clump .",
    "this clump could form more protostars , and omc-2 fir 4 , which lies near its edge , might be the first one formed , but is probably still growing in mass and luminosity .",
    "thus , we agree with the suggestion of @xcite and @xcite that the molecular core of omc-2 fir 4 likely fragmented , with one of these fragments currently containing a protostar . however , we find that the data is best explained by a @xmath7 100 @xmath1  protostar and not an intermediate - mass , luminous ( @xmath2 1000 @xmath1 ) young star as proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although the protostar currently has a modest luminosity , the final stellar mass it will obtain is difficult to predict considering that it is embedded in a core with a total mass of 27 @xmath3",
    ".    only long - wavelength observations at high spatial resolution , such as the vla and alma can provide , will allow us to better understand this object .",
    "in particular , mapping the dust continuum and the outflows at resolutions @xmath41 1  will constrain the envelope structure , including the properties of the cavity and inclination angle . this in turn will settle the question about this object s luminosity .",

    "only the models with @xmath69=5  agree well irrespective of cavity shape .",
    "this is also reflected in our modeling results from section [ mod ] , where the best - fit model parameters of model 4 ( which assumed a polynomial - shaped cavity and had @xmath69=5 ) are very similar to those of model 8 ( which assumed a streamline - shaped cavity and also had @xmath69=5 ) .    , calculated with the same parameters except for the cavity :",
    "in the five different panels , the same model is shown with five different cavity opening angles ( see label inside each panel ) , and in each panel for two different cavity shapes ( _ blue _ : polynomial - shaped cavity with exponent 1.5 ; _ orange _ : streamline - shaped cavity ) .",
    "note that model 4 has an inclination angle of 49 , and the best fit to hops 108 has @xmath69=5 .",
