    "<S> we explore the properties of atoms confined to the interstitial regions within a carbon nanotube bundle . </S>",
    "<S> we find that he and ne atoms are of ideal size for physisorption interactions , so that their binding energies are much greater there than on planar surfaces of any known material . </S>",
    "<S> hence high density phases exist at even small vapor pressure . </S>",
    "<S> there can result extraordinary anisotropic liquids or crystalline phases , depending on the magnitude of the corrugation within the interstitial channels .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers : 61.46.+w , 61.48.+c , 67.40 , 67.70    the bulk synthesis of carbon nanotubes has led to several investigations of molecular sorption within these tubes . tubes readily imbibe those materials with low liquid - vapor surface tensions@xcite , in agreement with a qualitative argument based on the ratio of the cohesive energy to the adhesive energy . </S>",
    "<S> one might expect , therefore , that inert gases would be strong absorbers within these tubes ; this belief was confirmed in both recent calculations and experiments@xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we explore adsorption in the linear interstitial channels ( ic s ) between close - packed nanotubes within a bundle or rope . </S>",
    "<S> small atoms , such as he and ne , fit well in these ic s . </S>",
    "<S> since this environment has a large number of nearby c atoms at an optimal distance , the binding is stronger than in any other known charge - neutral system .    </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pot ] 7.8 cm    the present paper describes our initial model calculations which establish this fact . after considering the energetics of individual atoms , </S>",
    "<S> we describe a variety of unique collective phenomena which may occur .    using the pairwise summation of atomic interactions with c , </S>",
    "<S> we have computed the potential energies of he and ne within the ic s ( which we assume to be infinitely long and perfect ) ; @xmath0 is the well depth of the pair potential ( @xmath1 k for he and @xmath2 k for ne ) . </S>",
    "<S> the study has been done as a function of separation @xmath3 between the axes of adjacent channels . </S>",

    "<S> 1 shows the resulting potential for the experimental separation @xcite , @xmath4   ( tube radius 6.9  ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 reveals that this value of @xmath3 provides nearly the greatest possible attraction for both ne and he atoms ; the potential on the ic axis is approximately a factor of two greater than the well depth within a tube of the same radius and is @xmath5150% greater than the well depth on a graphite surface . </S>",
    "<S> note that graphite provides the most attractive potential of any planar surface known . </S>",
    "<S> these comparisons imply that the uptake of these gases within the ic s ought to be significant and easily measured . </S>",
    "<S> we may compute the sorption using a variety of alternative models , several of which we discuss here .    </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gr_state ] 7.8 cm    one possible assumption is to neglect the corrugation of the potential along the @xmath6 axis , i.e. the axial direction of the ic s , and to angularly average the transverse potential . </S>",
    "<S> we then solve the single particle schrdinger equation in the cylindrically symmetric potential ; the potential and the lowest eigenfunction for he are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state energies for he and ne appear in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . for he , the computed binding energy at @xmath4   is a factor 2.3 greater than the experimental value ( 144 k ) on graphite @xcite . for ne , </S>",
    "<S> the analogous ratio is also 2.3 ( because the distance scale of the interaction is similar to that of he ) @xcite . in order to make quantitative predictions about the sorption in the ic s , we present here several simplified model calculations . </S>",
    "<S> a more thorough investigation is in progress . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the finding of significant sorption will not be affected by refinements of the calculations .    at sufficiently low density ( and </S>",
    "<S> not too low @xmath7 ) , we assume that the adsorbate is an ideal classical 1d gas ; hence , the resulting chemical potential satisfies @xmath8 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 is the 1d density within an ic , @xmath10 is the transverse ground state energy and @xmath11 is the de broglie thermal wavelength . from this relation and the analogous expression for the coexisting vapor ( of density @xmath12 and pressure @xmath13 ) , </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this relation implies for he that an extraordinarily low pressure , @xmath15 atm , yields a 1d gas with spacing 5   at @xmath16 k.    [ fig : eq_state ] 8.0 cm    one requires a pressure 20 orders of magnitude higher to achieve the same interparticle spacing on a graphite surface !    </S>",
    "<S> quantum and interaction effects enhance interest in this problem . </S>",
    "<S> hence we have addressed the extreme case of 1d he at @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> we have determined the equation of state of this system numerically , using the diffusion monte carlo method with the aziz interatomic potential @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig.3 shows our results . </S>",
    "<S> while such a 1d system undergoes no finite temperature transition , we have explored the effects of interactions between atoms in neighboring ic s . using a variational approach we have demonstrated the existence of a self - bound liquid at a density around 0.05 @xmath18 , with a binding energy per particle ( and transition temperature ) @xmath19 tens of mk . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that it is a remarkable superfluid without bose - einstein condensation ( as found also in 2d he at low @xmath7 @xcite ) .    from the data in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , we find that the chemical potential of the 1d system increases rapidly above a density 0.25 @xmath18 ( rising from @xmath550 k to over 300 k at 0.35 @xmath18 ) due to both zero - point energy and the repulsive interactions . at density @xmath20 0.25 @xmath18 , however , the net chemical potential , including the ic single particle energy @xmath21 , lies below the single particle chemical potential on graphite . hence we predict that a high density interstitial fluid would form at low @xmath22 in the ic s before any significant gas would adsorb on a graphite surface at low @xmath7 .    [ fig : energy ] 7.8 cm    we next examine the assumption that the atomic motion along the channels is that of a free particle . the corrugation of the potential on a graphite surface is known to be a @xmath515% effect , leading to band mass @xmath23 @xcite . in the very confined environment of the ic , the energy scale associated to corrugation </S>",
    "<S> is now magnified so that band structure effects are considerable . </S>",
    "<S> this problem merits a fully three dimensional calculation , which we have not yet performed . </S>",
    "<S> rather , we have solved a 2d schrdinger equation for a series of fixed positions @xmath6 along the ic axis ; the resulting eigenvalue @xmath21 becomes an input into a 1d band structure calculation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we observe in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 that this effective potential corresponds to a highly localized system . </S>",
    "<S> this property is manifested in the energy level and wave function shown , which are computed with a simplified harmonic approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the system of many atoms moving in such a potential has remarkable properties . </S>",
    "<S> the atoms may be so strongly localized that the system realizes the ( usually artificial ) lattice gas model . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state would then be a unique quantum crystal which can be characterized in a diffraction , thermodynamic , or nmr experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we shall report on its properties in a future publication .    </S>",
    "<S> the corrugations treated here are extrema within the available possibilities . </S>",
    "<S> uniform aligned tubes yield the maximum possible corrugation . </S>",
    "<S> we are currently evaluating alternative geometries to see whether the intriguing fluid , derived with the smooth potential model , may also be realized by appropriate choice of geometry .    </S>",
    "<S> we summarize our results as follows . </S>",
    "<S> calculations indicate that he and ne are well suited to squeeze into the interstitial channels between c nanotubes . the binding there is so strong that a high density fluid </S>",
    "<S> is reached at vapor pressures so low that negligible adsorption occurs on basal plane graphite . </S>",
    "<S> when cooperative effects between atoms in neighboring tubes are included , we find exotic anisotropic condensed phases to occur . </S>",
    "<S> these are being investigated currently . </S>"
