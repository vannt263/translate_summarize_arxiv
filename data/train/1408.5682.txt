    "the interest in asymptotic aspects of growing combinatorial objects has increased in recent years . in particular , the asymptotic spectral distribution of graphs has been studied from the quantum probabilistic point of view , see hora @xcite and hora and obata @xcite . moreover , as observed in accardi , a. ben ghorbal and obata @xcite , obata @xcite and accardi , lenczewski and salapata @xcite , the cartesian , star , rooted and free products of graphs correspond to natural independences in non - commutative probability , see @xcite .",
