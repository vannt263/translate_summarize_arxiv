    "it is known that in the standard model it is possible to introduce several definitions of heavy quarks masses .",
    "rather applicable at present are the potential subtracted masses @xmath2 @xcite , the @xmath3-scheme running masses @xmath4 and the scale - independent pole masses @xmath5 . the relations between these definitions of heavy quarks masses were studied in the number of theoretical works on the subject ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . since these masses are extracted at present from different rather precise experimental data , e.g. from the spectroscopy of heavy hadrons and from the measurable cross - sections of the productions of heavy quarks in different observable processes , it is important to know the relations between @xmath5 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 with high enough precision , which is gained by evaluation of high order perturbative corrections to the relations between pole and @xmath3-scheme running heavy quarks masses and to the qcd static potential as well .",
    "this talk is devoted to the summary of the available results of the determination of three - loop corrections to the qcd static potential and to the @xmath0 relations between different definitions of heavy quarks masses .",
    "special attention is paid to the discussions of theoretical errors in the existing numerical calculations of the @xmath0 contributions to the static potential @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and to the ratio of the running and pole heavy quark masses @xcite .",
    "the determination of the dependence of the this qcd correction on the number of lighter quarks flavours @xmath6 by means of the ordinary least squares ( ols ) mathematical method @xcite is described .",
    "the qcd static potential is strictly defined through the vacuum expectation value of the wilson loop @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a closed rectangular contour , t and @xmath9 are the time and three - dimensional space variables , @xmath10 is the path - ordering operator , @xmath11 is a gluon field and @xmath12 are the generators of lie algebra of the @xmath13 group .",
    "perturbation theory expression for the fourier transform @xmath14 of the static potential is known up to @xmath15-corrections : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the casimir operators and the qcd coupling constant @xmath19 is defined in the @xmath20-scheme .",
    "the coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ tildev ] ) were obtained by evaluating in the analytical form the corresponding one and two - loops feynman diagrams ( see @xcite,@xcite and @xcite , @xcite respectively ) .",
    "the additional term @xmath23 , correctly evaluated in @xcite , arises due to the infrared ( ir ) divergences , which begin to manifest themselves in the static potential at the three - loop level .",
    "however , in the concrete applications of the effective non - relativistic qcd these ir - divergent terms are cancelling out .",
    "the three - loop contribution @xmath24 to eq .",
    "( [ tildev ] ) can be presented as @xmath25 where @xmath6 are the number of quarks , which contribute to the qcd corrections to the static potential , responsible for the strong interactions of the heavy quark - antiquark pair with the flavour number @xmath26 .",
    "note , that the masses of all lighter quarks with the flavour number @xmath6 are usually neglected .",
    "the @xmath27 and @xmath28-dependent terms were evaluated analytically in @xcite and have the following form @xmath29 definite parts of the @xmath6-dependent coefficient @xmath30 and the overall expression for the constant term @xmath31 have not yet been computed analytically . the semi - analytical expression for @xmath32 was obtained in @xcite and reads : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the total symmetric tensors , @xmath36 are the generators of the adjoint representation of the lie algebra of the @xmath37 group .",
    "note that in the qed limit with @xmath18=0 the @xmath6-dependent terms , which are proportional to the powers of @xmath38 in ( [ a33 ] ) and ( [ a13 ] ) , are in agreement with the @xmath20-scheme three - loop corrections to the photon vacuum polarisation function in qed , presented previously in @xcite .",
    "the inaccuracy of the numerical evaluation of the @xmath39 coefficient was not indicated in @xcite , since it is much smaller than the uncertainty of the @xmath40 coefficient in the presented in ( [ a13 ] ) expression for the @xmath32-term .",
    "the most precise calculation for @xmath41 was made in @xcite .",
    "its result @xmath42 was published almost simultaneously with the following result of the independent calculation , performed in @xcite : @xmath43 using the same computer code one of the authors of @xcite improved recently the numerical precision of the second term in ( [ anzai ] ) , which now reads : @xmath44 within the error bars the results ( [ a03 ] ) , ( [ anzai ] ) and ( [ sumino ] ) have a common intersection region .",
    "the obtained in @xcite contributions to @xmath31 have the smallest uncertainties .",
    "however , it is highly desirable to understand what is the reason of the differences in the numerical results of ( [ a03 ] ) , ( [ anzai ] ) and ( [ sumino ] ) .",
    "indeed , in the process of calculations the authors of @xcite and @xcite used the same theoretical methods .",
    "let us mention the basic steps of these calculations .",
    "first , the diagrams , contributing to the 3-loop correction to static potential are generated .",
    "then they are reduced to about 2000 3-loop integrals . in @xcite",
    "these integrals were reduced to a relatively small number of the concrete master integrals using the integration - by - parts ( ibp ) method @xcite and the fire algorithm @xcite , which is based in part on the laporta algorithm @xcite .",
    "almost all master integrals were evaluated analytically apart of _ three _ of them , which were evaluated numerically . to check the results of these analytical and numerical calculations the program fiesta @xcite ,",
    "@xcite was used .",
    "the obtained in @xcite and @xcite numerical results in the expressions for @xmath41 and @xmath32 terms are related to the results of the numerical evaluation of _ three _ mentioned above master integrals .    in the independently made work @xcite the ibp method @xcite and the laporta algorithm were applied in the another way .",
    "to evaluate the master integrals the different from fiesta computer program , written by the authors of @xcite was used .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to relate the numerical uncertainties of the results , given in ( [ anzai ] ) and ( [ sumino ] ) with the ones , presented in ( [ a03 ] ) , which are determined by the numerical evaluation of the known _ three _ master integrals . in view of this",
    "it may be of real interest to consider the possibility of the detailed comparison of the fiesta computer program with the one , created by the authors of @xcite .",
    "note , that in @xcite using the maximal transcendentality hypothesis the guess on the analytical structure of _ four _ numerically known coefficients in the the expression for the @xmath45 correction to the static potential was made . more definitely , in @xcite we proposed to consider the reliability of the existence of the following decomposition @xmath46 where @xmath47 are still unknown rational numbers .",
    "one should note that the concrete coefficients @xmath47 in ( [ 1])-([4 ] ) may be zero .",
    "considering carefully the analytical results of @xcite in @xcite we expressed the hope that @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 may be really zero .",
    "the status of the discussed above hypothesis of @xcite will be clarified when the remaining numerically calculated in @xcite _ three _ master integrals will be evaluated analytically .",
    "the work on the solution of this calculation problem is now in progress .",
    "the information on the qcd static potential and on the uncertainties of its perturbative calculations are important in the definitions of the heavy quarks masses and their values .",
    "this is possible to understand after consideration of introduced in @xcite notion of heavy quark masses in the potential subtraction scheme .",
    "this definition is motivated by the studies of the behaviour of the cross - sections of the productions of heavy quarks near thresholds .",
    "it is based on the long - distance modifications of the perturbative static heavy quark potential @xmath52 , oriented on the suppression of the ir renormalon contributions ( for the consideration of the possible other power - suppressed non - perturbative contributions to the coulomb - like potential for heavy quarks , which are not related to the ir renormalon effects , see e.g. @xcite ) . in the static potential",
    "the ir effects can be eliminated by introducing boundary condition @xmath53 to its fourier transform , where the factorisation scale @xmath54 varies in the region @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the relative velocity of two heavy quarks , which is rather small near thresholds of their production .",
    "the equivalent way of the fixation of the factorisation scale is motivated by the uncertainty principle , which gives @xmath57 .",
    "the factorisation scale @xmath54 enter the definition of the subtracted potential @xmath58 as : @xmath59 the residual heavy quark mass @xmath60 is determined in the following way @xmath61 where the perturbative expression for @xmath62 is presented above in ( [ tildev ] ) .",
    "the defined by this way subtracted potential @xmath58 does not contain long - distance contributions . as a consequence , in the calculations of the cross sections of heavy quark production in the near threshold region the pole mass @xmath63 ( which contain long - distance ir renormalon contributions in its relation to the @xmath64-scheme running mass @xcite , @xcite ) should be changed to the potential subtracted quark mass @xmath65 , defined in @xcite as @xmath66 in the r.h.s . of ( [ mps ] ) the high loop perturbative corrections to @xmath60 , which generate ir renormalon contributions ,",
    "are cancelled exactly with long - distance contributions to the pole mass .",
    "using now the expansion of the pole mass through the @xmath64-scheme running mass @xmath67 and substituting it into ( [ mps ] ) one can eliminate the dependence on the factorisation scale @xmath54 and change it to the @xmath64-scheme running mass @xmath68 . to finalise this section",
    "we note that it is possible to obtain the link between the pole heavy quark mass and the @xmath69 running mass through the subtracted - potential mass .",
    "therefore the explicit expressions for the coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath30 in ( [ a3 ] ) can be related with the contributions to the @xmath70 coefficients in the the ratio of the running and pole heavy quark masses and may be used in future to check the results to be discussed in the next section .",
    "perturbative relation between pole and @xmath64 running heavy quark masses contains the discovered in @xcite , @xcite long - distance ir renormalon effects , which result from the asymptotic structure of the perturbative qcd series ( for discussions of the asymptotic behaviour of the perturbative series in the renormalised quantum field theory models see @xcite ) . however , to understand when the asymptotic nature of these expansions is starting to manifest itself and when the truncated perturbative series can be used it is necessary to study the concrete values of high - order corrections . to analyse these problems we consider the ratios of the defined in the @xmath64-scheme running heavy quark masses and the pole heavy quark masses , namely @xmath71 the coefficients",
    "@xmath72 can be expanded in powers of @xmath6 .",
    "all coefficients @xmath72 with @xmath73 were evaluated analytically in the case of @xmath13 colour gauge group .",
    "the one - loop correction was found in @xcite , the two - loop contribution was analytically evaluated in @xcite , the three - loop term is known from the analytical and semi - analytical calculations , performed in @xcite and @xcite correspondingly .",
    "the coefficient @xmath74 can be presented in the analogous to equation ( [ a3 ] ) form : @xmath75 the terms @xmath76 and @xmath77 are known in the analytical form from the calculations of @xcite . in the case of @xmath78 group of colour symmetry",
    "their expressions read : @xmath79 first two terms in ( [ zm4 ] ) are not yet known analytically .",
    "however , the overall numerical expressions for @xmath74 at fixed @xmath6 were calculated in @xcite with the help of computer program fiesta , created in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the obtained in @xcite results read : @xmath80 they were recently used by us in @xcite to get the numerical expressions for the analytically unknown terms @xmath81 and @xmath82 with the help of rigorous optimal least squares ( ols ) mathematical method .",
    "bellow we summarise definite steps of this work and discuss its main results . to get the values of _ two _ unknown parameters from the results of ( [ fixedn ] ) we use the following overdetermined system of _ three _ linear equations : @xmath83 to solve this system by means of the ols method the following function",
    "is introduced @xmath84 where @xmath85 are the squared deviations , @xmath86 labels the concrete equations in the system ( [ system ] ) and the expressions for @xmath87 are fixed by the numbers on the r.h.s . of each equation from this system .",
    "its solutions @xmath88 are determined by the following requirements : @xmath89 it is possible to show that their solution always exists and is unique due to the fact that the rank of the matrix , composed from the l.h.s .",
    "of the system , is equal to two and coincides with the number of unknowns parameters .",
    "this method allows to determine theoretical uncertainties of the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ fi ] ) of the parameters .",
    "theoretical errors were defined in @xcite as @xmath90 where @xmath91 are the given in @xcite uncertainties of the results of ( [ fixedn ] ) . using equations",
    "( [ fi ] ) , supplemented by ( [ errors ] ) , in @xcite we found the following expressions for two parameters we are interested in : @xmath92 similar expressions were also obtained in @xcite with the help of the _ fitting procedure _ of the numerical results of @xcite ( see eq .",
    "( [ fixedn ] ) ) , supplemented by the calculated in @xcite analytical expressions for @xmath76 and @xmath77 and by renormalon - based large @xmath93-representation of the @xmath6-dependence for @xmath74 , fixed in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this additional theoretical input was not used by us . however , our results from eq .",
    "( [ results ] ) agree very well with the numbers @xmath94 which follow from the ones obtained in @xcite for the @xmath70 contributions to the inverse ratio @xmath95 , where the running mass was normalised at another scale @xmath96 .",
    "the essential difference is that in @xcite theoretical errors of the outcomes of their fits were not analysed separately but fixed by the errors of the the numerical results , obtained in @xcite .",
    "in our work of @xcite we raised the question on the reason of the coincidence of the numerical errors in the presented in @xcite results of the numerical calculations of the @xmath70 corrections to the relations between running and pole heavy masses of @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99-quarks ( see eq .",
    "( [ fixedn ] ) .",
    "the proposed in @xcite explanation of the flavour - independence of the numerical error is that this error corresponds to the uncertainty of the @xmath6-independent contribution to ( [ zm4 ] ) , namely of the coefficient @xmath81 .",
    "if this explanation is correct , then the error of the numerical calculations of the coefficient @xmath82 should be negligibly small .",
    "therefore , the given in @xcite errors are not absolutely correct .",
    "indeed , they do not satisfy the proposed in @xcite explanation of the `` paradox of the coincidence of the numerical errors '' .",
    "the determined in @xcite ols method error of @xmath81-term really dominate over the uncertainty of @xmath82 ( see ( [ results ] ) ) and it is 3 times larger than the numerical error of this coefficient , which follows from the results of @xcite . in spite of this positive fact we understand that the errors obtained within the ols method may be overestimated ( in order to get more definite estimates it is necessary to have more than three equations ) .",
    "however , even these results indicate that it may be useful to clarify in more details how the numerical errors of the results of @xcite were obtained .",
    "this problem is really important .",
    "indeed , the difference in the numerical errors discussed above leads to different theoretical estimates of the uncertainties of the top - quark pole mass value ( in the case of applications of the results of @xcite this error is 0.005  @xmath100 , while if the results of @xcite are used the error is 4 times larger , namely 0.023  @xmath100 ) .",
    "the analytical evaluation of the coefficients @xmath81 and @xmath82 will remove this problem .",
    "it is highly desirable to get their analytical expressions .",
    "these calculations are realistic and already started in @xcite from the creation of the special computer program .",
