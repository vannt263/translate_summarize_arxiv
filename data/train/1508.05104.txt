    "an arm of the mzi is considered to be a one - dimensional superconducting transmission line guiding microwave photons from beamsplitter i to beamsplitter ii . accordingly , each arm ( @xmath12 ) of the mzi hosts a one - dimensional continuum of modes @xmath87 the mode operators @xmath88 and @xmath89 , obeying the commutation relations @xmath90=2\\pi \\delta_{jl } \\delta(k - k')$ ] , create and annihilate photon states from the vacuum in arm @xmath20 of the mzi . the wave number @xmath91 of a photon is related to its frequency @xmath92 by the linear dispersion relation @xmath93 . in our setup each transmission line ( arm of the mzi ) is intercepted by a microwave resonator enclosing a transmon qubit . for simplicity",
    "both cavities are characterized by a single mode described by operators @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the transmon qubit inside a cavity is dispersively coupled to the cavity mode .",
    "therefore we can describe each cavity - transmon subsystem by eq .",
    "( [ eq : qubit - cavity - hamiltonian ] ) of the main text .",
    "photons inside the cavity can leak into the transmission line and vice versa .",
    "this process is described by the coupling hamiltonian @xmath96\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 characterizes the degree of hybridization between the cavity and its environment .",
    "then , photons from the transmission line , which enter the cavity , interact with the qubit inside the cavity and are re - emitted into the transmission line .",
    "this scattering process is captured by the total hamiltonian @xmath98 far apart from the cavities for @xmath99 , photons in the transmission lines are considered to be freely propagating with respect to @xmath100 .",
    "this suggests the definition of the time - dependent input and output fields      where the operators @xmath102 and @xmath103 generate asymptotically free scattering states for @xmath104 . for simplicity we will omit the space",
    "coordinate in the following and consider only the point @xmath105 where the transmission line is connected to the cavity . as follows from standard input - output theory for cavities @xcite , the input and output fields in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : in - state ] ) and ( [ eq : out - state ] ) obey the boundary equation @xmath106 here @xmath107 is the time - dependent cavity operator which is subject to the heisenberg equations of motion      the formal solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : heisenberg1 ] ) @xmath109 can be iterated into eq .",
    "( [ eq : heisenberg2 ] ) . as a result ,",
    "one obtains the quantum langevin equation @xmath110 where the input field plays the role of an external driving . by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : input - output - boundary ] ) and the quantum langevin equation , one can derive the input - output relation @xmath111 where input and output fields are related to each other via the frequency - dependent reflection coefficient given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : reflection - coefficient ] ) .",
    "note that due to the lack of transmission into other channels than the reflection channel , the reflection coefficient is a complex number with modulus one , @xmath112 .",
    "furthermore , the complex phase of @xmath113 is the qubit state - dependent scattering phase that a photon acquires after being reflected from one of the two cavities .      in order to obtain a general expression for the fidelities",
    ", it has to be taken into account that photons usually are emitted as wave - packets .",
    "therefore it is convenient to introduce wave - packet operators @xmath114 that create single photons with a certain wave profile @xmath115 from the vacuum state in arm @xmath20 of the interferometer . to ensure that these wave - packets carry the intensity of one photon , the envelope function has to be normalized to one , @xmath116 .",
    "accordingly , the state of an incoming photon , which has been split by beamsplitter i , can be represented as @xmath117 after the photon has scattered with the qubits inside the mzi , the two modes @xmath118 and @xmath119 of arms a and b are converted into the output modes @xmath120 by the second beamsplitter ( ii ) to erase the which - path information of the photon .",
    "the phase shift @xmath121 arises due to the difference of the optical paths of the photon in the interferometer .",
    "then , by detecting the photon in one of the output modes c or d , the total wave function @xmath122 is projected onto one of the states @xmath123 in particular , the projected wave functions can be represented as      with normalization constants @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "all information about the shape of the photon wave - packet as well as the cavity detuning , i.e. , the differences between the two cavities is encoded into the linear coefficients which are given by @xmath127 here @xmath128 denotes the total distance , that has been taken by the photon from i through arm @xmath20 to the detectors : @xmath44 is the path length of arm @xmath20 and @xmath129 is the distance from ii to the detectors . from the general expressions ( [ eq : projected - states ] ) the ideal case is easily revcovered : if the photon frequency is emitted exactly at the sweet spot @xmath130 and if both cavities are identical , the projected states are equal to the favored bell states @xmath131 and @xmath132",
    ".    however , if these conditions for the ideal case can not be fulfilled , the projected state deviates from a maximally entangled state .",
    "this deviation can be quantified in terms of the fidelities of the measured states and the designated bell - state of the ideal case , @xmath133    = & \\frac{1}{2|n_\\phi| } |(f_{\\uparrow,\\text{a } } + f_{\\uparrow , \\text{b } } ) - ( f_{\\downarrow,\\text{a}}+ f_{\\downarrow,\\text{b } } ) |^2 , \\\\",

    "shall be discussed separately .",
    "to quantify the influence of a lorentzian - shaped wave packet , the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ eq : coefficients ] ) have to be evaluated for a lorentzian envelope function @xmath134 here it is assumed that the central frequency of the envelope function equals the sweet spot frequency @xmath135 in order to induce a @xmath38-phase shift , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : sweet - spot ] ) .",
    "since both cavities are considered to be equal in this case , the linear coefficients are symmetric with respect to exchange of the cavities , @xmath136 .",
    "therefore , we will omit the index @xmath20 in the following . then , the coefficients take two independent values @xmath137 and @xmath138 where @xmath55 is a complex factor",
    ". moreover , for a lorentzian wave - packet these coefficients @xmath137 , @xmath139 , and @xmath55 can be evaluated explicitly . in the limit of large cavity damping as compared to the photon line width @xmath140 , the @xmath55-factor becomes time - independent and reads @xmath141 -\\gamma/2+(-1)^\\nu \\kappa/2 }                      { i[\\omega_{c}+(-1)^\\nu\\chi-\\omega ] -\\gamma/2 + ( -1)^{\\nu-1 } \\kappa/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the difference between the optical path lengths has been set to zero , i.e. , @xmath61 . together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : eta - parameter ] ) the fidelities evaluate to @xmath133   & = \\frac{1+|\\eta(\\gamma)|^2 - 2|\\eta(\\gamma)|\\cos[\\varphi(\\gamma)]}{3 + 3|\\eta(\\gamma)|^2 + 2|\\eta(\\gamma)|\\cos[\\varphi(\\gamma ) ] } , \\label{eq : fidelity - gamma - phi}\\\\      f[\\psi^\\text{m},\\psi^- ] & = 1 \\label{eq : fidelity - gamma - psi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath142 $ ] denotes the frequency - averaged phase difference .",
    "as explained in the main text , the relative phase difference of states with even parity becomes zero @xmath143 , if the cavities are identical .",
    "furthermore , these states ( with equal phases difference ) interfere destructively at the second beamsplitter and therefore not transmitted into channel d ( parity - selective interference ) . only states with odd parity",
    "are transmitted into channel d and by registering the photon there , the wave function is projected onto the bell state with odd parity irrespective of the photon line width .",
    "microwave resonators , which are not identically fabricated , generally differ in their resonance frequencies , @xmath144 , their qubit couplings @xmath145 , and their cavity broadenings @xmath146 .",
    "consequently , for a photon , that is emitted at a single frequency , it is impossible to match the sweet spot frequency for both cavities simultaneously , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : sweet - spot ] ) . assuming that the photon is emitted at frequency @xmath71 ,",
    "the scattering - induced phase difference is exactly @xmath38 as indicated by the corresponding @xmath55-factor for cavity a , @xmath147 .",
    "however , since the photon frequency does not coincide with @xmath148 , the corresponding @xmath55-factor for cavity b is @xmath149 with @xmath150 . in addition , arising due to the detuning of the cavities , the complex factor @xmath151 can be defined in analogy to @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "since we neglect the influence of a finite line width of the photon here , all linear coefficients @xmath154 and their corresponding @xmath55-factors are complex phase factors with modulus one .",
    "one might expect that @xmath155 has an influence on the fidelity , but fortunately this phase shift can be compensated by appropriately adjusting the optical path lengths inside the mzi . by using ( [ eq : coefficients ] )",
    "we find @xmath156 hence , by properly tuning the angle @xmath79 of the interferometer , @xmath157 can be achieved .",

    "<S> furthermore , the usage of semi - classical radiation , involving signals with many photons , allows for the generation of multi - partite entanglement @xcite . in turn , the possibility of such multi - partite entanglement bears the risk of eavesdropping and therefore renders the ekert protocol for quantum key distribution insecure @xcite .    here </S>",

    "<S> the photon propagates through a mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) containing two transmon qubits to be entangled . </S>",
    "<S> relying on the discreteness of photonic fock states as well as the ability of cqed to access the strong coupling regime , our scheme prohibits eavesdropping during the entanglement generation as required for a secure key distribution . within the last decade </S>",

    "<S> the generation of single microwave photons in superconducting circuits @xcite and moreover the controlled creation of entanglement between microwave photons and transmon qubits has been reported @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these promising attempts towards well - controlled microwave photonics encouraged us to suggest an entanglement protocol taking advantage of the high efficiencies in cqed combined with single - shot ( projective ) measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> the outline of the paper is as follows . </S>",
    "<S> first , we will explain the generation of entanglement by introducing the interferometric apparatus and discuss the procedure under ideal conditions . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , a more general analysis clarifys the conditions under which maximal entanglement is achieveable . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we will discuss the case of entanglement generated by a lorentzian - shaped single - photon wave - packet as well as the entanglement in case of non - identical cavities .    </S>",
    "<S> at the first beamsplitter , an incoming photon is split into two partial waves @xmath0 , each traversing one arm ( a or b ) of the interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> after having passed the second beamsplitter , the partial waves are recombined and the photon escaped into one of the two output channels c and d , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ] . </S>",
    "<S> if both partial waves acquire a relative phase difference of @xmath1 while passing the mzi , i.e. , if both partial waves accumulate exactly the same phase in both arms a and b , the photon is transmitted into channel c with certainty . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if the partial waves accumulate a relative phase difference of @xmath2 , the photon is transmitted into mode d. due to this single - photon interference effect , the mzi distinguishes between certain qubit states : by placing two dispersively interacting transmon qubits a and b in each arm of the interferometer as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ] , each partial wave picks up an individual phase due to scattering from these distinct qubits . </S>",
    "<S> if the qubits are initialized in a state spanned by the subspace @xmath3 , @xmath4 , the scattering phases on are identical in both arms and the photon is transmitted into channel c. if on the other hand , the qubits are in a state spanned by @xmath5 , @xmath6 and if the scattering induces a relative phase difference of @xmath2 , then the photon is transmitted only into channel d. hence , the interference of the partial waves allows for a parity - selective transmission of the photon through the mzi , discriminating the states @xmath3 , @xmath4 with even parity from the states @xmath5 , @xmath6 with odd parity . as a consequence of this parity - selective single - photon interference , the mzi can be used to measure the qubit parity @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> once the photon is registered in one of the detectors c or d , the wave function collapses onto a state with definite parity , @xmath8 ( even parity ) or @xmath9 ( odd parity ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , such a parity measurement is useful for entanglement preparation like other solid - state implementations suggest @xcite , but here entanglement is accomplished with single - shot efficiency .    </S>",
    "<S> the protocol proceeds as follows : we initialize the qubits in the superposition @xmath10 with @xmath11 for each qubit @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this state is  among other possibilities  a suitable choice and due to the dispersive interaction @xmath13 each partial wave of the photon introduces state - dependent scattering phases @xmath14 and @xmath15 to the qubit : @xmath16 within each arm . </S>",
    "<S> crucially , we demand the phase difference to be @xmath17 in order to make the mzi parity - discriminating . </S>",
    "<S> note that such a large difference between the scattering phases can only be implemented within the strong coupling regime . </S>",
    "<S> after the photon is reflected off the cavities , it carries information about the qubit state as well as about the path it has taken . </S>",
    "<S> as this makes the states distinguishable we use the second beamsplitter ( ii ) to erase the which - path information of the photon . in terms of the output fock modes c and d the resulting state reads @xmath18 . recasting the final state in terms of the bell states    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19    reveals the parity - selectivity of the mzi and shows furthermore that , due to the missing which - path information , the parity measurement is not able to distinguish in which arm the photon has scattered . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the state projection leaves the qubits in an entangled state no matter in which detector the photon is registered . taking the measurement outcome as starting point </S>",
    "<S> , every other entangled two - qubit state can be prepared by means of single qubit gates . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> the protocol accomplishes deterministic entanglement with single - shot efficiency .    in the following </S>",

    "<S> the crucial part of the photon propagation is the scattering process with the cavities and the qubits inside of these . in order to describe the cavity - qubit subsystems , we assume for simplicity that each qubit @xmath20 is coupled to a single cavity mode with frequency @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the qubit states are separated by an energy splitting @xmath22 which is considered to be far detuned from the resonance frequencies of the cavities , @xmath23 . in this regime , the light - matter coupling gives rise to a qubit - state dependent renormalization of the cavity frequency  the dispersive shift @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , each cavity - qubit subsystem is then described by the hamiltonian @xmath25 where @xmath26 are creation and annihilation operators of the cavity modes obeying the canonical commutation relations @xmath27=\\delta_{jl}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> a photon @xmath28 , incident to arm @xmath20 of the mzi with wave number @xmath29 and frequency @xmath30 , induces a qubit - state dependent phase shift after being scattered off the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> this process is completely characterized by the reflection coefficient @xmath31 which relates incoming and outgoing modes of the mzi by @xmath32 @xcite . in ( [ eq : reflection - coefficient ] ) , @xmath33 denotes the spectral broadening of the cavities . due to the occurrence of the @xmath34 terms , </S>",
    "<S> the qubit states @xmath35 and @xmath36 accumulate the relative phase difference @xmath37 - \\arg [ r(\\omega_k;\\sigma_z=-1)]$ ] while the photon passes the interferometer . to achieve maximal entanglement between the qubits , it is crucial to generate a relative @xmath38 phase shift , i.e. , we would like to adjust the parameters of the device such that @xmath39 -\\arg\\left [ r(\\omega_k ; \\sigma_{z , j}=-1)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for both qubits a and b. condition ( [ eq : pi - phase ] ) can be fulfilled by tuning the photon frequency to be @xmath40 note that these frequency sweet spots do only exist in the strong coupling regime where @xmath41 . for convenience </S>",
    "<S> we will only consider one solution in ( [ eq : sweet - spot ] ) and omit the other one ; this particular choice will be of no importance for the following analysis as long as we consistently stick to it . </S>",
    "<S> recombining the two arms of the interferometer , the second beamsplitter acts as linear transformation upon the outgoing modes a , b and defines the output modes c , d via @xmath42 the phase shift @xmath43 keeps track of to the individual path lengths @xmath44 the photon has to take in each arm of the interferometer . as we will see later </S>",
    "<S> , this parameter turns out to be useful to prevent disturbing interferences that negatively affect the degree of entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> finally , after passing ii , the photon is absorbed by one of the detectors c and d thereby projecting the transmon qubits onto an entangled state .    </S>",
    "<S> however , several erroneous mechanisms may spoil the production of full entanglement and lead to limitations of our scheme : the shape of the photon wave - packet , the fine tuning of cavity parameters , dissipative photon propagation due to leaky cavities or imperfect circulators , and efficiency of microwave photon counters . since </S>",
    "<S> only the first two points one are inherent to the entanglement protocol , we want to focus our discussion on these intrinsic aspects . </S>",
    "<S> the latter points arise because of ( extrinsic ) technological limitations : if the circuit elements or the circulators are leaky , there is a finite probability for the photon to transmit into unwanted channels . </S>",
    "<S> this causes the reflection amplitude to have modulus less than one which lowers the photon count efficiency as well as the entanglement of the obtained state . </S>",
    "<S> the most serious experimental problem is the detection of single microwave photons . </S>",
    "<S> although technically already possible , it remains a challenging task to build microwave photon counters working at high efficiency , see @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , given the rapid progress in the field of cqed in the last decade , we are confident that the technological challenges will be addressed in the near future .    for a non - ideal setup , the photon measurement yields  depending on the outcome  projected states @xmath45 and @xmath46 that generally deviate from a bell state . </S>",
    "<S> in order to quantify the degree of entanglement , we determine the fidelity of the outcome after the measurement and the wanted bell state ; the fidelity is a measure of distance between states in hilbert space and is defined as @xmath47 = |\\langle \\psi |\\phi \\rangle|^2 $ ] for two arbitrary pure states @xmath48 and @xmath49 , see @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we are interested in the fidelities @xmath50 $ ] or @xmath51 $ ] , depending on the measurement outcome . if these quantities take the value one , the projected state is the sought - after bell state . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate how intrinsic errors affect the entanglement production and compute how the fidelity is affected by a single - photon wave - packet with lorentzian wave profile as well as for non - identical cavities .    </S>",
    "<S> generally , a single traveling photon is emitted as a wave - packet , i.e. , a superposition of various frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , it becomes impossible to fulfill ( [ eq : pi - phase ] ) for a generic photon state . </S>",
    "<S> for concreteness , we assume that the single microwave photon is produced from the controlled decay of a microwave resonator which means that the envelope function is a lorentzian wave - packet @xmath52 with spectral broadening @xmath53 and the mean frequency tuned to @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the relative weight factor @xmath55 between qubit states @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which is implied by the dispersive interaction , can be represented as a coherent sum over all frequency components in the wave - packet , see also the appendix . </S>",
    "<S> while the central frequency component of the photon wave - packet @xmath56 reveals a relative phase factor of @xmath57 , all other frequency components induce relative phase factors deviating from this value . by averaging coherently over all these contributions the resulting weight factor </S>",
    "<S> @xmath55 has modulus less than one , @xmath58 , and an average phase @xmath59 which generally differs from @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for the lorentzian wave - packet the fidelity is a function of the photon spectral width @xmath53 . assuming @xmath60 @xcite , @xmath61 , and focussing to the limit @xmath62 we find the fidelity @xmath63   & \\simeq     1- 2 \\big </S>",

    "<S> equation  ( [ eq : fidelity - gamma ] ) holds if the photon has been registered in the detector c. for the reciprocal measurement outcome we find , due to parity - selective interference amplitudes , @xmath51=1 $ ] irrespective of the line width , see the appendix for details . as @xmath64 approaches zero </S>",
    "<S> , the fidelity ( [ eq : fidelity - gamma ] ) becomes unity thereby achieving full , deterministic entanglement , i.e. , for any measurement outcome .    </S>",

    "<S> , the fidelity @xmath51 $ ] is shown as function of the spectral broadening in case a lorentzian - shaped photon wave - packet passing the mzi ( for @xmath65 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line is obtained numerically whereas the dashed line corresponds to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : fidelity - gamma ] ) ; both results agree in the regime @xmath66 . in ( b ) , the fidelity ( [ eq : fidelity - phi ] ) is shown as a function of the parameter @xmath67 , quantifying the detuning of cavity b , while assuming that cavity a is perfectly tuned . </S>",
    "<S> the ideal case corresponds to @xmath68 with fidelity @xmath69 . , scaledwidth=43.0% ]    moreover , in a realistic setup the cavities will always be fabricated slightly differently . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the frequency sweet spots of cavity a and b differ from each other , i.e. , @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that we can , at best , tune the ( central ) frequency of the photon to fulfill eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : pi - phase ] ) on one side , say @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> then , according to ( [ eq : sweet - spot ] ) the dispersive interaction induces a relative weight factor @xmath72 between states @xmath73 and @xmath74 of qubit a. since the other cavity can not fulfill ( [ eq : sweet - spot ] ) at the same time , it induces a distinct relative weight factor @xmath75 where @xmath67 is a function of the parameters @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 . by choosing the phase of the interferometer @xmath79 properly , @xmath67 remains the only parameter that can not be controlled in situ , see the appendix </S>",

    "<S> hence , the fidelity is @xmath85 & \\simeq   1- 3 \\big[1 - ( \\kappa/2\\chi)^2 \\big ] ( \\delta\\omega /\\kappa ) ^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equations  ( [ eq : fidelity - gamma ] ) and ( [ eq : fidelity - phi - approx ] ) suggest to tune the cavities in both cases such that @xmath33 is sufficiently large as compared to the photon line width and the cavity detuning . </S>",
    "<S> however , since eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : sweet - spot ] ) sets an upper limit @xmath86 for the magnitude of @xmath33 , the optimal implementation is a tradeoff between @xmath33 being larger than the photon line width and the cavity detuning , but still smaller than the dispersive shift .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have proposed a novel method to entangle distant transmon qubits by single - shot photon measurements . </S>",
    "<S> relying on the ability to access the strong coupling regime as well as the discrete nature of the fock state microwave photons , our scheme represents a parity meter based upon strong projective measurements as opposed to previous approaches involving weak continuous measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we have analyzed the entanglement protocol under non - ideal conditions by demonstrating the sensitivity of the entanglement in terms of the fidelity for a photon , emitted with a finite line width , as well as for inaccurate parameter fine tuning of the cavities . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have argued that for an optimal implementation the magnitude of the cavity broadenings have to be on an intermediate scale limited from above by the light - matter coupling strength . although the lack of high efficiency microwave photon counters remains a technological challenge for the entanglement protocol , we believe our method has potential applications for high - speed quantum communication protocols and rehabilitates a secure quantum key distribution for cqed implementations .    </S>",
