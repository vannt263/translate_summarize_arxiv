    "however , the use of rectangular grids makes an important limitation to the type of domain which can be gridded and more recently , finite volume schemes for the navier - stokes equations on triangular grids have been presented : see for example @xcite where the vorticity formulation is used and @xcite where primal variables are used with a chorin type projection method to ensure the divergence condition .",

    "@xcite , @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose the mathematical and numerical analysis of a discretization method which uses the primitive variables , that is the velocity and the pressure , both approximated by piecewise constant functions on the cells of a 2d or 3d mesh .",
    "we emphasize that the approximate velocities and pressures are colocated , and therefore , no dual grid is needed .",
    "the only requirement on the mesh is a geometrical assumption needed for the consistency of the approximate diffusion flux ( see @xcite and section for a precise definition of the admissible discretizations ) .    as far as we know , this work is a first proof of the convergence , of a finite volume scheme which is of large interest in industry . indeed , industrial cfd codes ( see e.g. @xcite ,",
    "@xcite ) use colocated cell centered finite volume schemes ; leaving aside implementation considerations , the principle of these schemes seems to differ from the present scheme only by the stabilization choice .",
    "the main reasons why this scheme is so popular in industry are :    * a colocated arrangement of the unknowns , * a very cheap assembling step , ( no numerical integration to perform ) * an easy coupling with other systems of equations .    the finite volume scheme studied here is based on three basic ingredients .",
    "first , a stabilization technique _",
    " la _ brezzi - pikranta @xcite is used to cope with the instability of colocated velocity / pressure approximation spaces .",
    "second , the discretization of the pressure gradient in the momentum balance equation is performed to ensure , by construction , that it is the transpose of the divergence term of the continuity constraint .",
    "finally , the contribution of the discrete nonlinear advection term to the kinetic energy balance vanishes for discrete divergence free velocity fields , as in the continuous case .",
    "these features appear to be essential in the proof of convergence .",
    "we are then able to prove the stability of the scheme and the convergence of discrete solutions towards a solution of the continuous problem when the size of the mesh tends to zero , for the steady linear case ( generalized stokes problem ) , the stationary and the transient navier - stokes equations , in 2d and 3d .",
    "our results are valid for general meshes , do not require any assumption on the regularity of the continuous solution nor , in the nonlinear case , any small data condition .",
    "we emphasize that the convergence of the fully discrete ( time and space ) approximation is proven here , using an original estimate on the time translates , which yields , combined with a classical estimate on the space translates , a sufficient relative compactness property .",
    "an error analysis is performed in the steady linear case , under regularity assumptions on the solution .",
    "an error bound of order 0.5 with respect to the step size is obtained in the discrete @xmath31 norm and the @xmath0 norm for respectively the velocity and the pressure .",
