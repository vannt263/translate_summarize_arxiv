    "casimir and related effects  @xcite may be thought of as observable results of the interplay between the geometrical properties of a certain spatial region @xmath0 , subject to some conditions imposed on its boundary @xmath1 , and the vacuum fluctuations ( inside and outside @xmath0 ) of a quantum field that experiences those boundary conditions .",
    "one of the best - known observable consequences of this interplay is the casimir force , whose properties depend on the details of the system considered , like the nature of the boundary conditions to be imposed , the number of spatial dimensions , and the kinematic properties of the vacuum field itself ( like its spin and internal space structure ) .",
    "a very special case occurs when the vacuum field is described by a noncommutative quantum field theory ( ncqft )  @xcite , since this single quality simultaneously affects all of the properties which observable effects may depend upon .",
    "indeed , a first , immediate fact , is that the spacetime structure where one should define @xmath0 and @xmath1 , is different to the one of a commutative theory , since the coordinates @xmath2 are noncommutative objects . in this respect , the most frequently considered situation corresponds to assuming that , in @xmath3 dimensions , the coordinates satisfy a relation that falls under the general form : @xmath4 \\;=\\ ; i \\ , \\theta_{\\mu\\nu } \\;\\ ; , \\;\\;\\;\\mu,\\,\\nu =      \\,0,\\,1,\\,\\ldots,\\,d\\ ; \\;\\;\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is a constant antisymmetric tensor . at the same time",
    ", the field is now an element in the noncommutative algebra generated by the coordinates ; thus , one should expect departures from the commutative case also coming from this ` kinematic ' aspect .",
    "it is our purpose in this paper to explore some of the distinctive characteristics of this kind of system , namely , ncqft with static , dirichlet - like boundary conditions .",
    "a very interesting phenomenological approach to this kind of problem has been applied , in  @xcite , to the casimir effect for two parallel plates in @xmath6 dimensions .",
    "we follow here a different path , where the boundary region appears from the very beginning , and the ( unavoidable ) ` fuzziness ' in the boundaries is automatically incorporated ( because of the noncommutativity ) into the formulation .",
    "besides , we attempt to make sense of a boundary with a rather arbitrary shape . in this aspect",
    ", we generalize the work presented by one of us in  @xcite",
    ".    we shall first deal with the formulation of the problem itself , since , as we just mentioned , one needs to make sense of the noncommutative analogue of geometrical regions , for example , @xmath7 , something that becomes problematic , because of the ` uncertainty principle ' which follows from ( [ eq : nccoord ] ) .",
    "an important ingredient in this study is the number of spacetime dimensions of the system considered .",
    "we are dealing with _",
    "static _ boundaries ; with this in mind , we shall study theories where just the spatial coordinates are noncommutative . as a bonus , we avoid muddling the discussion with problems due to time - like noncommutativity , which , although interesting , are not relevant to the kind of phenomenon we want to study here . with this caveat , and",
    "restricting our scope to @xmath8 , the most interesting case certainly corresponds to @xmath9 , namely , planar theories .",
    "indeed , if @xmath10 , the theory would be commutative and thus irrelevant to our study . on the other hand , when @xmath11 , only two spatial coordinates can be noncommutative",
    "indeed , in the equation satisfied by the spatial coordinates , @xmath12 \\;=\\ ; i \\ , \\theta_{jk } \\;\\ ; , \\;\\;\\;j,\\,k =      \\,1,\\,\\ldots,\\,d\\ ; \\;\\;\\;,\\ ] ] the antisymmetric tensor , being of odd order , has at least a zero eigenvalue ; i.e. , there is a commutative coordinate .",
    "thus , to make the geometry fully sensitive to noncommutativity , we shall consider a @xmath13 dimensional model .",
    "finally , there is also a phenomenological reason for this choice : this situation is realized , in exactly that way , when a strong constant magnetic field is applied to an essentially two - dimensional system .",
    "a projection to the lowest landau level then justifies a noncommutative description  @xcite . in this kind of planar model ,",
    "boundaries are known to play an important role , and one should indeed expect it to be so because those systems are the quantum version of incompressible fluids  @xcite .    from a practical standpoint , since the time coordinate remains commutative , the hamiltonian plays the role of generator of infinitesimal time translations in the usual way , hence many standard quantum field theory tools retain the usual interpretation they have in the commutative case .    the structure of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] we define the model and introduce our notation and conventions , in section  [ sec : boundary ] we study the boundary conditions and discuss their main properties . in  [ sec : self - dual ] , we deal with the case of models including a grosse - wulkenhaar term , at the self - dual point .",
    "section  [ sec : conc ] contains our conclusions .",
    "we shall be concerned with a complex noncommutative scalar field @xmath14 in @xmath13 dimensions , on which we shall define and impose ( the noncommutative version of ) dirichlet - like boundary conditions along a spatial curve @xmath15 ( see figure 1 ) , defined , for example , by its parametric form : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a real parameter .",
    "we shall use , throughout this paper , the convention that spatial coordinates shall be denoted by letters from the end of the roman alphabet ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ,  ) , so that the noncommutativity relations ( which , by assumption , affect just those coordinates ) may be written as follows : @xmath21 \\;=\\ ; i \\",

    ", we follow the approach of  @xcite , where dirichlet - like conditions are imposed by means of a specific interaction term which makes use of the noncommutative version of a @xmath25-like interaction term .",
    "this will ( as we shall see ) induce some special conditions for the fields on a ` fuzzy ' region determined by the curve , at the same time preserving the property of having the right commutative limit .",
    "the scalar field @xmath14 will be equipped with an euclidean action @xmath26 , a functional of the curve @xmath15 , the field @xmath14 and its adjoint @xmath27 , with the following structure : @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the action for a non - interacting field in the absence of borders , @xmath30 is a term which accounts for the boundary conditions , and @xmath31 corresponds to self - interactions .",
    "more explicitly , we shall assume for @xmath29 the form : @xmath32\\ ] ] while for @xmath30 , inspired by the commutative case , we consider two non - equivalent forms , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( both of which have the same @xmath35 limit ) : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the noncommutative analogue of the commutative two - dimensional @xmath38 function which has support on @xmath15 .",
    "the effect of adding each one of the boundary terms above plays , shall be elucidated at the end of next section .    in terms of the parametric form for @xmath39",
    ", the weyl mapping immediately yields : @xmath40\\ ] ] with @xmath41 .",
    "note that , in the expression above ( only ) @xmath42 and @xmath43 are noncommutative objects .",
    "it is worth noting that , to make sense of @xmath44 above one makes the implicit assumption that : @xmath45 \\;=\\ ; \\int \\frac{d^2k}{(2\\pi)^2 }      \\ , e^{i k \\cdot [ x - z(\\xi ) ] } \\;.\\ ] ] it will in some cases be useful to consider an alternative implicit representation of the curve .",
    "indeed , assuming that @xmath15 can also be described by the equation @xmath46 , the _ commutative _ version of @xmath37 can be written as follows : @xmath47 \\;.\\ ] ] this representation , except for some special cases , is not suitable for immediate translation to the noncommutative case , because of the possible noncommutativity between the two factors in ( [ eq : delta3 ] ) .",
    "special cases where that problem does not show up are : 1 ) a linear function , namely : @xmath48 , which corresponds to a straight line , and @xmath49 , which yields a radius @xmath50 circle . in the general case , @xmath51 may fail to commute with @xmath52 .",
    "however , except when the gradient vanishes on points belonging to @xmath15 , one can in principle find an alternative function , @xmath53 say , such that its gradient does have unit modulus on ( @xmath15 ) , yet defining the same curve .",
    "indeed , one may just define : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a function such that : @xmath56 for every @xmath57 .",
    "when @xmath58 , @xmath55 is smoothly extended quite arbitrarily , except for the condition of being positive .",
    "thus , whenever we use the implicit representation , we shall assume that it has been already ` normalized ' , such that : @xmath59\\ ] ] which can be unambiguously translated to its noncommutative version  .",
    "the implementation and meaning of the @xmath30 terms are discussed at length in the next section .",
    "finally , regarding the interaction term , we shall assume the two inequivalent possible ones that can be built out a ( globally invariant under @xmath60 transformations ) quartic monomial in the field and its adjoint : @xmath61 where @xmath62 \\nonumber\\\\ s_i^{(2 ) } & = & g^{(2 ) } \\ , \\int d\\tau d^2x \\",
    ", \\big[\\phi^\\dagger(\\tau , x ) \\star \\phi^\\dagger(\\tau , x ) \\star \\phi(\\tau , x ) \\star \\phi(\\tau , x ) \\big ] \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which correspond , respectively , to planar and nonplanar vertices in a perturbative expansion .",
    "we shall make use of the alternative ` operatorial ' representation for noncommutative actions , where the fields are not expanded apriori in any basis , since it is useful to prove some special properties . in that representation one has , for example : @xmath63 \\;,\\ ] ] ( where we have adopted , for the sake of simplicity , the convention to use the same symbol for a field in the moyal representation as in the operatorial version ) .",
    "we conclude this section by noting that _ except for the boundary terms _ the action is invariant under the discrete transformation @xmath64 , @xmath65 , which amounts to a kind of charge conjugation symmetry .",
    "some general properties can be deduced from the inclusion of the boundary interaction term , @xmath30 , as defined by a ` normalized ' function @xmath52 .",
    "it is quite clear that this term , in the commutative limit , yields dirichlet - like boundary conditions .",
    "it is our purpose here to see its effect in the noncommutative case .",
    "the intuitive idea that noncommutativity introduces some ` fuzziness ' into the game , and therefore the boundary conditions will affect the field on a finite - width region can be made more concrete .",
    "indeed , taking into account the relation exploited in  @xcite , we see that : @xmath66 with : @xmath67 .",
    "then , by expanding in powers of @xmath22 : @xmath68 , where the first term contains the purely commutative part , and : @xmath69 this means that , at least in an expansion in @xmath22 , the boundary condition shall involve not just the field value on the curve but also its values on points that are close to it .",
    "this will manifest in the existence of an effective width .    to understand the effect of this term ,",
    "it is convenient to go back , momentarily , to the operatorial representation of the action . in the @xmath34 case",
    ", we have : @xmath70 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath71 $ ] , and a similar expression for @xmath33 .",
    "to proceed , it is convenient to introduce a suitable representation ( a basis ) , for the fields , such that the @xmath25-function becomes diagonal .",
    "of course , that is tantamount to @xmath52 ( a self - adjoint operator ) itself being diagonal .",
    "there is a qualitative difference between two possible cases , according to the spectrum of that function being continuous or discrete .",
    "the reason is intimately linked to a geometrical property of the ( commutative ) curve @xmath15 : this curve is assumed to divide space into two ( ` inner ' and ` outer ' ) components : an @xmath52 with a continuous spectrum corresponds , in the commutative limit , to a case where the two regions are unbounded . a discrete one , on the other hand , amounts to cases where one of the regions has finite area .",
    "indeed , the commutative limit may be obtained by assuming that @xmath22 is very small in comparison with the area element .",
    "thus , regarding @xmath72 as the ` hamiltonian ' for a fictitious time evolution , one can obtain its eigenvalues in a bohr - sommerfeld like fashion .",
    "then the area becomes quantized ( discrete spectrum ) only for a curve that encircles a finite area .",
    "note that this remark yields a possible concrete way to construct the boundary conditions for a given curve : look for a ( one dimensional ) quantum mechanical hamiltonian such that , in the semiclassical limit , has a constant energy curve that coincides with the boundary one wants to consider .",
    "that hamiltonian , minus the corresponding energy , is essentially equal to @xmath52 .",
    "of course , one can always use the parametric representation instead .",
    "simple examples of the two kinds of spectra are : @xmath73 ( continuous spectrum ) and @xmath49 ( discrete spectrum ) .",
    "we shall discuss the effect of @xmath30 on the properties of the corresponding model for those two cases separately below .",
    "let @xmath74 be an orthonormal basis for @xmath75 : @xmath76 we then expand the field in this basis . using a shorthand notation for the integrals ,",
    "the expansion amounts to : latexmath:[\\[\\phi(\\tau ) = \\int_{\\epsilon,\\epsilon ' } \\ , \\phi_{\\epsilon,\\epsilon'}(\\tau ) \\ ,    \\;,\\;\\;\\ ; \\phi^\\dagger(\\tau ) = \\int_{\\epsilon,\\epsilon ' } \\ , \\phi^*_{\\epsilon',\\epsilon}(\\tau ) \\ ,    @xmath34 the following expression : @xmath78 ) limit imposes the condition : @xmath79 or , in terms of operators , @xmath80 ( and @xmath81  ) .    on the other hand , an analogous procedure for the @xmath33 term , yields : @xmath82 or , in terms of operators , @xmath83 ( and @xmath84 ) .",
    "the two boundary terms can also be written as , @xmath85      \\nonumber\\\\       s_b^{(l ) } & = & 2 \\pi \\theta \\ , \\lambda_l \\int d\\tau",
    "\\,{\\rm tr}\\big[\\phi(\\tau ) { \\mathcal p}_{\\mathcal c } \\phi^\\dagger(\\tau ) \\big ]      \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath86 .    to see this kind of constraint at work , we consider a concrete example of a continuous spectrum , or , as already explained , of an unbounded , open curve .",
    "the simplest possible case is a straight line : @xmath87 .    for the sake of concreteness",
    ", we consider the case of @xmath34 , since @xmath33 may be obtained by performing quite straightforward changes which we consider at the end of this section ( see below ) .    rather than using the operator formulation ,",
    "we go directly to the moyal representation , to see how it affects the plane - wave solutions one could obtain from considering just @xmath29 . in this situation",
    ", we have : @xmath88 which , by fourier transforming with respect to the translation invariant coordinates , @xmath23 and @xmath42 , adopts the form : @xmath89 thus , we find out the equations of motion that follow from considering just the action defined by @xmath90 , by performing the same fourier transformation on the @xmath29 term . in real - time : @xmath91 where we have introduced the kernel : @xmath92 and the mass - shell condition yields : @xmath93 , where we use the positive square - root , to consider a solution which corresponds to a plane wave incident from negative values of @xmath43 .",
    "this kind of solution is naturally treated as an scattering problem ; hence we may write the solution to this problem by means of the corresponding lippmann - schwinger ( l - s ) integral equation : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the ( incident ) free - particle wave , solution of @xmath96 and @xmath97 is the retarded green s function .    since we assume the free - particle solution to correspond to a wave incident from @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "besides , the retarded green s function satisfies : @xmath100 ( with retarded boundary conditions ) and may be written more explicitly as follows : @xmath101 to solve the l - s equation , we proceed in an entirely analogous way to the one presented in  @xcite , obtaining : @xmath102 where : @xmath103 . from the equation above we can extract , by considering the situations where @xmath104 and @xmath105 , the properties of the transmitted and reflected waves , respectively . in particular , one may study the dependence of the transmission and reflection coefficients on the incident momentum ; in this respect , we recall that the wave also has an @xmath42 dependence , which has been factored out of the solution ( since it is unaffected by the boundary condition ) . however",
    ", there remains a dependence on @xmath106 in the behaviour of the @xmath43-dependent part .",
    "for the transmitted wave , @xmath107 , and we have : @xmath108 \\ , e^ { i k_2 x_2 } \\;,\\ ] ] whenever @xmath109 , exactly as in the commutative case .",
    "in particular , there is no transmitted wave when @xmath110 and @xmath109 , since @xmath111 .",
    "note , however , that there is an important qualitative difference for points such that @xmath112 ( and @xmath113 ) .",
    "here we have instead : @xmath114 or , in the dirichlet limit : @xmath115 which is quite different to the previous case .",
    "in particular , the transmitted current is smaller than for @xmath109 , to the point of vanishing in the dirichlet limit .",
    "there is a reflected wave , and the system behaves as if there were a reflecting wall at @xmath116 , which only acts if @xmath117 ( we assume @xmath118 ) .",
    "the behaviour at @xmath105 is consistent with this picture . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath119 ( for the ` wall ' to act ) , we see that @xmath120 since , in this case , @xmath112 .",
    "we see that the outcome for the reflected wave corresponds to the same result as in the commutative case , except that ( due to the extra @xmath22-dependent phase ) it corresponds to a wall at @xmath121 , which introduces a spatial shift of twice that value , since the wave has to go forward and bounce back . finally , also for negative values of @xmath43 , if @xmath122 , which is nonempty for @xmath123 , we have : @xmath124\\ , e^ { i k_2 x_2 } \\;,\\ ] ] meaning that there is no reflected component : it only appears when @xmath125",
    ".    we may summarize all of the above by the statement that if we imagine sending a wave packet with a non vanishing momentum dispersion in the @xmath42 direction , the boundary behaves as it had a finite width @xmath126 . or , by a standard application of the usual uncertainty principle for @xmath127 and @xmath128 : @xmath129    in spite of this expected effect , note that , for a single wall one can impose dirichlet - like boundary conditions .",
    "the resulting reflection and transmission coefficients coincide with their commutative counterparts , but the wall will have an effective momentum ( @xmath106 ) dependent position .    as a consistency check on the previous derivation , we note that condition ( [ eq : dirichlet1 ] ) can be translated into the fourier transformed fields of the moyal representation as follows : @xmath130 ( in the same hybrid fourier representation we used above ) .",
    "this is of course equivalent to : @xmath131 as it should be .    a similar derivation for the @xmath33 term : @xmath132 after the same fourier transformation yields : @xmath133 which imposes , in the dirichlet limit , the condition : @xmath134 , @xmath135 .",
    "a simple extension of the single straight - line case is that of two parallel straight lines , at @xmath136 and @xmath137 . since the boundary has two disjoint components , one can consider different choices regarding the @xmath138 and @xmath50 boundary terms on each mirror",
    ".    in the @xmath139 case , the resulting boundary interaction term becomes : @xmath140    \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in particular , when @xmath110 , we find that @xmath141 has to satisfy the conditions @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "the solution is nontrivial if @xmath144 , exactly as in the commutative case .",
    "thus the casimir force coincides , in this case , with its commutative counterpart .",
    "the same happens when @xmath145 conditions are imposed .",
    "the situation changes , however , if one consideres a situation involving @xmath138 and @xmath50 terms .",
    "indeed , using @xmath50 conditions at @xmath137 and @xmath138 conditions at @xmath136 , in the dirichlet limit we obtain : the conditions @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "the modes are quantized , but now they satisfy : @xmath148 this is of course quite different from the previous case , since we see that , depending on @xmath106 , the @xmath149 allowed values correspond to an effective size @xmath150 .",
    "this is again consistent with the interpretation that the mirrors are ` displaced ' by a momentum - dependent amount . in the hybrid case ,",
    "the displacement is symmetrical about @xmath151 , thus it produces an observable effect ( unlike what happens in the @xmath139 and @xmath145 cases ) .",
    "note that the hybrid case is more symmetrical than those cases , since there is a parity symmetry , in the boundary interaction term , with respect to the middle point @xmath152 .",
    "the casimir energy per unit length @xmath153 ( i.e. , tension ) corresponding to this case is straightforwardly evaluated , the result being : @xmath154 \\;.\\ ] ] this tension tends to its proper commutative limit when @xmath155 .",
    "however , in the opposite ( short distance ) limit it grows faster than @xmath156 .",
    "we can calculate the free propagator ( corresponding to @xmath90 ) for the dirichlet limit : @xmath157 \\;. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , note that there is no impediment to include both kinds of boundary term at the same point .",
    "the result of this procedure amounts to , in the dirichlet limit , imposing @xmath158 , @xmath159 .",
    "the corresponding propagator , for the case of two mirrors at @xmath136 , may be obtained by setting @xmath160 above : @xmath161 \\;. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] besides , it is not difficult to see that when a wave packet insides on this kind of mirror , there is an effective ` widening ' ( depending on @xmath106 ) as a result of the emergence momentum dependent boundary condition to the left and right of @xmath136 . note that , imposing both conditions yields a more symmetrical situation , in the sense that the system is even under parity and under charge conjugation : @xmath64 , @xmath162 .",
    "if one rederives the allowed spectra for two of these mirrors , one finds again ( [ eq : k2 ] ) , plus a condition on @xmath106 : @xmath163 where @xmath164 is an arbitrary rational number .      in this case , we use instead a discrete basis @xmath165 : @xmath166 expanding the field in this basis : latexmath:[\\[\\phi(\\tau ) = \\sum_{nm } \\ , \\phi_{nm}(\\tau ) |n \\rangle \\langle m|   \\;,\\;\\;\\ ; \\phi^\\dagger(\\tau ) = \\sum_{nm } \\ , \\phi^*_{mn}(\\tau ) \\ ,    case , getting a non - vanishing result that moreover is similar to the continuous case , we use , in this case , a kronecker @xmath25 ( rather that a dirac one ) such that : @xmath168 ) limit imposes the condition @xmath169 so we take this kind of condition as the starting point of our derivation in the discrete spectrum .",
    "note that , in order for the condition on the field to be non - empty , one should make sure that @xmath170 belongs to the spectrum of @xmath75 .",
    "besides , the normalization of the @xmath25 function loses its meaning here since one has a sum rather than integral .",
    "it is quite natural to use , as the analogue continuous case , the following : @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the orthogonal projector on the null space of the operator @xmath52 . in the notation",
    "used above : @xmath173 .",
    "the example we shall produce for this case will be the one of a circle of radious @xmath50 , with @xmath174 .",
    "since @xmath175 = i \\theta$ ] , one introduces and .",
    "then : @xmath176    besides , @xmath50 is chosen in order to ensure @xmath170 belong to the spectrum of @xmath52 .",
    "thus : @xmath177 as in the continuous case , one can impose both @xmath50 and @xmath138 conditions simultaneously .",
    "we have , in the previous cases , expanded the operators in a basis which diagonalizes the @xmath25-function ; in other words , a basis which is consistent with the symmetries that survive the imposition of the boundary conditions . a particularly interesting case arises when the same basis also diagonalizes the @xmath29 term , since in such a case the free propagator ( and , as a by - product , the energies ) can be exactly found . however , the only two known cases in which @xmath29 can be exactly diagonalized correspond to free fields or to a field in the presence of a ` critical magnetic field ' , which renders the model self - dual under the langmann - szabo duality  @xcite , or to the presence of grosse - wulkenhaar  @xcite confining potentials .",
    "the basis which renders the propagator diagonal is the so - called ` matrix base ' , and corresponds to harmonic oscillator like states created by .",
    "thus , the only non - trivial case where the two symmetries agree , correspond to the circular boundaries , whose radii are determined by the discrete eigenvalue of the number operator @xmath178 .",
    "they are considered in the following section .",
    "we have seen that the only system where one can find a basis that simultaneously diagonalizes @xmath29 and @xmath30 consists of a langmann - szabo self - dual action and a circular boundary . to construct self - dual models one can introduce a coupling between @xmath14 and a critical magnetic field , or to use a grosse - wulkenhaar confining potential term . in the former ,",
    "one uses one of two constant magnetic fields , @xmath179 and @xmath180 , corresponding to fundamental and anti - fundamental @xmath181 gauge transformation properties , respectively .",
    "the covariant derivatives act on @xmath14 as follows : @xmath182 with @xmath183 , and @xmath184 .",

    "we see here that the there is a natural choice of boundary term : it has to be the sum of @xmath50 and @xmath138 , with identical coupling constants .",
    "we then write , in the matrix base , the @xmath30 action @xmath191 for this choice , with @xmath192 denoting the state corresponding to the radius of @xmath15 : @xmath193 the propagator ( in frequency space ) can be found exactly : @xmath194 in the dirichlet limit , one can simply solve the resulting constraints , by restricting the fields to be of the form : @xmath195 may be reinterpreted as having consistently eliminated one of the basis elements , @xmath196 .    by the same token ,",
    "the casimir energy in this case is just the vacuum energy for the @xmath197 field mode .",
    "this object has the same action as a single oscillator , thus its vacuum energy is : @xmath198 . in terms of @xmath50",
    ", this corresponds to a tension : @xmath199",
    "we have studied different ways to impose boundary conditions on a noncommutative qft .",
    "we have seen that , for the case of a complex field , there are in principle two inequivalent terms which , however , have the same commutative limit .",
    "those terms introduce qualitatively different boundary conditions , and respect different symmetries .",
    "we have shown that they may be interpreted producing ( under certain circumstances ) a ` widening ' of the curve , such that that effect is compatible with the uncertainty principle for the coordinates .",
    "we also considered self - dual models , showing that in the most symmetrical situation , imposing dirichlet conditions is equivalent to discarding one of the elements from the matrix base .",
    "namely , to reducing the space of field configurations . that reduction can be consistently implemented even when there are interactions , something that does not happen in for non - symmetric boundary terms .",
