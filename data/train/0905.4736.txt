    "the distribution of matter around a black hole ( bh ) is inevitably affected by its formation and evolution , both in the case of baryons @xcite and dark matter ( dm ) @xcite .",
    "the physics is relatively simple : when a compact object forms , the surrounding matter reacts to the increased gravitational potential , and if the growth proceeds on a timescale much longer than the dynamical time of the system , large overdensities can be achieved .",
    "this is particularly important for the dm distribution , because the dm annihilation rate is proportional to the square of the number density of dm particles .",
    "this means that if bh formation increases the dm density locally , it also boosts the annihilation rate and improves the prospects for detecting dm through the observation of secondary particles such as gamma - rays , anti - matter and neutrinos .",
    "gondolo and silk have applied this argument to the distribution of dm at the center of the galaxy @xcite , where a supermassive bh ( smbh ) of 24 @xmath0 is known to dominate the gravitational potential within a sphere of radius @xmath1  pc .",
    "the consequent enhancement in the dm density around the central smbh ( dubbed a _ spike _ ) was subsequently shown likely to be reduced by major merger events , off - center formation of the seed bh , gravitational scattering off stars and dm annihilations @xcite .",
    "zhao and silk have subsequently suggested that mild overdensities of dm could also be present around intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) , remnants of pop iii stars , and provided the first rough estimates of the properties of _ mini - spikes _ surrounding imbhs in the milky way @xcite .",
    "bertone , zentner and silk ( hereafter bzs ) built a consistent formation and evolution scenario for imbhs and associated mini - spikes , for two different classes of models : `` mild '' mini - spikes around imbhs remnants of pop iii stars , and `` strong '' mini - spikes , around more massive compact objects @xcite .",
    "for both scenarios , bzs tracked the merger history of each individual bh , and selected precisely those imbhs which never experienced mergers , to ensure at a minimum that major mergers have not destroyed any spike that may have existed around the original bh .",
    "this has allowed a detailed quantitative description of the mini - spikes scenario , and practically all subsequent studies published in the literature have made use directly or indirectly of the bzs imbh models . moreover ,",
    "bzs were able to predict some of the demographics of wandering imbhs , that may not be directly associated with the milky way bulge or disk , and they proposed to search for a class of gamma - rays objects sharing the same energy spectrum as a smoking - gun signature of dm annihilations .    here , we review the formation scenarios and the physics behind the bzs imbh models , and explore how the population of imbhs , thus of mini - spikes , depends on cosmological , astrophysical and particle physics parameters .",
    "to this aim , we update the original bzs catalogs , including the most recent determination of cosmological parameters , and explore the dependence on astrophysical quantities .",
    "we also review here the experimental strategies that may allow the detection of mini - spikes , including the observation of multiple gamma - ray and neutrino sources in the milky way , a collection of gamma - ray sources around m31 , and the possible contribution to the absolute flux and the angular power spectrum of the extra - galactic gamma - ray background ( egb ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : formation_scenarios ] , we review the imbhs formation scenarios and discuss the current population of imbhs in the milky way . in section [ sec : adiabation_contraction ] we discuss adiabatic contraction and the formation of mini - spikes .",
    "section [ sec : galactic_imbhs ] is dedicated to the prospects for detecting dm through gamma - rays and neutrinos from imbhs in our galaxy and in m31 . in section [ sec : angular_spectrum ] we discuss the impact of the mini - spikes population on the extra - galactic gamma - ray background . in the final section ( section [ sec : discussion_conclusions ] )",
    "we discuss our results and present our conclusions .",
    "we refer to bhs with masses within a relatively large range , @xmath2 as intermediate mass black holes .",
    "the lower limit is roughly the mass of the largest bh that can be produced by stellar collapse @xcite , and the upper limit corresponds to the minimum mass for a smbh .",
    "there is not a clear experimental evidence for this class of objects , but they are often invoked as an explanation of ultra luminous x - ray sources , i.e. sources that emit at a luminosity larger than @xmath3 , thus exceeding the eddington luminosity of stellar bhs @xcite .",
    "imbhs may also be hosted inside globular clusters @xcite .",
    "a hint in favor of this possibility comes from the fact that the predicted masses for the imbhs and the velocity dispersion typical of a globular cluster follow exactly the extrapolation at lower values of the @xmath4 relation valid for smbhs @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", imbhs may provide massive enough seeds for the growth of high - redshift smbhs , as observed by the sloan digital sky survey in the form of quasars at redshifts as high as @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "conclusive evidence for imbhs may come in the near future from the detection ( e.g. by lisa @xcite ) of the gravitational waves emitted in the mergers of imbhs @xcite .      in bzs , two formation scenarios for imbhs have been studied , and we refer to that paper for a detailed discussion . in the first scenario ( scenario a )",
    "imbhs are remnants of the collapse of population iii stars @xcite . since the jeans mass scales with the temperature as @xmath6",
    ", the mass of pop iii stars ( which form early in a hot environment ) is expected to be higher than other stars , around @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "newtonian simulations suggest that the evolution of pop  iii stars is very different from stars in the local universe .",
    "zero metallicity pop  iii stars evolve on a timescale of order @xmath8  myr .",
    "if their masses are in the range @xmath9 and @xmath10 , they collapse directly to bhs , while if @xmath11 , they are completely disrupted due to the pulsation - pair - production instability , leaving behind no remnant @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    the second formation scenario ( scenario b ) considered by bzs was based on ref.@xcite , as an example of models in which the collapse of primordial gas in early - forming halos leads to the `` direct '' formation of very massive objects @xcite . in this specific scenario , the baryons in the low tail of the angular momentum distribution form a pressure - supported disc at the center of the halo .",
    "gravitational instabilities then turn on an effective viscosity that make baryons lose their angular momentum , causing an inward mass flow .",
    "the process comes to an end after @xmath12 , when the first stars form or when the halo experiences a major merger @xcite .",
    "the central object will then undergo gravitational collapse producing the final bh .",
    "the requirement that loss of angular momentum via viscosity is effective , fixes a mass scale of @xmath13 for the initial halos , and leads to a mass scale for the final imbhs of order @xmath14 .",
    "in fact , the mass distribution for scenario b turns out to be a log - normal gaussian ( @xmath15 ) with a mean value @xmath16 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the virial mass of the halo , @xmath19 the redshift of formation , @xmath20 the fraction of the baryonic mass of the halo that goes into the central pressure - supported disc , @xmath21 the fraction of the mass of the disc that ends up in the final imbh and @xmath22 is the timescale available for angular momentum transfer due to the effective viscosity .",
    "bzs have estimated the population of imbhs in the mw in scenario a as follows : they populated all the halos at @xmath23 that constitute a @xmath24 peak ( with respect to the average density ) with a pristine imbh of mass @xmath25 .",
    "the evolution of the halos is then simulated as in refs .",
    "@xcite , a procedure that tracks the growth and mergers of the structures down to redshift zero .",
    "the imbhs in the halos that never experience mergers survive until the present epoch and constitute the current population of scenario a imbhs .",
    "their mass is assumed to remain unchanged with respect to the initial value @xmath26 , and the number of unmerged imbhs was found to be @xmath27 .    in the case of scenario",
    "b , bzs have followed a similar approach for the evolution of imbhs , with the difference that only those halos with a mass larger than the mass threshold @xmath28 for the onset of the effective viscosity ( see the discussion above ) are populated with imbhs , with a mass function as in eq .",
    "[ massfunc ] ( see also fig . [",
    "fig : mass_spectrum ] ) .",
    "the predicted number of imbhs in the mw for scenario b was @xmath29 @xcite ( see below for more recent results obtained with updated cosmological parameters ) .",
    "each of these models of high - redshift seed bh formation is reasonable , but both of these scenarios remain uncertain in their detail . in particular , these models exhibit parameters that may reasonably take on a wide range of values leading to markedly different predictions for imbh demographics at @xmath30 .",
    "the formation of seed bhs in both scenarios is cut off at redshifts when significant small - scale fragmentation of baryonic disks sets in and bh formation in scenario b terminates absolutely when the universe becomes significantly reionized . in what follows",
    "we exhibit the significant parameter freedom within these models by varying the formation redshift in scenario a , and the reionization redshift in scenario b among viable and illustrative values . in scenario",
    "a , lowering the formation redshift requires that the seed black holes generally form in halos of higher mass , leading to reduced abundance , while in scenario b lowering the redshift of reionization allows angular momentum loss to be effective for a longer period , increasing the number of seed black holes .",
    "we note here that the range of parameters we choose are currently viable and refer the reader to bzs for modeling details .",
    "the radial distribution of imbhs was found to be steeper than a navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile @xcite ( see the right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : mass_spectrum ] ) , and it is well fitted by the following analytical function @xcite : @xmath31^{-10.8 } \\mbox{kpc}^{-3}.\\ ] ]",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , imbhs and smbhs are particularly interesting for indirect dm searches , because they may act as _ annihilation boosters _ , as their growth can lead to large dm overdensities that enhance annihilation fluxes ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "in particular , if the crossing timescale @xmath32 ( the time needed for a dm particle to cross the central part of the halo ) is much smaller than the bh growth timescale @xmath33 , dm particles conserve their angular momenta and their radial actions ( the integral of the radial velocity over one closed orbit ) , and move to orbits which are closer to the bh , thus enhancing their number density and annihilation rate .",
    "the first study of adiabatic contraction was performed by young in 1980 @xcite in the context of stellar systems . in subsequent studies",
    "also dm has been taken into account @xcite and two different situations have usually been considered :    * `` analytical cores '' , in which case the initial dm profile can be taylor - expanded around the bh as : @xmath34 , * @xmath35-models , in which the inner initial dm profile is a power - law , @xmath36 .",
    "the result of the adiabatic contraction is different in the two cases . a strong density enhancement , or _",
    "spike _ , is produced in both cases , but the final slope is steeper for @xmath35-models .",
    "the difference is due to the different behavior of the phase - space distribution function @xmath37 . in the case of @xmath35-models",
    ", @xmath20 diverges in the limit @xmath38 , meaning that cold orbits ( those orbits populated by particles with very low velocities ) have a large occupation number .",
    "the final dm profile for a @xmath35-model is a new power - law @xmath39 with a steeper slope .",
    "the value of @xmath40 depends on the initial slope as in the following equation : @xmath41    the effect of smbh growth at the galactic center on dm density profiles is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spike ] for an initial nfw profile ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the final profile in this case is a power - law of index @xmath43 within a region of radius @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the radius that encloses a dm mass equal to twice the mass of the central bh .",
    "there is an upper limit to the dm density that can be achieved around the smbh ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spike ] ) .",
    "in fact , the power - law solution is valid only down to a radius equal to the last stable orbit around the smbh and , furthermore , dm annihilation itself sets an upper limit on the dm density of order @xmath46 , so that the density is saturated at a cut - off radius of @xmath47 , \\ ] ]    where @xmath48 is the schwarzschild radius of the imbh @xmath49 .    any spike forming at the center of a galactic halo would inevitably be affected by dynamical processes that tend to deplete the dm density @xcite .",
    "for instance , a merger between two halos , the interaction with a globular cluster or the presence of a bar are all able to disrupt the distribution of the cold particles that constitute the spike , efficiently damping the enhancement @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the bh may not form exactly at the center of the dm distribution @xcite , in which case the orbits that the bh crosses in its spiraling in will be depleted and the final enhancement will be much shallower than depicted in fig . [",
    "fig : spike ] .",
    "finally , one should also take into account the interactions of the dm particles with baryons @xcite : transferring energy to the dm particles , the effect is , as before , of heating the dm so that the particles in the spike will be able to leave the central region . when also including the effect of dm annihilations , it is possible to show that any dm overdensity around a bh at the center of a galactic halo can hardly survive until today @xcite , although interactions of baryons can actually lead to the re - growth of mild overdensities known as dm _ crests _ @xcite .",
    "our approach is to account for some of these mitigating factors by considering only those bhs that formed at high redshift and were found never to interact with any other bh during the hierarchical merging process , as discussed in ref .",
    "moreover , at least for scenario b , off - center formation is not possible for imbhs and interactions of dm with baryons have only minor effects , so that , in contrast to smbhs , imbhs can effectively retain their mini - spike .",
    "the flux of secondary particles produced by dm annihilation around an imbh can be written as @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the thermally - averaged annihilation cross section , @xmath52 is the mass of the dm particle and @xmath53 is the number of secondary particles produced per annihilation .",

    "indeed the prospects for detecting such objects with fermi and air cherenkov telescopes are encouraging . a spectacular signature for a dm signal may come from the detection of a class of gamma - ray point sources that are not associated with astrophysical sources and that share the same energy spectrum .",
    "imbhs may also be detected through neutrinos or they can produce a sizable excess in antimatter cosmic - ray fluxes , as studied in ref .",
    "moreover , analogous populations of imbhs should be present in other galaxies , such as the nearby andromeda galaxy and several gamma - ray sources could be detectable .    in general , the gamma - ray fluxes from imbhs in all dm halos at all redshifts produce a diffuse gamma - ray background that for the most optimistic scenario b can explain a large fraction of the observed egb .",
    "this opens the interesting possibility to detect dm annihilations in the extra - galactic background .",
    "the best strategy would be to analyze not only the egb energy spectrum but also the angular correlations of the emission .",
    "in fact , the egb angular power spectrum could provide a robust method to distinguish the dm signal from conventional astrophysical emission .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors derived constraints on the mini - spike scenario from a comparison of predictions based on bzs models with egret data .",
    "these authors claim that they rule out the possibility to detect the products of dm annihilation in mini - spikes . despite the bold claim , their analysis only rules out a specific combination of cosmological and astrophysical parameters , for only one ( out of many ) possible formation scenarios",
    "actually , we showed above that by simply adopting the wmap 5-year cosmological parameters , the expected number of objects went down by a factor of 2 , and that changing the redshift of formation in scenario a , and of ionization in scenario b , substantially modifies the predicted number of sources .",
    "moreover , figs .",
    "[ fig : detectable_imbhs_a ] and [ fig : detectable_imbhs ] show that one can obtain quite optimistic prospects for fermi ( with up to @xmath115 sources in reach of detection ) even assuming no detection by egret .    still , the constraints of ref .",
    "@xcite are extremely useful . in particular",
    ", these results bear on the possible implications of the mini - spikes scenario for the recent measurements of the positron and electron flux at high energy @xcite .",
    "the possibility that mini - spikes boost the annihilation signal thus providing the appropriate normalization of the positron flux is found to be viable , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pamela ] , and it would be interesting to see whether such a result holds for updated mini - spikes models . this would allow to circumvent the multi - messenger constraints ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in conclusion ,",
    "the mini - spike scenario provides the opportunity to discover a new population of sources ( imbhs ) and dm annihilations at the same time .",
    "the most prominent predicted signature of this scenario is unmistakable : the observation of many point - like sources , not correlated with the galactic disk , with an identical spectrum .",
    "it is therefore important , despite the various constraints and the many astrophysical uncertainties , to search for this population of objects in present and upcoming data , especially those of the gamma - ray satellite fermi .",
