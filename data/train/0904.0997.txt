    "stars are born in clusters , which upon formation are generally dense and massive . in recent years",
    "it has become clear that clusters remain bound even after losing a considerable fraction of their mass due to primordial out - gassing @xcite .",
    "the subsequent dynamical evolution of these clusters leads to a state of core collapse @xcite , almost irrespective of the number of primordial binaries @xcite ; primordial binaries do , however , appear to delay the collapse of the core @xcite . in addition , clusters with appropriate initial conditions may form a very massive star by means of runaway stellar collisions @xcite .",
    "such an object has been hypothised to be a progenitor of an intermediate mass black hole ( however , see @xcite ) .",
    "even if binaries are not present at the birth of a star cluster , they can form via three - body encounters during the process of core collapse . indeed ,",
    "the expansion of the cluster core after deep gravothermal collapse @xcite is mediated by binaries , regardless of the presence or absence of a primordial population . during post - core collapse evolution ,",
    "a cluster may enter a phase of gravothermal oscillations @xcite , allowing periods of high interaction rate and providing further opportunity for binaries and single stars to interact closely .",
    "analytic expressions describing encounters between a binary and a third star , all treated as point masses , have been derived for various portions of parameter space @xcite .",
    "in addition , complementary numerical surveys have been performed in the point mass approximation by a number of authors @xcite . during triple encounters , however , individual stars may approach close enough to each other that the approximation of point - particle dynamics breaks down : the size and internal structure of the stars then play a major role in determining the outcome of the encounter .",
    "consequently , some numerical studies have augmented the point - mass treatment with simplified models that incorporate several hydrodynamic effects @xcite .",
    "large - scale @xmath0-body simulations of clusters have demonstrated the ubiquity of resonance interactions in dynamically unstable triples the scenarios that ultimately may lead to the coalescence of all three stars @xcite .",
    "the accurate modelling of the details under which triples merge , and whether or not two or all three stars in an encounter participate in the merger , has a profound consequence for the occurrence of collision runaways @xcite and whether or not such runaways can lead to the formation of binaries among intermediate mass black holes @xcite .",
    "the first three - dimensional hydrodynamic calculations of encounters between a binary and a single star were performed by @xcite with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) method . however , computational constraints at that time limited their work to a very small number of sph particles ( usually 136 per star ) and to @xmath3 polytropes , appropriate only for white dwarfs or extremely low mass main sequence stars .",
    "subsequent hydrodynamic treatments of three - body interactions typically confined themselves to scenarios in which at least one of the stars was a compact object and therefore could be treated as a point mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . @xcite and",
    "@xcite consider three - body encounters between a binary and a red giant star as a mechanism for destroying red giants near the centres of dense stellar systems .",
    "their hydrodynamic simulations follow the fluid of the red giant envelope during the encounter , with the red giant core and both components of the binary being treated as point masses . because only the red giant envelope is treated hydrodynamically , the only mergers that can result are those which form a binary of the two point masses surrounded by a common envelope donated from the red giant envelope .",
    "numerous hydrodynamic simulations of colliding stars have studied the structure of the merger product @xcite . in some cases",
    "the evolution of these collision products is studied further @xcite , especially within the context of the formation and evolution of blue stragglers .",
    "such collision studies , however , have been focused on encounters between two single stars , ignoring for the time being that collisional cross sections and rates can be large for systems consisting of three or more stars .",
    "the scenario of triple - star mergers among low - mass main - sequence stars has been previously considered by @xcite using sph .",
    "their calculations indicate that the collision product always has a significantly enhanced cross - section and that the distribution of most chemical elements within the final product is not sensitive to many details of the initial conditions .",
    "they , however , concentrated solely on low mass stars and treated the triple star merger as two separate , consecutive parabolic collisions .",
    "recently , @xcite performed an extensive and detailed study to investigate the circumstances under which a first collision between stars occurs . using direct @xmath0-body integration with sticky spheres of realistic stellar sizes",
    ", they argued that binaries tend to catalyse collisions . in their simulations",
    "the binaries that are formed during core collapse tend to interact with an incoming star , which subsequently merges with one of the binary components .",
    "the results of @xcite suggest that the hydrodynamics of such interactions are unlikely to keep the binary itself undamaged . instead",
    ", it is quite likely that the stellar material that is expelled during a collision engulfs the system in a common envelope , leading to the merger of all three stars .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a new implementation of sph and apply it to follow accurately the hydrodynamics of encounters between hard binaries and intruders .",
    "we concentrate on cases involving massive main - sequence stars , such as those found in young star clusters , treating all three stars simultaneously and with realistic orbital parameters determined from a dynamical cluster calculation . in particular",
    ", the initial conditions are selected from the set of @xmath0-body simulations carried out by @xcite , but with the internal structure of the stars now being determined by a stellar evolution code .",
    "a comprehensive survey of triple - star collisions would need to explore an enormous amount of parameter space , but here we focus on a number of representative cases . in total",
    ", we selected 40 encounters from the simulations of @xcite . among these",
    "are random selections , as well as some that are specifically chosen because of their relevance for the subsequent @xmath0-body evolution or because of their uncertain outcome given the relatively simple treatment of mergers in the @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in  [ sect : methods ] we introduce our new formulation of sph , which allows efficient use of non - equal mass particles , as well as our approach for relaxing single stars . in  [ sect : relax_binary ] we describe how we model close and contact binary star systems , and we demonstrate the stability of these systems for at least the time interval of interest .",

    "smoothed particle hydrodynamics is the most widely used hydrodynamics scheme in the astrophysics community .",
    "it is a lagrangian particle method , meaning that the fluid is represented by a finite number of fluid elements or `` particles . ''",
    "associated with each particle @xmath4 are , for example , its position @xmath5 , velocity @xmath6 , and mass @xmath7 .",
    "each particle also carries a purely numerical smoothing length @xmath8 that determines the local spatial resolution and is used in the calculation of fluid properties such as acceleration and density .",
    "see and @xcite for reviews on sph .",
    "the code which we used in this work was presented in @xcite .",
    "however , we modify the dynamical equations to allow the efficient use a of range in particle masses .",
    "this modification is presented in appendix [ appendix : derivation ]      throughout this paper , numerical results are given in units where @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the newtonian gravitational constant and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the mass and radius of the sun .",
    "the units of time , velocity , and energy are then @xmath13      before initiating a triple star collision , we must first prepare an sph model for each star in isolation .",
    "to compute the structure and composition profiles of our parent stars , we use the twin stellar evolution code from the muse software environment @xcite .",
    "we evolve main - sequence stars with initial helium abundance @xmath14 and metallicity @xmath15 for a time @xmath16myr , a small enough age that even the most massive stars in a star cluster are still on the main sequence .",
    "the mass - radius relation which results from these calculations is shown in figure [ fig : ms ] .",
    "initially , we place the sph particles on a hexagonal close packed lattice , with particles extending out to a distance only a few smoothing lengths less than the full stellar radius .",
    "after the initial particle parameters have been assigned according to the desired profiles from twin , we allow the sph fluid to evolve into hydrostatic equilibrium . during this calculation",
    ", we include the artificial viscosity contribution to the sph acceleration equation so that energy is conserved , and we do not include a drag force on the particles . for the relaxation calculations of massive stars , we do , however , implement a method to keep low mass particles from being pushed to large radii : namely , during the initial stages of the relaxation , we implement a variation on the xsph method , in which the velocity used to update positions is the average of the actual particle velocity and the desired particle velocity ( zero ) .",
    "all our relaxed models remain static and stable when left to dynamically evolve in isolation .",
    "this approach allows us to model the desired profiles very accurately , and we present an example in figure [ fig : plnb073_m19 ] , where we plot desired profiles and sph particle data for a @xmath17 star .",
    "the structure and composition profiles of the sph model closely follow those from twin profiles , and the model remains stable when evolved dynamically .",
    "profiles are shown as a function of radius , after relaxation for 730 time units .",

    "in this section , we present our algorithm to model the close binary systems that are used in most of the triple star collisions ( see  [ sect : results ] ) .",
    "the first step in creating a binary is to relax each of the two stellar components in isolation , as described in the previous section . in the case of detached binaries , we place these relaxed stellar models along the @xmath26 axis with their centres of mass separated by the desired separation @xmath27 . for contact binaries ,",
    "however , we begin with the stars well separated and gradually decrease the semi - major axis until the desired separation is achieved , in order to minimise oscillations initiated by tidal forces . in all cases ,",
    "the centre of mass of the system remains fixed in space , which we choose to be the origin .    during the binary relaxation process",
    ", the positions of the particles within each star are adjusted at each timestep by simple uniform translations along the binary axis , such that the separation between the centres of mass equals the desired separation @xmath27 . simultaneously , the angular velocity @xmath28 defining the co - rotating frame is continuously updated , such that the net centrifugal and gravitational accelerations of the two stars cancel exactly : @xmath29 where @xmath30 symbolizes a sum over all particles in star @xmath31 . here",

    "a centrifugal acceleration is given to all particles such that the system approaches a steady state corresponding to a synchronised binary .",
    "as in the relaxation process of a single star , we also include the artificial viscosity contribution to the sph acceleration equation .",
    "this approach allows us to create close binaries that remain in dynamically stable orbits for many hundreds of orbits , if not indefinitely .",

    "the epicyclic oscillations , with a period of 650 time units , are clearly visible .",

    "this limit , the epicyclic period would formally approach infinity @xcite . the innermost dynamically stable orbit",
    "then marks the transition when the squared frequency of the epicyclic oscillations passes from a positive to a negative value , so that the qualitative behaviour of perturbations changes from oscillatory to exponential . throughout the calculation ,",
    "the perturbations remain small and actually damp with time : the internal energy @xmath33 remains constant to within about 0.03% , the gravitational energy @xmath34 to within about 0.008% , and the kinetic energy to within about 0.2% .",

    "the stars were modelled as hard spheres with a given mass and corresponding radius .",
    "a collision occurs when two spheres experience physical contact , or in other words , when the separation between the centre of these spheres is equal to the sum of their radii .",
    "this treatment of collisions , known as the sticky sphere approximation , conserves total mass and momentum .    in this paper , however , we resolve the stellar structure and focus on isolated close three - body interactions . this can be justified since usually such interactions last less than a year , and therefore local conditions hardly change on such a short timescale .",
    "all three - body interactions we split in two groups : the interaction between a binary and a single star , and the interaction between three single stars which are in the middle of a resonant interaction .",
    "the latter case is straightforward to model , as we need to prepare only relaxed single star models , as described in ",
    "[ sect : methods ] , and then assign the appropriate initial positions and velocities to each of the stars . the actual dynamical interaction process is then modelled using the sph code .    in the case of an interaction between a binary and a single star , we initially relax the binary as described in ",
    "[ sect : relax_binary ] .",
    "the binary separation is taken from the @xmath0-body simulations .",

    "the synthetic stellar evolution part of @xmath0-body calculations predict a binary separation too small to be dynamically stable , and in such cases we relax an sph model of the binary near the smallest possible semi - major axis such that the binary remains stable or quasi - stable , such that the merger time - scale is at least a few thousand time units .",

    "the ratio @xmath42 gives a measure of how much energy is being brought to the system by the intruder , relative to the binding energy of the binary .",
    "a negative value of @xmath43 implies that the intruder star is bound to the binary , otherwise it is initially unbound .",
