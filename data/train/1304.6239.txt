    "consider water that flows past a fishing line , which we model as a pressure distribution applied near the surface .",
    "as @xcite demonstrated , if the velocity of the stream is kept above some critical velocity , then capillary waves are produced upstream and gravity waves downstream . however ,",
    "if the speed of the stream is too small , then subcritical or supercitical solitary waves are produced instead .",
    "this classification of the dynamics holds similarly for many flows past more general obstructions , where we can linearise the geometry in one or several of its dimensions .",
    "thus , typical linearised theory does not really distinguish between flows past differently shaped objects , but merely requires that they are sufficiently small [ see _ e.g. _ @xcite and @xcite ] .",
    "the question which we address in this paper is : _ what can be said about gravity - capillary flows over obstructions which are not linearised _ ?",
    "there are two important parameters : the froude number , @xmath0 ( ratio of inertial to gravitational forces ) and the bond number , @xmath1 ( ratio of gravitational to surface tension forces ) . in a previous work",
    "( @xcite  henceforth referred to as part 1 ) we showed how the typical linearised theory can be re - interpreted in the low - froude and low - bond limits . if @xmath2 is the speed of the free - surface flow , and @xmath3 while @xmath4 , then the typical asymptotic expansion gives the _ base series _ , which we denote as ( 0,0 ) circle ( 4pt ) node[scale=0.65 ] * b * ; , and write @xmath5 \\draw[fill = white ] ( 0,0 ) circle ( 4pt ) node[scale=0.65 ] { \\footnotesize \\textbf{b}};\\!\\ ! } } \\quad \\bigl [ q_0\\ , + \\epsilon q_1 + \\epsilon^2 q_2 + \\mathcal{o}(\\epsilon^3 ) \\bigr ] e^0,\\ ] ]    valid as @xmath6 .",
    "the base series , ( 0,0 ) circle ( 4pt ) node[scale=0.65 ] * b * ; , is waveless to every order , and in fact , the gravity and capillary waves are exponentially small and thus _ beyond - all - orders_. these waves are _ switched - on _ when ( 0,0 ) circle ( 4pt ) node[scale=0.65 ] * b * ; is analytically continued across critical curves ( _ stokes lines _ ) in the complex plane in a process known as the _ stokes phenomenon_. we use the notation ( 0,0 ) circle ( 4pt ) node[scale=0.65 ] * b * ; @xmath7 ( 0,0 ) circle ( 4pt ) node[scale=0.65 ] * g * ; or ( 0,0 ) circle ( 4pt ) node[scale=0.65 ] * b * ; @xmath7 ( 0,0 ) circle ( 4pt ) node[scale=0.65 ] * c * ; to indicate the switching - on of a gravity or capillary wave , respectively , and these waves are written as @xmath8 \\draw[fill = white ] ( 0,0 ) circle ( 4pt ) node[scale=0.65 ] { \\footnotesize \\textbf{g}};\\!\\ ! } } \\quad \\bigl [ a_1 + \\mathcal{o}(\\epsilon)\\bigr ] e^{-\\chi_g/\\epsilon } \\qquad \\text{and } \\quad \\qquad \\text { {   \\tikz[baseline=-3pt ] \\draw[fill = white ] ( 0,0 ) circle ( 4pt ) node[scale=0.65 ] { \\footnotesize \\textbf{c}};\\!\\ ! } } \\quad \\bigl [ b_1 + \\mathcal{o}(\\epsilon)\\bigr ] e^{-\\chi_c/\\epsilon}.\\ ] ]    in the linearised problem of flow over a step ( part 1 ) , stokes lines originate from the single , merged singularity which represents the step , and the point where the gravity and capillary waves are equal in magnitude corresponds to the critical bifurcation in the froude - bond plane .",
    "the nonlinear analysis of this work differs from the linear analysis in two important ways .",
    "first , a nonlinear geometry usually contains multiple singularities and hence multiple stokes lines ; each singularity then has the potential to produce both gravity and capillary waves .",
    "second , gravity and capillary waves can _ themselves _ interact , with ( 0,0 ) circle ( 4pt ) node[scale=0.65 ]",
    "* g * ; @xmath7 ( 0,0 ) circle ( 4pt ) node[scale=0.65 ] * c * ; or ( 0,0 ) circle ( 4pt ) node[scale=0.65 ] * c * ; @xmath7 ( 0,0 ) circle ( 4pt ) node[scale=0.65 ] * g * ; .",
    "these more complicated secondary switchings may be accompanied by crossing stokes lines , the higher - order stokes phenomenon , and other , more advanced , aspects of exponential asymptotics highlighted by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "our main result shows that for a nonlinear obstruction , the typical bifurcation curve in the froude - bond plane _ thickens _ , revealing new possibilities for solutions .",
    "the thickness of this curve is a manifestation of the finite nature of the obstruction , and shrinks to zero as the geometry is linearised .",
    "for example , in the case of a rectangular step , rather than the two standard linear solutions of @xcite , there are now _ six _ possible solutions , for which the previous two are special cases .      a review of the physical and mathematical literature that motivates this work can be found in the introduction of part 1 @xcite .",
    "the situation of free - surface gravity - capillary waves produced by flow past an obstruction is a well studied problem , and so we shall only mention the more comprehensive reviews of the topic by @xcite and @xcite , and of course , classic texts by @xcite and @xcite .    as for the mathematical techniques we use in this paper known as _ exponential asymptotics _ ,",

    "we briefly recapitulate the relevant equations , which parallel the ones presented in part 1 , but this time , we allow for the possibility of flows over more general geometries . consider steady , two - dimensional potential flow of an incompressible fluid with upstream velocity @xmath9 , and a prescribed length scale @xmath10 .",

    "the full expressions for the higher @xmath45 terms are prohibitively complicated , but since we are mainly concerned with the limit @xmath46 , we may proceed in the following manner : the complexification of the leading - order free surface , @xmath47 will typically contain singularities , identifiable with singularities in the flow - domain , such as those corresponding to corners or stagnation points .",
    "however , because all the higher - order problems are linear , no new singularities can be introduced and thus , for all @xmath48 , the singular points of @xmath49 must be those _ same _ points as for @xmath47 .",
    "now if we examine the dynamic condition , we can see that each successive term of the asymptotic approximation requires the derivative of the previous term .",
    "then if @xmath49 contains a singularity of the form @xmath50 , @xmath51 will contain a singularity of the form @xmath52 .",
    "thus as @xmath53 , we can expect the late terms to behave like factorial over power , or @xmath54    in fact , the inductive argument used to explain the divergence of the asymptotic expansion according to also serves to explain why the free surface waves are expected to be exponentially small in the limit @xmath6 : the leading order solution is waveless , and since the values of @xmath49 and @xmath55 only depend on the derivatives of the previous orders , then none of the terms in the naive expansion will contain waves .",

    "the inset confirms that if we analytically continue around the scp , beginning with the base solution upstream , then a portion of the new stokes line must switch off across the scp ( gray , dashed ) .",
    "[ fig : gcwave_realcont],scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in addition to the appearance of the secondary singularity , intersecting stokes lines are typically accompanied by yet another subtlety : that of the higher - order stokes phenomenon [ see again @xcite and @xcite ] .",
    "this phenomenon specifies that at a scp , stokes lines may themselves switch - off .",
    "indeed , this must be the case because if we analytically continue around the scp in the inset of figure [ fig : gcwaves_region456](c ) , we see that both portions of the ( 0,0 ) circle ( 4pt ) node[scale=0.65 ] * b * ; @xmath7 ( 0,0 ) circle ( 4pt ) node[scale=0.65 ] * c * ; line ( on either side of the scp ) can not be active .",
    "it remains to determine whether the portion of the stokes line connecting the singularity to the scp is active , or whether it is rather the portion from the scp to the free surface .    to address this issue , we note in figure [ fig : gcwave_realcont ] that if the dashed stokes line is followed from the scp to the secondary singularity into the lower half - plane , then it changes from a ( 0,0 ) circle ( 4pt ) node[scale=0.65 ] * b * ; @xmath7 ( 0,0 ) circle ( 4pt ) node[scale=0.65 ] * c * ; stokes line to a ( 0,0 ) circle ( 4pt ) node[scale=0.65 ] * b * ; @xmath7 ( 0,0 ) circle ( 4pt ) node[scale=0.65 ] * g * ; stokes line across the secondary singularity ( @xmath403 ) .",
    "in fact , the portion of the axis where @xmath411 , corresponds to the anti - stokes lines ( where ( 0,0 ) circle ( 4pt ) node[scale=0.65 ] * b * ; @xmath412 ( 0,0 ) circle ( 4pt ) node[scale=0.65 ] * c * ; @xmath412 ( 0,0 ) circle ( 4pt ) node[scale=0.65 ] * g * ; ) from the corner ( @xmath277 ) and turning point ( @xmath264 ) . across the secondary singularity ,",
    "then , the stokes line has changed character abruptly , and we argue by analogy to studies of the higher - order stokes phenomenon that this can not occur unless @xmath413 is a turning point ( which it is not ) .",
    "thus , the portion of the stokes lines connected to the secondary singularity is inactive .",
    "finally , we add that in figure [ fig : gcwave_realcont ] , the dashed stokes line is the only line associated with secondary riemann sheets that we have chosen to show .",
    "there are other stokes lines we have not shown ( and in fact , other secondary singularities ) , but these are not relevant to the free surface waves ."
