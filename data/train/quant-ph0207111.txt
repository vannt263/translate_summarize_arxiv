    "the method of using spatially separated fields as proposed by ramsey has been proved to be very useful for high resolution work .",
    "it was originally proposed as a technique in the microwave domain @xcite which was then extended to studies in optical domain @xcite .",
    "more recently , this technique has been used very successfully in the studies of quantum entanglement resulting from the interaction of atoms with radiation in a high quality cavity . in this context ramsey technique",
    "enables one to study the entanglement in different basis of states@xcite .",
    "haroche and coworkers detected a variety of cavity quantum electrodynamics effects @xcite by monitoring changes in ramsey fringe pattern when a cavity was placed in region between two ramsey zones .",
    "ramsey technique has also been suggested for the measurement of phase diffusion in a micromaser @xcite .",
    "the existence of fringes in ramsey technique has been interpreted as due to quantum interferences in the transition amplitudes and thus ramsey technique is a way of doing atomic interferometry @xcite .",
    "all these studies consider the field in each ramsey zone as a coherent field which is prescribed and which does not evolve even though it is interacting with the atom .",
    "now that the interference effects at a single photon or few photon levels are becoming quite common , it is natural to enquire how the results of ramsey interferometry would be modified if the coherent field in each ramsey zone is replaced by a quantized field @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we examine the theory of ramsey interferometry with quantized fields . in sec.iii",
    ", we bring out the role of the quantum statistics of the fields in ramsey interferometry and examine the conditions on the fields so that interference fringes are obtained .",
    "if the fields in the two ramsey zones are in a state with fixed number of photons , then interferences disappear @xcite . though fields with exactly one photon do not yield interferences ,",
    "a small coherent field even at a single photon level can lead to a well - defined interference pattern .",
    "further , we show photon - photon interaction can be mediated by a single atom passing through the two cavities . in sec.iv",
    ", we compare this work to our previous work@xcite and recent experiment of bertet etal.@xcite on complementarity and quantum eraser . in sec.v , we demonstrate an analog of hanbury - browntwiss experiment in the context of ramsey interferometry with quantized fields by calculating atom - atom correlations @xcite in atoms passing through two successive ramsey zones containing quantized field @xcite . in the case of fixed number of photons in the cavities",
    ", interference does not occur in the excitation probability of a single atom .",
    "we show how the interference can be observed by passing successively two atoms through the cavities and by detecting both atoms in the excited states . finally , we consider the effect of decoherence in ramsey interferometry .",
    "we demonstrate the entanglement of the fields in the two ramsey zones .",
    "such an entanglement results from the passage of an atom @xcite .",
    "we generate various entangled states by passing a single or two atoms through cavities and show entanglement can be transfered from fields to atoms . in sec.vi , we consider the atom - cavity interaction in the dispersive limit and show the generation of the entangled state of two coherent fields of the form @xmath1 .",
    "we consider a high quality cavity @xcite as the ramsey zone of quantized field .",
    "if the number of photons in the cavity is large and the field has a well - defined phase , then it would approach the classical ramsey interferometry .",
    "we thus consider the situation shown in the fig.1 .",
    "an atom with two levels @xmath2 and @xmath3 interacts with two single mode cavities with identical frequencies .",
    "let the annihilation and creation operators in the i - th cavity be denoted by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "for the situation shown in the fig.1 , the hamiltonian in the interaction picture is @xmath6 here @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the coupling constant of the atom with the vacuum in the i - th cavity .",
    "let us consider an initial state with atom in the lower state @xmath3 and the fields characterized by the state @xmath9 .",
    "here @xmath10 represents the fock state in first(second ) cavity .",
    "let @xmath11 be the phase shifts in @xmath2 and @xmath3 which we might introduce using same external perturbation between the cavities . using the interaction hamiltonian",
    "@xmath12 the time evolution of the state can be calculated .",
    "the state of the atom and cavity fields is found to be @xmath13|g , n,\\mu\\rangle\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{n,\\mu } \\left[f_{n+1,\\mu } s_{n}^{*}(\\tau_{1})c_{\\mu}^{*}(\\tau_{2})\\exp\\left(i\\delta(\\tau_{1}+\\tau_{2})/2-i\\phi_{e } \\right)\\right.\\nonumber\\\\    & ~&+\\left.f_{n,\\mu+1}c_{n-1}(\\tau_{1})s_{\\mu}^{*}(\\tau_{2})\\exp\\left(i\\delta(\\tau_{1}+\\tau_{2}+2t)/2 -i\\phi_{g}\\right)\\right]|e , n,\\mu\\rangle~ , \\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 . + the functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 describe the dynamics of the atom interacting with a single mode cavity with initial state as a fock state .",
    "note that @xmath18(@xmath19 ) gives the probability amplitude of finding the atom in the excited(ground ) state given that it was in the excited state at time @xmath20 .",
    "the structure of the state clearly suggests the elementary process responsible for the final state .",
    "a given final state is reached in two different ways .",
    "consider a measurement in which the outgoing atom is found in the excited state .",
    "the probability of excitation @xmath21 defined by @xmath22 can be calculated using eq.@xmath23 .",
    "we find the result @xmath24 where @xmath25    a similar result is obtained for @xmath26 i.e. the probability of finding the atom in the ground state if initially the atom is in the excited state , @xmath27 in particular if each cavity is in vacuum state and @xmath28 then we get much simpler result , @xmath29 which exhibits no interferences as it is phase independent .",
    "the results @xmath30 and @xmath31 are important for understanding ramsey interferometry with quantized fields .",
    "these give rise to a number of important consequences as far as the fundamentals of atom - field interaction are concerned . for classical fields result@xmath31",
    "can be modified , as probability amplitude functions @xmath32 is peaked around average number of photons @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "so in the summation we can replace @xmath35 further for large @xmath36 and @xmath37 , we replace , @xmath38 for normalised photon probability amplitude functions @xmath32 eq.@xmath31 reduces to , @xmath39 equation @xmath40 is the result for classical fields .",
    "we now examine the consequences of the quantized nature of the field , and in particular investigate when the interferences are most pronounced . from the result@xmath30 ,",
    "we see there are two paths which contribute to the amplitude for detecting the atom in excited state @xmath41 the interference between these two paths depends on the nature of the photon statistics i.e. on the functions @xmath32 .",
    "clearly if the field in each cavity is in a fock state @xmath42 @xmath43 then the interference terms in @xmath30 drop out and the two paths @xmath31 become independent .",
    "this happens even for fock states with large number of photons .",
    "interferences are obtained as long as the photon statistics is such that @xmath44 in order to understand the meaning of eq.(9 ) , consider a situation where detuning @xmath45 can be ignored while considering evolution in ramsey zone i.e. in each cavity .",
    "the condition ( 9 ) can be reduced to a very interesting form @xmath46 which for small interaction times reduces to @xmath47 thus the nature of interference depends on the quantum statistics of the fields in the two ramsey zones .",
    "the conditions @xmath48 and @xmath49 imply that if the cavities are independent , then the field in each cavity must have a well defined phase for interference to occur .",
    "the interference would also not occur if one cavity has a definite number of photons and the other has a field in coherent state .",
    "however , interference is obtained if fields in the two cavities are entangled even though the field in each cavity does not have a well - defined phase . in fig.[fig5 ] , results for classical as well as quantized fields are plotted when each ramsey zone has a coherent field with average number of photons @xmath50 .",
    "interference fringes for classical fields show higher visibility than in the case of quantized fields .      having shown that ramsey fringes vanish",
    "if each cavity contains one photon , the next question arises what happens if the field in each cavity is at single photon level@xcite . for this purpose",
    ", we consider a case where each cavity is pumped by a weak coherent state so that the initial state of the cavities is @xmath51 in this case , the result @xmath30 leads to @xmath52\\right| ^{2}+o(|\\alpha|^{4})~ , \\label{eq13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which for @xmath53 and @xmath54 reduces to @xmath55 this leads to high visibility for the fringes(about@xmath56 ) .",
    "it is clear that the interference in @xmath57 arises from the cross terms in @xmath58 as such cross terms lead to the same final state via two different pathways latexmath:[\\ ] ] which on using the values of @xmath159 and @xmath160 leads to the compact result @xmath161 if we choose the interaction times such that @xmath162 , and @xmath163 and setting @xmath164 , the state @xmath165 becomes @xmath166 if we detect the atom after passing through the cavities in the state @xmath167 , then the state of the field is reduced to , @xmath168 the state @xmath169 is the entangled state of two coherent fields .",
    "before we conclude , we mention that cavities are not absolutely essential for doing ramsey interferometry with quantized fields , though the usage of cavities results in the enhancement of atom - photon interaction .",
    "we could , for example , imagine the usage of the correlated photons produced by a down converter for doing ramsey interferometry though such an interaction would be quite weak .",
    "a possible arrangement is shown in the fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "the final results for the interference pattern can be obtained in a way similar to the derivation of the result @xmath30 .",
    "the visibility of the interference pattern depends on the characteristics of the beam splitter and correlations between the down converted photons .",
    "note that the arrangement of the fig.[fig3 ] generally makes @xmath170  .",
    "for the input state @xmath171 the output state is @xcite , @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the reflectivity of the beam splitter . for this state output modes",
    "are correlated i.e. @xmath174 as long as @xmath175  .",
    "we note in passing that the problem of weak interaction between the atom and single photon could possibly be overcome by considering a collective system such as a bose condensate @xcite .",
    "the two ramsey zones can be realised in the free expansion of a condensate .",
    "the interaction in such a case would be enhanced by the square root of the density of atoms .    in conclusion",
    "we have discussed in detail the theory of ramsey interferometry with quantized fields .",
    "the interference is very sensitive to the quantum statistics of the fields in the two ramsey zones .",
    "we have derived general conditions for interference to occur .",
    "we have shown how an analog of hanbury - brown twiss photon - photon correlation interferometry can be used to discern a variety of interference effects even in situations where the single atom detection probabilities do not exhibit interferences .",
    "we have demonstrated atoms acting as a mediator for photon - photon interaction between two cavities and entanglement can be transfered from fields to atoms .",
    "we have generated entangled state of two and three photons by passing two and three atoms through the cavities .",
    "further we have shown the generation of the entangled state of two coherent fields @xmath1 by using cavities in dispersive limit .",
