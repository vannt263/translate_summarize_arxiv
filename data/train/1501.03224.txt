    "<S> * the single - particle density is the most basic quantity that can be calculated from a given many - body wave function . </S>",
    "<S> it provides the probability to find a particle at a given position when the average over many realizations of an experiment is taken . </S>",
    "<S> however , the outcome of single experimental shots of ultracold atom experiments is determined by the @xmath0-particle probability density . </S>",
    "<S> this difference can lead to surprising results . </S>",
    "<S> for example , independent bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) with definite particle numbers form interference fringes even though no fringes would be expected based on the single - particle density @xcite . by drawing random deviates from the @xmath0-particle probability density single experimental shots </S>",
    "<S> can be simulated from first principles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , obtaining expressions for the @xmath0-particle probability density of realistic time - dependent many - body systems has so far been elusive . here , </S>",
    "<S> we show how single experimental shots of general ultracold bosonic systems can be simulated based on numerical solutions of the many - body schrdinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> we show how full counting distributions of observables involving any number of particles can be obtained and how correlation functions of any order can be evaluated . as examples we show the appearance of interference fringes in interacting independent becs , fluctuations in the collisions of strongly attractive becs , the appearance of randomly fluctuating vortices in rotating systems and the center of mass fluctuations of attractive becs in a harmonic trap . </S>",
    "<S> the method described is broadly applicable to bosonic many - body systems whose phenomenology is driven by information beyond what is typically available in low - order correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> *    let us briefly outline how single experimental shots can be simulated from a general many - body wave function @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the probability to find @xmath0 particles at positions @xmath2 in a many - body system is determined by the @xmath0-particle probability distribution @xmath3 . in experiments on ultracold bosons snapshots of the positions of the particles </S>",
    "<S> are taken and single experimental shots sample the @xmath0-particle probability distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this distribution is high - dimensional and sampling it directly from a given @xmath0-boson wave function is hopeless . </S>",
    "<S> however , it can be rewritten as a product of conditional probabilities @xmath4 where e.g. @xmath5 denotes the conditional probability to find a particle at @xmath6 given that another particle is at @xmath7 . by drawing @xmath7 from @xmath8 , @xmath6 from @xmath9 , @xmath10 from @xmath11 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> , one random deviate of @xmath12 is generated . </S>",
    "<S> obtaining the conditional probabilities in ( [ pr ] ) is a formidable combinatorial problem though , even for special cases @xcite . here </S>",

    "<S> this combination of many - body schrdinger dynamics and sampling of the @xmath0-particle probability allows us to simulate single experimental shots from first principles in realistic settings , see methods for the algorithm and details .    </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to briefly review bose - einstein condensation . </S>",
    "<S> a many - boson state is condensed if its reduced single - particle density matrix has exactly one nonzero eigenvalue @xmath17 of order @xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues @xmath17 are known as natural occupations , the eigenvectors as natural orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> the bec is fragmented if more than one eigenvalue @xmath17 is of order @xmath0 @xcite , see methods for details . </S>",
    "<S> fully condensed states , i.e. states with @xmath18 , are of the form @xmath19 . </S>",

    "<S> for instance , gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) mean - field states are of this form . </S>",
    "<S> any other state , in particular fragmented states , exhibit correlations and vice versa any correlated state is to some degree fragmented . </S>",
    "<S> we will now show how fragmented becs lead to macroscopically fluctuating outcomes in single shots .    in the following we use dimensionless units @xmath20 and solve the time - dependent many - body schrdinger equation @xmath21 using the mctdhb method @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath22 denotes a general many - body hamiltonian in @xmath23 dimensions with an external potential @xmath24 and a regularized contact interaction @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> we parameterize the interaction strength by the mean - field parameter @xmath26 , see methods for details .    </S>",
    "<S> let us begin with an example of two interfering , independent condensates of @xmath27 bosons in an elongated trap with tight harmonic confinement along the @xmath28 direction such that we can work in @xmath29 dimensions and @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> we use @xmath31 as an external potential , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are harmonic traps and @xmath34 is an additional gaussian potential that flattens the bottom of the trap along the @xmath35-direction . as an initial state we use two independent condensates , each of which is the mean - field ground state ( corresponding to @xmath36 in the mctdhb formalism ) of @xmath37 bosons of the displaced traps @xmath38 with @xmath39 in harmonic oscillator units of the @xmath40-direction at an interaction strength @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the initial state @xmath42 is fragmented with @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> we then solve the time - dependent many - body schrdinger equation for @xmath44 using @xmath45 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows the single - particle density as well as random deviates of the @xmath0-particle density at different times . </S>",
    "<S> the two condensates accelerate towards each other , collide and separate again . during the collision interference fringes appear in deviates of the @xmath0-particle density at locations that fluctuate randomly from shot to shot , but not in the single - particle density . </S>",
    "<S> this is also expected based on simplified models @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , here this result follows directly from the solution of the many - body schrdinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> the interparticle interaction is weak here ; interaction effects only become visible as ripples in the density after the collision and the natural occupations remain practically constant all along .    </S>",
    "<S> we now go one step further and investigate collisions between strongly attractive independent condensates in the same trap . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we use @xmath46 bosons at an interaction strength @xmath47 which is about @xmath48 above the threshold for collapse of the gp mean - field ground state in this trap . for the initial state </S>",
    "<S> we first compute the many - body ground state of fifty bosons using two orbitals and imaginary time - propagation . </S>",
    "<S> this ground state is highly condensed , @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the initial state is then taken as the symmetrized product of the ground state and a displaced copy of it located at @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the initial state has natural occupations @xmath51 and @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> we then propagate this initial state using @xmath53 orbitals .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ( a ) shows the single particle - density at different times . </S>",
    "<S> the condensates approach each other without spreading significantly , collide and separate again . during the collision the single - particle density exhibits two maxima , </S>",
    "<S> the condensates seem to bounce off each other . </S>",
    "<S> however , single shots at the time of the collision reveal a different result , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ( b ) . in about half of all shots a strongly localized density maximum is visible , whereas in the other half two smaller well separated maxima appear . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that at no point any type of ( possibly random ) phase relationship between the colliding parts was assumed . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , for independent condensates the assumption of a preexisting , but random relative phase is at variance with quantum mechanics @xcite . the macroscopic fluctuations in the outcomes follow directly from the intrinsic correlations of the many - body state . fig . 2 ( c ) shows the natural occupations of the system . as long as the condensates are far apart , </S>",
    "<S> the natural occupations remain close to their initial values . </S>",
    "<S> however , during the collision two additional natural orbitals become occupied indicating a buildup of even stronger correlations . as a consequence after the collision </S>",
    "<S> the system can no longer be separated into two independent condensates .    in the previous two examples </S>",
    "<S> already the initial states were fragmented . </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to a system where fragmentation builds up dynamically . </S>",
    "<S> stirring a bec can lead to fragmentation and vortex nucleation that can not be explained within the mean - field framework of quantized vortices @xcite . consider the ground state of a repulsively interacting bec of @xmath27 bosons in a pancake shaped trap with @xmath54 at an interaction strength @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the many - body ground state using @xmath45 orbitals which is practically fully condensed with @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> we then switch on a time - dependent stirring potential @xmath57 $ ] that imparts angular momentum onto the bec . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58 and @xmath59 vary harmonically and the amplitude @xmath60 is linearly ramped up from zero to a finite value and back down , see methods for details . fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ( a ) shows the density together with single shots at different times . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the natural occupations is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ( b ) . while the system is condensed , single shots reproduce the single - particle density . over the course of time </S>",
    "<S> an additional natural orbital becomes occupied and the bec becomes correlated . </S>",
    "<S> as correlations build up the outcome of single shots fluctuates more and more and vortices appear at random locations in every single shot . </S>",
    "<S> this is in stark contrast to mean - field theory , where due to the lack of correlations vortices always appear at the same location .    as a last example </S>",
    "<S> let us show how full distribution functions of @xmath0-body operators can be evaluated by simulating single shots . </S>",
    "<S> consider the ground state of @xmath0 attractively interacting bosons in a harmonic trap , @xmath61 , in one dimension , i.e. @xmath62 and @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the exact wave function of the center of mass coordinate @xmath64 of the many - body ground state is given by a gaussian @xmath65 with @xmath66 @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the mean - field ground state is uncorrelated and hence its center of mass width is given by @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the variance of the mean - field orbital @xmath69 , see methods . </S>",
    "<S> in the limit of a weak trap , @xmath70 , the mean - field solution approaches a soliton with @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for sufficiently strong attractive interaction @xmath72 exceeds @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the ground state of @xmath74 bosons at an interaction strength @xmath75 using imaginary time - propagation for different numbers of orbitals . from the obtained ground states we generate @xmath76 random deviates of the center of mass coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 shows fits to the obtained histograms of the center of mass deviates together with the exact center of mass distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the many - body result for @xmath77 orbitals is indistinguishable from the exact one and significantly broader than the mean - field ( @xmath36 ) result . in the present example </S>",
    "<S> the many - body correlations are the cause for the onset of the delocalization of the ground state . </S>"
