    "s0 galaxies are enigmatic objects whose formation and evolution is still not well understood .",
    "originally , these galaxies were postulated to exist as a transition class between the elliptical and spiral sequence @xcite .",
    "both elliptical and s0 galaxies lack spiral arms or major dust features .",
    "however , early work on the ellipticity distributions of galaxies showed that s0 galaxies were disk - dominated systems with ellipticity distributions that differed from ellipticals , being more similar to spiral galaxies in their intrinsic shapes ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . the early work on the morphology - density relation by @xcite emphasized that s0s and ellipticals both occur with higher frequency in higher density environments , while the pioneering studies of @xcite and @xcite began to provide hints about how the early - type population of elliptical and s0 galaxies might evolve out to redshifts around 0.5 and earlier .",
    "however , it was not until _ hst _ allowed comprehensive high - resolution imaging of distant clusters of galaxies that @xcite , for example , and others began to show directly that the s0 fraction was changing at high redshift .",
    "this early work , along with more recent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) found smaller s0 galaxy fractions in clusters of galaxies at higher redshifts , @xmath13 .",
    "the implication is that the s0 galaxy population forms with different time - scales and later than the elliptical population .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and , most recently , @xcite all find that the majority of evolution occurs since @xmath14 , i.e. , in the past 4 gyrs , and above those redshifts there is little or no evolution in the early - type galaxy fraction in clusters of galaxies out to @xmath9 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a different point of view ) .",
    "since s0 and elliptical galaxies have different ellipticity distributions and bulge - to - disk distributions , two simple ( and related ) predictions that can be drawn from the observed changes in s0 fraction with redshift is that both the mean bulge - to - disk ratio of early - type cluster galaxies and the ellipticity distribution should have changed over relatively recent epochs ( since @xmath15 ) .",
    "the evidence for evolution in the s0 population of clusters rests primarily on morphological classifications of galaxies .",
    "the separation of the early - type galaxy population into s0 and elliptical galaxies has long been recognized as being a challenging task ( see , for example , @xcite for a discussion of the systematic errors in classification and how misclassification mimics evolution . )",
    "s0 galaxies are defined as multicomponent disk galaxies , while ellipticals are defined as single component systems . however",
    ", a number of quantitative studies found that a substantial fraction of ellipticals have `` disky '' isophotes ( see * ? ? ? * for a summary ) in contrast with this definition .",
    "the analysis of @xcite exemplifies the challenge of establishing the relative contributions of elliptical and s0 galaxies .",
    "they showed , for a @xmath10 galaxy , that detecting a disk component in a spheroidal galaxy is increasingly difficult as the disk becomes more face - on in projection .",
    "@xcite found that a disk containing 20% of the total light of a galaxy is impossible to detect over half of the range of @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the inclination angle .",
    "specifically , they note `` since the cos @xmath17 axis can be interpreted as a probability axis , this implies that 50% of all disks with @xmath18 can not be detected by photometric means . ''",
    "these , however , results for a single galaxy . for an ensemble of galaxies , the bulge - to - disk ratio distribution can be constrained by the intrinsic ellipticity distribution , with the average observed ellipticity being directly related to the intrinsic ellipticity @xcite . therefore , examining the distribution of galaxy ellipticities provides a direct measure of the evolution in the distribution of the bulge - to - disk ratios of that galaxy population .",
    "@xcite investigated the ellipticity distribution of elliptical and s0 galaxies in the coma cluster , and suggested that elliptical and s0 galaxies were not distinct classes but were part of a continuum of objects of varying bulge - to - disk ratios .",
    "this result was given additional support by a recent study by @xcite who found that 69% of elliptical galaxies have multiple kinematic components , generally disk - like components , while 92% of s0 galaxies have disk - like components .",
    "these results give emphasis to the view that elliptical and s0 galaxies form a continuous distribution of disk fraction as opposed to two distinct classes .",
    "in particular , @xcite constructed a model of the ellipticity distribution of elliptical and s0 galaxies using a continuum of bulge and disk components viewed from a variety of angles .",
    "@xcite found a deficit of round s0 galaxies , in contrast with what was expected from their model , suggesting that some face - on s0 galaxies had been classified as ellipticals . @xcite and",
    "@xcite also found a lack of round s0 galaxies in three @xmath19 clusters of galaxies when compared to what was expected for a disk population viewed at a variety of angles .",
    "these three studies illustrate a potential bias in the visual classification of galaxies , namely that nearly face - on s0 galaxies galaxies may be incorrectly classified as ellipticals .",
    "a number of studies suggest that quantitative measurements do not suffer the same orientation bias as visual classifications @xcite , but robust , bias - free galaxy classification , either visual or quantitative , still remains an elusive goal .",
    "the importance of the work showing an apparent evolution in the s0 fraction in clusters and the knowledge of potential classification biases led @xcite and @xcite to investigate the ellipticity distributions of the s0 and elliptical galaxies in their samples . in general",
    ", the authors found that the ellipticity distributions of s0 and elliptical galaxies show no evolution over the broad redshift ranges in their samples ( * ? ? ?",
    "* compared clusters from @xmath20 to @xmath21 ) . also , the ellipticity distributions of elliptical and s0 galaxies differ from each other , providing evidence for the existence of two distinct classes of galaxies . however , these previous studies do not use a consistent measure of the ellipticity as compared with the @xmath10 efforts such as @xcite or @xcite , making a comparison between these @xmath22 samples observed with _ hst _ and @xmath5 samples observed from the ground difficult .",
    "traditionally , ellipticities for galaxies at @xmath10 were measured by visual estimates @xcite or by fitting models to the elliptical isophotes @xcite . at higher redshifts , @xmath22 , the ellipticities in @xcite or @xcite are determined by the second - order flux - weighted moments of a detection isophote .",
    "both the data and the techniques have matured so that we can now evaluate the ellipticity distribution , as a function of redshift , quantitatively , and even more importantly , in a consistent way with minimal systematic error .",
    "we show that some approaches used previously that could not correct for the point - spread function ( psf ) are probably subject to significant systematic error .",
    "essentially , the `` blurring '' effect of the psf will lead to galaxies being measured as rounder than they actually are .",
    "we will use a single consistent and robust approach for measuring the ellipticities at all redshifts .",
    "the ellipticities will be measured by fitting models convolved with the psf to galaxy surface brightness profiles .",
    "this will eliminate some of the previously - reported uncertainties found when comparing ground - based imaging data taken under different seeing conditions ( see * ? ? ? * for some discussion ) .",
    "in addition , this approach essentially eliminates the systematic error associated with the psf `` blurring '' .",
    "our ellipticity measurements will provide an assessment of the evolution in the distribution of the overall bulge - to - disk ratio of early - type cluster galaxies from the present day to redshifts @xmath19 .",
    "we will discuss how we compiled our samples of early - type cluster galaxies with morphological classifications in  [ sample ] , and then how we measured their total magnitudes , colors , and ellipticities in  [ data ] .",
    "one of the advantages of our approach of using an automated measurement technique is that we can simulate the measurement process .",
    "we discuss this in  [ ellmeas ] and in appendix a1 . from our measurements ,",
    "we find no evolution in the distribution of ellipticities of cluster early - type galaxies , which we show in  [ elldist ] . in  [ disc ]",
    ", we discuss the implications of this result and contrast with previous measurements of the evolution in the overall distribution of the bulge - to - disk ratio of cluster early - type galaxy population .",

    "we find that our ellipticities are less round than those from @xcite .",
    "we hypothesize that this comes about for two reasons .",

    "[ e_comp ] , to those from fitting models to the galaxies . as we see in fig.[e_comp ] , the luminosity - weighted moment estimates are generally rounder than the ones measured by galfit model fitting , despite the higher resolution and better sampling of acs as compared with wfpc2 .",
    "this figure shows that modeling the psf when measuring the ellipticity is particularly important for deriving a robust estimate of the underlying value , and that the resolution of the instrument is a lesser factor ( at least in this case between wfpc2 and acs ) . as in fig .",

    "these are images of real galaxies that have been redshifted and to which we have added noise . as with the previous plots showing trends in the data , the simulated galaxies are measured to be rounder with sextractor than by fitting models using galfit .",

    "<S> we have compiled a sample of early - type cluster galaxies from @xmath0 and measured the evolution of their ellipticity distributions . </S>",
    "<S> our sample contains 487  galaxies in 17 @xmath1 clusters with high - quality space - based imaging and a comparable sample of 210  galaxies in 10 clusters at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we select early - type galaxies ( elliptical and s0 galaxies ) that fall within the cluster @xmath3 , and which lie on the red - sequence in the magnitude range @xmath4 , after correcting for luminosity evolution as measured by the fundamental plane . </S>",
    "<S> our ellipticity measurements are made in a consistent manner over our whole sample . </S>",
    "<S> we perform extensive simulations to quantify the systematic and statistical errors , and find that it is crucial to use point - spread function ( psf)-corrected model fits ; determinations of the ellipticity from _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) image data that do not account for the psf `` blurring '' are systematically and significantly biased to rounder ellipticities at redshifts @xmath1 . we find that neither the median ellipticity , nor the shape of the ellipticity distribution of cluster early - type galaxies evolves with redshift from @xmath5 to @xmath6 ( i.e. , over the last @xmath7gyr ) . </S>",
    "<S> the median ellipticity at @xmath1 is statistically identical with that at @xmath2 , being higher by only 0.01 @xmath8 0.02 or 3 @xmath8 6% , while the distribution of ellipticities at @xmath1 agrees with the shape of the @xmath2 distribution at the 1 - 2% level ( i.e. , the probability that they are drawn from the same distribution is 98 - 99% ) . </S>",
    "<S> these results are strongly suggestive of an unchanging overall bulge - to - disk ratio distribution for cluster early - type galaxies over the last @xmath7gyr from @xmath9 to @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this result contrasts with that from visual classifications which show that the fraction of morphologically - selected disk - dominated early - type galaxies , or s0s , is significantly lower at @xmath11 than at @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the median disk - dominated early - type , or s0 , galaxy has a somewhat higher ellipticity at @xmath1 , suggesting that rounder s0s are being assigned as ellipticals . </S>",
    "<S> taking the ellipticity measurements and assuming , as in all previous studies , that the intrinsic ellipticity distribution of both elliptical and s0 galaxies remains constant , then we conclude from the lack of evolution in the observed early - type ellipticity distribution that the relative fractions of ellipticals and s0s do not evolve from @xmath9 to @xmath12 for a red - sequence selected samples of galaxies in the cores of clusters of galaxies . </S>"
