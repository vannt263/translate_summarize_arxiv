    "in contrast , the spatial degrees of freedom ( transverse spatial modal profile ) of a photon has an infinite dimensional hilbert space .",
    "researchers are therefore focussing on the spatial modes of paraxial optical beams to increase the information capacity per photon . to this end ,",
    "the most commonly used basis is that of the laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) modes .",
    "+ it was shown that the lg modes are orbital angular momentum ( oam ) eigenstates of photons @xcite .",
    "each photon in such a beam carries an amount of oam equal to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the azimuthal index of the lg mode .",
    "oam is conserved in spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) ; this has been demonstrated both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the implication thereof is that a pair of down - converted photons are naturally entangled in terms of the oam eigenstates .",
    "although lg modes are also characterised by a radial index _",
    "p _ this is often set to zero as higher radial indices require complex amplitude modulation ( intensity masking ) @xcite , which results in the loss of optical power .",
    "+ by approximating the phase matching condition with a gaussian function , it was shown @xcite that the schmidt basis for the quantum state produced in spdc is the lg modes . without this approximation ,",
    "the lg modes are still close to being the schmidt basis @xcite .",
    "thus , the lg modes are not only entangled in the azimuthal index , but also in terms of the radial index . as the azimuthal component of lg modes is orthogonal in @xmath1 and oam",
    "is conserved in spdc , the exact schmidt basis for the down - converted quantum state would be a basis of oam eigenstates .",
    "high - dimensional entanglement is dependent on the number of usable oam modes in the state @xcite .",

    "+ the lg modes are not the only oam basis .",
    "higher - order bessel beams @xcite and bessel - gaussian ( bg ) beams @xcite also have helical wavefronts and carry oam .",
    "the spatial modal bases are related by unitary transformations such that the down - converted quantum states are also entangled in terms of the bg modes .",
    "the bg modes allow for additional control over quantum state preparation as they have a continuous radial scale parameter that distinguishes different modes , instead of a discrete radial index as in lg modes .",
    "+ oam entanglement in the bg basis has already been successfully demonstrated @xcite . in this paper",
    "we examine the methods in which oam entanglement may be measured in the bg basis .",
    "we introduce back - projection as a tool to study bg projective measurements , using two - photon geometric optics to predict the strength of the coincidence correlations .",
    "we also quantify the number of measurable oam modes by calculating the schmidt number , and demonstrate a clear dependence on the radial component .",

    "there has been a great deal of interest in mathematically determining a method to predict quantum correlations in particular reference to quantum communication and imaging @xcite .",
    "the measurable correlation of the entangled photons in a typical spdc experiment depends on the quality of state generation ( e.g. the range of oam states that spdc actually produces ) and the state detection ( e.g. the range of the oam states that can be detected by the measurement scheme ) .",
    "it is useful to isolate the effect of generation from detection , and vice versa .",
    "we are interested in investigating the quality of our detection system , and so to this end , we introduce a back - projection experiment inspired by the advanced - wave representation of klyshko @xcite .",
    "+ the klyshko picture is useful in assessing the conditional probability distribution the probability of detecting a photon at detector b given that another photon is detected at detector a. klyshko considered the field detected in arm a as propagating in reverse back to the crystal plane where it reflects off the crystal to propagate forward through the system to detector b. using this picture and geometrical optics arguments , the two - photon correlations measured in spdc can be predicted , as in the ghost imaging and two - photon optics experiments in @xcite .",
    "more than a theoretical tool , the klyshko picture can also be applied experimentally .",

    "this back - projected beam was reflected and propagated forward onto the components of the other arm and onto the other detector .",
    "the number of photons registered by this detector can be optimised to ensure the stringent alignment required by the system , and more importantly , can be used to predict the expected behaviour of the two - photon correlation . with these in mind",

    "must be made .",
    "these patterns should ensure the fundamental mode from fiber a is coupled into fiber b. to illustrate this , if a positive lens function is encoded onto slm a , a negative lens function must be encoded onto slm b to produce a gaussian mode which can only then be coupled into fiber b. this can be seen mathematically using abcd matrices @xcite : @xmath43 & = & \\begin{bmatrix } 1 & 0 \\\\ -1/f_{2 } & 1 \\end{bmatrix } \\begin{bmatrix } -1 & 0 \\\\ 1/f_{1 } & -1 \\end{bmatrix } \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } x_1 \\\\",

    "however , identical focal lengths result in a change in the angular position , producing a divergent beam at fiber b and thus reducing the coupling efficiency . in the context of the spatial modes , which we are trying to measure , maximum coupling of the light from fiber a to fiber b occurs when the transmission functions encoded on the slms are phase - conjugates of each other .",
    "oam entanglement is typically measured in the lg basis by encoding only the azimuthal phase term onto an slm , described by the transmission function : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the azimuthal angle .",
    "depending on the azimuthal index @xmath1 an incoming gaussian mode is transformed into an approximated lg mode carrying oam of @xmath0 per photon .",
