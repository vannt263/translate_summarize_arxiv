    "since the discovery in 1964 of @xmath0 violation in the kaon system  @xcite , @xmath0 violation has been observed also in the @xmath8 meson system  @xcite  @xcite . in the charm sector , @xmath0 violation has long been expected to be too small to be observed at precision available until recently when , the lhcb collaboration has reported a difference in direct @xmath0 asymmetries in @xmath3 and @xmath4 that is @xmath12 from the @xmath0 conserving hypothesis  @xcite . in  @xcite the standard model ( sm ) description of these decays using the same ckm paradigm that provides a rather satisfactory description of such decays of @xmath13 mesons is considered .",
    "since the lhcb result , a broader view of this paradigm that might accomodate the large asymmetry is examined in  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that , in order to understand the nature of in decays , measurements of weak phases in these decays are essential . in  @xcite , it is proposed that , as with decays , time - dependent cp asymmetries in decays may provide the most direct way to measure these phases . in this paper",
    ", we further examine the precision that might be anticipated in four experimental scenarios that are likely to be available over the coming decade to evaluate the rate of time - dependent @xmath0 asymmetries in @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the three proposed environments ( super@xmath8 , lhcb , belle ii ) .",
    "in the standard model ( sm ) , @xmath0 violation is described in terms of the complex phase appearing in cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "the matrix is a unitary @xmath14 matrix which provides a description of quark mixing in terms of the coupling strengths for up - to - down quark type transitions , and it may be written as    @xmath15    within this framework the probability to observe a transition between a quark @xmath16 to a quark @xmath17 is proportional to @xmath18 .      in ref .",
    "@xcite the ckm matrix has been written using the @xmath19 parametrisation  @xcite :    @xmath20/2 & 1 - \\lambda^2/ 2 - \\lambda^4(1 + 4a^2)/8 & a \\lambda^2",

    "the study of @xmath45 ( which should not be confused with the term @xmath46 appearing in the ckm matrix ) is able to probe the combination of @xmath0 violation due to mixing and decay , and this form of @xmath0 violation is referred to as @xmath0 violation in the interference between mixing and decay .",

    "one of the issues raised in  @xcite is the possibility to use different decay channels of the @xmath1 mesons to constrain the value of the angle @xmath2 of the @xmath59 triangle .",

    "the latter together with the different contribution to decay @xmath63 from @xmath64 topologies will introduce theoretical uncertainties , and for this reason we refer to the angle @xmath2 as @xmath10 where @xmath65 indicates that there are theoretical uncertainties that need to be evaluated . to evaluate the asymmetry , and estimate the precision on @xmath10 that one might achieve in the different experimental environments described in the previous section , we generate a set of one hundred monte carlo data samples .",

    "have been expressed as functions of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and the fit is performed keeping @xmath68 and allowing @xmath69 to vary .",
    "the same results are obtained when also @xmath66 is also allowed to vary in the fit .",
    "it is important to mention that a measurement of @xmath70 in an experiment would be a signature of @xmath0 violation  @xcite .",
    "the super@xmath8 collaboration is expected to start taking data in 2017  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite , and the integrated luminosity which will be achieved with the full program is expected to be @xmath71 . with this luminosity",
    "one would expect to reconstruct @xmath72 tagged @xmath73 events in a data sample of 75with a purity of 98%  @xcite .",
    "the results of the numerical analysis are shown in fig .",

    "the asymmetry parameters determined here have a precision of @xmath74 . the same procedure when applied to the @xmath60 channel to measure @xmath75 , for which one would expect to reconstruct @xmath76 events , leads to precision of @xmath77 .",
    "when the results from @xmath60 and @xmath61 are combined one obtains a precision in @xmath10 of @xmath78 .      the super@xmath8 collaboration is planning to have a dedicated run at the center of mass energy of the @xmath7 resonance , to collect an integrated luminosity of @xmath79 . with this luminosity",
    "one would expect to record  979000 @xmath73 reconstructed events , when the full set of semi - leptonic decays @xmath80 @xmath81 is used to tag the flavor of @xmath1 mesons ( with negligible mistag probability ) .",
    "the results of the numerical analysis are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3770 ] .    the phase @xmath82 could be measured with a precision of @xmath83 .",
    "one may also consider using hadronically tagged events , for example @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) , where @xmath86 is anything , which corresponds to 54% ( 3% ) of all @xmath1 meson decays from which one would expect @xmath87 , and that the asymmetry in particle identification of @xmath88 and @xmath89 in the detector will naturally lead to a small , but non - zero value of @xmath90 .",
    "we expect that there would be approximately 4.8 million kaon tagged @xmath73 events in 1.0 at charm threshold . using these data alone",
    ", one would be able to measure @xmath82 to a precision of @xmath91 . hence if one combines the results from semi - leptonic and kaon tagged events , a precision of @xmath92 is achievable .",
    "another possible scenario is that of measuring time - dependent asymmetries from uncorrelated @xmath40 mesons in a hadronic environment , in particular the lhcb experiment . here",
    "dilution and background effects will be larger than those at an @xmath93 machine , but the data are already available and it would be interesting to perform the time - dependent analysis , especially after the recent results on time integrated @xmath0 violation in ref .  @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned a measurement of @xmath94 will signify @xmath0 violation .",
    "given that the measurement of @xmath45 is likely expected to be dominated by uncertainties , especially in @xmath51 and @xmath95 , it is not clear what the ultimate precision obtained from lhcb will be .",
    "the best way to ascertain this would be to perform the measurement on the existing data set .",
    "we have estimated that lhcb will collect @xmath96 @xmath97 tagged @xmath63 decays in 5of data , based on the 0.62of data shown in  @xcite , and we consider also the outcome of a measurement for 1.1(equivalent to @xmath98 @xmath97 tagged @xmath63 decays ) already available after the 2011 lhc run . in  @xcite we estimate a purity of @xmath99 and @xmath100 which results in the asymmetry obtained in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc ] for 5of data .",
    "this fit is translated into a potential measurement of the phase @xmath82 with a precision of @xmath101 . with 1.1of data we estimate that lhcb may be able to reach a precision of @xmath102 on @xmath82 .",
    "the last scenario considered here is that of belle ii with 50of data collected at the center of mass energy of the @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "we have considered the same efficiency and mistag probability as for super@xmath8 and we expect that @xmath103 @xmath97 tagged @xmath63 will be collected .",
    "the resulting asymmetry is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : belle ] .    the precision on @xmath82 obtained for this scenario is estimated to be @xmath104 .",
    "we consider the same data sample discussed in the previous sections for @xmath61 and @xmath60 .",
    "while we find that results from the time - dependent analysis are not sensitive to the parameter @xmath57 , and that with 1.0 of data collected at charm threshold at super@xmath8 it will be possible to improve the currently known precision on @xmath6 by a factor of two with respect to the most recent hfag values  @xcite .",

    "this paper elucidates the time - dependent analysis of the @xmath1 mesons discussed in ref .",
    "we concentrated on the possible measurement of the @xmath10 angle of the charm unitarity triangle , on the mixing phase @xmath5 and on the mixing parameters .",
    "we estimate our results and compare them for the experimental environments that we think could and should perform this analysis : super@xmath8 , lhcb and belle ii .",
    "we found that super@xmath8 may perform better this analysis , but time is required before the collaboration will start data taking .",
    "lhcb will have to control the background levels to perform this measurement resulting then in a challenging analysis .",
    "however as referred to in the article the lhcb collaboration has already available an amount of data to analyse .",
    "this same amount of data has already shown a first hint of direct @xmath0 violation in charm , we think it would be worth go through the time - dependent formalism .",
