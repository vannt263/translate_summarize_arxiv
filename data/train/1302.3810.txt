    "the latter are found to be @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) meaning that , except the sb situation , the eigenmodes have different decay rates .",

    "this mode dissipating most slowly , @xmath20 @xmath21 , is found either for cb or lb .",

    "at the microscopic level , quantum fluctuations also oscillate in time ( even for initial vacuum states for which first order moments vanish at any time ) .",
    "this collective periodic motion is associated to a slow energy decay and witnesses the presence of robust quantum correlations against decoherence @xcite .",
    "our approach points to a wide range of appealing possibilities in quantum networks . in the following",
    "we show how a whole random network ( or a part of it ) can be brought to a synchronized state retaining quantum correlations via local tuning of just one of the nodes , or how two external oscillators can be linked to a random network leading to their entanglement and locked oscillations .",
    "let us consider an erds - rnyi random and dissipative network @xcite of oscillators with different node frequencies , links and weights ( fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] ) focusing on the relaxation dynamics of energy and quantum correlations .",
    "the node dynamics is mostly incoherent and even if initializing the network in a non - classical state , quantum correlations generally disappear due to decoherence @xcite . independently on the form of the network , for dissipation in sb , all nodes thermalize on a time scale",

    ", even maintaining fixed the rest of the network frequencies @xmath36 and its topology ( @xmath37 couplings ) it is possible to decrease the weakest coupling @xmath17 .",
    "this means that an extra oscillator of properly selected frequency @xmath36 ( like a synchronizer ) can be added to a random network , even if weakly coupled , and it will lead to a collective synchronization of the whole system at some frequency ( @xmath38 ) , generally different from @xmath35 .",
    "[ fig_3 ] displays the average global synchronization and quantum correlations established in the network .",
    "synchronization arises after a transient across the whole network by tuning one of the frequencies @xmath35 to a particular value @xmath39 , while it is not present when moving a few percent away from this value .",
    "equivalently one could have tuned one of the couplings @xmath40 . in the following we consider separately the case in which @xmath17 is significantly smaller than the other effective couplings and the case in which it vanishes .",
    "conditions for global synchronization follow from small ratio between the damping rates of the two slowest normal modes @xmath41 .",
    "interestingly , this is a necessary but not sufficient condition for @xmath42 synchronization .",
    "this is due to the fact that the presence of a slowly dissipating normal mode into the system needs to be accompanied by a significant overlap between this mode ( @xmath43 ) , or virtual oscillator , and all the real ones ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "an analytical estimation of the synchronization time is found taking into account both the importance ( overlap with individual oscillator ) and decay of few normal modes in the system .",

    "collective synchronization time corresponds to @xmath48 , i.e. when even the last oscillator joins the synchronous dynamics dominated by the less damped mode .",
    "then phase - locking in the evolution of all oscillators , namely in their ( all order ) moments , can arise before thermalization , when there is significant separation between largest time decays @xmath49 , and overlap between slowest normal modes and each system node .",

    "[ fig_3],width=302 ]    we now look at the quantumness of the state in presence of collective synchronization .",
    "generally decoherence is independent on the specific features such as the oscillation frequency in a system @xcite .",
    "still , synchronization is a consequence of a reduced dissipation in some system mode and indeed witnesses the robustness of quantum correlations , as evident form the average discord @xmath53 in the network represented in fig.[fig_3]b . after a transient dynamics in which the couplings in the network create quantum correlations @xcite , even when starting from separable states , discord does actually decay to small values for @xmath35 different from @xmath39 ( non - synchronized network ) while it maintains large values for the case of a properly tuned node ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the case @xmath67 , leading to @xmath68 , needs special attention . after a transient",
    "all the nodes will oscillate at a locked common frequency , the one of the undamped normal mode @xmath38 , which we call a _",
    "frozen _ mode .",
    "as before ( eq . ) , the possibility to synchronize the whole network also requires a second condition , namely that the undamped mode involves all the network nodes .",
    "( the case in which the latter condition applies only to some nodes is discussed below . )",
    "when both the conditions @xmath69 are met , there is a frozen normal mode linking all oscillators .",
    "this leads to collective synchronization in the whole network and allows for mutual information and quantum correlations remaining strong even asymptotically , being orders of magnitude larger than for the fully thermalized state , when synchronization is not present ( fig.[fig_3 ] ) .",
    "the undamped mode gives actually rise to a decoherence - free dynamics for the whole system of oscillators where quantum correlations and mutual information survive .",
    "the phenomena above are found for nodes dissipating at equal rates into a cb , while in the presence of @xmath0 independent environments ( sb ) all oscillators thermalize incoherently , synchronization is not found , and decoherence times for all oscillators are of the same order . as a final observation we mention the special case in which the center of mass of the system is one of the normal modes ; then there will be a large decoherence - free subspace ( corresponding to the other @xmath70 modes ) but no synchronization will appear for a cb .",
    "common and separate baths correspond to two extreme situations in which all oscillators have equivalent interactions with the environment(s ) .",
    "we now consider the case of a local bath , as a limit case in which one oscillator is dissipating stronger , fig.[fig_1]c .",
    "a frozen normal mode @xmath22 must not overlap with the dissipative oscillator ( labeled by @xmath11 ) while involving all the other nodes ( @xmath71 @xmath72 ) . then , synchronization of the whole network ( except for the dissipative oscillator ) arises .",
    "this occurs when @xmath73 meaning that the undamped mode @xmath74 involves a cluster of oscillators not including the lossy one .",
    "we find synchronization and robust quantum effects across the network as for cb , with the difference that for lb the dissipating node is now excluded ( further details are discussed in si ) .",
    "the possibility to synchronize a whole network , in presence of different dissipation mechanisms , just by tuning one local parameter opens - up the perspective of control that can be explored considering the dynamical variation of a control - node frequency .",
    "in particular we find similar qualitative results both for random networks and for disordered lattices consisting of regular networks with inhomogeneous frequencies and couplings , being the latter largely studied in ultracold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "local tuning to collective synchronization is not only a general feature of different kind of networks but can also be established in motifs within the network .",
    "as we show in the following , the system can be tuned to a partial synchronization , involving some nodes of a network independently of the rest of it . indeed ,",
    "even if the whole system is coupled to a cb , we can identify the conditions for having a synchronized cluster , like the 3-node linear motif in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] .",
    "two non - directly linked nodes @xmath75 and @xmath76 of the motif are then asymptotically synchronized through another one , here @xmath77 , and this leads to a common oscillation dynamics along the whole motif @xmath75-@xmath77-@xmath76 . the condition for synchronization of a cluster , namely its dependence on a frozen normal mode , reads @xmath78 with @xmath38 frequency of the frozen mode ( see details in si ) .     and ( b ) average discord",
    "@xmath79 evaluated for linear 3-node motifs ( hence the subindex @xmath80 ) in a random network ( connection probability @xmath55 ) of @xmath81 oscillators ( shown in c ) . a tuned non - dissipative motif @xmath82 composed by the three nodes @xmath83",
    "is compared with another equivalent non - tuned motif @xmath84 composed by nodes @xmath85 .",
    "frequencies in the network are sampled from a uniform distribution from @xmath86 to @xmath87 , and couplings with a gaussian distribution around @xmath59 with standard deviation @xmath88 . in order to avoid dissipation in the @xmath83 motif we have set @xmath89 , being @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "time units such that @xmath64.[figure4],width=302 ]    this case is an example of the general result stating that given any network , a part of it ( in our case a linear motif , @xmath82 ) can be synchronized by tuning one of its components , for instance a frequency or coupling of the motif .",
    "a key point is that this is independent of the frequencies and links of the rest of the network , provided the motif is properly embedded in the network .",
    "the links between @xmath82 and the rest of the network should satisfy @xmath92 this is equivalent to saying that a synchronized motif with robust quantum correlations can preserve these features when linked to an @xmath93 network , if some constraints on the reciprocal links are satisfied .",
    "for instance , each node of the synchronized motif needs to share with the rest of the network more than one link . in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] we compare the behavior of two linear motifs of a large network , where a first motif @xmath82 is synchronized , satisfying eqs.- while the second one @xmath84 is not . after a transient",
    "a frozen mode tames the dynamics of @xmath82 , which then shows a synchronous evolution and robust correlations .",
    "it can also be shown that quantum purity and energy reach higher values of a stationary non - thermal state .",
    "this is compared with the non - synchronized motif @xmath84 whose dynamics quickly relaxes to a thermal state .",
    "the case of a three oscillator chain is an example showing the possibility to tune synchronization and quantum effects in a motif within the network when the proper link conditions are satisfied .",
    "the same technique discussed in the previous section can be applied to the case in which we aim to synchronize few , even if not directly connected , elements of a network .",
    "but this does not mean that any set of nodes can be synchronized asymptotically .",
    "in fact , we find that for a cb we can only synchronize two different and not directly linked ( @xmath94 ) oscillators if we synchronize with them also other intermediate linked elements ( like in the linear motif example , fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ) or when these two oscillators are identical , like we discuss in the present section .",
    "( we call these nodes @xmath75 and @xmath76 and are plotted in red in the network displayed in panel ( c ) ) .",
    "the network is a random one ( connection probability @xmath55 of 15 oscillators and same frequency and couplings distribution as in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] .",
    "we compare the situations in which the couplings from the red nodes to the rest of the network ( they are directly connected to other nodes called @xmath77 and @xmath11 ) are properly balanced in order to avoid dissipation @xmath95 and @xmath96 with the case when this balance is perturbed @xmath97 and @xmath98 .the third line in panel ( b ) shows the entanglement between other two arbitrary oscillators in the situation in which @xmath75 and @xmath76 are balanced .",
    "time units such that @xmath64 [ figure5],width=302 ]    we consider the case of two identical oscillators ( i.e. with @xmath99 ) prepared in a separable state , with some local squeezing .",
    "they are not directly coupled ( @xmath94 ) but are connected through an arbitrary network . in general",
    "they will dissipate reaching the thermal state , but with the proper conditions we find an important result : because their frequencies are identical it is possible to construct a frozen normal mode involving only these two nodes , given by @xmath100 with @xmath101 and this can be obtained , for instance , by properly attaching them to the network . in other words , by tuning their couplings to the network it is possible to have both oscillators relaxing onto a frozen mode , so that they will be synchronized and will keep a higher energy than otherwise .",
    "most importantly , in this case entanglement can actually be generated between oscillators initially in a separable state and remains high asymptotically .    in order to entangle the oscillators , their coupling to the rest of the network needs to fulfill the condition @xmath102 ( similar to eq . ) , achieved by proper tuning of coupling strengths of the active links ( @xmath45 ) with the rest of the network @xmath103 . in fig .",
    "[ figure5]a and b we show the evolution of energy and entanglement of the oscillators @xmath75 and @xmath76 when linked to a random network . as we see in fig .",
    "[ figure5]c there is not direct link between @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( @xmath94 ) and the whole system dissipates in a common environment .",
    "the case where the oscillators @xmath75 and @xmath76 are coupled to the network following the prescription is compared to another case in which their links are not properly balanced ( we slightly change the coupling strengths ) .",
    "both energy and entanglement are shown to be sensitive to the structure of the reciprocal links and the possibility to actually bring the added nodes into an entangled state that will survive asymptotically is guaranteed by eq . .",
    "the importance of this result is twofold : in terms of applications it shows that it is possible to dynamically generate entanglement between two non - linked nodes embedded in a random network by tuning their connections to it , and on the other hand it enlarges the scenario for asymptotic entanglement generation through the environment .",
    "it is known that large entanglement can be generated between far oscillators during a transient due to a sudden - switch @xcite or through parametric driving @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", a common environment leads to entanglement between a pair of spins @xcite or oscillators @xcite .",
    "our results on synchronization in dissipative harmonic networks and its optimization give a flavor of all the possibilities that show up once the mechanism behind the phenomenon is understood . at difference from widely considered self - sustained non - linear oscillators , here",
    "we focus in a linear system showing how synchronization can emerge after a transient for dissipation processes introducing inhomogeneous decay rates among the systems normal modes .",
    "a synchronous oscillation is predicted , for the first time , either in a long transient during relaxation to the equilibrium state or in a stationary non - thermal state .",
    "we considered the most significant examples of correlation length of the bath larger than the system size ( cb ) and of a node of the network more strongly exposed to dissipation ( lb ) , displaying synchronous dynamics . on the other hand , for independent environments ( sb ) on different nodes the resulting dynamics remains incoherent even when increasing the strength of the reciprocal couplings in the network .    the presence of synchronization in the whole or a part of the network witnesses the survival of quantum correlations and entanglement between the involved nodes .",
    "this connection between a coherent oscillation in the network and its non - classical state is a powerful result in the context of complex quantum systems , considering the abundance of this phenomenon .",
    "indeed , the condition underlying synchronization provides a strategy to protect a system subspace from decoherence .",
    "our discussion and methodological approach are general , but we show specific consequences of our analysis , such as global or partial synchronization in a network through local tuning in one node ( synchronizer ) as well as the possibility of connecting two nodes ( not linked between them ) to a network and synchronize and entangle them , even starting from separable states . even if the reported results refer to random networks , our analysis applies to generic ones , also including homogeneous and disordered lattices and do not require all - to - all connectivity .    in some sense , tuning part of a network so that the rest of it reaches a synchronous , highly correlated state can be seen as a kind of reservoir engineering , where here the tuned part of the network would be a part of the reservoir .",
    "this is to be compared with recent proposals of dissipative engineering for quantum information , where special actions are performed to target a desired non - classical state @xcite . in the context of quantum communications and considering recent results on quantum internet @xcite ,",
    "our study can offer some insight in designing a network with coherent information transport properties .",
    "furthermore implications of our approach can be explored in the context of efficient transport in biological systems @xcite .",
    "an interesting methodological connection is also with transport through ( classical ) random networks @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", our analysis , when restricted to the classical limit , also gives some insight about vibrations in an engineering context , providing the conditions for undamped normal modes and their effect @xcite .",

    "<S> several examples @xcite have shown that we may have to consider quantum dynamics to explain biological phenomena .    </S>",
    "<S> a first step to characterize quantum spontaneous synchronization , considering quantum fluctuations and correlations beyond the classical limit , has been taken in ref.@xcite where synchronization between one pair of damped quantum harmonic oscillators has been reported . </S>",
    "<S> most of the classical literature deals with self - sustained phase oscillators modeled by kuramoto - type models , or with identical nonlinear oscillators studied through the master stability formalism @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> when several dissipative quantum oscillators coupled in a network are considered dissipation can act globally or locally ( in a node ) and , depending on the correlation length in the bath with respect to the size of the system , a variety of surprising phenomena are observed . in this work we show how synchronization can actually be induced by local tuning of one ( even newly attached ) oscillator of a generic ( regular or random ) network . </S>",
    "<S> synchronous behavior emerges in the whole network or in a part of it and witnesses robust quantum correlations and entanglement . stemming both from the structure of the system and from the form of system - bath coupling </S>",

    "<S> the form in which dissipation occurs in a spatially extended system has deep consequences . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the importance of symmetries present in the system - bath coupling has been recognized in many contexts . in classical systems , this fundamental issue was already discussed in the seminal work of lord rayleigh analyzing damping effects on normal modes in vibrating systems @xcite . </S>",
