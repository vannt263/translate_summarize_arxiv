    "@xcite in the search for alternative phosphors with the best efficiencies and tailored color - rendering indexes , doping  in other artificial garnets has been a line of work .",
    "it led , for instance , to the discoveries of the :  orange phosphor  @xcite and the :  green phosphor .",
    "@xcite    most garnets can be described in terms of a 160 atom body - centered cubic unit cell ( 80 atom primitive cell ) of the @xmath6 ( 230 ) space group , which contains eight formula units of a@xmath7b@xmath8b@xmath9o@xmath10 .",
    "a , b@xmath11 and b@xmath12 are cations of different nominal charges in different symmetry sites . in , for instance ,",

    "@xcite optically active  impurities substitute for a atoms at ( c ) sites , which have the local symmetry of the @xmath2 point group and a first coordination shell made of 8 oxygen atoms .",
    "the energies of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 levels of  in particular garnets and in other oxides depend on the bonding and electrostatic interactions between ce and the hosts , and they can be calculated in a one - by - one basis , with reasonable accuracy , by means of  methods , both in @xmath2 local symmetry like in ce - doped yag  @xcite and in lower local symmetries like in ce , la - doped yag  @xcite and ce , ga - doped yag .",
    "@xcite these energies are dominated , up to first - order , by the bonding interactions between ce and its first oxygen coordination shell , subject to the basic confinement embedding effects of the host .",
    "other specific host embedding effects are important at higher orders of approximation and they refine the results .",
    "this paper is aimed at providing a basic study of the energies of the levels of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 manifolds of  in @xmath2 8-fold oxygen coordination .",
    "we report the results of an  calculation of them after consideration of the bonding interactions with the first oxygen coordination shell only , under the effects of a cubic , non host specific , confinement embedding potential .",
    "the present results are a common reference for these levels of  in specific garnets ( and other oxides with 8-fold coordination ) , since the latter can be considered as resulting from the former after including the host specific embedding effects .",
    "in order to know the @xmath17 and @xmath18 energy levels of under the effects of its interactions with a coordination shell of eight oxygens in a @xmath2 symmetry site of a solid oxide , we calculated the corresponding energy levels of the  cluster embedded in a @xmath19 host potential .",
    "we will describe later the details of the  wave function based quantum mechanical calculation .",
    "with he choice of a cubic host embedding potential , all the energy splittings and changes due to @xmath2 distortions are ascribable to the interactions between ce and the first - shell o atoms .",
    "it is convenient to look at the @xmath2 energy levels as derived from the more familiar @xmath19 levels after geometry distortions and this is what we did in this work . in consequence with this",
    ", we decided to take a cubic ceo@xmath3 @xmath19 moiety as a reference and to chose six atomic displacement coordinates @xmath20 that transform according to irreducible representations of the @xmath19 point symmetry group for the six degrees of freedom of the ceo@xmath3 @xmath2 moiety .",
    "they are defined in table  [ tab : s1-s6 ] and represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : s1-s6 ] .",
    "@xmath21 represents the breathing ( or symmetric bond stretching ) of the reference cube and it transforms according to the totally symmetric irreducible representation @xmath22 ; @xmath23 represents an asymmetric bond stretching of the crosses @xmath24 and @xmath25 and it transforms according to the @xmath26 sub - especies of the doubly degenerate @xmath27 irreducible representation ;  @xcite @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the @xmath30 and @xmath26 symmetric and asymmetric bond bendings of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 crosses ; and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the @xmath35 and @xmath36 symmetric and asymmetric twistings of the crosses .",
    "the details of the quantum mechanical calculation are the following .",
    "we performed  calculations on a   cluster that include ce - o bonding effects , static and dynamic electron correlation effects , scalar and spin - orbit coupling relativistic effects , and cubic host embedding effects .",
    "for each @xmath2 nuclear configuration of the  embedded cluster , we performed , in a first step , scalar relativistic calculations with the many - electron second - order douglas - kroll - hess ( dkh ) hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite these were state - average complete - active - space self - consistent - field  @xcite ( sa - casscf ) calculations with the active space that results from distributing the open - shell electron in 13 active molecular orbitals with main character ce @xmath37 , which provided occupied and empty molecular orbitals to feed subsequent multi - state second - order perturbation theory calculations ( ms - caspt2 ) ,  @xcite where the dynamic correlation of 73 electrons ( the @xmath38 electrons of ce and @xmath39 electrons of the o atoms ) were taken into account . in a second step ,",
    "spin - orbit coupling effects were included by adding the amfi approximation of the dkh spin - orbit coupling operator  @xcite to the hamiltonian and performing restricted - active - space state - interaction spin - orbit calculations ( rassi - so )  @xcite with the previously computed sa - casscf wave functions and ms - caspt2 energies .    in all these calculations ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the   cluster is supplemented with a cubic embedding hamiltonian . for this we chose the  model potential embedding hamiltonian ( aimp )  @xcite of a sro host with cscl lattice structure ( @xmath40 , no .",
    "221 ) , which provides a perfect 8-fold cubic oxide coordination of the cationic site .",
    "we used a lattice constant @xmath41  2.87    ( the one that gives a ce - o equilibrium distance in the cubic  embedded cluster of 2.34    at the ms - caspt2 level of calculation , which is the ce - o distance of the reference ceo@xmath3 cube in an hypothetical undistorted ce - doped yag  @xcite ) .",
    "the embedding potential of this 8-fold coordinated cubic oxide was computed in hartree - fock self - consistent embedded - ions calculations ( scei ) ,  @xcite in which the input embedding aimps used for the sr@xmath42 and o@xmath43 ions of sro are consistent with the output aimps obtained out of the hf orbitals of the embedded sr@xmath42 and o@xmath43 ions .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath44 and @xmath4 transitions on the @xmath2 distortions of the first coordination shell are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s135s246-spinfree ] without spin - orbit coupling and in fig .",
    "[ fig : s135s246-spinorbit ] with spin - orbit coupling interactions included .",
    "the chosen ranges of the @xmath20 coordinates span their usual values in natural and artificial garnets , which are shown in table  [ tab : garnets ] and in the figures . besides the transitions ,",
    "the figures include two additional lines : one is the difference between the @xmath1 and @xmath0 energy centroids ( or average energies of the five @xmath18 levels and the seven @xmath17 levels ) , @xmath45 ; the other is the difference between the ligand field stabilization energies of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 lowest levels @xmath46 - [ e_{centroid}(4f^1 ) - e_1(4f^1 ) ] $ ] .",
    "the fact that the lowest @xmath4 transition equals their subtraction , @xmath47 , has been used to analyze the reasons behind red and blue shifts of this transition .",
    "@xcite    let us first focus on the lowest @xmath4 transition , whose reverse is the luminescence of  in garnets and other oxides .",
    "it is clear that only two coordinates have an important impact on it : the breathing mode @xmath21 , which does not distort the cubic symmetry , and the symmetric bond bending mode @xmath28 , which gives a @xmath48 tetragonal distortion of the ceo@xmath3 cube .",
    "symmetric compression of the ce - o bonds lowers the @xmath4 transition .",
    "this is almost entirely due to the increase of the @xmath1 ligand field it produces , which lowers the first @xmath18 level with respect to its centroid .",
    "this effect is slightly compensated with a small increase due to the centroids : bond compression slightly shifts the @xmath1 centroid upwards with respect to the @xmath0 centroid . the latter observation has been made before  @xcite and it contradicts the predictions of the usual model for the centroid energy difference ,  @xcite according to which it should be smaller for smaller bond lengths ; nevertheless , the model has been useful to rationalize @xmath5 luminescences .",
    "@xcite the contribution of the breathing mode @xmath21 to the lowest @xmath4 transition represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : s135s246-spinorbit ] fits @xmath49 ; for cubic ceo@xmath3 moieties @xmath50 , @xmath51 being the ce - o bond length change with respect to the reference cube ; in our case the reference cube has ce - o bond length of 2.34    and a lowest @xmath4 transition of 26000  1 .",
    "symmetric bond bending along the @xmath28 coordinate lowers de @xmath4 transition . among the @xmath2 distortions of the cube",
    ", it is the only tetragonal one . also , it is the only one with a significant impact on the transition ( for the ranges of @xmath52 shown by garnets ) .",
    "the enhancement of tetragonal distortions of the cube as responsible for the red - shifts of the luminescence has been suggested by cheetham and coworkers  @xcite and it is supported by the present investigation .",
    "the image emerging from an analysis in terms of configurational energy centroids and ligand field stabilization is one in which the lowering of the first @xmath18 level with respect to the ground state is due in almost equal amounts to an increase of the ligand field ( of its tetragonal component ) and to a reduction of the centroid energy difference .",
    "again , the latter effect contradicts the prediction of the judd - morrison model : a very small increase of the centroid energy difference out of a very small increase of the ce - o distances .",
    "the contribution of the tetragonal mode @xmath28 to the lowest @xmath4 transition represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : s135s246-spinorbit ] fits @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "this contribution is due in almost equal amounts to the lowering of the centroid energy difference and the increasing of the ligand field .",
    "the centroid effect fits @xmath57 for @xmath54 and @xmath58 for @xmath56 ; the ligand field effect fits @xmath59 for @xmath54 and @xmath60 for @xmath56 .",
    "apart from @xmath21 and @xmath28 , only the asymmetric stretching @xmath23 has an effect , although very small , on the first @xmath4 transition ( it fits @xmath61 in the range of the figures ) .    regarding higher @xmath4 transitions ,",
    "several remarks can be made from figs .",
    "[ fig : s135s246-spinfree ] and [ fig : s135s246-spinorbit ] .",
    "the gap between the first and the second @xmath1 levels related with the cubic @xmath62 is due to the symmetric bending @xmath28 and to the symmetric twisting @xmath33 , with a significantly higher contribution from the latter in garnets ; however , different splittings in different garnets would be due to @xmath28 .",
    "the splitting of the three upper levels , mostly related with the cubic @xmath63 , comes basically from the symmetric bending @xmath28 and the asymmetric stretching @xmath23 , with a small contribution from the symmetric twisting @xmath33 and negligible contributions from the asymmetric bending and twisting @xmath29 and @xmath34 .",
    "the larger @xmath21 and the absolute values of @xmath23 and @xmath28 , the higher probability for the third @xmath1 level to appear below the conduction band of the garnet .",
    "finally , the @xmath0 levels are shown with more detail in figs .",
    "[ fig : s135s246-spinfree-4f ] and [ fig : s135s246-spinorbit-4f ] , without and with spin - orbit coupling respectively .",
    "these may be interesting because the @xmath5 emission is made of the superposition of the seven individual emissions and the full with and shape of the emission band depends , although not only , on the relative positions of the @xmath0 levels . since the emission to the highest @xmath0 level has a minor contribution to the full emission band shape ,  @xcite we can have a predictive hint by looking at the six lowest @xmath0 levels . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : s135s246-spinorbit-4f ] , the width seems to be controlled by @xmath23 and @xmath28 , so that the garnets with higher absolute values of these two coordinates would tend to have wider emission bands because of their higher @xmath0 level separation .",
    "of course , the width of each individual @xmath5 emission will depend on the @xmath1 and @xmath0 equilibrium offsets .",
    "the levels of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 manifolds of  in @xmath2 8-fold oxygen coordination have been calculated  as a function of @xmath2 deformation coordinates of a reference cube , with the goal of pinpointing the effects of the geometry of the first coordination shell . a  cluster under the effects of a confinement aimp embedding potential of cubic symmetry has been used at a level of calculation all - electron dkh for the hamiltonian and sa - casscf / ms - castp2/rassi - so for the wave functions .",
    "the results include bonding , correlation , scalar relativistic , spin - orbit coupling , and embedding interactions .",
    "it is found that the lowest @xmath4 transition shifts significantly to the red only as a consequence of symmetric ce - o bond compression and tetragonal symmetric bond bending .",
    "the increase of the @xmath1 cubic ligand field dominates the effects of the bond compression , whereas the effect of the tetragonal bond bending distortion is divided in almost equal amounts between an increase of the @xmath1 tetragonal ligand field and a reduction of the energy difference between the @xmath1 and @xmath0 energy centroids .",
    "the splittings of the upper @xmath1 levels and of the @xmath0 levels have also been studied .",
