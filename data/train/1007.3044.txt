    "for numerous biological processes@xcite and emerging technologies@xcite , complexation between oppositely charged polyelectrolytes@xcite is the underlying fundamental phenomenon .",
    "however , our understanding of how the electrostatic attraction between opposite charges on the polyelectrolytes is coupled with the conformational characteristics of polyelectrolyte chains is very limited .",
    "motivated by a plethora of relevant biological processes and the impetus for developing advanced technologies such as underwater adhesives@xcite and biosensors@xcite , extensive experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite work has been carried out to understand the mechanisms of polyelectrolyte charge complexation .",
    "a few insights into the origin of polyelectrolyte complexation have been provided by simulations .",
    "langevin dynamics simulations@xcite of two oppositely charged polyelectrolyte chains have revealed that the entropy of counterion release is the predominant driving force for complexation in highly charged polyelectrolytes .",
    "in contrast , the simulations show that direct electrostatic attractions drive the association of two weakly charged polyelectrolytes whose counterions are not condensed onto the chains .",
    "such simulations involving only a single pair of polymers are of course relevant only to extremely dilute solutions of polyelectrolytes and are only suggestive of complexation phenomena at finite concentrations . at such higher concentrations , complexation between oppositely charged polyelectrolytes",
    "has the character of a phase separation process in which a supernatant phase that is extremely dilute in polymer macroscopically separates from a polyelectrolyte rich phase that is either a fluid ( `` complex coacervate '' ) or a solid ( `` precipitate '' ) . in this paper",
    "we shall be exclusively concerned with systems that produce fluid - like polyelectrolyte complexes properly classified as complex coacervates.@xciteextending conventional langevin , monte - carlo , or molecular dynamics particle - based simulations to polyelectrolyte mixtures at finite concentrations has been hindered by the need for extremely large computational resources to address the long - range character of the electrostatic interactions and the inherently slow kinetics of the dense coacervate phase and phase separation process .",
    "development of a theory to study the phase separation in a mixture of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes is a daunting problem due to the non - trivial coupling between long range effects such as electrostatics and chain connectivity , and short range excluded volume interactions .",
    "the theoretical treatment is further complicated by the inevitable need to include electrostatic screening and correlation effects in the theory , analogous to the classical debye - hckel theory of electrolyte solutions , to capture the electrostatic forces that drive phase separation .",
    "this is the reason behind the inability of the self - consistent field theory ( scft ) , a type of mean - field theory , to capture even the signature of a phase separation@xcite . in other words , in a field - theoretic description of a mixed polyelectrolyte system , one needs to go beyond the mean - field or `` saddle - point '' approximation in order to study phase separation phenomena .",
    "typically , the random phase approximation@xcite is used to compute the leading correction to the saddle - point results . in the case of flexible polyelectrolytes@xcite",
    ", it can be shown rigorously that the random phase approximation is valid in the dual limit of high monomer densities and low small ion densities .",
    "physically , such a situation is realized in concentrated solutions of weakly charged polyelectrolytes .",
    "more sophisticated field - theoretic results beyond the random phase approximation have also been obtained ( including a phase diagram ) for a particular model of flexible polyelectrolyte mixtures using the self - consistent one - loop ( hartree ) approximation@xcite .",
    "most recently , direct numerical simulations of a related field theory model ( so - called `` field - theoretic simulations '' ) have been carried out@xcite to capture the effects of fluctuations and correlations to all orders , without invoking any approximation .",
    "an important result that came out of these simulations of flexible polyelectrolyte mixtures is that the phase boundaries in the concentrated regime are accurately predicted by the random phase approximation . in this work",
    ", we consider solutions containing _ binary mixtures _ of oppositely charged rodlike polyelectrolytes and study their phase behavior using the random phase approximation , which , as noted above , has been previously shown to provide an accurate description of complexation phenomena in flexible polyelectrolyte mixtures . an important focus of our study is a comparison of the phase behavior of rodlike and flexible polyelectrolyte mixtures .",
    "the rodlike system is particularly relevant to a recently developed biosensor technology@xcite involving complexation of cationic conjugated polyelectrolytes with anionic dna .",
    "a fundamental question that we have tried to answer is : what is the role played by the flexibility of the polyelectrolytes in the phase separation processes that lead to a complex coacervate ? unlike flexible polyelectrolyte mixtures@xcite , local enhancements in concentration of rodlike systems can produce orientationally ordered liquid crystalline phases ( such as nematic , smectic and cholesteric phases).@xcite thus , a coacervate produced by complexing oppositely charged rodlike polymers may be a liquid crystal rather than an isotropic fluid . in this paper , where we consider `` symmetric '' achiral rodlike polymers with fore - aft symmetry , equal length , and equal but opposite charge ,",
    "we have explored the competition between isotropic and nematic ordering in rodlike polyelectrolyte mixtures and elucidated how the phase boundaries depend on different parameters of the system .    before presenting our theory and numerical results on the _ binary mixtures _",
    ", it is worthwhile to briefly review the theoretical literature aimed at understanding the phase separation of _ single component _ flexible@xcite and rodlike@xcite polyelectrolyte solutions .",
    "these studies have been primarily focused on poor solvent conditions . in the case of solutions containing a flexible polyelectrolyte",
    ", it has been shown that the dependence of the phase boundaries on the polyelectrolyte chain length is weak ( referred to as the `` weak polymer effect''@xcite ) .",
    "note that the condition of donnan equilibrium was invoked in these calculations so that locally the system is electroneutral .",
    "this implies that a local increase in the charge on the polyelectrolyte leads to an increase in the local concentration of counterions .",
    "the localisation of the counterions is entropically unfavorable and hence , the region of two - phase coexistence shrinks with an increase in the charge on the polyelectrolyte chains@xcite .",
    "phase - separating mixtures of _ two oppositely charged polyelectrolytes _ are fundamentally different from these solutions containing a single kind of polyelectrolyte in two ways .",
    "firstly , oppositely charged polyelectrolyte mixtures can phase separate even under good solvent conditions for the two individual polymer components .",
    "secondly , it is clear in the binary mixture case that counterions are free to partition very differently upon phase separation .",
    "in particular , donnan equilibrium can be satisfied by bringing the oppositely charged macromolecules together in the concentrated coacervate phase,@xcite while freeing the small ions to gain entropy by populating both dilute and concentrated phase in charge compensating proportions . clearly , it is necessary to account for these extra degrees of freedom available to the counterions in studying phase separation in mixtures of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes . in the case of _ single component _",
    "rodlike polyelectrolyte solutions , it has been shown recently@xcite that electrostatic interactions among like - charged rods favors orientational ordering at concentrations lower than the overlap concentration .",
    "this non - trivial result is an outcome of long - range , multi - rod correlations present in these systems .",
    "a consequence is that , in addition to the lyotropic isotropic - nematic transition observed in neutral rodlike solutions , _ thermotropic _ isotropic - nematic as well as nematic - nematic phase transitions have been predicted for charged rodlike polyelectrolytes .",
    "note that these predictions are a consequence of collective phenomena at higher concentrations that are not manifest in earlier theories of dilute rodlike polyelectrolytes , where the twisting effect@xcite of pairwise electrostatic interactions between rods was shown to destroy nematic ordering@xcite .    with this background on the phase separation in polyelectrolyte solutions",
    ", we present our theoretical model for the binary mixtures .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the theory is presented in section [ sec : theory ] , the results are presented in section [ sec : results ] , and section [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "we consider a _ symmetric _ binary mixture of rodlike polyelectrolytes bearing opposite charges on their backbone in the presence of the counterions originating from the polyelectrolyte chains . by _ symmetric _",
    "mixtures , we mean mixtures containing equal number of polyelectrolyte chains , which are identical to each other in every aspect other than the sign of the charge they are bearing . for generality in the following ,",
    "we maintain notation representing different polymeric species such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 representing the number of polycationic and polyanionic chains , resepectively . for the theoretical treatment ,",
    "we consider a binary mixture of rods with the same diameters ( @xmath2 ) for each species but lengths @xmath3 for @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath5 is taken to be the linear charge density for polyelectrolytes of type @xmath4 so that there are @xmath6 counterions released by each polyelectrolyte of type @xmath7 . as the charge on the polymers",
    "is spread uniformly along their length , this description is often referred to as the `` smeared charge '' model .",
    "we specialize to the symmetric case only as needed after plugging @xmath8 and @xmath9 at the appropriate place .",
    "also , we work in the canonical ensemble with the volume of the system denoted by @xmath10 .    the solvent is treated implicitly and as a uniform dielectric background for the purpose of computing electrostatic interactions .",
    "the small ions are taken to be point like and we ignore short range structure , correlations , and polarization effects in the solvent .      before presenting quantitative details of our theory for the symmetric rodlike polyelectrolyte mixtures ,",
    "a qualitative picture can be drawn by using three important results available from the literature .",
    "first , the macrophase separation in the isotropic phase ( by analogy with symmetric mixtures of flexible polylectrolytes ) takes place at very low monomer densities@xcite , when the electrostatic attractions between oppositely charged polyelectrolytes are strong enough to drive the phase separation .",
    "second , the isotropic - nematic phase transition observed in neutral rodlike molecules and treated by onsager and many others@xcite takes place at relatively high monomer densities above the overlap concentration and is driven primarily by entropic effects associated with the excluded volume of rodlike objects .",
    "thirdly , we recall that addition of charges to rodlike polymers can induce thermotropic ( temperature dependent ) isotropic - nematic phase transitions , as opposed to the lyotropic ( concentration dependent ) transitions familiar in neutral rodlike polymer systems .",
    "the origin of this thermotropic behavior lies in the long - ranged electrostatic interactions , which depend on the charge on the polyelectrolytes and the temperature dependent bjerrum s length @xmath11 , which is the distance at which the coulomb interaction energy between two elementary charges is of the order of thermal energy ( @xmath12 being the boltzmann s constant and @xmath13 is the temperature ) . here ,",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are the permittivities of vacuum and the medium , respectively .    by integrating these three competing effects , a _ qualitative _ phase diagram of a symmetric rodlike polyelectrolyte mixture",
    "is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_cartoon ] in the coordinates of @xmath16 versus @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a reference monomer length , @xmath19 is the overall rod length , @xmath20 is the rod diameter , @xmath21 is the total number of cationic and anionic rods , and @xmath10 is the system volume .",
    "broadly , we see two trends in the figure . at high temperatures , i.e. low values of @xmath22 ,",
    "non - interacting isotropic - isotropic and isotropic - nematic coexistence regions appear at low and high rod concentrations , respectively .",
    "as the temperature is lowered ( @xmath22 raised ) , these features collide and ultimately at low temperature there is a broad region of two phase coexistence between a dilute isotropic supernatant phase and a semidilute or concentrated nematic `` coacervate '' phase . at intermediate values of @xmath22 , more complex phase behavior",
    "is evident , including the possibility of three - phase coexistence between two isotropic phases and a nematic phase .    with regard to the isotropic - isotropic coexistence region in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_cartoon ] , which is also present in flexible polyelectrolyte mixtures , a scaling analysis is helpful to understand the variables that control its extent and shape and differentiate the cases of rigid and flexible systems . for this purpose , we begin by considering a symmetric mixture containing an equal number @xmath23 of oppositely charged _ flexible _ polyelectrolytes in the absence of any counterions .",
    "physically , such a situation is realized in a solution containing polyacids and polybases . apart from electrostatic interactions , excluded volume effects",
    "can be simply accounted for ( in an implicit solvent model ) by an excluded volume parameter @xmath24 .",
    "this particular system was recently studied using the field - theoretic simulation technique@xcite .",
    "the osmotic pressure of such a system in the dilute regime@xcite , i.e. @xmath25 , with @xmath26 being the monomer density and the overlap concentration , respectively , is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the debye screening length in the asymptotic dilute regime where the polyelectrolytes behave as multivalent macroions .",
    "we note that although the polymers are assumed to be flexible , the expression that we use for @xmath29 assumes that they adopt extended rodlike conformations at infinite dilution . in the above expression",
    ", @xmath30 is the charge per monomer ( in units of the fundamental charge @xmath31 ) , which is the same for each kind of polyelectrolyte in the assumed symmetric mixture and @xmath32 is the total number of monomers .    in eq .",
    "[ eq : pressure_flex_dil ] , the first and second terms correspond to the translational entropy of the polyelectrolyte chains and the effect of excluded volume interactions on the pressure , respectively .",
    "the third term containing @xmath33 , a debye - hckel contribution , originates from attractive electrostatic correlations among dilute , non - overlapping polyelectrolyte chains .",
    "in contrast , at higher polymer concentrations where chains overlap the internal structure of the polyelectrolytes plays a significant role . the dominant electrostatic contribution to the osmotic pressure in the high density , overlapping regime ( @xmath34 )",
    "can be represented by the scaling expression @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a dimensionless scaling function that we assume to be a power law @xmath37 for large argument .",
    "the exponent @xmath38 is determined by the requirement that in the concentrated regime , the local properties are not different for a solution having multiple chains containing @xmath32 monomers each or a single chain that fills space with the same overall segment density @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) . in other words ,",
    "the electrostatic contribution to the osmotic pressure must be independent of @xmath32 at fixed @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath41 .",
    "this requirement , along with the fact that the overlap concentration scales as @xmath42 , leads to the well - known result@xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 . in the concentrated regime ,",
    "the osmotic pressure of flexible , symmetric polyelectrolyte mixtures is thus dictated by a balance between excluded volume and this modified electrostatic correlation energy , i.e. @xmath45    we can now retrace these scaling arguments for the case of symmetric mixtures of _ rodlike _ polylectrolytes .",
    "the osmotic pressure in the dilute concentration regime ( @xmath46 ) is unchanged except that we replace the excluded volume coefficient @xmath24 with the onsager expression @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a monomer segment length , @xmath49 in the concentrated regime , the electrostatic free energy of a system of rods can be approximated by the sum of the self - energies of individual rods experiencing the electrostatic potential induced by the other rods . for the purpose of estimation ,",
    "these are placed on a periodic lattice .",
    "it is well - known that the self - energy of a charged cylindrical rod of length @xmath19 and linear charge density @xmath30 is divergent@xcite , and is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a cut - off introduced to regularize the self - energy and @xmath52 is the radius of a unit cell ( wigner - seitz ) applied to each cylinder . using the fact that @xmath53 in the concentrated regime and writing the electrostatic free energy of the solution containing @xmath23 rods as @xmath54 , the electrostatic contribution to the pressure is given by @xmath55    comparing eqs .",
    "[ eq : pressure_flex ] and  [ eq : pressure_rods_qual2 ] , it is clear that the qualitative difference between flexible and rodlike polyelectrolyte mixtures is in the functional form for the attractive electrostatic contribution to the osmotic pressure . in the case of rodlike polyelectrolytes ,",
    "this term scales like @xmath56 in contrast to @xmath57 for flexible coils .",
    "thus , at the same set of electrostatic parameters and monomer densities , and for weakly charged polyelectrolytes where @xmath58 , electrostatic correlation effects are weaker for rodlike polyelectrolytes in comparison with flexible polyelectrolyte mixtures .",
    "since the electrostatic contribution to the pressure is responsible for polyelectrolyte complexation , it follows that rodlike polyelectrolyte mixtures are less prone to complex coacervation than analogous flexible polyelectrolyte mixtures .",

    "the completely ordered nematic phase becomes one of the coexisting phases .",

    "the value of @xmath234 at which the three phase coexistence takes place depends sensitively on the linear charge density of the polyelectrolytes .",
    "we have also investigated the effect of counterions on the phase coexistence boundaries ( isotropic - isotropic and isotropic - nematic ) .",
    "comparison of the results for the systems with and without counterions reveals that sufficiently high concentrations of counterions suppress both isotropic - isotropic and isotropic - nematic coexistence .",
    "a key prediction of theory is the result that the concentration of counterions in the dense ( or coacervate ) phase is slightly higher than in the dilute ( or supernatant ) phase .",
    "also , comparison of the phase separation boundaries between comparable rodlike and flexible polyelectrolyte mixtures reveals that the isotropic - isotropic macrophase separation regime is broader in the case of weakly charged flexible polyelectrolytes .",
    "furthermore , in this work , we have limited ourselves to the phase separation regime in the mixtures containing weakly charged polyelectrolytes close to the critical point .",
    "we have found that the critical points for the isotropic - isotropic and isotropic - nematic phase transitions exist at very low number density of rods ( @xmath246 ) and weak electrostatic interaction strengths ( i.e. , @xmath247 ) . at this point , we remark on the range of validity of the theory to describe the phase boundaries and some of the future directions .",
    "there are three key issues , which limits the validity of the theory . in future",
    ", we ll extend the theory to higher electrostatic interaction strengths by addressing the issues mentioned below .",
    "first issue is the use of the random phase approximation ( rpa ) to compute the contribution to the free energy coming from the electrostatic correlations . a typical way to judge",
    "the validity of the rpa is to compare the mean field contribution with the correlation term in the free energy . due to the fact that the mean field contribution to the free energy coming from the electrostatics is zero and correlation terms beyond the rpa",
    "are not available , the range of validity of rpa ca nt be inferred directly . however , general consensus@xcite is that the rpa for flexible polymers is valid for concentrations above the overlap concentration . in this work ,",
    "the coacervate phase has concentration above the overlap concentration and the supernatant phase is very dilute .",
    "indeed , the supernatant phase is not well described by the rpa . on the other hand ,",
    "the rpa is suitable for a very good quantitative description of the phase boundary describing the coacervate phase .",
    "remarkably , the rpa predicts a supernatant phase with almost zero density in qualitative agreement with the experiments@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the rpa describing the coacervate phase boundary in the case of flexible polyelectrolyte mixtures has been compared extensively with the experiments@xcite and simulations@xcite .",
    "indeed , agreement between the theory , simulations and experiments is remarkable . in order to go beyond the rpa",
    ", hartree approximation@xcite can be used , which can provide a more quantiative description for the supernatant phase also .",
    "however , we leave it for future work .    second issue arises due to the use of the onsager second virial approach to describe the steric effects in the case of long rods .",
    "it is well - known@xcite that the approach only works in the limit of very long aspect ratio of the rods .",
    "in fact , the limit of validity of the onsager corresponds to @xmath248 .",
    "furthermore , the second virial approach is strictly valid for low number density of the rods . for dense systems ,",
    "higher order terms needs to be considered . for very long rods ,",
    "the isotropic - nematic and isotropic - isotropic phase transitions occur at low enough number densities of the rods ( which is of the order of overlap concentration ) .",
    "this is the reason the second virial approach is able to correctly predict these phase transitions at low electrostatic interaction strengths .",
    "however , an increase in the electrostatic interaction strength causes the density of the coacervate phase to increase and the virial approach breaks down .",
    "this deficiency of the theory can be removed by considering the effect of higher order terms@xcite , which we ll consider in future .",
    "third issue is the ignorance of charge renormalization while describing phase separation . in this work ,",
    "the phase separation regime corresponding to very low electrostatic interaction strengths is described assuming that there is no counterion adsorption on the polyelectrolytes .",
    "in this regime , the issue of charge renormalization during phase separation can be safely ignored . however , with the increase in the electrostatic interaction strength , counterions can adsorb on the polyelectrolytes and modulate their charge . for this part of the phase diagram , the degree of ionization for each polyelectrolyte in each phase needs to be computed , while equating the chemical potential and pressure of each component in the two phases@xcite . in other words ,",
    "the possibility of different degree of ionizations in daughter phases needs to be explored . in this work , we have limited the theoretical study to @xmath184 , where issue of counterion adsorption can be safely ignored .",
    "a related issue is the consideration of ionic clusters ( such as dipoles , quadrapoles etc . )",
    "formed as a result of strong electrostatic attraction between different oppositely charged components .",
    "it has been shown@xcite in the literature that the issue of ion - pairing has to be taken into account in the case of hard sphere model for simple electrolytes ( also known as restricted primitive model ( rpm ) ) to correctly match the simulation results in the critical regime .",
    "this is a manifestation of the fact that the critical point for the rpm , as predicted by the debye - hckel theory , corresponds@xcite to @xmath249 , where @xmath93 is the charge per sphere , @xmath250 is the bjerrum length at the critical point and @xmath251 is the diameter of the hard spheres . for symmetrical electrolytes , @xmath251 is the same for both kinds of charged spheres .",
    "also , for monovalent electrolytes , @xmath252 and the critical point exists at very low temperature such that @xmath253 . at such low temperatures ,",
    "indeed one has to extend the debye - hckel theory ( which is a rpa like ) by including atleast dipolar interactions in the regime near the critical point .",
    "however , in contrast to the symmetric electrolytic mixtures , the phase separation regime close to the critical point in the case of mixtures containing long flexible or rodlike polyelectrolytes can be well described within rpa without any consideration of ion - ion , ion - polyelectrolyte ( which is the same as the counterion adsorption ) or polyelectrolyte - polyelectrolyte pairs .",
    "this is an outcome of the fact that now the phase separation takes place at relatively higher temperatures and low densities . in this regime ,",
    "the mixtures of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes behave as weakly correlated liquids@xcite .",
    "however , if we increase the electrostatic interaction strength and go far from the critical regime , there is a competition for pairing between different oppositely charged species .",
    "a rough estimate for the minimum driving force for pairing between the ions is given by bjerrum s theory@xcite of ion - pairs .",
    "according to the theory , life time of the paired state in the case of two oppositely charged ions ( while undergoing thermal motion ) significantly increases when @xmath254 , @xmath255 being the distance between the ions . in this regime ,",
    "the electrostatic attraction takes over the thermal energy of ions and ion - ion pair ( or dipole ) needs to be considered as a new species .",
    "this relation can be cast in terms of number density of ions ( @xmath256 ) by using @xmath257 so that @xmath258 .",
    "issue of ion pairs / clusters formed as a result of binding , which involves charged monomers is more suble compared to the issue of pairing in small ions .",
    "however , we can estimate the regime , where one has to explicitly consider the binding between the polyelectrolytes and oppositely charged counterions or polyelectrolytes . carrying out a single chain analysis ,",
    "it has been shown that the binding of counterions on flexible and rodlike polyelectrolytes becomes important@xcite roughly around @xmath259 .",
    "similarly , an analysis of the system containing two oppositely charged flexible polyelectrolytes@xcite reveals that the complexation takes place only for strong electrostatic interaction strengths ( i.e. , @xmath260 ) .",
    "for rodlike polyelectrolytes , the electrostatic interaction strength required for complexation needs to be stronger compared to the flexible polyelectrolytes due to weaker ( logarithmic ) electrostatic potential for rodlike polymers .",
    "these single chain analyses provide a clear picture about the dilute solution regime . in the regime above the overlap concentration for polymers ,",
    "situation is more complicated and one has to consider the multi - chain effects .",
    "however , one can carry out a mean - field analysis@xcite to estimate the fraction of charged monomers involved in binding ( say , @xmath261 )",
    ". it can be readily shown@xcite that the fraction is given by the relation @xmath262\\exp(|e / k_b t|)$ ] , @xmath263 being the energy gain _ per pair_. in this work , we have considered weakly charged polyelectrolyte solutions at very low electrostatic interaction strengths so that the fraction of charged monomers involved in pairing is close to zero .    at present",
