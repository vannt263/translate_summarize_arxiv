    "it is expected that a large class of one dimensional , asymmetric , stochastic , conservative interacting particle systems / growth models fall into the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) universality class .",
    "a manifestation of this is that the kpz equation should appear as the limit of such systems in the weakly asymmetric limit .",
    "the weakly asymmetric limit means to observe the process on space scales of order @xmath3 and time scales of order @xmath4 , while simultaneously rescaling the asymmetry of the model so that it is of order @xmath5 .",
    "this sort of weak asymmetry zooms in on the critical transition point between the two universality classes associated with growth models  the kpz class ( positive asymmetry ) and the edwards wilkinson ( ew ) class ( symmetry )  and thus further confirms a mantra of statistical physics that at critical points one expects universal scaling limits .",
    "bertini and giacomin @xcite obtained the first result for the weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process near equilibrium .",
    "this is extended to some situations farther from equilibrium in @xcite , directed random polymers in @xcite , and partial results are now available @xcite for speed changed asymmetric exclusion . in this article",
    "we study the situation where asymmetry is to the left and the initial data has an increasing step , so that in the hydrodynamic limit one sees a rarefaction fan .",
    "we observe the process along a line @xmath6 within the fan and study the fluctuations .",
    "these converge to the kpz equation with initial data depending on @xmath7 . for @xmath7",
    "strictly inside the fan , the initial data is an appropriate scaling of a delta function , and the distribution of the fluctuations is known exactly @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our main interest in this article is the fluctuations at the edge of the rarefaction fan .",
    "the scaling turns out to be a little different , but the fluctuations are still given by kpz . note",
    "that since the work of @xcite it is understood that kpz is only a formal equation for the fluctuation field and is rigorously defined as the logarithm of the stochastic heat equation .",
    "the edge fluctuations correspond to starting the stochastic heat equation with @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a standard brownian motion in @xmath10 , with @xmath11 .",
    "we will obtain an exact expression for the one point probability distribution of the resulting law  the _ edge crossover distribution _  at any positive time .",
    "the main tool is the tracy - widom determinental formula for one sided bernoulli data and therefore we are restricted to asymmetric exclusion .",
    "the resulting law is expected to be universal for fluctuations at the edge of the rarefaction fan for models in the kpz class .",
    "the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) with parameters @xmath12 ( such that @xmath13 ) is a continuous time markov process on the discrete lattice @xmath14 with state space @xmath15 ( the 1 s are thought of as particles and the 0 s as holes ) . the dynamics for this process are given as follows : each particle has an independent exponential alarmclock which rings at rate one .",
    "when the alarm goes off the particle flips a coin and with probability @xmath16 attempts to jump one site to the right and with probability @xmath17 attempts to jump one site to the left .",
    "if there is a particle at the destination , the jump is suppressed and the alarm is reset ( see @xcite for a rigorous construction of this process ) . if @xmath18 this process is the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) ; if @xmath19 it is the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) ; if @xmath20 it is the symmetric simple exclusion process ( ssep ) . finally , if we introduce a parameter into the model , we can let @xmath21 go to zero with that parameter , and then this class of processes are known as the weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process ( wasep ) .",

    "the main technical modification is due to a new infinite product , which we call @xmath72 . relating this to @xmath73gamma functions we are able to extract the new asymptotic kernel which now also contains gamma functions .",
    "as we will see in section [ kpz_sec ] , the @xmath67 distribution is also the one - point distribution for the kpz equation ( [ kpz0 ] ) with specific initial data ( [ half_brownian ] ) .",
    "it is clear from this result that time and space scale differently .",
    "specifically , the ratio of the scaling exponents for time : space : fluctuations is @xmath74 .",
    "this scaling ratio was shown in @xcite to hold for a wide class of @xmath75 dimensional growth models .",
    "finally , the @xmath76 shift with respect to the @xmath77 variable reflects the parabolic curvature of the rarefaction fan nearby the edge .",
    "the above result should be compared ( see section [ height_func_two_sided_sec ] ) with the existing fluctuation theory for tasep and asep . in those cases , using the same centering and scaling as in ( [ height_fluc_eqn ] ) , @xcite and @xcite ( respectively for tasep and asep ) obtained formulas for the one - point probability distribution function .",
    "these formulas actually first arose in the study of the largest eigenvalue of rank one perturbations of complex wishart random matrix ensembles @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the limiting distributions are the same regardless of the asymmetry @xmath47 , as long as it is held positive as the other variables scale to infinity . by scaling @xmath47 as above we focus in on the crossover between the asep and the ssep and the new family of edge crossover distribution functions represent this transition .    for tasep , @xcite gave a formula for the asymptotic equal time height function fluctuation process ( in terms of finite dimensional distributions ) .",

    "since in wasep we scale the asymmetry with time and space in a critical way , the fluctuation distributions are not the same as for tasep or asep .",
    "rather than having @xmath44 one could perform asymptotics with @xmath85 .",
    "doing this is becomes apparent that increasing @xmath61 is like increasing @xmath86 , hence , one expects to recover the tasep distributions from the wasep edge crossover distributions as @xmath87 .",
    "[ conj ] let @xmath63 , as well as @xmath88 and @xmath60 be as in definition [ defoffluc ] .",

    "this is best stated in terms of the stochastic heat equation so we delay it to proposition [ small_t_prop ] .      following the approach of @xcite , we prove that as @xmath48 goes to zero , a slight variant on the fluctuation field @xmath60 converges to the kpz equation with appropriate initial data .",
    "the kpz equation was introduced by kardar - parisi - zhang in 1986 as arguably the simplest stochastic pde which contained terms to account for the desired behavior of one - dimensional interface growth @xcite : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is space - time white noise ( see @xcite section 1.4 for a rigorous definition of white noise ) @xmath94 = \\delta(t - s)\\delta(y - x).\\ ] ] despite its simplicity , the kpz equation has resisted analysis for quite some time .",
    "the reason is that , even for nice initial data , the solution at a later time @xmath57 will look locally like a brownian motion in @xmath10 . hence the nonlinear term is ill - defined .    in order to make sense of this kpz equation we follow @xcite and",

    "this idea was first implemented for equilibrium initial conditions in @xcite and is facilitated by the fact that the hopf - cole transform of the fluctuations ( with lower order changes to the scalings ) actually satisfies a discrete space , continuous time stochastic heat equation itself @xcite .",
