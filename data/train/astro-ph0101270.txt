    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have been studied for several decades , but our understanding of many aspects of agn is still rudimentary . the observed emission from agn is thought to be powered by the release of gravitational potential energy from matter falling into supermassive black holes , but the details of this process and their effect on the observed spectra of agn are not understood .",
    "our inability to definitively understand agn to date may be due in part to selection effects .",
    "most high - luminosity agn ( quasars ) have been selected using their rest - frame ultraviolet through optical colors in optically magnitude - limited samples .",
    "it is therefore almost certain that dust obscuration has masked some portion of the agn population from detection , and that agn found by their ultraviolet - optical colors are less dusty than the truly typical agn @xcite .",
    "this bias against dust - obscured objects can affect our understanding of agn , in particular their connection to their host galaxies and nuclear environments .",
    "( we use the term dust _ obscuration _ to refer to the combined effects of dust _ extinction _ , the reduction in observed flux from an object screened by dust , and dust _ reddening _ , which arises from typical ` non - gray ' extinction that is stronger at bluer wavelengths .",
    "extinction can occur without reddening , but reddening can not occur without extinction . )    the two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has now made it feasible to select samples of agn in the near infrared ( nir ) .",
    "a sample selected only by nir magnitude is an excellent way to reduce any bias against dust - obscured objects , but for efficient selection of agn candidates it is usually necessary to use additional selection criteria such as morphology and color . to aid in this endeavor and to provide a list of agn with homogeneous infrared data , in this paper we present the results of a cross - correlation of the 2mass second incremental data release with the quasar catalog of (",
    "* hereafter vv00 ) .",
    "we took all 13214 quasars ( defined as agn more luminous than @xmath3 , regardless of radio power ) from table 1 of vv00 and searched for unresolved 2mass counterparts within @xmath4 .",
    "we found 2327 counterparts for 2320 quasars and discarded the more distant ones for the seven quasars with two counterparts .",
    "there were 4000 additional quasars which fell within the 2mass areal coverage but were not detected by it .",
    "the internal errors on the 2mass astrometry are on average 03 for our detections , so the uncertainty in the astrometric matching is dominated by the errors on the quasar coordinates . only 53 of the vv00 quasars have positions which may be uncertain by several arcminutes ( denoted ` a ' by vv00 ) . the majority ( 8884 ) have optical positions which are accurate to @xmath5 ( ` o ' ) , and 523 have similarly accurate radio positions ( ` r ' ) .",
    "the remaining 3754 have positions which should be good to a few arcsec ( these have no code in vv00 , but we denote them here by ` n ' ) .",
    "a search for counterparts to fake objects indicates that even our near - ir counterparts of code ` n ' objects are likely to be real .",
    "we shifted the declinations of all 13214 vv00 quasars",
    "6@xmath6 to the north and searched for matches within @xmath4 to determine the number of spurious counterparts in our sample .",
    "only 74 fake - object counterparts were found , as opposed to 2320 real - object counterparts .",
    "this indicates that there are few spurious counterparts in our sample , but the contamination can be reduced even further by requiring a match within @xmath0 instead of @xmath4 .",
    "only 43 of 2320 counterparts ( including the one code ` a ' object among the 2320 ) have a separation between the vv00 and 2mass positions of @xmath7 , while 37 of 74 fake - object matches have separations @xmath7 .",
    "thus the number of counterparts to vv00 quasars with separations between @xmath0 and @xmath4 is consistent with the number expected from random chance , and for our final sample we only consider counterparts with separations @xmath8 .",
    "our final catalog consists of 2mass counterparts to 2277 vv00 quasars , of which about 37 ( 1.6% ) are expected to be chance coincidences .",
    "the 2mass and vv00 identifications of these 2277 quasars are given in table  [ tab_detected ] .",
    "the 4000 vv00 quasars not detected by 2mass despite lying within the area of the second incremental data release are listed in table  [ tab_missing ] .",
    "radio luminosities were computed for all vv00 quasars that had measured 6 cm radio flux densities .",
    "we assumed a radio spectral index of @xmath9 , a hubble constant of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we classified each quasar as radio - loud ( rlq ) or radio - quiet ( rqq ) based on the ratio of its radio to optical luminosity ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the divide between rlq and rqq was taken as log(@xmath12)=0 .",
    "optical luminosities were calculated from @xmath13 as given in vv00 . near infrared luminosities",
    "were calculated from @xmath14 magnitudes given in the 2mass catalog using @xmath15-corrections for a power - law continuum with @xmath16 , the same value used by vv00 to calculate their @xmath17 values .",
    "figure [ logirz ] shows the degeneracy between luminosity and redshift inherent in any single flux - limited survey .",
    "however , it is clear that 2mass can in principle detect quasars to at least @xmath18 .",
    "figure [ logrirz ] shows that most vv00 quasars with radio information are radio - loud quasars , since vv00 do not report upper limits on radio flux densities . assuming that vv00 reported radio data for all radio - selected quasars , the majority of radio - selected quasars catalogued in vv00 are radio - loud , and most radio - quiet quasars in vv00",
    "must not have been radio - selected .",
    "the rlq vs. rqq bimodality seen in heterogeneous quasar samples is not erased by plotting @xmath19 instead of @xmath12 . however , it is interesting to note that some objects which qualify as radio - loud using @xmath12 would be classified as radio - quiet using @xmath19 ( or vice - versa , depending on where the division between rlq and rqq is made in @xmath19 ) .",
    "one possible explanation for this might be because some radio - selected quasars in vv00 are obscured by dust and have low values of @xmath20 for their @xmath21 .",
    "figure [ logiroz ] shows that radio - loud quasars from vv00 are more likely to have large @xmath22 ratios ( @xmath23 ) than radio - quiet quasars from vv00 .",
    "9.9% of known rlqs from vv00 which are detected in 2mass have @xmath24 compared to only 2.5% of rqqs and quasars with unknown radio properties .",
    "again , this is understandable if some radio - selected quasars in vv00 are obscured by dust and consequently have their values of @xmath20 suppressed relative to their @xmath21 .",
    "radio - quiet quasars similarly obscured by dust would be underrepresented in magnitude - limited optically selected samples , especially color - selected ones , and thus less likely to be catalogued in vv00 .",
    "note that the many upper limits at large @xmath22 belong to optically faint quasars whose @xmath21 values are poorly constrained by the relatively shallow 2mass data .",
    "also note the shifts toward slightly larger @xmath22 at @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the former is probably due to host galaxy contributions to @xmath21 , and the latter to the presence of h@xmath27 in the @xmath28 band , neither of which are compensated for by our simple power - law @xmath15-correction .    to determine if the @xmath22 distribution of the rlqs differed significantly from that of the other quasars , i.e. the rqqs and quasars with unknown radio properties ( ruqs ) , we used the peto - prentice generalized wilcoxon test for censored datasets @xcite , as implemented in the stsdas.statistics package of iraf",
    "this test is insensitive to differences in the censoring patterns for the two samples being compared .",
    "the combination of rqqs and ruqs forms a valid , conservative sample for comparison with the rlqs , since rqqs comprise @xmath2990% of quasars and since any unrecognized rlqs among the ruqs will dilute any intrinsic difference between the @xmath22 distributions of rlqs and rqqs .",
    "we find that the @xmath22 ratios distributions of these two samples are different at the 99.99% confidence level .",
    "again , we do not believe that the higher fraction of large @xmath22 ratio objects among _ known _ rlqs compared to _ known _ rqqs is an intrinsic property of rlqs , but is merely a reflection of the lesser bias against dust - obscured quasars with large @xmath22 ratios in radio - selected samples compared to optically - selected samples .",
    "figure [ logirob ] corroborates the suggestion that quasars with large @xmath22 ratios are obscured by dust .",
    "it shows that such quasars are much less common among the population of quasars more luminous than @xmath30 than among the less luminous population .",
    "the peto - prentice test shows that this difference is significant at @xmath3199.995% confidence whether the sample of all vv00 quasars is split at @xmath32 or is split in half ( at @xmath33 ) .",
    "this is to be expected if dust obscuration is lowering @xmath20 ( and @xmath17 ) relative to @xmath21 , thus increasing @xmath22 . by itself",
    "this does not rule out alternative explanations .",
    "however , host galaxy contributions to the nir luminosities would require extremely luminous host galaxies since the quasars with large @xmath22 ratios have @xmath34 ( figure  [ logiroz ] ) .",
    "also , a scenario where large @xmath22 ratios are caused by synchrotron emission extending into the nir in some radio - loud quasars @xcite does not explain why such emission should preferentially occur in less luminous quasars .",
    "dust obscuration seems the simplest explanation for figure [ logirob ] , although we note that francis , whiting & webster ( 2000 ) concluded that synchrotron emission was the best explanation for the red colors of the many rlqs in the parkes half - jansky sample of @xcite .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , if there indeed exists a population of dust - obscured radio - loud quasars , then it is desirable to search for a population of dust - obscured radio - quiet quasars without being strongly biased against such objects .",
    "selection on nir magnitudes reduces bias due to dust extinction , and selection on nir colors reduces bias due to dust reddening .",
    "we use the sample of vv00 quasars detected by 2mass to investigate nir selection .",
    "however , it must be kept in mind that the majority of quasars from vv00 are probably not strongly dust - obscured due to their predominantly optical selection .",
    "the range of quasar colors in our large sample may reflect the true range of quasar colors , but the distribution of colors will not reflect the true distribution .",
    "@xcite have begun identifying candidate obscured agn in 2mass using a simple criterion of @xmath35 , as reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this criterion was chosen based on the colors of a sample of miscellaneous agn including the palomar - green ( pg ) agn @xcite , from which @xcite conclude that ",
    "virtually all of these known qsos have @xmath36 .... \" however , as seen in figure [ zjk.epsl ] , a @xmath35 criterion selects 13% of quasars from vv00 at @xmath37 , as well as a smaller percentage at @xmath34 . thus ,",
    "unless the known quasars with @xmath35 in vv00 are preferentially dust - obscured quasars , a @xmath35 selection criterion will suffer some contamination from unobscured quasars . on the other hand , all but four of the 2277 vv00 quasars detected by 2mass have @xmath38 , whereas the 2mass agn of @xcite have values as red as @xmath39 .",
    "therefore a selection criterion of @xmath40 should select dust - obscured agn with little contamination .    however , a @xmath40 selection criterion would not be complete ; that is , it would not sample the full population of obscured agn . we know this for two reasons",
    "first , @xcite do not find evidence of dust reddening only in agn with @xmath40 .",
    "second , we show in the next section that @xmath41 color is not well correlated with @xmath42 color , whose longer wavelength baseline than any optical - nir color besides @xmath43 makes it arguably the most efficient photometric measure of the reddening of a quasar in the optical - nir @xcite , given the difficult in obtaining deep wide - field @xmath44-band data . a long wavelength baseline is needed to distinguish reddening from the intrinsic dispersion in quasar colors .",
    "the observed dispersion in the 2mass quasar sample is only 031 in @xmath41 , vs. 067 in @xmath42 ( calculated using @xmath45 clipping to remove outliers , and using only @xmath46 quasars for @xmath41 ) .",
    "however , the sensitivity to reddening is given by the ratio of the color excess to this dispersion : @xmath47/@xmath48=2.12 vs. @xmath49/@xmath50=3.84 at @xmath51 ( the difference is even more extreme at @xmath52 ) .",
    "simply put , less extinction is required to produce anomalously red colors in @xmath42 than in @xmath41 , or indeed than in any other optical - nir color besides @xmath43 .",
    "finally , the variation of @xmath41 color with redshift seen in figure [ zjk.epsl ] means that a simple @xmath41 color cut will not select reddened agn with equal efficiency at all redshifts .",
    "thus the evidence available to date , while scarce , suggests that infrared colors alone are insufficient to _ efficiently _ sample the full parameter space open to obscured quasars .",
    "the 2mass catalog includes @xmath53 and @xmath54 magnitudes from the usno - a and tycho catalogs , as well as @xmath55 . as noted by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "sampling the full parameter space open to obscured quasars will be difficult based on @xmath56 vs. @xmath41 colors .",
    "however , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter whf ) have proposed a promising criterion for selecting @xmath14-band flux - limited samples of quasars from the @xmath57 vs. @xmath41 color - color diagram , which they dub the kx method .",
    "we do not have v magnitudes for the majority of our quasars , but the @xmath58 vs. @xmath41 diagram ( figure [ jkbjplusparkes.epsl ] ) shows the same gross features as the @xmath57 vs. @xmath41 diagram of whf ( their figure 2 ) . note that we plot our diagram upside - down relative to theirs , however .",
    "the dotted points in figure [ jkbjplusparkes.epsl ] are an essentially random sample of 14,000 high galactic latitude objects .",
    "the filled squares are the 2277 vv00 quasars with 2mass counterparts within 4 : known radio - quiet quasars among them are denoted by overplotted boxes , and known radio - loud quasars by overplotted crosses .",
    "the bulk of known quasars have blue @xmath58 colors , but there is a tail of candidate obscured quasars , predominantly rlqs , with @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "note that most of these quasars do not have @xmath61 .",
    "the dashed lines of constant @xmath42 color show that red @xmath41 color does not correlate strongly with red @xmath42 color either .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that @xmath41 does correlate with @xmath58 or @xmath42 but that this correlation is masked by strong selection effects against quasars with red @xmath58 and @xmath41 in figure [ jkbjplusparkes.epsl ] .",
    "however , we have also plotted a subsample of radio - selected quasars from the completely identified parkes half - jansky sample ( triangles ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is no strong correlation between @xmath41 and @xmath58 or @xmath42 for these objects either .",
    "selecting objects red in @xmath41 would not appear to be an efficient way of selecting objects red in @xmath42 .",
    "with rlqs , there is no guarantee that such red @xmath42 colors are due to dust rather than synchrotron emission with a short wavelength cutoff in the rest - frame optical @xcite .",
    "however , with rqqs the latter effect will be much weaker and any confirmed population of rqqs with @xmath62 will almost certainly be reddened by dust .",
    "the @xmath63 vs. @xmath41 color - color diagram ( figure [ jkrjplusparkes.epsl ] ) is similar to the @xmath57 and @xmath58 vs. @xmath41 diagrams , and as pointed out by whf offers the advantage of extending the effectiveness of the kx method from @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",
    "beyond @xmath65 , ly@xmath27 forest absorption greatly depresses the flux in the @xmath54 band , and the resulting red @xmath63 colors may result in confusion with stars .",
    "we have constructed selection criteria similar to the @xmath2 criterion of whf to illustrate the separation of quasars from stars in both @xmath1 and @xmath66 color - color diagrams ( solid lines in figure [ jkbjplusparkes.epsl ] and figure [ jkrjplusparkes.epsl ] ) .",
    "we adopt the following selection criteria in @xmath1 : @xmath67 and the following in @xmath66 : @xmath68 as pointed out by whf and as shown by the arrows in figure [ jkbjplusparkes.epsl ] and figure [ jkrjplusparkes.epsl ] , reddening moves quasars approximately parallel to these selection criteria and the bluer portion of the stellar locus in these diagrams , resulting in good sensitivity to reddened and unreddened quasars . only 124 of 2277 quasar counterparts ( 5.4% ) have colors that do not meet the @xmath1 selection criteria , while 283 ( 12.4% ) have colors that do not meet the @xmath66 selection criteria",
    ". some of these are probably chance coincidences of stars with vv00 quasars . assuming all 37 estimated spurious matches are among them , then only 87 quasar counterparts ( 3.8% ) do not meet the @xmath1 selection criteria while 236 quasar counterparts ( 10.4% ) do not meet the @xmath66 selection criteria .",
    "( since these criteria are illustrative only , we do not consider how efficient they are at rejecting stars , but any application of them to 2mass or other data must consider how close to the stellar locus the selection criteria can be drawn as a function of magnitude without selecting too many spurious candidates . )    for both selection criteria , the selection efficiency is dependent on redshift .",
    "figure [ zkx.epsl]a shows our @xmath1 selection parameter versus @xmath69 for all vv00 quasar counterparts , while figure [ zkx.epsl]b shows our @xmath66 selection parameter .",
    "the selection parameter is essentially the distance in the color - color diagram to the selection criterion line which divides quasar candidates from stars .",
    "objects with a positive selection parameter are accepted as candidates from that diagram . while @xmath66 selection may be more useful at @xmath70 than @xmath1 selection due to ly@xmath27 forest absorption in @xmath53 , it is less efficient at separating quasars from stars at @xmath71 . however , our @xmath1 criterion is not perfect : the intrinsic dispersion in quasar colors plus the redshift dependence of quasar colors may result in reduced selection efficiency at @xmath46 compared to @xmath25 and @xmath72 .",
    "thus , the @xmath2 criterion of whf , or a @xmath1 selection criterion patterned after theirs , appear to be a more complete method of selecting reddened agn than the simple @xmath61 selection of @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite find that the 2mass agn of @xcite span a much larger range in @xmath42 color and in optical polarization than the palomar - green ( pg ) agn even when the comparison is restricted to pg agn with @xmath61 . both of these trends are consistent with a much higher frequency of dust - obscured agn in the 2mass @xmath61 selected sample .",
    "this high frequency of dust - obscured agn found using a simple and probably incomplete criterion is unexpected given the lack of a correlation between @xmath41 and @xmath58 ( or @xmath42 ) , but it does suggest that more complete @xmath1 selected agn samples will be very efficient at finding great numbers of dust - obscured agn .",
    "of course , a key test will be to see where the 2mass agn of @xcite fall in the @xmath1 diagram .",
    "we have identified near infrared counterparts within @xmath0 of 2277 quasars from the veron - cetty & veron ( 2000 ) catalog using the 2mass second incremental data release .",
    "approximately 6320 quasars from veron - cetty & veron ( 2000 ) were located within the area covered by the 2mass catalog .",
    "this detection rate of 36% suggests that the final 2mass catalog will yield matches for approximately 4760 of the 13214 vv00 quasars .",
    "our sample of 2277 quasars with ir data is nearly ten times larger than the largest previous such sample @xcite , and more than ten times larger than the largest previous samples with homogeneous ir data @xcite .",
    "the observation that the fraction of radio - loud quasars with large @xmath22 ratios is higher than the fraction of probable radio - quiet quasars with such ratios supports the suggestion that _ known _ radio - selected quasars are more likely to be obscured by dust than _ known _ optically - selected quasars due to stronger selection effects against dust - obscured quasars in optically selected samples . known quasars with large @xmath22 ratios",
    "are also underrepresented among optically luminous quasars ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "this is again consistent with a selection effect caused by dust obscuration , which would tend to lower @xmath20 and @xmath13 while increasing @xmath22 .",
    "these results need to be confirmed using homogeneous quasar samples rather than the heterogeneous vv00 sample , but the statistical significance of our results in such a heterogeneous sample bodes well for their reality in more carefully selected samples .",
    "following warren , hewett & foltz ( 2000 ) , we show that the @xmath1 color - color diagram is more sensitive to the detection of dust - obscured quasars than using infrared colors alone .",
    "the stage is now set for the determination of the true fraction of dust - obscured rqqs using large nir surveys such as 2mass and denis .",
    "the detection of dust - obscured agn will also benefit greatly from hard x - ray surveys , but for the foreseeable future nir selection will be possible over much larger areas than hard x - ray selection , and thus more sensitive to luminous agn which are more easily studied in detail .",
    "we thank eljko ivezi ' c and the referee paul francis for useful comments , and roc cutri for determining which quasars were observed but not detected by 2mass .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",

    "<S> only 1.6% of these are expected to be chance coincidences . though this sample is heterogeneous , we find that known radio - loud quasars are more likely to have large near - infrared - to - optical luminosity ratios than radio - quiet quasars are , at a statistically significant level . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with dust - reddened quasars being more common in radio - selected samples than in optically - selected samples , due to stronger selection effects against dust - reddened quasars in the latter . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a statistically significant dearth of optically luminous quasars with large near - infrared - to - optical luminosity ratios . </S>",
    "<S> this can be explained in a dust obscuration model but not in a model where synchrotron emission extends from the radio into the near - infrared and creates such large ratios . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that selection of quasar candidates from the @xmath1 color - color diagram , modelled on the @xmath2 selection method of warren , hewett & foltz ( 2000 ) , is likely to be more sensitive to dust - obscured quasars than selection using only infrared - infrared colors . </S>"
