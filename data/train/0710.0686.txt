    "among the currently known planet - hosting stars , approximately 20% are members of binary systems @xcite .",
    "although to observers , the existence of such _ binary - planetary _ systems is not unexpected , to theorists , such _",
    "extreme _ planetary environments pose major challenges to theories of planet formation . while observations of systems such as l1551 @xcite indicate that planet - forming circumstellar disks , with masses similar to the mass of the primordial nebula of our solar system , exist around the components of binaries ( implying that planet - formation in dual - star systems can begin and proceed in the same fashion as around our sun ) , simulations of the formation of giant planets around stars of a binary yield mixed results .",
    "for instance , as shown by @xcite , giant planets can not form in binary systems with separations of @xmath1 au through disk instability or core accretion mechanisms . however , as shown by @xcite and by @xcite , disk instability can indeed form giant planets in binary systems , and as indicated by @xcite , the core - accretion mechanism is also capable of forming planets in dual - star systems [ see @xcite for a comprehensive review ] .",
    "the fact that giant planets exist in binary systems implies that planet formation in dual - star environments is robust .",
    "one important concern with such systems is , then , whether they can also form and harbor habitable planets . in this paper",
    ", we study habitable planet formation in binary systems that are moderately close ( i.e. , separation smaller then 50 au ) , and also harbor giant planets . among the currently known binary - planetary systems only three are of this kind : gl 86 @xcite , @xmath0 cephei @xcite , and hd 41004 @xcite .",
    "we are in particular interested to understand how the dynamics of the secondary star affects the late stage of the formation of terrestrial - class planets in the habitable zone of the primary and the delivery of water to its habitable planets .",
    "to study the late stage of habitable planet formation , the collisional growth of a few hundred moon- to mars - sized objects ( planetary embryos ) has to be simulated . in a recent article @xcite",
    ", we carried out such simulations for a binary - planetary system with a solar - type star as its primary , a jupiter - sized object at 5 au as its planetary companion , and a 0.5 - 1.5 solar - masses star as its secondary . in these simulations",
    ", we assumed that planetesimal formation has been efficient and has resulted in the formation of a disk of approximately 115 planetary embryos with masses ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 earth - masses .",
    "we randomly distributed these objects between 0.5 au and 4 au by 3 to 6 mutual hill radii , and considered the increase in their masses with their semimajor axes @xmath2 and the number of their mutual hill radii @xmath3 follow @xcite , and be given by @xmath4 .",
    "the surface density of our disk model , normalized to a density of 8.2 g/@xmath5 at 1 au , was assumed to follow an @xmath6 profile , where @xmath7 is the radial distance from the primary star .",
    "we also assumed that the water to mass ratios of embryos followed the current distribution of water in primitive asteroids of the asteroid belt @xcite .",
    "that is , embryos inside 2 au were taken to be dry , the ones between 2 and 2.5 au were considered to contain 1% water , and those beyond 2.5 au were assumed to have water to mass ratios of 5% @xcite .",
    "we simulated the collisional growth of the planetary embryos of our binary - planetary system for 100 myr , and for different values of the semimajor axis @xmath8 , orbital eccentricity @xmath9 , and mass of the secondary star .",
    "we followed @xcite , and considered a conservative habitable zone for the primary of our system at a distance between 0.9 au and 1.5 au from this star .",
    "figure 1 shows the results of some of our simulations for an equal - mass binary with solar - type stars .",
    "as shown here , terrestrial - class planets with substantial amounts of water can form in the habitable zone of the primary star .",
    "an important result obtained from our simulations was the relation between the binary perihelion @xmath10 and the location of the outermost terrestrial planet @xmath11 .",
    "the left graph of figure 2 shows this for different simulations .",
    "as shown here , in simulations with no giant planet , similar to @xcite , terrestrial planet formation favors regions interior to @xmath12 .",
    "given the location of the inner edge of the habitable zone ( i.e. , 0.9 au ) , our simulations indicated that , in a binary - planetary system with a sun - like primary , a stellar companion with a perihelion distance smaller than 0.9/0.19 = 4.7 au@xmath135 au may not allow earth - like planets to form in the system s habitable zone . in simulations with giant planets , on the other hand ,",
    "figure 2 shows that terrestrial planets form closer - in .",
    "the ratio @xmath14 in these systems varies between 0.06 and 0.13 .    a detailed analysis of the results of our simulations",
    "indicate that the systems , in which water - bearing planets were formed in their habitable zones , have relatively large perihelia .",
    "the right graph of figure 2 shows this for simulations in a binary with equal - mass sun - like stars .",
    "the circles in this figure correspond to systems in which simulations resulted in the formation of habitable planets .",
    "the numbers on the top of the circles represent the mean eccentricity of the giant planet during the simulation . for comparison ,",
    "the systems in which the giant planet is unstable have also been marked . since at the beginning of each simulation ,",
    "the orbit of the giant planet was considered to be circular , a non - zero eccentricity is indicative of the interaction of this body with the secondary star .",
    "as shown here , earth - like objects are formed in systems where the average eccentricity of the giant planet is small .",
    "that is , in systems where the interaction between the giant planet and the secondary star has been weak .",
    "that implies , habitable planet formation is more favorable in binaries with moderate to large perihelia , and with giant planets on low eccentricity orbits .",
