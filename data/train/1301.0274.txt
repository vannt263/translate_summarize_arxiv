    "since its discovery by @xcite grs  1915 + 105 remains one of the most intensively studied of all the galactic x - ray sources , and is the prototypical galactic ` microquasar ' .",
    "this system is of particular importance , not only for our understanding of the formation of jets near black holes , but also because it is regarded as a galactic analogue to active galactic nuclei @xcite . due to its location only 0.2 arcsec from the galactic plane ,",
    "grs  1915 + 105 suffers from strong interstellar absorption : the _ v_-band extinction ( @xmath0 ) is @xmath1 mag @xcite .",
    "for this reason observations in the _ k_-band have been particularly critical , leading to the identification of the secondary @xcite , a radial velocity estimate for the secondary @xcite and the possible determination of a photometric period @xcite .",
    "the radial velocity study yielded a mass function of @xmath2 @xmath3 which , when combined with inclination estimates @xcite indicated a primary mass of @xmath4 @xmath3 .",
    "this not only confirmed the presence of a black hole in the system but indicated it to be one the most massive black holes discovered to date in a galactic x - ray binary .",
    "other examples of massive primaries include cygnus x-1 with a primary mass of @xmath5 @xmath3 @xcite and v404 cyg , which until recently was thought to harbour a @xmath6 @xmath3 @xcite but has now been reduced to @xmath7 @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "+ following the estimate by @xcite , @xcite noted that this mass falls outside the theoretical distribution range for our galaxy as calculated by @xcite .",
    "however , since the error on the black hole mass is so large ( @xmath8 @xmath3 ) , it is clear that a more accurate estimate is required before we can make a meaningful comparison to the theoretical mass distribution .",
    "in addition , @xcite derive a lower limit for the dimensionless spin parameter of @xmath9 making grs 1915 + 105 a near maximally spinning kerr black hole .",
    "this conclusion was drawn from an analysis of rxte and asca data for the thermal state of grs  1915 + 105 , and a model of the x - ray continuum of a fully relativistic accretion disc . as discussed by @xcite , determining the mass of , and distance to , grs  1915 + 105 is of fundamental importance for verifying this method of spin determination .",
    "+    [ table : data ]    here we present an analysis of archival very large telescope ( vlt ) data and a re - analysis of the data presented by @xcite . in particular , we show in what follows that , near orbital phase 0.25 , the absorption lines are corrupted by emission , which will have a significant effect on the amplitude of the radial velocity variation .",
    "we discuss possible origins for this emission , and the effect it might have on the mass function and primary mass .",
    "we also discuss the feasibility of using _",
    "h_band spectroscopy to measure the radial velocity of the secondary from narrower atomic features using new gemini observations .",
    "the european southern observatory ( eso ) archival data used here were taken with the infrared spectrometer and array camera ( isaac ) on the 8-m vlt antu telescope at cerro paranal ( chile ) .",
    "the short wavelength arm of isaac equipped with a @xmath10 pixel rockwell hgcdte array with an image scale of 0.147 arcsec pixel@xmath11 . using the medium resolution grating ( 1.2   pixel@xmath11 in the @xmath12-band ) yields a spectral resolution of @xmath133000 with a 1 arcsec slit .",
    "science data consisted of several 250300 s individual exposures each night ( see table [ table : data ] for summary of the data used ) .",
    "we present a re - analysis of 16 nights of observations from 2000 may to august , which were the focus of @xcite , and 13 more from 2002 july to september which are presented here for the first time . + the bias subtraction",
    ", flat - fielding and sky subtraction were performed using the  package .",
    "the spectra were extracted using the  package .",
    "initial wavelength calibration was carried out using arc spectra obtained before or after each science run . however , cross - correlation of these spectra with the oh sky lines indicated a residual wavelength offset of @xmath1435 @xmath15 , presumably due to flexure in the telescope / spectrograph between the times when science exposures and calibration arc frames were taken .",
    "this wavelength shift was corrected for before the telluric features were removed . to correct for telluric absorption",
    "the a0 v star hd 179913 was observed either before or after the science exposures each night and the method as outlined by @xcite utilized .",
    "days ( marked with open circles ) .",
    "the fit overlaid has a reduced @xmath16 .",
    "the peak occurs at @xmath17 km @xmath18 with a systemic velocity of @xmath19 km @xmath18 .",
    "as can be clearly seen the phasing of the dataset with the ephemeris of @xcite leads to an offset in the peak from the expected 0.25 to @xmath130.5 .",
    "also plotted is the same data folded on our refined ephemeris ( marked with crosses ) from the combined dataset ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "note that the refined ephemeris exhibits no significant offset from the expected peak of 0.25 . ]",
    "the data were exported to where they were re - binned onto a common velocity scale .",
    "three techniques were then used to measure the radial velocity curve : each spectrum of grs  1915 + 105 was cross correlated against ( i ) a template spectrum of the kiii standard star hr 8117 , ( ii ) the average of the ( remaining ) spectra of grs  1915 + 105 and ( iii ) the average of the spectra occurring around phase 0.75 ( see below ) .",
    "all three techniques resulted in similar velocities within the errors .",
    "+ as a final check , the spectra were also re - extracted using the vlt isaac pipeline , and the resulting radial velocities were again found to be consistent with those determined above once the shift due to instrument flexure had been removed .      in @xcite the presence of atomic absorption features are identified in the _ h_-band .",
    "motivated by the hope that a radial velocity measurement based on these inherently narrower features would lead to a more accurate and reliable mass function estimate , a total of three pathfinder spectra were obtained using gemini - north s near - infrared integral field spectrometer on the nights of 2010 june 29th , july 6th and july 13th .",
    "the observations were scheduled to sample the radial velocity variation at three orbital phases .",
    "nifs provides 3d imaging spectroscopy with a @xmath20 field of view , equipped with a @xmath21 rockwell hawaii-2rg hgcdte array with an image scale of @xmath22per pixel across and along the slit respectively . using the h - g5604 grating and the hk-60603 filter yields a spectral resolution of @xmath135000 .",
    "science data consisted of @xmath23s target exposures each night resulting in a s / n @xmath1324 .",
    "the data were reduced using the  package and telluric absorption corrected for by observing the a0v standard hd  182761 before and after science runs .",
    "the data were again exported to  where they were re - binned onto a common velocity scale .",
    "the spectra were then cross correlated against the ki iii template star hd 83240 , taken from the catalogue of high resolution vlt ir spectra of @xcite .",
    "a stringent mask of the spectra was used in each case to utilise only the lines identified in figure [ fig : spech ] for the cross correlation .",
    "days obtained from the lomb - scargle periodogram . the overlaid fit has a reduced @xmath16 .",
    "the peak occurs at @xmath24 km @xmath18 with a systemic velocity of @xmath25 km @xmath18 .",
    "the scaling of error bars to produce a reduced @xmath16 makes the 2002 error bars larger than those in figure 1 .",
    "this is due to the larger scatter of the points in the combined dataset . ]    in figure [ fig : rv02 ] we plot the previously unpublished data from 2002 only , folded using the ephemeris of @xcite .",
    "the maximum velocity shift is seen to occur at phase 0.5 , whereas it should occur at phase 0.25 by definition , suggesting that a refinement in the ephemeris of @xcite is needed .",
    "both the 2000 and 2002 datasets yield radial velocity amplitudes consistent with the result of @xmath26 km @xmath18 found by @xcite , although the systemic velocity ( @xmath27 ) differs somewhat to the previously published value of @xmath28 km @xmath18 .",
    "this difference is most likely due to the skyline correction outlined in section 2.1 as prior to this correction we find a systemic velocity that is consistent with that of @xcite for the same dataset .",
    "+ we next combined both the 2000 and 2002 datasets in order to derive an improved ephemeris by performing a period analysis via a lomb - scargle periodogram and then refining the results using bretthorst s bayesian periodogram @xcite to clean out any false signals , the results of which are shown in figure [ fig : lomb ] ( calculated using @xmath29 from @xcite ) .",
    "the peak that corresponds to a period of @xmath30 is the only one to successfully phase all the data consistently and so we adopt this as our revised orbital period for grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "this period is consistent with that of @xcite ( @xmath31 days ) to within 1@xmath32 , but does not agree with the low amplitude _",
    "k_band modulation discussed by @xcite .",
    "folding all the data on this revised period yields the radial velocity curve shown in figure [ fig : rv0002 ] .",
    "a sinewave fit to this plot yields a secondary radial velocity semi - amplitude ( @xmath33 ) of @xmath34 km @xmath18 and a systemic velocity ( @xmath27 ) of @xmath25 km @xmath18 . to estimate the uncertainties on derived quantities",
    ", we used a monte carlo analysis .",
    "this involved selecting 100000 random samples from distributions of each input parameter _",
    "i _ , @xmath33 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( based on their means and standard deviations ) , and calculating the results based on the output distributions . combining our initial estimates in @xmath35 and @xmath37 with the suggested donor mass ( @xmath36 ) of @xmath38 @xmath3 @xcite and the binary inclination ( _ i _ ) of @xmath39 degrees @xcite the mass function : @xmath40 is found to be @xmath41 ( at the 68 per cent confidence interval ) , which is slightly lower than the @xmath2 @xmath3 determined by @xcite , but consistent within their @xmath42 error .",
    "the mass of the primary is found to be @xmath43 @xmath44 .",
    "+    however , in figure [ fig : sine ] we plot the trailed spectra for the combined dataset phased on our refined ephemeris : emission can be seen in the first half of the orbital range , indicated by the lighter regions , blueward of all the co bandhead absorption features ( this is more apparent in the electronic colour version ) .",
    "the emission rises and falls over the first half of the orbit and is predominantly strongest near phase 0.25 . to demonstrate this emission more clearly , in figures [ fig : aver00 ] & [ fig : aver02 ] we plot the summed spectra , phased on the revised ephemeris , for both the 2000 and 2002 datasets . in each case the data is further separated into two distinct orbital phase windows ( 0.15 - 0.35 and 0.65 - 0.85 ) to illustrate the presence and absence of the emission near 0.25 and 0.75 respectively . as can be clearly seen , there is significant co bandhead emission present in the first half of the orbital phase range , not in the latter .",
    "this emission is present in the two epochs of observation ( most noticeably near the @xmath45 ( 2 - 0 ) and ( 3 - 1 ) transitions ) indicating that it is not just a transient phenomenon . whereas variability in the bandhead absorption had been reported by previous authors @xcite , the fact that it occurs predominantly near orbital phase 0.25 has important implications for the radial velocity curve , which we discuss in section 4 .",
    "+      from our nifs spectra ( see figure [ fig : spech ] ) we confirm the presence of many of the atomic features noted by @xcite : namely the al triplet ( @xmath46  , @xmath47  , @xmath48  ) , si i ( @xmath49  , @xmath50  ) , mg i ( @xmath51  , @xmath52  , @xmath53  , @xmath54  ) , fe i ( @xmath55  , @xmath56  , @xmath57  ) and oh ( @xmath58  ) .",
    "equivalent widths of some of the major lines can be found in table [ table : data2 ] .",
    "we do not detect br series ( @xmath59 or @xmath60 ) , co or he i. we first used these spectra to independently estimate the effective temperature ( @xmath61 ) of the secondary , from equation 3 of @xcite , using the ew of the mg i ( @xmath54  ) line . from this",
    "we estimate an @xmath62 of @xmath63 k which is reassuringly consistent with the k2 iii classification already ascribed by @xcite .",
    "+ the resulting velocities from our cross correlation analysis ( see section 2.2 for details ) are shown in table [ table : data2 ] .",
    "these were then searched for the expected variation due to the motion of the secondary , based on the results of the _",
    "k_band observations outlined in section 3.1 .",
    "however , even with the improvement in the error of the ephemeris ( section 3.1 ) , over the intervening 110 cycles between the _ k _ & _ h_band observations the uncertainty in phase information accumulates to @xmath640.33 .",
    "hence , in constraining @xmath37 , the absolute phase was left as a free parameter .",
    "we used the @xmath65 velocity found in section 3.1 . to our surprise , we do not find the radial velocity variation expected , based on the co band - head measurements discussed in section 3.1 and @xcite .",
    "our measurements are consistent only with an upper limit of @xmath6650 km s@xmath67 on @xmath37 , although this depends strongly on the assumed value of @xmath27 .",
    "it is clear that some caution should be used when interpreting the radial velocity variation ( or lack thereof ) in the _",
    "h_-band , as we have only three measurements at our disposal .",
    "if the lack of variation ( compared to what is expected from the _ k_band ) is real , then we must look for alternative sources of the _ h_-band emission .",
    "for example , the work of @xcite and @xcite suggests that grs  1915 + 105 may possess a circumbinary disc of material : if we assume such a disc is the source of the _ h_-band absorption features , then we can use the fwhm of the latter to constrain the location of the emission .",
    "the observed fwhm of the absorption features is @xmath6660 km s@xmath67 , and assuming a keplerian disc orbiting a binary of total mass 12.8 @xmath68 , we estimate a radius of 530 @xmath69 , well outside the binary radius of 100 @xmath69 .",
    "however , it remains suspicious that the _ h_-band spectrum , despite the lack of radial velocity variation , so closely matches the expected spectral type of the secondary .",
    "it is clear that more systematic observations of these spectral features are warranted .",
    "+      the co emission is a rare phenomenon in accreting binary systems : to our knowledge , it has only previously been observed in the well known cataclysmic variable wz sagittae @xcite . as with @xcite , we also believe that h pfund emission is unlikely to be a major contributor to the observed emission . higher order lines ( @xmath70 p 33 ) blend to form a continuum at shorter wavelengths ( see figure [ fig : aver00 ] ) and do not exhibit the discrete band structure blueward of each co bandhead that is observed . also , the intensity of pfund emission lines should increase from shorter to longer wavelengths , whereas the emission that we observe is approximately uniform at each site .",
    "hence we believe that co bandhead emission is the best explanation for the observed emission features .",
    "+ with a dissociation energy of 11.1 ev , the site of this emission must reside in a relatively cool , outer part of the disc .",
    "such a region can not be directly illuminated by x - rays from the inner disc , and must instead be shielded from it .",
    "this could be provided , for example , by a warped accretion disc , which in turn has been invoked to explain the long term periodicities in the x - ray light curve of grs  1915 + 105 @xcite .",
    "+ however , it is the fact that the emission occurs preferentially near orbital phase 0.25 that most interests us here .",
    "such emission may become more visible near this phase because the absorption lines of the secondary are at their maximum redshift at this phase , making emission from the accretion disc easier to observe .",
    "however , the same should be true at maximum blue shift ( phase 0.75 ) , which is not the case for our data .",
    "+ alternatively , it may simply be that the shielded region of the disc is best visible near binary phase 0.25 - although , in the context of a warped and precessing disc @xcite , it is not clear why this should be the case for both epochs of observations .",
    "another possible cause for the appearance of the blueshifted emission phenomenon is p - cygni type emission originating from a wind driven outflow of material , such as proposed by @xcite for grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "this would imply a shell of material somewhere between 200 - 400 @xmath71 from the primary ( @xcite , equation 1 ) .",
    "the dominant source of uncertainty for this estimate , however , is due to the uncertainty in the distance to the binary .",
    "+    the uncertainty in the distance to grs  1915 + 105 also plays a significant role in any attempt to tightly constrain the black hole mass .",
    "this is because the estimate for the primary mass stated in section 3.1 relies heavily on the inclination of the system . while cited by many authors as @xmath72 @xcite , this estimate",
    "is based in turn on an accurately known distance .",
    "however , the distance to grs  1915 + 105 is still a matter of some debate ; the conservative estimate of @xmath73 kpc as proposed by @xcite would suggest a binary inclination of @xmath74 ( using equation 4 from @xcite ) .",
    "combining this with a donor mass of @xmath38 @xmath3 @xcite , yields a considerably more uncertain primary mass of @xmath75 @xmath44 . + to estimate the distance to grs  1915 + 105",
    ", @xcite combined their estimate of @xmath27 with the galactic rotation curve of @xcite to yield @xmath76  kpc . using the same technique , our estimate of @xmath27 ( see section 3.1 ) yields @xmath77  kpc , where the low error is due to the fact that we assume a flat rotation curve and thereby only the uncertainty on @xmath27 contributes .",
    "this in turn would suggest an inclination of @xmath78 ( again from @xcite ) , and a primary mass of @xmath79 @xmath44 .",
    "+ finally , it is also clear that the black hole mass estimate will also be affected by the presence of the bandhead emission . specifically , near phase 0.25",
    ", the absorption line measurements will be skewed to higher velocities , artificially increasing the amplitude of the radial velocity curve .",
    "in addition , the presence of the bandhead emission will also affect the measurement of @xmath27 in the same manner .",
    "hence , in this sense , the mass function we have derived must be considered an upper limit only .",
    "further attempts to refine the mass function and @xmath27 of grs  1915 + 105 utilizing _",
    "k_-band spectroscopy will depend on the feasibility of decontaminating the absorption features from this emission contribution , especially near phase 0.25 .",
    "this will require higher resolution and s / n spectra than have been obtained thus far .",
    "we have confirmed the presence of narrow atomic features in the _ h_-band as noted by @xcite , but our analysis does not provide evidence for the expected radial velocity variation .",
    "this may suggest that the origin of the absorption is distinct from the secondary and outside of the binary but more observations are clearly required to confirm this .",
    "alternatively , the co bandhead emission observed specifically at phase 0.25 brings into question the reliability of the radial velocity amplitude of the secondary based on the _ k_-band observations .",
    "higher resolution _",
    "k_-band observations are required to disentangle the emission from the bandhead absorption so that a reliable radial velocity estimate can be made .",
