    "the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model , first proposed by pierre guichon  @xcite , has been extensively developed and applied to various nuclear phenomena with tremendous success  @xcite .",
    "the qmc model can provide the medium modification of nucleon structure based on the quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "in fact , the evidence for the change of nucleon structure may be observed in polarization transfer measurements of the quasi - elastic ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) reaction at the jefferson laboratory and mami  @xcite .",
    "it also seems vital to consider the internal structure change of nucleon to understand the nuclear emc effect  @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", a major breakthrough occurred in the problem of nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath2-@xmath2 ) force by introducing the concept of effective field theory ( eft ) or chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite .",
    "it gives a low - energy scenario that pions and nucleons ( and possibly deltas ) interact via a force governed by spontaneously broken , approximate chiral symmetry .",
    "it is thus important to incorporate chiral symmetry into the qmc model , and it may be achieved by using the volume - coupling version of the cloudy bag model ( cbm )  @xcite . here , we propose a qmc model with chiral symmetry ( we call it the chiral qmc ( cqmc ) model  @xcite ) , and discuss the relationship between the cqmc and chpt .",
    "using a unitary transformation , @xmath3 $ ] , the chiral bag model , which is given in terms of the mit bag with the surface interaction between the confined quarks and pions  @xcite , is transformed to a more practical form , that is the volume - coupling version of cbm  @xcite : _ cbm = _ v - _ s + ( d _ ) ^2 + l_b , [ chiralv - lag ] with @xmath4 the quark field , @xmath5 the pion field , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 mev ) the pion decay constant , @xmath9 the bag constant , @xmath10 the step function for the bag and @xmath11 the surface @xmath12-function . here , @xmath13 is the covariant derivative , and @xmath14 .",
    "the last term , @xmath15 , describes the symmetry breaking terms including the @xmath16 quark mass , @xmath17 , and the pion mass , @xmath18 mev ) .",
    "linearizing the pion field and introducing the gluon field , @xmath19 , the lagrangian density reads @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the usual , bag lagrangian density , and the interaction is @xmath22 \\psi \\ , \\theta_v   , \\label{int - lag}\\ ] ] with @xmath23 the su(3 ) color generators and @xmath24 the quark - gluon coupling constant . the free pion field and the gluon are , respectively , described by @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the one - gluon exchange ( oge ) contribution to the hadron mass is split into the color electric ( @xmath27 ) and magnetic ( @xmath28 ) parts , and the latter is important  @xcite .",
    "this magnetic force differently contributes to the @xmath29 and @xmath30 hyperons , because the @xmath31 and @xmath32 quarks in @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) are in the spin - singlet ( triplet ) state  @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xmath28 lowers both masses of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , but the mass reduction for @xmath29 is much larger than for @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the second - order energy correction caused by the pion - quark interaction in eq.([int - lag ] ) is calculated by the hubbard s prescription . in refs.@xcite ,",
    "the hartree - fock ( hf ) contribution to the hadron mass is considered .    in the actual calculation , we fix the @xmath31 , @xmath32 quark mass , @xmath33 mev .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the usual @xmath34 parameters for the @xmath2 and @xmath35 are the same , namely @xmath36 .",
    "then , the bag constant , @xmath9 , and @xmath37 are determined so as to fit the free nucleon mass , @xmath38 mev ) , with its bag radius , @xmath39 fm .",
    "the remaining parameter , @xmath24 , is chosen so as to generate the correct mass difference between @xmath40 and the @xmath35 mass , @xmath41 mev ) .",
    "lastly , we use the strange quark mass , @xmath42 , to fit the @xmath43 mass ( @xmath44 mev ) .",
    "we then study two cases where the pion - cloud effect is included ( case @xmath45 ) or not included ( case @xmath46 ) .",
    "the bag parameters for the case @xmath45 or @xmath46 are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the n-@xmath35 mass difference ( about @xmath47 mev ) is mainly reproduced by the oge contribution ( about @xmath48 mev ) .",
    "in contrast , the pion - cloud contribution is about @xmath49 mev , which is near the upper limit allowed from lattice qcd constraints  @xcite .",
    "we also calculate the mass of hyperon ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , or @xmath50 ) . in such calculation , we take a different @xmath34 parameter for each hyperon and fit the calculated mass to the observed value in free space  @xcite .",
    "to describe a nuclear matter , we need the intermediate attractive and short - range repulsive nuclear forces . as in the usual qmc model  @xcite",
    ", it may be achieved by introducing the @xmath51 and @xmath52 mesons .",
    "the present @xmath51 meson represents , in some way , the exchange of two pions in the iso - scalar @xmath2-@xmath2 interaction .    assuming mean - field approximation ( mfa ) ,",
    "let us add the lagrangian density @xmath53 \\psi \\ , \\theta_v    + \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\partial_\\mu { \\bar \\sigma})^2 - \\frac{1}{2 } m_\\sigma^2 { \\bar \\sigma}^2 - \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\partial_\\mu { \\bar \\omega})^2    + \\frac{1}{2 } m_\\omega^2 { \\bar \\omega}^2 ,   \\label{qmc - lag2}\\ ] ] to @xmath54 . here , @xmath55 is the @xmath56-quark coupling constant , @xmath57 is the @xmath56 meson mass , and @xmath58 is the mean - field value of the @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) meson in matter . the lagrangian density at the hadron level is then given by  @xcite _ cqmc = |n n + ( _ ) ^2 - m_^2 |^2 - ( _ ) ^2 + m_^2 |^2 , [ chiral-3 ] with @xmath2 the nucleon field and @xmath59 . note that the classical pion field vanishes in the nuclear ground state .",
    "the effective nucleon mass , @xmath60 , is calculated by using the cbm , and it is given as a function of @xmath61 : m_n^(| ) = m_n - g_(| ) | ,   g_(| ) = g _ , [ m - star ] where @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the scalar polarizability .    in a uniformly distributed nuclear matter , the derivative term of the meson field vanishes .",
    "thus , the meson field is no longer dynamical but just auxiliary .",
    "the classical meson field is thus replaced by the nucleon density , @xmath64 , or the nucleon scalar density , @xmath65 .",
    "using eq.([m - star ] ) , we find g _ = ( n^n ) ,   g _ = , [ replace ] where @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "then , the lagrangian density reads _",
    "cqmc & = & |n n + l_4n + l_hot , + l_4n & = & ( |n n)^2 - ( n^n)^2 , + l_hot & = & - a ( |n n)^3 + a^2 ( |n n)^4 + . [",
    "chiral - n ] this is equivalent to the chiral effective lagrangian in mfa  @xcite .",
    "the last term , @xmath68 , gives higher - order terms , which describe the effect of many - body forces as studied in ref.@xcite , and it is related to the internal structure of nucleon , namely the scalar polarizability . note that @xmath69 in eq.([replace ] ) is about 0.3 at normal nuclear density , @xmath70 @xmath71 .    in the numerical calculation for symmetric nuclear matter , we take @xmath72 mev and @xmath73 mev , and the @xmath51-n and @xmath52-n coupling constants , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , are determined so as to fit the nuclear saturation condition ( @xmath76 mev ) at @xmath77  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rmas ] , we present the baryon mass at the nuclear density , @xmath78 .    the scaling law for hadron masses in the simple qmc  @xcite is apparently violated by the hyperfine interaction .",
    "in fact , the @xmath30 and @xmath29 masses are split up in matter , and the @xmath2-@xmath35 mass difference is very enhanced by the color magnetic interaction .",
    "the pion - cloud effect is relatively minor in the baryon spectra .",
    "we have also discussed the ( mean - field ) potential for the hyperon in a nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "recently , the concept of eft is widely accepted .",
    "the scenario of low - energy qcd is characterized by pions and nucleons interacting through a force constrained by approximate chiral symmetry . in chpt , the effective chiral lagrangian relevant to the @xmath2-@xmath2 force",
    "is given by @xmath79 , where the superscript refers to the number of chiral dimension and the ellipsis stands for terms of chiral third order or higher  @xcite .",
    "at the lowest and leading order , the @xmath80 lagrangian density is given by ^(2 ) _",
    "= , [ pi - pi ] with @xmath81 $ ] , and the @xmath82 lagrangian density is ^(1)_n = |n n , [ pi - n ] with the axial vector coupling constant , @xmath83 .",
    "low energy constants , @xmath84 , appear in the terms of dimension 2 or higher in @xmath85 .",
    "in contrast , the nuclear force in the cqmc is described by the exchange of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 mesons , which are introduced _ by hand_. however , even in the cqmc , instead of assuming the @xmath51 , it may be possible to obtain the intermediate attractive force by calculating the two - pion exchange ( tpe ) diagrams between two nucleons .",
    "in fact , the lagrangian density , eq.([chiralv - lag ] ) , generates ( or generalizes ) the weinberg lagrangian  @xcite .    in chpt , the attractive , central force , @xmath86 , is calculated by the tpe contributions at third order . in configuration space",
    ", it may be written by the dispersion relation  @xcite v_c(r ) = _ 2m_^d _ c ( ) , [ disp ] where @xmath87 is the mass spectrum given by the imaginary part of the potential in momentum space , and it consists of terms with @xmath88 or @xmath89 .",
    "thus , when a nucleon is located at @xmath90 , the scalar field at @xmath91 is given by ( r , r ) = _ 2m_^d_c ( ) dk , [ scalar - field ] where @xmath92 .",
    "we then find the scalar mean - field , @xmath61 , created by a uniform distribution of nucleons with density @xmath78 as = _ b dr ( r , r ) = _ b _ 2m_^d .",
    "[ mean - scalar - field ] when the fermi motion of nucleons is considered , the result is given by eq.([mean - scalar - field ] ) with the nucleon scalar density @xmath93 , instead of @xmath78 , in matter .",
    "as in the qmc , this constant mean - field acts on the quark inside a nucleon as an attractive force , and modifies the quark wavefunction .",
    "such change generates a variation of @xmath94 depending on @xmath61 .",
    "thus , we find the self - consistency condition for @xmath61 = _ s _ 2m_^d - _ s , [ scc ] where , in the right hand side of eq.([scc ] ) , we assumed the simplest case , namely @xmath95 . in this case , the scalar polarizability is given by @xmath96 .",
    "because of the decrease of @xmath83 in matter , the mean - central potential , @xmath97 , is weakened for high @xmath78 . in fact , the cqmc predicts @xmath98 with @xmath99  @xcite .",
    "this effect is truly caused by the internal structure of nucleon , and concerns the saturation of nuclear matter .",
    "the reduction of the central force in matter may be favorable , because recent calculations for a nuclear matter show that the n@xmath100lo potential based on eft produces a deep overbinding at large @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "we have proposed a quark - meson coupling model with chiral symmetry .",
    "we have studied the effect of pion and gluon exchanges on the baryon mass in a nuclear matter , and also discussed the relationship between the cqmc and chpt .",
    "the mean - central potential is modified by the internal structure change of nucleon .",
    "it may be possible to extend the cqmc to include @xmath35-particles explicitly  @xcite , and construct a @xmath35-full eft  @xcite based on the quark model .",
