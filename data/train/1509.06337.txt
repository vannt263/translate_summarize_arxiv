    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) accelerator and its four experiments have previously provided extensive experimental evidence to confirm the formation of a deconfined state of nuclear matter , referred to as the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , in the initial stages of high - energy heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "currently , a major objective in the field of high - energy nuclear physics is to characterize the properties of the qgp in a quantitative way .",
    "the @xmath0 meson is a useful probe for studying the qgp properties , because it is sensitive to several aspects of the collision , including modifications of strangeness production in bulk matter  @xcite . due to its small inelastic cross section for interaction with nonstrange hadrons  @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath0 meson is less affected by late hadronic rescattering and may reflect the initial evolution of the system .",
    "being composed of a nearly pure strange anti - strange ( @xmath8 ) state , the @xmath0 meson puts additional constraints on models of quark recombination in the qgp .",
    "the study of the qgp typically involves comparisons of different observables measured in nucleus - nucleus ( a@xmath1b ) collisions and in proton - proton ( ) collisions at the same center - of - mass energy .",
    "modifications in the a@xmath1b collisions with respect to collisions could be interpreted as being due to the hot nuclear matter ( hnm )  possibly qgp  being produced . however , nuclear modifications could be present in the initial state of the collisions even if no qgp is produced .",
    "these effects , typically referred to as cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) , may include the modification of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in a nucleus  @xcite , initial - state energy loss  @xcite , and the cronin effect , which is often attributed to multiple scattering of the incoming parton inside the target nucleus  @xcite .",
    "cnm effects can be probed with collisions .",
    "phenix has previously measured @xmath0 meson production in collisions at forward , mid- and backward rapidities  @xcite .",
    "suppression was observed in the forward ( @xmath7-going ) direction , where small - x partons from the au nucleus are probed , and an enhancement was seen in the backward ( au - going ) direction .",
    "similar behavior was previously observed for inclusive charged hadrons and open heavy flavor in collisions  @xcite , potentially indicating similar particle production and modification mechanisms .",
    "the rapidity dependence @xmath9 of particle production in asymmetric collisions with a smaller - a projectile and a large - a target , provides a way to investigate both hot and cold nuclear - matter effects .",
    "previous @xmath10 meson data in cu@xmath1au collisions  @xcite showed that the ratio of forward ( @xmath11 , or cu - going ) to backward ( @xmath12 , or au - going ) @xmath10 modification was comparable in both sign and magnitude to that expected from cnm effects .",
    "the @xmath0 meson is composed of lighter closed flavor ( @xmath8 ) and its production from 1.0 gev/@xmath6 to 5.0 gev/@xmath6 involves a mix of soft and hard processes and would provide a link between heavy flavor and lighter mesons .",
    "comparison of the @xmath0 meson production in cu@xmath1au and systems and to @xmath10 production in cu@xmath1au collisions may shed light on the mixture of hnm and cnm effects on @xmath0-meson production .",
    "the production of @xmath0 mesons has already been measured at phenix in , , cu@xmath1cu , and at midrapidity  @xcite and in and at forward and backward rapidities  @xcite over a wide range in .",
    "previous measurements from and cu@xmath1cu collisions  @xcite in a similar momentum range were found to be consistent with hnm effects and exhibited large flow anisotropies .",
    "the star collaboration has also previously measured @xmath0 meson production at midrapidity in cu@xmath1cu and collisions  @xcite . @xmath0",
    "meson production has also been measured by the alice collaboration at large rapidity in and @xmath13@xmath1pb collisions  @xcite and at midrapidity in collisions  @xcite .    in this paper , the production of @xmath0 mesons is determined at forward and backward rapidities via dimuons reconstructed in the phenix muon spectrometers in cu@xmath1au collisions at = 200  gev recorded in 2012 .",
    "the particle multiplicity at these rapidities in heavy - ion collisions results in large combinatorial backgrounds and produces a challenging environment for @xmath0 meson measurements .",
    "previous measurements were thus limited to smaller collision species . a procedure for removing the background is detailed and a measurement of the @xmath0 meson nuclear modification factor @xmath14 in cu@xmath1au collisions at forward and backward rapidities is presented versus @xmath9 , , and the number of participating nucleons .",
    "the phenix detector is described in detail in  @xcite , and a schematic of the 2012 setup is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : phenix ] .",
    "this analysis uses the dimuon decay channel of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "the detectors relevant for this measurement are forward and backward muon spectrometers  @xcite , the two beam - beam counters ( bbcs )  @xcite , the silicon vertex tracker ( vtx )  @xcite , and the forward silicon vertex detector ( fvtx )  @xcite .",
    "( color online ) the 2012 setup of the phenix detector . ]",
    "this study used minimum bias ( mb ) events triggered by the bbcs .",
    "the bbcs comprise two arrays of 64 erenkov counters covering the pseudorapidity range @xmath15 .",
    "the mb trigger required two or more counters firing on each side and a @xmath16-vertex selection around the nominal center of the detector acceptance  @xcite .",
    "the mb trigger fired on 93@xmath173% of the 5.2@xmath170.2 b total inelastic cu+au cross section . in this case , the @xmath16-vertex was measured by the bbcs with a resolution of @xmath180.52.0  cm , depending on the event multiplicity .",
    "the collision point is determined in @xmath19 , @xmath9 and @xmath16 by the two vertex detectors , vtx and fvtx , with a resolution of better than 100 microns .",
    "the vtx and fvtx detectors were installed in 2011 and 2012 to provide precise particle vertexing and tracking in the central and forward / backward rapidities .",
    "covering approximately the same rapidity range as the existing muon spectrometers , the fvtx is composed of two endcaps , each with four stations that are perpendicular to the beamline and composed of silicon mini - strip sensors that have a 75 micron pitch in the radial direction and lengths in the @xmath0 direction varying from 3.4 mm to 11.5 mm .",
    "the vtx , which surrounds the collision region at phenix , comprises four layers of silicon sensors . the inner two layers and outer two layers",
    "are composed of 30 pixel ladders and 44 stripixel ladders , respectively .",
    "the muon system is separated into the north and south muon arms .",
    "each arm comprises four subcomponents : an absorber material , a magnet , a muon tracker ( mutr ) , and a muon identifier ( muid ) .",
    "initially , the absorbers were composed of 19 cm copper and 60 cm iron , but an additional 36.2 cm of stainless steel was added in 2010 to help decrease the hadronic background . following the absorber in each muon arm is the mutr , which comprises three sets of cathode strip chambers in a radial magnetic field with an integrated bending power of 0.8 t@xmath20 m .",
    "the final component is the muid , which comprises five alternating steel absorbers and iarocci tubes to further reduce the number of punch - through hadrons that can be mistakenly identified as muons .",
    "the backplates of the magnets provide the first absorber layer for the muon identifier systems .",
    "the backplate of the south muon magnet is 10 cm shorter than the backplate of the north muon magnet , resulting in less total absorber material in the south arm than the north arm , and thus a slightly different momentum acceptance .",
    "the muon spectrometers cover the pseudorapidity range @xmath21 over the full azimuth .",
    "muon candidates are identified by reconstructed tracks in the mutr matched to muid tracks , where at least one of the tracks from a pair of muon candidates in the same event penetrates through to the last muid plane . the minimum momentum needed for a muon to reach",
    "the last muid plane is @xmath223 gev/@xmath6 .",
    "in this analysis , @xmath0 meson candidates are selected from two reconstructed muons in the rhic cu@xmath1au dataset from 2012 .",

    "was estimated by a glauber simulation to be 5.2@xmath170.2 b.    a set of quality assurance cuts is applied to the data to select good muon candidates and improve the signal - to - background ratio .",

    "the collision z - vertex is required to be within @xmath1710 cm of the center of the interaction region along the beam direction , as measured with the bbcs .",
    "the mutr tracks are required to match the muid tracks at the first muid layer in both position and angle .",
    "in addition , only dimuon candidates in which at least one track penetrated to the final muid layer are selected .",
    "furthermore , the track is required to have greater than a minimum number of possible hits in the mutr and muid , and a maximum allowed @xmath25 is applied to both the track and vertex determination .",
    "there is a minimum allowed single muon momentum along the beam axis , @xmath26 , which is reconstructed and energy - loss corrected at the collision vertex .",
    "finally , this analysis is restricted to the dimuon range of @xmath27 gev/@xmath6 .",

    "accordingly , several different background subtraction methods were explored and compared .",
    "the invariant mass distribution is formed by combining muon candidate tracks of opposite charge .",
    "this unlike - sign invariant mass spectrum contains the @xmath0 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 mesons as well as both uncorrelated and correlated backgrounds .",

    "these correlated backgrounds are described in sec .",
    "the uncorrelated combinatorial background is accounted for via two methods : ( 1 ) like - sign dimuons and ( 2 ) event mixing .",
    "first , the uncorrelated combinatorial background is estimated through the like - sign background subtraction technique , which is generally associated with the assumption that the like - sign dimuon pairs come purely from combinatorial processes without any correlation between muons .",

    "muons from different events are randomly associated to produce a background distribution of uncorrelated dimuon pairs .",
    "events were mixed with partners from within the same 2%-centrality and 1-cm @xmath16-vertex bins in order to minimize the systematic uncertainties .",
    "the mixed - event background distributions ( @xmath69 ) were generated with about 8 times higher statistics than the actual background and then normalized to match the same - event foreground ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the normalization factor also accounts for slightly different multiplicities from mixing of slightly different events .",

    "the event mixing technique is used in this analysis due to the statistical limitations of the like - sign technique .",

    "dimuons from same events are less likely to be reconstructed in close proximity to each other than those in mixed events , resulting in a larger relative number of mixed - event dimuons at low mass , where the opening angle is small , than at higher mass .",
    "therefore , the normalization factor , which is simply a ratio of the like - sign same - event dimuons to like - sign mixed - event dimuons , drops at lower masses .",
