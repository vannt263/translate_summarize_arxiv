    "we can estimate a distance of a dwarf nova from the observed peak magnitude and the empirically expected absolute magnitude .",
    "the correlation between the peak magnitude ( @xmath43 ) and the orbital period ( @xmath42 ) provides @xmath44 3.85.3 for a superoutburst ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . when we apply this method to wz sge stars",
    ", however , the observed peak magnitude is not suitable to estimate a distance because they experience a rapid fading phase just after the peak , during which the viscosity decays with time ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . after this viscosity decay phase",
    ", the surface density of the accretion disk is expected to follow the same time - evolution as in superoutbursts of ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae @xcite .",
    "the peak magnitudes of these ordinary outbursts are limited by the critical surface density ( @xmath45 ) required by the disk instability theory @xcite .",
    "the calculated peak magnitudes are known to well reproduce the warner s relation .",
    "@xcite originally restricted the discussion to ss cyg - type dwarf novae , but the same discussion can be naturally extended to the upper limits of @xmath43 of normal outbursts of su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "superoutbursts are generally @xmath10.5 mag brighter than upper - limit magnitudes of normal outbursts @xcite , caused by an extra heating by tidal dissipation , a safe upper limit of @xmath43 for ordinary su uma - type superoutbursts is estimated to be 0.5 mag brighter than the extrapolation of @xcite . in the case of v592",
    "her , this value corresponds to @xmath46 , which is consistent with the reported @xmath44 3.85.3 for observed superoutbursts",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "we should hence compare the expected @xmath43 not with the observed peak magnitude , but with the magnitude at which the viscous decay finishes , in other words , an ordinary plateau phase begins .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : lc ] and a comparison with a simulation in @xcite , v592 her experienced this phase change at @xmath47 ( considering that ccd observations tended to give slightly fainter magnitudes than visual observations , and considering the difficulty in accurately estimating such a faint magnitude visually , this magnitude would better be regarded as an upper limit of the plateau phase ) .",
    "while @xcite estimate a distance @xmath48 220440 pc using a peak magnitude of @xmath49 , our estimation hence provides larger distances of @xmath50 5501100 pc .",
    "another caveat in @xcite is that they used a wrong ( longer ) superhump period based on @xcite . by adopting the correct @xmath32 = 0.05648(2 ) and",
    "estimated @xmath42 = 0.05592(3 ) d , the expected absolute magnitude of a main - sequence secondary filling the roche - lobe of this @xmath42 is at least @xmath11.0 mag fainter @xcite . based on the same method of estimate in @xcite , the lower limit of the distance from a comparison of apparent magnitude and the absolute magnitude of a main - sequence secondary is now lowered to 900 pc or even lower .",
    "this lower limit of the distance is now not at all inconsistent with an estimate from the outburst photometry .",
    "the present new determinations of the true @xmath32 , @xmath42 and the new distance estimate are thus consistent with a lower main - sequence secondary . by considering a main - sequence secondary with @xmath51 = 12.4 ( which corresponds to an upper limit of the luminosity of a main sequence filling the roche - lobe of v592 her ) , the observed color @xmath52 0.2 can be naturally explained by a contribution of this secondary star . in this case",
    ", we do nt need to assume an extremely cold ( @xmath110000 k ) white dwarf as deduced in @xcite .",
    "although accurate determination of the white dwarf temperature should await optical - uv spectroscopy , this finding seems to be consistent with recent determinations of white dwarf temperatures in wz sge - type dwarf novae ( eg cnc : 1170013000 k , hv vir : 1250014000 k @xcite ; gw lib : 14700 k in average @xcite ; ll and : 15000 k @xcite ) .",
    "the present conclusion is also comparable to recent result in wz sge itself @xcite , who concluded that a lower main - sequence secondary is still viable in spite of all the past negative efforts in directly detecting a signature of emission from the secondary of wz sge . in conjunction with the present conclusion ,",
    "the presence of a brown dwarf in wz sge - type dwarf novae is still an open question even in most promising cases .",
    ", that @xmath53 supports the brown - dwarf like nature of the secondary star .",
    "however , as discussed in subsection [ sec : esh ] , the correct @xmath42 is their @xmath41 = 0.0561(4 ) d. this value gives @xmath53 = 0.7 @xmath16 0.7% , which essentially gives no constraints on the existence of a brown dwarf .",
    "furthermore , velocity fields of emission lines in wz sge - type superoutbursts are known to be very complex @xcite , or even systematically vary @xcite .",
    "radial velocity variation of emission lines in wz sge - type superoutbursts thus may not reasonably trace the binary motion as _ a priori _ assumed in @xcite . ]      as stressed in @xcite , light curves of some wz sge - type dwarf novae often display similar characteristics to those of very fast novae .",
    "the present , first - ever fully obtained , light curve of v592 her ( figure [ fig : lc ] ) marks an even stronger similarity",
    ". in wz sge itself , either a lower surface density at the beginning of an outburst , or a self - shielding effect arising from a nearly edge - on view , may have reduced this effect . in this context , the present light curve of v592 her even ",
    "better \" reproduce the expected light curve of a wz sge - type dwarf nova @xcite . as seen in subsection [",
    "sec : esh ] , this light curve may be a result of a low binary inclination in v592 her . among the stars listed in @xcite , v358 lyr @xcite , ls and @xcite and v4338 sgr",
    "have very similar light curves to that of v592 her .",
    "these objects may comprise a group of wz sge - type dwarf novae which is either characterized by a stronger effect of initial viscous decay , or a low binary inclination .",
    "none of these systems , including v592 her @xcite , have been detected in rosat surveys ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "apparently low x - ray luminosities of these systems makes a striking difference from the relatively strong quiescent x - ray detection in wz sge @xcite .",
    "this difference from wz sge may be a result of an even smaller quiescent viscosity , which could explain a stronger effect of initial viscous decay .",
    "we observed the entire course of the 1998 outburst of v592 her , which was originally reported as a nova in 1968 .",
    "we have been able to first time construct a full light curve of the outburst , which is characterized by a rapid initial decline ( 0.98 mag d@xmath0 ) , which smoothly developed into a plateau phase with a slower linear decline .",
    "the initial rapid decay has been interpreted as a result of viscous decay theoretically and naturally expected for a high surface - density accretion disk in a wz sge - type outburst .",
    "we detected superhumps characteristic to su uma - type dwarf novae @xmath17 d after the optical maximum .",
    "the overall behavior of the light curve and the development of superhumps were characteristic to a wz sge - type dwarf nova , although there was little evidence of early superhumps , which may have been either escaped from detection because of the unfavorable observational coverage or because of a low orbital inclination .",
    "we examined astrometry of v592 her using modern material , and have yielded a safe upper limit ( yr@xmath0 ) of its proper motion .",
    "the result in @xcite would have been somehow overestimated .",
    "combined with the past literature , we have been able to uniquely determine the superhump period to be 0.05648(2 ) d. we detected a small , but significant , positive period change ( @xmath36 = + 2.1(0.8 ) @xmath34 10@xmath37 ) of superhumps .",
    "we estimated an expected orbital period of 0.05592(3 ) d. from these periods , together with the modern interpretation of the absolute magnitude of the outburst light curve , we conclude that the overall picture of v592 her is not inconsistent with a lower main - sequence secondary star in contrast to a previous claim that v592 her contains a brown dwarf .",
