    "over the last decades , the lattice boltzmann model ( lb ) has become a versatile tool in modeling complex hydrodynamic problems @xcite .",
    "recently , it has attracted considerable attention in modeling rarefied gas flows .",
    "these flows are important in several applications ranging from micro - electromechanical systems ( mems ) @xcite to aeronautical applications . with increasing rarefaction characterized by the knudsen number , the ratio of the molecular mean- free path and the macroscopic sizes , the flow experiences some interesting phenomena , such as the gaseous slip along the solid wall .",
    "the slip phenomenon is one of the cornerstone of micro - channel applications . in lb ,",
    "several methods have been proposed for the description of the slip flow , mostly based on kinetic boundary conditions @xcite , and analytical formulas have been derived for the slip velocity and the slip coefficient .",
    "we mention that the first kinetic boundary condition was introduced by lim et al . @xcite .",
    "the above approaches focused on one - component gases and the slip phenomenon in mixture lb models is yet not understood .",
    "in addition , it is worth mentioning that the bare diffuse reflection boundary condition can not reproduce the correct value of the slip coefficient @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present a boundary layer theory for binary lattice boltzmann models and introduce a new boundary treatment in order to get tunable slip coefficient in the method .",
    "we consider both single and multicomponent bgk - type collision operators as well . in the framework of the boundary layer theory , analytical formula",
    "is derived for the slip coefficient .",
    "simulations are performed to validate the model .",
    "the analytical results are in excellent agreement with the ones obtained from the numerical simulations .",
    "we begin our consideration with the binary discrete boltzmann equation for single- and multi - fluid bgk - type collision operators @xmath0+\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\nu_m[f^{\\sigma ( e)}(\\rho_\\sigma,\\bm{u})-f_i^{\\sigma ( e)}(\\rho_\\sigma,\\bm{u}_\\sigma ) ] , % \\label{1b } % \\partial_t g_i(\\bm{x},t ) + c_{2ia } \\partial_a g_i(\\bm{x},t)=\\nonumber\\\\ % ( \\nu_1+\\nu_m ) [ f^e_i(\\rho_2,\\bm{u}_2)-g_i]+\\nu_m[g^e_i(\\rho_2,\\bm{u})-g_i^e(\\rho_2,\\bm{u}_2)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 denote the single - specie distribution function and equilibrium distribution function , @xmath2 are the discrete speed vectors and @xmath3 are the collision frequencies related to the transport coefficients .",

    "the velocity vectors are rescaled with the @xmath16 multiplier .",
    "this is a convenient choice for our purposes and our calculations .",
    "the definition of the model is given by the above equations , eq .",
    "( [ 4a],[4b ] ) . to complete our definition",
    ", we mention that the non - dimensional sound speed of the model is unity .",
    "the specie sound speed is given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the averaged mass and @xmath19 is the mixture sound speed . before going to the boundary layer theory ,",
    "some comments are in order . the collision operator in the governing equation , eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , is equivalent with the so - called hamel model @xcite , which describes coupled relaxation towards the local specie and mixture equilibriums @xcite . with the choice of @xmath20 , the collision model results in the single - fluid bgk model .",
    "in the two - fluid model , the mixture viscosity is given by @xmath21 and the diffusivity takes the value of @xmath22 .",
    "we turn our attention to the half space problem experienced by a gas flow along a solid wall .",
    "this is the so - called kramers problem in kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "the solid wall lies in the @xmath23 direction and is located at @xmath24 . in the @xmath25 region ,",
    "the gas medium exhibits a shear flow . under these circumstances",
    ", we are looking for the macroscopic velocity obtained from eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) . this problem can be simplified by introducing a new reduced distribution function instead of @xmath26 @xmath27,\\nonumber\\\\ f_0^\\sigma&=&m_\\sigma c_\\sigma \\sqrt{3 } [ f^\\sigma_2-f^\\sigma_4],\\nonumber\\\\ f_2^\\sigma&=&m_\\sigma c_\\sigma \\sqrt{3 } [ f^\\sigma_5-f^\\sigma_8].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we also introduce the following weights , @xmath28 , and one - dimensional velocity vectors , @xmath29 , corresponding to the new distribution function in such a way that @xmath30 with using the reduced distribution function , the macroscopic specie velocity is obtained by @xmath31 .",
    "the reduced distribution function obeys the following governing equation obtained from eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) in the steady state @xmath32 this equation is the boundary layer equation , which needs to be solved for the macroscopic velocity . the solution of this differential equation is obtained in the form @xmath33 . as a consequence ,",
    "we obtain the following generalized eigenvalue problem @xmath34 this equation is written out in components in the appendix , eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of the problem are obtained by @xmath35 $ ] , where @xmath36 is listed in the appendix , eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "the two zero eigenvalues correspond to a linear flow profile , while the other two to a growing and a decaying exponential solution .",
    "we remind that in the single component d2q9 models the non - zero eigenvalues are absent .",
    "however , these two solutions in the mixture case describe the knudsen layer function fading away in order of the mean free path far from the wall .",
    "the linear flow profile corresponds to the hydrodynamic shear flow in the bulk region .",
    "after some straightforward algebra , one can obtain the linear solution from eq .",
    "( [ 8a ] ) as @xmath37 where the @xmath38 superscript denotes the hydrodynamic part of the distribution function and the velocity .",
    "the general solution of the boundary layer equation , eq . ( [ 8a ] ) , is given by the linear combination of the hydrodynamic shear solution , @xmath39 , and a knudsen layer part corresponding to the nonzero eigenvalues .",
    "here , we mention that in our work , the knudsen layer concept is identical with the boundary layer provided by the established model and obtained from the analytical derivation .",
    "this is because the lb model is a special discrete ordinate method for the solution of the boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "as it has been recently shown , knudsen layer appears in discrete kinetic models once the reflected populations have different @xmath40 normal components @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the boundary layer appearing in the model is physically relevant .",
    "however , in order to obtain quantitatively correct information , one needs to apply optimized boundary condition presented below .    before determining the slip coefficient in the model",
    ", we theoretically show that the shear stress is independent of the knudsen layer part .",
    "indeed , the shear stress obtained from the knudsen layer solution is given by @xmath41 .",
    "it is quickly realized that @xmath42 is always zero for @xmath43 , because @xmath44 is nothing just the sum of the left hand side of all equations of eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) , which is identically zero because the right hand side becomes the collision invariant of the momenta for the overall mixture .",
    "this is an important property of the half space problem and remains valid for other velocity models as well . as a result , the shear stress at the wall can be obtained from the hydrodynamic solution , eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) , by @xmath45 in this way , the velocity gradient is always available from the shear stress independently of the unknown knudsen layer function .",
    "in rarefied gas flows , the slip velocity , @xmath46 , is considered as the _ extrapolated _ gas velocity at the wall without the knudsen layer .",
    "it is given in the following form @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the slip coefficient , the viscosity , the mixture reference speed and the pressure , respectively . in the present model , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) , @xmath51 is the so - called viscosity based slip coefficient @xcite , which is a useful definition , since it connects the slip coefficient to a transport coefficient , which is always available independently of the molecular details of the rarefied gas . in order to get the slip coefficient",
    ", we need to determine the magnitude of the hydrodynamic solution in the boundary layer .",
    "this is fixed by the used boundary condition at the wall .",
    "we introduce a modified diffuse boundary condition in the model in order to get variable slip coefficient .",
    "the boundary treatment for the reflected populations , @xmath52 , are written by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a yet unknown parameter , which will be determined below .",
    "for the quantity , @xmath55 , the above boundary condition is written by @xmath56 the particular solution of eq .",
    "( [ 8a ] ) is given by the linear combination of the decaying exponential solution and the hydrodynamic part .",
    "the magnitude of hydrodynamic solution and the knudsen layer part is determined by the boundary condition , eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) , in such a way that @xmath57 these equations need to be solved for the unknown quantities , @xmath58 .",
    "it is realized that for obtaining the slip velocity , we need the ratio @xmath59 corresponding to the decaying eigenvalue @xmath60",
    ". this can be obtained from eq .",

    "the space derivatives are computed using the modified runge - kutta and midpoint method , respectively @xcite .",
    "note that this scheme is _ second order _ accurate in both time and space @xcite .",
    "the kramers problem is simulated in an @xmath68 domain , @xmath69 .",
    "the left hand side wall is at rest , while the right hand the side moves with a constant velocity to maintain the constant shear flow in the domain .",

    "the proposed model can be used to tune the value of the slip coefficient . note that above boundary condition can be used in non - stationary case as well .    before concluding our work",
