    "the kinematical approach to describe the status of universe is interesting for its distinguished feature that it does not rely on any dynamical gravity theory and dark energy models .",
    "then it becomes crucial for its potential ability to distinguish cosmological models when a flood of dark energy models and modified gravity theories are proposed to explain the current accelerated expansion of our universe .",
    "this late time accelerated expansion of our universe was firstly revealed by two teams observation of type ia supernovae @xcite . in general , via the taylor expansion of the scale factor @xmath9 in terms of cosmic time @xmath10 , the dimensionless coefficients @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 named deceleration , jerk and snap parameters are defined respectively , for the detailed forms please see eq .",
    "( [ eq : q_0 ] , [ eq : j_0 ] , [ eq : s_0 ] ) in the following . for convenience ,",
    "they are dubbed as _",
    "cosmographic parameters_. these cosmographic parameters , which current values can be determined by cosmic observations , describe the kinematical status of our universe . for example",
    ", the present value of hubble parameter @xmath11 describes the present expansion rate of our universe , and a negative value of @xmath0 means that our universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion .",
    "this kind of approach is also called cosmography @xcite , cosmokinetics @xcite , or friedmannless cosmology @xcite . recently ,",
    "this approach was considered by using sn in ref .",
    "@xcite , sn+grbs in ref .",
    "@xcite and sn+ohd+bao in @xcite , where the current status of our universe can be read . on the other hand , for a concrete dark energy model or gravity theory , when the friedmann equation is arrived the corresponding cosmographic parameters can be derived by simple calculation . as a consequence",
    ", the corresponding parameter spaces can be fixed from cosmographic parameters space without implementing annoying data fitting procedure .",
    "however , the reliability of the cosmographic approach depends crucially on how the cosmographic parameter space is shrunk , in other words , the improvement of the figure of merit ( fom ) . that is the main motivation of this paper . in general , when more cosmic observational data sets are added to constrain model parameter space , the more degeneracies between model parameters will be broken .",
    "also the fom will be improved .",
    "so , to investigate the current status of our universe and to improve the fom , the cosmographic parameters will be determined by more cosmic observations . when the sn and grbs are used as distance indicators , the hubble parameter @xmath11 and",
    "the absolute magnitudes of sn and grbs are treated as notorious parameters and marginalized . that is to say , sn and grbs can not fix the current value of hubble parameter @xmath11 .",
    "that is what the authors have done in ref .",
    "@xcite where the cosmographic parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 were investigated .",
    "however , the cosmographic parameters permeate in a relative larger space .",
    "of course , to describe the kinematical status of our universe well , one has to shrink the parameter space efficiently .",
    "fortunately , when the hubble parameter @xmath11 is fixed as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , the parameter space is pinned down effectively",
    ". when the snap parameter @xmath2 is included , high redshift observations should be added .",
    "so , in this paper we are going to use sn , bao , grbs , ohd to investigate the cosmographic approach .",
    "when sn data sets are used , the systematic errors are included .",
    "the bao are detected in the clustering of the combined 2dfgrs and sdss main galaxy samples , so it is helpful to break the degeneracies between parameters .",
    "the ohd data sets are used to fix the hubble parameter @xmath11 .",
    "higher redshift data ponits are from grbs where the correlation parameters are calibrated via cosmographic approach synchronously . for the detailed description of these data sets",
    ", please see the appendix [ app : obervations ] .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : cg ] , the definition of cosmographic parameters and basic expansions with respect to redshift @xmath12 are presented , where to consider the convergence issue , the map from @xmath13 to @xmath14 is adopted . to the expansion truncation problem",
    ", we compare the expansions with @xmath8cdm model in the range of redshift involved in this paper .",
    "the relative departure of hubble parameter from that of @xmath8cdm model is up to @xmath15 at the redshift @xmath16 .",
    "the dfference of distance modulus between the expansion of luminosity distance and that of @xmath8cdm model is less than @xmath17 .",

    "to obtain these results , the cosmic observational data sets from sn ia , bao , ohd and grbs and mcmc method are used .",

    "bao and ohd are used to shrink the model parameter space .",
    "the calibration of grbs and constraint to cosmographic parameters are carried out synchronously . in this way the so - called circular problem is removed .",

    ", we only consider the spatially flat case @xmath20 .",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath21 can be expanded as @xmath22 where the subscript @xmath23 denotes the value at the present epoch and @xmath24 . via the relation @xmath25 one has @xmath26\\right|_0\\nonumber\\\\ & = & ( 6 + 12q_0 + 3q_0 ^ 2 + 4j_0-s_0)h_0 - 3(2 + 3q_0+j_0)(2+q_0)h_0\\nonumber\\\\ & + & ( 1+q_0)\\left[2 + 2(1+q_0)+2(1+q_0)^2+q_0 ^ 2-j_0\\right]h_0\\nonumber\\\\ & = & [ 3q_0 ^ 3 + 3q_0",

    "when the convergence problem is solved , one has to concern the expansion truncation issue . of course , with higher orders expansion , more accurate approximation would be obtained . however , in this way , one has to introduce more model parameters beyond @xmath11 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . how to keep the balance between the free model parameters ( or expansion truncation ) and comic observational data points",
    "is another complicated problem . that is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "but we d like to point out that the way out may be the so - call bayesian evidence method .",
    "in fact , we can show the deviations of the expansions from @xmath8cdm model . for illustration , with fixed value of @xmath36 , the relative departure of hubble parameter from @xmath8cdm model ( the left panel ) and differences of distance modulus to @xmath8cdm model ( the right panel ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : deviations ] .",
    "actually , in the redshift range ( @xmath37 $ ] , please see tab .",
    "[ hubbledata ] ) of the observational hubble parameters , the relative departure of @xmath8cdm model is up to @xmath38 which is almost the same of order of error bars of ohd .",

    "the departure is larger up to @xmath40 . in the redshift range of this paper ,",
    "@xmath41 $ ] , the difference of distance modulus is less than @xmath17 .",
    "so , up to the fourth oder of @xmath42 , these expansions are safe .",
    "cdm model , where @xmath36 is fixed.,title=\"fig:\",width=309 ] cdm model , where @xmath36 is fixed.,title=\"fig:\",width=306 ]    as the reader has noticed the taylor expansion is up to snap parameter @xmath2 , with these cosmographic parameters the hubble parameter is of the order @xmath43 .",
    "however , @xmath44 and @xmath31 are of the order @xmath45 .",
    "this is really from the fact that the hubble parameter has contained one order derivative of time @xmath10 .",
    "when it is up to the same order of @xmath44 and @xmath31 , an extra new parameter has to be introduced .",
    "so we will classify the data sets on hand into two cases with ( case i : sn+bao+grbs ) or without ( case ii : sn+bao+grbs+ohd ) the observational hubble data .",
    "another reason is that the cosmic observational data sets of sn and grbs do not have constraint to hubble parameter @xmath11 .",
    "that can be seen clearly from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cases ] in this paper .",
    "so , to fix the current value of hubble parameter , the ohd data sets should be added .",
    "the reader can also see that the bao data set is helpful to shrink the parameter space .",
    "in our calculations , we have taken the total likelihood function @xmath46 to be the products of the separate likelihoods of sn ( with systematic errors ) , bao , grbs and ohd",
    ". then we get @xmath47 @xmath48 where the separate likelihoods of sn , bao , grbs , ohd and the current observational data sets used in this paper are shown in the appendix [ app : obervations ] .    in our analysis",
