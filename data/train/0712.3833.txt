    "over the past three decades or more astronomical evidence has been interpreted by some as suggesting that a major component of the redshift of quasars arises from a non - cosmological origin @xcite , which is quantized in some fashion .",
    "they offered schemes of quantization of the redshift , @xmath0 , either linear in @xmath0 or as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "it has also been suggested that the intrinsic component of redshift is some harmonic of a preferred value . amongst the earliest reports @xcite found that @xmath3 occurred frequently suggesting something intrinsic .",
    "@xcite also suggested a quantization scheme of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an integer .",
    "then more recently @xcite suggested that all quasar redshifts contain some harmonic of @xmath6 .",
    "recently @xcite analyzed the data from the third data release of the the sloan digital sky survey @xcite and found a significant peak in the power spectrum near @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 represents the periodic interval seen in quasar redshift abundances . in this paper",
    "i analyze the sdss sixth quasar data release using a fourier transform of their redshift abundances as a function of redshift .",
    "i show , regardless of any interpretation of the meaning of the redshifts , and aside from any cosmological assumptions , that there is a significant periodicity in the sdss quasar redshift abundance data . but also the same periods are seen in the mean of the parameter @xmath1 supplied by the sloan survey people to flag reliability of the redshift .",
    "moreover if one filters the data by the @xmath1 parameter the peaks in the fourier spectrum are enhanced .",
    "this proves that , whatever their cause , they are fundamentally connected to the algorithm that assigned the @xmath1 parameter and not to some intrinsic effect from the quasars .",
    "i obtained 80,398 quasar data from the sdss bestdr6 database @xcite available at @xmath10 .",
    "the data were selected by @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 for @xmath14 , low redshift and high redshift quasars , respectively .",
    "these include any objects with spectra that have been classified by the spectroscopic pipeline as quasars ( @xmath15 or @xmath14 ) .",
    "the dr6 data used here were not filtered as was the dr5 quasar catalog , described in schneider et al .",
    "@xcite . in that case",
    "the dr5 catalog quasars were chosen from those that have apparent i - band psf magnitudes fainter than 15 , absolute i - band magnitudes brighter than -22 , contain at least one emission line or are unambiguously broad absorption line quasars , and have highly reliable redshifts . in the latter cosmological assumptions",
    "were required to obtain absolute magnitudes . for this analysis",
    "such assumptions were avoided .",
    "however to exclude low redshift misidentification , and noise from insufficient high redshift data , i used only data where @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath9 relation was calculated by binning the number of quasars with redshifts that fall between @xmath0 and @xmath17 .",
    "the resulting @xmath9 plot is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "quasars are identified optically and their redshifts determined from their bright emission lines .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 was assigned as figure of merit of the confidence on the redshift .",
    "it is plotted here as a function of redshift , @xmath0 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .    a possible correlation between the under abundances , or valleys in the @xmath9 function , at certain redshifts has been studied by @xcite .",
    "they found little likelihood of any selection effect on the data they used ( dr3 in their case ) .",
    "see their fig .",
    "11 and the discussion thereabout .",
    "the valleys in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] are found in the same redshift regions and the abundances shown generally agree with the 6 peaks observed by @xcite .",
    "the discrete fourier transforms were calculated with mathematica software from the @xmath9 relation determined by binning @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) and from the mean value of @xmath1 binned with @xmath18 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) . for the fourier spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] the quasar redshift , @xmath0 , data were binned with @xmath19 .",
    "the peaks are labeled 1 through 5 .    within the @xmath20th bin",
    "there are @xmath21 samples .",
    "discrete fourier amplitudes @xmath22 are generated for each integer @xmath23 from @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath5 is the total number of @xmath21 bins . because @xmath22 are complex their absolute value is taken in the analysis .",
    "the fourier frequencies are calculated from @xmath27 where @xmath8 is the redshift interval of any periodic structure in redshift space . in order to more easily identify the redshift interval in the power spectra used here",
    "i have converted the fourier frequency axis to units of @xmath8 .    the power spectrum from @xmath9",
    "was then fitted with the sum of 5 gaussian curves , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] as the solid ( red ) curve .",
    "the resulting best fit peak @xmath8 values and their standard deviations are listed in table i. from this figure it is apparent that the peaks are significant to about 3@xmath28 when compared to the higher fourier frequency noise . in order to obtain the best fits",
    "i first fitted a power law to the data of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] while ignoring the peaks .",
    "this is shown by the dot - dashed ( blue ) line , which was subsequently used with the gaussian fit .",
    "the fit to peak number 1 is very dependent on the power law fit , so its peak value has the largest uncertainty .",
    "peak number 2 is the same as that found by @xcite .",
    "table i : redshift @xmath8 intervals +    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the mean of the @xmath1 parameter binned with @xmath18 is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : fig4 ] .",
    "the fourier transform of this data was then taken and the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , compared with the fourier spectrum of the @xmath9 data of the quasar redshifts drawn from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] but with the power law dependence ( dot - dashed ( blue ) curve ) removed .",
    "the numbered peaks correspond to the same peaks of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "it is quite obvious from fig . [",
    "fig : fig5 ] that the periodic structure of the mean of the @xmath1 parameter in redshift space corresponds exactly with the periodic structure of the redshift abundances themselves , indicated by the coincidence of the peaks in their fourier power spectra .",
    "therefore this suggests that the origin of any periodic redshift dependence in the quasars is an artifact of the sampling algorithm .",
    "this argument is further strengthened when we look at the fourier spectra of the @xmath9 function where the redshift data have been filtered by the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] . as cuts in the data of higher and higher values of @xmath1",
    "are taken stronger fourier peaks emerge .",
    "this indicates also a strong correlation between the two .",
    "it is worth noting that the indicated peaks , corresponding to the redshift periods @xmath8 of table i , can be approximated by @xmath29 where the integer @xmath30 and @xmath31 , within the standard errors of their gaussian fits .",
    "one could speculate that this implies an intrinsic redshift @xcite , quantized in some fashion , but this analysis seems to indicate otherwise .",
    "fourier spectral analysis has been carried out on the abundance of quasar redshifts as a function of redshift from the sdss dr6 data release .",
    "the analysis finds that there are preferred redshifts separated by intervals of @xmath320.258 , 0.312 , 0.44 , 0.63 , and 1.1 , which could all be harmonics of some more fundamental value @xmath33 .",
    "however there is also a strong correlation with the @xmath1 parameter used to flag the quality of the @xmath0 parameter itself .",
    "regardless of the algorithm used to determine @xmath1 , this fact then strongly brings into doubt any validity to the argument that these periodic redshifts indicate preferred intrinsic redshifts for the quasars in the sloan survey .",
    "most probably an as - yet - undetermined selection effect simulates these periodic preferred redshifts .",
