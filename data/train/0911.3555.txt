    "with the new observational techniques of the next generation surveys , like pan - starrs and lsst , the number of moving objects detected in each night of observations is expected to increase by two orders of magnitude with respect to the current surveys . to deal with this huge amount of data",
    "the interest in the study of orbit determination methods has been renewed , both from the theoretical and the computational point of view .",
    "the classical methods of preliminary orbit determination by laplace  @xcite and gauss  @xcite , that have been often revisited in the last two centuries @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , are based on the knowledge of at least three observations of a solar system body in three different nights .",
    "both laplace s and gauss method may produce more than one preliminary orbit for the same object : a detailed analysis of the occurrence of multiple solutions is in @xcite .",
    "the determination of a preliminary orbit is followed by the _ differential corrections _",
    "@xcite , an iterative method to obtain the minimum of a target function , that improves the orbit in the sense of the least squares fit of the residuals : this sequence of operations was already proposed in @xcite .",
    "the data of the current surveys generally do not provide a single observation for an object in an observing night : in fact the moving objects are distinguished from fixed stars by detecting them a few times in the same night : the sequence of observations usually gives a _ too short arc _ on the celestial sphere @xcite , such that the data are not enough to compute an orbit for that body . as the number of detected objects per night is very large , it is difficult to decide whether two sequences of observations made in different nights belong to the same object : this gives rise to the problem of _ linkage _ of two short arcs of observations .",
    "the information contained in a short arc of observations can be used to define an _ attributable _",
    "@xcite , consisting of the angular position and velocity of the body on the celestial sphere at a given time ; the topocentric distance and the radial velocity at that time are unknown",
    ". therefore two short arcs of observations belonging to the same object provide us with 8 scalar data , from which we can try to compute an orbit .    in 1977",
    "taff and hall proposed to use the angular momentum and the energy integrals to perform orbit determination starting from a data set that corresponds to two attributables of the same observed body ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "they noticed that the problem can be written in an algebraic form but , since the total degree is high , they suggested to use a newton - raphson method to solve the problem .",
    "this approach deals with the solutions only locally , and there are alternative possible solutions that can be lost . in this paper",
    "we shall start from the same first integrals of the kepler problem , but we shall exploit the algebraic character of the problem , keeping in this way a global control on the solutions .",
    "in particular we shall present two different methods to solve by elimination the polynomial system corresponding to this problem , and to compute all the related preliminary orbits defined by the two attributables .",
    "since an orbit is defined by 6 scalar data , the available information is redundant , and we can use this to set compatibility conditions for the solutions ( see ( [ compatible ] ) ) , that should be fulfilled if the two attributables belong to the same solar system object .",
    "the unavoidable errors in the observations affect also the computation of the attributables . given a covariance matrix for the two attributables , expressing their uncertainty , we can use this to compute the value of an _ identification norm _",
    ", based on the compatibility conditions , to decide if the attributables may be related to the same body ( i.e. if the linkage is successful ) and to choose among possible alternative solutions .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : after introducing some notation related to attributables in section  [ s : attrib ] , we explain in section  [ s : linkage ] the orbit determination method and derive the bivariate polynomial system whose roots give us the topocentric distances of the observed object at the two epochs . in section  [ s : algor ]",
    "we explain the two algorithms that we propose to search for these roots and the effective computation of the orbits . in section  [ s : uncert ]",
    "we deal with the uncertainty of the data , introduce the identification norm and provide the covariance matrices of the preliminary orbits .",
    "some numerical experiments are presented in the last two sections : in section  [ s : example ] we show the results of a test case , illustrating the computation of the preliminary orbits for a numbered asteroid whose orbit is well known , while in section  [ s : simul ] we investigate the performance of the method for a large database of simulated observations .",
    "let @xmath0 be spherical coordinates for the topocentric position of a solar system body .",
    "the angular coordinates @xmath1 are defined by a topocentric coordinate system that can be arbitrarily selected .",
    "usually , in the applications , @xmath2 is the right ascension and @xmath3 the declination with respect to an equatorial coordinate system ( e.g. , j2000 ) .    given a short arc of observations of a celestial body @xmath4 , for @xmath5 with @xmath6 , it is often possible to compute an attributable , that is a vector @xmath7 representing the angular position and velocity of the body at a mean time @xmath8 in the selected coordinates ( see @xcite ) .",
    "usually we choose @xmath8 as the mean @xmath9 .",
    "the attributable is computed by a polynomial fit , typically linear or quadratic , and the observations used in the computation need to be made by the same observatory .",
    "if the observations are enough , i.e. @xmath6 for a linear fit , @xmath10 for a quadratic one , then we can compute also a covariance matrix @xmath11 , representing the uncertainty of the attributable .",
    "note that the topocentric distances @xmath12 at times @xmath13 are completely unknown .",
    "we introduce the heliocentric position and velocity of the body at time @xmath14 @xmath15 with @xmath16 , @xmath17 the topocentric distance and the radial velocity , and with @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 the observation direction and its partial derivatives with respect to @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    the vectors @xmath21 represent the heliocentric position and velocity of the observer on the earth . the observer position is know as a function of time , but for consistency , if the attributable is computed by a fit to polynomials with low degree , the values @xmath22 need to be computed by the same interpolation .",
    "therefore we make a quadratic fit with the actual geocentric positions @xmath23 at the times of the individual observations ( @xmath24 is the heliocentric position of the earth center ) to obtain the interpolating function @xmath25 ; then we take @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this method was suggested by poincar in @xcite , and it is important to obtain preliminary orbits of better quality , see @xcite .",
    "in rectangular coordinates we have @xmath28 these vectors form an orthogonal system , in particular @xmath29 where the dot indicates the euclidean scalar product and @xmath30 the corresponding norm .    for later reference",
    "we introduce the orthonormal basis @xmath31 adapted to the apparent path @xmath32 of the observed body on the celestial sphere : we define the unit vector @xmath33 by the relation @xmath34 where @xmath35 and is called _",
    "proper motion_. moreover we set @xmath36 .",
    "given two attributables @xmath37 at different epochs @xmath38 , in the hypothesis that they belong to the same observed body , we write down polynomial equations for the topocentric distance and radial velocity of the body at the two epochs by using the angular momentum and the energy integrals .      for a given attributable @xmath39 the angular momentum vector ( per unit mass )",
    "can be written as a polynomial function of the radial distance and velocity @xmath40 : @xmath41 where @xmath42 depend only on the attributable @xmath39 and on the motion of the observer @xmath21 at the time @xmath8 of the attributable .",
    "for the given @xmath39 we can also write the two - body energy as a function of @xmath40 , as in @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is gauss constant and @xmath45 depend only on @xmath46 .",
    "now we take two attributables @xmath47 , @xmath48 at epochs @xmath49 ; we shall use the notation of section  [ ss : am_energy ] , with index @xmath50 or @xmath51 referring to the epoch .",
    "if @xmath52 , @xmath53 correspond to the same physical object , then the angular momentum vectors at the two epochs must coincide : @xmath54 where @xmath55 relation ( [ eq_am ] ) is a system of three equations in the four unknowns @xmath56 , with constraints @xmath57 by scalar multiplication of ( [ eq_am ] ) with @xmath58 we eliminate the variables @xmath59 and obtain the equation @xmath60    the left hand side in ( [ eq_am_scal ] ) is a quadratic form in the variables @xmath61 ; we write it as @xmath62 with @xmath63 @xmath64 equation ( [ quad_form ] ) defines a conic section in the @xmath65 plane , with symmetry axes parallel to the coordinate axes .",
    "since the directions of @xmath66 correspond to @xmath67 , for @xmath68 small enough the angle between these two directions is small and the coefficients @xmath69 have opposite signs , thus in this case ( [ quad_form ] ) defines a hyperbola .",
    "we can compute the radial velocities @xmath59 by vector multiplication of ( [ eq_am ] ) with @xmath70 and @xmath71 , projecting on the direction of @xmath58 : @xmath72    for the given @xmath37 we can also equate the corresponding two - body energies @xmath73 .",
    "we use the expressions of @xmath74 above and substitute them into @xmath75 , thus we obtain @xmath76 for some polynomial functions @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 with degrees @xmath81 and @xmath82 . by",
    "squaring we have @xmath83 squaring again we obtain the polynomial equation @xmath84 ^ 2 - 64k^8{\\cal g}_1{\\cal g}_2 = 0 \\ , , \\label{eq_energies}\\ ] ] with total degree 24 .",
    "some spurious solutions may have been added as a result of squaring expressions with unknown sign .",
    "note that , if the observations were made from the center of the earth , @xmath85 would be the angular momentum of the earth at epochs @xmath86 , @xmath87 , thus @xmath88 and @xmath89 . with this simplifying assumption",
    "@xmath90 is a solution of the system @xmath91 that corresponds to the earth center and therefore is not acceptable .",
    "this solution also appears in the geocentric version of the method of laplace for a preliminary orbit from 3 observations .",
    "actually we use topocentric observations , for which the zero solution is replaced by one with both @xmath92 and @xmath93 very small .",
    "the quadratic form ( [ quad_form ] ) degenerates into a linear function when @xmath94 a simple computation shows that @xmath95 thus , assuming that the proper motions @xmath96 , @xmath97 do not vanish and setting @xmath98 , the degeneration occurs when either @xmath99 vanishes ( c0 ) or at least one the following relations holds : @xmath100 the interpretation of these conditions is the following : ( c0 ) means that @xmath101 point to either exactly the same or exactly the opposite direction in the sky ; ( c1 ) means that both sets @xmath102 and @xmath103 are constituted of coplanar vectors ; ( c2 ) says that @xmath104 are coplanar .",
    "let us discuss condition ( c3 ) : @xmath105 means that @xmath106 are coplanar and @xmath107 means that @xmath108 are coplanar as well .",
    "if @xmath109 we obtain that the four vectors @xmath110 all lie in the same plane . in particular",
    "( c3 ) implies that @xmath111 belongs to the great circle defined by the intersection of the plane generated by @xmath112 with the celestial sphere .",
    "this degeneration condition can be compared with the failure condition of the classical orbit determination methods with three observations by gauss and laplace  @xcite , due to vanishing of the curvature in the apparent path of the observed body on the celestial sphere .",
    "the discussion of condition ( c4 ) is similar to the previous one and corresponds to the coplanarity of @xmath113 .",
    "in this section we introduce two different methods to search for the solutions of the semi - algebraic problem @xmath114 for the polynomials @xmath115 introduced in ( [ eq_energies ] ) , ( [ quad_form ] ) respectively .",
    "moreover we explain the full procedure for the computation of the preliminary orbits and introduce compatibility conditions to decide whether the attributables used to define the problem are related to the same solar system body .",
    "the first method consists in writing the resultant ( see @xcite ) of @xmath116 and @xmath117 with respect to one variable , say @xmath92 . in this way we find a univariate polynomial in the @xmath93 variable whose real positive roots are the only possible @xmath93-components of a solution of ( [ intersec ] ) . by grouping the monomials with the same power of @xmath92 we can write @xmath118 @xmath119 and @xmath120 for some univariate polynomial coefficients @xmath121 depending on @xmath93 ( actually @xmath122 are constant ) .",
    "we consider the resultant @xmath123 of @xmath124 with respect to @xmath92 : it is generically a degree 48 polynomial defined as the determinant of the sylvester matrix @xmath125 the positive real roots of @xmath123 are the only possible values of @xmath93 for a solution @xmath126 of ( [ intersec ] ) .",
    "we could use the resultant method to eliminate the variable @xmath93 by a different grouping of the terms of @xmath124 : @xmath127 where the degrees of @xmath128 are described by the same rules as for @xmath129 .",
    "apart from non - real and non - positive solutions , we shall see that there are additional different reasons to discard some pairs of solutions of ( [ intersec ] ) , thus we expect that the number of acceptable ones is not large .",
    "we use a scheme similar to @xcite to compute the coefficients of the resultant @xmath123 :    * evaluate @xmath130 at the 64-th roots of unit @xmath131 , by a dft ( discrete fourier transform ) algorithm ; * compute the determinant of the 64 sylvester matrices ; by relation @xmath132 we have the values of @xmath123 at the 64-th roots of unit ; * apply an idft ( inverse discrete fourier transform ) algorithm to obtain the coefficients of @xmath123 from its evaluations .",
    "the use of the dft and idft allows us to interpolate the resultant @xmath123 in an efficient way .",
    "the use of numerical evaluations , e.g. at the roots of unit , avoids the difficulty of writing a very long symbolic expression for the resultant , that could be cumbersome to be managed by a programming language compiler .",
    "the complete set of complex roots of @xmath123 , with an error bound for each of them , are computed using the algorithm described in @xcite , which is based on simultaneous iterations .",
    "let @xmath133 , @xmath134 , be the subset of the real and positive roots of @xmath123 .",
    "then for each @xmath44 we perform the sequence of operations below :    * solve the equation @xmath135 and compute the two possible values @xmath136 , @xmath137 for @xmath92 , discarding negative solutions . then define @xmath138 equal to either @xmath136 or @xmath137 , selecting the one that gives the smaller value of @xmath139 ; * discard spurious solutions , resulting from the squaring used to reduce the energy equality to the polynomial equation ( [ eq_energies ] ) .",
    "the spurious solutions are the solutions of ( [ intersec ] ) that do not satisfy either ( [ energyeq_fstsquare ] ) or ( [ energyeq_nosquare ] ) ; * compute the corresponding values of @xmath140 by ( [ rhojdot ] ) and obtain a pair of orbits defined by the sets @xmath141 of _ attributable elements _ , for @xmath142 ; * change from attributable elements to cartesian heliocentric coordinates by relation @xmath143 for @xmath142 , and by the corresponding formula for @xmath144 . note that the observer position @xmath145 is not the actual @xmath146 , but is obtained by interpolation as proposed by poincar ( see section  [ s : attrib ] ) .",
    "then a standard coordinate change allows us to obtain the related pairs of orbital elements : we shall use keplerian elements @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the mean anomaly where @xmath149 is the perihelion distance and @xmath150 the time of perihelion passage : this set would allow to handle also parabolic and hyperbolic orbits . ] .",
    "the epochs of the orbits are @xmath151 , corrected by aberration due to the finite velocity of the light @xmath152 : @xmath153 for @xmath142 .",
    "we have implemented this algorithm in fortran 90 using _",
    "quadruple precision _ for part of these computations , in particular the ones related to dft and idft .",
    "this feature appeared necessary to obtain reliable results starting from our first numerical experiments .",
    "another method to compute the solutions of ( [ intersec ] ) is based on a coordinate change to variables @xmath154 , that allows to perform easily the elimination of either @xmath155 or @xmath156 .",
    "let us set @xmath157 first we consider the affine transformation to intermediate variables @xmath158 @xmath159 where , to eliminate the linear terms in ( [ quad_form ] ) , we set @xmath160 so that @xmath161\\,,\\hskip 0.6 cm % \\ ] ]  = q_0,0 - -  .",
    "if we set , for an arbitrary @xmath162 , @xmath163 we obtain @xmath164\\ , , % \\hskip 1 cm % \\mbox{with } \\",
    "\\cstar = -\\frac{\\kappa}{2\\ ; q_{2,0 } \\sigma_1 ^ 2}\\ .\\ ] ] we already observed that , for @xmath68 small enough , @xmath165 and @xmath166 have opposite signs , hence in this case the variable change @xmath167 is real .",
    "however , in general , we have to consider @xmath167 as a transformation of the complex domain @xmath168 .",
    "we also have @xmath169 where @xmath170 and @xmath171 depend only on the coefficients of @xmath172 .",
    "now we apply a rotation of angle @xmath173 to pass to the @xmath154 variables : @xmath174 \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } \\zeta_1\\cr \\zeta_2\\cr \\end{array } \\right)\\ .\\ ] ] we have @xmath175\\,,\\\\ % p\\circ{\\cal t}^{-1}\\circ{\\cal r}^{-1 } ( \\xi_1,\\xi_2 ) & = & \\sum_{i , j=0}^{24 } p^\\star_{i , j } \\xi_1^i \\xi_2^j\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath176 and @xmath177 the last equality is obtained taking into account that @xmath178 . using the relation @xmath179 we can consider in place of @xmath180 the polynomial @xmath181 with @xmath182 @xmath183 @xmath184    we consider the algebraic problem in normal form @xmath185 in this case we have to consider all the solutions of ( [ normal_form ] ) , not only the ones with real and positive components .    if @xmath186 , then the solutions @xmath187 of ( [ normal_form ] ) are of the form @xmath188 or @xmath189 , where @xmath190 , @xmath191 are the roots of @xmath192 and @xmath193 respectively .",
    "if @xmath194 , using the relation @xmath179 we can eliminate one variable , say @xmath155 , from @xmath195 .",
    "thus we obtain the univariate polynomial @xmath196 we compute all the complex roots @xmath197 of @xmath198 by the algorithm in @xcite ; then for each @xmath44 we define the other component of the solution by @xmath199 given all the complex solutions of ( [ normal_form ] ) we compute the corresponding points in the @xmath126 plane by @xmath200 discarding the ones with non - real or non - positive components . at this point",
    "the preliminary orbits can be computed following the same steps 5 ) , 6 ) , 7 ) of the algorithm explained in subsection  [ ss : dft ] .    from a few experiments",
    "performed this method seems to require more than quadruple precision because of the complicated formulae defining the transformation used to obtain the normal form ( [ normal_form ] ) .",
    "thus the advantage in the simple elimination of the variable @xmath155 must be balanced with the introduction of heavier computations .",
    "the knowledge of the angular momentum vector and of the energy at a given time allows us to compute the keplerian elements @xmath201 in fact the semimajor axis @xmath202 and the eccentricity @xmath203 can be computed from the energy and the size of the angular momentum through the relations @xmath204 the longitude of the node @xmath205 and the inclination @xmath206 are obtained from the direction of the angular momentum @xmath207 the two attributables @xmath37 at epochs @xmath49 give 8 scalar data , thus the problem is over - determined . from a non - spurious pair @xmath208 ,",
    "solution of ( [ intersec ] ) , we obtain the same values of @xmath209 at both times @xmath210 , but we must check that the orbit is indeed the same , that is check the compatibility conditions @xmath211 where @xmath212 and @xmath213 are the arguments of perihelion and the mean anomalies of the body at times @xmath214 and @xmath215 is the mean motion , which is the same for the two orbits .",
    "the first of conditions ( [ compatible ] ) corresponds to the use of the fifth integral of the kepler problem , related to lenz - laplace s integral vector @xmath216 indeed the compatibility conditions ( [ compatible ] ) can not be exactly satisfied , due to both the errors in the observations and to the planetary perturbations .",
    "actually the latter are important only when the observed body undergoes a close approach to some planet in the interval between @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "thus we may be able to discard some solutions , for which the compatibility conditions are largely violated .",
    "nevertheless , we need a criterion to assess whether smaller discrepancies from the exact conditions ( [ compatible ] ) are due to the measurement uncertainty or rather due to the fact that the two attributables do not belong to the same physical object .",
    "this will be introduced in the next section .",
    "given a pair of attributables @xmath219 with covariance matrices @xmath220 , we call @xmath221 one of the solutions of the equation @xmath222 , with @xmath223 we can repeat what follows for each solution of @xmath222",

    "first , the covariance matrix describes a confidence ellipsoid where a two - body orbit , compatible with the observations and their errors , can be found .",

    "we have defined a linkage procedure between tracklets , allowing to compute preliminary orbits with covariance matrices .",
