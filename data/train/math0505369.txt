    "the rest of the argument of theorem [ hondaloc ] goes through unmodified , using the equivariant version of the local honda - moser theorem as described above , applied to the given form @xmath15 and the form @xmath551 constructed in the above coordinates .    given the reparametrization of @xmath665 via the splitting needed in the last theorem ,",
    "the following fact describes how the moment map changes .",
    "if @xmath763 is a moment map for a hamiltonian @xmath665 action @xmath764 , and @xmath765 ( i.e. @xmath766 ) , then @xmath767 is a moment map for the torus action @xmath768 .",

    "note that by definition , the image of the @xmath709 axis under @xmath772 is independent of the choice of splitting ( since it corresponds to @xmath278 ) , so there is no ambiguity in the location of the fold .",

    "it is natural to ask to what extent the theorems of the previous chapters apply . in this section",
    "we consider convexity alone .",
    "first , local convexity still holds away from @xmath496 . in some sense local convexity also holds near @xmath496 : the image of the moment map on a nice tubular neighborhood of a component @xmath505 is a convex subset of of @xmath773 . in another sense ,",
    "though , it fails , in that convex sets in the standard coordinates @xmath774 of the orbit space are not mapped to convex sets by the moment map @xmath693 .    to see how global convexity fails , it s interesting to see how the morse - bott theory of the moments in the near - symplectic case differs from that in the symplectic case of chapter 2 .",
    "let @xmath775 .",
    "for the standard fold , the moment @xmath273 is given by @xmath776 and ( suppressing the @xmath370 direction by symmetry ) its exterior derivative is @xmath777    for @xmath778 , the critical set is described by two cases : @xmath779 so in both cases , the critical set is a manifold . in these coordinates ,",

    "@xmath785 , along the critical set @xmath786 ( i.e. on the line bundle ) we have @xmath787 in this case the hessian is non - degenerate in the normal directions ( here being the x - y plane ) everywhere except at @xmath788 , and as @xmath789 crosses zero the stable manifold become unstable , so @xmath273 is not morse - bott .",
    "note that the @xmath789-axis maps under @xmath24 to the folded double @xmath709 axis , and that the change in sign corresponds to the inside normal to the image changing from down to up pointing as @xmath789 passes zero .",
    "recall , a neighborhood of each component of @xmath496 is equivariantly symplectomorphic to the standard fold , up to an integral affine transformation of the moment map and torus .",
    "so in general , the moments @xmath273 fail to be morse - bott exactly for the finite set of @xmath441 for which @xmath790 , where @xmath721 is the standard coordinate on @xmath665 and and @xmath753 is the integral transformation of @xmath665 corresponding to the choice of splitting of @xmath665 to give the symplectomorphism to the standard fold near one of the components of @xmath496 .",
    "note however that this vector is , by construction of the symplectomorphism , always in the lie algebra @xmath145 of the isotropy group @xmath130 , for @xmath732 a component of @xmath496 , so is in fact invariantly defined .    the failure of @xmath273 to be morse - bott for this small set of @xmath441 might not be so bad if the other @xmath273 behaved nicely .",
    "however , equation [ bottcase ] , shows that , depending on the sign of @xmath309 , some of the components @xmath505 of @xmath496 will have stable manifolds of dimension 3 , i.e. codimension 1 .",
    "the absence of such stable manifolds is exactly what was required to show uniqueness of local maxima . in effect , the stable manifolds of the components of @xmath496 form hypersurfaces which separate the stable manifolds of the local maxima .",
    "we can draw this hypersurface easily in the case @xmath791 , using the flat metric on @xmath510 .",
    "then the gradient is ( suppressing the @xmath370 direction by symmetry )    @xmath792    so the stable manifold of @xmath757 is the set @xmath793 .",
    "this manifold is @xmath665 invariant , so can be described by its image under @xmath693 , which is the _ negative _ @xmath709-axis .",
    "this means that the separating hypersurface divides the manifold in a way that discounts local maxima / minima due to `` going around a fold '' .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ foldcut ] .",
    "choosing @xmath794 curves the line up or down but maintains its tangency to the @xmath709-axis at the origin .    for examples of near - symplectic toric 4-manifolds",
    "whose moment maps have non - convex images , see the construction in [ near - existence ] and the final section .      in this section",

    "since all the models are symplectic , the fibres are collapsed the same way over the edges , and the identification is a symplectomorphism on the open dense set where the fibres are @xmath665 , the identification is a symplectomorphism everywhere .",
    "we claim that the resulting manifold is @xmath908 : we ve connected two copies of @xmath909 using a patch whose image under the moment map is given on the left side of figure [ patch ] .",

    "the patching corresponds to that for the connected sum .",
    "the construction in section [ near - existence ] guarantees the existence of near - symplectic toric 4-manifolds of a wide variety which may be less familiar .",

    "one obvious direction for further work is to see whether a generalization of karshon s classification of 4-manifolds with hamiltonian @xmath588-actions is true in the near - symplectic case , and in particular whether her result that `` isolated fixed points implies toric variety '' is true .",
