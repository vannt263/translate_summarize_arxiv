    "including the dynamical quark loop effects in large - scale qcd simulations is one of the most important and urgent problem . while in the real world there are three light quarks , most of recent studies have concentrated on the case of two flavors of wilson - type fermions because these systems can be simulated by the exact hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) algorithm .",
    "recently , however , a major progress has been made in the exact fermion algorithm applicable to odd number of flavors as reviewed in ref .",
    "in particular , we have succeeded in developing an efficient algorithm for @xmath0 qcd with the @xmath1-improved wilson fermion action in the framework of the hmc algorithm .",
    "leaving algorithmic details to a separate report  @xcite , we present here the first result toward realistic @xmath0 qcd simulations with the @xmath1-improved wilson fermion .",
    "we found that this theory has an unexpected first - order phase transition at zero - temperature , which gives a strong constraint on the form of lattice actions suitable for large - scale simulations .",

    "to see the global phase structure in the ( @xmath24 ) plane , we perform rapid thermal cycles on @xmath25 and @xmath26 lattices",
    ". fixing @xmath19 we increase @xmath27 from @xmath28 in steps of 0.01 until the algorithm fails to converge and then decrease @xmath27 to 0 .",

    "the position of the phase transition line significantly moves from @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",

    "[ fig : fig4 ] , we plot the plaquette values in the two phases at the phase transition line as functions of @xmath19 for @xmath26 and @xmath34 lattices .",
    "the gap in the plaquette is almost independent of the lattice size .",
    "these findings strongly suggests that the first - order transition line persists in infinite lattice volume and zero temperature .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig4 ] also shows that the gap in the plaquette decreases almost linearly in @xmath19 and vanishes at around @xmath36 . since no signs of transitions",
    "are observed at @xmath37 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , we do not think that this point corresponds to a tricritical point where a first - order phase transition line changes to a second - order one which then extends toward weaker couplings .",
    "rather , the observed first - order transition must be a lattice artifact restricted to strong coupling regions .",
    "to confirm this possibility , we repeat thermal cycle simulations employing the improved gauge action with @xmath38 ( rg action  @xcite ) and @xmath39 ( tadpole - improved symanzik action  @xcite ) . here",

    "no signs of hysteresis loops are seen , and hence non - trivial phase structure is absent with this gauge action .",
    "hysteresis is also not seen for the tadpole - improved symanzik gauge action .",
    "we conclude that the first - order phase transition observed for the plaquette gauge action has the nature of a lattice artifact .",
    "it has been known @xcite that pure @xmath41 gauge theory with fundamental and adjoint couplings has a first - order transition for positive values of the adjoint coupling .",
    "it is an interesting possibility that the clover term produces a positive adjoint coupling in an effective theory after integrating out the fermion degrees of freedom , which eventually causes the first - order phase transition observed in this work .",
    "in fact we have checked that there are no sign of phase transitions in thermal cycles made with the unimproved wilson fermion action ( @xmath42 ) and plaquette gauge action ( @xmath15 ) on a @xmath26 lattice , which supports our interpretation .",
    "our finding poses a serious practical problem whether realistic simulations with reasonable values of the lattice spacing @xmath43 are possible with the @xmath1-improved wilson fermion and the plaquette gauge action . to study this problem",

    "continuum extrapolations using lattices with @xmath50 starting at 2.58 gev is not practical .",
