    "models of closed loops on lattices in two dimensions have attracted considerable attention @xcite . in a theoretical context",
    "they arise naturally as high - temperature expansions of spin models and they are closely related to integrable systems such as vertex models @xcite .",
    "loops on a lattice may also be regarded as simple models for ( short ) ring polymers in solution @xcite .",
    "the segments of the loop are then regarded as monomers , or small clusters of monomers . while realistic systems are three - dimensional , the two - dimensional case provides rich critical behaviour , and it may be hoped that some features hold in higher dimensions .",
    "solid - on - solid models used in the study of roughening transitions in three - dimensional growth may also be mapped onto various two - dimensional loop - gas models @xcite .    in this paper a model of loops",
    "is studied , consisting of self - avoiding rings with a bending energy .",
    "we are mainly interested in the effects of varying the density of monomers on the lattice and the temperature .",
    "the model is defined as follows .",
    "each bond of the lattice is either occupied by a monomer or empty .",
    "each monomer placed on the lattice connects to two others such that the only allowed configurations consist of closed self - avoiding loops .",
    "an energy penalty @xmath0 is associated with each turn .",
    "the density of lattice bonds occupied is allowed to change , and the model is studied in the grand canonical ensemble by introducing a fugacity @xmath1 for each monomer .    on the square lattice , and in the limit that the lattice is maximally occupied ( all the sites visited ) this model corresponds to the so - called f  model @xcite , which exhibits an infinite order phase transition as the bending energy , or equivalently temperature , is varied . at low temperatures corners",
    "are expelled from the bulk , while at high temperatures there is a proliferation of corners .",
    "a qualitatively similar transition is seen in a model of a single hamiltonian walk on the square lattice with a bending energy @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian walk may be thought of as the limit of an interacting self - avoiding walk where the attractive nearest - neighbour monomer - monomer interactions are strong enough to exclude any lattice vacancies . in the other limit , the non - interacting self - avoiding walk ,",
    "it is known that the bending energy is irrelevant @xcite ; it changes the effective size of a monomer without changing the critical behaviour . at low enough densities",
    "we expect that for the loop - gas model the bending energy will also be irrelevant in this sense .",
    "one therefore expects that between zero density ( bending interaction irrelevant ) and density one ( bending interaction relevant ) there should be a `` critical '' density corresponding to a change of behaviour .",
    "in this paper we study the loop gas model on the brickwork lattice .",
    "the brickwork lattice corresponds to a square lattice with half the horizontal bonds removed , giving rise to the `` brick wall '' motif , see figure  1 .",
    "the brickwork lattice is topologically identical to the hexagonal lattice .    at density",
    "one we find a qualitatively similar phase transition to that on the standard square lattice in that there is a low temperature phase in which the corners are expelled from the bulk and a high temperature phase where there is a finite density of corners in the bulk .",
    "the details of the transition are however very different : the transition occurs at a tricritical lifschitz point and the high - temperature phase is modulated and critical .",
    "such a phase transition is reminiscent of the pokrovsky - talapov transition @xcite . in this",
    "limit our model is equivalent to a modified kdp model on the hexagonal lattice @xcite .",
    "the existence of a modulated phase at @xmath2 implies the existence of lines of disorder in the phase diagram @xcite , along which the correlation functions change from modulated at high densities to monotonic at low densities .",
    "as the density is reduced the tricritical point is extended into a line of critical points in the ising universality class which terminates at zero temperature at a critical density of about 0.8 . for @xmath3 , or at low density",
    ", another line of critical points is observed , again in the ising universality class ; our model in this region is essentially the ising model on the hexagonal lattice with one of the three couplings different from the other two .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ ii ] , the grand canonical partition function ( and other relevant quantities ) is calculated by expressing it first in terms of grassman integrals , which are then exactly computed in the thermodynamic limit . in section  [ iii ] the @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) limit",
    "is discussed , along with the nature of the low and high temperature phases . in section  [ iv ] the phase boundaries and lines of disorder",
    "are found and the different aspects of the phase diagram discussed .",
    "section  [ v ] is devoted to final discussions and conclusions .",
    "we consider a two dimensional gas of loops on a brickwork lattice ( bw ) .",
    "the loops are self - avoiding , and we assign a fugacity @xmath1 to each occupied link .",
    "this bw lattice can be visualized as a honeycomb ( hc ) lattice ( see fig .  1 ) , and we associate a weight of @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the inverse temperature ) to each corner of a loop or equivalently @xmath8 to horizontal links .",
    "this model is a straightforward extension of the f - model to the bw lattice .",
    "the aim of this paper is to calculate the phase diagram and properties of this system as a function of the site density @xmath9 ( or equivalently bond fugacity @xmath1 ) and temperature .",
    "the grand canonical partition function @xmath10 of the system is given by : [ grand_canon ] z&=&_n=0^k^n z_n + & = & e^-f(k , t ) where @xmath11 is the total number of sites of the lattice of linear dimension @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the @xmath14site partition function . as usual , the canonical partition function at site density @xmath15 can be obtained through ( [ grand_canon ] ) by : [ canon ] z_n&= & e^- + & = & e^-f_c(,t ) in the thermodynamic limit , we have the usual relation = k k z    the loop gas can be identified with the graphs of the high - temperature expansion of an ising model on a bw lattice , with a weight @xmath1 per vertical bond and @xmath16 per horizontal bond .",

    "the high - temperature phase is modulated in the @xmath35-direction with a wave vector given by eq .",
    "( [ k_crit ] )    the same critical behaviour is also seen in the zero - temperature phase diagram of the frustrated ising model on the triangular lattice with appropriately chosen coupling constants @xcite .",
    "this model may be mapped onto a tiling consisting of three types of lozenge @xcite .",
    "one lozenge has a lower energy than the other two .",
    "at zero temperature , the tiling must be perfect .",
    "one rapidly realises that the only way of introducing a lozenge of higher energy is to introduce an infinite line of them .",
    "identifying the side of a lozenge with the bisector of an occupied bond on the dual hexagonal lattice , our loop model may be seen as equivalent to this lozenge tiling ( see fig .  4 ) .",

    ", the critical behaviour of the correlation functions can be analysed ; a generic correlation function is given by : g(r ) = 1 _ 0^_0^d^2 k up to a regular multiplication factor .",

    "( [ k_crit ] ) setting @xmath49 and @xmath50 , this becomes : g(x , y ) ~e^-i k y d q_x",
    "d q_y the exponential prefactor gives the expected spatial modulation in the y - direction , and the correlation function has a logarithmic behaviour at large distances .    around the tricritical point ,",
    "the critical wave vector vanishes as well as the coefficient of the @xmath51 term , and the expansion must be carried to the next order : g(x , y ) ~d q_x d q_y where @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , the correlation functions have anisotropic scaling , with critical exponents @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we now move to the dilute case @xmath55 .",

    "this behaviour is completely different from the critical behaviour of the analogously defined model on the square lattice at @xmath2 ( the f - model ) .",
    "this is due to the combination of two effects ; the brickwork lattice automatically imposes self - avoidance without the inclusion of additional fugacities , and the brickwork lattice is intrinsically asymmetric .    the phase diagram is given in the @xmath65 ( and equivalently the @xmath57 ) plane .",
