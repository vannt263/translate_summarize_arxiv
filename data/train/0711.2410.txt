    "the phenomenon of anderson localization @xcite has been studied both experimentally and theoretically for already half a century @xcite .",
    "it takes place for waves in strongly disordered media when interference effects become plethoric in the multiple scattering process",
    ". theoretical description of anderson localization reached a decisive stage in the eighties with the self - consistent ( sc ) theory of vollhardt and wlfle @xcite .",
    "however , in its original form , this theory did not fully account for finite - size effects .",
    "later , van tiggelen _ et al . _ proposed a natural generalization of sc theory to media of finite size by introducing a _ position - dependent _ diffusion coefficient @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this generalized sc theory has been recently used to study the dynamics of anderson localization in quasi - one - dimensional @xcite and three - dimensional @xcite systems . meanwhile , the generalized sc equations of refs .",
    "have never been derived microscopically .",
    "such a derivation is highly desirable for at least two reasons .",
    "first , our recent results indicate that the position dependence of @xmath0 is crucial for the internal consistency of the theory itself and that some of the important features of anderson localization ( like the @xmath1 scaling of the transmission coefficient with the size @xmath2 of a disordered sample at the mobility edge ) can not be reproduced without fully taking it into account @xcite .",
    "second , the very fact that @xmath0 should be position - dependent can be questioned in favor of momentum @xcite or time @xcite dependencies studied in the past , unless the position dependence of @xmath0 is given a microscopic justification .",
    "this calls for a rigorous derivation of sc equations in a medium of finite size , showing the emergence of position - dependent @xmath0 from microscopic equations of wave propagation and clarifying the physics behind it .    in this paper",
    "we present a derivation of sc equations of localization in a finite medium of size @xmath2 much exceeding the two main `` microscopic '' length scales of the problem : the wavelength @xmath3 and the mean free path @xmath4 due to disorder . our derivation is based on the `` hikami box '' formalism @xcite .",
    "we work in the framework of classical wave scattering , but our results can be extended to quantum particles ( e.g. , an electron or an atom at low temperatures ) described by schrdinger equation with a disordered potential . whereas electronic properties of disordered systems have been a subject of intense studies over several decades @xcite , the behavior of coherent atomic ensembles ( bose - einstein condensates ) in disordered optical lattices has come into focus only recently @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the finiteness of the medium comes into play when we evaluate interference corrections to the sum of ladder diagrams .",
    "these interference corrections are due to infinite series of maximally - crossed diagrams that we insert inside the ladders . in the presence of time - reversal invariance ,",
    "the final result depends on the probability for the wave ( or quantum particle ) to return back to a given point @xmath5 . whereas , due to the translational and rotational invariance , this return probability is a position - independent quantity in the infinite medium , it becomes position - dependent in a medium of finite size . in an open medium ,",
    "the return probability decreases when the boundary of the medium is approached because of the increased probability for the wave to leave the medium through the boundary .",
    "this leads to a position - dependent renormalized diffusion coefficient @xmath0 , the renormalization being less important near the boundaries of the disordered medium .",
    "the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath5 is not known in advance , but has to be determined self - consistently by solving a diffusion equation containing the same @xmath0 .",
    "anderson localization is often defined as an asymptotic property of eigenstates of disordered wave ( schrdinger , helmholtz , etc . )",
    "the states are said ( exponentially ) localized if their intensity decays exponentially at large distances .",
    "another widespread definition of anderson localization is vanishing of the diffusion coefficient @xcite . strictly speaking",
    ", none of these definitions can be directly applied in open media of finite size , which were a subject of extensive work initiated by thouless @xcite and culminated in the scaling theory of localization @xcite .",
    "we are not intended to give a review of this work here and the interested reader can find more details in refs .",
    "@xcite . for our purposes",
    "it will be sufficient to think of `` anderson localization in a medium of finite size '' as of an interference , wave phenomenon that would give rise to `` truly localized '' states if the medium were extended to infinity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ iii ] we sum an infinite series of diagrams for the intensity green s function and obtain the sc equations of localization .",

    "we consider propagation of a scalar , monochromatic wave of circular frequency @xmath6 in a disordered three - dimensional medium of finite size .",

    "this equation holds in the infinite as well as in finite media , provided that it is supplemented with appropriate boundary conditions @xcite in the latter case .",
    "obviously , eq .  ( [ eq_for_c_infinite ] ) ignores interference effect and treats the wave as a classical particle that propagates through a disordered medium by diffusion .",
