    "higher @xmath4 a number of different phases may exist , including : an antiferromagnetic insulator state , ferromagnetism , and d - wave superconductivity@xcite . it was also proposed that in two - dimensions metallic non - fermi liquid states may exist at large @xmath4 , such as the resonant - valence - bond ( rvb)@xcite or luttinger liquid@xcite state , and the flux - phase@xcite . whether or not these phases actually exist as stable ground states of the hubbard model remains controversial , despite considerable numerical and analytic effort to solve the two dimensional hubbard model .",
    "similarly , whether or not d - wave superconductivity occurs in the positive @xmath2 hubbard model is also unclear at the present time .",
    "of course both non - fermi liquid behavior and d - wave superconductivity appear to occur experimentally in the cuprates@xcite , where it is generally believed that the hubbard model is appropriate .",
    "indeed the two - dimensional hubbard model can be derived for the cuprates from the _ ab initio _ density functional electronic structure under certain simplifying assumptions@xcite .",
    "however it still remains unclear whether the hubbard model is sufficient to explain all of the anomalous properties of the cuprates , or whether one must also include physical effects beyond the hubbard hamiltonian , such as electron - phonon coupling or multiple electronic bands .    in this paper",
    "we use the fluctuation exchange approximation@xcite , flex , to investigate the electronic structure and phase diagram for the two - dimensional hubbard model .",
    "we pay particular attention to the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phase and the effect of antiferromagnetic fluctuations near to the afm transition .",
    "the theory of nearly - antiferromagnetic fermi liquids has been recently developed by pines and co - workers@xcite .",
    "although based upon a fermi liquid approach , the theory explains some of the non - fermi liquid like properties of the cuprates in terms of the appearance of ` hot spots ' on the fermi surface where the quasiparticle scattering rate is unusually high .",
    "altmann , brenig and kampf@xcite have recently shown that the flex approximation is able to describe these ` hot spots ' .",
    "below we investigate in detail the regions of parameter space ( e.g. temperature , @xmath5 , band filling , @xmath6 , and hopping @xmath7 ) where these ` hot spots ' occur .",
    "a second experimental feature of the cuprates is the appearance of a temperature scale @xmath8 ( or more than one such temperature scale ) distinct from both the nel temperature @xmath9 and the superconducting transition temperature @xmath10 .",
    "below @xmath8 a loss of spectral weight occurs in the low energy excitations , referred to as a pseudogap or spin - gap@xcite .",
    "the pseudogap can be seen directly in the angle resolved photoemission experiments@xcite ( arpes ) as a small k - dependent shift of the spectral edge relative to an absolute reference such as a good metal in electrical contact with the superconductor .",
    "below we discuss the appearance of both @xmath8 and the pseudogap in terms of the flex calculations for the hubbard model .",
    "finally we also examine in detail the effects of the van hove singularity in the density of states in the two dimensional hubbard model .",
    "the existence of van hove singularities close to the fermi energy is a feature of _ ab initio _ band structures of the cuprates@xcite .",
    "the presence of the van hove singularity near to the fermi surface can lead to a dramatic increase in @xmath10 as a function of doping@xcite .",
    "the proximity to the van hove singularity can also be a source of non - fermi liquid electron - electron scattering rates .",
    "we show below that the ` hot spots ' and the @xmath8 behavior are assosciated with the antiferromagnetism , while the approximately linear in @xmath5 scattering rate derives from the proximity to the van hove singularity . at small @xmath2 ( and @xmath11 ) these two effects exist quite separately at different band fillings , while at larger @xmath2 ( or @xmath12 ) both effects coexist for a wide range of doping levels .",
    "the flex method was originally introduced by bickers and scalapino@xcite .",
    "it has been discussed by many previous authors@xcite , so we present only a brief outline . flex makes use of the similarity of the ` ladder ' diagrams to the ` bubble ' diagrams from rpa when the electron - electron interaction is an on - site interaction , as in the hubbard model : @xmath13 flex sums both the ladder and rpa bubble diagrams , it is exact to order @xmath14 ( while rpa is only exact to @xmath15 ) and is a conserving approximation in the sense of baym@xcite .",

    "were analytically continued from the matsubara frequencies to the real axis .",

    "the continued fraction approximant for @xmath43 defines the retarded green s function in the upper - half plane .",

    "the chemical potential , @xmath24 , was kept fixed during the self - consistent runs , and then the band filling , @xmath45 , was calculated from the final green s function @xmath46 this greatly speeded up the calculations compared to adjusting @xmath24 at each iteration during the self - consistency cycle in order to maintain a given density @xmath45 . because the @xmath45 changes slightly at a function of @xmath5 for fixed @xmath24 this leads to small changes in density as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "for example the case where @xmath12 and @xmath47 the densities for temperatures of @xmath48 and @xmath49 were @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively .",
    "these small changes in the density do not significantly alter our results .    in order to investigate the effects of the electronic band structure of the cuprates we performed calculations for both the nearest neighbor hopping only hubbard model ( @xmath12 ) , and for a more realistic cuprate band structure of @xmath52 . in the case",
    "@xmath12 we concentrated our attention on the region near to half filling , @xmath53 , and to an interaction strength of @xmath54 . exactly at half filling the fermi surface is perfectly nested along @xmath55 , and this also coincides with the van hove singularity in the density of states .",
    "it is difficult therefore to distinguish the relative importance of nesting and the van hove singularity .",

    "we can then see that the linear temperature dependence is associated with the van hove crossing point and not afm .",
    "figure [ gamtd3u2 ] shows the temperature dependence of the scattering energy for various densities with @xmath143 .",
    "the density region where there is a linear temperature dependence has now been reduced to a small region around a density of @xmath144 which corresponds to the point where the fermi energy is on the van hove singularity in the density of states . for densities above @xmath145 and below @xmath146",
    "there is a @xmath121 behavior , or a least a positive curvature at low temperature . for half filling",
    "the temperature dependence shows a slight up turn at low temperatures , indicating a ` hot spot ' with a small @xmath8 , although no afm phase is observed down to a temperature of @xmath48 .",
    "there are no hot spots at any other filling for @xmath143 .    as well as",
    "the scattering rate displaying linear temperature dependence for densities around @xmath144 the dependence of the scattering rate with band energy , @xmath69 , is also linear .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ bgamma5 ] which is for @xmath147 and @xmath143 . for @xmath98",
    "the energy dependence of the scattering rate is masked by the increased anisotropy of the system . despite this the energy dependence of @xmath70 apears to be linear when the temperature dependence is also linear .",
    "the influence of the van hove singularity can be most clearly seen in a plot of the scattering rate as a function of doping , fig .",
    "[ td3t06gm ] . in this plot",
    "the maximum in the scattering energy for @xmath143 , which occurs at @xmath144 , is also mirrored by a peak in the scattering energy for @xmath98 .",
    "although the @xmath98 plots are dominated by the enhancements from the fermi surface ` hot spots ' occuring near half filling .",
    "in our calculated quasiparticle scattering rate @xmath70 we observe two distinct non - fermi liquid phenomena : regions of linear in temperature dependence of @xmath70 , and hot spots , a localized increase in the scattering rate with decreasing temperature . fig . [ phase ] shows the regions of density and temperature at which these two separate phenomena can be observed .",
    "the top panel to fig .",
    "[ phase ] shows relevant regions in the phase diagram of the nearest neighbor hubbard model with @xmath12 and @xmath98 .",
    "the system is symmetrical around half filling and the afm phase extends to @xmath148 . near the boundaries of the antiferromagnetic region we observe ` hot spot ' behavior , and the corresponding pseudogap temperature @xmath8 of the upturn in @xmath70",
    "is marked on the figure .",
    "however one can see from fig .",
    "[ phase ] that fermi liquid behavior is not recovered ouside the region of antiferromagnetism until a density of more than @xmath149 away from half filling . for densities between the afm phase and @xmath150 @xmath70",
    "is dominated by a linear temperature dependence .",
    "the second panel in fig .",
    "[ phase ] shows how this behavior is modified by a non - zero @xmath23 ( @xmath52 ) and the same value of @xmath2 . in this case",
    "the phase diagram is no longer symmetrical .",
    "the afm region is centred just above half - filling , so that the afm phase is destroyed much more quickly with p - type as opposed to n - type doping , similar to the experimental behavior in the cuprates .",
    "the ` hot spot ' behavior is now confined to the p - type side of the afm phase , and fermi liquid behavior begins immediately after the antiferromagnetism is destroyed for n - type doping .",
    "below half filling there is a wide region of marginal fermi liquid behavior ( mfl on the figure ) corresponding to a linear temperature dependence of @xmath70 .",
    "this mfl region is centered around the van hove singularity and extends down as far as @xmath151 .",
    "finally , the bottom panel in fig .  [ phase ] shows the behavior at the smaller value of @xmath143 and the same value of @xmath52 . here",
    "the antiferromagnetism has essentially disappeared , as has the ` hot spot ' behavior . on the other hand",
    "there is still a mfl region , which is very clearly centered on the van hove singularity at @xmath152 .",
    "our calculations have ramifications for a number of the current theories of high temperature superconductivity .",
    "firstly the observations of ` hot spots ' , with a corresponding pseudogap temperature scale , @xmath8 , supports the concepts of _ hot- _ and _ cold - quasiparticles _ as advocated by pines and others@xcite .",
    "we find that this behavior is a consequence of the proximity to the afm phase , and would be especially pronounced in the underdoped p - type cuprates ( assuming that the physical parameters are roughly similar to those of the central panel in fig .",
    "[ phase ] ) , as is indeed the case experimentally . from the calculations described in this paper",
    "we indeed see that the ` hot spots ' are associated with quasiparticles with increased scattering located near the singular points on the fermi surface connected by the afm wave vector @xmath153 , as also noted previously by altmann , brenig and kampf@xcite .    on the other hand , the ` hot spot ' behavior appears to be unrelated to the mfl behavior ( @xmath154 ) which we also observe .",
    "the parameter region where these _ hot - quasiparticles _ occur is confined to a small region near to the afm transition , and the temperature dependence of the scattering rate of the ` hot spot ' quasiparticles is not linear in temperature .",
    "we observe mfl behavior over a much wider region of parameter space than the ` hot spots ' .",
    "for @xmath98 the mfl and hot spot behavior may occur at the same band fillings , but on different pieces of fermi surface .",
    "however for band fillings further away from the afm phase only mfl is observed . for @xmath143",
    "both the afm and the ` hot spot ' behavior are suppressed , showing clearly that the mfl behavior originates in the proximity to the van hove singularity not the afm .",
    "this observation is in agreement with the scattering rate predictions of the van hove scenario theories of the cuprates@xcite .",
    "note that we have only performed normal - state calculations , and so have not included any possible d - wave superconducting phases in fig .",
    ". we can not therefore comment on the existence of superconductivity induced by spin fluctuations near to the afm phase boundary@xcite or whether the van hove singularity also plays a role in enhancing the superconductivity@xcite .",
    "in summary we find that the van hove singularity produces marginal fermi liquid behavior , scattering rates linearly dependent on temperature , while the afm phase is associated with _ hot - quasiparticles_. these _ hot - quasiparticles _ are characterised by increasing scattering rates with decreasing temperature , have a characteristic pseudogap temperature scale @xmath8 , and are localized to a small region of the bz near the points where the fermi surface crosses the diagonal and are connected by the antiferromagnetic wave vector @xmath153 .",
