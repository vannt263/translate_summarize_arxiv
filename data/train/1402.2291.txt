    "disk galaxies possess prominent non - axisymmetric features such as spiral arms and bars that have profound influences on galactic evolution in various ways ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "stellar spiral arms not only trigger or organize star formation in the outer parts of disk galaxies but also drive secular changes in the orbits of stars and gas clouds , redistributing the mass in the disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "bar potentials also affect the mass redistributions in the inner parts and are responsible for the formation of various gaseous substructures such as dust lanes and nuclear rings ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "understanding the gravitational interaction of the stellar potentials with a gaseous medium is therefore the first step to understand star formation , secular evolution , and morphological changes occurring in disk galaxies .    among various secular processes ,",
    "an angular momentum exchange between gas and a stellar pattern is particularly interesting since it leads to overall gas inflows or outflows in the radial direction . in barred galaxies",
    ", it has been well established that a non - axisymmetric torque exerted by a bar potential produces a pair of dust lanes in the gaseous medium , across which the gas loses angular momentum and falls radially inward to form a nuclear ring ( e.g. , @xcite ) , potentially powering star burst activities in nuclear rings as well as fueling active galactic nuclei ( e.g. @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", @xcite demonstrated that the location of nuclear rings is determined not by the resonances but by the centrifugal barrier that the inflowing gas can not overcome .",
    "this suggests that nuclear rings are smaller in size in more strongly - barred galaxies , entirely consistent with the observational results of @xcite .",
    "compared to the cases with a bar potential , the effects of a spiral potential on the gaseous structures and radial mass inflow are relatively poorly understood . while interactions of stellar density waves with stars and the associated stellar heating and radial migration have been a subject of intense study ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) , only a few studies have explored angular momentum loss of gas due to the density waves ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , @xcite considered non - self - gravitating galactic spiral shocks and showed that the damping timescale of stellar density waves due to the angular momentum exchange is of the order of @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite included the back reaction of the density waves on the gas density distribution , finding that the gas accretion rate due to the stellar pattern amounts to @xmath6@xmath7 for parameters representing the solar neighborhood in the milky way .",
    "these values of @xmath8 are overall consistent with the mass inflows inferred from chemical modeling in the milky way @xcite and also those in external galaxies based on gravitational torque analyses @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the epicycle approximation to derive an analytic expression for @xmath8 due to a non - axisymmetric potential .",
    "while the derivations of @xmath8 by @xcite and @xcite are insightful , they utilized a few notable approximations .",
    "first , @xcite considered local , tightly - wound waves in both the stellar and gaseous media and ignored the self - gravitational torque on the gas in evaluating @xmath8 .",
    "they also included shear viscosity to represent cloud collisions , which tends to smear out shock profiles and thus makes it difficult to isolate the sole effect of the shock ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite used the orbit crossing of test particles as a criterion for the shock formation , without considering the effects of gas pressure as well as the speed of incident flows relative to the pattern . although @xcite showed that their @xmath8 is in good agreement with their numerical results for galaxies with a dominant bar - like potential , it is uncertain whether the same holds true for spiral galaxies in which the effects of thermal and ram pressures are more important than in barred galaxies .",
    "since dynamics involved with spiral arms is intrinsically nonlinear , it is desirable to run numerical hydrodynamic simulations in order to measure the mass drift rates driven by spiral arms properly .",
    "there have been numerous studies for gas responses to an imposed spiral potential , focusing on morphological changes of gaseous arms depending on the pattern speed ( e.g. , @xcite ) , formation of arm substructures such as branches , spurs , and feathers ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also local models of @xcite ) , or star formation occurring in spiral arms ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while the arm - driven mass inflows might have affected the simulation outcomes in the work mentioned above , its rate has yet to be evaluated to assess its dynamical consequences on secular evolution quantitatively .    in this paper , we run global hydrodynamic simulations for gas evolution in galaxies with spiral potentials .",
    "we consider an infinitesimally - thin , uniform gaseous disk .",
    "we take an isothermal equation of state for the gas , and ignore the effect of radiative cooling and heating , star formation , and magnetic fields . two important parameters characterizing a spiral pattern",
    "are its angular frequency @xmath9 and strength @xmath10 , which are difficult to constrain observationally .",
    "thus we in this work vary @xmath9 and @xmath10 as free parameters to model spiral arms in various galactic situations , and study how @xmath8 depends on them .",
    "we will also compare our numerical results with the analytic expression presented in @xcite .",
    "in addition to evaluating @xmath8 , our models are also useful to address important issues related to the spatial extent , structures , and pitch angles of gaseous arms in comparison with their stellar counterparts .",
    "while the theory for spiral density waves suggests that the _ stellar _ pattern extends up to the corotation resonance ( cr ) or to the outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) if it is in the linear - regime ( e.g. , @xcite ) and to the 4/1 resonance if it is strong enough to be nonlinear @xcite , it is uncertain whether the termination of _ gaseous _ arms corresponds to the resonance radii .",
    "moreover , @xcite showed using both semi - analytic and numerical approaches that gaseous arms are in general more tightly wound than the stellar arms .",
    "although large uncertainties surround observational determinations of arm pitch angles , recent studies show that they are , statistically , slightly larger in the @xmath11- or @xmath12-band than in the @xmath13-band @xcite , suggesting that the gaseous arms are likely more tightly wound than the stellar counterpart .",
    "we will show that the extent and pitch angles of gaseous arms are dependent somewhat sensitively upon the arm pattern speed .",
    "we will also show that the distributions of line - of - sight velocities in the projected galactic disk and density profiles of gaseous arms can be used to tell whether the observed arms are inside their cr or not .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , we describe the galaxy model and our choices of the model parameters , as well as the numerical method we use . in section [ sec : arm ] , we present the simulation results on morphologies of spiral shocks . in section [ sec :",

    "[ sec : los ] , we present the distributions of line - of - sight velocities in the plane of sky and discuss how they can be used to obtain information on the arm pattern speed . in section [ sec : sum_dis ] , we conclude with a summary and discussion of our results and their astronomical implications .",
    "we consider an infinitesimally - thin , self - gravitating gaseous disk , and study its nonlinear responses to an imposed non - axisymmetric potential representing stellar spiral arms .",
    "the disk is assumed to be unmagnetized and isothermal , for simplicity .",
    "the basic equations of hydrodynamics expanded in the @xmath14 plane corotating with the spiral potential are @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the gas surface density , @xmath19 is the velocity in the rotating frame , @xmath20 is the isothermal speed of sound , @xmath21 is the pattern speed of the spiral arms , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the external gravitational potential and self - gravitational potential , respectively . in equation ( [ eq : grav ] ) , the function @xmath24 is introduced to account for the dilution of self - gravity at the disk mid - plane due to finite disk thickness : we take a gaussian profile with thickness of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the velocity @xmath26 in the inertial frame is obtained from @xmath27 .",
    "the external gravitational potential consists of an axisymmetric component and a non - axisymmetric spiral component @xmath28 .",
    "the static axisymmetric part responsible for galaxy rotation is comprised of a stellar disk , a spherical bulge / halo , and a central black hole with mass @xmath29 , identical to that in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig - rot ] plots the resulting rotation curve , with a flat part with @xmath30 over most of the disk plane and a rapidly rising part as @xmath31 toward the center due to the presence of the black hole .    for the non - axisymmetric spiral potential",

    "note that @xmath28 is tapered from @xmath36 to @xmath37 by a gaussian function to have @xmath38 at @xmath39 .",
    "the amplitude of the spiral potential @xmath40 in equation ( [ eq : sp1 ] ) is controlled by the dimensionless parameter @xmath41 which measures the gravitational force due to the spiral arms in the direction perpendicular to the arms relative to the radial force from the background axisymmetric potential ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we fix @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "we vary @xmath10 from 5 to 20% to study situations with differing arm strength .     of our galaxy model as a function of the galactocentric radius @xmath45 . over much of the disk , @xmath46 , corresponding to a normal disk galaxy.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "it is quite challenging to measure the pattern speeds of spiral arms .",
    "self - consistent modeling of the milky way shows that stability and observed tangent points of the spiral arms are best described by @xmath47 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand , analyses based on the @xcite s method",
    "indicate that the arms in external galaxies have pattern speeds in a wide range of @xmath48@xmath49 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath50-body simulations for the formation of non - axisymmetric features in disk galaxies also show that the angular frequency of spiral arms is diverse ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we in this paper consider three different cases : @xmath51 ( fast arm models ) , @xmath47 ( intermediate - speed arm models ) , and @xmath52 ( slow arm models ) . in",
    "what follows , we refer to these as the f , i , and s models , respectively .",
    "the positions of the cr , the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) , and the 4/1 resonance are @xmath53 , 9.9 , and @xmath54 , @xmath55 , 3.6 , and @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , 6.4 , and @xmath58 for the f , i , and s models , respectively .",
    "we run 18 models that differ in @xmath10 , @xmath9 , and the presence or absence of gaseous self - gravity .",
    "table [ tbl : model ] lists the model parameters .",
    "the prefixes `` f '' , `` i '' , and `` s '' stand for the models with fast , intermediate - speed , and slow arms , while the postfixes `` g '' and `` n '' indicate self - gravitating and non - self - gravitating models , respectively . in all models , the gas sound speed is taken to @xmath59 that effectively includes a contribution of turbulent motions ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for models in which self - gravity",
    "is considered , @xmath23 is calculated by using the @xcite scheme described in @xcite .",
    "all the models start from a gaseous disk with uniform surface density @xmath60 .",
    "we take models f10 g , i10 g , and s10 g with @xmath61 as our fiducial models .    .model",
    "parameters[tbl : model ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     using equations ( [ eq : mext ] ) and ( [ eq : mself ] ) , we calculate @xmath62 and @xmath63 from our numerical results , and then @xmath64 from equation ( [ eq : mflux ] ) . figure [ fig - mdot - anal ] plots the radial distributions of @xmath64 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 from the self - gravitating , slow arm models .",
    "these values averaged over @xmath65 or @xmath66 are listed in columns ( 4)(9 ) of table [ tbl - mdot ] for all the models . as expected , @xmath64 is negative in most of the region inside the cr and positive outside the cr , although @xmath67 does not correspond exactly to the cr .",
    "this is because the inner and outer spiral shocks extend across the cr , as explained in section [ sec : str ] .",
    "since the effect of the inner shocks is stronger on the mass drift than that of the outer shocks , @xmath67 occurs at @xmath68 , roughly independent of @xmath10 , slightly outside the cr . well inside the cr , @xmath62 is negative mostly due to the torque on the gas in the postshock expanding zones rather than on the gas at the shock fronts .",
    "although the latter has the highest density , its contribution to @xmath62 turns out to be insignificant , except near the cr , since it is located very close to the potential minima in the s models .",
    "near the cr , @xmath62 becomes positive due to the torque on the gas at the shock fronts that are displaced substantially from the potential minima toward the upstream direction .",
    "the self - gravitational torque overwhelms the other torques outside the cr .",
    "this is because self - gravity becomes relatively more important at larger @xmath45 , as equation ( [ eq : toomre ] ) suggests .",
    "in addition , gaseous arms in outer regions are bounded by two spiral shocks and thus relatively thick .",
    "figure [ fig - cut ] compares the azimuthal distributions of gas surface density together with the spiral and self - gravitational potentials at ( left ) @xmath69 and ( right ) @xmath70 in model s10 g at @xmath71 .",
    "the shock - bounded arms outside the cr form at the expense of lower interarm density and thus have stronger self - gravitational forces , compared to those inside the cr . note that the density distribution at @xmath72 is slightly asymmetric with respect to the minima of @xmath23 , with larger density at the side with @xmath73 .",
    "the corresponding self - gravitational torque is thus negative over most of the simulation domain .",
    "a stronger spiral potential leads to larger @xmath74 .",
    "our numerical results for the mass drift for all self - gravitating models can be fitted as @xmath75 and @xmath76 in units of @xmath77 , both of which are accurate within @xmath78 for @xmath79 . in these models , the angular momentum loss at spiral shocks , the external gravitational torque , and the self - gravitational torque account for about @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 of the total , on average , respectively , roughly independent of @xmath10 . in the s models ,",
    "the corresponding radial inflow velocity is @xmath83 at @xmath84 , with the associated timescale comparable to the hubble time .",
    "the distribution of line - of - sight velocities in the plane of sky can be a useful diagnostic tool in analyzing the gas kinematics in disk galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig - vlosmod ] plots the synthetic , projected maps of ( upper panels ) the gas surface density in logarithmic scales , and ( lower panels ) the line - of - sight velocity @xmath85 for ( left ) models f10 g and ( right ) s10 g at @xmath71 . only the regions with @xmath86",
    "are shown to mimic strong radio emissions from overdense regions .",
    "the galaxy is rotating in the counterclockwise direction . in each panel ,",
    "the disk is assumed to be inclined arbitrarily by @xmath87 with respect to the plane of sky ( @xmath88-plane ) such that west of the disk is the near side .",
    "we choose @xmath89 as the position angle of the arms at @xmath90 measured from the north ( positive @xmath91-axis ) .",
    "the dotted ovals in the left panels indicate the location of the cr in model f10 g , while the solid curves in the lower panels draw the loci of @xmath92 . density and velocity data are smoothed by a gaussian beam with a width of @xmath93 . the colorbars label @xmath94 and @xmath85 in units of @xmath95 .    in the central regions at @xmath96 , the zero velocity curve runs almost parallel to the nodal line ( @xmath97-axis ) for both models .",
    "as @xmath45 increases , however , the pattern speed makes several differences in the arm morphologies and the distribution of @xmath85 that can possibly be discerned observationally .",
    "first , gaseous arms are more tightly wound in model f10 g due to a rapid change in @xmath1 than in model s10 g .",
    "second , spiral arms located outside the cr are bounded by shock fronts at the outer edges , while those inside the cr are shocked at the inner edges .",
    "consequently , the gas density in the arms is distributed asymmetrically along a radial cut such that it is larger at smaller @xmath45 outside the cr and at larger @xmath45 inside the cr , as the upper panels of figure [ fig - vlosmod ] illustrate .",
    "third , gas streaming motions associated with spiral shocks amount to @xmath98@xmath99 , which can make the gas rotate slower than the pattern even inside the cr ( see fig.[fig - phi ] ) .",
    "thus the zero velocity curve near the western ( eastern ) arm in model s10 g strongly bends downward ( upward ) , toward the opposite direction to the galaxy rotation . on the other hand ,",
    "the gas rotates faster than the pattern outside the cr , which causes the zero velocity curve to bend upward near the arms in the western parts of the disk , as in model f10 g .",
    "these differences can be used to determine whether observed segments of the arms are located inside or outside the cr .",
    "we will discuss this further in application to ngc 3627 in section [ sec : dis ] .",
    "we have presented the results of grid - based hydrodynamic simulations on spiral structures and radial mass drift in disk galaxies driven by spiral arms .",
    "the gaseous disk is assumed to be infinitesimally thin , unmagnetized , isothermal with the sound speed of @xmath59 , and initially uniform with surface density @xmath100 .",
    "for the spiral arms , we impose a rigidly - rotating logarithmic gravitational potential with pitch angle @xmath43 , strength @xmath10 , and pattern speed @xmath9 . to study the dependence of the shock structure and the mass drift rates on @xmath10 and @xmath9 , we consider three types of models in which the arm is rotating fast at @xmath51 , intermediately at @xmath47 , or slow at @xmath52 , which are referred to as the f , i , and s model , respectively .",
    "we also vary @xmath10 between 5 and 20% .",
    "the main results of this paper are summarize as follows .",
    "_ extent of spiral shocks .",
    "_  the radial extent of spiral shocks depends rather sensitively on the arm pattern speed . in the f and i models ,",
    "spiral shocks exist only up to @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively , while the outer region is almost featureless other than weak trailing waves .",
    "this is because when equation ( [ eq : t_ratio ] ) is not fulfilled , gas perturbed by one arm does not have sufficient time to adjust itself to the imposed spiral potential before encountering the next arm .",
    "that is , the rapid rotation of the potential makes itself effectively smoothed considerably along the azimuthal direction , and gas moves almost ballistically @xcite . in the s models , on the other hand ,",
    "the whole disk satisfies @xmath103 and forms spiral shocks across the entire simulation domain . in these models with a slow pattern , spiral shocks are not terminated at the cr due to epicycle motions of perturbed gas elements . since a gas element on its epicycle orbit achieves larger ( smaller ) amplitudes as it moves radially outward ( inward ) , the spiral shocks produced inside the cr are able to extend all the way to the outer radial boundary , while those originally formed outside the cr extend only slightly inward of the cr . as a consequence ,",
    "the dense arm gas outside the cr is bounded by two spiral shocks in the s models .",
    "_ relation between the pitch angle and shock strength .",
    "_  in a quasi - steady state , stronger spiral shocks tend to form at farther downstream relative to the minima of the imposed spiral potential .",
    "since @xmath1 varies systematically with @xmath45 , this makes the pitch angle @xmath104 of the gaseous arms smaller than that of the stellar arms . in our models ,",
    "the offset between @xmath104 and @xmath2 amounts to @xmath105@xmath106 , and is larger for smaller @xmath10 since a deeper potential tends to have shocks closer to its minima .",
    "it is also larger for models with larger @xmath9 due to larger radial variations of @xmath1 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : delp ] ) gives our fits to @xmath107 against the peak shock density @xmath108 of the gaseous spiral arms .",
    "_ mass drift _  the non - axisymmetric spiral potential is an efficient means of angular momentum transport , initiating radial drift of gas that would otherwise be in circular motions . in our models ,",
    "the radial mass drift is caused by a combination of three processes : angular momentum loss at spiral shocks , external gravitational torque , and self - gravitational torque .",
    "while self - gravitational torque is always negative , it is usually smaller than the other torques inside the cr . on the other hand ,",
    "the direction of the mass drift by the shock loss and external torque depends on the sign of @xmath109 , such that it is radially inward inside the cr and outward outside the cr .",
    "the resulting mass inflow rate , averaged over @xmath65 , is in the range @xmath110@xmath111 , with a larger value corresponding to stronger and/or slower arms , as described by equation ( [ eq : mtot2 ] ) .",
    "the shock loss and external spiral potential account for about 50% and 40% of the total , respectively .    \\4 . _ line - of - sight velocity _  since the spiral arms cause streaming motions in the gas flows whose amplitudes depend on the arm pattern speed , the related line - of - sight velocity @xmath85 and the density distribution across the arms can potentially provide information on the arm pattern speed . gaseous arms located outside the cr",
    "have a larger density at larger @xmath45 along a radial cut . in this case",
    ", the gas in the arms rotates faster than the pattern due to the streaming motions , tending to make the locus of @xmath92 bend in the same way as the direction of galaxy rotation .",
    "in contrast , gaseous arms located inside the cr have a larger density at smaller @xmath45 , and the @xmath92 curve near the arms bends in the opposite sense to the galaxy rotation ( see fig .  [ fig - vlosmod ] ) .",
    "our result that the radial extent of gaseous arms depends on the arm pattern speed is overall consistent with the finding of @xcite who showed using sph simulations that gaseous spirals exist up to the cr when @xmath9 is large ( @xmath112 ) , while they extend to the end of the stellar spiral arms when @xmath9 is small ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "@xcite further found that an oval ring forms , possibly by the resonance , near the olr area . a similar ring - like structure forms in the outer regions of model i10 g at late time when the outer ends of trailing gaseous arms curve back radially inward to touch the other arms ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - sigt ] ) .",
    "the main difference in the model parameters between our and their models is the pitch angle of the stellar potential . to explore the effect of @xmath2 on the position of ring - like structures that form , we have run two additional models with @xmath114 and @xmath115 , while the other parameters remain identical to model i10 g .. ] figure [ fig - res ] plots the distributions of surface density at @xmath116 from these additional runs as well as model i10 g . in each panel ,",
    "the dotted and solid circles mark the cr and olr , respectively .",
    "an oval - like structure forms in all models , although its size tends to decrease with increasing @xmath2 . model i10",
    "g with @xmath43 has an oval - like structure well outside the olr , while it is coincidentally at the olr .",
    "since the arm termination ( and thus the ring formation ) occurs at the radius where equation ( [ eq : t_ratio ] ) is satisfied , one can expect a smaller ring when @xmath2 is larger , fully consistent with our numerical results .",
    "this demonstrates that the formation of a ring - like structure near or beyond the olr is not due to the resonance .",
    "it is interesting to apply our results to the spatial extent of observed arms in the barred - spiral galaxy m83 . in this galaxy ,",
    "the spiral pattern rotates relatively rapidly at @xmath117 and has a pitch angle of @xmath118 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the rotational velocity at the flat part is @xmath119 @xcite , so that the cr is located at @xmath120 , corresponding to @xmath121 at the distance of @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "the radio data of @xcite show that the gaseous arms are weaker at the cr than at the neighboring arms , similarly to our results shown in figure [ fig - mach ] .",
    "the arms extend up to @xmath123 , while there is a plenty of gas with @xmath124 in the outer regions where the gaseous arms are absent @xcite .",
    "although the termination radius of the gaseous arms in m83 is close to the olr , it is uncertain whether the olr plays a central role in limiting the arm extent .",
    "we note that the radius of @xmath125 corresponds to @xmath12630 for the observed co velocity dispersions of @xmath127 @xcite , suggesting that the idea of arm termination by too large @xmath1 is not inconsistent with the observed gaseous arms in m83 with @xmath12810% .",
    "to measure the mass drift rate unaffected by a radial density gradient for given @xmath10 , we have employed simple disk models with radially constant @xmath129 and @xmath10 . in models with a slow patten speed , this inevitably results in readily discernable spiral shocks all the way to the outer radial boundary .",
    "in reality , however , gas surface density in spiral galaxies appears to drop off exponentially or more rapidly ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the stellar spiral potential is likely to become shallower with increasing @xmath45 beyond the cr ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although arm - to - interam density contrasts are likely unchanged by the background density ( especially when self - gravity is unimportant ) , small values of @xmath129 and @xmath10 would make it difficult to detect gaseous spiral arms at large radii in real spiral galaxies .    the tendency of spiral shocks moving toward the upstream direction with increasing @xmath45",
    "was reported by @xcite , and our results further show that the displacement of spiral shocks is larger when @xmath9 is larger .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite who found that gaseous arms are much tighter than the stellar pattern in their high-@xmath9 models .",
    "@xcite also noted that in addition to stellar and gaseous arms , there are star - forming arms traced by hiiregions , all of which may have different pitch angles such that @xmath130 if the time offset between the gaseous and star - forming arms is independent of @xmath45 .",
    "indeed , @xcite showed that the stellar arms traced by @xmath131-band observations are more loosely wound than the optical arms for a sample of five galaxies .",
    "although @xcite more recently found that the arm pitch angles in the optical band are almost identical to those in the near - ir band within observational uncertainties ( see also @xcite ) , their fitting results plotted in their figure 13 still show that the latter is larger by @xmath105 than the former for @xmath132@xmath133 , consistent with our numerical results .",
    "@xcite also reported that arm pitch angles are larger in the @xmath12-band than in the @xmath13-band .",
    "more accurate observational estimates are required to explore the dependence on @xmath9 of the offsets between arm pitch angles in different wavelength bands .    in application to the gas accretion in the milky way",
    ", @xcite used a local model of spiral shocks by considering the reaction of stellar waves back to the gaseous self - gravity and calculated the mass inflows rate due to the spiral shocks and external gravitational torque .",
    "they found that the total inflow rate is in the range @xmath134@xmath7 for @xmath135 , consistent with the extrapolation of our numerical results .",
    "they also found that the external potential is about three times more effective than the viscous torque , which is different from out finding that the effect of the spiral shocks in removing angular momentum is slightly larger than that of the external potential .",
    "this difference is presumably caused by the fact that @xcite included physical viscosity accounting for cloud collisions .",
    "this smears out the shocks and moves the peak density toward downstream ( see also @xcite ) , which tends to enhance the external torque and reduce the angular - momentum loss at the shock fronts .",
    "( solid lines ) by angular - momentum loss at spiral shocks in our models with the analytic estimate @xmath136 of @xcite ( dashed lines ) given by equation ( [ eq : hq ] ) for the ( a ) s , ( b ) , i , and ( c ) f models .",
    "note that @xmath136 agrees approximately with @xmath64 only in the s models with small @xmath10 , while it differs considerably from @xmath64 for the small-@xmath9 with large @xmath10 and all the large-@xmath9 models.[fig - hq],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    @xcite put forward a simple analytic model for angular momentum transport and related gas inflows driven by a non - axisymmetric stellar potential . by neglecting the effects of thermal pressure as well as the flow velocity relative to the potential , they considered orbit crossing of collisionless particles as a criterion for shock formation and derived the mass inflow rate @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the azimuthally - averaged gas density and @xmath139 denotes the correction factor of order unity for the degree of the orbit crossing , @xmath140 .",
    "they confirmed that equation ( [ eq : hq ] ) is in good agreement with their numerical results when bar - like stellar modes dominate the perturbations . to check whether equation ( [ eq : hq ] ) is also good for the cases dominated by a spiral potential , figure [ fig - hq ]",
    "compares @xmath136 ( dashed lines ) with @xmath64 ( solid lines ) from our numerical simulations .",
    "note that equation ( [ eq : hq ] ) can be a good approximation for the mass inflows due to the shock loss _",
    "alone _ , only for weak spiral shocks in the s models in which shock fronts are located very close to the potential minima . on the other hand ,",
    "equation ( [ eq : hq ] ) fails to describe the mass drift accurately for the slow - arm models with large @xmath10 and for the f models where spiral shocks are displaced significantly from the potential minima . in this case , the shock formation requires consideration of thermal pressure as well as incident velocities , which were neglected in @xcite .    by analyzing sloan digital sky survey dr7 data",
    ", @xcite found that about 20% of 266 galaxies with measured bar strength host dust lanes . on the other hand , numerical simulations with only a bar potential without spiral arms",
    "show that dust lanes remain strong only for @xmath141 around the time when the bar potential achieves its full strength ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that barred galaxies with strong dust lanes should be either dynamically young or supplied with fresh gas .",
    "our numerical results in this paper suggest that spiral arms can be efficient to transport gas from outside to the central region provided that the spiral arms have quite a low pattern speed so as to have a large cr radius .",
    "in addition to enhancing the mass in the central region , mass inflows by spiral arms also may help to increase the rate of star formation occurring in the nuclear ring induced by a bar potential .",
    "@xcite numerically found that without spiral arms or gas infall from halo , the star formation rate in nuclear rings decays to small values below @xmath142 after showing a strong burst that lasts only about @xmath141 .",
    "this is in contrast to the claim that star formation in nuclear rings is a long - lived phenomenon ( @xmath143@xmath144 ) , with multiple episodes ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in model s10 g , gas flows",
    "radially inward at a rate @xmath145 at @xmath90 , which would fuel star formation on the galactic center when enough mass is accumulated to undergo gravitational collapse",
    ". it would be interesting to study how much star formation is enhanced in nuclear rings by an addition of outer spiral arms , which will direct our future research .    by employing a simple isothermal equation of state ,",
    "our models produce spiral shocks with quite a large density contrast between arm and interarm regions .",
    "for instance , @xcite reported that spiral arms seen in co observations of m51 typically have an arm - to - interarm density contrast of @xmath146 , while it is @xmath147 in our models ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig - phi ] ) . even considering the beam smearing of the co data ,",
    "the density contrast in our models seems to be larger than observed values . in real galaxies , there are many physical processes including magnetic fields and star formation that can affect spiral - shock gas dynamics considerably .",
    "magnetic fields that are pervasive in the interstellar medium ( e.g. , @xcite ) can make the isothermal gas behave as if it were adiabatic with index of 2 for one - dimensional compression ( e.g. , @xcite ) , reducing the arm - peak density substantially ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "star formation and ensuing feedback occurring inside spiral arms is able to provide the arm gas with turbulent kinetic energy which not only tends to disperse dense gas but also triggers new star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . a reduced arm density may decrease the mass drift rate , while magnetic fields themselves can be a source of additional angular momentum transport via tension forces .",
    "therefore , more realistic quantitative assessment of the mass drift rate caused by spiral arms requires consideration of these processes as well as radiative heating and cooling .    finally , we discuss the distribution of gas density and @xmath85 in the arms found in our models in comparison with observations .",
    "@xcite presented a velocity map of co emission from the barred - spiral galaxy ngc 3672 , derived from gaussian fits to the line profiles .",
    "their figure 6 shows that the observed distributions of @xmath85 in the outer regions , especially the loci of @xmath92 , match those in model s10 g better than in model f10 g presented in figure [ fig - vlosmod ] , suggesting that the spiral arms in ngc 3672 are located inside the their cr .",
    "a close inspection of figure 4a of @xcite ( see also figure 1c of @xcite ) reveals that the density profiles of the gaseous arms along a radial cut have a steeper gradient at the inner edge than the outer edge , which also hints that the spiral arms rotate slow .",
    "since the cr of a strong bar is placed just outside the bar end , these all indicate that the spiral arms in ngc 3672 have a lower pattern speed than the bar .",
    "indeed , @xcite used the method of @xcite to show that the bar in ngc 3627 has a pattern speed of @xmath148 , while the southern extension of the western spiral arm has @xmath149 .",
    "the corresponding cr radii of the bar and arms are at @xmath150 and @xmath151 , respectively , indicating that the observed spiral arms in @xcite are located in between the crs of the bar and spiral arms , consistent with kinematic features in our models .",
