    "the field of strongly correlated electron systems has been one of the most active areas of materials science for decades.@xcite in particular , transition - metal oxides including high-@xmath0 cuprates@xcite and colossal magnetoresistance manganites are fascinating both from fundamental science and practical application points of view .",
    "recent experimental studies revealed that various transition - metal oxides exhibit spatial inhomogeneity in the electronic structure.@xcite for the cuprates , such inhomogeneity has been reported to have random , checkerboard or stripe - type spatial modulation.@xcite    although its origin and physical properties remain a center of debate , it is clear that spatial inhomogeneity in the cuprates greatly affects the superconducting properties.@xcite one of the most intriguing experimental observations is the positive correlation between the superconducting gap and the oxygen dopant atoms @xcite and the anticorrelation with the distance between a cu atom and an apical o atom , @xmath1 , in the scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments.@xcite based on an early mean - field study of an inhomogeneous @xmath2 model , wang _",
    "et al_.@xcite conjectured that the inhomogeneity arises from variations in the local oxygen dopant level .",
    "other papers have addressed the inhomogeneity by introducing variations in coupling constants on a phenomenological mean - field level.@xcite",
    "more recently , mori _ et al._@xcite proposed a link between the variation in pairing interactions and the position of out - of - plane oxygen atoms , that involves the covalency between the in - plane @xmath3 band and the apical @xmath4 orbitals , and the screening of the in - plane coulomb repulsion on the cu orbitals by the apical oxygen polarization . here",
    "we study this problem in a microscopic model with inhomogeneity in the electronic structure using a non - perturbative approach that goes beyond a static mean - field treatment .",
    "in particular , we investigate the effect of spatial inhomogeneity in the electronic structure on the superconducting ( sc ) properties of a hubbard model using cellular dynamical mean - field theory ( cdmft).@xcite motivated by the result in wang _",
    "_ @xcite and mori _ et al . _",
    "@xcite where out - of plane dopant atoms affect the in - plane hole density , we consider a two - dimensional hubbard model with planar density modulations .",
    "we find that the @xmath5-wave gap amplitude is significantly increased in regions with increased hole density , if they are surrounded by regions with smaller hole density .",
    "the spatial modulation of the gap is found to become as large as a factor 2 and goes well beyond the variation one would expect from the difference in hole density .",
    "the sc order parameter also shows similar variation .",
    "the enhanced @xmath5-wave gap in the overdoped region is consistent with the experimental reports if the main effect of oxygen atoms is to locally increase the hole concentration.@xcite",
    "we consider a two - dimensional ( 2d ) hubbard model for the cu @xmath5 electrons : @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the annihilation operator of an electron with spin @xmath8 at site @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 the nearest - neighbor transfer integral , and @xmath12 the on - site repulsive coulomb interaction . here ,",
    "only the nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath11 is included .",

    "we consider two types of potential modulations as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] . a checkerboard - type variation in the local potential where @xmath13 alternates between @xmath14 and @xmath15 on 2@xmath162 plaquettes and a stripe - like variation in which the modulation is unidirectional .",

    "the cdmft maps the bulk lattice onto a cluster embedded in a dynamic mean - field that describes the rest of the system and is determined self - consistently . here",
    ", we use a small 2@xmath162 cluster .",
    "this approximation may be justified in the strong - coupling @xmath19 limit , in which the coherence length becomes sufficiently small so that the superconducting behavior is well approximated on a 2@xmath162 plaquette .",
    "in addition , the small cluster size allows us to solve the effective cluster problem using the lanczos exact diagonalization ( ed ) technique @xcite to directly access dynamical quantities such as the density of states without additional analytic continuation .    for the inhomogeneous system , we map the lattice onto a number @xmath20 of in - equivalent 2@xmath162 clusters , indicated by the bold lines in fig .

    "the self - energy depends on the cluster index @xmath22 and the intracluster coordinates @xmath23 .",
    "this means that dynamic correlations are retained within a cluster , but neglected between the clusters.@xcite the clusters are then linked by the self - consistency condition .",
    "this approach can be regarded as a cluster extension to the dmft study of stripes in ref .  .",
    "the choice of clusters may not be unique .",
    "for example , one may take clusters comprised of two sites of the @xmath18 region and two sites of the @xmath15 region .",
    "however , in this case , the local symmetry inside the cluster is severely broken .",
    "we expect this to give rise to a strong suppression of @xmath5-wave pairing inside the cluster .",
    "hence this choice would not allow us to explore the physics we set out to explore , such as the modulation of a local pairing gap through the proximity to a region with different doping .    with our choice of clusters ,",

    "we also introduced two parameters representing the superconducting correlations for bath @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",

    "the tetragonal symmetry is broken and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are independent parameters . even in this case , the difference between @xmath33 and @xmath35 was found to be very small .    the self - consistency condition of the ed cdmft is closed using the conjugate gradient minimization algorithm with a distance function defined on an imaginary frequency axis with the effective inverse temperature @xmath36 , and short cut - off frequency @xmath37.@xcite we set the coulomb repulsion to @xmath38 and note that our results are insensitive to this choice as long as @xmath12 is sufficiently large .",
    "potential modulation @xmath39 will be at most on the order of @xmath11 , and hubbard bands do not overlap with the low - energy quasiparticle part .",
    "therefore , the effect of the short cut - off frequency is expected to be small .     as a function of carrier density @xmath40 for the 2d hubbard model computed by cdmft with the ed impurity solver at @xmath41 .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this enhancement of superconductivity is similar to that observed in our previous study of superlattices made up of underdoped and overdoped hubbard layers.@xcite there we argued that the enhancement in the overdoped layers was due to their proximity to the larger pairing scale in the underdoped layers .",
    "the similarity between the two results and the nature of approximation lead us to speculate that the origin of the increased order parameter in the present study has similar origin .    to support this conjecture , we plot the results for the system with the stripe - like modulation in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : psied ] .",
    "the corresponding numerical data are listed in table  [ tab : stripe ] . here , we plot both @xmath59 and @xmath60 . however , the difference between them is at most @xmath61 and therefore the corresponding points are almost indistinguishable ( see also table  [ tab : stripe ] ) . as in the checkerboard case ,",
    "the order parameter is enhanced in the cluster with larger hole doping .",
    "however , it is clear that the enhancement is significantly weaker than in the former case with checkerboard - type potential . for the checkerboard modulation",
    ", the maximum @xmath46 is about 30 % larger than the maximum value in the uniform system , while in the striped case the enhancement is about 10 % .",
    "we believe that this difference comes from the fact that , for the checkerboard modulation , the hole - rich cluster is fully surrounded by hole - poor clusters , which have a larger pairing scale.@xcite on the other hand , in the striped case , the hole - rich cluster is in proximity to only two hole - poor clusters and also two hole - rich clusters , which reduces the effect . in both cases , @xmath46 in the hole - poor clusters is decreased significantly by the coupling with the hole - rich clusters . the reduction is stronger in the stripe - type potential .",
    "this fact may partly be explained by the breaking of the local tetragonal symmetry .",
    "these results suggest that the sc order parameter is quite sensitive to the local environment .",
    "it is also interesting to discuss the dependence of the order parameters in the hole - rich , @xmath62 , and hole - poor regions , @xmath63 , with increasing potential @xmath39 , or equivalently , decreasing filling @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively . with increasing @xmath39 and decreasing @xmath55",
    ", @xmath62 follows the same trend as the order parameter in the homogeneous system , i.e. , it first increases , then decreases with decreasing @xmath55 .",
    "it is enhanced over the order parameter in the uniform system through the proximity of the hole - rich region to the larger pairing scale in the hole - poor region .",
    "an optimal value of @xmath39 that maximizes @xmath62 results from a delicate balance between the proximity of the larger pairing scale from the hole - poor regions , and the reduction in the pairing scale with increasing doping in its own hole - rich region .",
    "the order parameter @xmath63 in the hole - poor region , in contrast , decreases monotonically with decreasing filling @xmath64 .",
    "this may be explained by a strong reduction in the pairing interaction in the hole - poor region by its coupling to the smaller pairing scale in the hole - rich regions .",
    "it would be interesting to determine whether the enhancement of pairing we find in the hole - rich regions , translates to an increase in @xmath0 .",
    "our zero temperature and small cluster calculations , however , do not allow us to speculate on this question .",

    "we calculated the @xmath67-space average of the momentum - dependent lattice green s function to obtain the local green s function , and the local dos is given as its imaginary part .",
    "the lattice green s function has the same form as that used to close the self - consistency condition for the cdmft but with the self - energy as a function of real frequency .",
    "when computing the self - energy , we introduced a small imaginary number @xmath68 on the order of @xmath69 to the real frequency .",
    "we confirmed that different choices of @xmath68 give similar results .",

    "we stress here that this result is robust against the choice of broadening parameter @xmath68 .    from figs .",
    "[ fig : dos ] and [ fig : gap ] , we also notice that the effect of a potential modulation on the gap amplitude in the underdoped region is weaker than that on @xmath46 ; @xmath70 is reduced less than @xmath46 when the potential modulation exists .",

    "we emphasize that the enhancement of the @xmath5-wave gap in the hole - rich region relative to that in the hole - poor region is quite striking and opposite to the behavior in the uniform system .",

    "et al._,@xcite our observation that the region with larger hole density ( smaller filling @xmath40 ) has a larger gap is consistent with the experimental reports .    estimating potential modulation from experimental data is not easy because it requires precise position of charged ( dopant ) ions and the electron - density modulation .",
    "but , taking the experimental uncertainty of ref . , density modulation is expected to be less than 10  % . in our calculations , the potential modulation @xmath77 is enough to induce such a small density modulation .",
    "this @xmath39 ( @xmath78  ev ) is smaller than the one simply estimated by assuming point dopant - charged ions .",
    "for example , in la@xmath79sr@xmath80cuo@xmath81 , potential modulation due to the a - site dopant ions becomes of order of 12  ev with the in - plane lattice constant 4   and the dielectric constant @xmath82.@xcite in reality , other effects such as the screening due to the other conduction electrons reduce the modulation .",
    "therefore , our potential modulation must be regarded as the self - consistently determined one by including screening effects , and @xmath83 seems to be in the realistic range",
    ". we would like to emphasize that our results show that even a very weak density modulation , on the order of 5  % and therefore well within the experimental uncertainty , is enough to result in a significant , i.e. , factor 2 , variation in the local gap amplitude .",
    "however , the variation in the gap magnitude we observe of about a factor of two is less than the factor 3 that has been reported in refs .  , and .",
    "certainly , a single - band hubbard model is too simple to fully resolve this issue , and additional degrees of freedom could play an important role , such as the apical oxygen as proposed in ref .  .",
    "one possible scenario to resolve the present discrepancy is the screening effect by the oxygen ions .",
    "this reduces the on - site coulomb interaction , resulting in a further enhancement of the superconducting order parameter @xmath46 and the @xmath5-wave gap within the strong - coupling regime.@xcite    as reported in the stm measurements in ref .",
    ", both the average gap amplitude and the width and asymmetry of the distribution of gap magnitudes increase as the doping decreases , with long tails on the large gap side of the distribution . assuming that the observed inhomogeneity is related to a carrier - density modulation",
    ", our study can provide a possible explanation . based on our results",
    ", we can speculate that the large gap tail in the underdoped samples originates from hole - rich islands with large gaps residing in the hole - poor environment .",
    "the strong asymmetry is naturally expected because the volume fraction of the large - gap hole - rich regions is small because of the small average hole concentration .",
    "recently , parker and coworkers@xcite studied the gap - amplitude modulation in the over - doped cuprates bi@xmath84sr@xmath84cacu@xmath84o@xmath85 as a function of temperature .",
    "it was revealed that medium - sized gap regions surrounded by large - gap regions persist to higher temperatures than regions with similar gap sizes in the proximity of small - gap regions .",
    "we speculate that both the large - gap and medium - gap regions are over - doped and the former is closer to the optimal doping .",
    "thus , the proximity effect is weaker compared with that between under - doped regions and over - doped regions as we studied in this paper . to confirm this conjecture ,",
    "it is necessary to make a link between the gap amplitude and the local carrier density .",
    "it is also desirable to perform the similar experimental analysis using the under - doped and near - optimally - doped cuprates .    to summarize",
    ", we have studied the superconducting properties of an inhomogeneous two - dimensional hubbard model for the high-@xmath0 cuprates with modulations in the electronic hole density using a cellular dynamical mean - field approximation .",
    "we have found that the modulation in hole density results in a considerable spatial variation in the superconducting order parameter which is quite sensitive to the local environment . in particular , the order parameter in the hole - rich regions is significantly enhanced over the order parameter in a corresponding uniform system , if the hole - rich region is embedded in a region with smaller hole - density .",
    "furthermore , we have found that the @xmath5-wave gap amplitude in the density of states shows similar modulation , with an enhanced gap in the hole - rich regions .",
