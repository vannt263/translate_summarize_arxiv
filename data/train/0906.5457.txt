    "they analyzed their measurements using the bloch equation and concluded that the reversal process was governed by the nucleation and growth of domains in the applied field .",
    "laser assisted magnetization processes have considerable potential for future ultra - high density recording systems . essentially , the path to higher densities requires continuous reduction in the grain volume @xmath1 of the storage medium , necessitating an increase in the magneto - crystalline anisotropy energy density @xmath2 in order to preserve a sufficiently large value of the parameter @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) to ensure thermal stability of written information @xcite .",
    "however , the large value of @xmath2 impacts the writability of the information , and some scheme is required to overcome this problem .",
    "a promising solution is hybrid or heat assisted magnetic recording ( hamr ) @xcite in which the medium is heated in order to lower the anisotropy and thereby allow information to be written to the medium . since this is a relatively new field",
    "the magnetization reversal mechanisms are not well understood .",

    "the film was especially designed to have a low curie temperature in order to simplify the experiments .",
    "we compare the results with a computational model using the landau - lifshitz - bloch ( llb ) equation @xcite , which is ideally suited to simulation of magnetization processes up to and beyond @xmath5 and has been shown @xcite to give an excellent description of the physics of pulsed laser processes .",
    "it is concluded that the magnetization response consists of a fast demagnetization followed by a slower response in which the magnetization evolves into the field direction by a process of thermally activated transitions over the local energy barriers .",
    "our llb - micromagnetic model is shown to give a good description of the physics of the reversal process on both timescales .",
    "the experiment is a stroboscopic pump - probe experiment using a strong laser pulse to initiate a change in the magnetic state of the sample and a weak probe pulse to observe the resulting magnetization dynamics via the moke .",
    "the sample is mounted in a spin - stand which first moves the magnetic film through a reset field of magnitude @xmath6 t for a duration of @xmath7 ms which ensures that the sample is in a remanent state before exposure to each laser pulse .",

    "we note that the field applied is always lower than the static coercivity of the sample as measured at room temperature by a vibrating sample magnetometer . at the center of the pole piece a small hole allows optical access to the sample at which point the sample",
    "is exposed to the pump - pulse .",
    "the laser pulses arrive at a rate of 1 khz but the rotation of the spin - stand ( about 7,000 rpm ) ensures that freshly saturated film arrives between pulses .",
    "the stroboscopic experiment uses a libra laser system ( made by coherent ) which can produce a 1 khz stream of 1 mj , 150 fs pulses of 800 nm radiation .",
    "this beam is attenuated , the probe beam is split off and frequency doubled to 400 nm .",
    "the pump beam is routed around an optical delay line with 17 fs resolution over a 1 ns range and then focused at normal incidence to a spot approximately 800 @xmath9 m in diameter on the disk surface .",
    "the probe beam is polarized and then brought to a 400 @xmath9 m focal spot , centered on the pump beam with a power level of about 1/20th of the pump . because the probe is only half the diameter of the pump it must be noted that there will be a temperature distribution across the region probed .",
    "the probe approaches the sample surface at near normal incidence ; this polar moke geometry yields sensitivity to the out - of - plane component of magnetization .",
    "the reflected probe beam is directed into an optical bridge detector which uses a wollaston prism to split the beam into two orthogonal polarized components which impinge on a two segment photo - detector . by rotating the detector to the angle where the output of the two polarization channels ( a & b ) are approximately equal",
    ", then the difference between them ( a - b ) is sensitive to small changes of the polarization angle of the reflected probe which in turn is proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "the sum ( a+b ) is sensitive to changes in reflectivity @xmath11 , which is associated with temperature changes and stress waves due to processes such as lattice expansions . in order to improve immunity to laser drift",
    "the pump beam was chopped and lock - in amplifiers used to detect the sum and difference signals .",
    "this makes the measurement sensitive to the difference between the state of the sample without the pump pulse applied and the state induced by the pump - pulse .",
    "therefore the measurements are relative and it is difficult to assign an absolute scale to the magnetization changes .",
    "for characterization of the sample the quasi - static hysteresis loop was measured .",
    "of particular importance is the coercivity , which on this timescale is @xmath12 0.85 t , and the saturation magnetization @xmath13 , which is equal to 0.35 @xmath14 a / m .",
    "the coercivity of course is already greater than the field applied during our pulsed field experiment .",
    "however , it is important to note that the dynamic coercivity on the timescale of the pulsed laser experiment is even larger .",

    "[ f : fig2 ] ( a ) is a probe of the electron / lattice temperature in the system .",
    "it indicates that the same temperature profile is generated each time and that the temperature scales linearly with pulse energy .",
    "the reflectivity measurement has three distinct features . within",
    "the first 5 ps is a large peak having a width of 350 fs , which corresponds to the large rise in electron temperature caused by the arrival of the 150 fs laser pulse .",
    "the electron system then establishes thermal equilibrium with the lattice which creates the second , rather broader , peak 20 ps later . in reality",
    "the peak temperature the lattice reaches is much lower than that for the electrons ; however , it seems that in this sample the change in reflectivity is more sensitive to the lattice temperature than the electron temperature .",
    "the waves seen superimposed onto the lattice temperature peak during the 3 - 35 ps time frame are probably stress pulses launched into the film by the laser heating of the surface , which reflect off the interface with the glass substrate .",
    "the time between peaks is 12 ps , which , given the film and interlayer thickness of 25 nm , suggests a propagation speed of 4,100 m / s ; consistent with the speed of sound in a typical metal .",
    "the sample appears to cool rather slowly as the lattice temperature has only fallen to half its peak value after 1 ns .",
    "this reflects the fact that in this film there is no heat sink to absorb the heat . fig .",
    "[ f : fig2 ] ( b ) and ( c ) show the magnetization dynamics in applied fields of 0 and -0.52 t respectively . fig .",
    "[ f : fig2 ] ( c ) clearly demonstrates heat assisted reversal due to the pulse . for pulse energies above @xmath18j the sample",
    "is seen to cool with the magnetization aligning along the applied field .",
    "recalling that the dynamic coercivity estimated from magnetic measurements is around 1.46 t , this demonstrates a significant heat - assistance during the sub - nanosecond reversal process .",
    "we now consider in detail the processes involved in the magnetization dynamics , which involves three characteristic timescales as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : fig2 ] .",
    "the initial phase involves a rapid demagnetization of the sample lagging the change in reflectivity by only 50 fs . the demagnetization takes about 500 fs , independent of the applied field .",
    "this is consistent with the normal expectation of a rapid demagnetization as previously demonstrated experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "the sample then appears to partially recover its magnetization in the original direction , on a timescale independent of the applied field .",
    "it is interesting to note that the rate of recovery from the demagnetization peak is related to the amount of demagnetization achieved - a pattern consistent with the calculations of kazantseva _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . throughout the whole process",
    "the only apparent field dependence occurs in the longer time - scale dynamics ( 20ps-1ns ) . over this timescale , for the higher laser powers ,",
    "a gradual reversal of the magnetization is seen .    a similar systematic trend is also exhibited by the temporal variation of @xmath19 at constant laser power in various applied fields , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : fig3 ] .",
    "the initial disappearance and recovery of the magnetization is similar for all applied fields , but with increasing positive field the long - term trend is clearly toward positive magnetization .",
    "the form of the dynamics , involving a trend against the field direction followed by a slow reversal into the field direction is apparently somewhat counter - intuitive .",
    "however , the form of the magnetization evolution can be explained by consideration of the different timescales associated with processes at the atomic and macrospin length scales . within each grain or",
    "macrospin the disappearance and recovery of the magnetization will be governed by the longitudinal relaxation time , which is temperature dependent but typically of a sub - picosecond timescale , which is consistent with the experimental data of fig .",
    "[ f : fig2 ] ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "however , after this process the system remains at an elevated temperature for around 1ns , so there is a possibility of thermally activated magnetization reversal .",
    "this will have a characteristic timescale determined by the macrospin energy barrier , which is lowered by the reduction of the anisotropy constant at elevated temperature , but typically has values much greater than 1ps .",
    "on this basis we would expect to see a fast reduction and recovery of the magnetization due to atomic processes on the picosecond timescale with a slower relaxation into the field direction due to thermally activated reversal of the macrospins . in order to test this hypothesis in relation to the experimental results",
    "we have developed a computational model of the laser heating process based on the llb equation which has been shown @xcite to give a good description of magnetization processes over both characteristic timescales .",

    "the initial recovery is followed by a slow reversal of the magnetization toward the field direction which , in the model , can be unambiguously attributed to thermally activated transitions over the particle energy barriers , supporting the earlier interpretation of the experimental data .",
    "[ f : fig8 ] explores the effect of increasing the peak electron temperature . as might be expected , the effect of this parameter is to lead to a more complete demagnetization during the laser pulse .",

    "although the model reproduces the essential physics of the reversal process , particularly the different behavior on the timescales of longitudinal relaxation ( fast demagnetization ) and transverse relaxation ( super - paramagnetic fluctuations ) qualitative agreement only is obtained with experimental data .",

    "it is necessary to include an important experimental factor ; specifically the fact that the probe pulse area is comparable to that of the pump .",

    "the diameter of the spot used in the model calculations is much smaller than in the experiments ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "this would be an unrealistic approximation if the magnetization reversal involved domain wall processes ; however , since the grains are essentially decoupled in the experimental films this simplified model is able to gives some insight into the effects of the temperature profile .",

    "@xcite , changes in the value of the damping constant affect the amount of energy the magnetic system absorbs from the initial heat pulse and so how much of a demagnetization is achieved for a given peak electron temperature .",

    "firstly , some of the grains take on a negative sense of the magnetization on recovery .",
    "others will recover in a positive sense but at an angle greater than the energy maximum as the anisotropy increases ; these grains are most likely to switch into the negative direction as the temperature decreases . at longer timescale , and consequently",
    "lower temperatures , the in - plane component reduces as the magnetization of each grain begins to lie preferentially along the easy anisotropy axis .",
    "however , the in - plane component does not completely disappear , probably reflecting the boltzmann distribution of the magnetization direction within each grain .",
    "in addition to these mechanisms it is also likely that there will be thermally activated reversal over the energy barriers at the elevated temperatures . along with the increase in spontaneous magnetization",
    "as the film cools this would contribute to the gradual increase in @xmath19 over timescales of 1 ns .",
    "we have presented laser pump - probe measurements which show a clear heat assistance from the laser pulse for switching the magnetization state . this is demonstrated by the ability to switch in an externally applied field with a magnitude lower than the intrinsic coercivity .",
    "the experiments show a rapid demagnetization and recovery followed by a slow evolution of the magnetization into the field direction .",
    "this is consistent with the existence of two characteristic relaxation times ; the longitudinal and transverse relaxation times .",
    "the former is atomic - scale processes and is typically of the sub - picosecond order , whereas the transverse relaxation time reflects transitions over the energy barrier and can be orders of magnitude longer . in order to investigate the reversal mechanism we have developed a micromagnetic model based on the llb equation which naturally includes both timescales .",
    "the llb model calculations are in good quantitative agreement with the experimental data , as long as the the temperature gradient across the probe pulse is included .",

    "there is a partial recovery of @xmath10 in the original direction as @xmath13 starts to recover .",

    "may also be assisted by thermally activated switching caused by the elevated lattice temperature .",
    "the elevated temperature has the effect of lowering the anisotropy energy barriers ( due to the reduced values of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ) and also provides the thermal energy to induce the transitions .",
