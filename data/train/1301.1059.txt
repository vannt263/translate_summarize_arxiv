    "this paper is concerned with the bianchi groups , i.e. the class of groups defined by psl@xmath0 of the integers of an imaginary quadratic number field @xmath3 $ ] where @xmath4 is a product of different primes .",
    "any such group is a group of orientation - preserving isometries of hyperbolic three space @xmath5 by means of the right - coset identification @xmath6 .",
    "we aim at computing the left hand side of the baum - connes - conjecture for these groups .",
    "our main result is theorem [ statement ] that accomplishes the calculation in the example case @xmath7 .",
    "+ there is vast literature on the bianchi groups @xcite and the conjecture @xcite .",
    "the latter is concerned with the difficult problem to parametrize k - theory classes of projective modules over the reduced @xmath2-algebra of @xmath1 .",
    "this @xmath2-algebra is defined as the closure in the operator norm of the left regular representation of @xmath1 on @xmath8 .",
    "the conjecture asserts that the k - theory of @xmath9 is isomorphic to equivariant k - homology with @xmath1-compact supports .",
    "we shall use the `` official '' definition @xmath10 of equivariant k - theory with @xmath1-compact supports as in @xcite , where @xmath11 is a classifying space for proper actions of @xmath1 , and @xmath12 is equivariant bivariant k - theory as defined in @xcite . in the present context of a closed subgroup @xmath1 of a semisimple lie group @xmath13 , the symmetric space",
    "@xmath14 is a typical universal space @xmath11 @xcite , where @xmath15 is a maximal compact subgroup of @xmath13 .",
    "+ the baum - connes conjecture applies equally to lie groups and has , in fact , been proved for all connected lie groups @xcite .",
    "however , most often the plancherel formula allows to understand the structure of the left regular representation of lie groups , whereas the @xmath2-algebras of arithmetic groups have turned out to be very hard to understand .",
    "one of the reasons is that for many arithmetic groups , the @xmath2-algebra is not type i , i.e. there are irreducible representations not contained in the operator ideal of compact operators",
    ". + hence , the knowledge of the k - theory of the @xmath2-algebra yields valuable information which seems not to be accessible by more elementary or more explicit approaches .",
    "furthermore , the baum - connes conjecture is , so far , the method of choice for computing the k - theory whenever the structure of the @xmath2-algebra is unknown .",
    "+ however , it often turns out that the left - hand side is not immediately calculable either .",
    "the present paper is in spirit quite close to @xcite which computes the left - hand - side for the group @xmath16 ; however , it is unknown if the assembly map is surjective in this case .",
    "in contrast , julg and kasparov have verified the baum - connes conjecture for all discrete subgroups of @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite . since @xmath19",
    ", this readily implies that the assembly map is an isomorphism for all bianchi groups .",
    "therefore , the bianchi groups are arguably the most interesting arithmetic groups for which complete knowledge of ( the isomorphism type of ) @xmath20 is available .",
    "+ the canonical way to understand arithmetic groups is via actions on retracts of the symmetric space , as computed by reduction theory . here",
    ", we shall use ( a suitable subset of ) flge s cw - complex @xcite , a union of a 2-dimensional retract of hyperbolic 3-space with a countable subset of the satake ( spherical ) boundary of @xmath5 .",
    "these boundary points of the complex are the @xmath1-orbits of so - called singular vertices of the flge complex , and such orbits are in bijection with the non - trivial elements of the class group @xcite .",
    "the singular points are clearly visible in the visualizations of several exemplary fundamental domains in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "contractibility of the flge complex has been shown by rahm and the author in @xcite .",
    "+ the equivariant @xmath15-homology of bianchi groups has been calculated by rahm in @xcite .",
    "however , he considers only the cases of trivial class number @xmath21 .",
    "the reason for this restriction is that in these cases there are no singular points .",
    "however , for higher class numbers the flge complex is not proper anymore , as the stabilizers of the singular points are parabolic .",
    "an algorithmic approach for computation of the complex has been introduced , described and exploited for the computation of the integral homology by a.  rahm and the author in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a program for the calculation of fundamental domains in the pari / gp language has been published as part of rahm s phd thesis @xcite .",
    "+ since the presence of singular points in the flge complex leads to the action being non - proper , in these cases the flge complex is not a model for the universal classifying space @xmath11 of proper actions , and therefore not immediately suitable for calculation of equivariant @xmath15-homology for higher class numbers . moreover , the flge complex is not locally finite since there are infinitely many edges emanating from the singular points .",
    "so , there is no obvious locally compact topology on it , leading to severe difficulties in defining an associated commutative @xmath2-algebra .",
    "+ there is a general construction for turning arbitrary , possibly non - proper , @xmath1-cw - complexes into proper actions @xcite which could in principle be applied to the flge complex ; however , the construction is not in general cofinite and therefore difficult to use for computational purposes .",
    "+ in the present paper , we show how to overcome these difficulties .",
    "the approach pursued in this paper is more akin of classical @xmath2-algebraic techniques , and hence closer to the original object under study , the @xmath2-algebra @xmath9 .",
    "the four main ingredients are : reduction theory in the form of the flge complex , the existence of the borel - serre compactification , a certain amount of kasparov theory , and topology in the form of an atiyah - hirzebruch spectral sequence .",
    "+ let us give a short summary of the steps and results .",
    "section [ fl ] introduces the topological objects under study .",
    "we identify the universal cover of the borel - serre compactification of the locally symmetric space associated to @xmath1 as a universal @xmath1-space ( lemma [ isup ] ) .",
    "one may note that for torsion - free subgroups of bianchi groups , borel - serre compactifications of the quotient @xmath22 ( which is then a manifold ) have already been mentioned in @xcite .",
    "there is an extension [ 55 ] of @xmath2-algebras naturally associated to the inclusion of the boundary component into this universal space .",
    "we use this to show that the equivariant @xmath15-homology of @xmath1 forms a 6-term exact sequence ( sequence [ hy2lhs ] ) with topological @xmath15-homology of a disjoint sum of tori and the kasparov k - homology of the crossed product @xmath23 .",
    "the latter , in turn , is determined ( lemma [ iszero ] ) by the k - homology of the subset @xmath24 of the flge complex @xmath25 .",
    "it is necessary to work with @xmath26 instead of @xmath25 in order to overcome the problem that @xmath25 is not locally finite .",
    "the space @xmath26 is naturally endowed with a locally compact topology , so there is no problem in associating a well - behaved commutative @xmath2-algebra to it .",
    "the goal of section [ ahs ] is to introduce the spectral sequence used to compute the k - homology of @xmath26 . in principle , the atiyah - hirzebruch spectral sequence starting from bredon homology associated to a group action on a complex is the classical tool to compute its equivariant k - homology .",
    "that spectral sequence is explained in @xcite and was used in @xcite .",
    "here , we have to consider a slightly more general form of the spectral sequence ( lemma [ bigone ] ) in order to be able to treat the space @xmath26 instead of @xmath25 .",
    "this generalization is done by identifying the atiyah - hirzebruch spectral sequence for the equivariant k - homology of a complex as the schochet spectral sequence associated to a filtration by closed ideals of a @xmath2-algebra . in this case , these ideals come from the intersections of the skeleta of @xmath25 with @xmath5 . at that point ,",
    "all technical difficulties are resolved , and we can illustrate the computation by means of the concrete example @xmath7 in section [ concrete ] .",
    "this leads to the main theorem [ statement ] . +",
    "the bianchi groups , although far from being amenable , are k - amenable @xcite , as they are closed subgroups of a k - amenable group , see @xcite for the proof for @xmath27 . as a consequence",
    ", there is a kk - equivalence between the reduced and full group @xmath2-algebra .",
    "therefore , by calculating the k - theory of the former we simultaneously calculate that of the latter . hence , the bianchi groups may also be the most interesting lattices for which complete knowledge of the k - theory of the full algebra is now available .",
