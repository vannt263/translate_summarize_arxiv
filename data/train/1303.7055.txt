    "recently a standard model ( sm ) higgs - like particle with a mass of @xmath0 gev was discovered @xcite . in the paradigm of the weak scale supersymmetry ( susy ) which aims at the naturalness of the electro - weak scale",
    ", however , such a higgs mass brings in tensions , especially the minimal susy sm ( mssm ) .",
    "nonminimal and still natural scenarios of susy are thus motivated .",
    "one of them is the mssm with a vector - like generation @xcite .",
    "it gives the right higgs mass naturally , is consistent with precision electroweak measurements , and has a rich phenomenology @xcite . in the framework of susy , vector - like fermions",
    "can also be motivated by other theories beyond sm , such as susy extension with extra - dimensions or with composite states @xcite .",
    "so it is worth asking the question whether such a scenario also provides explanations to other problems such as neutrino masses .",
    "neutrino oscillations are the undoubted new physics beyond the sm .",
    "daya bay @xcite and reno @xcite experiments recently discovered a relatively large @xmath1 . within the framework of susy , in the absence of r - parity conservation , neutrino masses and mixings",
    "can be generated from lepton number violating ( lpv ) couplings @xcite .",
    "this approach was extensively studied before @xcite .",
    "it is known that all the neutrino experimental results , including that of oscillation phenomena like the large atmospheric mixing angle @xmath2 , the hierarchy of oscillation frequencies @xmath3 and the smallness of @xmath4 , can be understood in three generation lpv mssm . however",
    ", this needs some special requirements for relevant coupling constants and mass parameters .    combining both considerations above",
    ", we will work in the lpv mssm with a vector - like extra generation @xcite .",
    "while this model takes the vector - like slepton doublets as the two higgs doublets needed for the electroweak symmetry breaking , the sm - like higgs mass can be naturaly 125 gev @xcite .",
    "extra trilinear lpv couplings between ordinary fermions and vector - like fermions provide a much larger parameter space to explain neutrino pheomena right .    in this paper , phenomenological aspects of the model will be analyzed . in sect .",
    "ii , we make a brief review of the model . in sect .",
    "iii , neutrino masses are calculated . for the neutrino physics , noting the enlarged parameter space , we consider trilinear lpv couplings carefully .",
    "one - loop contribution to neutrino masses due to new trilinear lpv couplings is calculated , theoretical analysis are performed and numerical results are shown in detail . besides , we analyze the sm - like higgs mass and explicitly show that it can be increased to 125 gev by two new yukawa couplings of the up - type higgs with vector - like quarks in sect .",
    "the lhc phenomenology of the new fermions is analyzed in sect .",
    "the summary and discussions are given in the last section .",
    "this model@xcite is susy and sm gauge invariant , and r - parity violation with baryon number conservation is assumed . for the matter",
    "content , in addition to the ordinary 3 generations ( 3 g ) , a vector - like generation is introduced in . without r - parity conservation ,",
    "this can be also thought as that there are @xmath5 chiral generations , where 4 stands for four chiral generations with sm quantum numbers and 1 for another chiral generation with opposite quantum numbers .",
    "the 4 chiral generations with same quantum numbers mix .",
    "the 1 has dirac masses with only one combination of the 4 , thus , there are always sm required three massless chiral generations and one massive vector - like generation .    in terms of mass eigenstates ( before electroweak symmetry breaking ) , the massive sleptons in the vector - like generation are taken as the two higgs doublets .",
    "new particles beyond the mssm are the following with quantum numbers under su(3)@xmath6su(2)@xmath7u(1)@xmath8 , @xmath9 u_4^c(\\bar{3 } , 1 , -\\frac{4}{3})~,~ u_h^c(3 , 1 , \\frac{4}{3})~,~ d_4^c(\\bar{3 } , 1 , \\frac{2}{3})~,~ d_h^c(3 , 1,-\\frac{2}{3})~. \\end{array } \\nonumber\\ ] ] the superpotential is conveniently written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 stand for that with lepton number conservation and lpv , respectively , @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , i=1 - 3 , are the first three generation @xmath20 doublet leptons , doublet quarks , singlet charged leptons , singlet down - type quarks and singlet up - type quarks , respectively . @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the up - type and down - type higgs . note that the term @xmath23 in @xmath24 was missed in ref .",
    "@xcite . and in @xmath12 interactions of purely singlets are omitted , which are irrelevant to our study .    by assuming universality of the mass - squared terms , the alignment of the @xmath25 terms the soft mass terms and the trilinear soft terms of all fermion s superpartners in the model are @xmath26    proper values of the new @xmath27 terms are set to avoid unwanted color symmetry and purely @xmath28 symmetry breaking ,",
    "( 11 , 12 ) in paper @xcite , therefore ewsb in our model is just the same as in mssm .",
    "after ewsb , the specific fermion mass matrixes and sfermion mass - squared matrixes are given in appendix a.",
    "lpv results in nonvanishing neutrino masses . in this model ,",
    "in addition to traditional r - parity violation in the mssm , a lot more bilinear and trilinear lpv interactions are brought in through the vector - like generation . in this work",
    ", the trilinear r - parity violating interactions will be studied . to avoid complication due to",
    "too many lpv sources , sneutrino vevs will not be considered .",
    "there are several reasons for this.first , we can phenomenologically assume the universality of the soft susy breaking mass terms at the weak scale , to avoid dangerously large flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) , without considering any uv completion of the model .",
    "in that case , because of the alighnment in bilinear terms of the superpotential and that of soft terms , r - parity violating bilinear terms can be rotated away via field redefinition , and sneutrino vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) vanish in the physical basis .",
    "the second reason is from consideration of underlying models .",
    "susy breaking is introduced effectively in our model , it can result from gauge mediated susy breaking",
    ". then the messenger scale can be as low as 100 tev , even if the universality scale is at the susy breaking messenger scale , the running effect is small , and the bilinear lpv is not important compared to the trilinear ones .",
    "finally , small sneutrino vevs can be included in the analysis nevertheless in future works , after the role of new trilinear lpv interactions gets a thorough understanding .",
    "the trilinear lpv lagrangian relevant to neutrino masses is from @xmath12 , @xmath29 where @xmath30 stands for the left - hand neutrino .",
    "the 7 types of trilinear lpv interactions in the above equation induce 14 types of one - loop diagrams contributing to the neutrino spectrum , which are proportional to @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "the feynman diagrams and the corresponding analytical results are shown in fig . 1 in appendix b. for simplicity and without losing our purpose , in the yukawa interactions of @xmath36 we assume that only @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 are nonvanishing , that is vector - like particles have yukawa interactions only with the third generation .",
    "thus , the vector - like generation has little constraints from the collider phenomenology .    before starting to analyze the neutrino mass spectrum ,",
    "some assumptions are introduced in order to control the parameter space and get relatively simple analytical result .",
    "since four new up - type higgs yukawa couplings @xmath43 and five new down - type higgs yukawa couplings @xmath44 appear in our model , and among which @xmath45 provide the mass mixings between vector - like generations , and further more , they have infrared quasi - fixed point @xcite , so we assume @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we also set @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "in other words , we neglect all new down - type higgs yukawa couplings in quark sectors while consider all of the new up - type higgs yukawa couplings only and take @xmath51 , which is a reasonable assumption .    basing on the above assumptions , contributions from @xmath52 ,",
    "@xmath53 type diagrams can be simplified to the familiar forms @xcite @xmath54 where in the first equation , we only keep the dominant contributions and in the second equation , we keep the dominant and subdominant ones .",
    "@xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 are the angles of the corresponding 2@xmath592 @xmath60 unitary matrices .",
    "unfortunately , the other equations , ( b3)-(b14 ) in appendix b , can not be simplified by following similar process because there are mixings between different vector - like generations .",
    "so these can only be analyzed numerically and will be discussed later .    at last , without loss of generality , among all 7 types of lpv trilinear couplings , we take 4 of them , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , for consideration while assuming the rest of them , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , are negligible .",
    "the realization through different lpv trilinear coupling combinations can be derived straightforwardly . the method to calculate the neutrino mass matrix we use",
    "is given in appendix c.    here we list the parameters of neutrino oscillation given by experiments , @xmath68 and @xmath69 ,   @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "scanning the parameter space with proper ewsb , we find by adjusting the ratios and values of the lpv trilinear couplings we choosing , the correct neutrino spectrum can be generated through the @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 type one - loop diagrams .",
    "numerical illustration is shown in table i , in set i we take the mass mixings assumptions mentioned before , in set ii we take different mass mixings and bigger vector - like masses for comparison .",
    "the specific parameters settings see appendix c.    .numerical illustration for 5 types of one - loop contributions in our model , the specific parameter settings see appendix b. @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) stands for the parts in eq .",

    "it worth to note that by decoupling the vector - like generation , correct neutrino masses and mixings can not be obtained via @xmath52 , @xmath90 type one - loop contributions .",
    "in addition , @xmath74 type contribution containing up - type ( s)quarks in the internal lines is absent in 3 g lpv models because the vector - like down - type doublet quark @xmath91 mixe with the right hand singlet top quark .    from table",
    "i , we can also see that by choosing @xmath82 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 type one - loop contributions , the correct neutrino spectrum can also been generated in parameters set ii , we do nt list the detailed results here .",

    "the related superpotential contributing to the lightest scalar higgs mass is shown in @xmath11 . according to the assumptions mentioned in the last section , we neglect the down - type higgs yukawa contributions and the small up - type contributions between the sm third generations and the extra vector - like generations .",

    "the higgs mass from the @xmath103 one - loop contributions is about 110 gev , for @xmath104 gev , @xmath105 gev and @xmath106 .",
    "direct search bounds from cms for exotic heavy top - like quark set limits of @xmath107 gev if @xmath108 @xcite and @xmath109 gev if @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "when considering the mass mixing between the vector - like quarks and the sm third generation quarks , in other words , considering the realistic branch ratios , the mass limit is adjust to be @xmath111 gev @xcite .",
    "so if we set the vector - like fermion masses in our model to be @xmath112 500 gev , the soft supersymmetry - breaking parameters to be @xmath113 700 gev , @xmath114gev and @xmath115 gev@xmath116 , then from eq .",
    "( 10 ) , in order to get approximately 125 gev higgs mass , for about @xmath117 gev and @xmath118 gev , we just need to set @xmath119 , or say , need to set @xmath120 gev .",
    "these values are just near their infrared quasi - fix point , as mentioned in last section .    evoked by the atlas and cms discovery of the enhancement in @xmath121 channel and little deviation in zz channel @xcite , the effects of the exotic vector - like quarks to the",
    "higgs production and decay have been extensively studied recently @xcite . in general , in a theory with @xmath122 vector - like generations extension , the new fermion contributions are suppressed by @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "so only the very large couplings to the higgs can obviously enhance the higgs production and decay in the @xmath121 channel @xcite , but as we have mentioned , these couplings have quasi - fix point which limits their tev values to be about 1 @xcite .",
    "this value is large enough to accommodate @xmath124 gev , but too small to influence the higgs decay , one ca nt depend on vector - like fermions by themselves to modify the higgs decay branching ratios .",
    "as far as the higgs problem to be concerned , extra vector - like fermions are mainly introduced to adjust the higgs mass .",
    "however , the @xmath121 and zz channel anomaly , if they persist , can be realized through the light stop scenario @xcite , which beyond our scope in this paper .",
    "to be clear , we list the new extra vector - like fermions below : @xmath125 in which @xmath126 mixes with @xmath127 ; @xmath128 mixes with @xmath129 ; @xmath130 mixes with @xmath131 ; @xmath132 mixes with @xmath133 , @xmath134 mixes with @xmath135 , @xmath136 mixes with @xmath137 .",
    "these exotic heavy fermions can decay into sm bosons , see fig .",
    "2 , which will analyze bellow .",
    "our analysis agree with the results given in @xcite .",
    "however the slightly difference comes from their neglect of the contributions proportional to @xmath138 in the vertex of feynman rules .",
    "note that theoretically speaking , when kinematically allowed , the exotic fermions predicted in our model have the other two decay modes : through supersymmetric gauge kinetic interactions or the supersymmetric yukawa interactions , decay into chargino / neutralino and sfermions , such as @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , where @xmath142 , i=1 - 4 , is neutralino , @xmath143 is chargino ; through lpv interactions , see eq .",

    "therefore , the exotic fermions can only decay into sm bosons .",
