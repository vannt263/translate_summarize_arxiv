    "the minimal gravitational sector of the standard - model extension ( mgsme ) is described by the action for conventional physics plus the lorentz violating term @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the coupling constant of general relativity ( gr ) , @xmath2 is the determinant of the metric @xmath3 , @xmath4 are the lorentz - violation ( lv ) coefficients , and @xmath5 is the riemann tensor .",
    "note that , since this work concerns curved spacetimes , lv has to arise spontaneously,@xcite and thus @xmath4 are dynamical .",
    "the @xmath4 can be separated into irreducible pieces as @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 stand , respectively , for the curvature scalar , the traceless ricci tensor , and the weyl tensor .",
    "note that @xmath10 and @xmath11 share the index symmetries of @xmath12 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "remarkably , to date , the effects of the @xmath11 coefficient are still unknown ; this is known as the @xmath13 puzzle.@xcite this contribution is devoted to describing several analyses where a fundamental explanation for this puzzle is sought .",
    "it is well known@xcite that field redefinitions can be used to move some lv coefficients to other sectors of the standard - model extension ( sme ) .",
    "it is thus natural to expect that a field redefinition could explain the @xmath13 puzzle . in gr ,",
    "the metric is the dynamical field .",
    "therefore , it is tempting to study what lv coefficients arise , in the gr action @xmath14 , with a redefinition @xmath15 . with a particular metric redefinition ,",
    "it is possible to show@xcite that , to first order in the lv coefficients , @xmath16,\\ ] ] where a total divergence , which has no physical effects , has been ignored .",
    "this result implies that the @xmath17 and @xmath10 coefficients can be moved to other sme sectors , which is consistent with previous results in linearized metric approximation.@xcite in addition , it proves that @xmath11 can not be removed with a metric redefinition .    in gr",
    "there are two equivalent dynamical formalisms : the standard and the palatini . in the first approach ,",
    "the metric is the only dynamical field and the ( torsionless ) connection is determined by requiring that the covariant derivative of the metric vanishes . in the latter approach ,",
    "the metric and the connection are assumed to be dynamically independent fields and the equation of motion for the connection yields the condition that the metric covariant derivative vanishes.@xcite if the metric and the connection can be treated as independent fields , it is possible to perform more general field redefinitions .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that , to first order in the lv coefficients , the mgsme yields the same physical predictions in both approaches.@xcite however , these independent redefinitions are not extremely revealing : the metric redefinition leads to the @xmath17 and @xmath10 terms ( with no divergence ) , while the connection redefinition produces new terms that are definitively not of the form of @xmath18.@xcite therefore , the @xmath11 term can not be removed with field redefinitions of the gravitational fields .",
    "an analytic tensor with the index symmetries of the weyl tensor can be written in terms of the covariant derivative ( @xmath19 ) of a ` lanczos potential ' @xmath20.@xcite this potential is such that @xmath21 , and @xmath22}$ ] , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 vanish . after replacing @xmath11 by its lanczos potential",
    ", the mgsme action takes the form @xmath25.\\ ] ] observe that the @xmath11 term has been converted into a dimension-@xmath26 operator , and this type of operator is known to generate , in the nonrelativistic weak - gravity approximation , unphysical self accelerations.@xcite this may be the reason behind the @xmath13 puzzle , but it is not a fundamental explanation .    it is also tempting to integrate the last term in eq .",
    "( [ mgsme action lanczos ] ) by parts , obtaining an effective @xmath10 coefficient : @xmath27 .",
    "however , @xmath28 depends on the metric ( through the covariant derivative ) , and thus it can not be considered as an lv coefficient .",
    "still , it should be stressed that , in the linearized gravity approximation and neglecting terms proportional to the lv coefficients and the metric perturbation , this procedure accounts for the absence of physical effects associated with @xmath11 .",
    "it is well known that , if the spacetime under consideration has boundaries , @xmath14 needs to be corrected with the so - called york  gibbons  hawking boundary term to lead to einstein s",
    "equations.@xcite this could be relevant for the @xmath13 puzzle since , typically , the phenomenological studies in the sme involve conformally flat spacetimes , which have boundaries .",
    "therefore , it should be verified if a boundary term can be constructed for all the coefficients in the mgsme .",
    "it turns out that such a boundary term exists for all coefficients in the mgsme , including @xmath11.@xcite however , such a term can not be constructed in the nonminimal sector , which needs to be carefully handled in the presence of spacetime boundaries .",
    "the last idea is related to the cauchy problem@xcite for the action of the lv coefficients .",
    "generically , it is hard to study this problem .",
    "therefore , it is useful to focus on a simpler case . in a particular example of the so - called bumblebee models@xcite where the vector field has a maxwell kinetic term and a potential that drives the spontaneous lorentz violation ,",
    "it has been shown that there exists a hamilton density that generates a constraint - compatible evolution , but that the evolution is not uniquely determined by the required initial data.@xcite in the future , the question that needs to be analyzed is whether the feasible actions for @xmath11 have well - posed cauchy problems .",
    "to date , the physical effects of a coefficient in the mgsme , @xmath11 , remain unknown .",
    "while searching for a fundamental reason for this puzzle , some lessons were learned : ( 1 ) redefinitions of the gravitational fields generate @xmath17 and @xmath10 but no @xmath11 , ( 2 ) the mgsme can be treated _  la palatini _ , ( 3 ) it is possible to correct the mgsme action to cancel spacetime boundary effects , but there is no boundary term for the nonminimal sector , and ( 4 ) the cauchy problem for theories with spontaneous lorentz violation may be ill posed .",
    "the fact that no fundamental explanation for the @xmath13 puzzle has been found suggests that @xmath11 could be physical , and that the phenomenological methods that have been used could be hiding its effects .",
    "it thus seems promising to look for the effects of @xmath11 in different phenomenological schemes .",
