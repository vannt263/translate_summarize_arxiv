    "recent research on quantum computation and quantum information allowed to extend the scope game theory for the quantum world @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we showed how quantum game theory may be used for describing financial market phenomena @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extent the previous results to incorporate also quantum version of english auctions .",
    "such a generalization is desirable because auctions prevail among market games and we think that quantum - like approach provide us with more precise models of market phenomena than the standard ones based on probability theory .",
    "the quantum - like description of market phenomena has a remarkable chance of gaining favourable reception from the experts .",
    "on the other hand only thorough investigation may reveal if economics already is in or would ever enter the domain of quantum theory .",
    "quantum computation is on the verge of being recognized as an autonomous scientific discipline and efforts to unify social and physical phenomena should not cause astonishment @xcite .",
    "it might be that while observing the due ceremonial of everyday market transaction we are in fact observing capital flows resulting from quantum games eluding classical description .",
    "`` if human decisions can be traced to microscopic quantum events one would expect that nature would have taken advantage of quantum computation in evolving complex brains . in that sense",
    "one could indeed say that quantum computers are playing their market games according to quantum rules '' @xcite .",
    "+ in the following sections we consider quantum english auctions and analyze possible profits gained under various conditions .",
    "vickrey s auctions and various generalizations would be presented in following papers .",
    "let us consider a particular case of quantum bargaining ( @xmath0-bargaining ) @xcite in which the first player , denoted by -1 for future convenience , sells a definite amount of some good and the second one , denoted by @xmath1 want to buy the good in question .",
    "the player @xmath1 proposes a price and the player -1 accept or reject the proposal .",
    "their polarizations @xcite are @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively so the @xmath0-bargaining has the polarization @xmath4 .",
    "the transaction in question is accomplished if the obvious rationality condition is fulfilled @xmath5,\\ ] ] where the convenient iverson notation @xcite is used ( @xmath6 $ ] denotes the logical value ( 1 or 0 ) of the sentence @xmath7 ) and the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 are random variables corresponding to prices at which the respective players withdraw , the _ withdrawal prices_. the random variables @xmath10 and @xmath11 describe additively profits resulting from price variations .",
    "their probability densities are equal to squared absolute values of the appropriate wave functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( that is their strategies ) .",
    "note that the discussed @xmath0-bargaining may result from a situation where several players have intention of buying but they were outbid by the player @xmath1 ( his withdrawal price @xmath14 was greater than the other players ones , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) .",
    "this means that all part in the auction are fermions and they are subjected to the pauli exclusion principle according to which two players can not occupy the same state .",
    "the fermionic character of @xmath0-bargaining parts first noted in @xcite in a slightly different context .",
    "if at the outset of the auction there are several bidding players then the rationality condition takes the form @xmath17\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the logarithm of the highest bid multiplied by -1 .",
    "the probability density of making the transaction with the @xmath19-th buyers at the price @xmath20 is according to ref .",
    "[ 5 ] given by @xmath21\\;[q_k+p\\leq0].\\ ] ] the seller is not interested in making the deal with any particular buyer and the unconditional probability of accomplishing the transaction at the price @xmath22 is given by the sum over @xmath23 of the above formula with @xmath24 .",
    "if we neglect the problem of determining the probability amplitudes in @xmath25 we easily note that the discussed @xmath0-bargaining is in fact the english auction ( first price auction ) so popular on markets of rare goods . from the quantum context it is interesting to note that the formula @xmath25contains wave functions of payers who were outbid before the end of the bargaining ( cf the pauli exclusion principle ) . the probability density of `` measuring '' of a concrete value @xmath0 of the random variable @xmath11 characterizing the player , according to the probabilistic interpretation of quantum theory , is equal to the squared absolute value of the normalized wave function describing his strategy @xmath26 physicists normalize wave functions because conservation laws require that .",
    "therefore the trivial statement that if a market player may be persuaded into making a deal or not is a matter of price alone , corresponds to the physical fact that a particle can not vanish without any trace .",
    "the most frequent scenario of an english auction is the one with public reserve price ( bids lower than the reserve price are rejected ) .",
    "the quantum version of such an action may defined as the auction when measures are cut from one side and the player -1 does not fix his withdrawal price ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "we can not identify withdrawal and the reserve prices in quantum approach because this would result in contradiction because it would entangle the reserve price with the players -1 polarization which forbiden by the pauli exclusion principle ( both players would wind up in the same polarization state before settlement of the bargain ) .",
    "+ we restrict our analysis to quantum english auctions during which the player -1 has fixed withdrawal price @xmath28 .",
    "the corresponding probability measure is equal to @xmath29 .",
    "we will also suppose that players are allowed to use mixed strategies .",
    "in that case the squared absolute values of probability amplitudes @xmath30 in @xmath25 should be replaced by appropriate convex linear combination @xmath31 .",
    "+ if for some @xmath32 the formula @xmath25 might by replaced by the measure @xmath33\\;\\eta(q_{k'}\\negthinspace)\\,dq_{k'}\\ ] ] then the auction in question reduces the merchandising mathematician model @xcite that is to @xmath0-bargaining with the polarization @xmath34 and the player -1 strategy being a proper state of the operator of supply @xmath35 or operator of demand @xmath36 if she is selling or buying , respectively .",
    "this may happen if the measure of the set of events for which @xmath37 is negligible eg @xmath38-th player offers are to high for the rest of participants .",
    "let us now consider the class of english auctions with all @xmath39 buyers having the same density of distribution of the logarithm of the withdrawal price , @xmath40 , which may be interpreted as the strategy of a equilibrium market with the mean value of the withdrawal price equal to zero ( one may always find appropriate currency units ) .",
    "the formula @xmath25 reduces to @xmath41 \\;\\eta(q)\\ ; \\bigl ( \\int_{q}^{\\infty } \\negthinspace\\negthinspace\\eta(r)\\ ; dr\\ ; \\bigr)^{n-1}dq\\ ] ] because the probability of success in the auction with price belonging to @xmath42 $ ] does not depend on the player .",
    "the random variable @xmath43 represents the profits measured by the compound rate of return achieved by the player -1 in the auction with respect to the average market price of the good being sold . to measure the profits of the seller",
    "is sufficient to notice that her situation is identical to @xmath0-bargaining with fixed polarization .",
    "her abstract opponent being the rest of the world @xcite might accomplish the bargaining by bidding price whose logarithm with reversed sing is a random variable @xmath44 with the distribution equal to @xmath39 times the distribution @xmath45 that is the function @xmath46 ( 1th - order statistics @xcite ) .",

    "let us recall that @xmath51 has a remarkable property of attaining it maximal value at a fixed point , that , if @xmath52 has normal distribution , is a contraction almost everywhere .",
    "normal distributions play a special role in quantum market games models because they exhaust the class of positive definite pure strategies @xcite .",
    "they describe also equilibrium markets .",
    "therefore til the end of next paragrph we will suppose that @xmath40 is a normal distribution . if @xmath53 is a contraction then the opponent of bidders may use a natural method of maximization of her profit intensity .",
    "the method consists in repeated corrections of the withdrawal price up to the value equal to mean profit intensity @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the character of the distribution @xmath40 is not necessary .",
    "but if the number of bidders is big the same result may be achieved by setting the withdrawal price to zero ( @xmath54 ) .",

    "the player -1 profits measured with respect to the mean value of the logarithm of market price of the good being sold must be balanced by the loss winning bidder ( modulo the possible brokerage that we neglect ) .",
    "it follows that in case the player -1 does not fix her withdrawal price the intensity of average losses of bidders is equal to @xmath62 .",
    "therefore the increase in the number of bidders is advantageous to both sides .",
    "it is not possible to reduce the number of players by forming linear combinations .",
    "such a characteristics being a direct consequence of the quantum no - delete theorem @xcite forbids manipulations on the quantum level and stabilizes the equilibrium gained by pure strategies of bidders acting as anonymous rest of the world @xcite .",
    "the present day growing popularity of internet auctions and almost unlimited access to such auction organized by robots raises the of maximal profit intensity in english @xmath0-auction with large ( @xmath63 ) number of bidders . in this case",
    "the approximation by the function @xmath60 is no longer valid .",
    "but fortunately it is possible to find the asymptotic behaviour of the function @xmath64 .",
    "to this end it is sufficient to find the asymptotic behaviour of the random variable @xmath65 where the series @xmath66 and @xmath67 are given by @xmath68 if @xmath40 is the standard normal distribution then the cumulative distribution function of the random variable @xmath69 being the rescaled logarithm of the price striking the bargain tends to the gumbel cumulative distribution function ( double exponential ) @xcite @xcite @xmath70 the expectation value of a random variable with probability density @xmath71 is equal to the euler constant @xmath72 .",

    "recall @xcite that , in the quantum approach , the logarithm of a contingent reselling price of the good in question is indefinite so that @xmath79 .",

    "but if she insists on buying the good she will try to guess such a withdrawal price @xmath84 to be able to bid the possible highest price @xmath85 that would not exceed @xmath86 .",
    "it is worth to note here that the quantum theory allows to multiply positive profits of a bidder that may be meagre in a single auction .",
    "the pauli exclusion principle does not forbid winning in several auctions if only the players strategy defeated the rivals ( it might not result in buying : the sellers withdrawal price might be to high ) .",
    "immediate teleportation of the state ( strategy ) @xcite makes such quantum market technics possible and effective .",
    "the consequences of the fact that strategies can not be multiplied ( undividity of attention ) @xcite resulting from the no - cloning theorem @xcite are not explained by classical models .",
    "the possibility of effective using the same strategy at different sites allows to make the profits arbitrary large .",
    "this paradox present in classical approaches should incline to research into quantum market games .",
    "the no - cloning theorem may also explain our ignorance of our and opponents strategy states : the knowledge would mean cloning .",
    "the results presented in the previous there paragraphs have to be modified if we suppose that the players joining an auction in the circumstances where the bidders know the prices @xmath87 at which they may resell the bought good and the price @xmath88 seller paid the good ( or the value it presents to him ) .",
    "adherents of utility theory may that the parameters @xmath89 corresponds to the utilities of auctioned good characterizing the appropriate players .",
    "so all participants know the value ( that may depend on the player ) of the good being auctioned .",
    "in this case we should substitute the appropriate wigner functions @xcite for the squared absolute values of amplitudes in @xmath25 : @xmath90 so if we take into consideration mixed strategies of participants @xmath91 ( that is convex linear combinations of wigner functions ) we get @xmath92\\;[q_k+p_{\\text{-}1}\\leq0]\\ ] ] instead of the measure @xmath25 .",

    ". the fascinating class of english @xmath0-auctions with giffen strategies requires a separate analysis .",
    "the analysis of english @xmath0-auction with reversed roles that is bidders are selling is analogous .",
    "more interesting is the case when the polarization of the @xmath0-auction is changed to @xmath97 . in this case",
    "the player -1 reveals her withdrawal price and the player 2 accepts it ( and those of the rest of the players ) or not .",
    "such an auction is known as the vickrey s auction ( or the second price auction ) .",

    "the quantum context of the very popular ( cf the 1996 nobel price justification ) vickrey s auction will be analysed in a separate paper .",
    "+ if we consider only positive definite probability measures then bidder gets the highest profits in vickrey s auction using strategies with public admission of his valuation of the auctioned good .",
    "but it might not be so for giffen strategies because positiveness of measures is supposed in proving incentive character of vickrey s auctions @xcite .",
    "the presence of giffens on real markets might not be so abstract as it seems to be .",
    "captain robert giffen who is supposed to find additive measure not being positive definite but present on existing real market in the forties of the xix century @xcite probably got ahead of physicists in observing quantum phenomena .",
    "such departures from the demand low if correctly interpreted do not cause any problem neither for adepts nor for beginners .",
    "employers have probably always thought that work supply as function of payment is scarcely monotonous .",
    "+ the distinguished by their polarization first and second price auctions have analogues in the knaster solution to the pragmatic fair division problem that is with compensatory payments for indivisible parts of the property @xcite .",
    "such a duality might be found even in election systems that as auctions form procedures of solving fair division problems @xcite .",
