    "given a convex domain @xmath4 we consider the family of its _ inner parallel sets_. we denote by @xmath5 the inner parallel set at distance @xmath6 , which is defined by @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the unit ball in @xmath9 and @xmath10 denotes the _ minkowski difference _ ; a precise definition is given in section  [ sec : notationprel ] .",

    "an important result in the theory of outer parallel sets is the so - called _ steiner formula _",
    "@xmath14 where coefficients @xmath15 of the polynomial are the _ quermassintegrals _ of @xmath0 , which are a special case of mixed volumes ( see section  [ sec : notationprel ] ) .",
    "the set of quermassintegrals contains several important geometric quantities : for instance we have that @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "there are analogous formulae to  , called the _ steiner formulae _",
    "@xcite , that express the value of the @xmath18-th quermassintegral of @xmath19 in terms of @xmath20 , for @xmath21 .",

    "there is , in general , no counterpart to the steiner formula .",
    "matheron conjectured in  @xcite that the volume of a minkowski difference is bounded from below by the _ alternating steiner polynomial .",
    "_ if we restrict our attention to inner parallel sets he conjectured that @xmath22 the precise conjecture was a more general statement where @xmath8 is replaced by a general convex body and the quermassintegrals are replaced by mixed volumes .",
    "however , the conjecture was proved to be false by hernndez cifre and saorn in  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the lack of a steiner - type formula , the minkowski difference is far from being as well behaved as the minkowski sum .",
    "in contrast to the minkowski sum the difference is not a vectorial operation . moreover , the regularity properties of @xmath23 may be very different from those of @xmath0 .",
    "both of these properties are demonstrated in figure  [ fig : innerparallelset ] .",

    "the inequalities obtained in this paper are closely related to those in  @xcite , and using similar techniques the results here could , at least in some sense , be generalized to the same setting . however , in such generalizations the connection to the spectral theoretic applications that motivated the work in this paper is lost .",

    "* @xmath77 is multilinear with respect to minkowski addition : @xmath81 * @xmath77 is monotonically increasing with respect to inclusions .",
    "* @xmath77 is invariant under translations in each argument . *",
    "the perimeter of @xmath82 is , up to a constant , equal to a mixed volume : @xmath83    we will by @xmath84 denote the _ support function _ of @xmath85 which is defined for any @xmath86 as @xmath87 the restriction of @xmath84 to @xmath88 reduces to the function describing the distance from the origin to the supporting hyperplane of @xmath89 with normal @xmath90 . in what follows",

    "@xmath109 of a set @xmath54 , which , following  @xcite , is defined by @xmath110 if @xmath0 is a polytope then @xmath109 is the polytope that has the same set of normals as @xmath0 , but with each face translated so that it is tangent to the unit ball .",
    "if instead the boundary of @xmath0 is smooth ( in which case every point is regular ) then @xmath111 .",
    "the following lemma will be needed in our main proof and is an almost direct consequence of the definitions of @xmath109 and @xmath1 combined with the fact that almost every point of @xmath3 is regular .",

    ". then there exists @xmath48 such that @xmath112 .",
    "the idea of the proof is as follows : given a set @xmath113 and @xmath6 we construct a convex set @xmath114 such that @xmath115 and @xmath116 for any other set @xmath117 satisfying @xmath118 .",
    "if we can prove theorem  [ thm : mainrin ] for such @xmath114 it clearly holds also for any other convex set satisfying @xmath118 . since the choice of @xmath0 and @xmath44 was arbitrary this completes the proof .",
    "we begin by constructing the set @xmath114 . in the case where @xmath0 is a polygon this problem has the fairly intuitive solution that @xmath114 is the polygon with the same faces as @xmath0 , only moved a distance @xmath44 along their outward pointing normals .",
    "the following lemma tells us that a generalization of this intuitive solution actually works for any possible @xmath0 .",
    "recalling the properties of the support function , we have that for any @xmath121 there exists a @xmath96 normal to @xmath122 at @xmath101 such that @xmath123 rearranging this we find for all @xmath124 that @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , it follows that @xmath126 where we used that @xmath127 for @xmath124 and the last equality follows from  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2.2.6 ) .",
    "since the perimeter is increasing under inclusion of convex sets , we conclude that @xmath128 .",
    "what remains to complete the proof is to show that @xmath129 is an admissible set in the above maximization problem .",
    "that @xmath130 follows from the argument above so we only need to establish the opposite inclusion .",
    "let @xmath131 . then ,",
    "with @xmath90 being the unique normal to @xmath3 at @xmath101 , we have that @xmath132 since a convex body can be written as the intersection of its supporting half - spaces we conclude that @xmath133 implying that @xmath134 . combining this with the inclusion of @xmath0 in @xmath135 we find that @xmath136 . since almost every point of @xmath3 is regular the statement follows .",
    "we are now ready to prove theorem  [ thm : mainrin ] .",
    "let @xmath11 and let @xmath103 have inradius @xmath1 . by the above lemma we have , for any convex body @xmath137 such that @xmath138 , the bound @xmath139 , and by lemma  [ lem : inradiuslemma ] any such @xmath137 has the inradius @xmath140 .",
    "thus it is sufficient to prove that @xmath141 using the multilinearity of @xmath77 and fact that the perimeter of a convex set can be expressed as a mixed volume we find that @xmath142 by lemma  [ lem : inclusionformbody ] there exists @xmath48 such that @xmath143 .",
    "therefore by the translation invariance and the monotonicity of mixed volumes we find that @xmath144 rearranging the terms and using that @xmath145 one obtains the desired inequality .",
    "it is clear from the argument above that equality holds if and only if @xmath146 , that is when @xmath0 is homothetic to @xmath109 .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem  [ thm : mainrin ] .",
    "deducing corollary  [ cor : cormainwidth ] is simply a matter of applying the following theorem due to steinhagen  @xcite .",
    "we note that this theorem appeared in the case of planar convex bodies in earlier work by blaschke  @xcite , and this simpler case is sufficient for proving the inequality conjectured in  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath54 have inradius @xmath1 and width @xmath36 .",
    "then the following two - sided inequality holds : @xmath147 the lower bound is attained if @xmath0 is a ball , and the upper bound is attained if @xmath0 is a regular @xmath42-simplex .",
