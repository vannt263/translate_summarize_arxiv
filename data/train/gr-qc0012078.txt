    "an intriguing property of quantum physics is the particle creation generated by external fields , like a constant electric or magnetic field , or by quantum fluctuation of the vacuum . in this last case",
    "only virtual particles are involved .",
    "however when the energy scale is large enough virtual particles can be transformed into real . in line of principle",
    "the same mechanism can be shared by the gravitational field where virtual black holes @xcite can be created and annihilated in analogy with particle physics .",
    "this particular phenomenon has been investigated in different contexts and in particular when a cosmological constant is introduced@xcite . in this example",
    "the process is mediated by the corresponding gravitational instanton , and the semiclassical nucleation rate for a pair on a given background is given by @xmath0 .\\ ] ] @xmath1 is the classical action of the gravitational instanton mediating the pair creation , @xmath2 is the action of the background field , and @xmath3 is the prefactor containing quantum corrections . for the de  sitter ( ds ) space",
    "the quantum creation of black holes leads to the discovery of an unstable mode in the physical sector , when one - loop approximation is considered@xcite .",
    "this quantum instability is related to the @xmath4 instanton responsible for the pair creation process .",
    "this instanton , termed the nariai instanton@xcite , is nothing but the extreme schwarzschild - de sitter ( sds ) solution written in another system of coordinates .",
    "this instability leads to spontaneous nucleation of black holes signaling a transition from a false vacuum to a true one@xcite .",
    "this transition is possible when the energy stored in the boundaries is the same for both spaces@xcite .",
    "however as remarked in ref.@xcite , the nucleation appears with a temperature @xmath5 different from the temperature of the heat bath , which is the ds space with @xmath6 .",
    "this does not happen , for example , in the hot minkowski space where the nucleated black hole has the same temperature as the heat bath@xcite .",
    "the same situation holds even when we consider a negative cosmological constant , i.e. anti - de sitter ( ads ) space .",
    "in fact to spontaneously nucleate a black hole , which has an intrinsic temperature @xmath7 , the same temperature has to be imposed to the ads space @xcite .",
    "however in ref.@xcite , we have shown that a semi - classical instability ( wkb ) appears for minkowski space even at zero temperature , provided that boundary conditions be energy preserving .",
    "the same semi - classical instability appears also for the ads space@xcite with the same energy condition .",
    "an interesting common feature between these cases comes from the expression of the mixed ricci tensor @xmath8 computed in these different backgrounds , namely the schwarzschild , s - ads and sds metrics respectively . indeed in the first case , @xmath8 has components : @xmath9 while the case with the cosmological constant is @xmath10 where the upper case and the lower case are related to the sds and the s - ads metrics respectively and @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is the positive cosmological constant .",
    "it is straightforward to note that the only difference between these different tensors is in the presence of the cosmological term .",
    "this means that the source of instability residing in the first component appears even in the other cases .",
    "however , only at one loop is possible to reveal the presence or the absence of such an instability .",
    "we recall that one loop computations of the energy in this context represent a casimir - like energy which measures vacuum fluctuations .",
    "following refs.@xcite , we will consider a constant time slice @xmath13 of the sds manifold @xmath14 , we will report the details concerning the kruskal - szekeres description of the sds manifold . ] , whose perturbations at @xmath15 in absence of matter fields define quantum fluctuations of the einstein - rosen bridge . indeed , as will follow in section [ p1 ] even though the sds is not asymptotically flat , the hypersurface @xmath13 defines a wormhole with topology @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a sub - interval of @xmath18 .",
    "this is a consequence of having a cosmological radius which sets an upper bound to the radial coordinate . to this purpose",
    "we will fix our attention on a hamiltonian with boundary @xmath19 where @xmath20 is called the _",
    "function , @xmath21 is the _ shift _ function and @xmath22 @xmath23 represents the energy stored into the boundary .",
    "the aim of this paper is the evaluation of @xmath24 representing the total energy computed to one - loop in a sds background .",
    "@xmath25 is the reference space energy , i.e. the de sitter space .",
    "@xmath26 is the energy difference between the sds and the ds metrics , stored in the boundaries and @xmath27 is the quantum correction to the classical term .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows , in section [ p1 ] we compute the quasilocal energy for the sds space , in section [ p2 ] we give some of the basic rules to perform the functional integration to evaluate the energy density of the hamiltonian approximated up to second order in the sds background , in section [ p3 ] we look for stable modes of the spin - two operator acting on transverse traceless tensors , in section [ p4 ] we show the existence of only one negative mode under suitable conditions and we compute the energy density for stable modes , in section [ n ] , we confirm the existence of one negative mode for the extreme sds background , namely the nariai metric , also in our framework and we give a computation for the stable part in analogy with its non - extreme sector , in section [ p5 ] we find a critical radius below which we have a stabilization of the system .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section [ p6 ] .",
    "in this section we fix our attention to the classical part of eq.@xmath28 . we begin to define the line element @xmath29 referred to the sds metric , where @xmath30 for @xmath31 the metric describes the schwarzschild metric , while for @xmath32 , we obtain the de sitter metric ( ds ) @xmath33 the gravitational potential @xmath34 admits three real roots .",
    "one is negative and it is located at @xmath35 while @xmath36 are associated to the black hole and cosmological horizons respectively , with @xmath37 however in the wormhole language , we will say that @xmath38 is the inner throat and @xmath39 is the outer throat .",
    "note also that the hypersurface @xmath15 is described by the three - dimensional wormhole whose metric is @xmath40 where @xmath34 is given by eq.@xmath41 . a relation between the three roots",
    "is given by @xmath42 thus , we can write @xmath43 with @xmath44 .   \\label{p12aa}\\ ] ] since @xmath38 is a monotonic increasing function of @xmath45 , while @xmath39 is a monotonic decreasing with @xmath46 \\\\ r_{++}^{\\downharpoonright } \\in \\left [ 0,b\\right ] \\end{array } , \\right.\\ ] ] in order to have the inequality @xmath47 preserved , we have to consider @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "indeed when @xmath49 $ ] the inequality @xmath50 is reversed and the meaning of the internal and external roots is exchanged .",
    "thus the de sitter region delimited by the bound of eq.@xmath47 , at time fixed , can be represented as in fig.[f1 ] .",
    "a common value is reached when @xmath51 where @xmath52 and the metric is termed extreme .",
    "this particular case will be discussed in section [ n ] .",
    "however , instead of looking at the de sitter region with the topology of fig.[f1 ] , we will look at the einstein - rosen bridge corresponding to the inner bifurcation surface depicted in fig.[f2 ] .    at this point",
    "we can discuss the computation of the classical energy term @xmath53 which can be computed by means of quasilocal energy .",
    "quasilocal energy is defined as the value of the hamiltonian that generates unit time translations orthogonal to the two - dimensional boundary , @xmath54 where @xmath55 at @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature corresponding to the reference space , which in this case is the ds space . for practical purposes ,",
    "however , it is convenient to embed both spaces ( sds and ds ) into flat space and perform the subtraction procedure . to this purpose",
    "the radial coordinate @xmath58 continuous on @xmath14 is defined by @xmath59 where the plus sign is relative to @xmath60 , while the minus sign is related to @xmath61 .",
    "the surfaces located at @xmath38 and @xmath39 are bifurcation surfaces denoted @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "when @xmath32 , we obtain the embedding of ds space into flat space . in @xmath60 the evaluation of @xmath26 can be obtained as follows : first we consider the static einstein - rosen bridge associated to the sds space@xcite @xmath64 where @xmath20 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are functions of @xmath58 defined by eq.@xmath67 .",
    "second , we consider the boundary @xmath68 , located at @xmath69 , and its associated normal @xmath70 .",
    "the expression of the trace @xmath71 gives for the sds space @xmath72 note that if we make the identification @xmath73 , the line element @xmath74 reduces to the sds metric written in another form .",
    "the same applies to the ds metric by putting @xmath32 .",
    "nevertheless for our purposes the form of @xmath75 can be left unspecified .",
    "thus the computation of @xmath76 gives @xmath77 _ { |r = r}\\ ] ] @xmath78 , \\ ] ] where we have set @xmath32 in @xmath79 to obtain the ds energy contribution .",
    "when @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "thus for every finite value of the boundary exceeding the cosmological radius , the classical energy acquires an imaginary component which will not be here considered ] @xmath82 ] .",
    "in contrast , if we consider the approximation @xmath83 and @xmath84@xcite , we obtain @xmath85 = m.\\ ] ] thus the energy contribution limited to @xmath60 gives @xmath86 that is the ds space can not decay into the sds space because the associated boundary energy is different .",
    "this is in complete analogy with the schwarzschild and the s - ads cases .",
    "however if we look at the whole hypersurface @xmath87 the total classical energy becomes @xmath88 @xmath89 with @xmath90 @xmath91 here the boundaries @xmath68 and @xmath92 are located in the two disconnected regions @xmath93 and @xmath94 respectively with coordinate values @xmath95 and the trace of the extrinsic curvature in both regions is @xmath96 thus one gets @xmath97 where for @xmath98 we have used the conventions relative to @xmath61 and @xmath92 .",
    "therefore for every value of the boundary @xmath18 , ( provided we take symmetric boundary conditions with respect to the bifurcation surface ) , we have @xmath99 namely the energy is conserved . as stressed in ref.@xcite , since we have a spacetime with a bifurcation surface , the quantities @xmath100 and @xmath101 have the same relative sign , while the total energy is given by the sum @xmath102 .",
    "the energies associated to the boundaries are symmetric and they have the same relative sign while the total energy reflects the orientation reversal of the two boundaries .",
    "since the total classical energy is conserved we can discuss the existence of an instability .",
    "to this aim we refer to the variational approach to compute the energy density to one - loop@xcite .",
    "in previous section we have fixed our attention to the classical part of eq.@xmath103 . in this section ,",
    "we apply the same calculation scheme of refs.@xcite to compute one loop corrections to the classical sds term . like the schwarzschild and the s - ads case ,",
    "there appear two classical constraints @xmath104 and two _ quantum _ constraints @xmath105 for the hamiltonian respectively , which are satisfied both by the sds and ds metric on shell .",
    "@xmath106 @xmath107 is known as the _ wheeler - dewitt _ equation ( wdw ) .",
    "our purpose is the computation of @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the total hamiltonians referred to the sds and ds spacetimes respectively for the volume term@xcite and @xmath111 is a wave functional obtained following the usual wkb expansion of the wdw solution . in this context , the approximated wave functional will be substituted by a _",
    "trial wave functional _ of the gaussian form according to the variational approach we shall use to evaluate @xmath112 . to compute such a quantity",
    "we will consider on @xmath13 deviations from the sds metric spatial section of the form , @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the spatial sds background . by setting @xmath32 in eq.@xmath115 on the same slice",
    "we will obtain perturbations also for the de sitter metric .",

    "now , we have the desired decomposition on the tangent space of 3-metric deformations@xcite : @xmath128 where the operator @xmath129 maps @xmath130 into symmetric tracefree tensors @xmath131 then the inner product between three - geometries becomes @xmath132 @xmath133 .",

    "this particular result has been obtained by looking at the partition function and therefore with the introduction of an equilibrium temperature , that in the case of the pure schwarzschild and flat metric can be imposed to be equal , but in the present case ( i.e. the sds metric and the ds metric ) it can not .",
    "therefore as stressed in ref.@xcite , it is not very clear how these spaces having a different temperature ( periodicity ) can be compared . on the other hand",
    "if we adopt the hamiltonian approach we can avoid the introduction of a temperature and it is possible to build a scheme where the classical contribution is conserved ; this point is fundamental to discuss the instability@xcite .",
    "what we have found , in our framework , is the well known existence of an unstable mode in the s wave for the extreme sds metric ( nariai ) but we have also found that an unstable mode exists also for the sds metric . to interpret such an instability as a decay process nucleating a black hole pair , we need to show the existence of only `` * one negative mode * '' @xcite . unfortunately , in our approximation",
    "we have discovered a dependence of the number of negative modes on @xmath45 the variable defined in eq.@xmath345 . in particular , we have seen that the closest is the approach to the extreme value @xmath51 , the highest is the number of negative eigenvalues falling into the negative spectrum .",
    "this abundance of negative eigenvalues can be limited if we restrict the variability of @xmath45 into the interval @xmath346 ; in this range coleman arguments can be applied .",
    "however the proliferation of negative modes in the nearly extremal sds metric is a consequence of the approximated potential of the eigenvalue equation . indeed by using nearly degenerate coordinates like those in eq.@xmath347 , only one negative eigenvalue appears .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the appearance of a negative mode , even for the sds metric , can be related with the production of a sub - maximal black hole pair@xcite .",
    "what is interesting to observe is the existence of a critical radius @xmath348 below which the instability disappears .",
    "this could open the possibility of an existing foam - like space composed by copies of bubbles in analogy with the model discussed in ref.@xcite . even in this case ,",
    "a dependence of the ultraviolet cut - off is present .",
    "this is principally due to the non renormalizability of quantum gravity . however , the fact that the same divergent behaviour appears also in this case it is a signal of a more general situation typically concerning the spherically symmetric metrics , that is every spherically symmetric metric describing a wormhole ( black hole ) can produce in the spectrum of quantum fluctuations in a semiclassical approximation one negative mode , provided the boundary conditions be energy conserving .",
    "the author would like to thank r. bousso and m. volkov for useful comments and suggestions .",
    "we have defined the sds line element in eq.@xmath349 . to introduce the kruskal - szekeres@xcite type",
    "coordinates we consider the following transformation @xmath350 + r^{2}d\\omega ^{2}\\ ] ] @xmath351 where @xmath352 is the ingoing radial null coordinate and @xmath353 is the outgoing radial null coordinate .",
    "the `` tortoise coordinate '' @xmath354 is defined by @xmath355 and by means of the surface gravity associated to each root , we write @xmath356 where @xmath34 has been defined by eq.@xmath41 , while @xmath357 and @xmath358 by eq.@xmath359 and eq.@xmath245 , respectively .",
    "the last surface gravity associated with the negative root is @xmath360 thus @xmath361 to avoid singularities we can define kruskal - szekeres type coordinates @xmath362 these coordinates do not cover @xmath363 because of the coordinate singularity at @xmath364 ( and @xmath365 is complex for @xmath363 ) , but @xmath364 and a similar four regions are covered by the @xmath366 kruskal - szekeres - type coordinates to this case .",
    "@xmath367 for the @xmath368 sign we have @xmath369 and the respective line element is @xmath370 @xmath371 while for the @xmath372 sign we have @xmath373 and the associated line element is @xmath374 @xmath375 the conformal penrose diagram of the sds space is shown in fig.[f4 ] .",
    "regions limited by @xmath376 lie between the black hole and cosmological horizon .",
    "regions @xmath377 correspond to an asymptotic de sitter region and region @xmath378 to the black hole interior .",
