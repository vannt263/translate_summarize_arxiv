    "the galactic high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) , gas clouds detected via 21 cm emission or uv / optical absorption at velocities that deviate substantially from normal galactic rotation ( wakker & van woerden 1997 ) , have potentially important implications regarding the structure and evolution of the galaxy and local group . for example , if the hvcs provide a sufficient quantity of infalling low - metallicity gas , they can alleviate the g - dwarf problem , the long - standing discrepancy between the observed metallicity distribution of g - dwarf stars and theoretical expectations ( e.g. , larson 1972 ; tosi 1988 ; wakker et al .",
    "1999 ; gibson et al .",
    "the hvcs may have important cosmological implications as well .",
    "hierarchical models of galaxy formation within the cold dark matter framework predict many more dwarf satellite galaxies within the local group than have been detected / identified ( e.g. , klypin et al .",
    "1999 ; moore et al .",
    "a variety of solutions to this problem have been proposed , including the possibility that the hvcs are the missing dwarfs which , for some reason , have not formed readily detectable stars ( e.g. , blitz et al . 1999 ; klypin et al . 1999 ; gibson et al . 2002 ) .    however , the nature of most high - velocity gas is still poorly understood , mainly because the cloud distances are highly uncertain .",
    "some of the hvcs are clearly material stripped out of the magellanic clouds , the `` magellanic stream '' ( mathewson , cleary , & murray 1974 ; putman et al .",
    "1998 ; lockman et al . 2002 ) , and some high - velocity absorption lines observed towards disk stars are most likely related to the interaction between stars / supernovae and the ism ( e.g. , cowie , songaila , & york 1979 ; trapero et al .",
    "1996 ; jenkins et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ; welty et al . 1999",
    "; tripp et al . 2002 ) .",
    "apart from these clouds , direct distance constraints are scarce and difficult to obtain ( wakker 2001 ) , and consequently a variety of hvc models remain viable .",
    "the hvcs may have a galactic origin such as the galactic fountain ( shapiro & field 1976 ; bregman 1980 ) , or they may be extragalactic ( e.g. , oort 1970 ; blitz et al . 1999 ; braun & burton 1999 ) .    given the difficulty of direct distance measurements , it is important to explore other constraints on the nature of these objects .",
    "for example , constraints on the distribution and size of the hvcs can be derived from studies of other galaxy groups using either qso absorption line statistics ( charlton , churchill , & rigby 2000 ) or surveys for redshifted 21 cm emission ( zwaan & briggs 2000 ; zwaan 2001 ; braun & burton 2001 ; pisano & wilcots 2003 ) . for the milky way hvcs",
    ", it has been suggested that the h@xmath6 emission from the clouds constrains their distances ( e.g. , bland - hawthorn et al .",
    "if the gas is photoionized by uv flux escaping from the galaxy , then nearby clouds should be substantially brighter in h@xmath6 than distant hvcs .",
    "h@xmath6 emission has in fact been detected from a variety of hvcs ( e.g. , weiner & williams 1996 ; tufte et al .",
    "1998 , 2002 ; weiner , vogel , & williams 2002 ) , and detailed photoionization models place the clouds roughly 5 @xmath7 50 kpc away based on the observed h@xmath6 intensities ( weiner et al .",
    "2002 ; bland - hawthorn & maloney 2002 ) . however , several observations cloud the interpretation of h@xmath6 intensities . first , the magellanic stream , which has an independently constrained distance , is much brighter in h@xmath6 than predicted by the photoionization models ( weiner et al .",
    "2002 ; bland - hawthorn & maloney 2002 ) .",
    "second , the magellanic stream h@xmath6 emission is spatially variable ( see figure 1 in weiner et al . 2002 ) , also contrary to the predictions of the photoionization models .",
    "finally , absorption has been detected in a substantial fraction of the hvcs ( sembach et al .",
    "2000 , 2002 ; wakker et al .",
    "2002 ) . while can be produced by photoionization in large , low - density intergalactic gas clouds ( e.g. , tripp & savage 2000 ; tripp et al .",
    "2001 ) , the in hvcs is almost certainly collisionally ionized ( the cloud sizes required by photoionization models are excessive for hvcs , see sembach et al .",
    "these observations suggest that collisional processes play an important role in the ionization of hvcs and the production of h@xmath6 emission .",
    "the interaction of the rapidly moving clouds with ambient magnetic fields may create instabilities that also play a role in the gas ionization and production of h@xmath6 emission ( konz et al .",
    "2001 ) . for these reasons , h@xmath6 distance constraints from photoionization models may need to be revisited .",
    "ultraviolet absorption lines in the spectra of background quasars and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) provide another sensitive probe for the study of galactic ( as well as extragalactic ) hvcs . uv absorption lines provide detailed information on abundances and physical conditions in the gas , and this in turn",
    "can be compared to predictions of various models .",
    "for example , it is expected that galactic fountain gas would have a substantially higher metallicity than infalling extragalactic gas or gas stripped from a satellite galaxy . _",
    "relative _ metal abundance patterns may also provide insights on the enrichment history of the hvcs ; if the gas is relatively pristine , overabundances of @xmath6 elements or underabundances of nitrogen might be observed , as seen in low - metallicity stars ( mcwilliam 1997 ) and regions ( vila - costas & edmunds 1993 ; henry , edmunds , & kppen 2000 ) .    in this paper",
    "we use the absorption line technique to explore the nature of hvc complex c , a large hvc ( roughly 20@xmath8 ) that is at least @xmath95 kpc away ( van woerden et al . 1999 ) . a number of complex c abundance measurements = log(x / y ) @xmath7 log(x / y)@xmath10 , and",
    "we indicate the overall metallicity with the variable @xmath5 .",
    "] have been published for a variety of species ranging from [ n / h ] = @xmath11 to [ fe / h ] = @xmath12 ( bowen , blades , & pettini 1995 ; wakker et al .",
    "1999 ; murphy et al .",
    "2000 ; richter et al . 2001 ; gibson et al .",
    "2001 ; collins et al .",
    "however , some of these abundances may be confused by ionization effects .",
    "species such as or can arise in ionized as well as neutral gas leading to _ overestimates _ of [ s / h ] or [ fe / h ] if no ionization correction is applied , while other species such as can be more readily ionized than leading to _ underestimation _ of the elemental abundance .",
    "the most robust species for constraining the metallicity of hvcs is . like sulfur ,",
    "oxygen is only lightly depleted by dust grains ( see  6.2.1 in moos et al .",
    "2002 , and references therein ) , but more importantly , the ionization potential of is nearly identical to that of , and is strongly locked to by resonant charge exchange ( field & steigman 1971 ) . consequently , oxygen abundances based on and are relatively impervious to ionization effects ( unless the gas is quite substantially ionized ) .",
    "richter et al . (",
    "2001 ) have presented the first measurement of [ o / h ] in complex c using spectra of pg1259 + 593 obtained with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) and the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ ; they find [ o / h ] = @xmath13 .",
    "notably , richter et al . also report that nitrogen is highly underabundant ( by @xmath9 1 dex compared to oxygen ) , and the @xmath6 elements are marginally overabundant compared to iron .",
    "these results suggest that complex c is a relatively pristine extragalactic cloud plunging into the galaxy for the first time .",
    "this notion has been challenged by gibson et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who have observed in several directions through complex c and find evidence of spatial variability of the sulfur abundance .",
    "sulfur abundances derived from alone are prone to ionization effects , as noted , but recently collins , shull , & giroux ( 2003 ) have also reported variable metallicity in complex c based on oxygen measurements .    here we present new constraints on the metallicity as well as the physical conditions , structure , and nature of high - velocity cloud complex c from uv absorption lines . our analysis is mainly based on high - resolution echelle spectroscopy of 3c 351 obtained with stis , but we make use of high - resolution observations of nearby sight lines to augment the results with spatial information , e.g. , on the transverse extent of the absorbing gas .",
    "we also briefly discuss intermediate - velocity gas in the 3c 351 direction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we begin with a summary of 21 cm emission observations of high - velocity gas in the direction of 3c 351 (  [ sec21 cm ] ) , followed by a brief summary of the stis observations (  [ secobs ] ) and the absorption line measurements (  [ secmeas ] ) .",
    "we then argue that ionization corrections are likely to be important for these clouds , and we employ collisional and photoionization models to constrain their abundances (  [ secabun ] ) .",
    "the abundances indicate that complex c and the intermediate - velocity gas likely have different origins ; we suggest that complex c is an infalling , low - metallicity cloud while the ivc is outflowing gas from the perseus spiral arm . in the discussion of our measurements , we consider the implications of the density and size of the absorbing gas derived from the ionization models including the confinement of the gas (  [ secstructure ] ) , and we compare 3c 351 to other nearby sight lines in the vicinity of complex c (  [ seccompare ] ) .",
    "we find evidence that the lower latitude portion of complex c is more affected by interactions with the ambient medium that the higher latitude region of the cloud .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  [ secsum ] . throughout this paper",
    "we present spectra and velocities relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) . at 19.5 km s@xmath0 . with this convention ,",
    "the conversion to heliocentric velocity is given by @xmath14 km s@xmath0 for 3c 351 . ]",
    "the sight line to 3c 351 ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) probes an intriguing region of the high - velocity sky .",
    "a portion of the hulsbosch & wakker ( 1988 ) 21 cm emission map of complex c , centered on 3c 351 , is shown in figure  [ hw_map21 cm ] . in this figure ,",
    "the color scale shows the lsr gas velocity while the contours indicate brightness temperature .",
    "the lowest contour shown corresponds to @xmath4 ( ) = @xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "complex c shows several well - defined cores ; the 3c 351 sight line is roughly equidistant in projection from the cib , cd , and ck cores [ see wakker ( 2001 , and references therein ) for definitions of the cores and nomenclature ] .",
    "ck has a lower velocity than most of complex c and may be more closely associated with the intermediate - velocity cloud complex k than the high - velocity complex c cloud ( see wakker 2001 and haffner , reynolds , & tufte 2001 ) .",
    "figure  [ lds_ivc ] shows the intermediate - velocity 21 cm sky in the vicinity of 3c 351 . the map in figure  [ lds_ivc ] plots column densities derived from the 21 cm leiden - dwingeloo survey ( lds ; hartmann & burton 1997 ) integrated over @xmath19 km s@xmath0 . at @xmath20 , the intermediate - velocity sky",
    "is dominated by the `` iv arch '' , but at lower latitudes it is unclear whether the emission is associated with the iv arch , complex k , or a lower - velocity region of complex c ( see wakker 2001 ) .",
    "we provide evidence below that the ck ivc and complex c proper have different origins (   5.4,6 ) .",
    "we shall refer to the 3c 351 intermediate - velocity absorption system as c / k hereafter and complex c proper ( @xmath21 km s@xmath0 ) as simply complex c.    a notable feature of complex c is the presence of 21 cm emission at substantially higher velocities ( @xmath22 km s@xmath0 ) along the central ridge of the cloud superimposed on the main hvc emission ( @xmath23 km s@xmath0 ) .",
    "the higher velocity emission is indicated with half - circles in figure  [ hw_map21 cm ] ( see also figure 6 in wakker 2001 ) .",
    "the nature of the higher velocity component is not entirely clear , but it has a similar morphology to the lower velocity complex c gas , and it is centered on complex c. for convenience , we refer to this cloud as the `` high - velocity ridge '' ( hvr ) in this paper .",
    "a variety of uv absorption lines are detected from the high - velocity ridge in the 3c 351 spectrum as well as complex c , and unlike c vs. c / k , the uv absorption lines provide evidence that the hv ridge and complex c are closely related ( see below ) .",
    "the column densities in complex c and the high - velocity ridge are shown in figures  [ lds_compc ] and [ lds_hvr ] , respectively .",
    "figures  [ lds_compc]-[lds_hvr ] show 21 cm emission maps from the lds integrated over @xmath24 km s@xmath0   ( complex c proper ) and @xmath25 km s@xmath0   ( high - velocity ridge ) . in these figures ,",
    "the color scale and thin contours reflect @xmath4 ( ) according to the scale at the bottom .",
    "the last thin contour is drawn at the 3@xmath26 limit of the lds , @xmath4 ( ) = @xmath27 @xmath18 .",
    "the thick line shows the @xmath28 @xmath18 contour from the more sensitive hulsbosch & wakker map in figure  [ hw_map21 cm ] integrated over the same velocity range .",
    "much of the high - velocity emission detected closer to the plane in figures  [ hw_map21cm]-[lds_compc ] is mainly associated with the outer arm and the warp of the outer milky way ( wakker 2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "a potentially serious source of systematic error in hvc abundance measurements is the large beam of the 21 cm observations usually used to estimate @xmath4 ( ) . the large radio beam may dilute the hvc 21 cm emission , or it may show emission from gas which is in the radio beam but is not present along the pencil beam to the uv source .",
    "comparisons of @xmath4 ( ) measurements from different radio telescopes ( with different beam sizes ) indicate that the 10 effelsberg beam is often sufficiently small to provide a reliable column density ( wakker et al .",
    "2001 ) , but there are cases where even the effelsberg beam is too large ( e.g. , mrk 205 , see wakker 2001 ) .",
    "therefore it is worthwhile to review the available @xmath4 ( ) measurements for the 3c 351 hvcs .",
    "the hvc 21 cm emission profiles in the direction of 3c 351 observed with the nrao 43 m telescope ( murphy , sembach , & lockman 2002 ) and the effelsberg 100 m telescope ( wakker et al .",
    "2001 ) are shown in figure  [ prof21 ] .",
    "column densities in the 3c 351 hvcs derived from these data are summarized in table  [ hi21 ] along with @xmath4 ( ) from the lds data .",
    "the uncertainties listed in table  [ hi21 ] are statistical errors only .",
    "wakker et al .",
    "( 2001 ) note that the systematic uncertainties in the 3c 351 column densities are likely much larger than the statistical errors : they estimate that systematic errors lead to an uncertainty of @xmath29 @xmath18 in @xmath4 ( ) . with this uncertainty , the @xmath4 ( )",
    "measurements in table  [ hi21 ] for complex c are in reasonable agreement . for complex c , we adopt @xmath4 ( ) from the smallest - beam observation ( effelsberg ) , but with the larger systematic uncertainty reported by wakker et al . , i.e. , @xmath4 ( ) = @xmath30 @xmath18",
    "however , while both complex c proper and the high - velocity ridge are apparent in the nrao and lds data , only complex c is clearly detected in the effelsberg observation .",
    "this suggests that the observations with larger beams are picking up emission which is not present along the pencil beam to 3c 351 .",
    "consequently , we take the nrao green bank @xmath4 ( ) as an _ upper limit _ for the high - velocity ridge , and we derive lower limits on the hv ridge abundances below .",
    "similarly , the column for complex c / k is highly uncertain given the systematic uncertainty above , and we can only place lower limits on the metallicity of this ivc .",
    "however , these lower limits will turn out to be useful (   5.3,5.4 ) .",

    "we now turn to the uv absorption line data .",
    "the stis observations of 3c 351 are fully described in  2 of yuan et al .",
    "briefly , the qso was observed with the e140 m echelle mode with the @xmath44 slit ; this mode provides 7 km s@xmath0  resolution ( fwhm ) and covers the 1150 @xmath7 1710   range with only a few gaps between orders at the longest wavelengths ( see woodgate et al .",
    "1998 and kimble et al .",
    "1998 for further details ) .",
    "the data were reduced following standard procedures with software developed by the stis investigation definition team .",
    "scattered light was removed using the procedure developed by the stis team ( bowers et al .",
    "1998 ) , which corrects for echelle scatter as well as other sources of scattered light .",
    "a sample of the final spectrum is shown in figure  [ oispec ] .",
    "this somewhat complicated portion of the spectrum shows the absorption profiles of the important milky way @xmath451302.2 and @xmath451304.4 profiles as well as several extragalactic absorption lines .",
    "absorption profiles of several species of interest are plotted versus lsr velocity in figure  [ stack ] along with the 21 cm emission observed in the direction of 3c 351 by wakker et al .",
    "( 2001 ) with the 100  m effelsberg telescope .",
    "the uv absorption lines show four distinct components .",
    "the two highest - velocity components at @xmath46  = @xmath47 and @xmath48 km s@xmath0  are close to the observed 21 cm velocities of complex c and the high - velocity ridge . similarly , the uv lines at @xmath46  @xmath49 km s@xmath0  are close to the velocity of ivc c / k .",
    "analysis of the complex c / k absorption lines is complicated by substantial blending with adjacent components .",
    "nevertheless , the data indicate that ivc c / k has a higher metallicity than hvc complex c (  5.4 ) .    in this paper , we are primarily interested in complex c and the high - velocity ridge",
    ". however , absorption from other galactic and extragalactic clouds can introduce systematic errors that must be considered .",
    "for example , 3c 351 has a dramatic `` associated '' absorption system ( i.e. , @xmath50 ) that affects the spectrum near the , , and lyman series lines at the redshift of the qso ( yuan et al .",
    "2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "the associated ly@xmath51 lines at @xmath52  = 0.3709 and 0.3719 fall near the galactic @xmath53 profile , which is a crucial profile for our analysis .",
    "we can predict the strength of these contaminating ly@xmath51 lines based on fits to the other lyman series lines in the stis spectrum from yuan et al .",
    "the thin solid line in figure  [ oispec ] shows the predicted ly@xmath51 lines superimposed on the fitted continuum .",
    "fortunately , as can be seen from figure  [ oispec ] , these associated ly@xmath51 lines have no impact on the high - velocity lines of primary interest .",
    "the nearby ly@xmath6 lines at @xmath52  = 0.0715 and particularly 0.0699 could be a more serious source of contamination than the associated ly@xmath51 lines .",
    "these ly@xmath6 lines appear to be mostly separated from the milky way and profiles , but since ly@xmath6  lines are clustered on velocity scales of a few hundred km s@xmath0  ( penton et al .",
    "2000 ) , it remains possible that unseen ly@xmath6  lines clustered around the strong @xmath52  = 0.0699 and 0.0715 absorbers affect the galactic and/or profiles in figure  [ oispec ] .",
    "however , a detailed comparison of the milky way profiles in the following section indicates that there is little or no contamination present in the and lines .",
    "the galactic @xmath54 transition is badly blended with @xmath55 absorption from a lyman limit system at @xmath52  = 0.2210 , so we do not use this transition for the hvc analysis . also ,",
    "the milky way @xmath56 and @xmath57 transitions are highly blended , and we do not trust information from either of these lines . finally , we note that the galactic @xmath58 and @xmath59 transitions are severely saturated and consequently do not provide useful constraints .",
    "to measure the line column densities and to assess the impact of unresolved saturation on the absorption lines of interest , we mainly rely on the apparent column density technique ( savage & sembach 1991 ) , but some supporting measurements are also derived from voigt profile fitting , using the software of fitzpatrick & spitzer ( 1997 ) with the line spread functions from the stis instrument handbook ( leitherer et al .",
    "the apparent column density is constructed using the following expression , @xmath60.\\ ] ] this provides the instrumentally broadened column density per unit velocity [ in atoms @xmath18 ( km s@xmath0)@xmath0 ] , where @xmath62 is the transition oscillator strength , @xmath45 is the transition wavelength ( the numerical coefficient is for @xmath45 in  ) , @xmath63 is the observed line intensity and @xmath64 is the estimated continuum intensity at velocity @xmath65 . by comparing two or more resonance lines of a given species with adequately different @xmath66 values ,",
    "the profiles can be checked for unresolved saturation and a correction can , in some cases , be applied ( jenkins 1996 ) .",
    "if the @xmath67  profiles of the resonance lines are in good agreement , then the lines are not affected by unresolved saturation , and the profiles can be integrated to obtain the total column , @xmath68    high - velocity absorption line equivalent widths and apparent column densities , integrated across the velocity ranges that delimit complex c proper and the high - velocity ridge , are summarized in table  [ lineprop ] .",
    "these measurements were made using the methods of sembach & savage ( 1992 ) and include continuum placement uncertainty and a 2% flux zero point uncertainty in addition to the statistical uncertainties .",
    "column densites of well - detected species determined from voigt profile fitting ( @xmath69 ) are also listed .",

    "the and profiles therefore indicate that there is a important difference in the physical conditions of complex c and the hv ridge .",
    "we discuss this issue further in the following section .",
    "we next consider the implications of the measurements presented above .",
    "we first argue that ionization corrections are important in the 3c 351 hvcs (  5.1 ) .",
    "we then investigate the absolute and relative abundances in complex c and the high - velocity ridge with the aid of ionization models (   5.2@xmath75.4 ) .",
    "in general , the logarithmic abundance of species x with respect to species y is @xmath147 = { \\rm log}\\left (   \\frac{n({\\rm x}^{i})}{n({\\rm y}^{i})}\\right ) + { \\rm   log}\\left ( \\frac{f({\\rm y}^{i})}{f({\\rm x}^{i})}\\right ) -   { \\rm log}\\left ( \\frac{\\rm x}{\\rm y}\\right ) _ { \\odot } ,   \\label{metlim}\\ ] ] where @xmath148 and @xmath149 are the column density and ion fraction of the @xmath150 ionization stage of species x ( and likewise for y ) , and ( x / y)@xmath10 is the solar reference abundance . in many situations ,",
    "the ionization correction @xmath151 can be neglected , e.g. , if @xmath152 .",

    "the last columns of these tables summarize the ionization - corrected abundances , using the ionization models described in the sections below . for the high - velocity ridge and ivc c / k , we list lower limits on the abundances because we only have upper limits on @xmath4 ( ) for these components ( see   [ sec21 cm ] ) .",
    "ionization corrections can be a large source of uncertainty ; we present examples below . the @xmath4 ( )",
    "measurements are often the other main source of uncertainty .",
    "we include our best estimates of the @xmath4 ( ) uncertainty in our abundance error bars . however , systematic errors in @xmath4 ( ) due to radio beam effects can be much larger than statistical errors , and these uncertainties can be difficult to assess .    if we neglect the ionization correction for the complex c absorption lines toward 3c 351 , we obtain highly discrepant results from neutral - gas tracers compared to species that can persist in ionized gas , i.e. , the different ions imply significantly different metallicities .",
    "for example , we obtain [ / ] @xmath153 and [ / ] @xmath154 vs. [ / ] @xmath155 , [ / ] @xmath156 , and [ / ] = @xmath157 .",
    "if correct , these abundances would indicate a very unusual relative abundance pattern .",
    "it is more likely that these discrepancies indicate that ionization corrections are important for the 3c 351 sight line .",
    "these abundance discrepancies are larger than the uncertainties in the respective measurements , as shown in figure  [ relabun ] . in this figure",

    "again , we see evidence of ionization effects in all three of these clouds : the neutral species and are significantly underabundant with respect to while ionized - gas tracers ( and ) are much closer to the solar pattern .        can we reconcile the various abundances by applying ionization corrections ? since we have reasons to believe that collisional processes may be important ( see  1 ) , and in order to make our development more clear , we begin with a simplified picture where collisional ionization equilibrium applies , with no additional photoionization from an energetic radiation field ( we will add photoionization in the next section ) . figure  [ collmod ] shows relevant column density ratios , as a function of temperature , derived from the equilibrium collisional ionization calculations of sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) with solar reference abundances from holweger ( 2001 ) and grevesse et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .. we have assumed that fe starts from fe  ii in the ionization ladder because any realistic radiation field will fully ionize the fe  i. ] the observed ratios in complex c are overplotted for comparison .",
    "we see that over the temperature range in which the / ratio is reproduced ( within 1@xmath26 ) , the model does not exactly match the other observed ratios ; departures from solar relative abundances are required .",
    "nitrogen , for example , must be made underabundant with respect to silicon by _ at least _",
    "@xmath158 dex ( an underabundance moves the model curves down in figure  [ collmod ] )",
    ". this may not be surprising since there is other evidence that nitrogen is underabundant in complex c ( richter et al . 2001 ; collins et al . 2003 ) , and nucleosynthesis in low - metallicity gas can result in n underabundances ( e.g. , henry et al . 2000 ) .",
    "similarly , figure  [ collmod ] indicates that aluminum must be underabundant if the gas is collisionally ionized and in equilibrium . like nitrogen , al could be underabundant , although much less so , due to nucleosynthesis effects since it is an odd - z element , as observed in low - metallicity galactic field stars ( e.g. , lauroesch et al .",
    "an al underabundance in the gas phase could alternatively be due to depletion by dust since aluminum is highly refractory ( e.g. , jenkins 1987 ) .",
    "however , this would be inconsistent with the iron abundance : should also be depleted in this case , but figure  [ collmod ] seems to require a slight fe overabundance , by @xmath90.2 dex , which leaves little room for dust depletion .",
    "the only puzzling implication of figure  [ collmod ] is , in fact , the fe overabundance .",
    "nitrogen and al underabundances would imply , at face value , that the gas is relatively pristine .",
    "however , in this case fe should be _ underabundant _ as well since iron is thought to be mainly synthesized on longer timescales in type ia supernovae .",
    "we note the profile is the noisiest measurement among the detected lines ( compare figure  [ navprofs]c to the other panels in fig .",
    "[ navprofs ] ) , and the observed / ratio is only 2@xmath26 above the model prediction at log @xmath159 4.2 . the slight fe overabundance may simply be a result of noise .",
    "in fact , we shall see below that when uncertainties in the reference abundances as well as the column density measurements are taken into account and ionization corrections are applied , the final abundances agree within 1@xmath26 , except nitrogen .",
    "however , it is clear that iron is not highly underabundant due to dust depletion or nucleosynthesis effects .",
    "we also note that murphy et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find a relatively high / ratio for complex c in the direction of mrk 876 . for figure  [ collmod ] , we assumed solar relative abundances .",
    "if we were to adopt overabundances of the @xmath160elements ( , , and ) by @xmath90.3 dex , on the grounds that such patterns are observed in low - metallicity stars ( mcwilliam 1997 , and references therein ) , then we would have a substantial discrepancy between the observed and model columns .",
    "for the calculation of abundances using equation  [ metlim ] , we present in figure  [ collion ] the ionization corrections obtained from the collisional ionization equilibrium calculations of sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) .",
    "the / ratio suggests that log @xmath161 4.20 ; taking the ion fractions from figure  [ collion ] at this temperature , with the column densities from table  [ lineprop ] and @xmath4 ( ) = @xmath162 @xmath18 , we obtain the following abundances for complex c proper : @xmath163_{\\rm c } = -0.76^{+0.23}_{-0.21},\\ ] ] @xmath164_{\\rm c } \\leq -1.37,\\ ] ] @xmath165_{\\rm c } = -0.73^{+0.20}_{-0.14},\\ ] ] @xmath166_{\\rm c } = -0.54^{+0.22}_{-0.17},\\ ] ] @xmath167_{\\rm c } = -0.88^{+0.21}_{-0.15},\\ ] ] and @xmath168_{\\rm c } \\leq -0.31.\\ ] ] the error bars in these abundances include the uncertainties in the column densities and the solar reference abundances but do not include the uncertainties in the ionization correction .",
    "_ we note that application of the ionization correction removes the abundance discrepancies discussed above .",
    "after the ionization correction at log t = 4.2 has been applied , all of the abundances agree within the 1@xmath26 uncertainties , with the notable exception of nitrogen .",
    "the implied metallicity is z = @xmath169 z@xmath10 .",
    "the nitrogen underabundance suggests that the gas has undergone relatively few cycles of metal enrichment from stars . _",
    "the magnitude of the nitrogen discrepancy decreases if we use the lower value for @xmath4 ( ) from @xmath67 integration ( see table  [ lineprop ] ) , and the best estimate of [ o / h ] decreases as well , by @xmath9 0.2 dex .",
    "however , since we only have an upper limit on @xmath4 ( ) , we would still be faced with a significant nitrogen deficit .",
    "it would be valuable to obtain additional observations of 3c 351 to more securely constrain the nitrogen situation ( see additional discussion in   [ pg1259met ] ) , and to measure the fe abundance with less noise .",
    "the combination of low overall metallicity and a nitrogen underabundance argue that complex c is _ not _ ejecta produced in a galactic fountain , which would produce gas with a higher metallicity .",
    "one might suppose that the hvc could still be part of a galactic foutain if during the foutain cycle the gas is substantially diluted with low - metallicity gas or if the fountain flow started at large galactocentric radii , as suggested by gibson ( 2002 ) . however , both of these hypotheses have trouble explaining the nitrogen underabundance , because n is not underabundant in the disk ism ( e.g. , meyer , cardelli , & sofia 1997 ) , even at larger galactocentric radii ( afflerbach , churchwell , & werner 1997 ) .",
    "it seems more likely that complex c has an extragalactic origin .",
    "it could be stripped gas from a satellite galaxy , or it could have a more distant origin .",
    "although there is strong evidence that collisional processes are important in hvcs ( see  1 ) , it is worthwhile to investigate how additional photoionization could alter the observed column densities .",
    "in addition , it remains possible that the h@xmath6 emission and high - ion absorption arise from a collisionally ionized phase ( e.g. , an interface on the surface of the hvc ) while the low ionization lines originate inside the cloud where the gas is mainly photoionized .",
    "for this purpose , we have constructed photoionization models using cloudy ( v94.0 ; ferland et al .",
    "the character of the radiation field to which an hvc is exposed is not entirely clear .",
    "this depends on the location of the hvc and the fraction of the ionizing photons that escape from the galactic disk ( weiner et al . 2002 ;",
    "bland - hawthorn & maloney 2002 ) .",
    "however , the extragalactic uv background from quasars and active galactic nuclei provides a floor ; additional photons from local sources only add to this background .",
    "consequently , we begin with the uv background from qsos+agns only .",
    "we model the complex c absorber as a plane - parallel , constant - density slab exposed to the qso background at @xmath170 from haardt & madau ( 1996 ) with @xmath171 ergs s@xmath0 @xmath18 hz@xmath0 sr@xmath0 at 1 rydberg ( see weymann et al .",
    "2001 and references therein for observational constraints on the uv background intensity ) .",
    "the absorber thickness is adjusted to reproduce the observed @xmath4 ( ) , and the metallicity and ionization parameter @xmath172 (= h ionizing photon density / total h number density ) are varied to match the metal column densities .",
    "it is important to note that the column is high enough so that self - shielding effects are important .",
    "these models should not be simply scaled for use on higher ( or lower ) @xmath4 ( ) absorption systems .    of course , these models are necessarily simplified compared to a real absorption system . however , a more detailed treatment of radiation transfer , geometry , and multiphase effects in the model presented by kepner et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in the end predicts very similar column densities to an analogous cloudy model . while this is only one test case , and more detailed modeling",
    "is highly warranted , the good agreement with cloudy is encouraging .",
    "figure  [ cloudymd ] shows the metal column densities predicted by the cloudy model as a function of @xmath172 , and figure  [ cloudyion ] shows the corresponding ionization corrections from the same model over the same ionization parameter range .",
    "the best fit is obtained with log @xmath173 , as shown in figure  [ cloudymd ] . at this value of @xmath172 ,",
    "the derived abundances are nearly identical to those derived above from the collisional ionization model .",
    "the only substantial difference between the photoionized and collisionally ionized models is for nitrogen . in the collisionally ionized model , all of the ionization correction factors of interest decrease as @xmath174 increases and",
    "the gas becomes more highly ionized ( see figure  [ collion ] ) . in the photoionized model , on the other hand , the n ionization correction increases while the other ionization corrections decrease as the gas becomes more highly ionized ( see figure  [ cloudyion ] ) ; this is due to the relatively high photoionization cross section of",
    "this reduces the nitrogen underabundance implied by the measurements somewhat compared to the collisional model .",
    "however , the best - fitting photoionized model still suggests an n underabundance : we find [ n / h]@xmath175 vs. [ o / h]@xmath176 if we take the lower @xmath4 ( ) from direct integration ( see table  [ lineprop ] and  [ secmeas ] ) , then the best fit is obtained with a somewhat higher ionization parameter , log @xmath177 ( log @xmath178 ) . as in the collisionally ionized model",
    ", this requires a lower [ o / h ] by @xmath179 dex , and the nitrogen deficiency is reduced .",
    "the iron problem is also present in the photoionized calculation : if we make @xmath180elements overabundant in the model , then we find that the observed @xmath4 ( ) is substantially greater than the predicted column density .",
    "this would be unexpected in low - metallicity gas , especially if nitrogen is underabundant .",
    "the similarity of the photoionization and collisional ionization results is not necessarily surprising .",
    "cloudy includes collisional processes .",
    "the gas temperature in the photoionization model is governed by the balance of photoheating and various sources of cooling , and with the right combination of temperature and density , the collisional processes may dominate .",
    "the different behavior of n in the photoionized vs. collisionally ionized models is also not surprising .",

    "photo_ionized than most species , and is a sensitive indicator of partially ionized gas ( sofia & jenkins 1998 ) .",
    "we experimented with other radiation fields in the photoionization model with various amounts of stellar flux added to the qso background , and we found that the low - ion results did not change dramatically .",
    "the low - ion column density ratios in complex c proper and the high - velocity ridge are strikingly alike ( see figures  [ navprofs]-[relabun ] and table  [ lineprop ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the physical conditions and abundances in complex c and the hvr are quite similar . as discussed in  2 ,",
    "the column in the high - velocity ridge is not securely measured , but if we take the green bank measurement in table  [ hi21 ] as an upper limit on the hvr @xmath4 ( ) , we obtain [ o / h]@xmath181 @xmath182 ( the ionization correction should have little effect on this [ o / h ] estimate , as shown in figures  [ collion ] and [ cloudyion ] ) . this is consistent with the absolute metallicity derived for complex c. however , the hv ridge contains substantially more highly ionized gas relative to the lower ionization stages . at the gas temperature and/or ionization parameter implied by the low - ion ratios in the hvr , and have very small ion fractions and",
    "should be undetectable ( see table 5 in sutherland & dopita 1993 and figure  [ cloudymd ] ) .",
    "consequently , we conclude that the significant high ion absorption lines observed in the high - velocity ridge originate in a separate phase from the low ionization stages .",
    "the similar component structure of the low and high ions in the hvr ( see figure  [ stack ] and figure  [ navprofs]e - f ) suggests that there is some association between the low - ionization and high - ionization phases ; this could occur if the high ions arise in an interface between the low ion - bearing gas and a hotter ambient medium .",
    "the absorption - line measurements for the ivc c / k are substantially more uncertain than the hvc measurements due to line saturation and blending with adjacent components .",
    "nevertheless , the 3c 351 spectrum indicates that c / k has a higher metallicity than complex c proper and the hv ridge .",
    "the equivalent widths and column densities are significantly higher in the c / k component than in the high - velocity components ( compare tables  [ lineprop ] and [ ivcprop ] ) despite the fact that the column is lower in c / k than in complex c. adopting the column from profile fitting ( which provides better compensation for blending and saturation ) and taking @xmath4 ( ) @xmath183 @xmath18 ( see   [ sec21 cm ] ) , we find that [ o / h]@xmath184 . as we have shown in the previous sections , ionization corrections are likely to be important for the other species detected in c / k .",

    "why do the sight lines to 3c 351 and pg1259 + 593 have such starkly different implications regarding the size and confinement of the absorber ? we propose a simple answer : complex c is probably interacting with the thick disk / lower halo of the milky way much more vigorously in the direction of 3c 351 than in the direction of pg1259 + 593 .",
    "this would occur naturally if the 3c 351 pencil beam is near the leading edge of the hvc , and this would explain several observations .",

    "such a transition is expected at the leading edge of a cloud moving through an ambient halo ( e.g. , quilis & moore 2001 ) .",
    "second , ram pressure could separate the baryons from the underlying dark matter ( quilis & moore 2001 ) and thereby alleviate the confinement problem discussed above . in this case",
    "there is no compelling requirement to confine the gas ; this edge of the cloud would be rapidly evaporating as it plunges toward the disk .",
    "third , observations of nine sight lines through complex c reported by sembach et al .",

    "[ o6h1map ] , an even more pronounced trend is evident in the @xmath4()/@xmath4 ( ) ratio in complex c. this ratio increases steadily with decreasing longitude and latitude , and the lowest - longitude complex c sight line ( mrk 501 ; see table 8 in sembach et al .",
    "2002 ) has an @xmath4()/@xmath4 ( ) ratio which is @xmath943 times larger than the ratio measured toward the highest - longitude sight line ( pg1259 + 593 ) .",
    "this trend also suggests that the lower - longitude section of complex c is more strongly interacting with the ambient medium ; as the gas is ionized to a greater degree , @xmath4 ( ) will decrease while @xmath4 ( ) increases .",
    "the lower - longitude region is also at lower latitude , so this result is not surprising : as the hvc approaches the plane of the milky way , it is becoming more fully ionized and is probably ablating and dissipating , and the trailing ( higher - longitude ) portion of the cloud has not yet entered the higher density region of the ambient medium where the interactions are more vigorous , or at least has not suffered the effects of ablation for the same duration as the lower latitude / longitude regions .",
    "an alternative to the interpretation presented above is that gas flowing up out of the disk ( e.g. , galactic fountain / chimney gas ) is colliding with complex c at lower longitudes and latitudes , and the resultant shock - heating is ionizing and evaporating the cloud .",
    "gibson et al . ( 2001 ) and collins et al . (",
    "2002 ) have suggested that such interactions might be required to explain the metallicity variations observed in the hvc ( but see point 1 in  [ pg1259met ] ) . in this regard ,",
    "it is interesting to compare the 3c 351 to the h1821 + 643 sight line , which is near 3c 351 but closer to the plane ( see figures  [ hw_map21cm]-[lds_hvr ] ) .",

    "however , we have shown in   [ secabun ] that ionization corrections must not be neglected when @xmath4 ( ) is at the level observed toward h1821 + 643 .",
    "when ionization corrections are applied , the observed columns can be reconciled with a lower overall metallicity and smaller n underabundances .",
    "figure  [ cloudy1821 ] shows a cloudy model in satisfactory agreement with the observed columns with @xmath293 and only small underabundance of n and al .",
    "the model shown in figure  [ cloudy1821 ] works if @xmath4 ( ) is close to the value from direct integration , i.e. , @xmath4 ( ) @xmath294 14.7 .",
    "higher column densities would require higher metallicity , lower ionization parameters ( to match , e.g. , the / ratio ) , and greater nitrogen underabundances , as can be seen from figure  [ cloudy1821 ] .",
    "a slight depletion of fe might also be required in higher metallicity models .",
    "due to the large range of @xmath172 allowed by the current data , we can not usefully bracket the size of the absorber at @xmath295 km s@xmath0 .    at this juncture , it remains possible that the outer arm high - velocity gas and complex c have similar metallicities , but the data also allow the outer arm to have a substantially higher metallicity than complex c if n is underabundant .",
    "consequently , it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about the relationship between the outer arm and complex c. weaker lines in the _ fuse _ bandpass may help to more tightly constrain the metallicity of the outer arm and thereby clarify this relationship .    _",

    "_ finally , it is interesting to compare the 3c 351 and h1821 + 643 sight lines at the velocity of the hvr component , @xmath296 km s@xmath0 .",
    "while the hvr absorption is clearly detected in a variety of transitions toward 3c 351 , most of the h1821 + 643 profiles show nothing at this velocity ( the profiles in panel ( e ) of figure  [ h1821compare ] show the contrast between the sight lines at this @xmath65 )",

    "these measurements have useful implications .",
    "the fact that @xmath4 ( ) @xmath301 @xmath4 ( ) toward h1821 + 643 would indicate that @xmath302 k if the gas were collisionally ionized and in equilibrium ( see , e.g. , figure 7 in tripp & savage 2000 ) .",

    "figure  [ c4fit ] shows our voigt - profile fit to the hvr features in the h1821 + 643 spectrum ; a single component with @xmath303 provides an excellent fit .",
    "this implies that @xmath304 k. the line width is only marginally consistent with the / ratio given the uncertainties in @xmath4 ( ) and @xmath305 ( ) .",
    "it seems more likely that either ( 1 ) much of the absorption is not associated with the -bearing gas ( in which case the -gas must be relatively hot to satisfy the lower limit on / ) , or ( 2 ) the gas is not in ionization equilibrium .",
    "the different centroids of the and lines ( see table  [ hvr1821prop ] ) support the idea that at least some of the originates in different gas .",
    "it is unlikely that the + gas is photoionized because of the long pathlengths required ( e.g. , sembach et al .",
    "2002 ) , but it is possible that the gas is collisionally ionized but out of equilibrium because it is cooling faster than it can recombine ( edgar & chevalier 1986 ) .",
    "heckman et al . (",
    "2002 ) have recently shown that a non - equilibrium , radiatively cooling gas model provides a good fit to the column densities and @xmath306values in hvcs ( as well as other contexts ) .",
    "their model also predicts @xmath4 ( ) @xmath301 @xmath4 ( ) , as observed in the @xmath307 km s@xmath0 feature toward h1821 + 643 .",
    "savage et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have noted that @xmath308 km s@xmath0 is near the expected velocity for distant milky way gas in a corotating disk / halo in the direction of h1821 + 643 ; the velocity would then imply a large galactocentric distance ( see their figure 2 ) .",
    "however , it is quite possible that this high - velocity feature is associated with the high - velocity ridge observed toward 3c 351 and other sight lines . in this case",
    ", the fact that the feature is only detected in and would indicate that the hvr has an extended ionized periphery .",
    "evidence for highly - ionized layers on the surface of hvcs has been reported for other clouds ( e.g. , sembach et al .",
    "we have argued that the absorption lines toward 3c 351 indicate that the hvr and complex c proper are related .",
    "if the @xmath309 km s@xmath0 component toward h1821 + 643 is also part of the hvr , then this gas is likely much closer than implied by its velocity and the assumption that it is corotating ( various arguments suggest that complex c is @xmath910 kpc from the sun ) .",
    "we have investigated the physical structure , conditions , metallicity , and nature of the high - velocity cloud complex c using high - resolution recordings of absorption lines in several directions through the cloud .",
    "our study is mainly based on stis echelle spectroscopy of 3c 351 , which shows a wide variety of absorption lines from complex c proper ( @xmath310 km s@xmath0 ) as well as an intermediate - velocity cloud ( c / k , @xmath311 km s@xmath0 ) and a higher - velocity component that we refer to as the high - velocity ridge ( @xmath312 km s@xmath313 ) .",
    "we also make use of other sight lines through complex c from the literature as well as new stis echelle observations of h1821 + 643 , which is just outside the 21 cm boundary of complex c but shows absorption lines at very similar velocities to those seen toward 3c 351 . from our analysis",
    ", we reach the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "the high - velocity ridge is closely related to complex c proper .",
    "this is suggested by the similar morphologies of the hvr and complex c ; the hvr has a similar shape and is roughly centered on the larger , lower - velocity complex c. this idea is supported by the absorption lines , which show remarkably similar column density ratios in the hvr and complex c. however , very little high - ion absorption is detected at the velocity of complex c proper , but , , and absorption is strong and easily detected in the hvr .",
    "moreover , the high - ion absorption lines in the hvr have centroids and line widths that are similar to those of the low ions in the hvr .",
    "we show that the high and low ionization stages in the hvr can not arise in the same phase , and we conclude that the high ion absorption occurs in an interface between the low - ionization phase and a hotter ambient medium .",
    "the relative abundances in all components with @xmath4 ( ) @xmath314 @xmath18 indicate that ionization corrections are important .",
    "we consider collisional ionization equilibrium as well as cloudy photoionization models to derive ionization corrections , and we find in both cases that @xmath315 in complex c in the direction of 3c 351 .",
    "we also find that nitrogen must be underabundant toward 3c 351 .",
    "the low metallicity and nitrogen underabundance indicate that complex c is not ejecta generated in a galactic fountain .",
    "it seems more likely that complex c is either tidally stripped material from a satellite galaxy ( analogous to the magellanic stream ) , or that it is gas with a more distant extragalactic origin .",
    "the absolute metallicity of the 3c 351 hvr component is less constrained because we only have an upper limit on the hvr column .",
    "the lower limits on the hvr metallicity are consistent with the metallicity derived for complex c proper .",
    "we find similar oxygen abundances at complex c velocities toward mrk 279 , mrk 817 , and pg1259 + 593 . while there is some dispersion in the [ o / h ] measurements , within the current uncertainties the measurements are fully consistent with a constant metallicity throughout the hvc .",
    "these sight lines as well as the mrk 876 sight line also provide strong evidence of n underabundances in complex c. comparison of the nitrogen abundances toward mrk 876 and pg1259 + 593 provides the strongest evidence of spatial abundance variability in complex c , but this requires confirmation with additional measurements .",
    "there are hints of @xmath180element overabundances in some directions , but the evidence is not statistically significant .",
    "the derived iron abundances indicate that complex c contains little or no dust .",
    "5 .   toward 3c 351 ,",
    "the complex c absorber size , density , and temperature implied by the ionization models indicate that the gas is not gravitationally confined , while toward other sight lines such as pg1259 + 593 , the implied path length through complex c is much larger and gravitational confinement is viable",
    ". pressure confinement by an external medium may play a role .",
    "however , we suggest that the 3c 351 sight line passes through the leading edge of complex c , which has been ablating and dissipating as it approaches the plane of the milky way . this idea is supported by observations , which show the highest column densities near the 3c 351 sight line .",
    "furthermore , the / ratio increases dramatically with decreasing longitude and latitude within complex c , which also suggests that the lower longitude and latitude regions are interacting more vigorously with the ambient medium .",
    "6 .   to look for evidence of outflowing milky way gas that might interact with complex c",
    ", we compare the stis echelle observations of the sight lines to 3c 351 and h1821 + 643 , which are both near the lower - latitude edge of complex c at @xmath316 .",
    "we find that the intermediate - velocity gas observed toward both of these qsos likely has a higher metallicity and may indeed be a fountain / chimney outflow from the perseus spiral arm . unfortunately , the results are less clear for the high - velocity gas toward h1821 + 643",
    ". the h1821 + 643 hvc could have a similar metallicity to that derived for complex c , or it could have a much higher abundance depending on the column and ionization correction , both of which are highly uncertain .    as usual , we are grateful to gary ferland and collaborators for the development and maintenance of cloudy .",

    "<S> we present evidence that high - velocity cloud ( hvc ) complex c is a low - metallicity gas cloud that is plunging toward the disk and beginning to interact with the ambient gas that surrounds the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> this evidence begins with a new high - resolution ( 7 km s@xmath0  fwhm ) echelle spectrum of 3c 351 obtained with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) . </S>",
    "<S> 3c 351 lies behind the low - latitude edge of complex c , and the new spectrum provides accurate measurements of , , , , and absorption lines at the velocity of complex c ; , , , and are not detected at @xmath1 significance in complex c proper . however , and as well as , , and absorption lines are clearly present at somewhat higher velocities associated with a `` high - velocity ridge '' ( hvr ) of 21 cm emission . </S>",
    "<S> this high - velocity ridge has a similar morphology to , and is roughly centered on , complex c proper . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity of the absorption lines ratios in the hvr and complex c suggest that these structures are intimately related . </S>",
    "<S> in complex c proper we find [ o / h ] = @xmath2 . for other species , </S>",
    "<S> the measured column densities indicate that ionization corrections are important . </S>",
    "<S> we use collisional and photoionization models to derive ionization corrections ; in both models we find that the overall metallicity @xmath3 in complex c proper , but nitrogen must be underabundant . </S>",
    "<S> the iron abundance indicates that the complex c contains very little dust . the size and density implied by the ionization models </S>",
    "<S> indicate that the absorbing gas is not gravitationally confined </S>",
    "<S> . the gas could be pressure - confined by an external medium , but alternatively we may be viewing the leading edge of the hvc , which is ablating and dissipating as it plunges into the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> column densities observed with _ fuse _ toward nine qsos / agns behind complex </S>",
    "<S> c support this conclusion : @xmath4 ( ) is highest near 3c 351 , and the / ratio increases substantially with decreasing latitude , suggesting that the lower - latitude portion of the cloud is interacting more vigorously with the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the other sight lines through complex c show some dispersion in metallicity , but with the current uncertainties , the measurements are consistent with a constant metallicity throughout the hvc . </S>",
    "<S> however , all of the complex c sight lines require significant nitrogen underabundances . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compare the 3c 351 data to high - resolution stis observations of the nearby qso h1821 + 643 to search for evidence of outflowing galactic fountain gas that could be mixing with complex c. we find that the intermediate - velocity gas detected toward 3c 351 and h1821 + 643 has a higher metallicity and may well be a fountain / chimney outflow from the perseus spiral arm . </S>",
    "<S> however , the results for the higher - velocity gas are inconclusive : the hvc detected toward h1821 + 643 near the velocity of complex c could have a similar metallicity to the 3c 351 gas , or it could have a significantly higher @xmath5 , depending on the poorly constrained ionization correction . </S>"
