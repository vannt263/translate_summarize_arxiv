    "out - of - equilibrium dynamics following a quantum quench is a topic of intense study at present .",
    "the theme is pursued primarily along two lines .",
    "the first one is about the equilibration and thermalization  mechanism of a quantum system @xcite , a fundamental yet still open issue in statistical physics .",
    "the second one is about the the real - time dynamical behavior of a many - body system @xcite , which is highly non - trivial in the regime where the quasi - particle picture breaks down .    among all the models investigated so far",
    ", the bose - hubbard model takes a special position . as a paradigmatic strongly - correlated model ,",
    "it can be realized accurately with cold atoms in optical lattices , and especially , the parameters can be controlled ( e.g. changed suddenly ) to a high degree @xcite .",
    "this nice property makes it an ideal candidate to investigate quantum quench dynamics both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "up to now , in the few theoretical works on the quench dynamics of the bose - hubbard model @xcite , the state of the system before the quench is always assumed to be the ground state of the initial hamiltonian .",
    "that is , the system is assumed to be at zero temperature initially .",
    "however , in this paper we shall start from a thermal equilibrium state .",
    "one should note that this scenario is actually more experimentally relevant . because in current experiments , one generally gets not a single tube of cold atoms , but instead a two - dimensional array of one - dimensional lattices for the cold atoms @xcite . in other words , an _ ensemble _ of one - dimensional bose - hubbard models is obtained in one shot .",
    "moreover , in view of the fact that the cold atoms are at finite temperatures necessarily @xcite , it is reasonable to start from a thermal state described by a canonical ensemble density matrix [ see eq .",
    "( [ rhoi ] ) below ] .    as emphasized by linden",
    "_ et al_.  @xcite , in the pursuit of thermalization , it is important to distinguish the two closely related but inequivalent concepts of equilibration and thermalization .",
    "the latter is much stronger and has the trademark feature of the boltzmann distribution , whereas the former refers only to the stationary property of the density matrix of a ( sub)system or some physical observables .",
    "it is highly possible that a system equilibrates but without thermalization .",
    "this is actually the case for the bose - hubbard model .",
    "as revealed both in previous works ( zero temperature case ) @xcite and in the present paper ( finite temperature case ) , the bose - hubbard model thermalizes only if the quench amplitude is not so large , at least at the finite sizes currently accessible .",
    "however , it will be shown below that in a much wider range of parameters , some generic physical observables equilibrate very well . among them",
    "are the populations on the bloch states , which are ready to measure by the typical time - of - flight experiment @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this is actually guaranteed for these quantities in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. , when the size of the system gets large enough .",
    "the equilibration behavior of the physical observables imposes a question .",
    "it is ready to recognize that the equilibration of the physical observables is largely an effect of interference cancelation .",
    "it never means that the density matrix has suffered any dephasing or decoherence .",
    "actually , the density matrix evolves unitarily and in the diagonal representation of the hamiltonian , its elements simply rotate at constant angular velocities .",
    "a natural question is then , does the time - dependence of the density matrix has any chance to exhibit it , given that it is almost absent in the average values of the physical observables ? this leads us to consider giving the system a second quench .",
    "the concern is , would the system yield different long - time behaviors if the second quench comes at different times ?",
    "it turns out that the answer depends on whether the intermediate hamiltonian is integrable or non - integrable . in the former case",
    ", the density matrix shows repeated appreciable recurrences and thus the dependence on the second quench time is apparent . in the latter case , on the contrary",
    ", the density matrix shows no sign of recurrence and quantitatively similar long - time dynamics is observed for quenches at different times .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , the setting of the problem and the basic approaches are given . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , the dynamics after a single quench is studied .",
    "the time - averaged density matrix and the real - time evolution of some physical observables are investigated in detail .",
    "based on the observation in this section , we proceed to study the scenario of a second quench in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] . finally , we summarize the results in sec .",
    "the time - dependent hamiltonian of the bose - hubbard model is ( @xmath1 throughout this paper ) @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the number of sites ( the total atom number will be denoted as @xmath4 ) and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for an atom at site @xmath7 .",
    "note that here periodic boundary condition is assumed . the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath0 are the nearest - neighbor hopping strength and the on - site atom - atom interaction strength , respectively .",
    "note that the dynamics of the system depends only on the ratio @xmath9 , thus we will set @xmath10 throughout .",
    "we say the system is quenched if @xmath0 is changed suddenly at some time from one value to another value .",
    "experimentally , for cold atoms in an optical lattice , this can be realized by using the feshbach resonance .",
    "assume that initially the parameter @xmath0 is of value @xmath11 ( the corresponding hamiltonian is denoted as @xmath12 ) , and the system is at thermal equilibrium and of inverse temperature @xmath13 . denote the @xmath14-th eigenvalue and eigenstate of @xmath12 as @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the initial density matrix of the system is then @xmath17 is the partition function and @xmath18 is the probability of occupying the eigenstate @xmath19 . note that @xmath20 is the dimension of the hilbert space @xmath21 .",
    "the density matrix at time @xmath22 is given formally as @xmath23 , with @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "here @xmath25 means time ordering .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath26 is invariant under the translation @xmath27 .",
    "this indicates that the total quasi - momentum of the system @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the creation operator for an atom in the @xmath30-th bloch state , is conserved .",
    "this property implies that if the full hilbert space is decomposed into @xmath3 subspaces according to the values of @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath32 , the hamiltonian and the density matrix are always block - diagonal with respect to the @xmath31-subspaces , i.e.,@xmath33 and @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "it is then possible to study the dynamics in each subspace individually ( which saves a lot of computational resource ) and then gather the information together ( note that for the expectation values of quantities like @xmath35 , there are contributions from each subspace ) . here",
    "it is necessary to mention that though we should have done the gathering or averaging process for many quantities studied below , we would rather not do so , because it is observed that the system behaves quantitatively similar in all the @xmath31-subspaces @xcite .",
    "a single @xmath31-subspace captures the overall behavior very well .",
    "therefore , our strategy is to focus on some specific @xmath31-subspace ( @xmath36 actually ) and take the normalization @xmath37 . _",
    "it is understood that in the following all hamiltonians , density matrices , eigenvalues , and eigenstates refer to those belonging to this specific @xmath31-subspace .",
    "we will drop the superscript @xmath31 for notational simplicity . _",
    "suppose at time @xmath38 the system is quenched by changing the value of @xmath0 from @xmath11 to @xmath39 , which is then held on forever .",
    "the hamiltonian later will be denoted as @xmath40 , and the eigenvalues and eigenstates associated will be denoted as @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectivley . in the representation of @xmath43 , the density matrix at time",
    "@xmath22 is then simply ( in this paper @xmath44 means quantum state averaging while @xmath45 means time averaging ) @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the dimension of the specific @xmath31-subspace .",
    "it will prove useful to define the time - averaged density matrix @xmath48 the time - averaged density matrix is of great relevance for our purposes .",
    "first , it is both time - independent and variable - independent . second , the time - averaged value of an arbitrary operator @xmath49 is given simply by @xmath50 .",
    "that is , the time - averaged density matrix contains the overall information of the dynamics of the system .",
    "actually , as we will see later , for some quantities which fluctuate little in time , the time - averaged density matrix tells almost a complete story .",
    "third , the process of averaging over time is a process of relaxation in the sense that the entropy associated with @xmath51 is definitely no less than that with the density matrix at an arbitrary time , i.e. , @xmath52 .",
    "this is a corollary of the klein inequality @xcite and is reasonable since @xmath53 contains all the information of @xmath51 while the inverse is invalid .",
    "the equality also means that @xmath54 will never be damped , and time - averaging is essential .    note that when @xmath55 , generally there is no degeneracy between the eigenvalues of @xmath40 . therefore the time - averaged density matrix is simply diagonal in the basis of @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath57 with @xmath58 being the population on the eigenstate @xmath59 . in the special case of @xmath60 ,",
    "the hamiltonian reduces to @xmath61 , with @xmath62 . in this case , each eigenvalue is of the form @xmath63 , under the constraints @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and there can be level degeneracy .",
    "however , we can always make some unitary transforms in each degenerate subspace to make sure that @xmath51 is in the form of ( [ diag ] ) .",
    "since the time - averaged density matrix provides an overall information of the dynamics of the system , we look into it first . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we consider the scenario of starting from the same initial condition ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) but quenching to six different values of @xmath39 @xcite . in each panel ,",
    "the logarithms of @xmath68 are plotted against the eigenvalues @xmath69 ( red dots ) .",
    "we have compared @xmath51 with a canonical ensemble density matrix @xmath70 , which is defined as @xmath71 under the condition @xmath72 .",
    "here @xmath73 , the final inverse temperature , is the only fitting parameter . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the green dots which form a straight line correspond to @xmath70 .",
    "we see that @xmath51 exhibits many interesting features . in the case of @xmath60",
    ", @xmath51 agrees well with @xmath70 throughout the spectrum . in the case of @xmath74",
    ", @xmath51 agrees well with @xmath70 in the lower part of the spectrum , while deviates from it significantly in the higher part of the spectrum .",
    "but overall the two are in good agreement since the weight of the higher part is small .",
    "the case of @xmath75 is somewhat the reverse of the @xmath74 case .",
    "it is in the lower part of the spectrum that @xmath76 fluctuates wildly . in the higher part @xmath76",
    "goes almost linearly .",
    "since the weight is dominated by the lower part , @xmath70 is not a good approximation of @xmath51 . in the strong interaction limits of @xmath77 ,",
    "another feature takes the place . as a whole",
    "the red dots do not fall close to a single straight line , but they do form some stripes , and the stripes are almost parallel with a common slope close to @xmath78 .",
    "it is easy to recognize that each stripe corresponds to a bump in the density of states of @xmath40 .    in order to understand the various features in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we rewrite @xmath68 as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a probability distribution @xcite associated with @xmath81 . note that @xmath82 is an intrinsic property of @xmath83 independent of @xmath78 .",
    "we have tried to characterize the distribution @xmath82 by its mean @xmath84 , its second central moment @xmath85 , and its third central moment @xmath86 , which are defined as follows ,    [ mean2 ] @xmath87    these quantities are presented in fig .",
    "these data enable us to understand fig .",
    "suppose for a distribution @xmath82 with @xmath88 , we define a gaussian distribution @xmath89 which shares the same mean and variance with @xmath90 but has vanishing third central moment . replacing @xmath90 in eq .",
    "( [ pm2 ] ) by @xmath91 , we get an approximation of @xmath68 , @xmath92 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , @xmath93 are represented by the blue dots .",
    "we see that as a whole @xmath93 is a good approximation of @xmath68 , except at the lower part of the spectrum in fig .",
    "the reason is clear ",
    "the @xmath94 s there are the largest throughout all the figures , which indicates that the corresponding distributions @xmath90 are wide and asymmetric and thus can not be well approximated with a gaussian distribution .",
    "now we can understand the good fittings in figs .",
    "[ fig1]c and [ fig1]d . in these two cases",
    ", @xmath84 is almost a linear function of @xmath69 , and @xmath85 does not vary so much , therefore the exponent in eq .",
    "( [ pmprime ] ) goes almost linearly with @xmath69 .",
    "the situation is similar in the higher part of the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , and therefore we have a good linear fitting for the higher spectrum part in fig .  [ fig1]b .",
    "in contrast , in fig .",
    "[ fig2]e , @xmath84 varies wildly for adjacent @xmath69 , therefore we see in fig .",
    "[ fig1]e large fluctuations about the straight line . as for the parallel stripes in figs .",
    "[ fig1]a and [ fig1]f , they are also understandable in terms of figs .",
    "[ fig2]a and [ fig2]f , where @xmath84 form parallel stripes .",
    "it is numerically checked and can be argued that the slopes of the stripes are almost unity .",
    "actually we have @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "note that in the limit of large @xmath97 , the kinetic term in the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) can be viewed as a perturbation to the second interaction term .",
    "the spectrum of the latter is highly degenerate and consists of integral multipliers of @xmath39 .",
    "the effect of the perturbation is to mix up the eigenstates of the interaction hamiltonian with different eigenvalues and smooth the spectrum .",
    "that is why there are bumps in the density of states in figs .",
    "[ fig1]a and [ fig1]f and two adjacent bumps are placed roughly @xmath39 apart . by perturbation theory , it is easy to show that the second term in eq .",
    "( [ slope ] ) varies on the order of @xmath98 among eigenstates belonging to the same bump .",
    "therefore , approximately we have @xmath99 for each bump and this explains why the stripes in figs .",
    "[ fig2]a and [ fig2]f are of slope unity . in turn",
    "it explains [ with the help of eq .",
    "( [ pmprime ] ) ] why we have the parallel stripes in figs .",
    "[ fig1]a and [ fig1]f , and especially the slopes are approximately @xmath78 .",
    "it seems in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that @xmath70 is a good approximation of @xmath51 only when @xmath100 is small . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we employ the tools of distance @xmath101 , fidelity @xmath102 , and relative entropy @xmath103 ( for the definitions see @xcite ) between two density matrices to quantify the difference or resemblance between @xmath70 and @xmath51 .",
    "there it is clear that only in the range of @xmath104 , we have @xmath105 , which means @xmath51 is close to @xmath70 . in the subsequent subsection",
    "we will see that only in this range the expectation values of some generic physical observables according to @xmath51 and @xmath70 agree well .     the distance @xmath101 and fidelity @xmath102 between @xmath70 and @xmath51 , and the relative entropy of @xmath70 with respect to @xmath51 , as functions of @xmath39 .",
    "the initial state is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig1].,scaledwidth=35.0% ]      we now proceed to study the time evolution of the system after the quench . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show the time evolution of the populations on the bloch states @xmath106 .",
    "the six sub - figures correspond to those in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] respectively .",
    "for all the @xmath39 s and all the @xmath30 s , @xmath107 equilibrate to their average values after a transient time , which is relatively longer in the cases of @xmath75 and @xmath108 . in the special case of @xmath60",
    ", there is no fluctuation at all .",
    "the reason is simply that in this case , @xmath109 are conserved .",
    "we see that the time - averaged values of @xmath110 predicted by @xmath51 ( @xmath111 ) and @xmath70 ( @xmath112 ) agree relatively well in the cases of @xmath60 and @xmath113 .",
    "this is consistent with the closeness between @xmath51 and @xmath70 for these two values of @xmath39 , as revealed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . here",
    "we would say the system thermalizes well in the @xmath74 case , however , we would refrain making the same statement for the @xmath60 case .",
    "the reason will be clear in the next section .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] is about a finite - sized system with some specific initial condition .",
    "however , here we have some general statements .",
    "we argue that in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath114 with @xmath115 fixed ) , as long as initially the system is at finite - temperature thermal equilibrium and described by a canonical ensemble density matrix as ( [ rhoi ] ) , we should see steady behaviors of the physical variables like @xmath109 .",
    "let @xmath116 and let @xmath117 .",
    "the ensemble - averaged value of @xmath118 at time @xmath22 is @xmath119,\\ ] ] where @xmath120 .",
    "its time - averaged value is @xmath121 here note that for a generic hamiltonian @xmath40 , there is no level degeneracy .",
    "the time - averaged value of @xmath122 is @xcite @xmath123 note that here it is assumed that there is no degeneracy of energy gaps .",
    "thus we have for the variance of @xmath124 in time , @xmath125 , @xmath126 since @xmath118 is semi - positive definite and bounded , we have @xmath127 .",
    "thus we have @xmath128 here we note that the summation is the square of the frobenius norm of @xmath53 in the representation of @xmath129 , which is invariant in all representations and is preserved by an arbitrary unitary evolution @xcite .",
    "explicitly , we have @xmath130    we argue that this quantity , which depends only on the initial state , decays exponentially with the size @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath131 increase with @xmath14 .",
    "we have @xmath132 as @xmath133 . here in the @xmath134 relation we used the fact",
    "the ground state energy @xmath135 of @xmath12 scales linearly with @xmath3 and so does the free energy @xmath136 of the initial state @xcite . the coefficients @xmath137 and @xmath138 are independent of @xmath3 . moreover ,",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath139 for any @xmath78 , with the equality taken only in the limit of @xmath140 or @xmath141 , and @xmath142 increases monotonically with @xmath143 .",
    "this makes sure that @xmath144 would not grow exponentially with @xmath3 and transcend unity .    with ( [ bound1 ] ) and ( [ bound2 ] )",
    ", we get an upper bound for @xmath145 , @xmath146 where @xmath147 is some constant .",
    "the upper bound of @xmath145 helps us determine an upper bound for the probability of finding @xmath124 deviating away from the mean @xmath148 by a distance larger than @xmath149 .",
    "actually , following reimann @xcite , using the chebyshev inequality @xcite , we have @xmath150 for a fixed value of @xmath149 , the upper bound decreases exponentially with the size of the system according to ( [ bound3 ] ) .",
    "it then follows the statement above .",
    "here some comments are worthy .",
    "though in the derivation above we have in mind a sudden quench , it is easy to see that the conclusion actually applies to any type of quench ( e.g. , the hamiltonian can be changed continuously over some period , as in @xcite , or quenched multiple times as in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] below ) , as long as after some point the hamiltonian is never changed again .",
    "the reason lies in that the frobenius norm of the density matrix @xmath54 is conserved under unitary evolutions , and thus is independent of the historical or the final values of @xmath26 , but is determined entirely by the initial state . as for the operator @xmath118 , only the properties of semi - positive - definiteness and boundedness are used .",
    "thus similar conclusions can apply to other operators such as @xmath151 and @xmath152 , or operators in other models .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that the conclusion relies on the fact that the quantity in eq .",
    "( [ fnorm ] ) is bounded by some exponentially decreasing function , which is the case only at finite temperatures ( @xmath153 ) . at zero temperature ,",
    "the quantity in eq .",
    "( [ fnorm ] ) is always equal to unity and thus the problem is still open .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that after a finite transient time , the physical variables equilibrate to their average values exhibiting minimal fluctuations .",
    "moreover , it has been proven that the amplitudes of the fluctuations will decrease exponentially with the size of the system .",
    "therefore , the observation is that the system , described by the density matrix @xmath54 , is almost indistinguishable from a system described by the time - averaged density matrix @xmath51 , as far as the simple realistic physical variables are concerned .",
    "this is remarkable .",
    "because though @xmath54 evolves unitarily and suffers no loss of information of @xmath53 , it behaves as if it were fully decoherenced .",
    "the question is then , to what extent can we hold onto this proposition ? is it possible to distinguish @xmath54 and @xmath51 , or @xmath154 and @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) , by some means ? motivated by this problem , we have considered the scenario of giving the quenched system a second quench .",
    "that is , after the first quench at @xmath38 which changes @xmath0 from @xmath11 to @xmath39 , at time @xmath157 , the system is quenched again by changing the value of @xmath0 from @xmath39 to @xmath158 , which is then held on forever .",
    "the concern is , would the long - time dynamics of the system depends on the specific time @xmath159 ?    denote the hamiltonian associated with @xmath158 as @xmath160 .",
    "the density matrix of the system later is given by @xmath161 ( for @xmath162 ) .",
    "as before , we are interested in the long - time averaged value of @xmath54 , @xmath163 since it has been shown and proven above that the dynamics of the system is to a large extent captured by the time - averaged density matrix . here",
    "the subscript indicates the dependence on the time @xmath159 .",
    "it is also useful to define the average of @xmath164 with respect to @xmath159 , @xmath165 the second equality means that @xmath166 is actually the time - averaged density matrix associated with an initial state @xmath51 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ def_bar_rho ] ) and ( [ diag ] ) ] and a hamiltonian @xmath160 .",
    "one purpose of defining @xmath166 is to set a reference state independent of @xmath159 .    to gain an overall idea of the dependence on @xmath159 of the long - time dynamics",

    "eight pairs of @xmath173 are examined with the same initial condition as in fig .",
    "we see that for all cases with @xmath55 , both @xmath101 and @xmath174 set down to their average values quickly . however , for the special case of @xmath60 , both @xmath101 and @xmath175 display repeated recurrences , without any sign of equilibration .",
    "the situation is the reverse of that in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where @xmath176 does not show any fluctuations in the case of @xmath60 .",
    "this phenomenon is due to the recurrence of the density matrix @xmath54 to @xmath53 @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ rhot ] ) , we see that in the representation of @xmath129 , the @xmath177-th off - diagonal element of @xmath54 rotates at an angular frequency of @xmath178 . in the generic case of @xmath179 , the energy gaps @xmath178 are quite random and incommensurate , and thus recurrence of the density matrix is rare .",
    "more precisely , the span between two times when all the matrix elements of @xmath54 get ( nearly ) in phase again is extraordinarily large . on the contrary , in the special case of @xmath60 , all eigenvalues and hence all the energy gaps @xmath178 are integral combinations of the few basic frequencies @xmath180 , and thus the probability of recurrence is much higher",
    "to demonstrate that the sharp peaks in figs .",

    "the system retains the memory of the initial state under the control of the hamiltonian @xmath40 . by contrast , in the non - integrable case , @xmath193 go over to their average values ( predicted by @xmath166 ) after a transitory period , showing little dependence on @xmath159 afterwards .",
    "combined with fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the picture is that @xmath54 evolving under the control of a non - integrable hamiltonian , not only yields the expectation values of @xmath194 as if it were @xmath51 , but even responds to the second quench as if it were @xmath51 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we have checked this picture by studying the real time evolution of @xmath195 with @xmath196 under the double - quench scenario .",
    "the eight figures shown correspond to those in fig .  [ fig5 ] respectively . for each pair of @xmath173",
    ", we have studied the evolution of @xmath197 for several different values of @xmath159 .",
    "we see that in all the cases with @xmath55 , as long as @xmath159 is larger than the transient time , which can be roughly read from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the later evolution of @xmath198 is quantitatively independent of @xmath159 . on the contrary , in the case with @xmath60 , the later values of @xmath199 vary wildly for different values of @xmath159 .",
    "here it is instructive to combine fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] and compare . in the @xmath55 cases , there is a sense of typicality @xcite .",
    "the density matrix @xmath54 governed by @xmath40 is surely non - stationary .",
    "however , for @xmath54 at different times , they yield almost the same expectation values for the observables , and moreover , they share almost the same response to the same quench . in the case of @xmath60 , what fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] reveals is a good complement to that in fig .",
    "it demonstrates that it is inappropriate to say that the system thermalizes in this case , even though the density matrices and expectation values of the observables agree  since according to one s everyday experience , a system in thermal equilibrium should not show any time dependence .",
    "we have studied the quench dynamics of the bose - hubbard model both analytically and numerically .",
    "the issues of thermalization  and equilibration are investigated thoroughly .    on the thermalization  side , which concerns whether the quenched system behaves like a canonical ensemble , it is found that this is the case only for small - amplitude quenches ( at least for the finite - sized system investigated ) .",
    "however , the time - averaged density matrix does manifest many interesting features in different regimes .",
    "these features are self - consistently understood after a study of the overlaps between the eigenstates of @xmath12 and @xmath40 . here",
    "we would like to say that it is urgent and would be very helpful to develop some analytical tools so that some general relations between the eigen - systems of @xmath12 and @xmath40 can be established .",
    "these tools and relations would also be useful to determine whether the non - thermalizationphenomenon observed is just a finite - size effect .    on the equilibration side , which is about whether physical observables relax to stationary values without appreciable fluctuations ,",
    "the result is that this is indeed the case for quantities as @xmath200 which are of most interest .",
    "moreover , it is proven analytically that for these quantities the fluctuations in time will decay exponentially with the size of the system .",
    "therefore , the overall picture is that generally the system equilibrates but without thermalization .",
    "the second quench reveals something more subtle .",
    "first , the subsequent dynamics depends or not on the second quench time @xmath159 according to @xmath60 or not .",
    "the underline reason is the recurrence or not of the initial density matrix , which in turn has its root in the eigenvalue statistics of the hamiltonian @xmath40 .",
    "this effect leaves us the impression that a non - integrable hamiltonian has more `` dephasing power '' than an integrable one .",
    "possibly it can be a tool to check the integrability of a hamiltonian .",
    "second , in the case of @xmath55 , it is found that the system described by @xmath154 responds to the second quench as if it were @xmath51 for @xmath159 larger than the transient time .",
    "this means that we can take the equilibration more serious@xmath154 and @xmath51 not only yield almost the same expectation values for the generic physical variables but also yield almost the same dynamics after a quench .",
    "moreover , the fact that the transient time is short indicates that the intermediate hamiltonian @xmath40 , which is non - integrable , is effective in `` dephasing '' the initial density matrix . in another perspective , the dynamics of the system is sensitive to the fluctuations of @xmath0 .",
    "this has the implication that in future experiments , accurate control of @xmath0 would be a necessity to interpret the results correctly .",
