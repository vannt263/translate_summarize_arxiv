    "v807 tau ( elias 12 , hbc 404 ) is a pre - main sequence ( pms ) hierarchical triple system located in the taurus star forming region .",

    "@xcite and @xcite identified the primary ( v807 tau a , elias 12 s ) as a k5@xmath0k7 classical t tauri star showing signs of an accretion disk , while the secondary ( v807 tau b , elias 12 n ) was identified as a m2@xmath0m3 weak - lined t tauri star with no evidence for accretion .",

    "we aligned the slit along the position angle of the ba@xmath0bb binary ; we also observed the a component separately in 2001 . in 2003 , 2006 , and 2010 , the slit was aligned along the a@xmath0b axis which was fortuitously similar to the ba@xmath0bb axis in 2003 and 2006 . in 2010 the close binary was separated by less than 30 mas and thus unresolvable .",
    "successful separation of the ba@xmath0bb components was possible only for the 2001 and 2003 data .",
    "nodding along the slit between sequential exposures by about half the slit length enabled removal of the sky background .",
    "exposure times ranged from 60 to 360 seconds ; because of the reduced throughput behind the ao system , nirspao spectra required longer integrations .",
    "the spectra were reduced and extracted using the redspec software package .",
    "the software performs background subtraction , flat - fielding , spatial and spectral rectification , and subsequent extraction of the spectra .",
    "the spatial and spectral rectification removes curvature distortions in order to produce straight spectral traces . for non - ao observations",
    "the dispersion solution and wavelength calibration were computed with respect to oh night - sky lines @xcite . as a result of the reimaged optics and reduced throughput in the ao mode ,",
    "the oh night sky lines in nirspao spectra are too faint to be used for wavelength calibration and the internal ne , ar , xe , and kr arc lamps were used instead . for the purpose of measuring radial velocities , only the spectra in order 49 were extracted and used in the subsequent analysis .",
    "in addition to atomic lines , this spectral region ( figure 2 ) contains molecular lines , most notably oh and h@xmath22o , suitable for characterizing m and late - k spectral types , and is free of terrestrial absorption features @xcite .    on most nirspao runs , resolved spectra of v807 tau a and b were obtained , however , v807 tau ba and bb were always blended because their separations were close to or below the diffraction limit .",
    "nonetheless , when the components were at favorable separation and the ao correction particularly good , the @xmath19 pixel@xmath6 scale of the detector in the cross - dispersion direction enabled us to extract individual spectra for ba and bb by fitting two gaussians to the spatial profile of the data at each pixel , and thus wavelength , across order 49 .",
    "we were able to extract unique spectra of ba and bb on 2001 jan 8 and 2003 dec 13 but were unable to separate the spectra from the later nirspao runs when the components were at smaller separations .",
    "the unresolved spectra are designated ba+bb in table  [ tab.nirspec_obs ] .",
    "we used our suite of nirspec spectral templates @xcite to identify by cross - correlation the template that best represented the spectrum of v807 tau a and to measure its heliocentric radial velocity and rotational broadening .",
    "we determined the best fit by varying the spectral template and the applied rotational broadening to produce the highest cross - correlation coefficient ; the radial velocity is given by the location of the peak .",
    "hr 8086 , a k7v spectral type star , gave the best fit for v807 tau a ; the measured heliocentric radial velocities and rotational broadening are listed in table  [ tab.nirspec_vel ] .",
    "the average value and standard deviation of the radial velocity , @xmath23 km  s@xmath6 , is a good approximation to the systemic velocity of the v807 tau triple pc distance of the taurus star forming region the projected orbital separation of the @xmath24 v807 tau a@xmath0b triple is about 43 au . assuming a circular orbit and total mass 1.5 m@xmath3 , the period is about 230 yrs , much greater than the orbital period of the ba@xmath0bb binary . ] .",
    "the small downward trend in radial velocity at a rate of @xmath25 km  s@xmath6 per year is consistent with the amount of orbital motion that would be expected between the wide a - b pair .",
    "the broadening of the spectral lines indicates that v807 tau a is rotating with a projected velocity of @xmath26 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "we applied the same analysis to the angularly resolved spectra of v807 tau ba and bb .",
    "we obtained the best fit to the ba spectrum with the template of gl 752a , an m2v spectral type star , rotationally broadened to 65@xmath070 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the result for bb is similar , the spectra are best fit by gl 436 ( m2.5v ) and gl 752a rotationally broadened to 60@xmath070 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the difference in spectral types of the two fits is not significant because the precision of spectral type determination is no better than @xmath1 one subtype .",
    "the spectral types are consistent with the determinations of the unresolved ba@xmath0bb binary from broadband photometry @xcite and the visible light spectrum @xcite . we were unable to measure consistent radial velocities of ba and bb using stellar templates , or consistent velocity differences between the radial velocities of ba and bb by using one spectrum as the template for the other .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty of these measurements as @xmath27 km s@xmath6 .",
    "we were also unable to measure consistent radial velocities of the unresolved ba @xmath28 bb spectra by two - dimensional cross - correlation with stellar templates .",
    "figure  [ fig.predrv ] shows predicted radial velocities versus phase of ba and bb and illustrates the difficulty in measuring their velocities .",
    "the predicted velocities were calculated using the orbital parameters and mass ratio @xmath29 = 0.843 in section  [ sect.orbit ] , systemic velocity , and 140 pc distance to the taurus star forming region .",
    "the predicted velocity differences are never greater than @xmath30 km s@xmath6 .",
    "it was not possible to distinguish such small differences in radial velocities of ba and bb given the significant broadening of their spectra .",
    "the observed templates used for the cross - correlation analysis are main sequence field objects while the components in v807 tau are young stars still contracting to the main sequence .",
    "hence , the pms stars will have smaller surface gravities by about 0.3 to 0.5 in @xmath31 .",
    "metal lines are weakly dependent on @xmath31 @xcite ; the line centers remain the same while the equivalent width of most lines decreases with increasing @xmath31 . therefore , the gravity dependence has no effect on our measurement of the radial velocities which are dominated by the location of the lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we detected a compact radio source in three of the six epochs of vlba observations . using the optical coordinates and proper motion of v807 tau in @xcite , we computed the location of the optical source during the times of the vlba epochs . assuming that the optical coordinates are dominated by the light from v807 tau a and using the relative positions of v807 tau a , ba , and bb from the adaptive optics images , we find that the vlba coordinates are consistent with the location of the close pair to within @xmath5 50 mas .",

    "we then applied the appropriate parallactic shift caused by a parallax of 7.14 mas ( using the 140 pc distance from kenyon et al .  1994 ) and added in the proper motion to compare the infrared positions with the motion observed in the vlba reference frame . during the two epochs with a detection of only a single source",
