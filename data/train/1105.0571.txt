    "many stars are observed to exhibit ` solar - like ' oscillations that are stochastically excited by near - surface convection ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",

    "solar - like oscillations have been detected on a number of main - sequence stars using multi - site ground - based spectroscopy @xcite and the recent high - precision photometric observations of the french - led _ corot _ space telescope @xcite .",
    "this has led to the first detailed asteroseismic studies of solar - like oscillations in main - sequence stars @xcite .",

    "* ) . however , this process is often time intensive and only appropriate for data above a certain signal - to - noise level .",
    "the average asteroseismic parameters , indicative of the global structure , are readily obtainable using automated analysis methods and can incorporate data with a lower signal - to - noise ratio for which a full peak - bagging analysis is not always possible .    in this paper , we compare the global asteroseismic parameters obtained from the analysis of 1948 f- , g- and k - type stars observed during the first seven months of _ kepler _ operations and carried out using the methods of nine teams .",
    "this incorporates all short - cadence observations of stars identified as potentially showing solar - like oscillations , which includes a number of giants and subgiants in addition to stars on the main sequence .",
    "we use simulated data to test the precision and accuracy of each method and develop a process to detect spurious outliers and ensure that data from different teams are self - consistent within the stated confidence bounds .",
    "the fraction of stars for which we can detect oscillations depends on the stellar parameters themselves and we correlate our detections with the parameters available from the _ kepler input catalog _ ( kic , @xcite ) .",

    "we had found that variations in the treatment of outlying data points and different methods used to interpolate missing points or remove long - term trends introduced a significant bias into the asteroseismic parameters obtained for each star .",
    "the prepared time series and corresponding power spectra were analysed to give estimates of the asteroseismic parameters sensitive to the global structure of the observed star .",
    "the most prominent feature of an acoustic power spectrum is the near - regular spacing between modes of the same angular degree and consecutive orders .",

    "it is usual to make the assumption that @xmath1 scales with the acoustic cutoff frequency @xcite , which when determined for an isothermal stellar atmosphere gives a scaling relation in terms of mass , radius and effective temperature of @xmath22 the height attained by a single @xmath5-mode profile is related to the intrinsic amplitude of the underlying stellar oscillation but is also affected by the lifetime of the mode .",
    "modes with shorter lifetimes have profiles with greater linewidths , spreading power over many frequency bins .",
    "if the power spectrum is converted to power spectral density by dividing by the frequency resolution , the intrinsic rms amplitude of a radial mode can be obtained as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the height of the underlying limit - spectrum profile , usually modelled by a lorentzian function , and @xmath25 is the corresponding linewidth . to obtain the intrinsic amplitude of non - radial modes",

    "[ eq : ampfromheight ] to account for the averaging of the oscillation eigenfunction over the visible stellar disk and the effects of limb darkening .",
    "the amplitude that would be attained by a radial mode with a frequency of @xmath1 we refer to as @xmath3 and reflects the excitation mechanism present in the star .",
    "if we assume an adiabatic stellar atmosphere , the value of @xmath3 , once corrected to a bolometric amplitude , is expected to scale with the rms velocity perturbation ( @xmath26 ) and inversely with the square root of effective temperature @xcite : @xmath27    the surface layers of a star introduce a significant frequency - dependent perturbation into the measured frequencies of @xmath5 modes ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "the modes of degree @xmath28 and @xmath29 are closely spaced in frequency and are therefore affected similarly by the surface layers .",
    "the small frequency separation between these modes ( @xmath8 ) is sensitive to the physical conditions in the deep interior and is therefore an important indicator of stellar structure , age and evolutionary state .",

    "kepler_-like time series each of one - month duration were prepared and analysed by six teams ( a2z , cor , kab , oct , qml , syd ) in a blind hare - and - hounds exercise .",
    "the stellar parameters were chosen to cover a range in values of @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath8 in accordance with the expected parameters of the stars showing solar - like oscillations in the _ kepler _ field .",
    "the values returned by the teams were compared with the input values of asteroseismic parameters for each simulated star to determine the bias , precision , number of outliers and accuracy of formal uncertainties for each parameter . due to the large variation of the parameters over the stars in the cohort , and the assumption that the inverse granulation timescale and width of the @xmath5-mode power excess both scale with frequency @xcite , we have assumed that the formal uncertainties scale with frequency also and therefore used relative uncertainties in our analysis .",
    "the histograms showing the relative deviations of each parameter from the corresponding input values across all methods are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : arthist ] .",
    "the simulated data were generated using realistic stellar - model frequencies as input parameters , thus the values of @xmath2 and @xmath8 for each simulated star vary with frequency .",
    "the comparison reference values of @xmath2 were determined using a cubic spline interpolation to the spacing of the seven radial modes in the vicinity of @xmath1 as a function of frequency , evaluated at @xmath1 .",
    "the reference values for @xmath8 were obtained in a similar way .",
    "however , the @xmath8 spacing , particularly for evolved solar - like oscillators , may not vary smoothly with frequency due to mode ` bumping ' caused by coupling with @xmath30 modes confined within the stellar interiors ( white et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "stars in the simulated set which did not have a smoothly varying @xmath8 spacing in the region around @xmath1 were not included in the @xmath8 comparison analysis .",
    "the analysis of simulated data showed that @xmath2 was the most precisely determined parameter .",
    "for the results of each method , we identified outliers as those points lying outside of a relative range of @xmath31@xmath32 from the true value .",
    "we used the median absolute deviation , scaled by @xmath33 assuming a normal distribution , for our estimate of @xmath32 to reduce the influence of outliers on our measure of the spread .",
    "the average relative number of outliers we found across all methods was @xmath34% , although this varied from @xmath35% to @xmath36% . with the outliers removed from the results of each method , the average standard deviation of the remaining distributions was @xmath37% and varied between @xmath38% and @xmath39% .",
    "we applied the t - test to the distributions and found that four ( out of twelve ) had centroids sufficiently far from zero that the null hypothesis ( mean is zero ) could be rejected at the @xmath40% level , hence indicating a small bias .",
    "the centroids of these distributions were all between @xmath41% and @xmath42% , indicating that any overestimation bias is at a level that is well within the expected @xmath35@xmath32 error distribution .",
    "these biases were not apparent in the later analysis of _ kepler _ data .",
    "the simulations showed that the spread in values of @xmath1 is wider than that for @xmath2 .",
    "the values for comparison were determined from the frequency at which the amplitude envelope of radial modes attained its maximum value . in the simulations , as in real stars , the non - radial @xmath43 modes have a slightly higher visibility than radial modes due to their increased spatial contribution when averaged over the visible stellar disk and the effects of limb darkening .",
    "the amplitude envelope for non - radial modes is assumed to peak at the same frequency as that for radial modes , however the determined value of @xmath1 may be sensitive to which modes are present in the region around @xmath1 .",
    "many of the methods use a wide smoothing filter in the power spectrum to minimise this effect .",
    "we identified outliers in the same way as for @xmath2 and found that the average proportion of outliers was @xmath31% , varying from @xmath35% to @xmath44% over the methods .",
    "once these outliers were removed , the average standard deviation of the remaining distributions was @xmath45% and varied between @xmath46% and @xmath47% . applying the t - test to the distributions indicated that three ( out of eight ) had centroids that rejected the zero - mean hypothesis at the @xmath40% level .",
    "the mean value of these distributions were @xmath48% , @xmath49% and @xmath37% , the largest of which corresponded to @xmath42@xmath32 .",
    "the presence of a bias in the estimation of @xmath1 may be due to the model used by each method to fit and remove the granulation background or the function used to fit the @xmath5-mode power excess .",
    "the methods that were identified as having a small bias in the analysis of simulated data were subsequently improved upon before the analysis of real data .",
    "the results obtained for @xmath3 showed a much wider spread than for @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "the relative number of outliers was slightly lower than for the other parameters due to the increase in the measured @xmath35@xmath32 spread of values , with an average of @xmath50% and varying between @xmath35% and @xmath34% .",
    "the outlier - removed mean standard deviation over all methods was @xmath51% , and varied between @xmath52% and @xmath53% .    by applying the t - test to each distribution ,",
    "the centroids of only one distribution ( out of eight ) was sufficiently close to zero to be consistent with the zero - mean hypothesis at the @xmath40% level .",
    "the other distributions had mean values between @xmath54% and @xmath55% , which indicated an underestimation bias in all cases except one . despite the presence of a bias , all of the methods showed a strong correlation between the values of @xmath3 determined and the simulation input values , with correlation coefficients between @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "fitting a linear relation to the variation of the determined @xmath3 as a function of the input values suggested that a simple scaling is sufficient to calibrate the amplitudes determined by each method .",
    "determining the maximum mode amplitude in an automated way requires assumptions to be made about the relative contribution of each mode degree to the amplitude per radial order ( _ e.g. _ the @xmath58 parameter in @xcite ) , the amount of smoothing applied to the power spectrum ( a wider smoothing window can reduce the amplitude of the @xmath5-mode power excess ) and also an appropriate contribution to model the stellar background ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "as each method addressed these problems in a slightly different way , the amplitudes they obtained were scaled differently from each other . to calculate a calibration factor for each method ,",
    "a linear regression was performed on the @xmath3 values from each team against the true values for the simulated data .",
    "the @xmath3 values were then scaled by this calibration factor before any further analysis .",
    "the relative deviations of the @xmath3 results from each method before and after the calibration was applied are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : amaxcorr ] .",
    "the values of the @xmath8 small separation were only determined by two of the methods ( cor , qml ) . repeating the same outlier detection procedure applied to the other parameters indicated that the relative number of outliers was @xmath59% and @xmath60% for these two methods .",
    "the average @xmath35@xmath32 spread in values of @xmath8 was the largest of all the parameters at @xmath61% , reflecting the difficulty with which one can precisely determine this small spacing in an automated way from data of just one - month duration . despite the wide distributions , applying a t - test found that both methods had distribution centroids that were consistent with the zero - mean hypothesis at the 95% level , indicating that no bias was present .",
    "the formal uncertainties of each parameter from each method were tested for consistency against the known deviations from true values using the @xmath62 test . in many cases",
    "the formal uncertainties were found to be inconsistent with the accuracy of the results . to obtain a @xmath62 per degree of freedom of unity for the parameters from each method would require scaling the formal uncertainties by a significant amount . despite this inconsistency ,",
    "the relative formal uncertainties were correlated with the relative absolute deviations of the results from their true values , particularly in the case of @xmath2 ( with a correlation coefficient of 0.30 ) and @xmath1 ( 0.29 ) .",
    "the formal uncertainties and relative deviations of @xmath3 were less strongly correlated ( 0.20 ) , however all of these correlations are sufficient to reject the null hypothesis ( _ i.e. _ random points with zero correlation ) at the 0.1% level . in the case of @xmath8 ,",
    "the stated uncertainties and deviations were not significantly correlated , however the sample size was relatively small because only two of the methods returned results on @xmath8 for the simulated stars .",
    "the prepared _ kepler _ light curves were analysed using the methods of all nine teams ( see table  [ tab : methods ] ) .",
    "the methods did not all detect oscillations on the same targets so there was some non - overlap in the sets of stars for which oscillations were detected by each method . in order to maximise",
    "the number of stars for which we obtained verified global asteroseismic parameters , it was desirable to combine the results from all methods rather than ranking them in some way and selecting only the best . the methods used previously to analyse the results from simulated data required knowing the correct parameters _ a priori_. in the case of real data we constructed alternative methods to detect outliers , calibrate the maximum mode amplitudes and test the consistency of formal errors .",
    "the results from the simulated data showed that for all of the parameters , there were significantly more outliers at @xmath31@xmath32 than might be expected assuming a normal error distribution .",
    "this is an indication that the error distribution is not solely random and has a dependence on the varying signal - to - noise ratio of the stars present .",
    "it also highlights the limitations of the automated analysis methods in cases where the signal - to - noise ratio of the data is low .    as a verification procedure",
    ", we required that for each parameter determined for each star the results from at least two independent teams were contained within a range of fixed relative size centred on the median value .",
    "results outside of this range were iteratively removed until either all results were in agreement or fewer than two results remained .",
    "the range needed to be small enough to reject outliers but not so small that results were removed due to the inherent scatter in the data .",
    "the range size for each parameter was defined using the results from the simulated data .",
    "we used the smallest range such that the outliers identified at the @xmath31@xmath32 levels described previously would also be detected using the fixed - range method .",
    "the relative ranges that we calculated were @xmath63% ( @xmath2 ) , @xmath64% ( @xmath1 ) and @xmath65% ( @xmath3 and @xmath8 ) .      to identify any significant biases in the asteroseismic parameters derived from _ kepler _ data , we compared the results of each method to those of a reference method ( syd-1 ) .",
    "as was the case for the simulations , the parameter with problematic biases was @xmath3 . in order to calibrate the amplitudes of each method , the maximum mode amplitudes of 22 high signal - to - noise stars within the cohort",
    "were determined using an established peak - bagging technique and used as a reference set to obtain @xmath3 correction factors for each method .",
    "the peak - bagging technique was tested using a subset of 48 simulated stars with high signal - to - noise ratios and found to give an unbiased estimate of @xmath3 to a relative precision of 6.2% . the relative differences between the @xmath3 values for _ kepler _ data determined by each method and that given by the reference method before and after calibration by the peak - bagging results",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : amaxcorr_real ] .",
    "this illustrates the improved agreement in the values determined for @xmath3 by each method after calibration .        in the case of real data , it was not possible to calculate uncertainty - scaling factors using the @xmath62 test without knowing the correct values _ a priori _ and so a method was devised to estimate these using the scatter in the results obtained for the same stars from multiple teams . for those stars where at least five teams gave results that were in agreement within the thresholds defined above , the standard deviation of these results was used as an estimate of the expected uncertainty .",
    "a scaling factor was then determined from the ratio of this standard deviation to the formal uncertainties stated by each team .",
    "single average scaling factors for each method were then calculated as the median of the individual scaling factors .",
    "the distributions of the uncertainty - scaling factors are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : errmult_all ] and the median values for each method are given in table  [ tab : medvals ] .",
    "the distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig : errmult_all ] are encouraging and show that once scaled by a single scaling factor , the uncertainties of each method agree well with the spread observed between results obtained from multiple methods .",
    "the error correction procedure ensured that the data were self - consistent within stated uncertainties , however there is an additional internal uncertainty which must be included . for a given star",
    "we expect the scatter in the results obtained from multiple teams to be less than a true measure of the uncertainty because all of the methods were analysing the same data .",
    "if we use the scatter by itself to calculate the correction factors then they will be underestimated . by estimating the uncertainty - scaling factors using the scatter method on the simulated data and then applying the @xmath62 test to check the consistency of the scaled uncertainties",

    "the scaling that must be applied to the formal errors to ensure they are consistent with multiple alternative methods is considerable ( see table  [ tab : medvals ] ) . for cases where this scaling is large ( _ i.e. _ greater than four )",
    ", the reliability of the scaled uncertainties is questionable .",
    "in addition to this , some of the methods did not calculate any formal uncertainties on their results . for these data ,",
