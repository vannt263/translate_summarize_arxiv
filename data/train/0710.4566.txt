    "it is well known that three - dimensional ( 3d ) conformations of peptides and proteins play an important role due to their biological activities . therefore , many theoretical and experimental studies focus on the determination of the 3d structure of these molecules . in a newly growing field of research ,",
    "synthetic peptides are investigated for use in hybrid nano - devices , depending on their self - assembly properties  @xcite . in these studies",
    ", it is also shown that the binding of peptides on metal and semiconductor surfaces depends on the types of amino acids  @xcite and on the sequences of the residues in the peptide chain  @xcite .",
    "these experiments reveal many different interesting and important problems , which are related to general aspects of the question why and how proteins fold .",
    "this regards , for example , the character of the adsorption process , i.e. , whether the peptides simply dock to the substrate without noticeable structural changes or whether they perform conformational transitions before binding .",
    "a related question is how secondary structures of peptide folds in the bulk influence the binding behavior to substrates . in helical structures , for example",
    ", side chains are radially directed and  due to the helical symmetry ",
    "residues with a certain distance in the sequence arrange linearly .",
    "this could have consequences for docking to a regular crystal surface , where the atoms are also arranged linearly along the main axes .",
    "this means that two peptides with the same content of residues , but different sequences , could exhibit completely different binding properties .",
    "this behavior was , in fact , observed in a recent experimental adsorption study of peptides in the vicinity of semiconductor substrates  @xcite , although other explanations for this kind of specificity are also conceivable . for these reasons ,",
    "it is likely that the binding specificity also depends on the thermodynamic and structural properties of peptides in solvent , as it has already turned out in investigations of minimalistic models  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on three synthetic peptides , aqnpsdnnthth , aqnpsdnntata , and tnhdhsnaptnq  @xcite , whose binding properties were investigated in recent experimental studies  @xcite .",
    "the second sequence is a mutated version of the first one , where the histidine residues ( h ) of the first chain are replaced by alanines ( a ) .",
    "the third sequence is a randomly permuted sequence of the first chain .",
    "it was shown in the experiments that the first sequence has a strong affinity to adsorb to gallium arsenide ( gaas ) , whereas the binding to silicon ( si ) is very weak .",
    "exchanging the histidines by alanines improves the binding properties to si , while the adsorption strength to gaas is noticeably reduced . for the randomly permuted sequence , the binding strength to gaas",
    "is left widely unaffected , while binding to si is as strong as to gaas .",
    "employing multicanonical ( muca ) monte carlo sampling  @xcite , we analyze single - molecule folds in the bulk and illuminate the thermodynamic and structural properties of these peptides .",
    "generalised - ensemble methods applied to all - atom descriptions of proteins have been very successful in the past , e.g. , in revealing the statistical mechanics in the folding process of small proteins  @xcite . for sequences with more than 20 residues , studies of thermodynamics and kinetics employing realistic physical models are computationally extremely demanding . for such systems , reduced all - atom models  @xcite or models at a higher coarse - grained level  @xcite could be , depending on the particular question , much more promising .",
    "coarse - grained lattice and off - lattice models allow for systematic thermodynamic studies and , at least partly , sequence analyses of heteropolymers with up to 100 monomers  @xcite .",
    "firstly , we have simulated all three molecules in vacuum .",
    "then , in order to see the effects of solvation , we have also performed extensive simulations of the commonly used surface - accessible area solvent model with oons atomic solvation parameter set  @xcite .",
    "the preferential properties of this parameter set compared to others were reported in previous works  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after the description of the peptide model and the computational methods used in this study in sect .",
    "[ secmet ] , we discuss in sect .",
    "[ secsol ] exemplified effects of solvation compared with results obtained in the vacuum simulations . in sect .",
    "[ sechc ] , we discuss in detail the helix - coil transitions for the three peptides in solvent by means of fluctuations of several energetic and structural quantities .",
    "section  [ secfree ] addresses the folding channels in the free - energy landscape .",
    "the paper concludes with a summary in sect .",
    "[ secsum ] .",
    "in our simulations a peptide is modeled with all of its atoms .",
    "each atom @xmath0 , located at the position @xmath1 , carries a partial charge @xmath2 .",
    "covalent bonds between atoms , according to the chemical structure of the amino acids , are considered rigid , i.e. , bond lengths are kept constant , as well as bond angles between covalent bonds and certain rigid torsion angles . distances between nonbonded atoms @xmath0 and @xmath3 are defined as @xmath4 and measured in  in the following .",
    "the set of degrees of freedom covers all dihedral torsion angles @xmath5 of @xmath6th residue s backbone ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) and side chain ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the model incorporates electrostatic coulomb interactions between the partial atomic charges ( all energies in kcal / mol ) , @xmath11 effective atomic dipole - dipole interaction modeled via lennard - jones potentials  @xcite , @xmath12 o - h and n - h hydrogen - bond formation , @xmath13 and considers dihedral torsional barriers ( if any ) : @xmath14 the total energy of a conformation , whose structure is completely defined by the set of dihedral angles @xmath15 , is @xmath16 the parameters @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are taken from the ecepp/3 ( * e*mpirical * c*onformational * e*nergies for * p*roteins and * p*olypeptides ) force field  @xcite , one of the most commonly used all - atom force fields . in all simulations the dielectric constant was set to @xmath19 , which is the vacuum value .",
    "@xmath20 is considered rigid at @xmath21 .",
    "we always used the trans down - puckering conformation of the proline ring . for the implicit - solvent simulations ,",
    "the model is extended by the solvation - energy contribution , which is given by  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the solvent - accessible surface area of the @xmath0th atom for a given conformation and @xmath24 is the solvation parameter for the @xmath0th atom . the values for @xmath24 depend on the type of the @xmath0th atom and are parameterized according to the suggestions given in ref .",
    "the total potential energy of the molecule then reads @xmath25 the described peptide model and the ecepp/3 parameterization is implemented in the software package smmp  @xcite , which we used for our study .    in table",
    "[ gemtable ] , we have listed the three sequences investigated with this model .",

    "= 8.6 cm    = 8.6 cm    = 8.6 cm    for the study of the helix - coil folding channels , it is useful to investigate the two - dimensional multicanonical histogram of the energy @xmath26 and a suitable system parameter , which is chosen here to be the angular overlap parameter @xmath27 , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eqov ] ) . as reference conformations , required for the calculation of @xmath27",
    ", we use the lowest - energy conformations found in the multicanonical simulations .",
    "these structures are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s1ref ] ( right ) for s1 and in fig .",
    "[ fig : s23ref ] for s2 and s3 .",
    "the multicanonical histogram is obtained from the multicanonical time series @xmath28 where the sum runs over the monte carlo steps @xmath29 .",
    "the summation over @xmath27 yields the `` flat '' multicanonical energy distribution . since the conformational energy @xmath26",
    ", if replaced by the average energy @xmath30 , is directly related to the temperature , the histogram @xmath31 contains sufficient information for the description of the simple folding transition . in fig .",
    "[ fig : histog ] , we have plotted the multicanonical histograms for the three sequences s1 , s2 , and s3 . in all three cases , we find a noticeable turn in the distribution from small values of @xmath27 , which correspond to random - coil conformations , to values closer to unity , where the conformations are similar to the helical reference conformation . in correspondence to the interpretation in the previous section , the transition is stronger for the wild - type and mutant sequences s1 and s2 , respectively , and rather a two - step process in the case of the randomly permuted sequence s3 .",
    "the remarkable bifurcations at very low energies are possibly indications for metastable conformations which can be considered as weakly disturbed reference conformations .",
    "it should be noted that the angular overlap parameter is calculated by comparing all dihedral angles .",
    "this means that deviations in side - chain dihedral angles lead to @xmath27 values different from unity , although the backbone dihedral angles could take almost the same values .",
    "helical structures are mainly due to cooperativity along the backbone , but differences in the precise side - chain locations do not destabilize the helical structures .",
    "therefore , these kinds of glassy transitions , which happen under extreme conditions ( very low temperatures ! ) are interesting but not in the main focus of this work .",
    "= 8.6 cm    = 8.6 cm    = 8.6 cm    in figs .",
    "[ fig : free](a)(c ) , we have plotted the free - energy landscapes for the three peptides .",
    "here , we assume that the angular overlap parameter @xmath27 is a suitable measure for the structural order of the peptides .",
    "the free energy as a function of this `` order '' parameter and temperature is then given by @xmath32 with the distribution of the overlap parameters @xmath33 where the integral runs over all possible conformations @xmath15 .",
    "the free - energy plots in figs .",
    "[ fig : free](a)(c ) confirm that all three peptides experience a conformational transition following a single main folding channel .",
    "although the helix - coil transition separates the pseudo - phases of random conformations and the long - range ordered helical phase , no noticeable signal of pseudo - phase coexistence is observed , i.e. , the transition appears rather second - order- than first - order - like .",
    "we have analysed thermodynamic properties and folding channels in the free - energy landscape for three synthetic 12-residue peptides which exhibit remarkable adsorption affinities to semiconductors  @xcite . employing an all - atom model based on the ecepp/3 force field  @xcite with oons implicit solvation parameter set  @xcite and applying the implementation of the multicanonical monte carlo simulation method in the smmp package  @xcite , we found in all three cases indications for a strong helix - coil transition .",
    "independent of the fluctuations studied , the peak temperatures are very close to each other  despite of the smallness of the peptides . since experimental verification and biochemical structural analysis of these peptides are still pending , a comparison with experimental data is not yet possible .",
    "our predictions for the transition temperatures are probably too high , as is to be expected by using implicit - solvent models .",
    "therefore , we expect that the helix - coil transitions could happen under reasonable environmental conditions such that it should be possible to verify our predictions experimentally . this is an important issue , since it is generally expected that selective synthetic peptides and polymers may play an essential role in future nanotechnological applications .",
