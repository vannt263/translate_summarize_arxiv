    "ten of them ( one is highlighted ) are shown in the bottom window in fig .  [ orades ] .",
    "the resemblance with the actual distribution , in the top window of the figure , is evident .",
    "second , i  have divided the survey area in nine regions : a central area , 10-arcmin wide , where the asymmetry is difficult to quantify , and eight segments of the annulus in the radius interval 10arcmin @xmath109 30arcmin .",
    "third , for each simulated distribution , i  have computed its corresponding asymmetry factor , @xmath9 , defined by :    @xmath110    where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the numbers of objects of the two most populated segments of annulus , and @xmath113 and @xmath114 are those of the less populated .",
    "the mean and the standard deviation of the 1000 computed asymmetry factors are @xmath115 , @xmath116 .",
    "the maximum and minimum asymmetry factors are @xmath117 = 0.1382 and @xmath118 = 0.0176 .",
    "the four values ( @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) are faultless compatible with the poissonian errors within each segment of annulus .",
    "finally , i  have measured the asymmetry factor for the actual @xmath0  orionis distribution : @xmath121 = 0.1853 .",
    "this value deviates 6.1 times the @xmath120 from the @xmath119 and is significatively larger than the @xmath117 among 1000 monte carlo simulations . considering as a first order of approximation that the values @xmath122 ( @xmath15 = 1 ... 1000 ) are distributed following a standard normal distribution with parameters @xmath119 and @xmath120 ,",
    "then there is a probability @xmath123 ( where `` erf '' is the error function ) that the actual value @xmath121 follows such distribution . even accounting for generous systematic errors or biases , it is highly probable that the radial distribution of objects at more than 10arcmin from the centre of @xmath0  orionis is azimuthally  asymmetric .",
    "the most populated segments of annulus of the actual distribution are , counting anti - clockwise from 12 hours , the second ( coinciding with the elongated subclustering in the direction to the horsehead nebula ) and the fifth ones . both two segments and the cluster centre spatially",
    "coincide with a filamentary region of maximum emission at the 12@xmath124 m _ iras _ passband ( see fig .  2 in oliveira & van loon 2004 ) .",
    "this `` warmer '' region has not been identified in works based on recent observations with irac and mips onboard _ spitzer _",
    "( e.g. hernndez et  al . 2007 ) or with the spatial infrared imaging telescope on the midcourse space experiment satellite ( kraemer et  al .",
    "2003 ) . from my data",
    ", i can not postulate whether the largest surface density of @xmath0  orionis objects originally arises from an hypothetical larger density of warm dust in the region or , inversely , the filamentary region is a consequence of both the low spatial resolution imaging capabilities of _ iras _ and the largest surface density of objects ( i.e. the red @xmath0  orionis objects , many with mid - infrared excesses due to discs oliveira et  al .",
    "2006 ; hernndez et  al .",
    "2007 ; caballero et  al .",
    "2007 , generate a smooth background at 12@xmath124 m that _ iras _ was not able to resolve ) .",
    "the accumulation of stars and brown dwarfs in a filamentary pattern in @xmath0  orionis strongly supports some star formation scenarios of collapse and fragmentation of a large - scale turbulent molecular cloud , especially those that predict burst of star formation in filamentary gas ( e.g. bate , bonnell & bromm  2003 ) .",
    "it is stimulating to notice that these simulations assumed the contraction of an isothermal , spherical molecular cloud with @xmath88 ( see section  [ surfacedensity ] ) .",
    "the filamentary accumulation in @xmath0  orionis is , however , peculiar , because no similar arrangements have been found in other star - forming regions .",
    "for example , gmez et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) and larson ( 1995 ) found that the subclustering in taurus - auriga is in the form of star clumps of @xmath115 components , while bate et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) showed that in the orion nebula cluster there is no subclustering at all .",
    "it is obvious that further investigations are needed ; percolation or two - point correlation function of stars are different approaches that can be  used .",
    "the @xmath13ma - old @xmath0  orionis cluster is a perfect laboratory of star formation .",
    "i  have investigated the radial distribution of 340 cluster members and candidates in a 30arcmin - radius area centred on @xmath0  ori  ab , taken from caballero ( 2007c ) .",
    "the analysis has covered a mass interval from the 18 + 12@xmath5 of @xmath0  ori  ab to the @xmath10.03@xmath5 of the faintest brown dwarf detectable by denis .",
    "the cluster shows a clear radial density gradient , quantified by the @xmath20-parameter , that accounts for the mean separation between members and the euclidean minimum spanning tree of the cluster .",
    "i  have calculated the functional relations between normalised cumulative numbers of objects counting from the cluster centre , @xmath32 , and surface densities , @xmath31 .",
    "cumulative distribution functions as these avoid many problems associated with binning . among the studied radial ( power - law , exponential and king ) profiles ,",
    "the best fit is for a composite power - law distribution of cluster members with a core and a rarified halo .",
    "the core extends up to @xmath120arcmin from the cluster centre and is nicely modelled by a surface density @xmath87 , that corresponds to a volume density @xmath88 .",
    "this volume density matches , in its turn , the radial profile in a cluster formed from the collapse of a self - gravitating , isothermal sphere .",
    "the most massive @xmath0  orionis stars deviate , however , from the general trend and are much more concentrated towards the cluster centre .",
    "there is also an apparent deficit of very low - mass stars and high - mass brown dwarfs ( 0.16@xmath125 0.035@xmath5 ) in the innermost 4arcmin and an excess in the annulus at 67arcmin to the central trapezium - like system .",
    "last , there is a significant azimuthal asymmetry due to a filament - shape overdensity of objects that connects the cluster centre with a part of the horsehead nebula .",
    "this discovery supports the formation scenarios that predict burst of star formation in filamentary  gas .",
