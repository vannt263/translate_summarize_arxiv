    "see , for example , @xcite . for a survey of the subject , see @xcite or @xcite . if one examines the mandelbrot set over a @xmath4-adic field , one finds the object to be much less inspiring .",
    "for any prime @xmath4 , the @xmath4-adic mandelbrot set for quadratic polynomials as defined above , replacing @xmath10 with @xmath11 , is simply the unit disk .",
    "but when we consider an analogous set for polynomials of higher degree , the @xmath4-adic mandelbrot set for @xmath7 can have a complicated and interesting structure .",
    "let @xmath12 denote the parameter space of monic polynomials @xmath2 of degree @xmath1 defined over @xmath11 with @xmath13 .",
    "note that every degree @xmath1 polynomial can be put in this form via conjugation by an affine linear transformation .",
    "we call a map @xmath2 _ post - critically bounded _ ( pcb ) if all of its critical points have bounded orbit under iteration of @xmath2 . let @xmath14 denote the subset of @xmath12 that is pcb .",
    "we define the following quantity , which measures the critical radius of the @xmath4-adic mandelbrot set in @xmath12 : @xmath15    one may wonder why we define @xmath16 using the @xmath4-adic valuations of critical points of polynomials in @xmath12 rather than using the @xmath4-adic valuations of their coefficients .",
    "when @xmath17 , as we will see in theorem  [ pgtd ] , the two notions are equivalent . in other situations , however , parameterizing by the critical points rather than by the coefficients is more natural . for example , when @xmath1 is a power of @xmath4 , it is easier to describe @xmath14 in terms of the critical points rather than the coefficients , as we will see in proposition  [ primepower ] .",
    "this is because there is one uniform bound on the absolute value of critical points for polynomials in @xmath14 , but the bounds for the coefficients @xmath18 vary depending on the @xmath4-adic valuation of @xmath19",
    ".    knowing @xmath16 can be useful in searching for all post - critically finite polynomials over a given number field , as is done for cubic polynomials over @xmath20 in @xcite . for small primes , in particular @xmath7 ,",

    "we prove our main result in section 5 .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in section 6 with a study of a one - parameter family of cubic polynomials over @xmath28 to illustrate the fact that @xmath14 can indeed be quite complicated .",

    "the following example of a one - parameter family of cubic polynomials reveals that the boundary of this mandelbrot set can be complicated and fractal - like .",
    "consider the following one - parameter family of cubic polynomials , where the parameter @xmath278 : @xmath279 of the two critical points , one ( zero ) is a fixed point and the other is @xmath280 .",
    "note that @xmath281 corresponds to a post - critically finite map ( i.e. , all critical points are preperiodic ) , with the free critical point 1 mapping to the fixed point @xmath282 .",
    "[ bdrybehavior ] consider the one - parameter family of cubic polynomials in defined in .",
    "for the sequence of parameters @xmath283 converging to @xmath281 , the corresponding polynomials @xmath284 for @xmath285 are not pcb .",
    "there is another sequence , @xmath286 , also converging to @xmath281 , for which the corresponding polynomials for @xmath287 are all pcb .",
    "proposition  [ bdrybehavior ] shows that @xmath281 is on the boundary of the @xmath4-adic mandelbrot set for this family of polynomials , in that it is arbitrarily close in the parameter space to parameters corresponding to both pcb and non - pcb maps . for @xmath17 ,",
    "such examples do not exist , as @xmath288 is simply the unit polydisk in @xmath289 , which has empty boundary .",
    "first , consider the sequence @xmath291 , where @xmath292 .",
    "as @xmath114 approaches infinity , @xmath293 approaches @xmath53 in @xmath28 .",
    "we will now show that for @xmath285 , the orbit of the critical point @xmath293 under @xmath284 is unbounded .",
    "in fact , we can say something stronger . if @xmath294 for some @xmath295 with @xmath285 , then @xmath296 is not pcb",
    ". let @xmath297 and @xmath285 such that @xmath298 .",
    "we begin by calculating the first few iterates of @xmath280 under @xmath296 : @xmath299 @xmath300 @xmath301 from here , each iterate moves further away from @xmath282 , so that for @xmath156 we have @xmath302 thus , @xmath303 and we can write @xmath304 , where @xmath305 .",
    "a quick calculation then shows that @xmath306 .",
    "note that in this case , @xmath307 .",
    "so , since @xmath308 , the orbit of @xmath280 is unbounded .",
    "now we turn our attention to the other sequence .",
    "let @xmath286 .",
    "we will show that the orbit of @xmath309 under iteration of @xmath310 is bounded .",
    "for ease of notation , let @xmath311 for some @xmath287 . once again , we begin by calculating the first few iterates : @xmath312 @xmath313 @xmath314 in general , for @xmath315 , we have @xmath316 more specifically , @xmath317 .",
    "this shows that we can write @xmath318 for some odd integer @xmath319 .",
    "calculating one more iterate , we see that @xmath320 this puts @xmath280 in the basin of attraction of @xmath321 , because @xmath296 maps @xmath322 onto itself .",
    "this example shows that this @xmath327-adic mandelbrot set , i.e. , the set @xmath328 , has a complicated boundary .",
    "while this set is difficult to visualize over @xmath28 , we can begin to draw this set if we restrict to @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath329 . for @xmath330 , note that @xmath331 .",
    "we now calculate @xmath332 : @xmath333 therefore , the orbit of @xmath280 is unbounded for all @xmath280 outside the unit disk .",
    "next note that @xmath296 maps @xmath87 into itself for @xmath334 .",
    "so @xmath335 for @xmath334 .",
    "if we are interested in the boundary of @xmath336 , we therefore only have to consider @xmath280 for which @xmath290 .",
    "we can represent a neighborhood in @xmath6 as a binary tree , as every disk in @xmath6 is comprised of two disjoint disks .",
    "for example , the disk @xmath337 , which will be the root of our tree , is comprised of @xmath338 and @xmath339 . each disk in turn branches into two smaller disks .",
    "traversing down the tree , one `` zooms in '' on a point in @xmath6 .",
    "see figure [ fig : fig1 ] for a depiction of the first few levels of this tree .",
    "we color a node black if the entire disk is in @xmath336 , we color a node white if the entire disk is outside @xmath336 , and we color a node gray if it contains some points in @xmath336 and some points outside it . the number that labels each node denotes the center of the disk the node represents .",
    "as one moves down the left side of the tree , one zooms in on the post - critically finite boundary point @xmath281 .",
    "this tree is symmetrical , because @xmath340 , and so @xmath296 is pcb if and only if @xmath341 is pcb . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , we depict the disk @xmath342 and the tree that emanates from it to give a sense of the complexity of @xmath336 .    note that as one zooms in on @xmath281 , a self - similar pattern emerges , as illustrated in figure [ fig : fig3 ] and as shown in proposition [ bdrybehavior ] .",
    "this is reminiscent of the classical mandelbrot set over @xmath10 and its fractal - like boundary . beginning at @xmath326 for any @xmath221",
    ", we see in figure [ fig : fig3 ] that the pattern repeats every time we move two levels down the tree toward @xmath53 .",
    "the disk @xmath343 corresponds to non - pcb maps , while the disks @xmath344 and @xmath345 correspond to pcb maps .",
    "the parameter values in the disk @xmath346 , labeled in figure [ fig : fig3 ] with a question mark , exhibit quite complicated behavior .",
    "some data collected with sage shows that for many values of @xmath114 one often has to move twenty or more levels down the tree before one finds a disk that is entirely pcb or entirely non - pcb .",
    "furthermore , the locations of these disks vary with @xmath114 , and there is no apparent pattern .",
    "this is where the boundary of @xmath336 seems to be most intricate .",
