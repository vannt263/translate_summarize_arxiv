    "`` quasar light curves do not show the effects of time dilation''this result of the paper @xcite seems incredible .",
    "the cosmological time dilation is a very basic phenomenon predicted by the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric .",
    "how can quasars ignore this fundamental effect of relativistic cosmology ?",
    "of course , extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence . until the puzzling results of @xcite are firmly confirmed by independent observations",
    ", we can not be certain that what is observed in @xcite is a real observation of time non - dilation in quasar light curves and not a some unaccounted systematic error , for example , in data analysis .",
    "nevertheless , we will assume in this article that the results of @xcite are correct and try to explain why quasars behave like strangers in our frw world .",
    "strangely enough , our main idea came from fyodor tyutchev s poetry ( see the epigraph ) .",
    "the image of capricious hebe tipping a quasar - foaming goblet on our universe was a poetic metaphor guiding this investigation and what follows can be considered as an attempt of more or less scientific incarnation of this irresistible metaphor .    the paper is organized in five parts . in the first section we consider caveats of the standard picture of expanding space as a rather subjective notion . on the other hand , in contrast to expanding space , which can be considered as a kind of coordinate artifact ,",
    "cosmological time dilation is argued to be an unavoidable , coordinate independent prediction for any internal time variability of any object participating in the hubble flow .",
    "therefore , if quasars really manage to escape bonds of time dilation , a natural inference will be that they somehow do not participate in the hubble flow .",
    "this quasar mystery is accompanied with some others that are discussed in the second section .",
    "the following section gives a detailed description of the milne model .",
    "in the ideal case , the milne universe is a part of the minkowski space - time with the future light - cone of the big bang event as its impenetrable boundary .",
    "however , the density of the milne fundamental observers , tending to infinity on this boundary , makes unrealistic the realization of the ideal milne universe .",
    "this conclusion is further strengthened if we consider a quantum scalar field in the milne universe : if the boundary is assumed to be impenetrable , the corresponding choice of the initial vacuum state is not an adiabatic but a conformal vacuum that leads to the pair production phenomenon indicating the presence of physically unrealistic infinite power sources on the milne universe s singular boundary .    in the forth section",
    "it is argued that in any realistic incarnation of the milne universe it is expected that objects from `` outside '' can penetrate inside the milne universe .",
    "then we postulate that the existence of analogous objects in our universe is possible and we comment how these objects which do not participate in the hubble flow due to their `` otherworldly '' origin , can offer an explanation of some quasar mysteries .    in the final section we provide concluding remarks and discuss how the result of this work can be related to other ideas described in the literature .",
    "we have tried to make the paper as self - contained as possible by providing enough details of all calculations , and we hope that `` the reader will not need to have his fingers at eleven places to follow an  argument '' @xcite .",
    "expansion of space is , probably , the most familiar concept in modern cosmology .",
    "however , this beguilingly simple idea harbors many dangers of misunderstanding and misuse even for professional physicists , `` most scientists think they understand it , but few agree on what it really means '' @xcite .",
    "it is not surprising that the subtle notion of expanding space became a subject of continuing debates @xcite , largely triggered by a beautiful _ scientific american _",
    "article by lineweaver and davis @xcite .",
    "we can identify at least two main reasons why it is dangerous and misleading to speak about expanding space without explicitly clarifying what is really meant by this combination of words .",
    "first of all , as special relativity teaches us , space by itself does not constitute an objective space - time does .",
    "as eloquently expressed by minkowski `` henceforth , space by itself and time by itself are doomed to fade away into mere shadows , and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality '' @xcite .",
    "it does not make sense , therefore , to speak about expanding space without clarifying what foliation of space - time we have in mind and why we have chosen this    in general relativity understanding is further complicated by the fact that coordinates loose their usual meaning as temporal and spatial labels of events .",
    "we can use any coordinate system in general relativity to describe a given physical phenomenon and we should be very careful to separate the real physical events from mere coordinate artifacts .",
    "moreover , when we speak about temporal development in space of some physical process , we should specify what coordinate system was chosen and for what reason . without doing so , `` to some degree we mislead both our students and ourselves when we calculate , for instance",
    ", the mercury perihelion motion without explaining how our coordinate system is fixed in space , what defines it in such a way that it can not be rotated , by a few seconds a year , to follow the perihelion s apparent motion  expressing our results in terms of the values of coordinates became a habit to such an extend , that we adhere to this habit also in general relativity , where values of coordinates are not meaningful per se '' @xcite .",
    "it is the symmetry of space - time , namely isotropy and homogeneity of space , which determines its preferred foliation .",
    "more precisely , the cosmological or copernican principle states that we do not occupy a special place in the universe , which , at large , is very much the same everywhere at any given instance .",
    "mathematically this means ( see , for example , @xcite ) that the space - time can be foliated into spacelike slices and has a form @xmath0 , where every spacelike slice @xmath1 is a maximally symmetric space ( homogeneous and isotropic ) and @xmath2 represents the cosmic time ( a succession of instances of `` now '' ) .",
    "geometrically the cosmic time is essentially the parameter that labels spacelike slices and each slice hypersurface is an orbit of the symmetry group of spatial homogeneity and isotropy @xcite .",
    "the metric which corresponds to this preferred foliation is the celebrated friedmann - robertson- walker metric ( in units where @xmath3 ) :    @xmath4 , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] with @xmath5 , @xmath6 or @xmath7 corresponding to the close , flat or open universes respectively .",
    "the expansion of space has a clear meaning in frw coordinates : the scale factor @xmath8 depends on cosmic time .",
    "the particular form of this dependence is determined from einstein equations . however",
    ", this fact does not mean much without connecting it to real physical observables : as was mentioned above , we should distinguish real physical effects from coordinate artifacts .",
    "one coordinate artifact is the singularity ( for positive @xmath9 ) of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) at @xmath10 and it can be removed by introducing a new radial coordinate @xmath11 according to @xcite : @xmath12 where the generalized sine function @xmath13 is defined as follows @xcite : @xmath14 in new coordinates the metric takes the form @xcite @xmath15 . \\label{eq4}\\ ] ]    how can we be sure that the time dependence of the scale factor can not be similarly removed by a suitable change of coordinates ?",
    "for example , let us consider the following cosmological model . the metric eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) has two characteristic length scales both of which in general evolve in time : the spatial curvature radius @xmath16 and the hubble length @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the hubble parameter that sets the time scale of the cosmic expansion .",
    "an attractive possibility is the perfect cosmological principle that the universe at large is not only homogeneous in space but also in time .",
    "bondi s derisive formulation @xcite `` geography does not matter , and history does not matter either '' expresses the perfect cosmological principle more eloquently .",
    "it is immediately obvious that for the non - dependence on time of the curvature radius and of the hubble length , it is necessary to have @xmath6 and @xmath19 with some constant @xmath20 which can be absorbed into the exponential part and then eliminated by a time translation ( by suitable redefinition of the origin of time scale ) .",
    "thus , the metric takes the form : @xmath21 .",
    "\\label{eq5}\\ ] ] this beautiful theory , based on the perfect cosmological principle , used to be a base for the steady state theory ( see , for example , @xcite ) before the latter being killed by some ugly observational facts @xcite .",
    "however , nowadays this de sitter cosmology surprisingly resurrected as a possible description of reality as it may correspond to universe s initial inflationary phase or its terminal state .",
    "let us introduce the new coordinates @xmath22 instead of @xmath23 through relations ( see , for example , @xcite ) : @xmath24    in this so called static coordinates the metric eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) becomes @xmath25    the static coordinates determine another slicing ( foliation ) of the de sitter space , which does nt show any sign of space expansion .",
    "what about other foliations ?",
    "let us introduce the following fancy coordinatization of the de sitter space : @xmath26    this set of five coordinates is obviously not independent as the de sitter space - time is four dimensional . from eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) we easily find that @xmath27    therefore , these coordinates define a four - dimensional hypersurface in the five - dimensional space .",
    "the really remarkable fact about these coordinates is however that the de sitter expanding metric eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) on this hypersurface is induced by the five - dimensional minkowski metric in the ambient  space : @xmath28    this can be easily checked by explicit calculations starting from relations eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) . but",
    "these coordinates are in fact based on the symmetry considerations @xcite .    thus , the de sitter universe can be considered as a highly symmetric four - dimensional hypersurface ( a minkowskian sphere ) in circumambient five - dimensional minkowski space - time .",
    "each foliation , which endows this minkowskian sphere with a sense of time , are on equal footing according to the spirit of relativity .",
    "however , the cosmological circumstances can dictate the preferred foliation .",
    "for example , the exponentially expanding universe eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) corresponds to the sense of time of comoving observers for which the cosmic microwave background is isotropic and the universe itself is spatially flat .",
    "however , other foliations exist and can give closed or open universes @xcite .",
    "namely , if we define comoving frw coordinates as : @xmath29 the ambient minkowski metric induces on the four - dimensional minkowskian sphere the metric : @xmath30 , \\label{eq12}\\ ] ] which corresponds to the close , cosmological constant dominated , frw universe . while using the coordinatization @xmath31 we get an open , cosmological constant dominated , frw universe with the metric @xmath32 .",
    "\\label{eq14}\\ ] ]    as we see , the notion of expanding space is rather subjective . only comoving observers ( galaxies )",
    "would find it natural , and our insistence on using this notion reflects our belief that there is no other natural set of observers which would define a different preferred foliation for cosmology .",
    "nevertheless , it seems that quasars dispute this common wisdom and do not find expanding space natural .",
    "cosmological redshift is usually associated with the expanding space .",
    "however , in contrast to the expanding space , redshift is a directly observable objective property of light signals emitted by    suppose two light signals are emitted at cosmological times @xmath33 and @xmath34 in a distant galaxy at the comoving coordinate @xmath11",
    ". we at @xmath35 will receive signals at cosmological times @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "how are @xmath38 and @xmath39 related to each other ?",
    "we can find this relation as follows @xcite .",
    "light propagates along null - geodesics or with @xmath40 along its world - line . then , for radially propagating light - signals we have from eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) @xmath41 and , therefore , @xmath42    hence , we obtain the cosmological time dilation relation @xmath43    as its derivation indicates , it is an elementary and general consequence of general relativity and space - time geometry .",
    "usually this time dilation relation is applied to redshifts : if @xmath44 represents the period ( inverse frequency ) of light - wave with the wavelength @xmath45 , then the redshift @xmath46    the derivation of the cosmological time dilation relation eq .",
    "( [ eq16 ] ) is the most simple in the comoving coordinates where it can be interpreted as a result of the space expansion .",
    "but we can still use any other coordinates .",
    "let us consider , for example , the de sitter space - time in static coordinates where nothing expands or shrinks and rederive eq .",
    "( [ eq16 ] ) .    for radial light propagation , we have from eq . ( [ eq7 ] ) that @xmath47 ( @xmath48 decreases when the light signal moves towards us from a distant galaxy .",
    "hence the minus sign ) .",
    "we obtain then the following relations : @xmath49    assuming infinitesimal @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we can easily get from eq .",
    "( [ eq19 ] ) @xmath52    the coordinate @xmath53 of a comoving galaxy does not change with time ; taking it into account , the second relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) indicates that @xmath54    using this expression and @xmath55 , we get from eq .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) @xmath56    but the coordinate time @xmath57 is not the time that clocks of the comoving observers actually measure .",
    "the latter according to eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) is just the cosmic time @xmath44 , and the first equation in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) together with eq .",
    "( [ eq21 ] ) indicate the following relation between them @xmath58    therefore , @xmath59    the fact that eq .",
    "( [ eq24 ] ) is the same relation as eq .",
    "( [ eq16 ] ) is not obvious , but can be shown as follows @xcite . along a null radial geodesic from @xmath60 to @xmath61 , we have according to eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) @xmath62 and respectively @xmath63    then , the second equation in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) indicates that @xmath64 and , therefore , @xmath65    which proves that eq.s ( [ eq16 ] ) and ( [ eq24 ] ) relations are equivalent .",
    "however , the physical interpretation of the cosmological time dilation in static coordinates is different . the relation following from eq . ( [ eq7 ] ) : @xmath66 between the cosmic time @xmath67 ( the proper time of comoving observers ) and the coordinate time @xmath68 , where @xmath69 can be interpreted @xcite as resulting from both the gravitational redshift due to `` potential '' @xmath70 , and the kinematical effect ( the doppler shift ) due to the hubble recession velocity @xmath71 of the light - source .    as the discussion above shows , in contrast to the expanding space , which is a subjective notion depending upon the coordinate choice",
    ", the cosmological time dilation is an objective and very basic phenomenon with the important observable consequence that the rate of any time variation of the radiation emitted by a distant source with the cosmological redshift @xmath72 should be proportional to @xmath73 ( see eq.s ( [ eq16 ] ) and ( [ eq17 ] ) ) .",
    "there is no way to escape this conclusion under the standard belief that all distant astrophysical objects participate in the hubble flow .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that observations of distant type ia supernova confirms this time dilation prediction @xcite ( it was suggested long ago to use supernova to detect the time dilation @xcite ) .    however , a recent study of over 800 quasar light curves found no evidence of the expected effects of time dilation @xcite . this is a very surprising result with no explanation within the conventional cosmological framework (",
    "note that some studies report the lack of time dilation signatures also in gamma - ray burst light curves @xcite .",
    "see however @xcite ) .",
    "some non - conventional explanations were proposed in @xcite , for example , the idea that the expected effects of the quasar time dilation are exactly compensated by an increase in the intrinsic timescale of quasar variability due to the growth of the quasar black holes , or that the observed variations are not intrinsic for quasars but are caused by microlensing events at much lower redshifts .",
    "nonetheless , these explanations do not seem plausible .",
    "we will try to argue in this note that this surprising result , if confirmed without any doubt , will imply a radical change of our cosmological perspective , namely that ( at least some ) quasars are related to the pre - big - bang objects , which we call st .",
    "augustine s objects for reasons explained later .",
    "these objects would define a preferred foliation different from the preferred foliation of the hubble flow comoving observables and this new preferred foliation implies a pre - existing space - time predating the big bang .",
    "perhaps some comments are appropriate here .",
    "application of the cosmological principle assumes that the cosmic time and the corresponding three dimensional space , defined as a set of simultaneous events according to this cosmic time , are well defined concepts in cosmology .",
    "it may seem that this is obvious and should be taken for granted . however , gdel s discovery @xcite of cosmological space - time with closed timelike curves passing through every event made it clear that in general , the existence of global cosmic time is not at all guaranteed ( the first example of space - time with closed timelike curves was in fact given by lanczos @xcite in 1923 and then rediscovered by van stockum @xcite in 1937 ) .",
    "the existence of cosmic time requires a condition which is stronger than causality .",
    "namely , a space - time admits a cosmic time if and only if it is stably causal @xcite .",
    "space - time is stably causal if closed timelike curves are not only absent but they do not appear even after a deformation of the space - time metric which slightly opens up the light cones all over the space - time @xcite .",
    "friedmann - robertson - walker metric is stably causal and therefore admits the cosmic time .",
    "however , it is the matter content of the universe ( cosmic substratum ) and motion pattern of this substratum which actually endow the cosmic time and friedmann - robertson - walker metric with the real physical meaning via celebrated weyl s",
    "principle @xcite .",
    "weyl s principle is an assumption about the nature of the hubble flow and it states that world lines of the `` fundamental particles '' of the cosmic substratum ( usually assumed to be galaxies or clusters of galaxies ) form , after averaging over the peculiar motion , a space - time - filling family ( congruence ) of non - crossing geodesics converging towards the common past @xcite .",
    "friedmann - robertson - walker metric holds a privileged position as it is co - moving with the fundamental observers .",
    "the above mentioned congruence of world lines is unique in the frw space - time and thus defines its preferred foliation into spatial hypersurfaces that are ordered in cosmic time .    unlike the frw space - time",
    ", in the de sitter space - time there is no unique choice of congruence and that s why the de sitter space - time can be considered either as a static or as an expanding universe @xcite .",
    "when we speak about st .",
    "augustine s objects it is in fact assumed that the frw space - time is only a part of a bigger entity ( imagine , for example , an embedding of a spatially flat frw space - time into the five - dimensional minkowski space considered at the end of the paper ) and that motion pattern of the cosmic substratum in other parts of this encompassing space are quite different from the weyl congruence defining the hubble flow .",
    "quasars ( quasi - stellar objects ) are fascinating objects discovered half a century ago @xcite . shortly after their discovery , zeldovich @xcite and salpeter @xcite independently suggested accretion on a black hole as an energy source of quasars .",
    "this hypothesis became universally accepted after the publication of lynden - bell @xcite showing that the main properties of quasars could indeed be understood in terms of release of gravitational binding energy of matter accreting onto a supermassive black hole .",
    "nevertheless , quasars largely remain the most mysterious and enigmatic objects in the universe and even the most basic and major questions about them are far from being settled @xcite .",
    "let us briefly outline some problems in quasar research with no definite answers @xcite .      if we adopt the standard view that the observed quasar redshifts are of cosmological origin , when the unavoidable consequence is that the quasars are immensely bright : brighter than thousands of the brightest galaxies at low redshifts .",
    "at that strong variability of quasars in short time scales indicates that the majority of this immense energy is emitted from a tiny region not exceeding the solar system in size .",
    "supermassive black holes are indeed the only powerhouses that can be imagined to meet such extreme energy and size requirements .    a simple argument why the central black hole in quasars should be supermassive goes as let us assume a steady accretion so that the inward gravitational force @xmath74 acting on a small element @xmath75 of accreting gas of density @xmath76 in the gravitational potential @xmath77 of the black hole is balanced everywhere by the radiation pressure force @xmath78 on this gas element .",
    "if the gas is fully ionized hydrogen then radiation pressure force acts mainly on free electrons through thomson scattering ( for protons the scattering cross section is smaller by the factor @xmath79 ) .",
    "however , due to coulomb attraction , the electrons drag the protons with them so that the charge separation does not occur ) . the thomson cross section @xmath80 gives the effective area for an electron to absorb radiation when it is illuminated . therefore ,",
    "if the radiation energy flux is @xmath81 , each electron absorbs momentum at a rate @xmath82 . the radiation pressure force @xmath78 equals the rate at which the volume element @xmath75 absorbs momentum . in this volume element",
    "we have @xmath83 protons and hence , the same amount of electrons , as the gas is assumed to be fully ionized .",
    "therefore , @xmath84    then the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath85 , gives the equation @xmath86    using this relation , the gauss s theorem and the poisson equation @xmath87 , @xmath88 being the newton constant , we can calculate the total luminosity as a surface integral over some closed surface @xmath89 around the quasar : @xmath90    therefore , finally , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the quasar mass .",
    "this so called eddington luminosity is an estimate of the maximal luminosity a quasar of mass @xmath92 can have if it is powered by a steady accretion .",
    "substituting and other physical constants , eq .",
    "( [ eq30 ] ) can be rewritten as follows @xcite @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the solar mass .",
    "typical quasar luminosity is @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "( [ eq31])indicates that a central mass of the order of @xmath96 is required .",
    "various methods were developed in past decades to estimate quasar masses from observations @xcite and the results confirm the above conclusion that quasars are supermassive .",
    "moreover , the results indicate @xcite that quasars with masses @xmath97 were probably already present at @xmath98 when the universe was less than 1 gyr old .",
    "this raises a potential problem : how these supermassive black holes have had grown up given the limited time they had ?",
    "if the accretion rate is @xmath99 , then the associated luminosity can be written as @xmath100 , with @xmath101 representing the radiative efficiency that equals the fraction of the accreted rest energy converted into radiation .",
    "the growth rate of the black hole under such accretion is @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , from these two relations , using the eddington luminosity eq .",
    "( [ eq30 ] ) , we get @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the so called salpeter time . equation ( [ eq32 ] ) indicates that under the steady eddington accretion the black hole mass grows exponentially with time : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the mass of the black hole seed .",
    "what can we say about the radiative efficiency @xmath101 ? to estimate @xmath101 , we can use a newtonian argument .",
    "in fact not quite newtonian , because the pure newtonian estimate , assuming that the accretion disk extends up to the schwarzschild radius , is a factor of two higher than the more appropriate general relativistic result .",
    "however , it was shown be paczysky and wiita that the following simple pseudo - newtonian potential @xmath107 reproduces the correct general relativistic results surprisingly accurately as far as the black hole accretion flaw is concerned @xcite . here , @xmath108 is the schwarzschild radius of the black hole .    for a test body of mass @xmath109 moving on a circular orbit of radius @xmath53 in the potential eq .",
    "( [ eq35 ] ) , we find for its velocity @xmath110 and for its total energy @xmath111    as we see , only for @xmath112 the bound circular orbits are possible .",
    "but not all of them are stable .",
    "the stability condition is the following :    @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the effective potential corresponding to the orbital momentum @xmath115 .",
    "the orbital radius @xmath53 is determined from the condition @xmath116    this enables us to exclude @xmath115 and rewrite the stability condition in the form @xmath117    therefore , only circular orbits with @xmath118 are stable and hence , the steady accretion disk ends at @xmath119 .",
    "the binding energy at this innermost stable orbit is , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq36 ] ) , @xmath120    when the particle of mass @xmath109 migrates from the outskirts of the accretion disk at @xmath121 , where its binding energy @xmath122 , to the inner edge of the accretion disk , this @xmath123 energy is released as heat and eventually radiation . therefore",
    ", the radiative efficiency of such a schwarzschild black hole engine is @xmath124 .",
    "more correct treatment of general relativistic effects gives @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "rotating black holes can lead to even higher radiative efficiencies : up to about @xmath126 in realistic case @xcite . for comparison , nuclear burning of hydrogen to helium in stars has the efficiency of only @xmath127 .",
    "usually , in quasar research one assumes a canonical radiative efficiency of @xmath128 @xcite . for at @xmath98 and @xmath129  gyr that corresponds to @xmath130 when the first stars were formed , we get from eq .",
    "( [ eq34 ] ) that the black hole seeds of mass @xmath131 is needed .",
    "this seems somewhat high as it is expected that the black hole remnants from the first generation stars had typical values less than tens of solar masses @xcite .",
    "although this is not considered as an immediate problem , because we could imagine ways how to produce such massive black hole seeds ( for example , direct collapse of primordial gas clouds @xcite ) , but it will be fair to say that we do not completely understand the origin of supermassive black holes at present . even if we would have a sufficiently massive black hole seed , it is not clear how a steady accretion at eddington rates can be maintained for such a long period of time .",
    "the accreting gas has to lose about @xmath132 of its angular momentum to migrate from the host galaxy to the vicinity of the black hole @xcite . during this time",
    ", various processes can intervene to make the accretion not continuous .",
    "for example , star formation which inevitably occur in the accretion disks on large scales , can reduce the amount of gas which can be directly accreted onto the black hole @xcite .",
    "in fact , our present day arguments about how quasars ignite and produce their stupendous energies are of the kind of hand - waving lacking necessary details @xcite and so we still do not have good predictive physical models @xcite .",
    "another mysterious thing about quasars which is poorly understood is the evolution of quasar luminosity over redshifts : quasars at high redshifts are far more luminous than quasars at low but , strangely , quasar spectra show little evidence , if any , of this evolution : quasar spectral features at low and high redshifts are very similar @xcite .",
    "it seems that quasars were already mature at @xmath133 and the physical properties of their accretion disks have not changed since then despite strong evolution of their luminosities .",
    "not only quasars at high redshifts seem to be mature but their surroundings too .",
    "it is assumed that it requires many generations of supernovae to produce sizable amount of metals .",
    "so , the natural expectation is that the accreting material for high redshift quasars should be metal - free .",
    "observations , on the contrary , indicate that metallicities are even higher than the solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "recent discovery of @xmath134 galaxy with significant metallicity and very high star formation rate @xcite also indicates more rapid chemical evolution in the early universe than it is usually assumed .",
    "some quasars were found @xcite at @xmath135 without any detectable infrared emission from the hot dust which is expected in the standard accretion disk model and is indeed universally present at low redshifts .",
    "this may be a sign of the long evolution of quasars absent in the ultraviolet , optical and x - ray bands of their spectra .",
    "however , the rarity of such dust - free quasars indicate a very rapid mass accretion and dust formation at their alleged early evolutionary stages @xcite .",
    "another question is what ignites a quasar .",
    "it is usually assumed that the major merger events of gas - rich galaxies trigger the accretion on the central black hole and ignite a quasar .",
    "however about half of host galaxies have undistorted disks and show no signs of distortions induced by merger @xcite .",
    "besides the problem of explaining the appearance at a surprisingly early times after the big bang of chemically mature galaxies hosting a supermassive black holes , there is still another age problem related to quasars .",
    "namely , a quasar was discovered at @xmath136 whose age is 23  gyr , while according to the standard cosmological model the universe was only 1.63  gyr old at this redshift @xcite .",
    "therefore , this quasar appears to be older than the universe  an obvious paradox requiring explanation .",
    "while the so called @xmath137-process elements ( @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath89 ) are mainly produced in type ii supernovae , the so called iron - peak elements ( @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 ) are produced in type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "the corresponding characteristic time scales are vastly different which enables to estimate the age of astrophysical objects by measuring their @xmath148 abundance ratios .",

    "we have heavily used the milne model in this article to justify our suppositions .",
    "it is time to ask what are the relations of this model with reality .",
    "we introduced the milne metric as a metric of an empty frw universe .",
    "the present density of matter is rather low in terms of the critical density .",
    "therefore , probably , it is not surprising that the milne metric describes some aspects of the present day universe quite satisfactorily .",
    "namely , curiously the milne model explains supernovae observations rather well without requiring any dark energy @xcite .",
    "the standard concordance @xmath275cdm model with positive cosmological constant , of course , provides a better fit and , as expected , an empty universe is not its viable alternative .",
    "nevertheless , `` the milne model has great pedagogical value , elucidating the kinematic aspect of the universe s expansion '' @xcite .",
    "however , in fact , milne s aspiration was significantly more ambitious than just providing late time approximate description of frw cosmology in terms of special relativity .",
    "milne believed that some very general rational and at the same time aesthetic principles were at the foundations of the observed order and regularities in the universe .",
    "his approach , named kinematic relativity @xcite , was conceived as a rival theory to the standard relativistic cosmology .",
    "milne s aim was  to deduce as much as possible merely from the cosmological principle and the basic properties of space , time and the propagation of revealed by special relativity .",
    "milne s unorthodox methodology triggered a heated debate involving the most eminent cosmologists of the time @xcite .",
    "when the kinematic relativity was first developed `` it met great hostility and was criticized very severely , often unjustly , and sometimes frivolously '' @xcite .",
    "in retrospect , the influence of milne on the development of modern cosmology was very substantial and he inspired others , in particular robertson and walker , in shaping fundamental concepts of modern cosmology @xcite .",
    "however , as for the kinematic relativity , very little work has been done on it since the death of milne and the theory has been left `` in a curiously unfinished state '' @xcite .",
    "walker showed @xcite that milne s cosmological construction , if described in terms of geometry , was fundamentally different from that of general relativity and , in general , such a description requires finsler geometry , a generalization of riemannian geometry ( for applications of finsler geometry see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "although we feel that the finslerian perspective of the milne model was not sufficiently explored , at present the milne model can not be considered as a viable alternative to the standard relativistic cosmology , of course . therefore , in the spirit of this paper we can use it as only a source of inspiration and not a solid ground to justify the introduction of the st .",
    "augustine s objects .",
    "can we find a support for them in more mainstream theories ?    in non - empty frw cosmological models",
    "we can not define global inertial frames and thus , we can not introduce private time like milne did . however , a plausible generalization of the concept of private time can be envisaged in the general case as well thanks to the fact that weyl tensor for all frw cosmological metrics vanishes and thus all frw space - times are conformally flat @xcite .",
    "suitably defined conformal time can serve as a substitute of private time .",
    "for example , in the case of the flat frw metric we can introduce conformal time - coordinate @xmath68 and conformal radial coordinate @xmath48 in the following way @xcite @xmath509 where @xmath510 with arbitrary @xmath155 . substituting the inverse transformations @xmath511 into eq .",

    "( [ eq111 ] ) , @xmath514 region is mapped onto the region @xmath515 , while the region @xmath516onto the region @xmath517 . as in the case of private space and time in the milne model , the frw universe coordinates occupy only a quarter of the @xmath518 plane and this circumstance hints at a possibility that the frw universe might be just a part of some bigger entity . let us note , however , that the conformal coordinates considered are not exact analogues of the milne s private time and private space .",
    "in particular , transformations eq .",
    "( [ eq111 ] ) are singular at the light - cone @xmath519 .",
    "another analogue of the milne foliation is the rindler s foliation of a non - empty frw by spacelike slices of finite volume .",
    "rindler showed that , just like the milne universe , `` every open big - bang frw universe can be regarded as an expanding finite - volume ball of matter , springing from zero volume '' @xcite .",
    "this feature of frw space - time becomes particularly clear from the multi - dimensional perspective @xcite .",
    "it is well known that any four - dimensional space - time can be locally embedded ( immersed ) in a ten - dimensional flat pseudo - euclidean space @xcite . because of the high degree of symmetry of the frw space - time , its embedding is possible even in a five - dimensional pseudo - euclidean space @xcite .",
    "namely , the embedding of a spatially flat frw spacetime @xmath520 into the five - dimensional minkowski space is defined by relations @xcite : @xmath521 where @xmath522 and @xmath137 is a constant with the dimension of length .",
    "therefore , eq.s ( [ eq117 ] ) and ( [ eq118 ] ) define a hyper - surface in the five - dimensional minkowski space . for example , in the radiation dominated universe @xmath526 with some @xmath527 , and the eq .",
    "( [ eq117 ] ) , defining the hyper - surface , takes the form ( in the case @xmath528 ) @xmath529      as we see , a multi - dimensional perspective allows to consider a non - empty frw universe as a part of a bigger entity and the overall picture is similar to the one in the milne model that led us to the st .",

    "it is worth mentioning that extra - dimensional models were very popular in the last decade . in such models ,",
    "an ambient space is not the minkowski space but has more complex geometry .",
    "the universe as a thin shell expanding in a five - dimensional space with so called non - factorizable warped geometry was first considered by gogberashvili in @xcite , and such models with warped extra dimensions became very popular after the randall and sundrum paper @xcite .",
    "other popular extra - dimensional models are kaluza - klein type models with compactified extra - dimensions @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that all standard model particles are confined to the four - dimensional hyper - surface , a brane , in a higher dimensional space .",

    "finally , let us mention the so called ekpyrotic cosmology in which the big bang is associated not with a singularity but with a collision of two branes in the extra - dimensional bulk @xcite . as a result , cyclic model of the universe can be constructed in which there is an endless sequence of cosmic epochs of expansion and contraction @xcite .",
