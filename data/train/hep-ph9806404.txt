    "the guiding physical idea underlying the dynamical ( radiative ) parton model is that the steep behavior of the momentum distributions @xmath5 at @xmath0 @xmath6 is a purely perturbative phenomenon .",
    "in fact , in @xcite _ non_steep ( valence  like ) initial distributions @xmath7 at some low scale @xmath8 gev were suggested in order to predict , purely dynamically , the rise of @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the above range of @xmath0 and @xmath11 .",
    "this prediction was subsequently confirmed by the measurements of @xmath12 and @xmath13 at hera @xcite . as was stated in @xcite ,",
    "the available _ pre_hera data at @xmath14 the valence  like input distributions still allowed for a slight , typically o(10% ) , variation ( increase ) of @xmath15 which did not affect @xmath16 but resulted in an about 10% ( 20% ) uncertainty of the radiative predictions at @xmath17 .",
    "hence the o(10% ) discrepancies between the distributions of @xcite and recent precision measurements at hera @xcite are obviously neither unexpected , nor do they invalidate the notion of a radiative , i.e.  dynamical , origin for the steep rise at @xmath0 @xmath18 and @xmath11 @xmath19 gev@xmath4 . indeed , a fine  tuning of @xmath15 and/or @xmath20 was always understood @xcite to be necessary in due course .    given the accuracy of recent hera small@xmath0 data , as well as new large@xmath0 constraints , mainly on the flavor decomposition of the quark sea , it is now appropriate to perform an update of our previous dynamical parton distributions and to follow the effects of these fine  tunings on the predictions for @xmath21 , @xmath22 and other relevant deep inelastic observables .",
    "section 2 will be devoted mainly to a discussion concerning the small@xmath0 implications of the recent h1 and zeus high precision data @xcite on @xmath12 and @xmath22 and how they ( slightly ) modify our previous @xcite valence  like lo / nlo input gluon and sea distributions . further data on @xmath23 and fixed  target results on @xmath24 and @xmath25 , as well as data on @xmath26 and @xmath27 asymmetries relevant for fixing and testing our @xmath28 and @xmath29 densities are presented and compared with the present update and with our previous grv(94 ) results in section 3 .",
    "furthermore , we also extend here our perturbatively stable and parameter  free dynamical small@xmath0 predictions to the ultra small@xmath0 region ( @xmath1 @xmath0 @xmath2 ) , relevant to questions concerning ultra ",
    "high  energy cosmic ray and neutrino astronomy .",
    "finally , in section 4 we present a brief summary and a general discussion concerning the status of the dynamical ( radiative ) parton model in the light of present and future data and its application in theoretical nlo analyses .",
    "as stated in the introduction we intend to study the implications of modifications of our original grv(94 ) input @xcite",
    ". we shall proceed in a stepwise manner and begin with a mere modification of the input scale @xmath30 keeping everything else unchanged .",
    "the results shown in figs .  1 and 2",
    "illustrate the point that the previously noted @xcite uncertainty in @xmath30 can accommodate the main discrepancies between @xcite and the recent data @xcite on @xmath21 _ and _ the experimentally extracted @xmath13 .",
    "it should be noted that our present new ( modified ) analysis yields results which lie in between the two curves shown in fig .  1 as will be discussed and illustrated in fig .  3 . our new results ( solid curve ) for @xmath13 at @xmath31 gev@xmath4",
    "are shown as well in fig .",
    "2 where they practically coincide with the one of grv(94 ) with @xmath32 increased by 10% ( dotted curve ) .",
    "the fact that the somewhat too steep grv(94 ) predictions for @xmath21 and @xmath13 at , say , @xmath33 can _ both _ be corrected with the new slightly modified valence  like input constitutes a nontrivial confirmation of the radiative model .",
    "let us now turn to the update of our lo / nlo grv(94 ) densities which consists of a fine  tuning of the valence  like input densities for @xmath20 _ as well as _ of the input scale @xmath15 .",
    "this fine  tuning of the input results mainly from new hera data @xcite on @xmath21 and to a certain extent also from new large@xmath0 results ( such as asymmetry measurements of drell  yan dilepton production in @xmath34 and @xmath35 collisions @xcite ) discussed in more detail in section 3 . for the running coupling @xmath36 at the next  to  leading order ( nlo ) we have utilized the _ exact _ numerical solution , \\ ] ] and our new nlo results correspond , for @xmath37 , to the following values of @xmath38 mev .",

    ", @xmath44 refers in nlo to @xmath45 and in lo ( @xmath46 ) to @xmath47 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath37 for obtaining our exact numerical nlo solutions from ( 1 ) for @xmath48 .",
    "this choice , which is slightly preferred in our present analysis , agrees with the average value of the space  like momentum  transfer measurements @xcite , @xmath49 .",
    "the statistically dominating time ",
    "like @xmath50 lep @xmath51data imply a somewhat larger ` world average ' @xcite of @xmath52 with an error which is to some extent uncertain and debatable .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that lep data ( @xmath51 hadronic decays ) allow @xcite also for a much smaller strong coupling , @xmath53 .",
    "should significantly higher values of @xmath54 , e.g.  @xmath55 , turn out to be undebated and everywhere unique , then our input scale @xmath15 will obviously increase closer to 1 gev which compels one to give up the strict valence  like sea input @xmath56 , but _ not _ the valence  like gluon input @xmath57 , in order to reproduce all @xmath12 data at @xmath11 @xcite . alternatively one may keep the valence  like sea input @xmath56 , also for @xmath58 , as a parameter  free seed for the small@xmath0 structure of @xmath59 , in case one intends to predict and explain the hera  data merely above @xmath60 gev@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "furthermore the conventional approximate formula  ( 2 ) , being sufficiently reliable for @xmath11 @xmath43 , corresponds in our case to @xmath61 mev which reproduces the exact solutions to even better than 0.5% for @xmath62 gev@xmath4 .",
    "our lo results correspond to @xmath63 mev which leads to the ( theoretically less relevant ) value of @xmath64 .",
    "in both cases we have used for the @xmath54 matchings @xmath65 these masses are used in all our subsequent lo and nlo analyses for heavy quark production . in particular the value of @xmath66 , which is slightly lower than the one previously employed in @xcite , is favored .",
    "the free parameters of the non  singlet input densities @xmath67 and of the valence  like singlet input distributions @xmath68 and @xmath69 at @xmath70 have been fixed using the following data sets : the published 1994 and 1995 hera @xmath71 results @xcite for ; the fixed target @xmath71 data of slac @xcite , bcdms @xcite , nmc @xcite and e665 @xcite subject to the standard cuts @xmath72 gev@xmath4 and @xmath73 gev@xmath4 ; the structure function ratios @xmath74 @xcite , together with the @xmath75 results from @xmath76 dis @xcite ; the drell - yan muon  pair production data of e605 @xcite for @xmath77 and of na51 @xcite and e866 @xcite for the cross section ration @xmath78 . the input fit parameters / normalizations of @xmath79 and @xmath80 are further constrained by @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and the ones of the gluon density by the energy  momentum conservation relation @xmath83 \\ , dx = 1.\\ ] ] the resulting lo input distributions at @xmath84 gev@xmath4 are then given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",

    "the corresponding nlo(@xmath89 ) input at @xmath90 gev@xmath4 is   of the valence  like lo / nlo sea input densities @xmath91 , as @xmath92 , depends strongly on the choice of @xmath15 , i.e.  on the chosen value for @xmath93 or , equivalently , on @xmath94 .",
    "we would obtain almost equally agreeable results if we continue to use the _ same _ @xmath36 as in our previous analyses @xcite which was based on the approximate evolution formula ( 2 ) . matching the approximate nlo(@xmath95 to the exact numerical solution of eq .",
    "( 1 ) at , say , @xmath96 gev@xmath4 results in @xmath97 .",
    "as discussed above , this @xmath54 value lies at the lower end of the presently allowed experimental bounds . in this case one obtains @xmath98 gev@xmath4 and @xmath99 , instead of 0.20 in eq .",
    "@xmath100 note again that @xmath101 and @xmath102 , and that there is a correlation between the chosen value of @xmath93 and the resulting value for @xmath103 , which increases with @xmath93 as already discussed above .",
    "note that our obtained value for @xmath103 would have been larger if we had used the ( inappropriate ) approximate formula ( 2 ) instead of the exact solution of ( 1 ) .",
    "it should be furthermore noted that we have chosen , as previously @xcite , a vanishing strange sea at the input scale @xmath15 in order to comply with experimental indications @xcite of an su(3)broken sea . this choice is also supported and slightly favored by our input fits and",
    "compares well @xcite with recent measurements @xcite of @xmath104 .",
    "our @xmath105 is thus generated purely dynamically ( radiatively ) and therefore constitutes , for the time being , an absolute , i.e.   parameter  free prediction .",
    "if future experiments may require a finite strange sea input , then our present results for @xmath105 have to be interpreted as an absolute lower bound for the strange sea .",

    "order perturbation theory . in lo",
    "it derives from the well known photon ",
    "gluon fusion process @xcite @xmath107 .",
    "for the nlo calculations we employ the @xmath108 coefficient functions of @xcite as conveniently parametrized in @xcite . in both cases",
    "we use @xmath109 gev as given in ( 3 ) and choose the factorization and renormalization scales to equal @xmath110 . the bottom contribution",
    "@xmath111 is marginal , reaching at most 1 to 2% .    our resulting small@xmath0 predictions for @xmath71",
    "are shown in fig .  3 and for @xmath112 gev@xmath4 ) by the solid curve in fig .  2 .",
    "these results are not too different from our nlo grv(94 ) expectations @xcite when comparing them with the nlo(94 ) results in figs .  1",
    ". moreover , the nlo results in fig .  3 are favored over the lo ones in the small @xmath11 region , @xmath11 3 gev@xmath4 ( which might indicate that future nnlo contributions could even improve our nlo results in the small @xmath11 region around 1 gev@xmath4 ) .",
    "furthermore , their dependence on choosing different factorization scales @xcite , instead of @xmath113 , is obviously weaker than in lo .",
    "nevertheless , the present lo / nlo stability is even better than for the grv(94 ) @xmath106predictions .",
    "the lo and nlo input densities in eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) are shown in fig .  4 and compared with the nlo ones of grv(94 )",
    "@xcite as well as with their evolutions to @xmath114 gev@xmath4 .",
    "the appropriate valence  like nlo input @xmath115 , which eventually vanishes as @xmath92 , is also shown in the lower right corner of fig .",
    "3 . this illustrates very clearly that the predictions at @xmath116 and @xmath117 are of a purely dynamical origin , in particular the increase of @xmath106 with @xmath0 as @xmath92 is due to the non  vanishing input at . nevertheless , as evident from fig .  3 , our predictions for @xmath11 1 gev@xmath4 fall below the data in the ( very ) small@xmath0 region",
    "this is not unexpected for leading twist2 results , since nonperturbative ( higher twist ) contributions to @xmath21 have eventually to become dominant for decreasing values of @xmath11 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the total momentum fractions carried by the nlo input distributions at @xmath70 in fig",
    ".  4 amount to 56 , 30 and 14% for valence , gluon and sea densities , respectively , which are very similar in lo and similar to our grv(94 ) results @xcite .",
    "further typical small@xmath0 predictions for @xmath13 and @xmath118 are shown in fig .",
    "5 together with their respective inputs at @xmath70 which become , particularly for the gluon input , vanishingly small at @xmath119 .",
    "this illustrates again the purely dynamical origin of the small@xmath0 structure of gluon and sea quark densities at @xmath120 .",
    "also noteworthy is the stability of @xmath121 at @xmath122 , i.e.  not only the perturbative lo / nlo one but also that with respect to our grv(94 ) results .",
    "this stability is almost as good as the one required for a physical quantity like @xmath21 .",
    "the situation is , as usual @xcite , different for @xmath22 which is , however , not as relevant since the gluon density is not directly measurable .",
    "in fact , despite the sizeable difference of the lo and nlo gluon distributions in fig .  5 in the small@xmath0 region , the directly measurable gluon  dominated heavy quark contribution @xmath23 shows a remarkable perturbative stability even for very large values of the ( factorization ) scale , such as @xmath123 , as will be shown in the next section .",
    "furthermore , @xmath10 and @xmath124 at @xmath122 increase almost linearly for @xmath2 @xmath0 @xmath125 and @xmath2 @xmath0 @xmath18 , respectively , on the double  logarithmic plots in fig .",
    "they can thus effectively be represented by @xmath126 with effective slopes @xmath127 in nlo(lo ) , valid in the above mentioned @xmath0intervals .",
    "these steep @xmath128 dynamical small@xmath0 predictions are somewhat smaller than the ones of grv(94 ) @xcite .",
    "6 is an alternative way to present our dynamical ( steep ) small@xmath0 predictions using the slope of @xmath12 .",
    "this directly measurable gluon dominated quantity , @xmath129 , exhibits again a good perturbative stability for @xmath11 1 gev@xmath4 .",
    "the similarity of our new ( modified ) results with our previous nlo grv(94 ) ones @xcite is interesting as well .",
    "we refrain here from plotting any experimental results which are usually @xmath11averaged @xcite and thus may easily give rise to erroneous and misleading interpretations and conclusions when compared with theoretical results for @xmath130 which depend strongly on the specific choices of @xmath0 and @xmath11 . nevertheless , our slopes in fig .",

    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) .",
    "the quality of our nlo fits ( which are slightly favored over their lo counterparts ) in fig .",
    "7 clearly demonstrates that our chosen value of @xmath37 in section  2 is fully consistent with all present fixed ",
    "target high precision dis ( non  singlet ) data in the large@xmath0 region . in our present analysis",
    "we employ the @xmath74 data @xcite as extracted without any ( still uncertain ) corrections for a possible emc effect and nuclear shadowing in deuterium .",
    "together with the @xmath25 constraints from @xmath136 and @xmath137 data @xcite , this procedure leads to a ` traditional ' large@xmath0 behavior , @xmath138 as @xmath139 .",
    "note that we investigated more complicated parametrizations for @xmath140 than used in ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , but found them unnecessary even at the present level of accuracy .    in fig .",
    "9 we compare our new ( modified ) lo and nlo parton distributions with the relevant data on dis charm production @xcite . from hera only the most recent ( preliminary ) 1997 zeus results @xcite are displayed , since they supersede the previous ( published ) measurements @xcite by their greatly improved accuracy . as discussed in the previous section , the gluon @xmath141 dominated @xmath23",

    "9 are in perfect agreement with all available data ( including the original fixed ",
    "target emc data @xcite ) and are furthermore perturbatively stable . even choosing a very large scale like @xmath144 , the nlo results remain essentially unchanged at small@xmath0 @xcite as shown by the ` high scale ' dotted curves in fig .  9 .",
    "this latter stability renders attempts to resum supposedly large logarithms ( @xmath145 ) in heavy quark production cross sections superfluous @xcite .",

    "are now confronted in fig .  11 with the @xmath159 charge asymmetry measurements at the fermilab @xmath160 collider @xcite .",
    "the @xmath161  rapidity asymmetry @xmath162 + of the charged leptons from the @xmath159 decays with the lepton rapidity @xmath163 is a sensitive probe of the difference between @xmath157 and @xmath158 quark distributions at @xmath164 .",

    "this holds true in particular for the prompt photon data where , despite the large scale ( @xmath168 ) uncertainty @xcite , an additional sizeable @xmath167smearing seems to be required @xcite in particular in view of the recent fermilab ( e706 ) @xmath169 measurements @xcite . a further interesting source of information , sensitive to @xmath22 , will be provided by the longitudinal structure function @xmath170 as illustrated for example in @xcite .",
    "the available data on @xmath171 are unfortunately still of rather limited accuracy @xcite .",
    "finally it should be mentioned that the gluon density is also tested in a nlo determination of the strange sea quark density @xmath105 from neutrino induced charm production data , i.e.   opposite  sign dimuon events originating from @xmath172 with @xmath173 . since events give , among other things , direct access to @xmath105 via @xmath174 , and @xmath175 , etc .",

    "high  energy neutrino nucleon cross sections , which are sensitive to parton densities at @xmath0 values as small as @xmath1 , can be rather reliably calculated to about 20% .",
    "this follows not only from the perturbative stability at extremely small values of @xmath0 , where moreover our improved predictions are comparable to the ones based on the nlo grv(94 ) densities , but also from the fact that the predictions at @xmath178 are rather independent of the specific choice for the renormalization scale @xmath179 appearing in @xmath180 and for the factorization scale @xmath142 appearing in the parton densities @xmath181 .",

    "nevertheless one can in practice still utilize the former grv(94 ) distributions @xcite , in particular in view of the fact that in most applications of these parton densities to , say , high@xmath189 jet , photon or heavy quark production , the usually considered ( see , for example , @xcite for a recent review and comparative discussion ) freedom in the choice of the factorization and/or renormalization scale , e.g.  @xmath190 @xmath191 @xmath192 , overshadows the present modifications of our previous distributions @xcite .",
    "it is also necessary to mention that the task of searching the ultimately correct parton distributions is not only affected by the above mentioned higher order uncertainties , but also by the discrepancies between the data sets used , e.g.  between the nmc data @xcite on the one hand and the ccfr @xcite and hera @xcite data on the other , which are not well understood at present @xcite .",

    "it remains to be seen , however , whether a sizeable valence  like gluon density at the same ` dynamical ' input scale is also within the realm of this approach .",
