    "one of the focal points of current astronomical research is the search for circumstellar disks and a study of their transformation into planetary systems .",
    "the aim is to understand how the solar system evolved , and to determine how many other planetary systems might exist in the galaxy .",
    "the huge brightness difference of typically 10@xmath4 to 1 between the central star and light scattered from the disk surface ( sonnhalter et al .  1995",
    "; boss & yorke 1996 ) makes it challenging to detect and resolve circumstellar disks in the optical and near - infrared .",
    "if the disk , however , is seen close to edge - on , it acts as a natural coronagraph and blocks out the light from the central star .",
    "the typical signature for such an alignment is a bipolar reflection nebula intersected by a central dust lane ( whitney & hartmann 1992 ; sonnhalter et al .",
    "1995 ; burrows et al .",
    "edge - on circumstellar disk sources have been discovered in the orion nebula ( mccaughrean & odell 1996 ) and in the taurus tassociation ( e.g. , burrows et al .  1996 , lucas & roche 1997 , padgett et al .  1999 , koresko 1998 , stapelfeldt et al .",
    "1998 , monin & bouvier 2000 ) .",
    "it has already become apparent that different environments affect the evolution of circumstellar disks in various ways . in dense regions with many hot , luminous early type stars like ,",
    "e.g. , the trapezium cluster in orion or the starburst cluster ngc 3603 , the harsh radiation environment leads to a rapid photoevaporation of circumstellar disks ( odell et al .",
    "1993 ; mccullough et al .  1995 ;",
    "strzer & hollenbach 1999 ; brandner et al.2000 ) .",
    "the low - density taurus tassociation , on the other hand , is a more benign environment . because of the high multiplicity among ttauri stars in taurus ( ghez et al .",
    "1993 , leinert et al .",
    "1993 , khler & leinert 1998 ) , however , the majority of circumstellar disks might be affected by tidal truncation , like , e.g. , hk tau / c ( koresko 1998 , stapelfeldt et al .",
    "1998 ) or hv tau c ( monin & bouvier 2000 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 ophiuchi molecular cloud complex is the formation site of a proto - open cluster with a gaseous mass of around 550m@xmath2 ( wilking & lada 1983 ) and at least 100 stellar members ( comern et al .  1993 ; barsony et al .  1997 ; kenyon et al .",
    "its stellar density is intermediate between that of the taurus tassociation and the trapezium cluster .",
    "the absence of hot , luminous early - type stars ensures that circumstellar disks are not subject to photoevaporation .",
    "the @xmath0 oph region appears to be a more typical representative of the dominant star formation mode in the galaxy than the low density environment of the wide - spread taurus t association with its high percentage of binary and multiple systems .    in an effort",
    "to identify spatially resolved circumstellar disks in various environments , we carried out a vlt / isaac survey of southern starforming regions ( zinnecker et al .",
    "1999 ) . the survey also aimed at establishing a sample of circumstellar disk sources which are suitable for detailed follow - up studies with the vlt - interferometer and the atacama large millimeter array .",
    "near - infrared j [ 1.111.39@xmath3 m ] , h [ 1.501.80@xmath3 m ] , and ks [ 2.032.30@xmath3 m ] broad - band images of young stellar sources in southern star forming regions were obtained on 28 april 1999 with the eso vlt / ut1 ( `` antu '' ) and the facility infrared spectrometer and array camera ( isaac , moorwood et al .",
    "the observations were carried out with the short - wavelength channel of isaac , which is equipped with a 1024@xmath51024 hawaii rockwell hgcdte array .",
    "the pixel scale was 0147 pixel@xmath6 and the seeing was @xmath7035 ( fwhm ) in ks .",
    "two fields were centered between elias 29 and wl 19 , and between wly 43 and 44 , respectively .",
    "total exposure times were 240s in h and 120s in ks for the elias 29/wl 19 field , and 640s in j , 320s in h , and 150s in ks for the wly 43/44 field .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] illustrates the location of the two isaac pointings .",
    "two bipolar reflection nebulosities intersected by dark lanes were detected .",
    "the objects closely resemble edge - on circumstellar disk sources in taurus and orion , and in the following we refer to them as `` disk 1 '' and `` disk 2 '' .",
    "a close - up of the two new edge - on disk sources , and a comparison to edge - on disks in taurus is presented in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "absolute positions were determined using 2mass data products and relative offsets measured on the isaac frames .",
    "the photometric calibration is based on the observations of infrared standard stars , and photometric measurements from the 2mass point source catalog .",
    "coordinates and near - infrared photometry of the disk sources are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     motte et al .",
    "( 1998 ) identify crbr 2422.8@xmath13423 as an unresolved 1.3 mm continuum source with a peak flux beam@xmath6 of 40@xmath810mjy .",
    "this corresponds to a mass of 0.01m@xmath2 for the disk and the infalling envelope , again in good agreement with the mass of the `` minimum solar nebula '' .",
    "the deep subaru / cisco k-band imaging reveals another source with a bipolar reflection nebulosity @xmath740@xmath9 to the north of disk 1 ( figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this object has previously been detected at infrared and radio wavelengths ( lfam 26  leous et al .",
    "1991 ; [ gy92 ] 197  greene & young 1992 ; crbr 2403.7@xmath12948  comern et al .",
    "1993 ; [ sks95 ] 162403.8 - 242948  strom et al .  1995 ) .",
    "motte et al .",
    "( 1998 ) measure a peak flux beam@xmath6 of 75@xmath810mj at 1.3 mm .",
    "the disk / envelope around lfam 26 thus appears to be the most massive among the three ophiuchus sources discussed in this letter . the wide dust lane and the fact that a central point source is visible distinguishes this source from the two edge - on disks .",
    "the two best studied examples for edge - on circumstellar disks are hh 30 ( burrows et al .",
    "1996 , stapelfeldt et al .  1998 ) and iras 04302 + 2247 ( lucas & roche 1998 , padgett et al .",
    "1999 ) . with a 1.3 mm continuum flux of 35mjy ( reipurth et al .  1983 ) , the amount of circumstellar dust in hh 30 is comparable to crbr 2422.8@xmath13423 , and somewhat less than in ophe - mm3 . the disk and envelope of iras 04302@xmath102247 ( f@xmath11 = 150 mjy at 1.1 mm , hogerheijde et al .",
    "1997 ) is 3 to 4 times more massive .",
    "the peak surface brightness ratio of the two parts of the bipolar reflection nebulosity of hh 30 in the hst / nicmos f204 m filter is 3.7 to 1 , i.e. , intermediate between ophe - mm3 and crbr 2422.8@xmath13423 .",
    "the inclination angle of the disk of hh 30 with respect to the line of sight as derived by burrows et al .",
    "( 1996 ) is @xmath1210@xmath13 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] illustrates the morphology of four edge - on circumstellar disk sources .",
    "iras 04302@xmath102247 is more extended and appears to be in an earlier evolutionary stage than the ` bare - disk ' system hh 30 .",
    "similar to hh 30 , the disk of ophe - mm3 exhibits a hint of flaring , whereas the central dust lane of crbr 2422.8@xmath13423 is flat .",
    "the extended reflection nebulosities outline the interface between an outflow cavity and the infalling circumstellar envelope ( see , e.g. , wilkin & stahler 1998 ) .",
    "like iras 04302@xmath102247 , ophe - mm3 and crbr 2422.8@xmath13423 are more deeply embedded and thus appear to be younger than hh 30 , which has already lost most of its envelope material .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] displays the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of crbr 2422.8@xmath13423 and hh 30 for wavelengths between 1@xmath3 m and 1.3 mm .",
    "while both sources have very similar k band brightness and exhibit about the same 1.3 mm continuum flux , the overall shape of the sed is vastly different .",
    "the sed of crbr 2422.8@xmath13423 is rising steeply in the nir , peaks at around 5@xmath3 m , and is slowly declining towards longer wavelengths . a sharp dip in the sed is apparent at 9.6@xmath3 m .",
    "the data confirm the classification of crbr 2422.8@xmath13423 as a class i source as suggested by motte et al .",
    "the sed of hh 30 peaks at around 2@xmath3 m and shows a shallow and very broad dip around 10@xmath3 m .    as a preparation for the iso and sirtf missions , boss & yorke ( 1996 ) carried out extensive radiative hydrodynamical simulations to study the effect of disk geometry and physical parameters like disk mass , stellar mass , dust opacity , or accretion rate on the sed of circumstellar disks .",
    "the inclination of a disk to the line of sight has a strong impact on the overall sed .",
    "close to edge - on , a disk source is almost entirely seen in scattered light out to wavelengths of 20@xmath3 m .",
    "edge - on orientation also causes the ice band at 3@xmath3 m and the silicate feature at 10@xmath3 m to be seen in emisison .",
    "millimeter fluxes are hardly affected by the disk s inclination . for a less edge - on inclination the circumstellar envelope and the outer parts of the disk become optically thin in the mid - infrared , and continuum emission from the warm , inner disk is detected . as a consequence",
    ", the silicate feature can be seen in absorption .",
    "the simulations by boss & yorke ( 1996 ) also indicate that the silicate absorption feature becomes more pronounced with increasing disk mass , as a higher disk mass leads to a higher central plane temperature of the inner disk .",
    "the simulations nicely explain the sed of the edge - on disk sources crbr 2422.8@xmath13423 and hh 30 .",
    "hh 30 is seen so close to edge - on that only scattered light is detected out to a wavelength of 10@xmath3 m . both the faintness of hh 30 and the limited spectral resolution of the isocam bands might contribute to a non - detection of a silicate emission feature .",
    "the disk of crbr 2422.8@xmath13423 is oriented less edge - on , and the warm , inner disk can be detected in the mid - infrared .",
    "the sharp dip at 9.6@xmath3 m in the sed of crbr 2422.8@xmath13423 is due to silicates seen against the continuum emission from the warm , inner disk .",
    "the observations thus confirm theoretical predictions on the effect of disk geometry and disk inclination on the spectral appearance of a young stellar object .",
    "we have presented the first identification of edge - on circumstellar disks outside of the orion and taurus star forming regions .",
    "compared to the majority of edge - on circumstellar disk sources in taurus , the two edge - on disks in the ophiuchus region appear to be at an earlier evolutionary stage , as they are still more deeply embedded in their circumstellar envelopes .",
    "the high - spatial resolution infrared data confirm that the difference in the spectral energy distribution of crbr 2422.8@xmath13423 and hh 30 is due to a slight difference in the inclination of the disks to the line of sight , as had been predicted previously by theoretical models .",
    "we would like to thank the subaru telescope and vlt staff members for their excellent work , and the referee dr .  k.r .",
    "stapelfeldt for his critical and helpful comments .",
