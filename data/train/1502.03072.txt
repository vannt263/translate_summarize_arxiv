    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) represent a stage in the evolution of initial @xmath51 - 8 @xmath1 stars . at the end of their evolution ,",
    "such stars evolve into asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , then pne , and finally white dwarves ( wd ) . during this process of evolution",
    ", these stars eject a large fraction of their mass into the interstellar medium .",
    "the history of the progenitors is imprinted in the central star of the pn ( cspn ) and the ejected gas .",
    "an investigation of the cspn and the ejected material provides useful information to increase our understanding of stellar evolution , as well as the chemical evolution of galaxies , i.e. , how much of the mass of the star becomes a pn , which and how much of the elements are synthesized in the inner core of the progenitor , and how galaxies become chemically rich .",
    "the ejected gas in the pne consists of both processed and unprocessed matter : primordial sources of proto - star cluster clouds or intracluster medium , pollution sources from highly evolved stars agb and supernovae ( sne ) , and the result of stellar evolution processes ( nucleosynthesized elements , molecules , and dust ) .",
    "our understanding of the evolution of low - mass stars formed in the early galaxy , as well as the chemical evolution of the galaxy , can be enhanced by studying metal - poor pne located in the galactic halo .",
    "fourteen galactic halo pne have been identified since the discovery of k648 in m15 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , the number of detections has steadily increased due to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "five pne are located in the globular clusters ( gcs ) m15 ( k648 ) , m22 ( gjjc1 and m2 - 29 ) , pal6 ( jafu1 ) , and ngc6441 ( jafu2 ) , and others are located in the galactic halo field .",
    "the classification of pne based on chemical abundances was originally proposed by @xcite , and has recently been revised and updated , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "halo pne are classified as typeiv ; specifically , @xcite indicated that halo pne exhibit a large vertical distance from the galactic plane ( @xmath6 = 7.2 kpc ) and large peculiar velocity relative to the rotation of the galaxy ( @xmath7 = 173 km s@xmath8 , see their table  6 ) . among halo pne ,",
    "h4 - 1 @xcite , bobn1 @xcite , and k648 @xcite are extremely metal - poor and c - rich ( @xmath9[ar / h]@xmath10 = 2.03 , @xmath9c / o@xmath10 = 14.49 ; this work ) ; furthermore , there is an unresolved issue in terms of the chemical abundances : how did these progenitors evolve into c - rich pne ?",
    "the scientific backgrounds of these pne were explained by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "the progenitors of these three halo pne were probably @xmath50.8 @xmath1 stars , corresponding to the typical mass of turn - off stars in m15 , because the [ ar / h ] abundances as a metallicity indicator are similar to the typical [ fe / h ] abundance in m15 ; according to @xcite , [ ar / h]@xmath52.03 corresponds to [ fe / h]@xmath52.3 .",
    "at least some of the stars of the milky way s stellar halo were accreted along with their parent dwarf galaxies .",
    "bobn1 , a member of the oldest population in the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy @xcite and h4 - 1 in the halo field , might be younger than the classical milky way stellar halo population .    for low - mass stars to evolve into c - rich pne ,",
    "a third dredge - up ( tdu ) is essential during the thermal pulse ( tp ) agb phase .",
    "tdu conveys the he - shell reaction products , including c , o , ne , and neutron ( @xmath11 ) capture elements , to the stellar surface .",
    "it is widely believed that @xmath121 - 1.5 @xmath1 stars experience tdu ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently @xcite reported the occurrence of tdu in initial 0.9 @xmath1 stars with a metallicity of @xmath13 = 10@xmath14 , although the minimum mass required for tdu depends on the model used .",
    "even if tdu took place in the @xmath50.9 @xmath1 progenitors , the post - agb evolution of such low - mass stars toward the hot wds is very slow . in addition",
    ", the ejected mass itself is very small , so it is difficult to observe them as visible pne .",
    "hence , the most likely explanation is that these progenitors gained mass via binary interactions to create new conditions for evolving into c - rich pne .    in view of the internal kinematics and nebular morphology",
    ", the progenitor of k648 appears to be a high - mass star .",
    "k648 has bipolar and equatorial outflows @xcite and asymmetric nebulae @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ hst_ha ] , we show an h@xmath15 image of k648 obtained using the _ hst_/wfpc2 . this image was processed using lucy - richardson deconvolution .",
    "k648 is composed of three parts : a very bright inner elliptical shell , an outer elliptical shell , and a bright arc on the northwestern limit of the major axis of the nebula , located just inside the edge of the outer bright elliptical shell . the arc is especially prominent in this object .",
    "a corresponding feature at the other end of the major axis does not appear to be present , although two fairly bright red giant branch ( rgb ) stars are unfortunately superposed at this location , making it difficult to resolve this feature .",
    "the locations of these rgb stars are indicated by the white arrows in the figure .",
    "the faint halo surrounding the outer elliptical shell extends to a radius of @xmath52.1 ( not shown here , see fig .  2 of",
    "the major axis of the inner and outer shells is along the position angle of 27@xmath16 .",
    "@xcite theoretically predicted that bipolar nebulae can be created in initial @xmath171.3 @xmath1 single stars .",
    "we will explore the possibility of a binary system related mass - transfer activity suggested by @xcite , to solve the c abundance problem and the apparent contradiction in the evolutionary timescale .",
    "it would be interesting to study whether an increased mass star would evolve into a c - rich pn through such an evolutionary route .",
    "in agb nucleosynthesis models , the predicted abundances , in particular @xmath11-capture elements , depend on the tdu efficiency , the number of thermal pulses , and the @xmath18c pocket mass .",
    "any @xmath11-capture elements have not yet been detected in k648 .",
    "the ne abundance is also sensitive to the amount of @xmath18c pocket mass @xcite .",
    "the ne abundances can be easily determined using atomic gas phase emissions from the pne rather than stellar absorption . to obtain a detailed view of the origin and evolution of k648 through comparison with agb nucleosynthesis models",
    ", we must accurately determine the abundances of c , o , ne , and @xmath11-capture elements , and estimate the ejected mass .",
    "k648 is an ideal laboratory in which to investigate the evolution of low - mass metal - poor stars , as well as their nucleosynthesis .",
    "the reasons for this are first that the upper mass limit of stars in m15 is known ( @xmath191.6 @xmath1 ) , and second that , because the distances are known with relatively little uncertainty , it is possible to determine the core - mass of the pn as well as of the ejected mass .",
    "study of k648 benefits not only understanding of the evolution of low - mass metal - poor stars , but also dust production in these stars .    in this paper",
    ", we describe detailed spectroscopic analyses of k648 to investigate the origin and evolution of this pn based on an extensive set of spectroscopic / photometric data from the far - uv to far - infrared ( fir ) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe these observations using the subaru / hds , _",
    "hst_/wfpc2/fos / cos , _",
    "spitzer_/irs / irac / mips , and _ herschel_/pacs . in section 3 , we provide the elemental abundances of the nebula and the cspn , as well as the physical properties of the cspn .",
    "we determined the abundances of the 10 elements of the nebula of k648 , including the first measurements of the @xmath11-capture element fluorine ( f ) in this pn . using the spectrum synthesis code tlusty @xcite , we determined the abundances of 7 elements of the cspn and the core - mass of the cspn .",
    "we also report the c - rich dust features found in the _ spitzer_/irs spectrum .",
    "we constructed a self - consistent model , whereby the predicted spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fits the observations and accordingly estimated the mass of ejected gas and dust using the radiative transfer code cloudy @xcite . in section 4",
    ", we compare the elemental abundances of k648 with those of h4 - 1 and bobn1 .",
    "we discuss the origin and evolution of k648 by comparing the predicted elemental abundances , the final core - mass , and the ejected mass reported by @xcite with our determined values .",
    "a summary is presented in section 5 .",
    "optical high - dispersion spectra were obtained using a high - dispersion spectrograph ( hds ; * ? ? ? * ) attached to the nasmyth focus of the 8.2-m subaru telescope on 2012 june 28 ( program i d : s12a-078 , pi : m.  otsuka ) .",
    "the weather conditions were stable and clear throughout the night , and the seeing was @xmath50.5 measured using the guider ccd .",
    "an atmospheric dispersion corrector ( adc ) was used to minimize the differential atmospheric dispersion throughout the broad wavelength region .",
    "the slit width was set to 1.2 and the slit length was set to 6 ; these settings allowed us to reduce contamination from nearby stars .",
    "we selected 2@xmath22 on - chip binning .",
    "the resolving power ( @xmath20 ) was 33500 , determined from the average full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of over 600 th - ar comparison lines .",
    "blue - cross and the red - cross dispersers were employed to obtain the 3620 - 5400 spectrum ( blue spectrum ) and the 4320 - 7140 spectrum ( red spectrum ) , respectively .",
    "we set the position angle to 27@xmath16 using an image de - rotator .",
    "the total exposure times were 7200 s for the blue spectrum and 9000 s for the red spectrum , respectively .",
    "flux calibration , blaze function correction and airmass correction were carried out by observing the standard star bd+28@xmath16 4211 twice at different airmasses for each blue and red spectrum .",
    "data reduction was carried out using the echelle spectra reduction package echelle in iraf .",
    "we generated a single 3620 - 7140 spectrum by combining the blue and the red spectra after scaling the flux density of the blue spectrum by a factor of 1.06 to match that of the red spectrum .",

    "this progenitor passed through the agb phase stage , and finally became the presently observable c - rich pn k648 .",
