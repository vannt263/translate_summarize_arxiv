    "frster resonance energy transfer , or fret , is a fluorescence technique commonly used to access spatial information on length scales smaller than the diffraction limit of light @xcite . in standard fluorescence",
    ", illuminating light is used to excite a fluorophore into a higher energy state , and the fluorophore subsequently relaxes into its ground state either by emitting a photon or through a non - radiative decay pathway . if another fluorophore is near , typically within @xmath0 10 nm , the two fluorophores can interact through dipole - dipole interactions termed fret .",
    "fret confers an additional decay path where the excited florophore , termed the donor , can transfer its energy to the nearby , unexcited fluorophore , termed the acceptor , which can then release the energy as a photon or through non - radiative decay . as the emission spectra of commonly used donor and acceptor pairs are spectrally distinct , one common method of measuring the the average fret efficiency is to compare the relative intensities collected from the two channels .",
    "however , this method has drawbacks including spectral bleed - through and a sensitivity to changes in fluorophore concentration and excitation light intensity @xcite .    as an alternative to using fluorescence intensity to quantify fret , fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy , or flim ,",

    ", a narrow pulse of light is used to excite fluorophores into an excited state .",
    "fluorophores that decay from their excited states can do so by releasing a photon .",
    "a subset of the released photons are detected , and for each detected photon , the arrival time is measured relative to the excitation pulse .",
    "the amount of time fluorophores spend in their excited state depends on the number of decay paths available .",
    "donor fluorophores are chosen such that when they decay from their excited states , they do so at a constant rate , leading to photon emission time distributions that are exponential with a single characteristic decay time .",
    "this characteristic decay time is known as the fluorescence lifetime and is typically on the order of nanosconds .",
    "when donor fluorophores are undergoing fret , they will spend , on average , a shorter amount of time in their excited states , leading to a reduced lifetime . in a sample",
    "where only a fraction of donor fluorophores are undergoing fret , the photon emission time distribution will be the sum of two exponentials with different lifetimes . by comparing the amplitudes of these two exponentials , the relative fraction of donors undergoing",
    "fret can be measured . in practice ,",
    "additional complications are present , including photons collected from spurious background and time delays introduced by the collection system itself .",
    "these effects must be accounted for to infer the relative amplitudes and lifetimes of the emitted photon distributions from the measured photon arrival time histograms .",
    "several approaches have been used in order to estimate these parameters , including least - squares fitting @xcite , phasor methods @xcite , and bayesian approaches @xcite , each with their own advantages and disadvantages .    here",
    "we utilize and extend the bayesian approach previously described @xcite to take into account additional experimental factors and test the performance of our method using experimental data .",

    "flim measurements , a narrow laser pulse is used to excite fluorophores in the sample , and the arrival times of photons emitted from the fluorophores are recorded .",
    "fluorophores undergoing fret will have a shorter florescence lifetime compared with fluorophores not undergoing fret .",
    "when only a fraction of fluorophores in the sample are undergoing fret , the resulting distribution of photon emission will be a sum of exponentials , where each exponential has a different lifetime , and each exponential is weighted by the number of photons collected from the respective source .",
    "in addition , there exists a constant background of photons due to noise in the detector and stray light , taken to be from a uniform distribution . in the following ,",
    "we consider photons from each of these sources separately and construct the likelihood function as follows ,    @xmath7    where t is the arrival time of a photon relative to the excitation pulse , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are respectively the short and long fluorescence lifetimes , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the fractions of photons from the short and long lifetime distributions respectively , @xmath12 is the fraction of photons from the uniform background given by @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 is the probability of the photon arriving at time t given that the photon originates from fraction @xmath15 .",
    "equation [ eq : continuous likelihood ] represents the likelihood model when time is taken to be continuous .",
    "however , in practice , photon arrival times collected with tcspc are discretized into bins , and this discretization must be taken into account .",
    "if the bins are numbered sequentially and of width @xmath16 , such that @xmath17 represents the bin containing photons with arrival time , @xmath18 , then the likelihood function becomes ,    @xmath19^{p_{i } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , eqn .",
    "[ discreet_likelihood ] serves as the discrete form of the likelihood function , eqn .",
    "[ eq : continuous likelihood ] .",
    "one complexity in experimental tcspc measurements is that a delay is introduced to photon arrival times , termed the instrument response function ( irf ) . in order to account for this effect ,",
    "the irf was experimentally measured ( see flim measurements ) .",
    "the measured irf is then convolved with the idealized probability density functions for the exponential distributions in order to construct the likelihood function . taking this effect into account leads to ,    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the idealized exponential distribution , taken to be @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is an index labeling the exponential distribution and @xmath24 is the experimentally measured instrument response function .",

    "the probability of measuring a photon at time t , given a decay lifetime , @xmath28 , is given by , @xmath29 where @xmath28 is the lifetime of the fluorophore . in practice , many sequential excitation pulses are used , and it s possible that a fluorophore excited by a given pulse does nt emit a photon until after a future pulse . taking this effect into account for a single exponential decay leads to @xcite , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the excitation pulse period and @xmath32 is an index counting previous pulses .",

    "in a sample where only a subset of fluorophores are undergoing fret , photon emission distributions take the form of a biexponential distribution , with some fraction of the distribution consisting of photons from a short - lifetime exponential , another fraction consisting of photons from a long - lifetime exponential , and some fraction coming from a spurrious background distribution .",

    "consequently , in this regime it can be difficult to extract accurate estimates of the fraction of short - lifetime photons though methods that rely on histogram fitting .",

    ", fluorescence lifetime measurements were taken using erythrosin b and coumarin 153 , two reference dyes with well characterized lifetimes of 0.47 @xmath44 0.02 ns and 4.3 @xmath44 0.2 ns respectively @xcite .",
    "these dyes were mixed at a fixed ratio , and fluorescence lifetime measurements were taken ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2]a , materials and methods ) in order to generate a master list of photon arrival times .",
    "a fixed number of photons were randomly sampled from the master list in order to construct a histogram of photon arrival times , and analyzed to infer an estimate of the fraction of short - lifetime fluorophores , @xmath10 , taken as either the mean or the mode of the posterior distribution .",
    "this process was repeated 300 times in order to produce an error estimate for each given photon count , and was repeated for total photon counts spanning @xmath0 3 orders of magnitude ( fig [ fig : figure2]b ) .",
    "we find good agreement between the estimates of the fraction of short - lifetime photons for total photons counts larger than @xmath0 200 photons , using either the posterior mean or posterior mode as a fraction estimate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2]b ) . slight discrepancies between estimates using the posterior mean and posterior mode are apparent due to truncation and the fact that the posterior distribution is skewed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1]b ) , and thus in general the mode and the mean of the distribution are not equal . as a measure of the error in our parameter estimation , we compute the standard deviation of the estimates from the 300 numerical replicates ( fig . [",

    "all data points except for the four smallest photon counts yields an exponent of @xmath45 ( 95% confidence interval ) , consistent with the exponent of @xmath46 predicted from the central limit theorem in the limit of high @xmath41 .",
    "we next tested our results in the regime where a relatively large number of photons are collected , but the fraction of photons originating from the short - lifetime component is low .",
    "this regime is relevant in systems where a large number of donor molecules are present , but interactions leading to fret are relatively rare . in order to test the performance of our algorithm in this regime ,",
    "fluorescence lifetime measurements were taken of erythrosin b and coumarin 153 as representative short- and long - lifetime dyes respectively .",
    "unlike the measurements taken in the low - photon regime , separate fluorescence lifetime measurements were taken for each dye , generating separate master photon histograms ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3]a ) .",
    "a fixed number of photons could then be numerically sampled from each master histogram in order to create test histograms containing a prescribed fraction of photons originating from the short - lifetime dye , which were then analyzed in order to estimate the short - lifetime fraction .",
    "data was collected at @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 counts per second , corresponding to low , medium , and high intensity respectively , and histograms from each intensity were analyzed separately .",
    "photons were sampled from master curves such that the total number of photons was fixed at @xmath50 , with a prescribed fraction of photons originating from the short - lifetime distribution .",
    "this process was repeated 100 times for each condition . across orders of magnitude ,",
    "the short - lifetime fraction estimated from our algorithm varies linearly with the prescribed short - lifetime fraction ( fig .",

    "the estimated short - lifetime fraction differs from the known short - lifetime fraction by a small bias factor , evident by the small positive offsets in the linear fits ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3]b , inset ) .",
    "we hypothesize that this offset may be due to a number of factors , including non - monoexponential photon emission from the dyes , slight mischaracterization of the lifetimes or the instrument response function , or an intensity dependence of the flim measurement system .",
    "while the magnitude of the bias varies with intensity , the magnitude of the bias is relatively small , overestimating the fraction by less than one percent for the highest intensity tested .    .",

    "thus , we next considered the accuracy of measuring changes in the short - lifetime fraction , which were derived from the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3]b by subtracting values adjacent on the short - lifetime fraction axis .",
    "while the estimated short - lifetime fractions contain a small bias ( fig [ fig : figure3]b ) , the bias is largely removed when changes in short - lifetime fraction are considered ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3]c ) .",
    "consistent with this removal of bias , fitting linear equations to the estimated changes in short lifetime fraction vs. prescribed short lifetime fraction gives slopes of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , and offsets of @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 for low , medium , and high intensities respectively ( 95% confidence interval ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3]c ) .",
    "these results demonstrate the accuracy and precision of our method for measuring changes in short - lifetime fraction across many orders of magnitude . for a short - lifetime fraction of @xmath65 ,",
    "the sample standard deviation decays with increasing photon number . fitting a power law yields an exponent of @xmath64 ( 95% confidence interval ) , consistent with the exponent of @xmath46 predicted from the central limit theorem and as was the case for the low - photon regime measurements ( fig [ fig : figure2]c ) .",
    "here we presented an extension of previous bayesian inference approaches to flim data analysis that takes into account additional experimental complexities . using controlled experimental data as a test case ,",
    "we show that this analysis performs remarkably well in both the low - photon and low - fraction regimes .    in the low - photon regime , we can estimate the low - lifetime fraction , @xmath10 , with a precision of 0.003 and a bias of 0.017 using only 200 photons . at a photon collection rate of @xmath66 photons per second",
    ", this number of photons corresponds to an acquisition time of only 1 millisecond .",
    "as the precision scales as @xmath67 ( fig [ fig : figure2]c ) , if one instead wanted a higher precision of 0.001 , one could instead collect data for 9 milliseconds . in the low - fraction regime , using @xmath68 photons , for a short - lifetime fraction , @xmath10 , of 0.0156",
    ", we find a precision of 0.000096 and a bias of 0.0046 . with an acquisition rate of @xmath69 photons per second , this corresponds to @xmath0 33 seconds of acquisition time .",
    "as the precision in this regime also scales @xmath67 ( fig [ fig : figure3]c ) , if one requires a higher precision of 0.000032 , this could be obtained by acquiring data for nine times as long , or 300 seconds .",
    "thus , in both the low - photon and low - fraction regimes , our results show the required number of photons , and hence the acquisition time , necessary to achieve a given level of precision .",
    "one limitation of our implementation is that we evaluate the posterior distribution at equally spaced points .",
    "a large parameter space must be searched , and the analysis presented here is relatively slow compared to other parameter searching techniques .",
    "for example , when 4 parameters are searched using a markov chain monte carlo approach to stochastically optimize our likelihood , the computation time is reduced by a factor of @xmath010 - 20 with no loss of accuracy ( fig . [",
    "fig : sfigure4 ] ) .",
    "here we have focused on the use of flim to measure changes in fret , yet it has wider applications , including in metabolic imaging @xcite and in measuring local changes in environment , including ph @xcite as well as oxygen @xcite and zn@xmath70 @xcite concentrations .",
    "the analysis presented here is general , and should be applicable to flim measurements in these other systems as well .",
    "a limitation of the becker & hickl system used here is that it can not record photon arrival times for the entire collection period .",
    "in addition , time bins can be artificially removed from analysis to preferentially remove contaminating factors neglected in the analysis .",
    "for example , biological samples such as _ xenopus laevis _",
    "oocyte extracts can contain endogenous fluorophores with a lifetime significantly shorter than the donor lifetime .",
    "photons collected from these endogenous fluorophores have a large contribution to early time bins and thus removal of these bins preferentially removes their effects .",
