    "the two - component model of p - p collisions describes final - state hadrons as arising from a combination of longitudinal ( along beam direction ) string fragmentation ( soft ) described by the lund string - fragmentation model  @xcite and transverse parton fragmentation ( hard ) described by fragmentation functions derived from deep - inelastic scattering  @xcite . in this context",
    "we have studied two - particle correlations for unidentified hadrons from 200 gev p - p collisions observed with the star detector at rhic  @xcite .",
    "we find that the two components are easily separated by means of a cut space defined on transverse rapidity .",

    "single - particle momentum space for high - energy nuclear collisions can be represented by kinematic variables @xmath5 relative to the collision axis , where @xmath6 is transverse momentum , @xmath7 is transverse mass , @xmath8 is transverse rapidity assuming pion mass @xmath9 for all particles , @xmath1 is the pseudorapidity , and @xmath2 is the momentum azimuth angle .",
    "the full two - particle momentum space @xmath10 can be decomposed into subspaces represented by cartesian products such as transverse - rapidity space @xmath3 .",
    "that space , in addition to revealing its own interesting correlation structure , serves as a cut space to isolate soft and hard components for further study in complementary _ axial _ momentum subspaces @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "pair - number ratio histograms @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a normalized pair - number histogram for sibling ( same event ) or mixed ( different events ) pairs , are formed on each two - particle momentum subspace .",

    "the two - particle correlation structure of the hadron distribution from p - p collisions at 200 gev can be separated into hard and soft components based on a simple cut at @xmath26 ( @xmath27 gev / c ) .",

    "the correlation structure is determined by local momentum and charge conservation which are manifested by charge - independent and charge - dependent structures .",
    "the hard component represents transverse parton fragmentation and also has charge - dependent ( not considered here ) and charge - independent manifestations .",
    "the jet - related ci angular correlations are determined by momentum conservation during initial hard scattering and fragmentation of the struck partons ( or rather the excited color singlets which evolve from those partons ) .",
    "the several two - particle data distributions have been represented by simple parameterized model functions .",
    "the model parameters reported in this short summary should be regarded as preliminary . in some cases comparison",
    "has been made to the pythia monte carlo simulation and to data from the isr at lower energies .",
    "these preliminary data and the pythia monte carlo are in qualitative agreement , but there are significant quantitative differences that will be reported in a more comprehensive study .",
    "this minimum - bias representation of p - p correlation structure at 200 gev is an essential reference for a - a collisions at rhic ."
