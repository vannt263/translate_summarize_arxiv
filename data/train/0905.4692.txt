    "for instance , the identity , which corresponds experimentally to not acting on the state , can be clearly regarded as very accurate . in this letter , we show that , when the channel is non - maximally entangled , the average fidelity of teleportation can be maximized by a proper selection of the basis used by alice to perform her measurement .",

    "in order to teleport reliably the unknown state of a qubit @xmath0 from alice to bob , an entangled resource has to be shared by them .",
    "let us assume that the state of qubit @xmath0 is pure ( the generalization to a mixed case is , however , straightforward ) , and equal to @xmath1 with @xmath2 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we start by considering that alice and bob share a pure non - maximally entangled state ( this condition is relaxed in sec .  [ mixed ] ) . a general pure entangled state of two qubits can be written , in an appropriate basis , as @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 label alice s and bob s qubit , respectively , and @xmath6 $ ] is a parameter measuring the amount of entanglement present in the channel ( related to schmidt coefficients ) .",
    "alice can perform two - qubit measurements on qubits @xmath0 ( whose initial state has to be teleported ) and @xmath4 .",
    "the total state of the system can be cast as @xmath7 let us suppose now that , instead of using the standard basis of bell states , alice performs her measurement in the non - maximally entangled orthogonal basis @xmath8 , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 $ ] . if @xmath12 , it is possible to achieve the teleportation of the unknown state @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ statet ] ) with unit fidelity , even though the probability is lower than one whenever @xmath14 , i.e. , the shared resource is non - maximally entangled  @xcite .",
    "this is known in literature as probabilistic quantum teleportation . _ here , however , we focus our analysis on the maximization of the fidelity for the deterministic scheme_. with the aforementioned basis , the states @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be written as @xmath19 the total state of the system can thus be recast as @xmath20 after the measurement performed by alice on qubits @xmath0 and @xmath4 in the basis @xmath8 , bob applies a single - qubit operation on @xmath5 , depending on the result obtained by alice , as shown in the following table : @xmath21 for @xmath22 , the protocol reduces to the standard one : the state of qubit @xmath5 after the conditional operation is exactly the same as the initial one of qubit @xmath0 , independently of the result of alice s measurement . for @xmath23 , the state @xmath24 is perfectly teleported only when alice measures qubits @xmath0 and @xmath4 in the state @xmath25 or @xmath26 , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "_ so far , we have assumed that the conditional operations can be performed ideally by bob . in what follows",
    ", we extend the investigation to cases where this is no longer true_. the formal description of specific errors affecting the output state of @xmath5 after inaccurate operations is related to the physical implementation of the qubits . in order to obtain an analysis that is independent of the particular experimental setting ,",
    "let us start describing these errors in the following general and yet interesting way ( different models are considered in sec .",
    "[ mixed ] ) : for a generic state , represented by the density matrix @xmath27 , the result of an imperfect operation corresponds to the action of decoherence through a depolarizing channel on the output of the ideal operation @xmath28 . in an operator - sum representation ,",
    "the final state @xmath29 after the action of decoherence is thus @xmath30 with @xmath31 the set of kraus operators corresponding to the specific channel , such that @xmath32  @xcite",
    ". for a depolarizing channel , we have @xmath33 moreover , we consider that @xmath34 depends on the conditional operation to be performed . in this way , we take into account the possibility that some operations can be more reliable than others .",
    "this can be justified by the fact that different operations require different times to be performed . even in the case where , instead of applying the conditional operation , one simply rotates the basis of the subsequent operations , this can lead to a different value of @xmath34 for each rotation .",
    "specifically , the effect of non - ideal operations on qubit @xmath5 is summarized in the following table  @xcite : @xmath35    it is known that the effect of fluctuating birefringence in optical fibers can be formally described as a depolarizing channel affecting the polarization of the input light pulse  @xcite .",
    "likewise , the model we propose is particularly interesting in the context of qip with nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr )  @xcite . due to the macroscopic nature of the samples , in nmr experiments the standard projective measurements needed for qip are replaced by ensemble averages  @xcite .",
    "this means that , instead of pure states , one needs to deal with _ pseudo - pure states _",
    "@xcite of the type @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is an arbitrary pure state in a @xmath39-dimensional space .",
    "this state can be interpreted as a statistical mixture in which only a fraction @xmath40 of the qudits is in the pure state @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the actual value of @xmath40 can depend on the experimental technique used .",
    "whereas in thermally distributed samples @xmath40 can be of the order of @xmath41 @xcite , it can reach values of @xmath42 in experiments on state preparation using parahydrogen and non - thermal techniques @xcite .    in the remainder of the letter",
    "we show that , for the deterministic protocol with this set of non - ideal operations , the maximal fidelity does not necessarily correspond to the constraint @xmath12 .",
    "the state of qubit @xmath5 after bob s conditional operation is not exactly the same as the initial one of qubit @xmath0 . in order to estimate the performance of this teleportation scheme , therefore",
    ", we have to evaluate the fidelity as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the final state of qubit @xmath5 and @xmath45 is the state to teleport .",
    "clearly , the overall fidelity takes into account the different probabilities of the outcomes .",
    "in this section , the average fidelity of teleportation in the protocol described above is analyzed .",

    "this is not unexpected , because _ the effect of changing alice s basis can be seen as a way to enhance the probability to obtain a specific result with respect to the others_. in this way , she is able to  privilege \" the corresponding conditional operation .",
    "if all the operations would give the same error , none of them should be privileged .",

    "this can be explained because , when the reduced density matrix of qubit @xmath5 at the beginning of the protocol corresponds to a totally mixed state ( as in the case of a maximally entangled shared resource ) , there is no way to privilege any operation .",
    "on the other hand , for different values of @xmath63 and @xmath14 , the basis in which alice should perform her measurement is no longer the bell one . in general , the maximum average fidelity is obtained for @xmath66 one can maximize @xmath49 in eq .",

    "however , if additional depolarization comes into play with different strength depending on the measurement outcome , then this is no longer true .",
    "in order to investigate the described protocol in a way so as to be closer to realistic conditions , we consider now cases where the shared resource is not pure .",
