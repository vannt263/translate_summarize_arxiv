    "* ) star surrounded by an accretion disk that evinces a large inner hole as judged from the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ; * ? ? ?",
    "unusually low excess emission at wavelengths @xmath5 @xmath0 m can be modeled with an optically thick disk whose inner edge is located @xmath2 au from the central star . while observations of 10 @xmath0 m silicate emission @xcite together with non - zero excess at 2 @xmath0 m @xcite suggest the presence of at least some dust grains with sizes less than a few microns at stellocentric distances @xmath6 au , this inner disk material appears optically thin , and has been estimated to constitute less than a lunar mass @xcite .",
    "detection of warm gas @xcite and accretion signatures @xcite confirm that the region inside 4 au is not devoid of material .    at @xmath7 au , dust temperatures ( @xmath8 k )",
    "are substantially lower than sublimation temperatures for silicate grains ( @xmath9 k ; e.g. , * ? ?",
    "this suggests the optically thick outer disk is truncated at 4 au by a mechanism other than dust sublimation .",
    "large holes inferred from seds are commonly attributed to planets , which may clear gaps about their orbits .",
    "a planet impedes accretion of material outside its orbit , while inner disk material is free to drain onto the central star @xcite .",
    "however , a viscous outer disk causes inward migration of planets and their associated gaps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , inner holes would be filled in on the viscous timescale unless the disk is less massive than the planet , in which case the timescale is lengthened by the mass ratio between the planet and the disk @xcite . since the outer disk of tw hya is massive ( @xmath10 m@xmath11 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , planets are unlikely to preserve inner clearings over the lifetime of the system ( @xmath4 myr ) unless the outer disk is unusually inviscid ( @xmath12 ; * ? ? ?",
    "an alternative explanation for sed - inferred holes is that dust grains have grown larger than a few microns , depleting the population of small grains that would produce the near - ir emission",
    ". scattered light and long - wavelength emission from the outer ( @xmath13 au ) disk of tw hya suggest substantial grain growth , up to cm sizes @xcite , supporting the hypothesis of grain coagulation . the small amount of sub - micron - sized dust required to explain emission at @xmath5 @xmath0 m and the spectral shape of the 10 @xmath0 m silicate feature @xcite may represent the tail at small sizes of a grain size distribution that peaks at sizes much larger than a micron .",
    "furthermore , as we discuss below , small dust grains are short - lived in the tw hya disk and demand continual replenishment , possibly from collisions of larger parent bodies .",
    "the population of sub - micron - sized dust in the inner disk may not be primordial .",
    "here we present observations with the keck interferometer that spatially resolve the inner disk around tw hya for the first time .",
    "previous observations at sub - millimeter to centimeter wavelengths spatially resolved emission at larger radii ( @xmath14 au ) and enabled powerful constraints on the outer disk structure and dust properties @xcite . with our near - ir interferometric observations , we extend this analysis to the inner disk . by combining spatially resolved measurements with spectral information , we determine the radial distribution , temperature , and approximate grain sizes of dust .",
    "we confirm that the inner disk is populated by small amounts of sub - micron - sized dust , and show that the inner radius au based on previous modeling by @xcite .",
    "] of this optically thin disk occurs further from the star than previous spatially unresolved observations imply .",
    "we observed tw hya near @xmath1-band ( @xmath15 @xmath0 m ; @xmath16 @xmath0 m ) with the keck interferometer ( ki ) on april 21 , 2005 ( ut 20050421 ) .",
    "the ki is a fringe - tracking michelson interferometer that combines light from the two 10-m keck apertures and provides an angular resolution of @xmath17 mas @xcite .",
    "a single 130s observation of tw hya was obtained between observations of three calibrators ( hd 97023 , hd 97940 , and hd 99934 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : rawv2 ] shows the uncalibrated visibilities of the target and calibrators .",
    "data calibration is described by @xcite ; here we summarize the procedure .",
    "we first determine the system visibility ( i.e. , the point source response of the interferometer ) from the weighted mean of observations of unresolved calibrators @xcite . source and calibrator data are corrected for detection biases @xcite and integrated into 5s blocks .",
    "the calibrated @xmath18 for the target source is averaged over all 5s blocks , with uncertainties given by the quadrature addition of the internal scatter and the uncertainty in the system visibility .",
    "the calibrated , normalized , squared visibility measured for tw hya at @xmath19 m@xmath20 ( @xmath21 m , @xmath22 m ) is @xmath23 .",
    "we model our measured @xmath18 together with previous photometric measurements at @xmath245 @xmath0 m @xcite , assuming photometric uncertainties of 10% .",
    "the circumstellar - to - stellar flux ratio is critical for modeling the circumstellar component of the visibility and near - ir sed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the optically thin disk extends from an inner truncation radius , @xmath36 , to an outer radius , @xmath37 .",
    "since most of the near - ir emission is generated close to @xmath36 where the hottest dust resides , our results are insensitive to @xmath37 ; for simplicity , we assume @xmath38 au .",
    "the mass surface density of the inner disk is parameterized as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the stellocentric radius and @xmath41 is the surface density at @xmath42 au .",
    "we assume dust grains are of a single size and adopt a simple prescription for the frequency - dependent dust opacity ,",
    "@xmath43 @xmath44 g@xmath45 . for sub - micron - sized grains , we set @xmath46 and @xmath47 . for larger grains with sizes @xmath48 m , we take @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "these choices are compatible with previous computations of opacities at @xmath515 @xmath0 m by @xcite .",
    "our normalizations are @xmath52 times higher than theirs since our @xmath53 is the dust - mass opacity as opposed to the dust+gas opacity ; i.e. , the units of @xmath53 are @xmath44 per g of dust . we compute the dust temperature under the assumption that the disk is optically thin : @xmath54 the total flux of the inner disk is derived by dividing the disk into annuli , computing the flux for each annulus , and summing the annular fluxes .",
    "similarly , model visibilities are computed for each annulus , and the visibility for the entire inner disk is given by the flux - weighted sum of the annular visibilities .",
    "the flux in an annulus of infinitesimal width @xmath55 is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the planck function and @xmath58 is the vertical optical depth , @xmath59 the normalized visibility for an annulus extending from @xmath60 to @xmath61 is given by the difference of visibilities for uniform disks having radii equal to @xmath60 and @xmath62 : @xmath63.\\ ] ] here @xmath64 m@xmath20 is the @xmath65 radius , @xmath66 is the observing wavelength , and @xmath67 is a first - order bessel function .    the total flux density from the disk and the central star equals @xmath68 the veiling at 2 @xmath0 m is @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the flux density at @xmath71 . the squared visibility of the model at 2 @xmath0 m is @xmath72 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the visibility of the unresolved central star .",
    "we solve for the best - fit parameters of the model by computing the @xmath245 @xmath0 m fluxes , @xmath74 , and @xmath18 for a grid of values of @xmath36 and @xmath41 , and minimizing the @xmath75-residuals between model and data .",
    "uncertainties for best - fit parameters are determined from @xmath75-error ellipses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we do not include @xmath76 or @xmath77 as free parameters and instead consider two model cases : @xmath46 and @xmath78 ( intended to model sub - micron - sized grains ) , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( representing grains sized @xmath4 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "scattered light from the disk is justifiably ignored in our modeling . at @xmath79 and 1.6 @xmath0 m , the disk - scattered flux on angular scales of @xmath80@xmath81",
    "is estimated to comprise 2.4% and 2.1% of the stellar flux , respectively @xcite .",
    "given the blue color and roughly flat surface brightness profile of the scattered light within @xmath82 @xcite , we conclude that the @xmath1-band scattered flux within the 50 mas field of view of ki is @xmath83 .",
    "therefore thermal emission , as traced by the @xmath1-band veiling ( @xmath84 of the stellar flux ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , dominates over any scattered emission .",
    "while we have assumed tw hya is a single star , a low - mass stellar companion could contribute to the near - ir visibilities and sed . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no stellar companions have been detected in previous hst imaging or radial velocity monitoring , and thus the presence of a luminous second star appears unlikely .",
    "additional ki observations , or astrometric and/or radial velocity monitoring could test this possibility definitively .",
    "figure [ fig : mods ] shows the best - fit models for @xmath49 and @xmath85 , together with the @xmath18 and sed data .",
    "best - fit values for @xmath36 and @xmath41 , and their @xmath86 uncertainties are listed in table 1 .",
    "our model can reproduce the ki @xmath18 measurement and near - ir sed of tw hya if @xmath87 and @xmath88 au .",
    "while models with @xmath49 can fit the sed data well ( the larger quantity of sed data relative to the single @xmath18 measurement skews the fits accordingly ) , only @xmath46 models can simultaneously reproduce our @xmath18 measurement . from these best - fit parameter values , we compute the temperature at the inner truncation radius @xmath89 , the dust mass @xmath90 , and the assumed surface density profile",
    ". estimates of @xmath90 are therefore highly uncertain . for comparison , under the assumption of a constant surface density ,",
    "@xcite estimate a dust mass approximately four orders of magnitude higher than the values listed in table [ tab : models ] . ] and the 2 @xmath0 m vertical optical depth at the inner edge @xmath91 .",
    "the inner radius of the optically thin disk ( @xmath92 au ) exceeds that inferred from previous modeling of spatially unresolved data ( 0.02 au ; * ? ? ?",
    "our large inner radius leads to an inner disk temperature lower than expected for dust sublimation ( table 1 ) , suggesting that an alternate truncation mechanism is necessary .",
    "one possibility is that the inner disk extends inward to the magnetospheric radius @xmath93 , where the ram pressure from accretion balances the stellar magnetic pressure .",
    "although hot dust may still exist interior to this radius , its high infall velocity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) implies an optical depth orders of magnitude lower than that of dust outside @xmath93 . assuming an accretion rate of @xmath94 m@xmath11 yr@xmath45 @xcite , stellar magnetic field strength of 2.6 kg @xcite , and stellar parameters from  [ sec : mod ] , we compute @xmath95 au ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is comparable to our best - fit @xmath36 ( with @xmath46 ) , indicating that the optically thin inner disk may indeed be magnetospherically truncated .",
    "the fact that models require @xmath96 to fit the combined @xmath18+sed data indicates that the inner disk contains a population of dust grains having sizes smaller than @xmath97 @xmath0 m .",
    "in fact , we can obtain slightly better fits to our data if we allow @xmath98 , as one might expect if very small grains ( @xmath99 @xmath0 m ) were present @xcite .",
    "sub - micron - sized grains are quickly blown out of the inner disk by stellar radiation pressure .",
    "gas friction mediates dust removal ; unbound grains achieve a terminal outflow velocity equal to the product of the momentum stopping time and the net outward acceleration due to radiation pressure and gravity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "estimates of the gas density are necessary to calculate the survival times of small dust grains . using the measured column density and temperature of h@xmath100 in the inner disk @xcite , accounting for the possibility that the midplane may be up to @xmath101 times denser than the warm surface @xcite , and assuming a hydrostatic disk , we estimate a midplane gas density at 1 au of @xmath102 g @xmath103 .",
    "the stopping time for micron - sized grains at @xmath104 au is @xmath105 yr , the terminal velocity is @xmath106 km s@xmath45 , and the removal time is @xmath107 yr .    small dust grains in the tw hya inner disk survive for @xmath107 yr , and are thus ephemeral over the age of the system . because of the difficulty in transporting sub - micron - sized grains from the outer disk at @xmath108 au to @xmath109 au , we argue that inner disk dust is continually re - generated , possibly by collisions of a swarm of larger parent bodies that also reside in the inner disk .",
    "we observed tw hya with the keck interferometer and found the 2 @xmath0 m emission to be spatially resolved .",
    "we modeled the interferometric data together with previous measurements of the @xmath1-band veiling and near - ir fluxes , and inferred that the inner disk consists of optically thin dust extending from the edge of the optically thick outer disk ( @xmath7 au ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to @xmath110 au of the central star .",
    "this inner radius is larger than expected from dust sublimation ; the truncation may be magnetospheric in origin .",
    "the near - ir emitting dust is composed of sub - micron - sized particles which are extremely short - lived ; this dust may be replenished by erosive collisions of larger parent bodies in the inner disk .    *",
