    "anisotropy is a well known",
    " intrinsic \" feature of several high @xmath0 superconductors that emerges from their crystalline structure .",
    "for example , the critical current along the a - b planes of the structure can be much higher than that along the c - direction @xcite .",
    "that anisotropy is observed in a straightforward fashion in single crystals or epitaxial films .",
    "however , superconducting samples are typically inhomogenous at a morphological level much coarser than the crystals they are made of : bulk superconductors @xcite , wires @xcite , tapes @xcite , and coated superconductors @xcite display different levels of  granularity \" .",
    "for example , bscco - ag tapes consist in filaments made from superconducting grains that are very well connected along the wide face of the tape , embedded in a non - superconducting matrix . for those",
    ", there is a large  in - plane \" anisotropy between the longitudinal and transverse directions of the tape ( x and z axis in figure [ fig : circuit ] ) @xcite in addition to the better known anisotropy between the properties along the x - z plane , and those along the y - axis ( figure [ fig : circuit ] ) .",
    "the anisotropy between the longitudinal and transverse directions of a multi - filamentary superconducting composite is relevant to the ac losses @xcite and influences the availability of  lateral escape ways \" to the current in the presence of transverse cracks @xcite , which has been rarely reported in the literature @xcite .        in this paper",
    ", we study in detail the  in - plane \" anisotropy of bscco - ag tapes .",
    "first , we demonstrate that the transition to the dissipative regime is wider along the transverse direction that along the longitudinal one .",
    "in addition , using an anisotropy parameter defined ad - hoc , we show that the dissipation along the longitudinal direction of the tape approaches that along the transverse direction ( both lying on the wide face of the tape ) as the temperature and the applied current increase .",
    "this transition from high to low in - plane anisotropy is potentially relevant to understand the behavior of superconducting tapes in the high dissipation regime , where transverse cracks and other defects may play an important role .",
    "we use experimental raw data published in a previous paper by our group @xcite as well as some extra data obtained under similar experimental conditions , briefly described here .",
    "samples were prepared from a silver - sheathed 61-filament @xmath2 tape ( bscco - ag ) , measuring @xmath3  mm in width and @xmath4  mm in thickness .",
    "the overall critical ( engineering ) current of the tape was @xmath5  a at liquid nitrogen temperature .",
    "narrow bridges with @xmath6  mm of width were cut from the tape using a laser technique which has been shown not to affect the superconducting properties of the tape @xcite .",
    "current - voltage curves were measured using four probes .",
    "the current contacts were attached outside the narrow bridges and far from the voltage contacts , i.e. , on the wider areas shown in figures [ fig : circuit](b ) and [ fig : circuit](c ) , to guarantee that possible current contact heating had minimal effect on the voltage measurements .",
    "two important parameters characterizing the quality of superconducting tapes are the critical current @xmath7 and the @xmath8-index associated to the @xmath9 curves . it is well known @xcite that the transition to the dissipative regime of multifilamentary superconductors can be described by a power law with exponent @xmath8 given by : @xmath10 where @xmath7 is the critical current defined by a given electric field criterion @xmath11 .",
    "the criterion of electric field used here was @xmath12 @xmath13v @xmath14 .",
    "though some authors use a smaller threshold to determine @xmath7 ( for example @xmath15 @xmath13v @xmath14 ) , our choice has shown to be suitable for @xmath16 superconducting tapes and in small dimensions samples @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : elong ] it is shown the @xmath17 dependence for a longitudinal bridge ( see figure [ fig : circuit](b ) ) for different values of temperature and a separation of @xmath18  mm between voltage contacts .",
    "the linear behavior of the curves can be described by ( [ powerlaw ] ) .",
    "if we fit ( [ powerlaw ] ) to the @xmath19 curves , using @xmath7 and @xmath8 as fitting parameters , we obtain their dependency with temperature which are shown in figure [ fig : ic - ntrans ] as black squares .",
    "curves in the longitudinal direction obtained with a separation of 2.92 mm between voltage contacts .",
    "the gray lines follow ( [ powerlaw ] ) .",
    ", width=307,height=230 ]     curves in the transverse direction after subtracting the lineal behavior to the experimental data .",
    "the results were obtained with a separation of 2.61 mm between voltage contacts .",
    "the curves , from right to left , were obtained from @xmath20 to @xmath21  k , in steps of @xmath22  k. the gray lines follow ( [ powerlaw]).,width=307,height=230 ]    in the transverse direction we can not obtain directly the values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 from the experimental data , as we did in the longitudinal one .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the transverse direction there is always dissipation owing to the presence of inter - filament silver in the way of the current @xcite . as a consequence , ( [ powerlaw ] )",
    "is not directly applicable to the experimental data because , even at low applied currents , the @xmath19 curves have a slope , in contrast with the longitudinal direction , where for currents smaller than @xmath7 , @xmath23 is negligible @xcite .",
    "furthermore , throughout the temperature range studied , there is an interval of currents where the slope of the @xmath19 curves is almost constant .",
    "the procedure we followed was to fit to the experimental data , in the region where the @xmath19 dependence is nearly linear , the equation : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the value of the current where the electric field criterion , @xmath26 @xmath27v @xmath28 , is reached .",
    "so , @xmath25 is the critical current in the transverse direction of the superconductor - silver composite , which is very small due to the fact that in this direction there is always dissipation . after fitting equation ( [ powerlawcomp ] ) to the  linear region \" of the @xmath19 curves",
    ", it was subtracted from the experimental data .",
    "figure [ fig : etran ] shows the experimental data after subtracting the linear region .",
    "these curves exhibit essentially the same behavior of the ones in the longitudinal direction , i.e. for all temperature values there is an interval of currents where the slope of the @xmath19 curves is null ( not shown in the graph ) and a region where the dependency @xmath17 is linear .",
    "therefore , it is safe to assume that , by subtracting the linear behavior to the @xmath19 curves in the transverse direction , the extra dissipation has been eliminated .     with temperature corresponding to different positions of voltage contacts along the transverse bridge .",
    "on top there is a diagram showing the positions where contacts were put.,width=316,height=278 ]    the same procedure was applied to @xmath19 curves obtained for voltage contacts at different positions along the bridge .",
    "figure [ fig : npindex ] shows the dependence of the @xmath29 coefficient with temperature obtained through the fitting of ( [ powerlawcomp ] ) to different positions of voltage contacts along the transverse bridge ( on top of figure [ fig : npindex ] the positions where contacts were put are shown ) .",
    "notice that if the @xmath19 dependence is really linear , the @xmath29 coefficient is equal to @xmath30 . in figure [ fig : npindex ] we can see that @xmath31 for some contact positions but in other positions @xmath32 . the fact that the @xmath29 coefficient is greater than @xmath30 can be associated to the current percolation through the filaments , which we assume responsible of the loss of linear behavior in the @xmath19 curves .",
    "this effect is more pronounced for the largest separations between voltage contacts , where current has the chance of describing more complex trajectories .",
    "the @xmath33 dependencies were also obtained . in figure",
    "[ fig : ic - ntrans](a ) it is shown with empty squares , when the voltage contacts are at the ends of the bridge . only this configuration is shown to make the figure clearer because for the other contact distances the results are practically the same .",
    "we can see , as we said before , that the values of @xmath25 are almost zero .",
    "after subtracting the extra dissipation component to the @xmath19 curves , we fit ( [ powerlaw ] ) to the resulting curves .",
    "the fittings were done in the same manner as in the longitudinal direction , using an electric field criterion of @xmath12 @xmath13v @xmath14 .",
    "this way , the @xmath34 and @xmath35 dependencies were obtained in the transverse direction .",
    "these results are shown in figure [ fig : ic - ntrans ] .",
    "notice that the values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 obtained for separations between contacts less than @xmath30  mm were not shown .",
    "this is due to the fact that the noise in the electric field rises when the voltage contacts get closer , which makes impossible to fit ( [ powerlaw ] ) in the interval of electric fields we are studying .",
    "figure [ fig : ic - ntrans ] also shows , with black squares , the dependencies of @xmath7 and @xmath8 obtained in the longitudinal direction . in the transverse direction , both @xmath7 and @xmath8 decrease by increasing temperature as in the longitudinal direction but their magnitudes are smaller .    due to the fact that the a - b planes of the filaments lie on the wide face of the tape",
    ", one might expect small anisotropy in the transport properties between the longitudinal and transverse directions .",
    "nevertheless , in figure [ fig : ic - ntrans](a ) we can see that the critical currents along both directions are different",
    ". notice , however , that the magnitude that must be similar is the critical current density @xmath36 , because @xmath7 depends on the superconducting area perpendicular to the direction in which current flows .",
    "this area , even though it can be considered as constant in the longitudinal direction , is highly variable in the transverse one ; that is why we are not able to obtain @xmath36 in this direction using only the experimental data .",
    "however , by means of a model already developed by us @xcite we have estimated @xmath36 , which turns out to be very similar in both directions .",
    "the dependency with temperature of @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the longitudinal direction is shown with black squares .",
    "the empty squares shows the values of @xmath25 and @xmath29 obtained through the fitting of ( [ powerlawcomp ] ) to the  linear \" region of the @xmath19 curves in the transverse direction .",
    "the other curves correspond to the values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the transverse direction to different positions of the voltage contacts.,width=297,height=460 ]    figure [ fig : ic - ntrans](b ) shows that the @xmath8-index is smaller in the transverse direction than in the longitudinal one .",
    "the @xmath8-index is inversely related to the width of the @xmath37 transition .",
    "so , even though the critical current densities are similar in both directions , the way in which the filaments pass to the mixed state is different in the two directions .",
    "this can be understood if we assume that the superconductor is made up of a series of  regions \" which critical currents are not necessarily similar .",
    "then , the potential drop experimentally measured is the result of the sum of the potential drops of each one of these regions , thus determining the shape of the @xmath19 curves .",
    "so , it is reasonable to assume that a smaller dispersion of the critical current values gives as a result  steeper \" @xmath19 curves , whose corresponds to a high value of the @xmath8-index . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath19 curves are less  steep \" if there is a greater dispersion of the critical current values , which corresponds to a smaller @xmath8-index .",
    "therefore , taking into account the experimental results shown in figure [ fig : ic - ntrans](b ) , it can be concluded that critical currents along the longitudinal direction are more homogeneous than along the transverse direction .",
    "as we said before , when one speaks about anisotropy in the field of high temperature superconductors , it is typically associated with the anisotropy between the a - b planes and the c axis .",
    "however , we are dealing here with the  in -plane \" anisotropy between the longitudinal and transverse directions relative to the main axis of the tape , which is more connected with the morphology of the superconductor - silver composite than with the  intrinsic \" anisotropy of the superconducting filaments themselves ( whose a - b planes lie parallel to the wide face of the tapes ) .",
    "this anisotropy is of interest in the presence of cracks orthogonal to the direction of the filaments , which interfere with longitudinal current flow over large areas @xcite .",
    "based on the @xmath19 curves , we can quantify it as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the electric fields for the longitudinal and transverse directions respectively . then , if there is  perfect superconductivity \" in the longitudinal direction , @xmath41 . on the other hand , when the dissipation in the longitudinal and transverse directions are equal , @xmath42 .        the upper panel in figure [ fig : anis ] shows the experimental dependence of @xmath43 as a function of the applied current for different temperatures ( open circles ) . in the intermediate and bottom panels of figure [ fig : anis ] , the dependence of @xmath43 with the applied current and the electric field in the longitudinal direction",
    "are shown .",
    "notice that , as @xmath43 decreases , the dissipation along the main direction of the tape increases relative to the dissipation of the transverse one .",
    "following our data , by increasing the temperature , the applied current or the electric field , we see that the contribution of the transverse currents eventually is as relevant as the contribution of the longitudinal ones .",
    "all in all , our results show that the degree of anisotropy at different temperatures and currents is given by the specific geometry and morphology of the composite , and can be ultimately understood by means of percolation simulations , which are in progress .",
    "value of @xmath44 .",
    "( b ) electric field - temperature plane .",
    "the triangles show the dependence of the electric field with temperature for @xmath45 .",
    "the dotted line shows the value @xmath12 @xmath13v @xmath14 . in both figures , in the region where @xmath46 the longitudinal direction is much less dissipative than the transverse one .",
    ", width=268 ]    a useful tool to characterize the tape are the phase diagrams shown in figure [ fig : phasdiag ] .",
    "the diagram shown in figure [ fig : phasdiag](a ) was constructed with the help of the upper panel of figure [ fig : anis ] . to do this , an @xmath43 criterion of 0.95",
    "was selected and the dependence of the current with temperature for this criterion was obtained ( black triangles ) .",
    "this means that the triangles split the region with @xmath46 from the region with @xmath47 in the current - temperature plane ( notice that @xmath45 is equivalent to @xmath48 ) .",
    "thus , for current and temperature values that belong to the region in which @xmath46 , the longitudinal direction is much less dissipative than the transverse one ( the electric field is , at least , @xmath49 times bigger in the transverse direction than in the longitudinal direction ) .",
    "nevertheless , in the region where @xmath47 , dissipation in both directions starts to be comparable .    the squares in figure [ fig : phasdiag](a ) show the dependence of the critical current with temperature in the longitudinal direction .",
    "thus , under the curve delimited by the squares , @xmath41 , because the dissipation in the longitudinal direction is zero , while the transverse direction is always dissipative .",
    "notice that there is a region bounded by square and triangle symbols in which dissipation in the transverse direction is still much higher than dissipation in the longitudinal one .",
    "figure [ fig : phasdiag](b ) shows a diagram similar to the one already shown in figure [ fig : phasdiag](a ) . in this case",
    "was used the bottom panel of figure [ fig : anis ] and using a criterion of @xmath44 the dependence of the electric field with temperature for this criterion was obtained .",
    "this dependence is shown with black triangles .",
    "therefore , below the region delimited by the triangles , the longitudinal direction is much less dissipative than the transverse one . the dotted line in figure [ fig : phasdiag](b ) correspond to @xmath26 @xmath27v @xmath28 .",
    "so , when temperature decreases , the tape is able to work in a wider range of electric fields without  transverse escapes \" of the transport current .",
    "decrease , which means that the transverse direction is able to stand a higher current relative to the longitudinal one .",
    ", width=307,height=220 ]",
    "the critical current and @xmath8-index in the longitudinal and transverse directions of @xmath1 multifilamentary tapes were investigated .",
    "the transition to the dissipative regime is wider in the transverse direction than in the longitudinal one , which is associated to a more inhomogeneous morphology along the former one .",
    "we have quantified the anisotropy of the tapes between their longitudinal and transverse directions through the @xmath43 coefficient a parameter of relevance if transverse cracks force the current to detour from the main direction of the tape .",
    "this coefficient shows a non trivial relation with the temperature , the applied current and the electric field which we represent in the diagram displayed in figure [ fig : alt3d ] : as current and temperature increase , @xmath43 decrease , which means that transport currents are more likely to circulate in the transverse direction .",
