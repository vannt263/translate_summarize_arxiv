    "over the last few years , numerical simulations of chiral fermions have matured .",
    "the stage of testing has passed for simulating valence chiral fermions , and physically relevant results have been reported in lattice simulations .",
    "all the studies so far have concentrated on simulating light quarks .",
    "this is natural , as chiral symmetry plays an important role for small quark masses .",
    "however , the use of overlap fermions to simulate heavy as well as light quarks has been suggested in  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we want to make the point that overlap fermions can also alleviate some problems related to simulating heavy quarks . here",
    "we present the first quantitative study of a heavy quark system using overlap fermions .",
    "this opens the door for the simulation of experimentally more interesting heavy  light systems . using the unequal mass gell - mann - oakes - renner relation as the renormalization condition , the renormalization factor in the heavy - light current can be determined non - perturbatively to a high precision for overlap fermions .",
    "@xcite this is important for computation of heavy - light decay constants .",
    "we demonstrate the value of overlap fermions to simulate heavy quarks using hyperfine splitting in the charmonium system .",
    "it is known that with staggered quarks , there is an ambiguity about nambu - goldstone ( ng ) and non - ng modes for the @xmath4 , resulting in widely different estimates of hyperfine splitting ",
    "51(6 )  mev ( non - ng ) and 404(4 )  mev ( ng )  @xcite .",
    "nrqcd converges only slowly for charm  @xcite .",
    "including @xmath5 terms changed the result from 96(2 )  mev to 55(5 )  mev .",
    "wilson fermions have @xmath6 errors .",
    "hyperfine splitting is very sensitive to the coefficient of the correction term , @xmath7 .",
    "there are many studies @xcite using wilson type valence quarks , including some with non - perturbative @xmath7 , and with continuum extrapolation .",
    "the quenched clover estimate of hyperfine splitting has stabilized around 7075 mev using @xmath2 scale  @xcite , and a higher number of about 85 mev using ( @xmath3 ) scale  @xcite .",
    "results from a 2 + 1 dynamical simulation using tree - level @xmath7 still fall short of the experimental value by about 20%  @xcite .    although costly to simulate , overlap fermions  @xcite have the following desirable features :    * exact chiral symmetry on the lattice . * no additive quark mass renormalization . * no flavor symmetry breaking . * no @xmath6 error . *",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath9 errors are also small , from dispersion relation and renormalization constants .",
    "the first two features are especially significant for light quarks .",
    "many exciting results at low quark masses have been reported using overlap fermions  @xcite .",
    "the last three features are more important for computing charmonium hyperfine splitting using overlap fermions .",
    "the last feature , demonstrated in  @xcite , is an unexpected bonus in this regard .",
    "the key observation is that the discretization errors are only about 5% all the way up to @xmath10 . in fig .",
    "[ fig - disp - shaojing ] we reproduce a plot of the speed of light , obtained from the pseudoscalar meson dispersion relation , as a function of @xmath11 from ref .",
    "this is obtained using a @xmath12 lattice at a spacing of 0.20  fm .",
    "it is harder to study the dispersion relation on the configurations we use for this paper , because on the small volume lattice box we use , one unit of momentum corresponds to about 1.6 gev .",
    "this is a huge amount of momentum , and as a result , the data is noisier .",
    "the effective energies for 0,1 and 2 units of lattice momentum are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - eff - disp ] .",
    "there is no clean plateau already for 2 units of momentum .",
    "this results in a large error bar for the energy corresponding to that momentum .",
    "[ fig - eff - disp ] corresponds to @xmath13 . for smaller values of @xmath11 ,",
    "the data is even more noisy , and it is hard to obtain the speed of light reliably for smaller masses .",
    "however , it is expected that the deviation of speed of light from 1 is larger for higher values of @xmath11 . fig .  [ fig - disp - charm ]",
    "shows percent deviation of the speed of light from unity , obtained from a fit to the dispersion relation as a function of quark mass using the equation @xmath14 it is clear from this figure that we have discretization errors under control at about the 57% level near the charm mass , which is near @xmath15 .",
    ", obtained from the dispersion relation .",
    "it can be seen that the discretization errors are only a few percent till @xmath10 .",

    "the effective energy for 2 units of momentum is very noisy , as explained in text .",
    "[ fig - eff - disp],width=453 ]    .",
    "this serves as an estimate of the percent discretization error . near our charm mass ,",
    "the discretization errors are about 5% .",

    "our simulations are performed on @xmath0 isotropic lattices .",

    "the wilson gauge action is used at @xmath17 = 6.3345 .",
    "we use a multi - mass inverter to obtain propagators for 26 masses ranging from 0.0200.85 in lattice units .",
    "only five of these masses in the range 0.250.50 are used for this study .    since overlap simulations are computationally expensive , it is important to choose the required residues carefully  blindly requiring extremely precise inversions is not the optimal use of computing resources . for overlap simulations , there are three relevant numbers : residue for eigenvectors projected out to reduce the condition number of the matrix to be inverted in the inner loop , residue for inner loop which computes the overlap operator , and residue for the outer loop which actually computes the quark propagators . for the lattices we use ,",
    "we only need to project out about 15 eigenvectors , so we simply demand a very small residue , @xmath18 for this step . unlike this step , however , the inner and outer loop residues demanded affect the computational cost substantially . to determine what residue is good enough , we repeat quark propagator inversion for one spin , one color and one configuration , and compare the `` pseudoscalar '' two - point function for various quark masses .",
    "this is not a physical quantity since no trace over spin and color is performed , and no configuration average is taken  we are simply studying precision issues here . comparing results for inner loop residue of @xmath19 with those from inner loop residue of @xmath20",
    ", we find no change for small quark masses .",
    "however for heavy quarks , the two - point function falls through many orders of magnitude , and becomes very small at the center of the lattice . to get this precisely , we find we need a small inner loop residue ",
    "@xmath19 is not sufficient . in fig .",
    "[ fig - inner ] we show the effect of inner loop residue on `` pseudoscalar '' propagators for heavy quarks .",
    "the curves are slightly shifted for clarity . for @xmath21 ,",
    "even an inner loop residue of @xmath19 appears to be good enough .",
    "however , for a larger @xmath22 , this residue is not good enough for @xmath2330 . for our production runs ,",
    "we choose an inner loop residue of @xmath24 and outer loop residue of @xmath25 .",
    "we have tested outer loop residue of @xmath20 , two orders of magnitude better .",
    "this affects results at less than half percent level , so we deem outer loop residue of @xmath25 to be sufficient .",
    "this residue of @xmath25 is demanded for the lightest quark mass . near the charm mass ,",
    "the residue obtained through the multi - mass inversion algorithm is @xmath26 .",

    "in this paper , we study five charmonium states shown in table  [ table - charm - states ]  @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . for the @xmath32 states ,",
    "there are two possible operators  one ( denoted by @xmath33 ) simply using appropriate @xmath34 matrices and the other ( denoted by @xmath35 ) using a derivative as well as @xmath34 matrices .",
    "we always use a @xmath33 operator for the source , because using a @xmath35 operator for source would require additional inversions .",

    "2 .   statistical error on @xmath38 : in the ( @xmath3 ) scale , this is primarily due to the error on @xmath39 mass , which is about 53 mev .",
    "this is about 12% of the physical ( @xmath3 ) mass difference of 458 mev .",
    "note , this error is absent when the scale is set using @xmath2 . on the other hand , @xmath2 is a model dependent scale , and it can have comparable errors .",
    "it has been pointed out that 0.45  fm may be a better value to use for @xmath2 than 0.50  fm @xcite .",
    "using this value brings our @xmath2 results closer to the ( @xmath3 ) results .",
    "discretization errors : as explained in section 1 , this is estimated at about 5% , from the dispersion relation .",
    "finite volume errors : our simulations are performed on a box size of only 0.8  fm , hence it is not inconceivable that the @xmath32 states have some finite volume errors .",
    "however , even this small box should be large enough for the @xmath40 state particles @xmath41 @xmath42 and @xmath4 .",
    "5 .   quenched approximation : dynamical fermions are expected to increase the value of hyperfine splitting .",
    "this increase is about 20 mev for the wilson - type fermions  @xcite . on the other hand , a study with nrqcd  @xcite",
    "does not find significant contribution due to dynamical fermions .",
    "exclusion of ozi - suppressed diagrams : while a contribution of about 20 mev can not be ruled out , the contribution due to these appears to be small in the charm quark region  @xcite .",
    "lattice calculations with smaller statistical and systematic errors are needed to settle this issue .",
    "we have presented the first study of the charmonium spectrum using overlap fermions . we get a better agreement with the experimental spectrum using @xmath3 scale rather than the @xmath2 scale .",
    "our value for hyperfine splitting is 121(6 )  mev and 88(4 )  mev using @xmath3 and @xmath2 scale respectively .",
    "this is considerably higher than the quenched clover results .",
    "this conclusion can not be escaped even if it is argued that our @xmath32 state results are affected by finite volume errors .",
    "unquenched overlap results with more statistics and somewhat larger box size may very well settle the charmonium hyperfine splitting issue .",
