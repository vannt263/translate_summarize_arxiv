    "statistical physics furnishes diverse tools for the study of human social dynamics . despite the apparent dissimilarities between social and physical systems , many social processes present a phenomenology that resembles that found , for instance , in the physics of frustrated or disordered materials  @xcite",
    "this is because , despite the high heterogeneity of the individuals , and their interactions , not all details are relevant for the emergence of collective patterns .",
    "collective behaviors make social systems interesting for the physicist and , reciprocally , the physicist might contribute with a new perspective to the comprehension of social phenomena .",
    "one of the basic ingredients to be taken into account for modeling people s interactions is imitation , or social contagion .",
    "in fact , imitation is observed in diverse social contexts , such as in the dynamics of language learning or decision making .",
    "the recurrent conformity to the attitudes , opinions or decisions of other individuals , or groups of individuals , has led to the formulation of models based on social contagion as the primary rule of opinion dynamics , e.g. , the voter  @xcite , sznajd  @xcite and majority rule  @xcite models , to give just a few examples .",
    "however , aside from imitation , individuals also dissent and resist to be influenced , in several ways .    in the present work , we study the effect of nonconformity attitudes through a kinetic exchange model  @xcite . within this modeling ,",
    "the influences that an individual exerts over another are modulated by a coupling strength .",
    "the coupling strength between connected individuals typically takes positive values but also , with certain probability , it can adopt negative ones .",
    "negative values represent negative influences that , instead of imitation , promote dissent .",
    "notice that this kind of dissent is not a characteristic of the individual but of the tie ( or link ) between each pair of individuals .",
    "there are also other types of nonconformity , which are not associated to the links but to the individuals ( or nodes in the network of contacts ) , as taken into account in several models  @xcite .",
    "one of these types is anticonformity  @xcite .",
    "an anticonformist actively dissents from other people s opinions , which is the case contemplated , for example , by galam s contrarians  @xcite . actually , although these anticonformists defy other people s opinions or the group norm , they are similar to conformists in the sense that they take into account other s opinions too .",
    "a different kind of nonconformity is independence , such that the individual tends to resist the influences of other agents or groups of agents , ignoring their choices in the adoption process .",
    "it can be thought either as an attribute of the agent , that acts as independent with certain probability , or an attitude that any individual can assume with certain frequency .",
    "it is in the latter sense that we will incorporate independence into the model .",
    "another important ingredient for modeling opinion dynamics is conviction or persuasion ( a kind of stubbornness or resistance to change mind )  @xcite .",
    "we will consider the heterogeneity of the individuals in that respect .",
    "each agent will be characterized by a parameter that measures its level of conviction about the opinion it supports .",
    "this parameter , typically defined positive , will be allowed to take also negative values to represent volatile individuals that change mind easily .",
    "heterogeneities and disorder can act on opinion dynamics as stochastic drivings able to promote a phase transition , playing the role of a source of randomness or noise similar to a social temperature  @xcite .",
    "we will focus on the impact of all the abovementioned sources of disorder on the steady state distribution of opinions in the population , and investigate the occurrence of nonequilibrium phase transitions .",
    "our model belongs to the class of kinetic exchange opinions models  @xcite .",
    "we consider a fully - connected population of size @xmath1 participating in a public debate .",
    "each agent @xmath2 in this artificial society has an opinion @xmath3 .",
    "most models of opinion dynamics deal with a discrete state space  @xcite , which may be enough to tackle certain problems that involve binary or several particular choices .",
    "however , to investigate , for instance , the emergence of extreme opinions , it seems to be more suitable to represent opinions by means of a continuous variable , to reflect the possible shades of peoples attitudes about a given subject  @xcite .",
    "then , we will consider a continuous state space , where opinions can take values in the real range @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "positive ( negative ) values indicate that the position is favorable ( unfavorable ) to the topic under discussion .",
    "opinions tending to @xmath4 and @xmath5 indicate extremist individuals .",
    "finally , opinions near @xmath6 mean neutral or undecided agents .    at a given step @xmath7 , the following microscopic rules control the opinion dynamics :    1 .",
    "we choose two random agents @xmath2 and @xmath8 .",
    "2 .   with probability @xmath9 ,",
    "the agent @xmath2 acts as independent . in this case",
    ", the agent chooses a position about the subject under discussion , i.e. , @xmath10 is randomly selected from a uniform distribution @xmath0 $ ] , independently of the current states @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "that is , as commented above , we consider that independence is not an attribute of the individual but an attitude that any individual can occasionally assume with certain probability . in that opportunity",
    ", individuals choose their own position ( state ) independently of the other individuals  @xcite .",
    "3 .   otherwise , with probability @xmath13 , the agent @xmath2 acts as a partially conformist individual , and will be influenced by agent @xmath8 by means of a kinetic exchange . in this case , the opinion of agent @xmath2 will be updated according to the rule @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are real parameters that measure the level of conviction of agent @xmath2 , and the strength of the influence that agent @xmath2 suffers from agent @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the opinions are restricted to the range @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "therefore , whenever eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) yields @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , it will , actually , lead the opinion to the extreme @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , as considered in refs .  @xcite .",
    "this re - injection of the opinions into the interval @xmath0 $ ] introduces a nonlinearity in the mapping given by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , that becomes linear by parts . smoothing this nonlinearity , for instance through",
    "@xmath21 $ ] , is not expected to affect the results significantly , as will be discussed below in connection with the outcomes of simulations .",
    "+ typically , the strength @xmath16 is positive , meaning agreement , but it can also take negative values to represent ties that induce dissent .",
    "the fraction of negative influences is given by a parameter @xmath22 , such that @xmath16 is uniformly distributed either in @xmath23 $ ] or in @xmath24 $ ] , with probabilities @xmath22 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "+ parameter @xmath15 is also typically positive , representing the weight or contribution that the current opinion of agent @xmath2 has , with respect to that of other agents , in the opinion formation process .",
    "the larger @xmath15 , the less other individuals contribute to mold the opinion of agent @xmath2 .",
    "sufficiently large values of @xmath15 ( larger than 1 for the current choice of the set @xmath16 ) mimic intransigence or stubbornness , such that the opinion of agent @xmath2 will not evolve .",
    "parameter @xmath15 can also take negative values , to represent volatile individuals that are not persistent in their positions , that is , have a propensity to change mind .",
    "this spontaneous change must be distinguished from the change of opinion in independent behavior described above .",
    "due to the minus sign , an agent with negative conviction will always change side , adopting a new opinion which is the opposite of the previous one .",
    "differently , in the independent case , since the new opinion is chosen at random , the individual opinion will not necessarily change sign but can take any value in the spectrum .",
    "+ the fraction of negative convictions will be controlled by a parameter @xmath26 , such that @xmath27 is uniformly distributed either in @xmath23 $ ] or in @xmath24 $ ] , with probabilities @xmath26 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the unit of time is defined by the application of the above - mentioned steps @xmath1 times . concerning the random nature of the convictions @xmath15 and the couplings @xmath16 , which are assumed to be uncorrelated , we consider quenched ( frozen ) variables , as far as opinion formation supposedly occurs in a time scale much faster than the changes in agents attributes and couplings",
    ".    we will consider populations of @xmath1 fully - connected individuals , situation which corresponds to a mean - field limit .",
    "the initial state of the system is assumed to be fully disordered , that is , at the beginning of the dynamics , each individual has an opinion drawn from the uniform distribution in the range @xmath0 $ ] .    in the following",
    ", we will describe separately two distinct cases characterized by : ( i ) the existence of competitive positive / negative interactions among pairs of agents , while convictions are homogeneous ( with @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) , and ( ii ) the heterogeneity of agents convictions , which interactions are always positive ( @xmath31 , for all @xmath32 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the noise introduced by independent attitudes is included .",
    "we calculate the parameter @xmath33 given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes average over disorder or configurations , computed at the steady states .",
    "notice that @xmath33 is a kind of order parameter that plays the role of the `` magnetization per spin '' in magnetic systems .",
    "it is sensitive to the unbalance between positive and negative opinions .",
    "a state with a large value of @xmath33 ( @xmath36 ) means that an extremist position reached consensus .",
    "intermediate values indicate : ( i ) the dominance of either one of the extreme opinions , ( ii ) that opinions are moderate but one of the sides wins , or ( iii ) a combination of both .",
    "all these states can be identified with ordered ones in the sense that the debate has a clear result ( favorable or unfavorable ) , be extremist or moderate .",
    "a small value ( @xmath37 ) indicates a symmetric distribution of opinions : ( i ) polarization such that opposite opinions balance , ( ii ) the dominance of very moderate or undecided opinions around the neutral state , or ( iii ) a combination of both . in all symmetric cases ,",
    "the debate will not have a clear winner position . in that sense",
    "the collective state can be identified with a disordered one .",
    "we consider also the fluctuations @xmath38 ( or `` susceptibility '' ) of parameter @xmath33 , @xmath39 and the binder cumulant @xmath40  @xcite , defined as @xmath41    all these quantities will be used to characterize the phase transitions between ordered and disordered phases .",
    "additionally , those phases will be described by means of the pattern that the distribution of opinions presents .",
    "let us focus first on the effect of competitive interactions ( with a fraction @xmath22 of negative couplings ) and independence ( which occurs with probability @xmath42 ) , by studying the case of homogeneous agents with @xmath29 for all @xmath2 .",
    "in figure  [ fig1 ] we exhibit @xmath33 as a function of the independence parameter @xmath9 , for different values of @xmath22 .",
    "as observed in the figure , independence makes the system undergo a phase transition , an effect which is typical of social temperatures  @xcite .     versus the independence probability @xmath9 , for several values of the fraction @xmath22 of negative interaction strengths , with @xmath29 for all @xmath2 .",
    "one can observe transitions at different critical points @xmath43 , but the maximal value of @xmath33 decreases with @xmath22 and the transition is eliminated for sufficiently large values of @xmath22 .",
    "the population size is @xmath44 and data are averaged over @xmath45 simulations.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    the transition occurs even when couplings are all positive ( @xmath46 ) , then the mere presence of independence leads the system to undergo a phase transition .",
    "a similar effect was observed in the discrete version of the present model , considering only opinions @xmath47 , @xmath6 , @xmath4 , although the critical point @xmath48 has a different value ( 1/4 in the discrete case  @xcite ) .",
    "when we introduce negative interaction strengths ( @xmath49 ) , states characterized by @xmath50 , meaning consensus of extreme opinions , become unlikely ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the critical values @xmath51 decrease with @xmath22 and , above sufficiently large @xmath22 , the system becomes disordered for any @xmath9 .",

    "[ case1 ] , where the convictions are given by @xmath29 for all @xmath2 , but there is a probability @xmath49 of negative couplings , patterns of opinions like those shown in figure  [ fig4 ] occur .",
    "qualitatively similar patterns arise when the pairwise interactions are @xmath71 for all @xmath32 but convictions are random . in the disordered phase , opinions are evenly distributed . in the ordered ones , extremists dominate .",
    "the steady states show the presence of a large number of extremists with opinions either @xmath83 or @xmath47 .",
    "the fraction of these extremists decreases for increasing values of the independence parameter @xmath9 , and the system tends to become disordered , indicating that independent attitudes reduce extreme opinions .",
    "different patterns emerge when there are two sources of heterogeneity , with negative values or not , like in the case of sec .",
    "[ case2 ] , where the couplings and the convictions are random . in the disordered phase , opinions are not evenly distributed , but moderate opinions dominate , with a peak around the neutral state . in the ordered phases , one of the opinion sides disappears .",
    "when a second source of heterogeneity is present , the increase of volatile individuals ( increasing @xmath26 ) or of dissent interactions ( positive @xmath22 ) , reduces , even extinguishes , the fraction of extremists and also prevents the arrival to consensus .",
    "the models considered in this work contribute to the analysis of the role of the diverse features that characterize individuals and their interactions . as can be seen in this paper ,",
    "each modification yields phase diagrams of order parameters that seem similar , however a quite different phenomenology arises in terms of the distribution of opinions .",
    "this hinders unification , justifying a separate analysis of different versions of the model .",
    "these versions shed light on the origin and role of undecided individuals and extremism uprise , and the effect of realistic characteristics like conviction and independence in the dynamics of opinion formation and evolution .",
    "in particular , the models contribute to understand the circumstances which favor the emergence and development of extremism in a fraction of the population , relating that emergence with the existence of individuals with strong positive convictions in the population . on the other hand , the presence of negative convictions , that represent volatile individuals that have a propensity to change mind , as well as nonconformity represented in the model by the independent behavior , lead to the dominance of moderate individuals .",
