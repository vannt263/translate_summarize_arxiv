    "to establish a set of stellar flux standards , one or more stars must be established with known absolute spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "one method for establishing these so - called `` standard candles '' in the sky is to determine the composition , effective temperature , and surface gravity and then compute a model atmosphere sed . the simplest case with the best known atomic physics is for a hot pure hydrogen white dwarf ( wd ) star , where the temperature and gravity are determined from fits of model line profiles to the observed balmer lines ( e.g. , finley , koester , & basri 1997 , barstow et  al .  2003 ) .",

    "following the establishment of the absolute seds for the primary stars , a flux distribution for another star is established by the response relative to the primaries when observed by a linear spectrometer of constant sensitivity . in practice ,",

    "considerable effort has been expended in tracking the stis changes in sensitivity with time ( stys , bohlin , & goudfrooij 2004 and unpublished updates ) and in correcting the ccd observations for loss of charge transfer efficiency ( cte ; goudfooij & bohlin 2006 ) . in the 0.82.5",

    "the switch to nlte models with the same @xmath13 and @xmath14 values could cause a systematic error in the _ hst _ flux scale by as much as 2% in the ir and up to 4% in the far - uv .",
    "however , figure  3 demonstrates internal consistency among the three primary standards to @xmath110.5% for stis and to @xmath71% for the nicmos data , so that any changes to the models must be nearly the same function of wavelength for all three stars .",
    "an effort to determine the proper nlte @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the primary standards is underway with d.  finley and i.  hubeny and will be reported separately .",
    "this paper concentrates on a discussion of the transfer of the primary fluxes to the secondary stars .",

    "longward of 1  @xmath5 m , only two observations of each star have been obtained with the nicmos grisms , so that the typical nicmos repeatability of 1% dominates the scatter .",
    "the nicmos observation are dithered over a y - range of 16 pixels in a relatively blemish free region in the lower left quadrant of nic3 ( bohlin , lindler , & riess 2005 ) . due to imperfect flat fields ,",

    "while the interstellar reddening is negligible for the primary standards , the fainter secondary standards suffer from a small amount of reddening , as illustrated in figure  4 for wd1657 + 343 .",
    "the substantially better fit in the far - uv with the lmc reddening curve than with an average galactic reddening is a bit surprising ; but such a tiny local amount of dust could be processed differently than on average in the galaxy . similarly for wd1057 + 719 , the model fits the observed continuum best for an lmc reddening with @xmath16 .",

    ", reddened models define the best estimates of the standard star flux distributions at all wavelengths , except where there are interstellar lines .",
    "the ly@xmath10 and balmer lines of the models can not be compared precisely to the observation , because the stis line - spread function ( lsf ) has wide wings and is not well determined .",
    "bohlin & gilliland ( 2004 , bg ) measured the flux for vega using stis spectra that are heavily saturated , but remarkably linear .",
    "multiple observations repeat to better than 0.5% . however , small adjustments to the stis calibration have changed the derived absolute spectrophotometry by up to 2% at the longest wavelengths , where the improved cte correction of goudfooij & bohlin ( 2006 ) is the dominate reason for revising the bg results . below 7000   ,",

    ", 214 , 1 ( th03 )    the final absolute accuracy of the calibration of nicmos spectra in your presentation was 2 to 3% .",
    "the relative calibration uncertainties for nicmos spectra extracted from different parts of the detector are typically significantly larger than this number due to flat fielding uncertainties , pixel response function , and non - linearities .",
    "to what kind of observations does the absolute calibration apply ?",
    "corrections for the pixel response function due to interpixel gaps effect the extracted four - pixel - high spectra by as much as @xmath155% ( bohlin et  al .",
    "2005 ) ; but errors in this correction are @xmath111% .",
    "i claim to correct for non - linearities to @xmath71% ( bohlin , riess , & de jong 2006 ) .",
    "my sensitivity calibrations for the nicmos grism spectra are for a small region in the lower left hand quadrant of the detector .",
    "figure  3 shows residuals of @xmath111% for the three primary standards for this region of the detector . an early post - cryo - cooler observation of p330e in 2002 by roger thompson is an average of 15 different positions over the entire nic-3 detector .",
    "the whole detector average and my spectrum of p330e are consistent to 2% ; however , flat fielding errors of 3% at any single location on nic3 would not be surprising . a new grism flat field data cube should be obtained .",
    "1 )  although it is possible to fit the continuum of vega over a fair range of wavelengths with the predictions of a single kurucz model , it is not possible to fit the line spectrum without modeling the changes of temperature and gravity from the pole to the equator .",
    "synthetic vega spectra depend on factors such as the difference of the equatorial and polar temperatures , the inclination angle of the rotational axis and the equatorial velocity .",
    "2 )  besides problems due to atomic and molecular data , synthetic spectra of solar like stars longward of the balmer confluence also change with the adopted theory of convection .",
    "what is needed to get better matches is a theory of convection which is based on real physics and physically defined boundaries .",
    "simplified models such as mixing - length theory and its variants are bound to be inadequate .",
    "1 )  the measured continuum flux of vega from 320010000  fits a single temperature kurucz model at 9400  k to 2% and to 1% over most of this region ( see figure  5 ) .",
    "the largest differences occur in the psuedo - continuum from 36504450    in the balmer line confluence , where the exact physics of the hydrogen atom is still problematic .",
    "what saul says is certainly true for the line cores at high spectral resolution ."
