    "the combination of domain - wall fermions and renormalization group ( rg ) improved gauge actions has been proven to yield fermions with good chiral behavior , allowing progress in the calculation of weak matrix elements ( wme ) on the lattice  @xcite . on the other hand , two examples of open issues are the scaling behavior of @xmath1 and the effect of the charm quark which contributes to @xmath2 matrix elements through the quark loop contraction  @xcite .",
    "both of these require the calculation of wme , using fermions with good chiral behavior , on finer lattices than have been employed so far",

    "though the use of the rg - improved dbw2 gauge action improves chiral symmetry , it has been recognized that the topological charge of dbw2 gauge configurations generated by standard monte carlo techniques evolves very slowly  @xcite .",
    "this fact motivated us to implement a strategy to generate gauge configurations whose topological charge is well - distributed @xcite .    in the following ,",

    "the part of the topological charge produced by physical , long distance properties of the wilson lattices should be very close to that of a fully sampled dbw2 ensemble , since at these weak couplings such a physical quantity is independent of the uv details of the action .",
