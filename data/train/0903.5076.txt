    "in a 1d quantum wire the conductance is the integer multiple of @xmath1 because of the quantized state in the transverse direction",

    "when the conductance is close to @xmath1 , the electron density is effectively low . in this regime ,",
    "coulomb interaction could become important , and the single particle model may not describe the physics satisfactorily .",
    "it has been long that an additional conductance shoulder was observed below the first plateau , and is often called `` 0.7 anomaly / structure '' .",
    "the very first attempting explanation referred it to spontaneous spin polarization.@xcite many works have been intrigued since then .",

    "however , the mechanism is not yet fully understood for the time being .",

    "electrons at low densities attempt to occupy equidistantly in order to minimize the coulomb repulsion and form a lattice - like structure , wigner crystal.@xcite it was proposed that an one dimensional wigner crystal can be modeled as an ` _ _ antiferromagnetic _ _ ' spin - chain with coupling strength j.@xcite the lattice vibration and spin interaction can be described by two separate hamiltonians . accordingly",

    "this was later termed asspin - incoherent transport\".@xcite @xmath9 equals @xmath5 in a ` _ _ long _ _ '",
    "tll connected with non - interacting fermi gas .",
    "the value of @xmath9 may depends on the wavelength of plasmons , i.e how strongly plasmons are aware of the interaction inside the wire .",
    "therefore the conductance of an one - dimensional wigner crystal depends on j , t and wire length .",
    "it has been reported that the conductance of a gaas / algaas quantum wire approaches @xmath10 with weakening confinement potentials and it was referred to spin - incoherent transport.@xcite inspired by the aforementioned works , we studied the dependence of the conductance correction on carrier density , temperature and magnetic field in a semiconductor quantum wire .",
    "the results agree with the predictions of spin - incoherent theories and suggest connections with 0.7 structure .",
