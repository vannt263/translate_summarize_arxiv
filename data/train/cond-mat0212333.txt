    "a molecular mixture with a finite number of components with different physical properties like characteristic dimension , mass or charge is a well controlled system in the sense that all these properties are known exactly through the study of each component in its pure state .",
    "also the relative proportion of each component is a parameter that can be controlled in experiments .",
    "the situation is very different in the industrial colloidal systems because during its manufacture process are involved many no controlled factors at microscopic scales . in this case",
    "these physical properties vary in a certain range practically in a continuous way .",
    "then , is more appropriate to treat these system as polydisperse in nature with its properties distributed in some range according to some continuous size distribution function .",
    "although in experiments are known that many systems are polydisperse in nature there is not information about the kind of polydisperse distribution function that follows its physical properties .",
    "example of such systems are colloidal suspensions , polymer blends and emulsions .",
    "a common phenomena that have been observed experimentally in many polydisperse systems is that the coexisting phases have different particles sizes distributions @xcite and the simulations also corroborate these results for hard spheres @xcite . for anisotropic particles experiments",
    "shows that the polydispersity makes the phase diagram much more complex including up to four different coexisting phases @xcite .",
    "recent experiments show that the isotropic phase of polydisperse hard disk system under certain conditions can be more dense than the nematic phase @xcite .    from theoretical point of view",
    "the polydisperse systems composed by anisotropic particles have been in general modeled using a free energy functional for a binary mixture when the polydispersity has a clear bimodal distribution .",
    "the fundamental approach is then the mapping of polydisperse system onto a bidisperse one.these bidisperse systems show similar transitions found in experiments with the organophilic polydisperse rod - like colloidal particles ( boehmite core - particles ) including a three phase isotropic - nematic - nematic region @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the inclusion of bidispersity impose two relevant scales ( the two characteristic lengths of the particles ) that are absent in the unimodal polydisperse systems .",
    "recent works include the polydispersity via a continuous size distribution function @xcite .",
    "this was motivated by the development of the moment theory for polydisperse systems which makes more accessible the theoretical study because the original infinite number of variables that describe the whole system are reduced in this approximation to some moments of the distribution function through a projection to the space extended by them @xcite .",
    "this approximation was applied to the study of melting in polydisperse hard spheres @xcite .",
    "then , any density functional theory which excess part of free energy depends only on a few moments have a natural extension to the polydisperse case .",
    "the fundamental measure theory @xcite is a clear candidate for applying it to these systems .",
    "this functional was used in the study of the local size segregation of hard sphere fluid in a presence of a hard wall @xcite .",
    "although experimentally was obtained the bulk phase diagram for a few polydisperse systems including also the solid phases @xcite there is no so many works about inhomogeneous polydisperse systems where the inhomogeneities are created by external fields such as a hard wall or about the study of interfaces between the coexisting phases ( there is a recent work @xcite about the study of the surface tension and adsorption properties of the planar interface between coexisting fluid phases ) .",
    "recently have been published some works about the study of hard rod monodisperse system in a presence of a hard wall or confined in the slit showing a continuous uniaxial - biaxial nematic transition at density bellow the bulk isotropic - nematic transition followed by the complete wetting by nematic at the wall - isotropic interface @xcite . also was studied in these works the isotropic - nematic interface and the capillary nematization of the slit using the zwanzig model in the onsager approximation to describe the hard rod system .",
    "the simulations @xcite and experiments @xcite confirm in the qualitative level all these results .    in general ,",
    "the calculation of inhomogeneous density profiles for mixtures of hard core anisotropic bodies using density functional theory is a difficult problem for two reasons .",
    "one is the numerical problem caused by the presence of orientational degrees of freedom for each component , besides the spatial one .",
    "this complicates functional minimization .",
    "the second problem is that there are not so well developed and tested density functionals for mixtures as for one - component systems .",
    "fundamental measure functionals ( fmf ) are good candidates because of its natural extension to mixtures from one - component systems @xcite .",
    "but these functionals which are very good at predicting the freezing of a hard spheres @xcite or the inhomogeneous density profiles induced by external fields @xcite have some difficulties if we try to extend them in a classical way to a system of anisotropic particles with continuous rotational degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the main problem here is that the fourier transform of the direct correlation function calculated from the natural extension of the fmf to anisotropic particles is isotropic at @xmath2 , which is unphysical @xcite .",
    "nevertheless there is another way to construct a fundamental measure theory ( fmt ) without using the starting point of the scale particle theory .",
    "this is the cavities method @xcite .",
    "this method refuses to postulate that the functional should depend only on certain weighted densities which are linear convolutions of the density profiles .",
    "the main idea behind it is to ensure the dimensional cross - over of the functional for different configurations of cavities @xcite .",
    "the final result is a functional which depends on a nonlinear kernel that can not be decoupled in a set of one particle weighed densities .",
    "but this functional is impractical when there are rotational degrees of freedom , because the numerical minimization problem turns out to bee extremely hard .",
    "a simplification of the initial problem is to assume that particles are restricted to have a few discrete orientations .",
    "particles with different orientations are treated as different species and then it is completely justified to use the classical version of fmt for mixtures . the easiest way to implement this method is the zwanzig model @xcite , which describes a system of hard parallelepipeds with three mutual perpendicular orientations .",
    "an fmf for parallel hard parallelepipeds which fulfills all dimensional cross - overs @xcite has been applied to the study of the nature of the order of nematic - smectic a transition @xcite .",
    "i will use this functional in the onsager limit to study the continuous polydisperse system . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been presented the general formalism for the study of the bulk phase diagram of the polydisperse zwanzig model in onsager s limit .",
    "the bulk phase diagram was obtained for the particular choice of the schulz size distribution function .",
    "i have two purposes in the study of the polydisperse hard rod system .",
    "the first is that as i have already mentioned the knowledge of the specific type of polydispersity inherent to a particular system is commonly very poor . then is important to study how depends the phase diagram topology on the kind of introduced polydispersity .",
    "after have been obtained as general as possible a characterization of the phase behaviour for different families of polydispersity distribution functions ( i will suppose that all distributions are unimodal ) i will study different interfaces : the wall isotropic , the isotropic - nematic and the nematic polydisperse hard rod system confined between two walls .",
    "an interesting questions are how polydispersity affect the surface phase transitions found in @xcite and to study the novel surface behaviour inherent only to polydisperse systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "is obtained formally the onsager limit of the fundamental measure functional for polydisperse hard parallelepipeds and the proper equations to calculate the bulk phase diagram ( subsection [ bulkphase ] ) and the different interfaces ( subsection [ interface ] ) . in section [ thermo ]",
    "are deduced some general results for thermodynamic of polydisperse interfaces , specifically the extension of the interface gibbs - duhem equation to polydisperse case . in section",
    "[ finite ] are presented some important remarks about the validity of the thermodynamic limit in finite polydisperse systems .",
    "the results are presented in section [ results ] divided in different subsections where i study the possible bulk and surface phase diagrams for rapidly ( subsection [ rapidly ] ) and slowly ( subsection [ slowly ] ) decaying distribution functions .",
    "the last subsections are devoted to the study of different interfaces : wall - isotropic , isotropic - nematic ( subsection [ w - i - n ] ) and a polydisperse nematic liquid crystal in the slit ( subsection [ capillary ] ) . finally the conclusions are summarized in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "suppose we have a multicomponent mixture of uniaxial parallelepipeds , all of them with the same cross section width @xmath3 but different lengths @xmath4 ( @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the number of species ) . the orientation of each parallelepiped is restricted to one of the three perpendicular axis @xmath7 , @xmath8 or @xmath9 as is sketched in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "this is the well known zwanzig model @xcite .",
    "as i want to study planar interfaces i will suppose that the density profiles of different species are inhomogeneous only in one spatial direction and i will label them as follows : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 labels the orientation of the species with length @xmath12 .",
    "the excess part of free energy density according to the fundamental measure theory for this model is @xcite @xmath13 where the @xmath14 s are weighted densities , i.e. linear convolutions of the density profiles with certain weights : @xmath15 where `` @xmath16 '' means the convolution with respect to the spatial variables .",
    "these weights are characteristic functions whose integrals are fundamental measures of the convex particle @xcite",
    ". the nature of the @xmath17 s can be either scalar or vector .",
    "the scalars are @xmath18 where for example @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "these examples allow us to recognize the used notation : the subindex labels the spatial coordinate present in the argument of the dirac delta function .",
    "if the superindex and the subindex coincide then the corresponding parallelepiped edge length in the argument of this function is @xmath12 otherwise is @xmath3 .",
    "the meaning of the labels for @xmath21 is the same as in the preceding case , but @xmath22 now represents hevisaide function @xmath23 .    the vector weighs are    @xmath24    with @xmath25 and @xmath26 the component @xmath27 is obtained from @xmath28 substituting in eq .",

    "the rest of the components can be obtained using the same procedure .    now",
    ", suppose that we select a natural scale @xmath33 for the length of the parallelepipeds , for example the mean length @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 is the molar fraction of the specie @xmath36 ) .",
    "doing the change of variable @xmath37 and @xmath38 and taking the limit @xmath39 ( infinite number of components , so the mixture contains parallelepipeds with lengths distributed with certain continuous function ) we should replace @xmath40 in any of the equations that define the weighted densities , and the density profiles are now functions of @xmath1 and @xmath9 : @xmath41 .",
    "we should remember that @xmath9 is in reduced units .    we know from onsager that the correct variable to describe a nematic phase in the limit of infinite aspect ratio is @xmath42",
    ", so i will use in the following this scaled density for any specie using the same notation : @xmath43 . using the expansions of the convolutions @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) in powers of @xmath3 : @xmath47 respectively ( primes denote derivatives w.r.t .",

    "the species with large lengths have a strong influence in the phase behaviour of the system .",

    "the solution of the set of equations ( [ eq28])-([eq29 ] ) at @xmath123 and the condition @xmath378 is equivalent to find the coexistence between two phases in the two dimensional bulk system of polydisperse hard rods ( @xmath389 and @xmath270 ) with the excess energy density @xmath390 , where @xmath391 is the excess part of the bulk free energy density of the 2d system .",
    "the reason why i have found two coexisting nematics in the bulk phase diagram when @xmath344 only for @xmath299 ( the bulk triple point ) whereas for @xmath392 exists at the wall a whole range of first order n - n transition is the following : the equations ( [ eq28 ] ) and ( [ eq30 ] ) for @xmath123 can be put in the form @xmath393 which form coincide exactly with the set of equations resulting from the equality of chemical potentials between the cloud isotropic and shadow nematic phases for @xmath394 system with the following variable definitions : @xmath395 , @xmath396 , @xmath397 and @xmath398 . then",
    "the surface - parent phase from which separate the different coexisting phases have not a log - normal distribution form .",
    "if the bulk density @xmath95 is large enough then the `` surface - parent '' length distribution function @xmath399 has a second maxima at @xmath400 and with a bimodal parent distribution function is possible to find a nematic - nematic coexistence .    for the non local model",
    "is very difficult to gain insight about the monotonic behaviour of the density profiles as can be seen from the equations ( [ eq60])-([eq60a ] ) . in principle",
    "they can be non monotonic functions of @xmath9 .",
    "then , the location of the transition points between different surface phases through a first order transition may differ from the local model results .",
    "i have solved the equations ( [ eq28])-([eq30 ] ) using the schultz s length distribution function for the bulk isotropic phase to obtain the equilibrium wall - isotropic profiles .",
    "i used the gauss - laguerre quadrature to calculate the integrals over variable @xmath1 using 10 points and using the fast fourier transform algorithm to calculate the convolutions @xmath401 for each @xmath1 with a grid spacing @xmath402 ( @xmath403 is the smallest quadrature point ) .",
    "i have compared the results with those obtained by increasing the number of points used in the quadrature until 20 and the density profiles and the surface tension values does not change appreciably for @xmath404 .    for polydispersity value @xmath405 and bulk isotropic density @xmath406 ( @xmath287 is the density of the isotropic - biaxial nematic transition which is shown as a function of @xmath219 in the inset of figure [ fig17 ] )",
    "i obtain the density profiles @xmath407 , @xmath408 and @xmath409 shown in figure [ fig17 ] . in the upper figure are plotted the order in plane parameter @xmath410 for different values of @xmath95 . when @xmath411 ( @xmath146 as a function of @xmath219 is also plotted in the inset of the upper figure ) the point @xmath412 where separates the @xmath413 and @xmath414 branches go to infinity continuously as should be in the complete wetting transition , with the final profile composed by macroscopic layer of the nematic phase .",
    "i have checked that @xmath415 for @xmath416 ( with @xmath417 , @xmath418 and @xmath419 the wall - isotropic , wall - nematic and nematic - isotropic surface tensions ) which should be fulfilled at the complete wetting transition .",
    "i also have found that @xmath182 and @xmath184 diverges logarithmically with coefficients @xmath420 and @xmath421 depending on @xmath219 as we can see from figure [ fig18 ] .",
    "the general trend is that the prefactor ( @xmath422 ) of the logarithmic divergence of the density adsorption coefficient is a decreasing function ( in absolute value ) of @xmath219 , whereas the prefactor ( @xmath423 ) of the logarithmic divergence of the first moment adsorption coefficient is an increasing function ( in absolute value ) of @xmath219 .",
    "this result is due to the fact that the density gap between the wetting density @xmath424 and the density of the coexisting nematic phase @xmath111 decrease with polydispersity as we can see from figure [ fig19 ] , whereas the moment gap is an increasing function of @xmath219 ( see figure [ fig19 ] ) .",
    "the surface tension as a function of @xmath95 is plotted in figure ( [ fig20 ] ) for three different values of @xmath219 . as i have already shown in section [ thermo ] the behaviour of @xmath425",
    "is governed by certain combination of @xmath182 and @xmath184 ( see equation ( [ eq47 ] ) ) , thus taking into account that these quantities have a logarithmic divergence can be used the approximate analytic equation ( [ eq22 ] ) to estimate the difference between the wall - isotropic surface tension @xmath417 for @xmath426 and its wetting value at @xmath416 .",
    "for comparison i have plotted in figure [ fig20 ] the exact value of @xmath417 and the approximation ( [ eq22 ] ) for @xmath405 .",
    "if we take into the account that the comparison between them should be restricted to the narrow neighborhood of @xmath146 is surprising that they are similar until @xmath427 , and that the maximun position is well estimated .",
    "also is plotted @xmath417 for @xmath428 and @xmath429 .    in figure [ fig21-fig22 ] ( the upper one )",
    "are shown the isotropic - nematic interfaces for @xmath416 and @xmath430 .",
    "in particular are plotted the profiles @xmath431 for three different @xmath1 s .",
    "this ratio should tend to 1 at the bulk isotropic side of the interface . from figure",
    "is clear that the nematic phase has more amount of large rods than the isotropic one .",
    "this effect is more dramatic for higher @xmath219 s . in the bottom figure",
    "i show for fixed @xmath432 the profiles for two different @xmath219 s . by increasing @xmath219 the amount of rods with this length changes its segregation behaviour .",
    "for @xmath433 they are lightly segregated at the isotropic phase whereas for @xmath430 they strongly segregate to the nematic phase .",
    "i have also calculated the wall - isotropic interface in the local approximation using the log - normal length distribution function for the bulk isotropic phase solving the equations ( [ eq28 ] ) , ( [ eq29 ] ) and ( [ eq35 ] ) .",
    "the main reason to use the local approximation is that is impossible to select an effective quadrature to estimate the integral over @xmath1 due to the specific form of the @xmath41 for large @xmath1 s ( which can develop a second maxima ) .",
    "far from the wetting transition in the region of @xmath95 s where the slope of @xmath417 with respect to @xmath95 is practically zero we have calculated the density profiles @xmath434 and @xmath435 for @xmath436 . in figure [ fig23 ]",
    "are given these profiles for @xmath437 .",
    "as we can see from the figure whereas the density adsorption coefficient @xmath182 is negative , the first moment adsorption coefficient @xmath184 is positive . as i have already shown ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq47 ] ) ) the slope of the surface tension depends on certain combination of @xmath182 and @xmath184 . for this particular case",
    "the slope is negative although @xmath438 in contrast with the result obtained using the interface gibbs - duhem equation for one component system .    for some @xmath219 s greater than @xmath439 (",
    "the critical point value for the first order @xmath352 transition at the wall ) were calculated the adsorption coefficients @xmath182 and @xmath184 as a function of @xmath95 .",
    "the results are plotted in figure [ fig24 ] . for @xmath436 ( the solid line in the figure ) increasing @xmath95 occur first a second order @xmath440 transition and then a first order @xmath352 transition in the plane of the wall .",
    "was already shown that the surface length of the @xmath300 phase increase from zero resulting in a second order surface transition although in @xmath394 is first order .",
    "finally the length of the @xmath300 surface phase diverge continuously to infinity at the complete wetting transition point . for @xmath441 ( the dotted line in the figure )",
    "was found a first order @xmath442 transition in the plane of the wall and then the complete wetting transition .    as we can see from this figure these surface transitions although second order are very hard , i.e. there is not a jump in the graphic of @xmath443 as a function of @xmath444 but its slopes have a strong discontinuity at the transition points which translates in a discontinuity in the second derivative of @xmath417 with respect to @xmath444 as we can see from figure [ fig25 ] . in the figure",
    "is also plotted the surface tension for @xmath445 corresponding to the bulk triple point . for this value",
    "the transition to the biaxial nematic surface phase is second order ( see figure [ fig16 ] ) resulting in the continuity of @xmath446 ( @xmath267 ) at this point and then the surface tension curvature is also continuous .",
    "the coefficients @xmath447 and @xmath448 of the logarithmic divergence of @xmath182 and @xmath184 for log - normal @xmath0 have the same qualitative behaviour ( see figure [ fig26 ] ) as comparing to the schultz @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath422 ( @xmath423 ) is a increasing ( decreasing ) function of @xmath219 .",
    "as i have already shown this behaviour is due to the monotonic dependence of the differences @xmath449 ( decrease with @xmath219 ) and @xmath450 ( increase with delta ) corresponding to the coexistence between shadow nematic and cloud isotropic phases .",
    "as we can see from figure [ fig7 ] @xmath112 has a strong maximun at @xmath451 so is possible that @xmath423 becomes non monotonic function for higher @xmath219 s .",
    "finally i have studied the capillary nematization of the slit as a function of polydispersity . in @xcite",
    "was studied this phenomena for the one - component system . here",
    "i pretend to study the role of polydispersity in the possible surface transitions governed by confinement .",
    "the calculations was done in the following way . fixing the distance between two hard walls and fixing the density distribution @xmath452 of the reservoir ( which is isotropic ) in chemical equilibrium with the fluid in the slit ,",
    "i minimize ( [ eq24 ] ) , this time with an external potential which include one more wall at @xmath453 . for small values of @xmath95 the density profile",
    "is composed approximately by two wall - isotropic interfaces , but there is some @xmath454 ( which is less than the complete wetting density @xmath146 for a single wall - isotropic interface ) for which the system overcome a first order transition to a phase in which the slit is completely filled by the nematic phase .",
    "this was called capillary nematization in analogy with the usual capillary condensation @xcite .",
    "there is some value of the distance between the walls @xmath455 ( the critical point value ) for which the transition becomes second order .",
    "the natural question that arise is how depends this phenomena with polydispersity .",
    "increasing polydispersity the entropic ordering effect that has the wall on the fluid particles also increase due to the presence of large rods . then is reasonable to predict that the capillary nematization will be enhanced by polydispersity , i.e. fixing the distance between the walls the density value @xmath95 for which occur the transition will decrease with polydispersity , and the critical point should move to higher @xmath456 s as was obtained by numerical minimization .    the effect that has the polydispersity on capillary nematization is shown in figure ( [ fig27 ] ) , where are plotted the transition values @xmath455-@xmath457 . for fixed @xmath444 the width @xmath456 increase with polydispersity .",
    "using simple zwanzig model in the onsager limit for a polydisperse hard rod system i have study how depends the phase diagram topology on the selected length distribution function @xmath0 .",
    "i have found that the relevant property which affect the bulk phase behaviour is the decaying law of @xmath0 at large @xmath1 s . for distribution functions decaying exponentially or",
    "more rapidly was found a single coexistence between an isotropic and nematic phase for any polydispersity .",
    "the cloud isotropic and the shadow nematic coexisting densities are decreasing function of @xmath219 , whereas the first moments are increasing functions . for distribution functions decaying slower than an exponential",
    "always we can find a maximun extreme value for the lengths of particles ( @xmath201 ) for which the bulk phase diagram turns out to be more complex .",
    "now there is some @xmath219 for which the cloud isotropic and shadow nematic curves ( @xmath344 ) develop a triple point : one isotropic ( @xmath458 ) coexist with two different nematics ( @xmath302 and @xmath300 ) , one of them ( @xmath300 ) with a bimodal distribution function .",
    "the region of triple coexistence extend until very small values of @xmath323 which strongly depend on the decaying law and on the maximun extreme value @xmath201 .",
    "for values of @xmath323 and @xmath219 outside the triple coexistence region the shadow nematic curve becomes continuous keeping its usual behaviour ( a decreasing function of @xmath219 ) .",
    "extending in the appropriate way the interface gibbs - duhem equation for the thermodynamic of interfaces to the polydisperse system i have found that the slope of the surface tension depends on certain combination of different moment adsorption coefficients which was confirmed by numerical minimization .",
    "i have studied also the surface phase diagram of the hard rod system interacting with a hard wall for two representative families of distribution functions .",
    "each of them produce two qualitatively different surface phase diagrams . with the particular choice of the schultz s distribution function from the first family",
    "were calculated the equilibrium profiles and different adsorption coefficients .",
    "increasing the bulk density value was found some @xmath459 for which the system overcomes a second order uniaxial - biaxial nematic transition the thickness of the new biaxial nematic layer increase from zero and diverges continuously at the wetting transition density @xmath146 .",
    "both @xmath459 and @xmath146 are decreasing functions of polydispersity .",
    "for the log - normal distribution function ( a particular choice from the second family ) the surface phase diagram changes dramatically . the second order @xmath440 transition at the wall",
    "is followed by a two dimensional first order transition between two nematics ( @xmath302 and @xmath300 ) .",
    "the thickness of the @xmath300 layer increase from zero continuously and diverge at the wetting density .",
    "increasing @xmath219 this @xmath352 transition coalesce with the second order @xmath440 transition and for higher values we find a single first order @xmath460 at the wall followed by the complete wetting . for the log - normal distribution function",
    "i have obtained using the local approximation that although very hard ( the slopes of the adsorption coefficients at the transition points have strong discontinuities ) these transitions are second order in nature .",
    "was studied also the segregation phenomena occurring at the isotropic - nematic interfaces .",
    "the numerical calculations show a preferential segregation of long rods to the nematic side of the interface being very sensitive this phenomena to the degree of polydispersity .",
    "finally was shown that polydispersity enhance the capillary nematization of the slit .",
