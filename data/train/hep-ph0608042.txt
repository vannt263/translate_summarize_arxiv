    "neutrinos are massive particles @xcite , which undergo neutrino oscillations that have been first confirmed to exist for atmospheric neutrinos by the super - kamiokande collaboration @xcite .",
    "the similar neutrino oscillations @xcite have also been observed in neutrinos from the sun @xcite , from accelerators @xcite , and from reactors @xcite .",
    "masses of such neutrinos , which are much lighter than the electron mass , can be created by theoretical mechanisms such as the seesaw mechanism @xcite , and the radiative mechanism @xcite .",
    "the oscillations are interpreted as a result of the mixings among three flavor neutrinos @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , which are converted into three massive neutrinos @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 during their flight .",
    "their masses @xmath13 and mixing angles @xmath37 are currently constrained to be @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are neutrino mass differences squared given by @xmath11 ( @xmath41 @xcite ) for solar neutrinos , and @xmath42 for atmospheric neutrinos , and @xmath43 these mixing angles parameterize the pmns unitary matrix @xmath44 @xcite to give @xmath45 which transforms @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) into @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "two distinct properties are present in these observed data @xcite .",
    "one is that the mixing angle @xmath5 is suppressed to show @xmath9 but the atmospheric , and solar mixing angles @xmath53 are not suppressed , and satisfy @xmath54 .",
    "the other is that @xmath39 , and @xmath40 show the hierarchy @xmath55 .",
    "these properties may provide a great hint on how the underlying neutrino physics looks like .",
    "it has been argued that the @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry , which is based on the invariance of flavor neutrino mass terms under the interchange of @xmath7 , and @xmath8 @xcite , well describes the suppression of @xmath9 as well as the large mixings of @xmath54 .",
    "the suppression reflects the fact that this symmetry requires @xmath56 and its tiny breaking induces @xmath57 . to obtain the hierarchy",
    "@xmath55 may need an additional assumption such as that of the approximate conservation of the electron number @xcite . as another consequence of the tiny breaking of the @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry , we have discussed in ref.@xcite that the hierarchy @xmath55 can appear instead of the suppression of @xmath9 . in this case",
    ", we obtain @xmath3 ( referred to as c2 ) ) instead of @xmath2 ( referred to as c1 ) ) in the @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetric limit .",
    "has also been mentioned in ref.@xcite . ] in both cases , we have found that @xmath58 vanishes in the @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetric limit .",
    "therefore , @xmath58 is a good measure of the @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry breaking . to obtain @xmath59 from @xmath60 in c2 ) , where @xmath61 represents the @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry breaking parameter , we have to introduce another small parameter denoted by @xmath62 to cancel @xmath61 .",
    "in fact , the mixing angle @xmath4 is determined to be @xmath63 , leading to @xmath59 if @xmath64 while it vanishes as @xmath65 for a fixed @xmath62 .",
    "namely , we find that @xmath66 .",
    "any textures in c2 ) must be constrained so as to appropriately contain this small factor @xmath62 .",
    "useful relations among @xmath20 , @xmath67 , and @xmath58 @xcite have been derived on the general ground @xcite , where we rely upon the @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry breaking but not on details of textures .",
    "namely , we have found that @xmath14 for c1 ) , and @xmath15 for c2 ) .",
    "it is also discussed in ref.@xcite that the hierarchy @xmath55 in c1 ) can be accounted for by the relation @xmath68 induced by effects of @xmath28 appearing in the estimation of neutrino masses .",
    "this relation is specific to textures with @xmath69 @xcite and is found to be satisfied by the inverted mass hierarchy , and the quasi degenerate mass pattern with @xmath70 . on the other hand , in c2 ) , because of @xmath66 , it turns out that @xmath71 and @xmath72 are , respectively , satisfied for the normal and inverted mass hierarchies .",
    "it is known that the @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry is badly broken by the charged leptons .",
    "since the neutrinos and charged leptons form the @xmath73-doublets , the assumed @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry for neutrinos may not be well preserved .",
    "this fact apparently disfavors the requirement of the @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry . however , if neutrinos are majorana particles , it is theoretically possible to have an approximate @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry for neutrinos but not for charged leptons who are dirac particles .",
    "this difference can supply approximately @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetric flavor structure for neutrinos and the dominance of type ii seesaw mechanism @xcite is thus preferred @xcite .",
    "there are several examples to have the @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry for neutrinos @xcite .",
    "one way to reconcile with the difficulty is to introduce a few higgs scalars with , say , different @xmath74 parity , or other different quantum numbers associated with extra symmetries that can discriminate among various higgs scalars , where their vevs can provide charged lepton masses in such a way that the charged leptons acquire almost diagonal masses . in this case , there necessarily arise flavor - changing neutral current interactions due to the direct exchanges of these higgs scalars .",
    "such effects become sizable for quarks when quarks and leptons are unified and should be suppressed .    in this article",
    ", we construct phenomenologically viable neutrino mass textures in our categories c1 ) , and c2 ) that account for the present observed properties of neutrino oscillations .",
    "there are ten textures : two of them provide the normal mass hierarchy , other three of them provide the inverted mass hierarchy , and the remaining five of them provide the quasi degenerate mass pattern . among five textures for the quasi degenerate mass pattern , one textures for c1 ) describe neutrinos with @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "to estimate neutrino masses , and mixings , we use general formula shown in the appendix [ sec : appendix ] , where terms of @xmath28 are property taken into account to see that @xmath68 is naturally realized in some of textures for c1 ) . in the next section ,",
    "we review what was derived in ref.@xcite . in sec.[sec:3 ] , we present ten textures , where the general relations obtained in sec.[sec:2 ] are found to be indeed satisfied . in the quasi degenerate mass pattern with @xmath75 , the effective neutrino mass in @xmath30-decay is shown to be as large as 0.5 ev @xcite .",
    "the final section sec.[sec:4 ] is devoted to summary , and discussions .",
    "our neutrino mass matrix @xmath77 is parameterized by the sum of the @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetric part @xmath78 , and the symmetry breaking part @xmath79 : , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 . ]",
    "@xmath80 with @xmath81 where @xmath61 stands for a tiny @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry breaking parameter .",
    "we focus on clarifying flavor structure of @xmath77 to see how large or small each flavor neutrino mass is , and calculate neutrino masses , and mixing angles directly from @xmath77 in the normal mass hierarchy , the inverted mass hierarchy , and the quasi degenerate mass pattern.-@xmath1 symmetric flavor neutrino masses , which utilize the mass eigenstates instead of the flavor eigenstates . ] various flavor structures consistent with the observed data to be obtained in the next section are visually analyzed .",
    "there is a simple reason why eq.([eq : m_13-break ] ) leads to either @xmath82 or @xmath83 .",
    "one of the eigenvectors for @xmath78 is given by @xmath84 .",
    "it supplies a column vector placed in @xmath44 , which can be either @xmath85 or @xmath86 depending on the ordering of the eigenvalues . by comparing our eigenvector with one of these two column vectors ,",
    "we obtain that @xmath87 for @xmath85 , and @xmath88 for @xmath86 , where @xmath89 is used instead of @xmath84",
    ".    since the @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry breaking generally induces the deviation of the atmospheric neutrino mixing from the maximal one , we parameterize this deviation by @xmath90 : @xmath91 giving @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .",
    "the plus ( minus ) sign in @xmath94 corresponds to the sign for @xmath95 in eq.([eq : mixing_13case ] ) ( eq.([eq : mixing_12case ] ) ) .",
    "the estimation of the masses and the mixing angles is summarized in the appendix [ sec : appendix ] , where corrections of @xmath28 are included .",
    "it should be noted that this estimation does not recourse to the conventional perturbative expansions which provide order by order construction of eigen values ( for masses ) and eigen vectors ( for mixing angles ) because we know the exact expressions of masses and mixing angles given by eqs.([eq : exactmixingangle12])-([eq : exactmasses ] ) in the appendix [ sec : appendix ] .",
    "the suppression of @xmath39 is obviously possible if either @xmath96 is satisfied",
    ". this trivial condition can give useful relations when @xmath97 and @xmath98 calculated in the appendix [ sec : appendix ] are used .",
    "namely , the mass difference @xmath99 is connected to the quantity @xmath100 defined in eq.([eq : parameters ] ) . in c2 ) , the smallness of @xmath100 is a direct consequence of the tiny @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry breaking as can been seen form eq.([eq : x - y - delta-12 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath101 is expressed in terms of @xmath100 as @xmath102 the appearance of @xmath55 is a natural result in c2 ) . on the other hand , in c1 ) , since @xmath100 is not necessarily suppressed , the appearance of @xmath55 is not a natural result .",
    "we have to suppress @xmath100 unless the condition @xmath103 is satisfied .",
    "the additional requirements are present in c1 ) and c2 ) .",
    "first , in c1 ) , we may require that @xmath104 to realize @xmath103 in eq.([eq : masses-13 ] ) .",
    "more precisely , we demand that @xmath105 . if this is the case , we find that @xmath106 which arises from textures with @xmath107 and @xmath108    * for the inverted mass hierarchy if @xmath109 , giving @xmath110 ; * for the quasi degenerate mass pattern if @xmath111 , giving @xmath112 .",
    "these two mass patterns in c1 ) allow @xmath67 to correlate with @xmath20 .",
    "the relation eq.([eq : delta-13 ] ) has been already derived in ref.@xcite , but our reason for the appearance of this relation is a purely perturbative one focusing on the effects of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "next , in c2 ) , there are two constraints , which guarantee that @xmath9 and @xmath59 . for @xmath9",
    ", we need @xmath113 because @xmath114 in eq.([eq : mixing-12 ] ) .",

    ", we require that @xmath118 in eq.([eq : mixing-12 ] ) leading to @xmath119 only if @xmath100 cancels the effect from @xmath61 in the denominator to yield @xmath120 . therefore , we must realize that @xmath121 in c2 ) .",
    "hereafter , to suppress the contribution from @xmath116 , another small parameter denoted by @xmath62 presumably of @xmath122 is introduced .",
    "in this section , neutrino mass textures , which describe the present observed patterns of neutrino masses and mixings , are constructed .",

    "namely , @xmath265 is proportional to @xmath180 and @xmath29 rapidly increases as @xmath528 .",
    "the flavor neutrino masses receive radiative corrections if the neutrino masses are created at relatively higher scale such as @xmath529 tev .",
    "it has been argued that neutrinos in the normal mass hierarchy do not receive large radiative effects , and the form of the texture restores , at low energies , its original one @xcite .",
    "however , other two mass patterns are likely influenced by these radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "so , the proposed textures may not be respected by observed neutrinos if they are the textures determined at high energies .",
    "conversely , we should discuss how the textures realized at low energies are evolved into those realized at high energies , which may exhibit some good ordering .",
    "any underlying dynamics that respects the approximate @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry should induce , at low energies , one of our textures because the symmetry structure is not drastically disturbed .",
