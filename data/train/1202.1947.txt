    "the last decade has seen a great interest in application of concepts from quantum information theory , for example entanglement @xcite , to condensed matter theory @xcite . since entanglement represents unique quantum correlations ,",
    "the concept has been applied to exploration of phenomena in strongly correlated many - fermion systems in order to gain insight into the nature of quantum phase transitions . in this paper",
    "we show how entanglement is related with a spin correlation function and how it can be controlled by an external electric and magnetic field .",
    "we choose a system of three coherently coupled semiconducting quantum dots with three electrons , because it can be viewed as a realization of a three qubit system , which has recently been of great interest @xcite .",
    "in such the system one can find two classes of truly three - partite entangled states , represented by the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) and the werner ( w ) states @xcite .",
    "recently there are attempts to measure and control these states @xcite , as well as to apply them in logical gates @xcite . in this paper",
    "we follow a scheme for universal quantum computations , proposed by di vincenzo _ et al_. @xcite for a spin system with exchange interactions in quantum dots , in which logical qubits are encoded in the doublet subspace with @xmath0 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "recent experiments demonstrate that in three quantum dots one can perform coherent spin manipulations @xcite .",
    "it is well known that spin manipulation can be controlled by electric field , for example in the systems with the spin - orbit interactions @xcite , by applying inhomogeneous static magnetic field @xcite , by a light - induced magnetic field through the dynamical stark effect @xcite or raman transitions @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in our approach",
    "a role of the electric field is different , it modifies super - exchange coupling . in the system with a triangular geometry",
    "the electric field breaks its symmetry and changes the quantum correlations between spins .",
    "role of a magnetic flux is different , it induces spin supercurrents flowing around the triangular ring and is the main decoherence source in that kind of systems @xcite .",
    "one can expect that the magnetic flux acts destructively on the entanglement .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we show that the concurrence , as a measure of entanglement , has an explicit relation with spin correlation functions and chirality in the triple spin system .",
    "therefore one can have a simple interpretation of separability , monogamy and dark spin states .",
    "iii describes our system within the hubbard model and its canonical transformation to the heisenberg hamiltonian .",
    "we show that the electric field breaks the symmetry of the system and modifies exchange coupling , whereas the magnetic flux generates spin chirality .",

    "two spin subspaces are possible to define : quadruplets and doublets .",
    "the quadruplets are the states with the quantum spin number @xmath1 , @xmath2 and the corresponding wave functions are constructed from a triplet state in the form : @xmath3 are creation operators of an electron with the spin @xmath4 in the qubit _",

    "these states were proposed for exchange - interaction universal quantum computations @xcite . in many cases , as the one considered in the next part of the paper ,",
    "the doublet is the ground state .",
    "we assume that the system is kept coherent for a time sufficiently long in order to perform an entanglement measurement , and we fix the z - component of the total spin @xmath0 in further considerations .",

    "this construction allows us for gaining insight into monogamy and biseparability @xcite .    as a measure of the entanglement",
    "we take the concurrence . in order to calculate it @xcite",
    ", we define a reduced density matrix of a pair of electrons in the quantum dots @xmath15 and @xmath16 : @xmath17 , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath18 denote different quantum dots , and @xmath19 is a density matrix @xmath20 for the doublet subspace .",

    "we show later that in this case a spin supercurrent occurs with a nonzero value of chirality @xmath35    comparing these results with the concurrence @xmath30 ( [ c12])-([c23 ] ) one can find , after some algebra , the following relation : @xmath36 this fact allows us to propose the expectation value of spin correlation functions and chirality as an alternative measure of the entanglement .    in a multi - qubit system",
    "it is interesting to define monogamy of entanglement .",
    "if two qubits are fully quantumly entanglement then they can not be correlated with the third one @xcite . in this case",
    "one says about monogamy , which expresses the nonshareability of entanglement .",
    "for a three qubit system monogamy can be measured by the concurrence @xmath37 between a qubit _ i _ and other qubits @xmath38 , which is given by the one - tangle @xmath39 , where @xmath40 . for biseparable states @xmath41 , which means that the qubits @xmath16 and @xmath18 are fully quantumly entanglement whereas the qubit @xmath15 is separated .",

    "@xmath66 one can get an explicit form of @xmath62 : @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 one can see that the second term is proportional to @xmath70 and corresponds to the quadratic stark effect .",

    "we get @xmath79 and the system becomes uniform once again .",
    "the second term in the effective hamiltonian ( [ heisenberg ] ) describes chirality of electrons in the presence of the magnetic flux .",

    "<S> a role of magnetic flux is opposite , it leads to circulation of spin supercurrents and spin delocalization . </S>"
