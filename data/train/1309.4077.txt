    "the secondary mesons ( mostly pions ) of these interactions decay and produce a flux of high - energy neutrinos . due to their feeble interactions with matter and radiation these neutrinos can probe cr interactions over a wide energy and distance range . however , this property is also the main challenge for their detection on earth .",
    "one experimental realization consists of the detection of optical cherenkov light emission from charged particles produced in neutrino - nucleon interactions in large volumes of transparent media that are sufficiently shielded from atmospheric background .",
    "this method has been successfully applied in lake baikal , the mediterranean ( antares ) and the antarctic glacier ( amanda & icecube ) ( for a review see ref .",

    "the icecube neutrino observatory located at the geographic south pole is presently the most sensitive instrument to uncover astrophysical neutrino sources in the tev to pev energy range . in a recent paper  @xcite the icecube collaboration",
    "reported evidence for a flux of extraterrestrial neutrinos at the @xmath4 confidence level .",
    "this analysis follows up on the observation of two pev neutrino cascades within two years of operation with the 79 and 86 string configurations  @xcite .",
    "the new data set consists of 26 additional events extending the _ observed _ energy range down to 30  tev and contains 7 tracks and 19 cascades . in comparison to the expected number of @xmath5 events from atmospheric muons and neutrinos , the combined observation of 2 + 26 events corresponds to an excess with an significance of @xmath6 , increasing to @xmath7 in an _ a posteriori _ test of all 28 events  @xcite . this excess of events ( denoted `` icecube excess '' in the following ) is consistent with a diffuse and equal - flavor @xmath8-flux at the level of @xmath9 based on 17 events in the 60  tev to 2  pev energy range .",
    "the distribution of the 28 neutrino events should provide additional clues about candidate sources . utilizing the wave - form of the cherenkov light signal in individual digital optical modules the icecube collaboration managed to reconstruct the initial neutrino direction of the cascade events with a median resolution of @xmath10 to @xmath11 depending on energy . in fig .",

    "for the 21 cascade events the direction with the highest likelihood to be from a point source with a trial - corrected significance of 8% ( denoted `` hot - spot '' in the following and indicated as a square in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) is slightly off the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "five cascades ( 2 , 14 , 22 , 24 & 25 ) overlap with the hot - spot , including one of the pev cascades ( 14 ) .",
    "these events could be associated with multiple unresolved sources or an extended source close to the gc .",

    "standard fluxes of the prompt neutrino background  @xcite from the decay of charmed mesons are too low to have a significant contribution at pev energies , though model uncertainties have to be carefully accounted for  @xcite .",
    "early studies based on the preliminary energy uncertainty of the two pev events suggested a possible connection to the glashow resonance  @xcite , but the result of a dedicated follow - up analysis disfavors this possibility  @xcite .",

    "implications of the preliminary icecube results on galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays have been discussed in refs .",
    "a connection to cosmogenic neutrinos produced via the extragalactic background light seems unlikely  @xcite , unless one assumes the optimistic extragalactic background light disfavored by fermi observations of @xmath3-ray bursts along with relatively low maximum proton energies  @xcite .",
    "various pev neutrino sources including @xmath3-ray bursts , peculiar supernovae , newly - born pulsars , active galactic nuclei , star - forming galaxies and intergalactic shocks have already been suggested before the discovery of the icecube excess . in particular , the observation can be associated with extragalactic sources , _",

    "each of the three neutrinos from the decay chain @xmath15 and @xmath16 carries about one quarter of the pion energy , which is typically 20% of the initial proton energy . hence , the parent cosmic rays have energies of @xmath17  pev , above the cr _ knee _ at @xmath18  pev and close to the cr second _ knee _ ( or iron _ knee _ ) around @xmath19  pev  @xcite",
    ". cosmic rays below @xmath19  pev are thought to be still dominated by a galactic population of sources , but this does not rule out a possible sub - dominant extragalactic contribution producing pev neutrinos inside sources  @xcite or outside sources  @xcite .",
    "also , whether the sources are galactic or extragalactic , @xmath3-rays should be produced as well as neutrinos .",
    "in refs .  @xcite it was already pointed out that the `` multi - messenger connection '' between neutrinos and @xmath3-rays provides important ways to identify or constrain candidate sources of neutrinos .    in the following we will discuss general constraints on the galactic origin of the icecube excess from diffuse limits of tev - pev @xmath3-ray observatories .",
    "if the observed background neutrino flux is nearly isotropic and galactic , the galactic origin is already disfavored by pev @xmath3-ray limits .",
    "however , we stress that these diffuse @xmath3-ray constraints are biased in the northern hemisphere while most of the 28 icecube events are located in the southern hemisphere .",
    "we then discuss a possible association of ( part of ) the icecube excess with the ( quasi-)diffuse emission from the galactic plane ( gp ) and with two extended gev @xmath3-ray emission regions close to the gc , known as the _ fermi bubbles _ ( fbs ) .",
    "although there is no statistically significant neutrino event clustering at present  @xcite , we show that diffuse tev to pev @xmath3-ray surveys are an important probe to break the degeneracy between galactic and extragalactic contributions .    in the following we work in heaviside - lorentz units and",

    "we assume that sources are optically thin , which is true for many galactic cr sources , and for galactic distances the most important absorption process is the scattering of pev @xmath3-rays off the cosmic microwave background with interaction length of about 10  kpc . for sources in or close to the gc , there are additional backgrounds from interstellar radiation fields  @xcite .",
    "we do not have to take into account electromagnetic cascades since the reprocessed component appears in the lower - energy range .",

    "the icecube excess is consistent with an isotropic distribution of arrival directions .",
    "if it is truly isotropic , it is natural to assume that the neutrinos come from extragalactic sources . in principle",

    "note that @xmath73% of the contributions come from @xmath74  kpc and this fraction is higher when the realistic cr density gradient is taken into account , so pev @xmath3-ray observations are important to test this possibility .",

    "we also show upper limits on the isotropic diffuse @xmath3-ray flux by observatories listed in tab .",
    "clearly , at pev energies the required @xmath3-ray flux is already disfavored by upper limits obtained with two independent measurements , casa - mia and kascade . along with the fact that many events come from high latitudes far from the gp ,",

    "it is also important for the air shower arrays to cover the sky region where neutrinos were found by icecube . in the southern hemisphere",

    "this scenario can be excluded via future constraints on @xmath90 with continued neutrino observation in the sub - pev range and by limiting the contribution of candidate neutrino sources to the isotropic gamma - ray background .",
    "another possible galactic source of the icecube excess consists of very heavy dark matter ( dm ) in the galactic halo , which decay or annihilate into standard model particles  ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "depending on the particular model , their particle properties can be probed by neutrino and @xmath3-ray observations .",
    "the emission will be very extended and can be compared to the limits on the isotropic diffuse @xmath3-ray emission . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we indicate the galactic center region containing 25% and 50% of the local dm decay from the galactic halo .",
    "the two - body decay of the dm particle may produce pev neutrino line features with some continua  @xcite .",
    "for instance , pev dm gravitinos in @xmath91-parity violating supersymmetric models would decay into neutrinos and/or photons .",
    "note that this would also result in high - energy @xmath3-rays that may include a pev @xmath3-ray line feature  @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will discuss a simple dm scenario consisting of a scalar particle @xmath92 with mass @xmath93  pev and lifetime @xmath94  s that decays into two standard model higgs @xmath95  @xcite .",

    "we determine the energy distributions @xmath97 and @xmath98 of secondary neutrinos and @xmath3-rays , respectively , via the monte carlo code pythia  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath99-averaged diffuse galactic emission can then be calculated as @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the spherical mass density of the galactic dm halo at radius @xmath102 , which can be parametrized by the line - of - sight distance @xmath103 and angular distance @xmath104 towards the gc as @xmath105 .",
    "we use the einasto profile  @xcite @xmath106 $ ] with @xmath107 and normalization @xmath108 .    for the correct normalization of the neutrino emission it is also necessary to include extragalactic contributions which are simply given by @xmath109 where @xmath110 $ ] is the hubble constant with @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the comoving dm density is parametrized via the critical density @xmath114 and dm fraction @xmath115  @xcite .",
    "note , that the extragalactic contributions in the form of @xmath3-rays ( and electrons / positrons ) will not directly be observable , but initiate electro - magnetic cascades in the cosmic radiation backgrounds .",
    "this will populate the extragalactic @xmath3-ray background in the gev - tev energy range .",
    "the extragalactic @xmath3-ray background inferred by fermi - lat can thus also constrain this scenario  @xcite .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the total neutrino flus as a sum of eqs.([eq : dmgal ] ) and ( [ eq : dmxgal ] ) indicated as a solid gray line . for comparison ,",
    "the extragalactic contribution is indicated separately as a dashed gray line .",
    "the solid , dashed and dotted black lines show the diffuse @xmath3-ray emission from the three sky regions divided by the red dashed circles in fig .",
    "this indicates the increased diffuse emission towards the gc .",
    "note , that the gc itself is only barely visible by the experiments listed in the figure .",
    "this scenario is hence marginally consistent with the non - observation of pev @xmath3-rays .",
    "however , an observatory in the southern hemisphere covering the gc with a @xmath116  pev @xmath3-ray sensitivity comparable to that of the kascade array would be sufficient to constrain this dm model .",
    "moreover , the all - sky averaged pev @xmath3-ray flux from dm decay is in reach of future observatories like hiscore or lhaaso .    note that , in this specific dm decay scenario , the total neutrino flux is a factor of two higher than the generated @xmath3-ray flux since the neutrino flux includes extragalactic contributions .",
    "although we only consider @xmath117 for demonstration , different dm scenarios with line features or extended decay channels , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath118 can lead to increased pev @xmath3-ray emission that can already be excluded by diffuse tev - pev @xmath3-ray limits .      in the previous section",
    ", we demonstrated the power of pev @xmath3-ray searches .",
    "if the observed neutrino emission is largely isotropic and galactic , it contradicts existing pev @xmath3-ray measurements , supporting extragalactic scenarios . in principle",
    ", the observed events could come from galactic sources that do not accidentally exist in the sky region covered by various air shower arrays .",
    "indeed , more than half of icecube s events lie within this `` blind spot '' , so that we can not rule out such a possibility .",
    "but , since many events appear significantly out of the gp , powerful galactic accelerators seem to be needed even at high latitude , which is theoretically challenging .",
    "pev @xmath3-ray observations covering the icecube sky should enable us to support or exclude such speculations .",
    "a more natural situation may be that the observed icecube excess consist of a superposition of galactic and extragalactic events .",
    "in fact , icecube observes a slight excess of events in the southern hemisphere and a weak clustering of cascades close to the gc .",
    "however , we caution that there are no statistically significant fluctuations at present and accumulation of further neutrino data is required .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to see how possible event clustering by galactic sources are tested by combing pev neutrino and @xmath3-ray observations .",
    "also , event clustering due to galactic sources are theoretically possible , especially for the gp and the fbs .",
    "hereafter we consider how we identify potential galactic neutrino sources , which will become important to break a degeneracy between extragalactic and galactic contributions .    in general ,",
    "event clustering can originate from nearby bright sources or a spatial clustering of sources with average brightness . in the following we consider the possibility that the neutrino sky is a superposition of event clusters of galactic sources ( point - like or extended ) and an isotropic extragalactic background . as a result",
    ", certain regions in the icecube sky might correspond to a higher non - isotropic diffuse limit than the all - sky average . to account for local fluctuations",
    "we first construct weights of the 28 events that approximate the probability that the event is signal - like . from the diffuse flux and background expectation in the histograms of fig .  6 in ref .",
    "@xcite we extract the probabilities @xmath119 and @xmath120 that an event with deposited energy @xmath121 and declination band @xmath122 is part of the excess . for this",
    "we assume that the atmospheric neutrino background ( mostly @xmath123 ) , atmospheric muon background and the expected diffuse flux splits between tracks and cascade as @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , respectively .",
    "we then assign each event a weight @xmath127 , which we normalize such that @xmath128 , reproducing the expected overall background of events .",
    "note that this approximation can be easily extended to the true signal probability distribution in @xmath121 and @xmath129 that can be derived by monte - carlo simulations . with this method the weights of muons are much lower than the weights of the cascades except for event 13 that is an up - going muon close to the gp .",
    "this upward going muon has a large relative weight due to the small background from atmospheric muons that can not penetrate the earth far below the horizon .",
    "we then derive non - isotropic diffuse limits in the following way .",
    "we calculate the number of signal events @xmath130 in an area @xmath131 as @xmath132 where the sum runs over all 28 events with weight @xmath133 and angular probability distribution @xmath134 taken into account the angular reconstruction uncertainty .",
    "we approximate the @xmath134 in the calculation by ( normalized ) gaussian distributions .",

    "is the enhancement via the track event 13 . since the direction of the track is known within about @xmath139 the procedure of integrating events within @xmath11 results in a disc of the same radius centered at the track .",
    "different emission profiles of the extended regions can be easily adopted in this calculation .",
    "the statistical uncertainty of the icecube excess of 28 events with @xmath2 expected background events is very high .",
