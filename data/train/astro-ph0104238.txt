    "molecular cloud cores that have not yet formed a star provide the best opportunity to determine the initial conditions for star formation .",
    "the density distribution as a function of radius in such starless cores is a strong discriminator between theoretical models , and it provides an essential tool for understanding the process of collapse and star formation that follows @xcite .",
    "however , the earliest evolution of a cloud core is very poorly constrained , and its evolutionary track is unclear .    for those more evolved objects that possess infrared sources ,",
    "the sequence is well described by the empirical evolutionary sequence of @xcite , which is supported by theoretical modeling of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) @xcite . in this scheme , the well - known classification ( i.e. class i , ii and iii )",
    "is based on the near - infrared spectral index and is interpreted in terms of the sources becoming progressively less embedded in circumstellar dust .",
    "the scheme was extended to younger , more deeply embedded objects with the class 0 classification of @xcite .",
    "these objects possess a highly enshrouded iras source ( so that their seds peak longward of 100 ) ; accretion models suggest that the mass of the central object is less than or similar to that of the collapsing envelope .",
    "once a protostellar core has formed , the density distributions are strongly centrally peaked and the evolution of the objects has a `` singular '' nature in that the dynamics are primarily determined by the characteristics of the innermost regions of the cores . at earlier stages of evolution ,",
    "starless cores , defined as dense cores of gas that do not possess an iras source @xcite , are potential sites of star - formation .",
    "an important breakthrough in the study of these objects was the detection of dust continuum emission at millimeter  and submillimeter  wavelengths by @xcite , who dubbed the subset of starless cores that possess such emission `` pre - protostellar cores '' ( hereafter ppcs ) .",
    "however , unlike the class 0iii sources described above , the classification of a source as a ppc can have a much broader interpretation : the density distribution in these objects could be anything between uniform and strongly centrally peaked .",
    "they may or may not be gravitationally bound .",
    "moreover , the dynamical and evolutionary status of ppcs is poorly defined ; they may be quasi - statically contracting ( perhaps supported by non - thermal pressures ) , or in an early stage of dynamic collapse . alternatively , it is possible that a combination of magnetic , turbulent and other effects may inhibit collapse or even suppress it completely .",
    "it is crucially important to establish the physical conditions within the extended envelopes of ppcs since they will determine most of the early evolutionary history of the sources as they evolve towards main - sequence stars . in particular ,",
    "the initial conditions are highly important in defining the collapse dynamics , the likely mass of the star ( and globally , the initial mass function ) , the timescales for evolution , and the likelihood of detection of sources in different evolutionary epochs .",
    "different initial conditions lead to very different collapse dynamics .",
    "collapse from a singular isothermal sphere leads to the `` inside - out '' collapse model with a constant mass accretion rate @xcite .",
    "if collapse begins before the density distribution relaxes fully to a singular isothermal sphere , there will be an initial period of much higher mass accretion rate , followed by a declining rate of accretion @xcite .",
    "such an epoch has been identified with the class 0 objects @xcite .",
    "collapse from a logatropic sphere , which produces mass accretion rates that _ increase _ with time , has also been suggested @xcite . to address these issues ,",
    "it is necessary to understand the density and temperature distributions within the cores and to correlate them to the kinematics . in this paper",
    "we address the first of these issues .    in the original studies of ppcs @xcite , the radial distribution of the continuum emission",
    "was found to be relatively flat toward the center of the ppcs ; this _ intensity _ distribution was interpreted purely in terms of a _ density _",
    "distribution that is relatively flat within the inner core and falls off as an approximate power law at larger separations .",
    "these authors , and others , have invoked such density distributions as proof of the significance of non - thermal ( magnetic and/or turbulent ) pressure support in these objects .",
    "however , @xcite pointed out that the source statistics and , where available , the observed magnetic field strengths suggest a quantitative disagreement with the evolutionary timescales in the published ambipolar diffusion models for the quasi - static contraction of magnetized cloud cores .",
    "this conclusion has been questioned by @xcite .",
    "these conclusions are important in constraining the collapse process , but previous interpretations of the data assumed that the dust temperature is uniform throughout the cores .",
    "we will argue that the interpretations of the observational data are profoundly affected by this assumption .",
    "early calculations for dust clouds heated by the external radiation field found that the temperature declined to very low values in the interior @xcite ; more recently @xcite have applied a semi - analytic technique and come to similar conclusions .    in this paper , we constrain the density and temperature profiles of a small sample of ppcs , utilizing high quality observational data and a dust continuum radiative transfer code @xcite .",
    "we consider a range of physical models for the density distribution , calculating the dust temperature distribution in each case in a self - consistent way .",
    "the model clouds are then  observed \" to mimic the observational technique ( including the effects of the telescope beam power pattern and chopping ) in order to compare to actual observations .",
    "although several sources of observational data are considered , the primary observational comparison is to our recent 450@xmath1 m and 850@xmath1 m data obtained with the scuba on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) @xcite .",
    "we consider the simplest physical situation of thermally supported , gravitationally bound , spherically symmetric clouds . while all three cores modeled here have some degree of turbulence , it is subsonic in l1512 and l1544 or barely sonic in l1689b ; the effects of turbulence should not be dramatic in these very quiescent cores .",
    "the solution for the thermally - supported , isothermal cloud is the bonnor - ebert sphere , which can be generalized to account for a temperature gradient ( see below ) .",
    "in addition to the thermally supported bonnor - ebert spheres , we have also considered a singular sphere , for which @xmath2 , normalized to match a bonnor - ebert model at the outer radius .",
    "magnetically supported cores have also been suggested @xcite .",
    "the latter authors have presented density profiles that are specifically appropriate to l1544 .",
    "although a comparison with these models would be of great interest , the inclusion of magnetic pressures necessarily implies significant deviations from spherical symmetry  in fact , highly flattened disk - like structures are predicted . after some attempts to capture the essence of these models in the one dimensional models we consider here , it became clear that a fully two dimensional treatment is required .",
    "we defer discussion of these magnetic models to future work but discuss the possible effects of asphericity on our modeling in  [ caveats ] .",
    "we have considered two types of hydrostatic pressure - balanced cloud :    1 .",
    "`` classical '' isothermal bonnor - ebert spheres , in which @xmath3 ; and 2 .   modified bonner - ebert spheres with a gradient in the kinetic temperature .    if the gravitationally bound clouds are non - magnetic , are not subject to any large - scale systemic velocity flows ( rotation , infall , or outflow ) , and are purely supported by thermal pressure , then the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium are as follows : @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the radius , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the pressure and density respectively at @xmath6 , and @xmath9 is the total mass enclosed within @xmath6 .",
    "if the clouds are isothermal , the equation of state is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the isothermal sound speed ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath1 is the average molecular mass in the gas , and @xmath14 is the mass of the hydrogen atom ) .    with an appropriate change of variables to a dimensionless form , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the central density , these equations yield a single solution , with the maximum value of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) as the only free parameter ( cf",
    ". foster & chevalier , 1993 ) , which is determined by pressure balance with the surrounding medium . if @xmath20 , which corresponds to a center - to - edge density contrast of @xmath21 , then the sphere is unstable to perturbations and subsequent gravitational collapse .",
    "the marginal case is the `` critical bonnor - ebert sphere '' ( ebert 1955 , bonnor 1956 ) .",
    "the solution corresponds to a family of spheres of differing central density [ cf .",
    "fig . 1 of @xcite ] .",
    "the density structure of the outer envelopes is closely approximated by @xmath2 , but the density approaches a constant value at small @xmath6 . for a given temperature , higher values of @xmath17 yield models with smaller cores .",
    "the most extreme form of the unstable bonnor - ebert sphere has an infinite central density ( corresponding to @xmath22 ) .",
    "this is the singular isothermal sphere , in which @xmath2 throughout .",
    "the modified bonnor - ebert spheres include the effects of radial temperature variations . in these cases , @xmath23 , \\ ] ] and , using @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the number density , equation 2 becomes @xmath26 and , from hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath27    in all of our models the mean molecular mass is @xmath28 , consistent with @xmath29 .",
    "the inner radius ( ) is not constrained by observations and is simply set small enough ( 25 au ) that it does not affect the results , as shown by tests that used @xmath30 au . the free parameters in the isothermal bonnor - ebert models are thus the central density ( ) , the outer radius ( ) and the gas kinetic temperature ( ) .",
    "most models have an outer radius of 34 au , but some have an  of 1.54 or 64 au .    for most of our models ( see table 1 ) we have used the isothermal bonnor - ebert configurations with @xmath31 k. the density distribution from a sequence of these models ( with different central densities , ) is shown in figure 1a .",
    "a few isothermal models were computed for different values of  to examine the sensitivity of the density structure to the temperature ( fig .",
    "the main effect of changing the assumed  is to change the size of the central core and the mass ( table 1 ) .    for all cases with @xmath32 , the density contrast between the edge and the center of the cores exceeds 14.3 , implying that they are unstable to collapse . for the isothermal bonnor - ebert spheres of fixed temperature and outer radius ,",
    "the enclosed mass is only slightly sensitive to the central density ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "since the photometric fluxes are largely determined by the masses within the beams , observations of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) alone can not place very strong constraints on the central densities of bonnor - ebert spheres .",
    "however , by modeling the radial intensity distribution it is possible to discriminate between models with different central densities , which have different density _",
    "distributions_.    in order to generate the non - isothermal bonnor - ebert spheres it is necessary to pre - define the temperature profile . in practice , this is achieved by using an appropriately defined isothermal bonnor - ebert model as the input for the radiative transfer code to generate the dust temperature profile ( see  [ isrf ] ) .",
    "this  is then used to re - calculate the density profiles in the non - isothermal model .",
    "obviously , the corrected density profile could then be used to generate a second iteration for the temperature profile etc . , but the magnitude of the corrections in the second and higher order iterations is sufficiently small for them to be neglected . the correction for non - isothermality results in a smaller core and an initially steeper density profile ( fig .",
    "1c ) , caused by the second term in equation 6 , with @xmath34 . beyond radii of about 5000 au , the first term in equation 6 dominates , and the smaller enclosed mass ( caused by the smaller core ) leads to a shallower density profile .",
    "the _ total _ mass is larger because the mass is dominated by the outer regions . the shallower density profile in the outer envelope decreases the center to edge density contrast ( e.g. in the case of @xmath35 @xmath36 , @xmath37 au , by a factor of @xmath381.8 ) .",
    "note that the radiative transfer code computes the radial profile of the _ dust _ temperature , , whereas the equilibrium configuration is determined by the _ gas _",
    "kinetic temperature , . while efficient gas - dust coupling forces  to equal   at high densities , at densities below about 14 to 34 , @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "although these models are a theoretical improvement on the isothermal bonnor - ebert sphere , a full calculation of the gas energetics , including dust coupling , would be needed to make fully self - consistent models .",
    "all the models of the density profiles are tabulated in table [ physmods ] .",
    "all densities are specified as the number density of particles .",
    "the notation tbe implies a non - isothermal bonnor - ebert model in which the density structure was computed assuming that @xmath40 , where @xmath41 was computed from the initial isothermal be model with the same  ( model number denoted by the superscript ) .",
    "we again emphasize the distinction between  and  by using the term isothermal only to refer to the assumption about  used to compute the density distribution .",
    "the _ dust _ temperature in these isothermal be models is _ not _ constant (  [ isrf ] ) .",
    "the radiative transport code of @xcite , modified to use an arbitrary density distribution , computed  for each physical model .",
    "we first explored the dependence of the temperature profiles on the assumed form of the interstellar radiation field ( ) .",
    "figure 2 shows a comparison of two estimates of the .",
    "previous calculations with the radiative transfer code ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) have used an  similar to that of @xcite , supplemented by a blackbody for the cosmic background radiation ( hereafter  mmp \" ) .",
    "more recent analyses , using the cobe data , indicate a stronger  in the infrared @xcite .",
    "significant departures from the  mmp \" isrf occur between 5 and 400 .",
    "we have modified the @xcite  at the shorter ultraviolet  wavelengths ( @xmath42 ) using equations given by @xcite , which reproduce the   of @xcite .",
    "the differences between the  mmp \" and the black - draine models of the are quite substantial , reaching a factor of 1.8 in parts of the ultraviolet , and a factor of 13 in parts of the infrared .",
    "figure 3 compares temperature profiles using the two different models of the , with the same physical model : a bonnor - ebert sphere with a central density of 16  and uniform kinetic temperature , @xmath43 k. the differences in  are small ( @xmath44 k ) , but the biggest differences are at the cold center of the cloud , where a small change in  can potentially have a major impact on the emission .",
    "comparison of the emitted fluxes calculated for different wavelengths and beams indicate modest changes ( less than 15% ) for @xmath45 , but bigger changes at shorter wavelengths . in our modeling",
    ", we use the black - draine model as the standard representation of the isrf .",
    "dust opacities in molecular clouds clearly differ from those in the general interstellar medium . observations of regions forming massive stars @xcite have been well - matched by a set of opacities calculated for grains that have grown by coagulation and accretion of thin ice mantles for 5 years at a density of 6 , listed in column 5 of @xcite ( hereafter oh5 ) .",
    "this model of the dust opacity is therefore probably appropriate to the cold , quiescent cloud cores that are the subject of this study .",
    "we adopt these opacities as the standard model and explore the effect of using different opacities .",
    "as discussed below , the excellent agreement between the observational data and our physical models strongly supports the validity of these opacity laws .    as a specific alternative to oh5",
    ", we consider the opacities in column 2 of @xcite ( hereafter oh2 ) , which include coagulation but lack ice mantles",
    ". these may be more appropriate in regions where young stars have heated the grains enough to remove the mantles .",
    "the model opacities are larger at 1300  than in the oh5 grain models by a factor of about 2.2 ( fig .",
    "2 ) . both the oh5 and the oh2 dust models result in considerably higher opacities at long wavelengths ( by a factor of 6.4 for oh2 at 1300 ) than for models in which the grains have not undergone coagulation ( e.g. , column 1 of @xcite .    however , despite these differences , we find that the effect of the opacity law on  is small ; the largest difference is at the inner radius , where oh2 opacities give a   that is lower by 0.5 k than that obtained with the oh5 opacity model .",
    "because the very low temperatures of the dust grains in the centers of dense cores have a major impact on the interpretation of the submillimeter   emission (  [ models ] to  [ specmodels ] ) , it is important to consider all other possible heating mechanisms in addition to the absorption of the ambient isrf .",
    "the primary source of energy deep inside opaque cloud cores is provided by cosmic rays .",
    "we consider direct deposition of energy in dust grains by cosmic rays , absorption of ultraviolet photons produced by secondary cosmic ray excitation of  molecules , and , finally , energy transfer from possibly warmer gas heated by the cosmic rays .",
    "for the purpose of a comparative study , we consider a representative grain of radius 0.1 , absorption properties given by oh5 dust , and a cosmic ray ionization rate @xmath46 s@xmath47 .",
    "this value is near the maximum found in recent investigations @xcite .",
    "the most recent estimates indicate @xmath48 s@xmath47 , based on modeling of h@xmath49co@xmath50 observations @xcite , which is in good agreement with direct measurements by the voyager and pioneer spacecraft @xcite . consequently , the value that we have adopted should provide a strong upper limit to the cosmic ray heating . in each case , we compare the heat input to a grain to the radiative cooling by a grain at a temperature of 5 k , somewhat lower than the value of  reached at the center of the cores . because the dust in the code is in radiative equilibrium , the cooling rate sets a lower limit on the heating rate due to the isrf . at this temperature",
    "the power emitted by our representative grain , obtained by integrating over the product of the planck function and the emission cross section for oh5 dust , is 4.0 erg s@xmath47 .",
    "firstly , we consider the direct cosmic ray heating of dust particles .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , the energy input is maximized if we assume that all cosmic ray ionizations are caused by 1 mev protons .",
    "then , our value of @xmath51 implies a flux of protons of 4.8 @xmath52s@xmath47 , each of which can deposit 6.13 kev in the representative grain described above @xcite .",
    "this results in an energy deposition rate per grain of 2.1 erg s@xmath47 , 190 times smaller than the radiative heating .",
    "secondly , we consider the effect of ultraviolet photons created following the cosmic ray ionization of h@xmath53 .",
    "this process yields energetic electrons that are capable of collisionally exciting electronic states of h@xmath53 , which decay producing a spectrum of ultraviolet photons @xcite .",
    "estimates of the flux of these photons range from 1.43 @xcite to 14 @xmath52s@xmath47 @xcite .",
    "a calculation of particular relevance is that of @xcite , who include the effects of a density gradient and internal extinction of the photons .",
    "they consider a centrally condensed cloud with properties similar to those that we infer for pre - protostellar cores and find a maximum photon flux near the center of of @xmath54 photons @xmath52 s@xmath47 , for @xmath55 s@xmath47 .",
    "scaling to our adopted value of @xmath51 gives @xmath56 photons @xmath52 s@xmath47 as a maximum value .",
    "if all of these photons are at a wavelength of 120 nm [ this probably overestimates the average photon energy , @xcite ] , then the energy deposition per grain is @xmath57 which is 18 times smaller than the heating rate due to the external isrf .",
    "finally , we consider heating of dust grains by collisions with warmer gas particles .",
    "the energy deposition rate depends on the gas temperature , which is poorly constrained .",
    "however , we can put a limit to the _ total _ heating caused by cosmic ray heating of the gas by assuming that _ all _ of the energy input to the gas is transferred to the dust .",
    "this is clearly a gross upper limit since much of the energy will be radiated away in molecular emission .",
    "the volume rate of heating by cosmic rays @xcite is @xmath58 assuming that @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the number densities of h@xmath53 molecules and dust grains , respectively , the upper limit of the heating rate per grain is 1.3 erg s@xmath47 ; still a factor of 3 less than the heating by the isrf . in principle , we could also consider the heating of the gas by the isrf in the outer parts of the core , but our main concern is whether or not the central regions of the cores are as cold as our models predict . in any case , the density in the outer regions is too low for the gas and dust temperatures to be well coupled .",
    "we conclude that heating by the isrf dominates other possible heat sources for dust grains , even deep inside an opaque core .",
    "recent calculations of gas and dust energetics , including the effects of depletion on the coolants , support the conclusion that the gas can not substantially raise the dust temperature @xcite .",
    "the primary observational data that the models must reproduce are the radial profiles of intensity at 450 and 850 , as presented by @xcite . for some sources , intensity profiles at 1300  obtained with the iram 30-m telescope also exist .",
    "we model the radial intensity distribution , @xmath62 , as a function of impact parameter ( @xmath63 ) , normalized to the innermost impact parameter , corresponding to one quarter of the beamwidth .",
    "this measure is thus sensitive to the normalized density and temperature _ distributions _ , while the sed is sensitive to the isrf and a quantity that is proportional to the product of total mass within the beam and the opacity .",
    "thus , modeling the _ normalized _ radial intensity distribution and the sed separately provide roughly orthogonal constraints on different model variables .",
    "photometric data , summarized by @xcite , can constrain the isrf , mass , and model opacities . of course , photometric data obtained with _",
    "different _ beams at the same wavelength retain some sensitivity to the density and temperature distributions .    to model correctly the radial intensity distribution , one must calculate the emission from a model cloud , with a self - consistent , convolve the emission with the observed beam shape , and `` chop '' the model in the same way as the data were chopped during the observations .",
    "the calculation of  is done with the code of @xcite .",
    "figure 4 shows that more centrally condensed cores ( higher ) result in lower dust temperatures in the interior ( as expected ) , but somewhat higher dust temperatures at larger radii until all models converge to about the same value at the edge of the cloud .",
    "a second code then uses these density and temperature profiles [ @xmath64 and ] to calculate the angular dependence of the emission at specific wavelengths , convolves with the observed beam , and uses a numerical simulation of the chopping that was used in obtaining the data to produce a predicted intensity profile , normalized in the same way as the data ( ) . the simulation of chopping in a one dimensional code can not replicate exactly the observations at large impact parameters .",
    "we limit our comparison of models to data to ranges of @xmath63 where the predictions are insensitive to the exact model of chopping .",
    "in addition , the ratio of the normalized intensities at the two wavelengths [ @xmath65 is computed to examine possible variations in the spectral index with radius .",
    "figure 4 shows how the predicted intensity distributions are affected by the assumed form of the density distribution .",
    "although the more condensed models lead to more rapid declines of the density with radius , beam convolution and chopping , as shown in figure 4c and 4d , makes the difference less striking than one might expect [ see also fig . 1 of @xcite ] .",
    "for the 1300  data obtained with the 30-m iram telescope , the beam power pattern is available from the literature , but the data can not be completely modeled because they were obtained with multiple chopper throws and restored . to bracket the range , we ran models with no chopping and models with a 120  chop , based on an estimate of where the iram data begin to lose sensitivity ( p. andr , pers .",
    "clearly , some loss of signal at large impact parameters has occurred because the unchopped models do not reproduce the declines seen in the multiply - chopped data , but chopping at 120  may overestimate the effect .",
    "modeling the sed allows tests of different aspects of the models : the isrf , the assumed dust opacities , and the mass within the beams .",
    "in particular , far - infrared  data constrain the isrf , while submillimeter  data constrain the product of mass and submillimeter  opacity .",
    "photometric data are quite variable in quality ; most references do not provide a beam shape and the data often represent the emission integrated over a map . in these cases , we assume a gaussian beam .",
    "in addition , calibration uncertainties are hard to quantify .",
    "far - infrared data from  exist @xcite and @xcite , but the flux density estimates were being revised to correct for background subtraction . while this paper was being refereed , the new measurements became available @xcite .",
    "the new results require an isrf lower than used in our models , but the conclusions about the best density model are unaffected .",
    "consequently , only a few new models were calculated for each source to illustrate the effects of the lower isrf .",
    "these new results strongly support our conclusions that the dust temperatures are very low in the centers of these cores    the agreement between the model and the data can be quantified in terms of the reduced chi - squared @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the uncertainty in the data and @xmath68 is the number of data points ; only points spaced by a full beam are used in computing to avoid introducing correlations . because the  measure gives great weight to a few discrepant points and/or points with small uncertainties , we have also computed the mean absolute deviation , as used in robust estimation : @xmath69 the statistics were computed separately for each observation .",
    "generally , the computations were carried out to angular distances of about 60 , beyond which inability to simulate chopping exactly make the comparison dubious for the scuba data .",
    "a similar calculation with the flux densities ( ) was used for comparing the observed and model seds . in tables",
    "[ l1689b.res ] to [ l1512.res ] , we report the _ sum _ of the  for the 450 and 850  data , as well as , but only  for the comparison to 1300  data and the sed .",
    "the sum of  for the scuba data is always dominated by the 850  data because of the smaller uncertainties , whereas the   weights the 450  and 850  data more equally .",
    "for the 1300  data , two values for  are given in tables [ l1689b.res][l1512.res ] , the chopped value first , and the unchopped value second . in the figures , the chopped prediction for 1300  is shown as a dashed line , whereas the solid line indicates unchopped models .",
    "the  values for the sed in most table entries do not include the new far - infrared  data of @xcite ; two models for each source , at the bottom of each table , do include these data in the  calculation .",
    "for l1689b , we assume a distance of 125 pc , rather than the traditional 160 pc , based on improved determinations by @xcite , and @xcite , which are supported by the distance to upper scorpius @xcite .",
    "the scuba data on this source @xcite have fairly good signal - to - noise and the source shape as projected onto the plane of the sky is reasonably circular , away from the central region .",
    "the higher contour levels are somewhat elongated and may even have weak multiple peaks .",
    "thus , our spherical models can only be approximations to the actual source .",
    "in addition to the scuba data , we consider the iram 1300  map @xcite . as stated above ,",
    "because these data were taken with multiple chopper throws and restored , we can not simulate the effects of chopping as we can for the scuba data ; thus we weight the agreement with the 1300  data much less in deciding which models are best .    for most of the models of l1689b ,",
    "whose results are summarized in table [ l1689b.res ] , we adopt the simple , isothermal bonnor - ebert description of the density distribution . in these models ,",
    "the primary variable is the degree of central condensation , measured by .",
    "the inner radius was fixed at 25 au , the outer radius at 34 au , and the dust opacity was oh5 .",
    "the  and @xmath70 values for the scuba data show a clear minimum around @xmath71 ; the 1300  data favor @xmath72 .",
    "the model with @xmath71  is a good compromise , and we adopt that value as our standard model in testing the effect of other parameters .",
    "we also explored the effects of using non - isothermal bonnor - ebert models , which may be a more realistic description of the density distribution .",
    "the differences in the predicted intensity distributions were very small .",
    "the effects of chopping make the data quite insensitive to the outer radius .",
    "a model with an inner radius of 50 au was essentially indistinguishable from the standard model , as was a model with @xmath73 au .",
    "decreasing the outer radius to 1.54 au has very little effect on the scuba or 1300  fits .",
    "we have also considered the effects of adopting different dust opacities .",
    "models using oh2 dust opacities differed little from those with oh5 dust opacities in the fits to the scuba and the 1300  data , but the agreement with the sed worsened substantially . because oh2 dust has a higher opacity at long wavelengths , these models produced too much flux .",
    "the excess flux could not be decreased by varying  within the range favored by the intensity profiles because the amount of mass in the beam changes little with .",
    "it is remarkable in fact that oh5 dust opacity and a bonnor - ebert density distribution fits the sed so well .",
    "if we were sure that the cloud is hydrostatic and thermally pressure - balanced , so that a bonnor - ebert sphere is the correct physical model , then we could constrain the dust opacities quite strongly .    the new far - infrared  data @xcite",
    "are about half the values previously reported , indicating lower , and thus a lower value for the isrf than assumed in our models .",
    "the last two models in table [ l1689b.res ] include these new data .",
    "the first retains the original isrf , while the second scales the isrf by a factor of 0.5 , clearly improving the  for the sed . the latter model is shown in fig",
    ". 5 , including the temperature profile , the 450/850 @xmath1 m intensity ratio , the sed , and fits to the 450 , 850 , and 1300 @xmath1 m normalized intensity profiles .    given the substantial uncertainties , the model fits the data well .",
    "in particular , the data suggest ( with big uncertainties ) a rise in the ratio toward the edge of the cloud .",
    "the model correctly predicts this behavior which arises almost equally as a result of the increase in  at the edge of the cloud and as an effect of chopping . in principle , deviations of the data from the model could be used to study possible changes in dust properties with radius , but better signal - to - noise in the 450  data is needed before it is possible to make quantitative analyses . for the present",
    ", we note that any attempt to model the distribution of dust properties must incorporate careful considerations of spatial variations in the dust temperature and the effects of chopping .",
    "we can also compare the actual values of the spectral index @xmath74 to the observations @xcite .",
    "the best model produces @xmath75 in the 40  beam and @xmath76 in the 120  beam ( see @xcite for the definition of @xmath74 .",
    "these values are consistent within uncertainties with the @xmath74 seen in the observations ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "we may ask how our conclusions compare to the previous studies of @xcite ( awm ) .",
    "firstly , awm assume a distance of 160 pc and an opacity at 1300 of @xmath78",
    "@xmath79 gm@xmath47 of gas , whereas the corresponding value for the oh5 dust opacity is @xmath80 @xmath79 gm@xmath47 ( assuming a gas to dust ratio of 100 ) . in comparing results ,",
    "we adjust the results of awm to our assumed distance and opacity .",
    "the other main difference is that awm assumed a constant @xmath81 k , whereas we compute @xmath41 and find it to be lower everywhere , especially toward the center of the cores . because the lower  depresses emission from the center substantially ( reducing the temperature from @xmath81 k to @xmath82 k results in a flux reduction by a factor of 4 at @xmath83 )",
    ", we find higher central densities ( by factors of 310 ) and a smaller radius ( by factors of 0.50.9 ) for the flattened part of the density distribution .",
    "the smallest differences are found in the model with @xmath84 .",
    "the mass inside 4 au is more similar ; our mass ( 0.95 ) is 1.4 times higher than that of @xcite .",
    "both studies agree that the density distribution outside the flat portion is well represented by a power law ( @xmath85 ) with @xmath86 .",
    "@xcite have re - analyzed the 1300  data , assuming a constant  of 12.5 k and incorporating an analysis of the absorption at @xmath87  that the cloud shows in isocam data .",
    "they also find a density distribution that shows a distinction between a `` flat '' inner region and an envelope in which the density distribution can be described by a power law , roughly consistent with @xmath88 .",
    "they also find that bonnor - ebert spheres fit their data quite well .",
    "however , they find that the radius of the flat density core is 50006000 au , 3 times larger than we find",
    ". this  would correspond roughly to our bonnor - ebert sphere with @xmath89 , which fits neither our scuba data nor the 1300  data , in our analysis .    in principle , the absorption method does not depend on , thereby providing a complementary probe .",
    "however , the complication arises in the determination of the foreground emission , which veils the absorption by the core .",
    "@xcite use the 1300  data to constrain this foreground emission and conclude that the foreground is almost entirely zodiacal emission , so that the cloud must be illuminated entirely from behind . with this assumption ,",
    "they find @xmath90 ; if there is more foreground veiling , the cloud could have @xmath91 at 7 , as our models indeed predict .",
    "another variable is the opacity at 7 .",
    "@xcite assume an opacity that translates to @xmath92 @xmath79 gm@xmath47 of gas , whereas the oh5 dust opacity would imply @xmath93 @xmath79 gm@xmath47 .",
    "@xcite also find evidence from the density profiles for an outer cut - off radius to the core .",
    "since the core is flattened , this cut - off radius is variable , but taking the geometric mean of the two axes and correcting to a distance of 125 pc yields a radius of @xmath94 au , similar to our outer radius , but outside the region that we effectively probe .",
    "while it is difficult to sort out all of these issues , it seems likely that the discrepancy between our models and those of @xcite imply that either they have underestimated the foreground veiling and hence @xmath95 or we have underestimated the dust temperatures .",
    "the new results in the far - infrared  are well matched by our low , supporting our interpretation .",
    "because the absorption measurements provide an independent measure of the distribution , this difference leaves a puzzle for further work .",
    "we conclude that bonnor - ebert spheres and oh5 dust opacities reproduce the observations of l1689b very well , with @xmath96 .",
    "this density is higher and  is smaller than have been found in other studies .",
    "l1544 is at a distance of 140 pc @xcite .",
    "the scuba data have slightly better signal to noise than those of l1689b .",
    "while the source is clearly elongated @xcite , we model it as a sphere .",
    "since the radial profiles are spherical averages , this is the most consistent comparison for the present .",
    "ultimately , aspherical models should be constructed , but we address the likely effects in  [ caveats ] .",
    "in addition , we model 1300  data , subject to the same caveats as for l1689b : in particular , we do not expect to fit the intensity profile at large impact parameters .",
    "magnetic collapse models have been developed for this source @xcite .",
    "using their semi - analytic calculation of dust temperature , @xcite find good agreement between this model and the data .",
    "because we focus on spherically averaged data here , we do not attempt to compare this magnetic model to our data .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ l1544.res ] .",
    "first , considering only simple bonnor - ebert spheres , a model with @xmath71 has the lowest  for the scuba data , as well as the 1300 data and the sed .",
    "the model with @xmath97  has nearly as good a value of @xmath70 , but is slightly worse on the other measures .",
    "density profiles appropriate to non - isothermal bonnor ebert spheres fit somewhat worse for @xmath71 , but slightly better for @xmath98  than their isothermal counterparts .",
    "most of the models did not include any far - infrared  data in the calculation of the sed  value .",
    "the last two models in table [ l1544.res ] include the new far - infrareddata in the sed  value . as with l1689b",
    ", the fit is greatly improved with a lower isrf .",
    "the isothermal bonnor - ebert model with the isrf decreased by 0.6 and @xmath71  is shown in figure 6 .",
    "the spectral index , @xmath74 , agrees well with the observations .",
    "because models with very high  do not fit the data too badly , we have also considered the extreme limit of a singular sphere ( @xmath99 ) , normalized to have the same density at @xmath100 as the bonnor - ebert sphere with @xmath98 .",
    "this power law model has the density distribution of a singular isothermal sphere at a temperature of 10.4 k @xcite .",
    "we considered two models of this type : the first ( ipl2 ) assumed a constant dust temperature of 10 k. this model produced intensity profiles that are too strongly peaked in the inner core , confirming the conclusions of @xcite that power law density distributions _ with constant  _ can not fit the data .",
    "a second model ( tpl2 ) used the radiative transfer code to compute self - consistently .",
    "surprisingly , this model fits the scuba data reasonably well . while the fit to the 1300  data was clearly worse , our data can not rule out a simple power law density model _ with a self - consistent  _ for l1544 , given the current uncertainties in the data and the modeling . figure 7 compares the results for the two power law models ; it shows how important it is to include the self - consistent  in analyzing intensity distributions .    as with l1689b",
    ", we compare our results to those obtained from the analysis of 1300  emission @xcite and 7  absorption @xcite .",
    "the assumed distance is the same in all three studies , but ( as for l1689b ) the opacities differ .",
    "@xcite find @xmath71 using the oh5 value of @xmath101 , while @xcite find @xmath102 , or @xmath103 if oh5 opacities are correct at 7 .",
    "the radius of the flat - density - profile inner core ranges from 0 to 1600 au in our models , compared to 2500 au @xcite or 2900 au @xcite .",
    "the latter authors also identify an outer ( cut - off ) radius of 8900 au .",
    "this is close to the size where our chopping and source asphericity makes it difficult to constrain the density distribution . as with l1689b ,",
    "our results are qualitatively similar to other analyses , but differ quantitatively ; the differences suggest either that we have underestimated  or that the optical depth at 7  has been underestimated .    as for l1689b ,",
    "bonnor - ebert spheres and oh5 dust fit the data well .",
    "our most striking conclusion that is different from the other studies is that our data _ do not _ rule out a singular power - law density distribution .",
    "l1512 is also at a distance of 140 pc , but the submillimeter  emission is much weaker than from l1544 . while the observational constraints are clearly much weaker than for the other sources , it is interesting to model l1512 because it seems to have a flatter distribution of intensity than the other sources .",
    "@xcite presented only the 850  data , but the 450  data does have a definable intensity distribution .",
    "both the 450  and the 850  data and some photometry constrain the models .",
    "the photometry was collected in tables in @xcite , except for a datum at 1300  from @xcite .",
    "the results for l1512 are given in table [ l1512.res ] .",
    "for this source we have only considered simple bonnor - ebert density distributions  the poor data quality precludes the consideration of more sophisticated models .",
    "the best fit is for @xmath89 , with @xmath104  also acceptable .",
    "l1512 is clearly less centrally condensed than the other cores .",
    "the last two models in table [ l1512.res ] include the new far - infrareddata in the sed  value .",
    "the fit is clearly very bad for the full isrf ; the fit is much improved for an isrf decreased by 0.3 , but it is still worse than for l1689b and l1544 .",
    "the last model is shown in fig . 8 .",
    "the problem with the sed is that the model fluxes are all higher than the observed values .",
    "however , good fits are obtained for the intensity profiles and the spectral index is consistent with the observations . models with lower",
    "fit the lower fluxes better , but do not fit the intensity distribution .",
    "if the dust opacities are the same as in the other sources , fitting to the sed requires the core to be less massive .",
    "bonnor - ebert spheres calculated with @xmath105 k contain less mass , and a model with @xmath104  fits both the scuba data and the sed best ( table [ l1512.res ] ) .",
    "however , such models are hard to justify on physical grounds ; the radiative transport calculation produces @xmath106 k everywhere ( a model with @xmath107 k fits the sed very poorly ) . while the density is too low to require @xmath108 , one would have to invoke unusually low gas heating to produce @xmath109 k. another way to decrease the emission from the model cloud is to use different dust opacities ; values between those of oh5 and uncoagulated grains [ e.g. , column 1 of @xcite ] would give about the right amount of emission .",
    "such grains are plausible ; if l1512 is a younger source , it will have spent less time at densities that are sufficiently high for grain coagulation to occur .",
    "l1512 was detected at 1300  by @xcite but was too weak to map .",
    "it was also included in the absorption study by @xcite , but the absorption was too weak to analyze .",
    "these results are consistent with our finding that the mass and central density are less than in l1689b and l1544 .",
    "the radial profiles of l1512 can be matched if the source is a bonnor - ebert sphere with a central density smaller than those of l1689b and l1544 .",
    "the fact that the masses of bonnor - ebert spheres , together with the oh5 dust opacities @xcite match the submillimeter  fluxes so well suggests that both the physical and dust models may be reasonable .",
    "however , the opacity and mass effectively enter as a product ; consequently , other mass and opacity combinations can not be ruled out .",
    "another caveat is that our models are one - dimensional .",
    "some of the cores ( l1544 most notably ) are clearly aspherical and ( at least ) two - dimensional radiative transfer models should be used to interpret the data .",
    "we can get a crude estimate of the effect of asphericity on the temperature distribution .",
    "comparing  for models with the same but a factor of 2 smaller  simulates the effects on heating of having one dimension smaller than the other .",
    "in fact , the differences are very small except near the surface of the cloud ( @xmath110 k , or 3% , for @xmath111 au )",
    ". semi - analytic calculations of  in a two - dimensional geometry @xcite find modest differences in the along long and short axes .",
    "differences in the assumed density law will produce different in general , as can be seen from fig .",
    "however , if one plots the  versus column density , the behavior is much more universal , as would be expected .",
    "this is shown in fig . 9 for a variety of density profiles .",
    "the curves of  track each other until they approach their maximum value , where geometrical effects near the center of the cloud cause them to deviate from models with higher total column density .",
    "this figure may be useful for those modeling different density distributions who do not have access to a radiative transport code .",
    "for example , the @xmath112 k computed from gray - body fits to the sed @xcite for l1689b and l1544 would correspond to the model  at about 1/3 the total column density into the cloud ; in contrast , the radius at which @xmath113 k is about @xmath114 au ( figs . 5 and 6 ) , about 0.13 of the outer radius , enclosing 0.15 of the total mass .",
    "clearly , gray - body fits to a constant  weight radius , column density , and mass differently , depending on the detailed density and temperature distributions .",
    "local variations in the isrf are another source of uncertainty .",
    "if local sources increase the strength of the isrf ,  will increase .",
    "however , in practice , large changes in the isrf strength are needed for significant variations to occur . approximately , @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the isrf luminosity and @xmath117 is the power - law index for the opacity ( @xmath118 ) @xcite . for typical values of @xmath117 ,",
    "the exponent is only 0.2 to 0.25 , so that doubling the isrf strength will increase the dust temperature by just 15 - 20% .",
    "full radiative transfer models run with higher isrf strengths confirm this simple analysis .",
    "figure 3 shows the  calculated for the same physical model , but with the black - draine isrf multiplied by a factor of 2 ( except for the cosmic background radiation ) .",
    "the temperatures are higher at all radii by a factor around 1.14 , as would be predicted by the simple relations above .",
    "in fact , the new far - infrared  data indicate a lower isrf than we have assumed , even for l1689b , where the isrf is generally considered to be enhanced . thus lower  are more likely than higher . since @xcite describe their results in terms of _ enhanced _ isrf , a word of explanation is in order .",
    "they use the isrf of @xcite , which is considerably lower than the black - draine field that we use ( cf . fig .",
    "2a ) in the mid - infrared  to far - infrared  region where they constrain the field .",
    "it seems that , for these cores at least , the correct value lies between the two standard choices for the isrf .",
    "the far - infrared  data strongly constrain the isrf because they are exponentially sensitive to in this regime ; future measurements and modeling will allow much better knowledge of the local isrf .",
    "we have modeled the emission from dust in pre - protostellar cores , including a self - consistent calculation of the temperature distribution ( ) for an input density distribution .",
    "we have also simulated the observations by convolving models with the observed beam and applying chopping to the models . using the calculated  has a substantial impact on the conclusions .",
    "compared to earlier studies that assumed a constant , our models indicate smaller regions of relatively constant density ( by factors of 0.5 to 0.9 ) and higher central densities ( by factors of 3 to 10 ) . indeed , for l1544 , a singular , power - law density distribution can not be ruled out .",
    "for the three sources we have modeled , there seems to be a sequence of increasing central condensation , from l1512 to l1689b to l1544 . while many more starless cores need to be modeled , it is possible that a new sequence of cores may be identified , in which increasing central condensation is the primary variable .",
    "the denser two of these cores , l1689b and l1544 , have spectroscopic evidence of contraction motions @xcite , while l1512 does not @xcite , consistent with this suggested sequence .",
    "it is interesting that bonnor - ebert spheres fit the data well , even though unstable spheres are needed in all cases .",
    "magnetic fields may allow these nominally unstable objects to persist , but in the absence of a suitable 2d/3d radiative transfer model we are not able to say whether or not the existing ambipolar diffusion controlled collapse models are consistent with the observations .    @xcite have also used bonnor - ebert spheres to fit their scuba data in the @xmath119 ophiuchus molecular cloud .",
    "they find smaller outer radii and smaller degrees of central condensation , but they have used models with constant @xmath120 .",
    "the smaller outer radii may reflect the crowded conditions and higher ambient pressures in the @xmath119 ophiuchus region , compared to the  elbow room \" available to the isolated cores in this study .",
    "more detailed analysis of the clustered regions , including calculations of , and more extensive studies of isolated regions will together delineate the differences in initial conditions for clustered and isolated star formation .",
