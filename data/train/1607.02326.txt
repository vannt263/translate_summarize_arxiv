    "pedestrian flow modelling has attracted the interest of a large number of scientists from different research fields , planners and designers . while planning the architecture of buildings one might be interested in how people move around their intended design so that shops , entrances , corridors , emergency exits and seating can be placed in useful locations .",
    "pedestrian models are helpful in improving efficiency and safety in public places such as airport terminals , train stations , theatres and shopping malls .",
    "they are not only used as a tool for understanding pedestrian dynamics at public places , but also support transportation planners or managers to design timetables .",
    "a large number of models for pedestrian flow have appeared on different levels of description in recent years .",
    "the microscopic ( individual - based ) level models based on newton type equations as well as vision - based models or cellular automata models have been developed , see refs . , and hydrodynamic pedestrian flow equations involving equation for density and mean velocity of the flow are derived in refs",
    "modeling of pedestrian flow with scalar conservation laws coupled to the solution of the eikonal equation has been presented and investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the modelling of pedestrian behaviour in a real - world environment is a complex problem , mainly due to the unpredictable nature of human decision making .",
    "literature @xcite shows for example , that , 70 @xmath0 of people in a crowd are moving in groups and social interactions which can greatly influence crowd behaviour .",
    "most of the models mentioned above treat pedestrians as individual agents and neglect the group dynamics among them .",
    "the influence of group dynamics on the behaviour of pedestrians , the differences between the behaviour of pedestrians walking with groups and those who walk alone , and the interpretation of passenger s social characteristics and group behaviour using a simulation model has been presented in several recent works .",
    "we refer to @xcite .    in this work , we closely follow a procedure for interacting particle systems used , for example , in the description of coherent motion of animal groups such as schools of fish , flocks of birds or swarms of insects , see ref .",
    "it has been applied to pedestrian flow modelling in ref .",
    "@xcite . there",
    ", a classical microscopic social force model for pedestrians has been extended with an optimal path computation as for example in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the main objective of the present paper is to include multi - group behaviour and the impact of group dynamics , addressing in particular larger groups in a pedestrian crowd , into the set - up developped in @xcite .",
    "we extend the model developed there to the description of multi - group pedestrian flows using a multi - phase approach .",
    "for the numerical simulations we use , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , particle methods on the microscopic and macroscopic level of the model hierarchy .",
    "these methods are straightforward for microscopic equations . in case of the macroscopic equations particle methods",
    "are based on a lagrangian formulation of these equations .",
    "the dependence of the solutions on the level of attraction between the group members and the relaxation time towards the desired optimal path field is investigated and discussed . as a general result",
    "we observe the increase in evacuation time either by increasing the attraction between the group members or by decreasing the relaxation time towards the velocity given by the eikonal equation .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in section 2 the hierarchy of multi - group pedestrian models is presented .",
    "section 3 contains a description of the particle methods used in the simulations .",
    "section 4 contains the numerical results .",
    "we consider an evacuation problem .",
    "a comparison of the solutions of the macroscopic equations is presented for different parameters together with a comparison of the assicated evacuation times .",
    "finally , section 5 concludes the work .",
    "in this section , we start with a multi - group microscopic model for pedestrian flow using a microscopic social force model and a hughes - type model including the solution of the eikonal equation .",
    "we proceed by deriving multi - group hydrodynamic and scalar models from the microscopic model .",
    "we consider a microscopic social force model for pedestrian flow including an optimal path computation . for references ,",
    "see for example refs . .",
    "for @xmath1 pedestrians divided into @xmath2 groups , we obtain a two - dimensional interacting particle system with locations @xmath3 , and velocity @xmath4 . here , the index @xmath5 is used to number all pedestrians , the index @xmath6 denotes the group to which the pedestrian belongs .",
    "@xmath7 denotes the set of all @xmath8 which are in group @xmath9 and @xmath10 denotes the number of pedestrians in group @xmath9 with @xmath11 .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an interaction potential denoting the interaction between members of groups @xmath9 and @xmath14 .",
    "a common choice is the morse potential @xmath15 here , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are attractive and repulsive strengths and @xmath18 , @xmath19 are their respective length scales .",
    "these constants depend on the groups @xmath9 and @xmath14 under consideration .",
    "an attractive interaction force acts only between members of the same group .",
    "the repulsive force acts between all pedestrians .",
    "the acceleration towards the desired direction is given by @xmath20 moreover , @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a smoothed version of the @xmath24-distribution with @xmath25 finally , @xmath26 is given by the solution of the eikonal equation @xmath27 @xmath28 is a density - dependent velocity function , @xmath29 , @xmath30 denotes a reaction time .",
    "moreover , we use the notation @xmath31 such that @xmath32 .    in @xcite",
    "an attractive interaction of the members of the group with the center of mass is postulated .",
    "this gives an additional term @xmath33 we define this attraction using the attractive part of a morse potential @xmath34 again , the constants might depend on the group @xmath9 .",
    "following @xcite one rescales the interaction potential of equation ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) with a factor @xmath35 and derives a kinetic mean field equation .",
    "this procedure is adapted to the multi - group case in the following .",
    "our scaled microscopic model states @xmath36    the empirical measures @xmath37 of the stochastic processes @xmath38 are given by @xmath39 where @xmath24 denotes the usual dirac distribution and @xmath40 .",
    "the mean field limit describes the convergence for @xmath41 of the empirical measure @xmath37 towards the deterministic distribution @xmath42 of the stochastic process @xmath43 governed by the so - called nonlinear mckean  vlasov equation @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the corresponding differential equation for the evolution of the distribution functions @xmath47 on state space , which is determined using it s formula , is called the mean field equation .",
    "it is given by @xmath48 with force term @xmath49 we note that due to our definitions we have @xmath50 for the following we define the momentum by @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "the additional term @xmath53 gives in the limit @xmath54 with @xmath55      hydrodynamic limits for interacting particle systems have been derived for example in @xcite .",
    "we consider the mean field equation ( [ eq:2.4 ] ) and integrate the kinetic equation against @xmath56 and @xmath57 . using a mono - kinetic distribution function to close the resulting balance equations means that the velocity distribution function is assumed to be concentrated in the direction of the mean velocity , @xmath58 integrating the mean field equation wrto @xmath56 one obtains the continuity equation for group @xmath9 @xmath59 integrating wrto @xmath60 yields the second balance equation for group @xmath9 @xmath61 using now the mono - kinetic closure function we obtain @xmath62 and @xmath63 thus , equation ( [ bal2 ] ) becomes the momentum equation @xmath64 with @xmath65 for @xmath52 and this is coupled to @xmath66      in this section , we reduce the hydrodynamic description deriving scalar models . we assume again an interaction potential depending only on @xmath67 .",
    "starting from the hydrodynamic momentum equation derived from the standard maxwellian closure we neglect time changes in this equation and obtain an equation for @xmath68 as @xmath69 using equation ( [ eq:2.7 ] ) , we get @xmath70 thus , the resulting scalar equation for @xmath71 is @xmath72   = 0,\\ ] ] for @xmath52 .",
    "a further simplification is obtained approximating the potential @xmath73 by a @xmath74 distribution , i.e. , @xmath75 with the constant @xmath76 given by @xmath77 this yields straightforwardly @xmath78 hence , equation ( [ eq:2.8 ] ) becomes a multi - group version of the hughes equations @xmath79 where @xmath52 .",
    "this is again combined with the eikonal equation @xmath80    [ discussion ] looking at equation ( [ eq:2.9 ] ) one observes that the influence of the diffusive term can be decreased in different ways .",
    "for example , adding or increasing the attraction interaction will decrease the value of @xmath81 . decreasing the value of the relaxation time @xmath30",
    "will also decrease the diffusion .",
    "moreover , from considering ( [ eq:2.9 ] ) together with a monotone decaying function @xmath28 one would expect an increase of the diffusion to lead to a decay of the maximal values of the density and then to a faster transport in the direction of the eikonal field .",
    "in this section , we discuss the numerical methods for the two multi - group models ( [ eq:2.5 ] ) , ( [ eq:2.6 ] ) and ( [ eq:2.8 ] ) .      to solve the hydrodynamic limit equations numerically we use a particle method , see , for example @xcite .",
    "mesh - less or particle methods are an appropriate way to solve pedestrian flow problems due to the appearance of situations with complicated geometries , free and moving boundaries and potentially large deformations of the domain of computation , i.e. the region where the density of pedestrians is non - zero .",
    "the particle method is based on a lagrangian formulation of hydrodynamic equations ( [ eq:2.5 ] ) and ( [ eq:2.6 ] ) .",
    "we consider @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "one evaluates these quantities at the particle locations and approximates the spatial derivatives of @xmath85 by a difference approximation .",
    "the simplest way to evaluate the integral over the interaction potential is to use a straightforward first order integration rule using an approximation of the local area around a particle determined by nearest neighbour search .",
    "this works fine for a well resolved situation with a sufficiently large number of gridpoints . in case",
    "the situation is underresolved we refer to @xcite for a thorough discussion of this issue .",
    "the resulting system of odes is then solved by a suitable time discretization method .",
    "diffusive terms can be included as well in a straightforward way .",
    "obviously , the above considerations show that the actual macroscopic computations are very similar to the microscopic ones if the number of macroscopic grid points is equal to the number of microscopic particles .",
    "however , in the macroscopic situation the particles are not physical particles as in the microscopic case .",
    "they play the role of discretization points .",
    "in particular , if the number of real particles is very large , that does not mean that the number of macroscopic particles in the particle method has to be increased in the same way . the number of macroscopic particles is only chosen according to accuracy considerations . in this sense ,",
    "the numerical methodology for the hydrodynamic equations ranges from a `` nearly '' microscopic `` solver to a purely macroscopic solver depending on the number of grid - particles involved in the computation compared to the ' ' real \" number of physical particles .",
    "we note that boundary conditions are realized by using fixed boundary particles with a suitable interaction potential .",
    "the scalar equation is solved with a similar particle method . in this case",
    "the so called diffusion velocity methods is used , i.e. , the equation ( [ eq:2.8 ] ) is written as a pure transport problem @xmath86 with @xmath87 and then solved in a lagrangian way .",
    "the approximation of the convolution term and the realization of the boundary conditions is done as for the hydrodynamic models .      in all cases",
    "the solution of the eikonal equation is coupled to the flow simulation .",
    "the eikonal equation is solved by a fast marching method , see ref .",
    "it is solved on the same point cloud as the fluid dynamic equations .",
    "we use a similar methodology as described in ref .",
    "@xcite to solve the eikonal equation on an unstructured fixed grid .",
    "we update the eikonal solution in every tenth time step in order to save computational time .",
    "in this section , we present a series of numerical experiments for different parameters in the multi - group hydrodynamic ( [ eq:2.5 ] ) , ( [ eq:2.6 ] ) and scalar ( [ eq:2.8 ] ) equations .",
    "we investigate the models numerically for a configuration defined in ref .",
    "consider a railway platform of @xmath88 length and @xmath89 width with a square obstacle in the middle .",
    "initially , pedestrians are concentrated in the left boundary .",
    "they can leave at either of the two exits of @xmath90 width on the right boundary .",
    "we use 570 grid points or grid particles to describe the initial configuration .",
    "the initial density in this region is @xmath91 .",
    "s , title=\"fig : \" ]    we consider two situations : a single and a multi - group pedestrian flow as shown in figure [ fig:1 ] . for the single group pedestrian model the interaction between the pedestrians",
    "is given by a purely repulsive interaction potential .",
    "the multi - group pedestrian model contains two kinds of pedestrian : 75 @xmath92 are individual pedestrians .",
    "they interact with a purely repulsive interaction term as in the single group model .",
    "the second group consists of the remaining 25 @xmath92 of the pedestrians . between the members of this group",
    "the interaction potential contains an additional attraction term .",
