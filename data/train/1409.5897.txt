    "however , because the near - ir fluxes of brown dwarfs collapse below @xmath11  k @xcite , space - based mid - ir telescopes offer the best sensitivity to y dwarfs .",
    "fortunately , two telescopes of this kind have been available in recent years , consisting of the _ spitzer space telescope _ @xcite and the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( _ wise _ , * ? ? ?",
    "_ spitzer _ imaging of fields surrounding nearby stars has uncovered a companion that is likely a y dwarf @xcite and the all - sky map from _ wise _ has found 19 free - floating objects that are confirmed or likely y dwarfs @xcite . following the initial mid - ir detections of y dwarfs by these satellites , further characterization of their spectral energy distributions is currently possible only through deep photometry or spectroscopy at near - ir wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the probable y dwarf discovered with _",
    "spitzer _ is a companion to the white dwarf wd  0806 - 661 .",
    "it has an estimated mass of 69  @xmath12 @xcite and a projected separation of @xmath13 , corresponding to 2500  au at the distance of the primary ( 19.2@xmath10.6  pc , * ? ? ?",
    "wd  0806 - 661  b has not been classified spectroscopically , but it is likely to have a y spectral type since it is less luminous than most confirmed y dwarfs @xcite .",
    "in addition to being one of the coldest known brown dwarfs ( @xmath0345  k , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , wd  0806 - 661  b was the first y dwarf with an accurate distance because of its companionship to a star with a previously measured parallax , and it is the only y dwarf with a well - constrained age because its primary is a white dwarf . as a result , it represents a unique benchmark for testing atmospheric and evolutionary models of substellar objects at very low temperatures .",
    "however , because of its large distance compared to other known y dwarfs , wd  0806 - 661  b is particularly faint and few data are available for comparison to models ; it has been detected in only the 3.6 and 4.5  bands of _ spitzer _ to date and has a rather faint limit on its near - ir flux ( @xmath14 , * ? ? ?",
    "in pursuit of the first near - ir detection of wd  0806 - 661  b , we have obtained images of it with the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on board the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , which is the most sensitive near - ir camera that is currently available .",
    "we have also analyzed archival images of wd  0806 - 661  b from the very large telescope ( vlt ) . in this paper",
    ", we describe the collection and reduction of these data ( section  [ sec : obs ] ) and use the reduced images to constrain the binarity of wd  0806 - 661  b , refine the empirical sequence of y dwarfs in a color - magnitude diagram , and test models of brown dwarfs ( section  [ sec : analysis ] ) .",
    "we conclude by placing our near - ir data for wd  0806 - 661  b in the context of other known y dwarfs and discussing additional observations that would further constrain the models ( section  [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "we obtained images of wd  0806 - 661  b with the ir channel of wfc3 @xcite on 2013 february 8 and 9 ( ut ) .",
    "the camera contains a @xmath15 hgcdte array in which the pixels have dimensions of @xmath16 .",
    "the inner @xmath17 portion of the array detects light , which corresponds to a field of view of @xmath18 .",
    "we selected the f110w filter for these observations because it appeared to offer the best sensitivity to cold brown dwarfs among the available wfc3 filters based on simulations with the instrument s exposure time calculator using spectra of late t dwarfs .",
    "this filter spans from @xmath191.4  , corresponding roughly to the sum of the @xmath20 and @xmath5 filters .",
    "the observations were performed during three identical two - orbit visits . in a given orbit ,",
    "one 1003  s exposure was collected at each position in a three - point dither pattern .",
    "the dither patterns in the two orbits in each visit were offset by 3.5 pixels along the x - axis of the array .",
    "the 18 wfc3 images were registered and combined using the tasks _ tweakreg _ and _ astrodrizzle _ within the drizzlepac software package .",
    "we adopted a drop size of 0.85 native pixels and a resampled plate scale of @xmath21  pixel@xmath22 .",
    "point sources in the reduced image exhibit fwhm@xmath23 .",
    "we aligned the world coordinate system of the wfc3 image to that of the irac images from @xcite using offsets in right ascension , declination , and rotation that were derived from sources detected by both wfc3 and irac . in figure  [ fig : image ] , we present a small portion of the wfc3 image surrounding the positions of wd  0806 - 661  b in the irac images , which were taken in 2004 and 2009 .",
    "we have estimated the location of wd  0806 - 661  b on the date of the wfc3 observation by combining the astrometry from irac with the proper motion and parallax of the primary @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : image ] , a source is detected in the wfc3 image at @xmath24  @xmath25 from the expected position , which we take to be wd  0806 - 661  b.    aperture photometry was measured for wd  0806 - 661  b using an aperture radius of @xmath26 and radii of @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the inner and outer boundaries of the sky annulus , respectively .",
    "we converted that measurement to an aperture radius of @xmath28 using an aperture correction of 0.097  mag , which was estimated from well - detected , isolated stars in the image .",
    "we then applied the zero - point vega magnitude for f110w for an aperture radius of @xmath28 , which is 25.8829 .",
    "the resulting f110w photometry is given in table  [ tab : data ] .      to further constrain the spectral energy distribution of wd  0806 - 661  b ,",
    "we have made use of unpublished images in the @xmath29 and @xmath20 bands that are publicly available in the data archive of the vlt .",
    "the @xmath29-band images were collected with the focal reducer / low dispersion spectrograph 2 @xcite on the vlt unit telescope 1 on the night of 2012 march 30 ( p. delorme , i d 089.c-0597 ) .",
    "the camera contains two 2048@xmath304096 ccds .",
    "the observations were performed with the standard resolution collimator and 2@xmath302 binning , which produced a plate scale of @xmath31 pixel@xmath22 .",
    "wd  0606 - 661  b was placed within one array and 38 dithered images were taken , each with an exposure time of 120  s. we bias subtracted and flat fielded the individual frames , and registered and combined them into a single mosaic .",
    "the fwhm of point sources in the combined image was @xmath32 .",
    "the image was flux calibrated using photometry in @xmath29(ab ) for a calibration star , g138 - 31 , from the ninth data release of the sloan digital sky survey photometric catalog @xcite combined with a conversion from @xmath29(ab ) to @xmath29(vega ) .    the @xmath20-band images were obtained with the high acuity wide - field k - band imager @xcite on the vlt unit telescope 4 on the night of 2012 may 21 ( m. burleigh , i d 089.c-0428 ) . the camera contains four 2048@xmath302048 hgcdte arrays and has a plate scale of @xmath33 pixel@xmath22 .",
    "wd  0806 - 661  b was placed within one of the four arrays and 28 dithered images were taken , each consisting of 26 coadded 2  s exposures .",
    "following dark subtraction and flat fielding , the images were registered and combined .",
    "point sources in the combined image had fwhm@xmath34 .",
    "stars in the observed field exhibited significant flux variations ( @xmath350.4  mag ) among the dithered frames , indicating that the conditions were not photometric and that the photometric standard star probably would not provide an accurate flux calibration . for stars appearing in our @xmath29 and f110w images and the previous @xmath5-band images from @xcite ,",
    "the median values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 differ by @xmath38  mag ; the difference in the medians of @xmath39 and @xmath37 should be even smaller because of the smaller wavelength range spanned .",
    "therefore , we performed a rough calibration of the @xmath20-band image by requiring that @xmath39 and @xmath37 have the same medians .",
    "we find that wd  0806 - 661  b is not detected in the @xmath29 and @xmath20 images .",
    "the magnitude limits that correspond to a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of 3 are provided in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "we searched for binary companions to wd  0806 - 661  b in the drizzle - combined f110w image through a point source function ( psf ) fitting algorithm .",
    "an empirical psf was constructed by median - combining normalized and background - subtracted @xmath40 subimages of 96 high s / n ( @xmath4150 ) , unsaturated , normalized point sources in the drizzled frame .",
    "this psf may not precisely represent those of wd  0806 - 661  b or a cooler companion due to the significantly different spectral energy distributions of the field stars ; however , this is our best option given the necessity of using the drizzle - combined image .",
    "an alternate method , using tiny tim psf models @xcite , is also not feasible as this code is currently not set up for subsampled wfc3 images .",
    "we fit both single and binary psf models to a comparably - sized subimage centered on wd  0806 - 661  b using a monte carlo markov chain algorithm with @xmath42 evaluation to determine the optimal primary and secondary @xmath43 and @xmath44 pixel positions and fluxes .",
    "the binary model failed to provide a significantly better fit ( @xmath4190% confidence ) to the data based on an f - test analysis , so we rule out detection of a companion .",
    "we assessed our sensitivity limit by performing an identical series of binary fits to 10,000 simulated subimages with companion psfs implanted , sampling @xmath45 , separations of 1 to 8.5 pixels ( @xmath21@xmath46 ) and all position angles .",
    "fits were deemed successful if the recovered companion had a separation and relative magnitude within 0.5  pixels and 0.3  mag of the input parameters . figure  [ fig : bin ] displays the 20% , 50% and 80% recovery limits as a function of separation and relative magnitude ( @xmath47 ) . beyond @xmath48 ,",
    "the 50% ( 80% ) limit is @xmath49  mag ( @xmath50  mag ) , which corresponds to @xmath51t@xmath52  k based on the models of brown dwarfs described in section  [ sec : models ] .",
    "these limits were verified by visual examination of the implanted companions .        for comparison to the data for wd  0806 - 661  b , we have considered four sets of models for the spectral energy distributions of y dwarfs that are characterized primarily by the following features : water clouds and chemical equilibrium @xcite , cloudless and chemical equilibrium @xcite , cloudless and non - equilibrium chemistry @xcite , and 50% coverage of water , chloride , and sulfide clouds and chemical equilibrium @xcite .",
    "these models have been previously compared to color - magnitude diagrams of late t and y dwarfs , the results of which can be summarized as follows : @xmath53 is better matched by the cloudless models while the cloudy models predict colors that are too red @xcite .",
    "the opposite is true for @xmath54 , which is reproduced by the cloudy models of @xcite while the cloudless model colors are too blue @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath55 predicted by both cloudy and cloudless models are too blue , possibly because of incomplete methane line lists @xcite .",
    "the mid - ir bands that have been considered consist of the 3.4 , 4.6 , and 12  bands from _ wise _ ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 ) and the 3.6 and 4.5  bands from _ spitzer _ ( [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] ) . both the cloudy and cloudless models are roughly consistent with previous data for y dwarfs in color - magnitude diagrams composed of [ 4.5 ] or @xmath57 and colors spanning from those bands to @xmath5 , @xmath59 , and @xmath58 @xcite , although the large scatter in the data precludes discrimination between the models .",
    "finally , both sets of model colors are too red in color - magnitude diagrams involving @xmath60-[4.5]$ ] @xcite .      the previous photometry and",
    "our new measurements for wd  0806 - 661  b are compiled in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "we wish to use our new data to test the models of y dwarfs described in the previous section . before doing so",
    ", we would like to convert @xmath61 to @xmath5 since it is more widely available for other y dwarfs and is encompassed by the f110w filter . to perform this conversion , we have computed @xmath37 from observed and model spectra of cold brown dwarfs using the transmission profiles of f110w and @xmath5 on the mauna kea observatories near - infrared system @xcite . for the observed spectra",
    ", we have considered the published spectra of dwarfs later than t8 that fully span the wavelength range of f110w and that have the highest s / n , which corresponds to the data for ugps j072227.51 - 054031.2 ( t9 ) , wisepc j014807.25 - 720258.8 ( t9.5 ) , and wisep j154151.65 - 225025.2 ( y0.5 ) from @xcite .",
    "these spectra exhibit @xmath62 , 0.87 , and 0.65 , respectively .",
    "meanwhile , the models that are near the value of @xmath6 for wd  0806 - 661  b ( similar to that of wisep j154151.65 - 225025.2 ) produce @xmath37 colors of 1.2 @xcite , 0.66 ( chemical equilibrium ) and 0.81 ( non - equilibrium ) @xcite , and 0.75 @xcite .",
    "we ignore the color from @xcite since it is significantly redder than the data for t / y dwarfs ( a similar difference is present in @xmath53 , * ? ? ?",
    "the remaining model colors are roughly similar to the observed values .",
    "these observed and model colors suggest that wd  0806 - 661  b probably has @xmath63 , which implies @xmath4 when combined with our measurement of @xmath61 .",
    "we can derive new constraints on the colors of wd  0806 - 661  b by combining our estimate of @xmath5 , the limits on @xmath29 and @xmath20 , and the existing photometry in [ 4.5 ] .",

    "wd  0806 - 661  b does not appear to be overluminous in either color - magnitude diagram , indicating that it is probably not an unresolved binary in which the components have similar fluxes .    in figures  [ fig : p1 ] and [ fig",
    ": p2 ] , the y dwarf isochrones at 1 and 3  gyr from @xcite differ only modestly ; the isochrones for these ages are quite similar to each other for each of the remaining three sets of models . because the model isochrones do not vary significantly with age , we can compare them to both wd  0806 - 661  b and the y dwarf population as a whole . in @xmath6 versus @xmath7 $ ] , the cloudy models of @xcite and the cloudless models of @xcite agree fairly well with wd  0806 - 661  b and the y dwarf sequence .",
    "the cloudy models of @xcite are slightly bluer than those data at fainter magnitudes , and the non - equilibrium models of @xcite are bluer still . in @xmath6 versus @xmath60-[4.5]$ ] , all of the models are significantly redder than the data , which has been noticed previously for t and y dwarfs @xcite .",
    "given that the models resemble the data in @xmath6 versus @xmath7 $ ] but not @xmath6 versus @xmath60-[4.5]$ ] , this discrepancy may be primarily due to errors in the predicted 3.6  fluxes , although near- and mid - ir spectroscopy are needed for a definitive conclusion .",
