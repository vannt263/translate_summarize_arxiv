    "the evolution of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) can be significantly affected by feedback effects from galaxies .",
    "supernovae and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) can deposit large amounts of energy into the surrounding interstellar gas , accelerating it to large velocities .",
    "if the gas becomes unbound , a galactic wind , or outflow , will result , with important consequences for the evolution of the igm .",
    "galactic outflows deposit energy , momentum , and metal - enriched gas into the igm .",
    "this can affect the subsequent formation of other galaxies , by striping the gas from collapsing halos , reheating and possibly ionizing the igm , and modifying its cooling rate through metal enrichment .",
    "these metals have been observed via the lyman-@xmath14 forest ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "feedback from galactic outflows have been invoked to explain several observations at the galaxy scale , such as the high mass - to - light ratio of dwarf galaxies , the overcooling problem , and the size of the galactic discs ( the angular momentum problem ) . at larger scales",
    ", feedback is needed to explain the observed metallicity and entropy content of the igm , and the scaling relations for clusters .",
    "sne - driven outflows and agn - driven outflows are complementary .",
    "the number of sne increases with galactic mass , but the depth of the potential well that the gas must climb to escape also increases with galactic mass .",
    "hence , outflows produced by high - mass galaxies are not much larger than outflows produced by dwarf galaxies , and since these dwarf galaxies are much more numerous than high - mass ones , they account for most of the igm enrichment due to sne .",
    "agn - driven outflows are produced by massive galaxies , because these galaxies are the ones that harbor agns . in this paper",
    ", we focus on sne - driven outflows .",
    "agn - driven outflows are presented in two separate papers @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations and observations reveal that galactic outflows tend to be highly anisotropic .",
    "several authors have performed sph simulations of explosions inside isolated galaxies @xcite , or inside protogalaxies embeded in larger cosmological structures @xcite .",
    "these simulations reveal that outflows tend to be bipolar , with the energy and metal - enriched gas being channeled along the direction of least resistance .",
    "these results are supported by many observations that suggest that outflows are anisotropic and even bipolar ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there is also indirect support for anisotropic outflows from observations of metal enrichment at high redshift : metals are found in average - density regions far from known galaxies and a substantial scatter in metallicity is seen , which does not seem to be purely a consequence of density or galaxy proximity @xcite .",
    "anisotropic outflows travel larger distances than isotropic ones , and can more easily reach some low - density regions , while leaving others effectively pristine .",
    "several numerical studies of the impact of galactic outflows on the evolution of the igm have been performed .",
    "the different approaches used fall into three categories .",
    "the first approach consists of describing the growth of large - scale structure and the formation of galaxies in the universe using either an n - body simulation or a semi - analytical method ( e.g. @xcite , hereafter sb01 , @xcite ) , and to combine it with an analytical model for describing the evolution of the outflow @xcite .",
    "the model used assumes that outflows remain isotropic as they propagate through the igm and the surrounding structures .",
    "the second approach uses a smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) algorithm to simulate both the formation of large - scale structure and galaxies and the outflows themselves .",
    "outflows are generated by either depositing additional thermal energy into sph particles at the location of galaxies , to represent the energy generated by sne ( e.g. @xcite ) , or by creating a shell of sph particles around galaxies , and giving to these particles a large outward velocity component ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "outflows that start isotropic will become anisotropic as they propagate into a non - uniform external medium around galaxies .",
    "however , unlike the analytical outflow model used in the first approach , sph simulations have a limited resolution .",
    "if the anisotropy of the outflow is not caused by the density distribution around the galaxies , but instead by the structure of the galaxies , the simulations will not be able to resolve it properly .",
    "the third approach consists of identifying galaxies in an output from an sph simulation and calculating the propagation of outflows from these galaxies in @xmath15 different directions @xcite .",
    "since the resistance encountered by the outflows will be direction - dependent , outflows will start isotropic but then become anisotropic as the distance traveled by outflows will vary with direction . in this approach ,",
    "the matter located in the outflow slows down , but keeps expanding radially , while in the second approach described above , the matter located in outflows can be redirected in a different direction when it encounters resistance .",
    "but the most important limitation of this third approach is that it ignores the potential effect of feedback on the formation of galaxies , since the outflows are introduced _ a posteriori _ into an already completed sph simulation .    to study anisotropic outflows in a cosmological context , _ including the effect of feedback",
    "_ , we have returned to the first approach .",
    "the analytical model used in these studies for describing the outflows do not suffer from limited resolution , but assume isotropy .",
    "in a previous paper ( @xcite , hereafter paper  i ) , we presented a modified version of the outflow model , designed to describe the evolution of anisotropic outflows .",
    "we then combined this model with the analytical monte - carlo method of sb01 .",
    "we used a filtered gaussian density field to determine the location , mass , and collapse redshift of galaxies .",
    "galaxies produce anisotropic outflows that propagate along the direction of least resistance .",
    "when an outflow hits a region destined to collapse by @xmath16 , it either strips it of its gas , preventing the formation of a galaxy , or else enriches it in metals , potentially changing its cooling rate and the time necessary to turn it into a galaxy .",
    "we found that the anisotropy significantly enhanced the metal enrichment of average - to - low - density regions , as outflow tend to propagate into low - density regions , away from the cosmological structures ( pancakes and filaments ) where galaxies reside .    the monte carlo approach used in paper  i provides a simple description of the formation and growth of structures in the universe , but it has a few drawbacks .",
    "first , the mass spectrum of halos is discrete , with only 10 different masses being allowed .",
    "second , the peculiar velocity of halos is ignored ; halos form at the comoving location of density peaks , and remain there throughout the course of the simulation .",
    "hence , the clustering of halos and its potential consequences are poorly described .",
    "third , the movement and accretion of gas on large - scales is ignored .",
    "fourth , the treatment of halo destruction by mergers is quite simplistic . to address these four issues ,",
    "we replace the semi - analytical approach of paper  i by a full n - body simulation of structure formation .",
    "this paper is set out as follows . in  2 , we describe our numerical method and analytic outflow algorithm .",
    "results are presented in  3 , with and without photoionization suppression of galaxy formation .",
    "implications are discussed in  4 and conclusions are presented in  5 .",
    "we perform a numerical simulation of dark matter structure on cosmological scales by considering a @xmath1cdm model with present density parameter @xmath17 , baryon density parameter @xmath18 , cosmological constant @xmath19 , hubble constant @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , primordial tilt @xmath22 , and cmb temperature @xmath23 , consistent with the results of _ wmap3 _ @xcite .",
    "we simulate structure formation inside a comoving cubic volume of size @xmath24 , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the simulation was performed with a particle - particle / particle - mesh algorithm @xcite , using @xmath25 equal - mass particles and a @xmath26 grid .",
    "the total mass in the computational volume is @xmath27 , and the mass per particle is @xmath28 .",
    "the length resolution is @xmath29 comoving .",
    "the simulation produces dumps containing the positions and velocities of the particles .",
    "the dumps are regularly spaced in time by a time interval @xmath30 , which gives 131  dumps between redshifts @xmath2 and @xmath16 . in each dump , we identify halos using the friends - of - friends algorithm @xcite , with a linking length equal to 0.2 times the mean particle spacing . as in paper",
    "i , we set the minimum mass of halos at @xmath31 , corresponding to 34 particles .",
    "as we found in paper i and @xcite , halos below this mass do not form galaxies with mature stellar populations either because of long cooling times or photoionization heating .",
    "we do not consider the impact of mini - halos or population iii stars here , we assume that it is negligible aside from pre - enriching halos to a level where mature stellar populations can arise .    by combining the catalogs of halos",
    ", we can find the ancestry of each halo .",
    "consider a particular halo @xmath32 found in dump @xmath33 .",
    "we identify the particles contained in this halo , and then examine the previous dump , @xmath34 , to find where these particles were .",
    "if 50% or more of the particles located in a halo @xmath35 in dump @xmath34 end up in halo @xmath32 in dump @xmath33 , then halo @xmath35 is considered to be a _ progenitor _ of halo @xmath32 .",
    "then , we have three possibilities , depending on the number of progenitors :    * case a : halo @xmath32 has no progenitor .",
    "this halo was formed by the monolithic collapse of a region containing field particles , clumps ( halos containing fewer than 34 particles ) , or pieces extracted from other halos that amounted to less than 50% of those halos . in this case",
    ", we consider that a new halo is born , the birth redshift being the redshift corresponding to dump  @xmath33 .",
    "halo @xmath32 is a `` leaf '' in a merger tree . *",
    "case b : halo @xmath32 has one progenitor . in this case , the halo already existed in dump @xmath34 . between the two dumps ,",
    "it might have grown by accretion of field particles or small clumps , or might have lost mass by evaporation .",
    "* case c : halo @xmath32 has several progenitors . in this case , the merger of the progenitors have formed a new halo , and the progenitors no longer exist .",
    "there is an exception : if one progenitor , say halo @xmath36 , provides 90% or more of the mass of halo @xmath32 , we do not consider this to be a merger .",
    "halos @xmath36 and @xmath32 are actually the same halo , which grew by _ accreting _ ( not merging with ) smaller halos . in this case ,",
    "halo @xmath32 is not treated as a new halo , but as a preexisting one .",
    "figure  [ merger_schem ] illustrates the various cases .",
    "halo b , which had no progenitor , formed by monolithic collapse ( also , halo d , and halo a in dump @xmath37 ) .",
    "halo a grows by accretion between dumps @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "halo c formed by the merger of halos a and b. halo d is accreted onto halo c. this is not regarded as a merger because 90% or more of the mass of halo c in dump @xmath33 came from one single progenitor .",
    "once a halo has formed , if its gas is not being kept hot by the uv background , it will lose energy by radiative cooling .",
    "we implement this photoionization heating in manner described by the fiducial approach of @xcite .",
    "this is manifest in the simulation as a redshift - dependent minimum halo mass for gas cooling using the mass for which half the halo gas is expected to cool ( taken from @xcite ) .",
    "this corresponds to a halo circular velocity of @xmath39 { \\rm km\\,s^{-1 } } , \\label{eqv1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the collapse redshift of the halo .",
    "we conservatively apply this criterion by requiring that halos must have reached turnaround after @xmath41 for suppression of cooling to occur .",
    "we investigate the impact of photoionization heating in  [ results ] by showing results , first without , then with this criterion .    where photoionization suppression does not occur",
    ", halo gas cools resulting in galaxy formation and outflow production .",
    "as in sb01 and paper  i , we calculate the virial temperature of each halo from its mass and collapse redshift using the method of @xcite , and then we calculate the cooling time using the cooling model of @xcite .",
    "we assume that the halo turns into a galaxy after the cooling time has elapsed . as it turns out , for the range of halo masses and collapse redshifts considered in our simulations , the cooling times are almost always very long or very short , that is , either longer than the age of the universe or shorter than the time interval @xmath30 between dumps .. ] hence , most collapsed halos either become galaxies almost immediately , or never become galaxies .",
    "we assume that once a galaxy has formed , the outflow starts immediately .",
    "this is a valid assumption , since the lifespan of the progenitors of type  ii sne are short compared to the time resolution of our simulations .",
    "mergers and accretion of halos onto more massive halos bring an end to the fueling of outflows from hosted galaxies , since these galaxies no longer exist as independent systems .",
    "the effect is to revert any outflows into a post - supernova phase ( see the following section ) and begin the process of describing the properties of the new merged galaxy as a source of outflow fueling .",
    "to determine the direction of least resistance out of a halo , we first determine the orientations and lengths of the semimajor axes of the halo , using the standard method described by @xcite .",
    "we calculate the quadrupole tensor @xmath42 of the halo , @xmath43    where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the mass of particle @xmath46 and its position relative to the center of mass , respectively .",
    "we then diagonalize this tensor .",
    "the semimajor axes @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 of the halo are related to the eigenvalues @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the mass of the halo , and the eigenvectors give us the direction of these axes .",
    "we then take the direction of least resistance as being along the shortest axis .",
    "we have to make sure that the number of particles per halo is sufficient for this method to work . in paper",
    "i , the smallest halos we considered had a mass of @xmath55 . here a halo of such mass would be made of 34 particles , which is sufficient to determine the direction of the shortest axis .",
    "figure  [ lessres ] shows a region of size @xmath56 and thickness @xmath57 at redshift @xmath58 in the computational volume .",
    "we focus on a region containing a large - scale cosmological filament .",
    "the red dots represent the @xmath59 particles , the black dots indicate the positions of clusters identified by the friend - of - friend algorithm , and the bars indicate the direction of least resistance .",
    "these bars have equal length _ in 3d _ , but since they are seen in projection , they appear to have different lengths .",
    "there is clearly an overall tendency of the directions of least resistance to be aligned with each other , and to be perpendicular to the filament .",
    "outflows propagating along these directions will transport energy and metal - enriched gas preferentially in low - density regions .     and thickness @xmath57 centered on a large - scale filament , at redshift @xmath58 .",
    "red dots : @xmath59 particles ; black dots : halos .",
    "the lines indicate the directions of least resistance . ]",
    "the dynamical equations describing the evolution of the outflows are presented in full detail in paper  i. they are based on the original treatment of @xcite , sbo1 , and @xcite , and have been generalized to the case of anisotropic outflows . here",
    "we present a review of the method .",
    "the injection of thermal energy by sne produces an outflow of radius @xmath60 , which consists of a dense shell of thickness @xmath61 containing a cavity .",
    "a fraction @xmath62 , of the gas is piled up in the shell , while a fraction , @xmath63 , of the gas is distributed inside the cavity .",
    "we normally assume that most of the gas is located inside a thin shell ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) .",
    "this is called the _ thin - shell approximation_.    the evolution of an outflow of radius @xmath60 and opening angle @xmath14 expanding out of a halo of mass @xmath54 is described by the following system of equations , @xmath66}-{5\\dot rp\\over r}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where a dot represents a time derivative , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 are the total density parameter , baryon density parameter , and hubble parameter at time , @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "@xmath71 is the luminosity ( see below ) , @xmath72 is the thermal pressure resulting from this luminosity , and @xmath73 is the external pressure of the igm .",
    "@xmath14 is the opening angle of the outflow , which is @xmath8 for isotropic outflows .",
    "the external pressure @xmath73 depends upon the density and temperature of the igm . as in paper  i , we assume a photoheated igm made of ionized hydrogen and singly - ionized helium , with a fixed temperature @xmath74 @xcite , and an igm density @xmath75 equal to the mean baryon density , @xmath76 . the external pressure is then given by @xmath77    where @xmath78 is the redshift and @xmath79 is the mean molecular mass .",
    "the luminosity @xmath71 is the rate of energy deposition or dissipation within the outflow , and is given by @xmath80    where @xmath81 is the total luminosity of the supernovae responsible for generating the outflow , and @xmath82 represents cooling due to compton drag against cmb photons ( other contributions are neglected , as in paper  i ) .",
    "the supernovae luminosity , for a galaxy forming in a halo of mass @xmath54 , is given by @xmath83    where @xmath84 is the star formation efficiency , @xmath85 is the total mass in stars formed during the starburst , @xmath86 is the fraction of the total energy released that goes into the outflow , @xmath87 is the mass of stars required to form one sn , and @xmath88 is the energy released by each of these sne . as in paper",
    "i , we take the values @xmath89 , @xmath90 ( derived using a broken power - law imf from @xcite ) , and the mass - dependent expression for @xmath86 given by @xcite .",
    "the compton luminosity for a mixture of ionized hydrogen and singly - ionized helium is given by @xmath91    where @xmath92 is the thompson cross section , and @xmath93 is the present cmb temperature .",
    "we used @xmath94 , which is valid over the range of redshifts we consider .",
    "the expansion of the outflow is initially driven by the supernovae luminosity . after a time @xmath95 , the supernovae turn off , and the outflow enters the `` post - supernova phase . ''",
    "the pressure inside the outflow keeps driving the expansion , but this pressure drops since there is no energy input from supernovae .",
    "eventually , the pressure will drop down to the level of the external igm pressure .",
    "at that point , we assume that the expansion of the outflow will simply follow hubble expansion .",
    "as outflows propagate into the igm , the expanding shells of swept - up gas may eventually hit halos . following sb01 and paper  i , we assume that if an already formed galaxy is hit by an outflow , the cross section is too small for the impact to have any significant effect . if a halo that has not yet collapsed and formed a galaxy is hit , two things might happen .",
    "either the ram pressure of the outflow will strip the halo of its baryonic content , preventing the formation of a galaxy , or else the halo will be enriched in metals by the outflow .",
    "the condition for stripping is @xmath96    where @xmath97 and @xmath60 the mass and radius of the shell , respectively , @xmath98 is the outflow velocity , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the radius and baryonic mass of the halo being hit , and @xmath101 is the escape velocity from the halo . in paper  i , we used the spherical collapse model to estimate the radius @xmath99 at the time of the hit .",
    "this model predicts that halos expand , eventually turn around , and collapse to a point .",
    "this was straight forward in the monte carlo approach of paper  i. however , in the numerical approach used in this paper , we identify collapsed halos using the friend - of - friend algorithm , and these halos obviously have a finite size .",
    "thus , the basic spherical model needs to be modified to account for the fact that real halos do not collapse down to a point , but instead contract by a factor of order 2 after turnaround , and reach virial equilibrium .",
    "we describe our modified spherical collapse model in appendix  b.    when the criterion for stripping is met , the halo is labeled as being stripped , and it will not form a galaxy . if the halo is not stripped , the outflow will deposit metals into the halo .",
    "we assume that halos start with metallicity of @xmath102=-3 $ ] , which is negligible for the purposes of calculating the halo cooling time .",
    "once galaxies are formed , metals are produced at rate of @xmath103 per sn @xcite .",
    "hence the mass of metals in the outflow is @xmath104    where @xmath105 is the fraction of ism gas blown out with the outflow .",
    "we use the value @xmath106 taken from the numerical simulations of @xcite .",
    "this mass of metals is distributed evenly throughout the volume of the outflow .",
    "when an outflow strikes a halo and does not strip it , it modifies the metal content of the halo by depositing a fraction of its metals , @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is a mass deposition efficiency , which we set at @xmath109 , and @xmath110 is the volume of the outflow that overlaps with the halo . for details ,",
    "we refer the reader to paper  i.    the radiative cooling rate increases with metallicity .",
    "so when a halo is enriched by metals , we recompute its cooling time , which determines when this halo will form a galaxy .",
    "this is the potential to `` bring to life '' dead halos . a halo that can not become a galaxy because its cooling time exceeds the age of the universe might form a galaxy after all , if metal enrichment reduces the cooling time .",
    "it turns out to be a rare occurrence . in all the simulations we performed only several galaxies",
    "were formed this way , out of @xmath3 galaxies .",
    "stellar evolution in galaxies produces metals , that are then carried into the igm by outflows .",
    "of particular interest is the _ volume filling factor _ , that is , the fraction of the igm , by volume , that has been enriched in metals by outflows . to calculate the volume filling factor , we can not simply add up the final volumes of the outflows , and divide by the volume of the computational box .",
    "intergalactic gas enriched by outflows will move with time as structures grow , and therefore regions that were never hit by outflows might end up containing metals .",
    "we take this effect into account , by using a dynamic particle enrichment scheme that was developed by @xcite . by combining the dumps produced by the @xmath111 code , which contains the position of the particles , with the positions , orientations , and radii of the outflows , we can find which particles are being hit by outflows , and at what redshift . we can then use a smoothed particle hydrodynamics technique to estimate the volume filling factor at any redshift . a smoothing length @xmath112 is ascribed to each particle .",
    "we calculate @xmath112 iteratively by requiring that each particle has between @xmath113 and @xmath114 neighbors within a distance @xmath115 .",
    "we then treat each particle as an extended sphere of radius @xmath115 over which it is considered to be spread .",
    "we then divide the computational volume into @xmath116 cubic cells .",
    "the cells that are covered by one or more enriched particles are then considered enriched .",
    "notice that simply counting the number of enriched particles in each cell would fail in low - density regions , where the local particle spacing exceeds the cell size    additionally , giving a smoothing length to each @xmath111 particle enables us to easily calculate the gas density in the center of each cell , using the standard sph equation , @xmath117    where @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 are the position , mass , and smoothing length of particle @xmath121 , @xmath122 is the position of a grid point , and @xmath123 is the smoothing kernel ( see @xcite for a detailed description of sph ) .",
    "we will use this in ",
    "3.2 below .",
    "we performed a series of ten simulations : five with our galaxy formation scheme excluding suppression by photoionization heating , to produce results that can be compared with our results in paper i , and a further five with this suppression as used in @xcite . in each case",
    "we simulate outflows with opening angles @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "this latter case corresponds to isotropic outflows .",
    "figure  [ filling_nr ] shows the evolution of the volume filling factor for the five opening angles considered .",
    "enrichment starts at redshift @xmath124 when the first galaxies form , and steadily increase with time , to reach @xmath125 by redshift @xmath16",
    ". the fraction increases with decreasing angle , at all redshifts .",
    "this differs from the results of paper i , and clearly shows the importance of an accurate description of clustering . in paper",
    "i , we found that the fraction was nearly constant , near 14% , for angles between @xmath126 and @xmath127 , and then dropped down to @xmath128 at @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "8 , bottom left panel , in paper  i ) .",
    "three distinct effects determined the overall volume filling factor in paper i. these effects are still present here but their relative impact is changed .",
    "first , outflows are much more likely to overlap when the sources are highly clustered and this effect is diminished where outflows are anisotropic and aligned .",
    "second , clustering makes it more likely that an expanding outflow will hit a pre - galactic collapsing halo , possibly resulting in gas stripping and preventing a galaxy from forming and producing its own outflow .",
    "again the impact of this effect is diminished where outflows are anisotropic .",
    "third , the volume of each outflow decreases with decreasing angle , the increase in radius not being enough to compensate for the smaller angle .",
    "the first two effects tend to increase the volume filling factor for anisotropic outflows and are sensitive to the level of galaxy clustering .",
    "the third effect tends to decrease the overall volume filling factor and is insensitive to the degree of clustering . our results here show a more accurate and stronger degree of halo clustering , thus explaining the more marked impact of the first two effects with respect to the third .",
    "this also explains the small fractions we obtain in the isotropic case here ( @xmath129 at @xmath16 ) by comparison to the equivalent result in paper i.    rccrrc @xmath130 & 0.388 & 0.277 & @xmath131 & @xmath132 & @xmath133 @xmath134 & 0.381 & 0.206 & @xmath135 & @xmath136 & @xmath137 @xmath138 & 0.369 & 0.155 & @xmath139 & @xmath140 & @xmath141 @xmath142 & 0.367 & 0.109 & @xmath143 & @xmath144 & @xmath145 @xmath146 & 0.369 & 0.081 & @xmath147 & @xmath148 & @xmath149 [ tabfilling_nore ]    in table  [ tabfilling_nore ] , we list , for each opening angle , the total volume of the outflows , @xmath150 ( sum of all the volumes , ignoring overlap , in units of the box volume ) , the volume filling factor ( v.f.f . ) the number of halos hit and stripped ( @xmath151 , @xmath152 , respectively ) , and the number of outflows , @xmath153 , all at @xmath16 . comparing @xmath154 with v.f.f . in table",
    "[ tabfilling_nore ] , we clearly see that the effect of overlap is mild for small opening angles , but becomes very important for large ones . as the opening angle increases , there are more halos hit , more halos stripped , and as a result fewer galaxies are formed , producing fewer outflows .",
    "going from @xmath4 to @xmath126 , the number of outflows drops by a factor of 2 . despite this ,",
    "though , their total volumes are comparable ( 0.388 vs. 0.369 ) since the volume per outflow is greater for outflows with larger opening angles .",
    "in addition to the three effects described above we are also able to consider a fourth effect given the dynamical nature of our new simualtions . the matter enriched with metals moves as the simulation proceeds , and this motion modifies the volume filling factor . an isotropic outflow produced by a galaxy",
    "enriches matter that is located near the galaxy , and this matter is likely to later contract as it accretes over the cosmological structure hosting the galaxy .",
    "highly anisotropic outflows travel larger distances , and might enrich matter located far from cosmological structures , and potentially expanding away from them .",
    "notice that the number of galaxies formed is significantly larger than in paper  i ( @xmath155 in a cosmological volume that was 40% larger ) .",
    "as we showed in paper  i , the monte carlo method underestimates the number of galaxies compared to either an n - body simulation or the press - schechter approximation ( see fig .  4 in paper  i )",
    "this provides additional motivation for performing a full cosmological simulation .",

    "i , we generated a gaussian density field at high redshift , filtered it at various mass scales , and used the spherical collapse model to predict the location and collapse redshift of halos .",
    "hence , the location of halos was predetermined by the initial conditions , and these locations did not change with time .",

    "galaxies tend to be located inside larger cosmological structures , like filaments or pancakes .",
    "if several galaxies are located in a common structure , they can affect each other in two ways .",
    "first , the outflows might overlap , and second , if an outflow hits a halo that has not yet formed a galaxy , ram pressure stripping might prevent the galaxy from forming .",
    "these two effects are reduced when the outflows are anisotropic , because such outflows travel away from the cosmological structures , into low - density regions , and tend to avoid other galaxies and other outflows .",

    "instead they either approximately balanced the decline in individual outflow volumes for increasingly anisotropic outflows ( down to opening angles of @xmath127 ) or were dominated by them ( opening angles from @xmath127 to @xmath4 ) . the strength of clustering is much more apparent in the cosmological n - body simulations , and these effects now dominate . the higher level of clustering in the simulations here give greater weight to the impact of outflows that travel preferentially into low - density regions .",
    "most results which are sensitive to this effect are all stronger here : the reduced outflow overlap , the reduced stripping of halos , the increased extent of enrichment in low - density regions .",
    "there is one aspect in which these results show a weaker signal of anisotropy than paper  i : the enrichment of overdense systems . in paper",
    "i the fact that outflows travel into low - density regions resulted in a reduction in the physical extent of outflows in overdense regions , here however , anisotropic outflows increase the extent of outflows for densities all the way up to @xmath167 .",
    "this a consequence of the dynamic nature of our n - body simulations . at the time of launching",
    "the outflow may expand into underdense regions but as the simulation progresses the gas enriched by the outflow is re - accreted onto overdense structures .",
    "the impact of this accretion is also notable in the context of results from @xcite .",
    "they find that understanding the accretion of outflow gas back onto galaxies plays an important role in galaxy assembly and the stellar mass function of galaxies by @xmath193 .",
    "we find accretion of outflow gas onto large - scale structures plays an important role at @xmath194 and it seems likely that much of this gas continues its infall onto galaxies and fuels star formation .",
    "consider a galaxy producing an outflow that carries metals into low - density regions . as",
    "figures  [ slice180][slice60 ] show , outflows never travel very far from their sources .",
    "thus , the gas enriched by outflows is likely to be gravitationally bound to the structure hosting the galaxy .",
    "as that gas accretes onto that structure , it carries metals from a low- to a high - density region .",
    "this effect has been found by @xcite in a different context ( anisotropic outflows powered by agns ) .",
    "as these authors argue , even though anisotropic outflows deposit metals predominantly in low - density regions , the subsequent evolution of the large - scale structure will tend to partly wash out that effect .",
    "the only exception might occur when outflows travel very large distances , reaching gas inside deep voids that is not destined to accrete onto any structure within a hubble time .",
    "this happens with agn - powered outflows @xcite , but sne - powered outflows do not have enough energy to reach such distances .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper use the same outflow model as the ones presented in paper  i. only the method used for generating the population of halos ( monte carlo vs. n - body simulations ) and for calculating the enrichment of the igm ( static vs. dynamical ) are different .",
    "the outflow model contains several parameters , such as @xmath84 , @xmath86 , @xmath105 , and @xmath87 .",
    "we use the same values as in paper  i , and we refer the reader to that paper for a discussion on the limits on these various parameters .",
    "we have combined cosmological n - body simulations with a friend - of - friend algorithm for identifying halos and merger events , and an anisotropic outflow model , to study the metal - enrichment of the igm by sne - powered galactic outflows , in a @xmath1cdm universe .",
    "outflows are modeled as bipolar cones traveling along the direction of least resistance , which we take as the direction along which the density drops the fastest .",

    "our main results are the following .",
    "* anisotropic outflows travel predominantly into low - density regions , away from cosmological structures ( filament and pancakes ) that host most galaxies . as a result ,",
    "anisotropic outflows are less likely to overlap than isotropic ones , and are less likely to inhibit galaxy formation by stripping collapsing halos of their gas . the combination of these effect results in an increase of the volume filling factor of the igm with decreasing opening angle , from 8% with isotropic outflows , up to 28% with opening angle of @xmath9 .",
    "* the majority of collapsing halos hit by outflows end up being stripped of their gas , preventing the formation of a galaxies .",
    "the total number of galaxies formed drops by a factor of 2 when going from opening angle @xmath4 to @xmath8 .",
    "halos not stripped are enriched in metals , with negligible consequences for the formation time of the galaxy .",
    "in particular , fewer than one in @xmath195 galaxies that formed would not have formed without the hit , because their cooling time exceeded the hubble time . *",
    "the volume filling factor remain small ( 28% or less ) because outflows do not travel large distances .",
    "they remain fairly close to the structures where they originate , never reaching the center of the deep cosmological voids .",
    "the regions most efficiently enriched ( up to 90% by volume ) are the high - density regions , where the galaxies producing the outflows are located .",
    "the enrichment of low - density regions is not as efficient .",
    "however , by volume , most metals are located in these low - density region , because their combined volume greatly exceeds the combined volume of high - density regions .",
    "indeed , most of the enriched volume is in regions whose density is between @xmath196 and @xmath197 . *",
    "as outflows become more anisotropic ( smaller opening angle @xmath14 ) , the extent of enrichment increases at all densities , low and high .",
    "the effect is most important at low densities , where the efficiency increases by factors of several . at very - high densities , @xmath198 ,",
    "regions are already 80% enriched by volume by isotropic outflows , so there is little room for an additional increase . *",
    "overall , anisotropic outflows do not strongly favor low - density regions at the expense high - density ones , unlike what was found in paper  i. anisotropic outflows are more numerous , resulting in higher probability of enrichment at all densities .",
    "when this effect is factored - out , we find that the probability that a galaxy will enrich systems at densities up to @xmath12 is higher for increasingly anisotropic outflows .",
    "this results from evolution of the metal - enriched igm .",
    "enriched gas tends to be located relatively near the large - scale structures hosting the galaxies responsible for this enrichment .",
    "as that enriched gas accretes onto these structures , the effect of anisotropy is partly washed out .",
    "* photoionization suppression of low - mass galaxy formation leads to a number of modifications to our enrichment predictions . since many of these low mass galaxies",
    "would otherwise have formed in or near voids of our density distribution , their suppression leads to a reduction in the enrichment of low - density regions .",
    "also a surprising , but not implausible , consequence of this prescription is a fall in volume fraction of enriched regions after @xmath13 .",
    "this is a consequence of suppression of much late galaxy formation combined with the accretion of enriched structures back onto high - density , low - volume regions .",
    "this work benefited from stimulating discussions with cdric grenon .",

    "while building merger trees , we discovered that some clusters of @xmath59 particles were actually _ splitting _ , that is , breaking up into two or more components .",
    "such splitting might be real .",
    "a small cluster located in the vicinity of a larger one might get stretched by the tidal field to the point where it breaks up , or it might get so elongated that the fof algorithm identifies it as several clusters . this can also be a purely numerical effect , which could occur in two different situations : ( 1 ) two clusters that pass near each others without merging come briefly into contact .",
    "if the fof algorithm is applied while the clusters are in contact , they will be identified as one single cluster , that then splits .",
    "( 2 ) when two clusters approach each others on a collision course , they will be identified as one single cluster as soon as one particle from the first cluster and one particle from the other cluster are within a linking length of one another .",
    "then , because of the internal motion of the particles inside clusters , the two clusters might lose and re - establish contact several times during the following timesteps , before they finally merge for good .",
    "these effects are artifacts of the fof algorithm , and usually go unnoticed unless one uses a very fine time resolution when building merger trees . in this paper",
    ", we build cluster catalogs spaced by time intervals of @xmath199 , which gives us merger trees with 306 levels between redshift @xmath41 and @xmath16 .",
    "with such a fine time resolution , these ` splitters ' become a real problem , which needs to be addressed . more specifically ,",
    "since mergers result in starburst , we have to be sure that mergers identified by the fof algorithm are real .",

    "when a cluster forms by a merger , and then splits , we calculate the time @xmath205 during which the cluster survived before splitting .",
    "if @xmath201 , we consider that the cluster was not present long enough to be considered real , and therefore the merger that formed that cluster and the subsequent splitter that destroyed it were both spurious .",
    "this handles the first case described above , that is of two clusters that briefly come into contact during a non - merging encounter .",
    "this leaves the second case , two clusters that experience a series of mergers and splitters before finally merging for good . in this case , every time the cluster splits , the two pieces will re - merge after a time @xmath200 . if this time is sufficiently short , we assume that the split and the subsequent re - merging were spurious , and that the cluster actually never split .",
    "we use the criterion @xmath202 , where @xmath204 is the time of stability that was used in the other criterion .",
    "we have applied this method to the merger tree built from our simulation , using a time of stability @xmath203 .",
    "we have identified all cases where a cluster splits . for each case , we calculated the time @xmath205 during which the cluster existed before it split , and the time @xmath200 elapsed before the various pieces re - merged together ( this can be infinite if the pieces never re - merged ) . in figure",
    "[ split ] , we show a plot of @xmath200 vs. @xmath205 , where the contours show the actual number of clusters . most clusters have either @xmath201 , @xmath202 , or both . hence , according to our criterion , these splitters are not real , and we simply ignore them",
    ". a small fraction of splitters fail both criteria , and are considered real splitters .",
    "such splitters occur when a small halo is torn apart by the tidal field of a larger one .",
    "this violent process should result in a significant reheating of the gas , which can later cool down and lead to a starburst .",
    "consequently , we treat a halo formed by a splitter like we treat halos formed by monolithic collapse and mergers : we calculate its cooling time , and after that time has elapsed , we start a new outflow .",
    "note that the details of this treatment are not critical , since real splitters are rare .",
    "in sb01 and paper  i , the spherical top - hat collapse model was used to estimate the size of uncollapsed halos when these halos are hit by outflows .",
    "the comoving radius of a halo is given by @xmath206        notice that at high redshift ( when @xmath215 and @xmath216 ) , @xmath217 .",
    "hence , the denominator in equation  ( [ rphys ] ) is nearly constant . the time - dependence in equation  ( [ rphys ] )",
    "essentially comes from the factor @xmath218 in the numerator .",
    "the halo has a physical size of 0 at @xmath219 ( corresponding to the big bang ) , reaches maximum size at @xmath220 , and collapses to a black hole at @xmath221 .    in practice",
    ", halos will not collapse to a black hole .",
    "after turnaround , radial motions will be converted into transverse motions , and eventually the halo will virialize , with a physical radius that is 1/2 of the maximum physical radius ( that is , the halo shrinks by a factor of 2 in radius after turnaround ) .",
    "we do not have a precise model for the evolution of the system between turnaround and virialization .",
    "a fair assumption is that the time it takes for the halo to shrink by a factor of 2 is equal to the time it would have taken to collapse to a black hole in the absence of virialization ( @xcite ; see however @xcite ) . to achieve this result ,",
    "we modify equation  ( [ rcom ] ) and ( [ rphys ] ) , using            figure  [ spherical ] shows the evolution of a spherical halo collapsing at redshift @xmath224 in a universe with @xmath17 and @xmath19 .",
