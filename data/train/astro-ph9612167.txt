    "for years , it has been known that extensive quantities of ionized hydrogen , not restricted to the immediate vicinity of high mass stars , exists in the milky way and several external galaxies . in the galaxy ,",
    "this gas is referred to as the reynolds layer ( reynolds 1991 ) , while a more general description is diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) or the warm ionized medium ( wim ) .",
    "dig is seen as a thick layer above the disk of some edge on galaxies ( eg . ngc 891 : rand 1996 , rand et al .",
    "1990 , dettmar 1990 , dettmar & schulz 1992 , keppel et al . 1991 ; ngc 4631 : dettmar 1992 , rand et al .",

    "1996 , ferguson et al .",
    "1996b ) . in all cases ,",
    "most of the dig is found to be concentrated in regions of star formation , although isolated patches and filaments are found as well .",
    "while observations of this component of the ism have occurred with increasing frequency over the last 5 years , the ionization and overall 3-d morphology are still poorly understood .",
    "various models have been suggested to account for the ionization : lyman continuum photons emitted by ob stars ( mathis 1986 , domg@xmath12rgen & mathis 1994 , dove & shull 1994 , miller & cox 1993 ) , turbulent mixing of hot and cool gases ( slavin et al . 1993 ) , shocks from supernovae ( see reynolds 1984 ) , and decaying dark matter ( sciama 1990 , 1993 , & 1995 ) .",
    "each of these models has its difficulties , with some problems being more severe than others .",
    "photoionization models need large mean free paths for ionizing radiation , requiring the ism to be perhaps more porous than previously thought .",
    "however , these models are most attractive from an energetics standpoint , although still requiring up to 40% of the ionizing radiation from ob stars .",
    "conversely , shocks from supernovae and mixing layer models are unable to ionize all of the dig , even if all the energy of supernovae were available . also , emission line ratios of the emitting gas constrain the shock speeds to an uncomfortably narrow range ( @xmath13 km / s ) ( raymond 1979 , shull & mckee 1979 ) .",
    "decaying dark matter models require other sources of ionizing radiation to produce [ nii](@xmath14 ) , hei(@xmath15 ) , and [ oiii](@xmath16 ) ( sciama 1995 ) , and should be considered speculative .",
    "observations of dig in external galaxies have largely been accomplished with imaging of h@xmath17 and [ sii](@xmath9 ) , and recently , [ oii]@xmath183727 , the blend of [ oii](@xmath19 ) , through narrow band ( 25 - 75@xmath0 ) filters ( eg . walterbos & braun 1992 , 1994 ; ferguson et al .",
    "1996a , b ; rand et al . 1990 , 1992 ) .",
    "spectroscopic studies have been mostly confined to thick ionized layers above edge - on systems ( rand 1996 , golla et al .",
    "1996 ) and filaments in irregulars ( e.g. hunter and gallagher 1996 ) .",
    "the imaging studies have shown that a surprisingly consistent fraction ( 30 - 50% ) of the total h@xmath17 emission from spirals arises in the dig .",
    "some recent studies have suggested that the [ sii]/h@xmath17 intensity ratio increases with decreasing surface brightness . to better test ionization models , observations of other lines",
    "are important .",
    "while the observations of edge - on systems address the ionization and excitation state of the gas _ above _ galactic disks , they do not provide information on the line ratios _ in _ the galactic disks .",
    "here we present the initial results from a spectroscopic study of the emission from faint dig in the non - edge - on spiral m31 .",
    "the spatial resolution provided by m31 s proximity allows clear separation of dig regions from hii regions .",
    "this lack of `` confusion '' aids in the observation of faint dig .",
    "previous sensitive h@xmath17 imaging ( walterbos & braun 1992 , 1994 ) over most of the ne half of the galaxy provided valuable complimentary information and aided the acquisition and interpretation of these spectroscopic data .    in  2 we review the observational procedures and data reduction techniques .",
    "the observed forbidden line ratios are presented in  3 , along with the detection of hei and temperature estimates . in ",
    "4 we compare the predictions of ionization models to our observations . in  5 we discuss the observed characteristics of dig in m31 to that in other galaxies .",
    "finally ,  6 contains a summary of our results .",
    "the spectra were obtained using the rc spectrograph on the mayall 4-m telescope at kitt peak national observatory on nov .",
    "3 - 5 , 1991 .",
    "the detector was a tek ccd chip with 1024x1024 pixels , each 0.69 arcseconds ( 2.3 pc for m31 ) on a side .",
    "a slit of about 6 arcminutes length and 2 arcseconds width was used .",
    "the slit was rotated to provide the best compromise between the ideal parallactic angle and the desire to include many interesting objects on the slit , eg .",
    "hii regions , snrs , and regions of diffuse ionized gas .",
    "these objects were identified on h@xmath17 and [ sii ] images obtained by walterbos and braun ( 1992 ) .",
    "sixteen different slit positions were observed in the ne half of m31 .",
    "they are mainly concentrated in the spiral arms , over a range in galactic radii of 5 to 15 kpc , with a concentration of slit locations in the 10 kpc star formation `` annulus '' .",
    "the locations of the slits on the sky will be presented elsewhere , when we discuss the results for the individual spectra ( greenawalt et al .",
    "1997 ) ; here we are concerned only with the average dig spectra at various brightness levels .",
    "we used the kpc-10a grating , with 316 lines / mm which is blazed to provided maximum sensitivity at 4000@xmath0 in first order .",
    "the final dispersion with this grating was 2.77@xmath0/pixel .",
    "for each slit position the grating was toggled between two tilt angles , centering the spectra on 4950@xmath0 and 5500@xmath0 , to provide a blue and a red spectrum .",
    "this strategy provided wavelength coverage from 3550 - 6850@xmath0 with considerable overlap . at each tilt angle ,",
    "two 15 minute object spectra and one wavelength calibration spectrum were taken .",
    "standard iraf tasks were used to reduce the data .",
    "the ccd dc offset was removed by fitting the overscan regions on each spectrum .",
    "any residual bias structure was removed using a combination of bias images taken each night .",
    "pixel - to - pixel variations were corrected using spectra of a quartz lamp illuminating the dome .",
    "cosmic rays were edited out manually to insure that no spectral features were altered .",
    "each pair of spectra for a particular slit position and central wavelength were averaged together .",
    "the wavelength solution for the matching spectrum of a henear arc lamp was determined , then applied to the object spectrum .",
    "the spectra were flux calibrated using a standard star spectrum obtained during the night .",
    "one standard star observation from each night was used to calibrate the entire nights data .",
    "the sky conditions were clear , but we did not rigorously verify if conditions were photometric .",
    "nevertheless , the emission measures we derive on the average spectra ( see below ) agree well with those derived from the corresponding image sections on the h@xmath17 images obtained by walterbos & braun ( 1994 ) .",
    "the detector focus was slightly poorer at the edge of the field compared to the center of the field .",
    "a spectral line was therefore broader and the peak brightness was lower at the edge of the field .",
    "because of this structure in the night sky lines , fitting a constant or a linear fit to a night sky line resulted in unacceptably large residuals when attempting a standard sky subtraction .",
    "tests showed that a 7th order polynomial fit provided the best subtraction of the 4 brightest night sky lines , @xmath20\\lambda5577 , nai(blend)\\lambda\\lambda5890 + 5896 , [ oi]\\lambda6300 , and [ oi]\\lambda6364 $ ] .",
    "since these lines have no underlying m31 nebular emission , such a high order fit was well constrained .",
    "rmoval of the other night sky lines is more complicated , however .",
    "the strengths of individual night sky lines vary in differing amounts from one spectrum to the next .",
    "thus even if we had observed separate blank - sky spectra , we would not have obtained good removal of all night sky lines in individual m31 spectra .",
    "the standard technique , of fitting on background regions in each individual spectrum could only be used in a limited way , since the emission from dig in m31 extended over most of the slit , severely limiting the choice of `` background '' regions .",
    "in addition , with only a few background regions per spectrum a high order fit to the sky features was not possible .",
    "therefore , we were forced to develop an alternative background subtraction method .",
    "this method took advantage of the fact that the structure of a night sky line did not vary as the strength of the line changed .    in",
    "what follows it may be useful to remember that the dispersion direction is sometimes referred to as `` columns '' or `` vertical direction '' , while the spatial direction along the slit is referred to as `` rows '' .",
    "all spectra were shifted to a common wavelength grid .",
    "first , the four brightest night sky lines were removed from the individual spectra , using the following method .",
    "the smoothly varying continuum in each spectrum was removed by subtracting a median filtered version of the original spectrum .",
    "continuum sources , such as foreground stars & m31 emission , were removed as well in this step , leaving only the individual fainter night sky lines and the nebular emission features in the spectra .",
    "the smoothly varying continuum of the sky brightness was determined by applying a rectangular median filter box of 1@xmath21151 pixels , with the long dimension aligned with the dispersion axis . on the spectrum with",
    "the continuum subtracted , a 7th order 1-d polynomial was fit to each of the rows containing emission from the four bright sky lines .",
    "these fits were then removed from the original spectrum .",
    "the method was iterated until the sky line subtraction produced no noticeable depressions in the continuum level at the wavelength of the lines . removing the brightest lines first",
    "was required to avoid the creation of large dips near the locations of these lines when subtracting the median filtered image .",
    "all subsequent steps were performed on the spectra from which the four bright night sky lines had been removed .",
    "next , we determined templates of the remaining night sky lines , which could then be used to remove these lines from the spectra .",
    "for this purpose , we selected the two spectra with the least amount of nebular emission from m31 , hence with the most `` background '' regions on which the night sky lines could be fit .",
    "we again first removed the smoothly varying continuum , as described above . on each spectrum , we then selected background regions , to which 3rd order 1-d polynomials were fit , row by row .",
    "higher order fits were not possible given the extent along the slit of the background regions available .",
    "the polynomial fits to each spectrum were written out as a template spectrum of night sky lines .",
    "the resulting two templates were averaged together to produce a final night sky line template .    the final step consisted of removing the night sky lines from all spectra using this template . to do this",
    ", we again determined the smoothly varying continuum for each spectrum using the median filter as described above , and subtracted this from the original spectrum .",
    "we then identified background regions on all spectra . for each row",
    ", we determined the mean intensity in the background regions , and the corresponding mean intensity in the night sky template for the same regions .",
    "this provided the scaling factor required to create an individual night sky template for each spectrum ; this was then subtracted from the original spectrum , with the continuum still in it , to produce the final m31 spectra . even in cases where the emission filled most of the slit",
    ", good sky subtraction was obtained this way . by subtracting the templates from the original spectra , no potential artifacts introduced by",
    "the median filtering can affect the data . with the night sky lines removed ,",
    "only a smoothly varying background component , due to continuum emission from m31 and the night sky , was left to remove .",
    "a linear fit to the background regions along each row proved sufficient to remove this final background component .",
    "after the background was subtracted , we identified the various emission - line objects covered by each slit location , using the narrow - band images of the fields ( walterbos and braun 1992 ) .",
    "based on morphology and brightness level , we classified 54 apertures as containing dig .",
    "these ranged from roughly 10 to 60 pixels in extent , with a mean value of 23.5 pixels ( 54 pcs ) .",
    "apertures containing hii regions , supernova remnants , candidate luminous blue variables , wolf - rayet stars and other objects were also extracted . these will be discussed elsewhere ( walterbos et al . 1996 , galarza et al . 1997 ) .",
    "all extracted spectra were shifted so the emission lines were at their respective rest wavelengths .",
    "this step removed the systemic velocity of m31 and any rotational velocity differences between the dig locations .",
    "using gaussian fits to line profiles in the task splot , the h@xmath17 flux was measured for each dig aperture and then converted to average intensity using the number of summed pixels in each aperture . the emission measures ( em ) derived from the h@xmath17 surface brightness , assuming t@xmath22k , of the dig within the 54 apertures ranged from 12 - 71 pc @xmath3 . after ordering the apertures by decreasing surface brightness",
    ", they were separated into 3 groups of 18 apertures each .",
    "the 1d spectra within each group were then combined to produce representative spectra of `` bright '' , `` moderate '' , and `` faint '' dig , with ems of 58.4 , 33.8 , and 17.7 pc @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "in addition , twelve dig regions located well away from any bright hii regions or filaments were combined to produce a representative spectrum of dig `` far '' from hii regions .",
    "this dig had an average em = 22.6 pc @xmath3 . to compliment these spectra , we extracted 26 apertures of regions with very faint emission which showed only marginal detection of h@xmath17 in individual cases .",
    "these were shifted using adjacent apertures of brighter emission as reference , then combined to produce a representative spectrum of the `` very faint '' dig with emission measure of 9.1 pc @xmath3 .",
    "the 1@xmath1 noise in all final co - added spectra was roughly @xmath23 , corresponding to an em of .46 pc @xmath3 .",
    "this noise level is low compared to the faintest dig we extracted from the spectra , mainly because the noise in individual spectra is much higher , so identifying regions at these faint levels is not trivial .",
    "in addition , since emission may fill most of the slits completely , extracting fainter spectra introduces a systematic uncertainty in the derived line ratios due to possible subtraction of a low - level ( estimated by walterbos & braun ( 1994 ) to be no higher than em = 3 pc @xmath3 ) genuine dig component . the low noise in the co - added spectra implies that we have excellent s / n even for the `` very faint '' dig .",
    "table 1 contains the line ratios for each of these combined spectra .",
    "the quoted `` uncertainties '' in the surface brightness of the combined spectra correspond to the 1@xmath1 rms spread in the distribution of surface brightnesses of the individual spectra .",
    "in the case of the `` very faint '' dig , this number is an estimate , since surface brightnesses for individual spectra were not measured .",
    "uncertainties quoted for line ratios reflect 1@xmath1 errors determined from the combined spectra .",
    "we will report on results for the individual spectra in a different paper ( greenawalt et al .",
    "it is important to point out that the intrinsic spread in the line ratios from one region to another is much larger than the quoted uncertainties here , which are derived from the co - added spectra .",
    "thus there is significant variation in line ratios across the dig but globally the line ratios vary little .",
    "the measured emission line intensities from each combined spectrum were corrected for reddening using the balmer decrement and a standard galactic extinction curve ( savage & mathis 1979 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath24 was 4.4 for the `` very faint '' dig spectrum and roughly 3.6 for others , compared to an unreddened value of 2.86 for 10@xmath25 k gas . because the absorbing material may well be mixed with the dig , we calculated corrected line ratios for both a foreground screen model and a model consisting of a galactic foreground dust screen and a homogeneous mixture of dust and dig in m31 . for a foreground dust screen ,",
    "the extinction implied by the observed line ratios is a@xmath26 .7 ( a@xmath26 1.2 for the `` very faint '' dig ) , roughly twice the foreground galactic extinction , for which e(b - v ) = .1 ( e.g. , walterbos & schwering 1987 ) .",
    "the model , with a component of dust and dig mixed in m31 , suggests the dust column from this component alone would correspond to an a@xmath26 .6 - 1.1 if it were a foreground screen ( a@xmath27 for the `` very faint '' spectrum ) , in addition to the foreground galactic extinction , a@xmath28 . because of the dust distribution in this model , the corrected line ratios are actually slightly smaller compared to a model of only foreground extinction , in spite of the increased estimation of the total extinction . in the most extreme case of @xmath6}/i_{h\\alpha}$ ] , the line ratios are reduced by less than 5% ( less than 10% for the `` very faint '' ) , roughly consistent with our 1 @xmath1 error estimation . because the exact distribution of dust has little effect on the corrected line ratio in this case , we quote corrected line ratios assuming the extinction arises within a foreground dust layer .",
    "the reddening corrected ratios of other balmer line ratios , in particular , @xmath29 and @xmath30 for all dig spectra are consistent with the expected values for unreddened 10@xmath25 k ionized gas .",
    "portions of the observed spectra around h@xmath17 are shown in fig .",
    "1 . the figure gives a good indication of our signal - to - noise and wavelength resolution .",
    "night sky lines just blueward of h@xmath17 caused some problems with the accurate determination of both the strength of the [ nii]@xmath31 line and the baseline level ; all [ nii ] measurements therefore refer to the @xmath32 line .",
    "we find a constant @xmath33\\lambda6583}/i_{h\\alpha}$ ] ratio of .35 for all four brightness levels of dig , but a slightly higher value of .40 for dig `` far '' from hii regions .",
    "this is similar to that measured for hii regions and for the reynolds layer in our galaxy ( reynolds 1990 ) .",
    "the strength of the [ sii]@xmath9 lines relative to the h@xmath17 line has been recognized for some years to be different in dig versus hii regions .",
    "many imaging programs have used the value of @xmath34}/i_{h\\alpha}$ ] along with the brightness of h@xmath17 to distinguish dig in nearby galaxies ( e.g. walterbos and braun 1994 , hoopes et al .",
    "1996 , ferguson et al .",
    "our spectra show values of @xmath10}/i_{h\\alpha}$ ] in the range of .40-.50 , which is significantly larger than the average value of .25 observed in hii regions ( walterbos and braun 1994 , also fig .",
    "the ratio obtained for the `` far '' dig is .60 , considerably higher .",
    "there appears to be a trend of increasing ratio with decreasing surface brightness , both in the combined spectra and in the individual spectra before combination ( greenawalt et al . 1997 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows a large portion of the blue spectra .",
    "wavelengths shortward of 4200@xmath0 were observed only in the blue spectra , and therefore have lower signal - to - noise .",
    "the decline of detector sensitivity and reduced atmospheric transmission in this wavelength region also have a negative effect on the signal - to - noise . in spite of these facts",
    ", we clearly detect the [ oii ] doublet at @xmath4 in all dig spectra .",
    "the reddening corrected @xmath35}/i_{h\\beta}$ ] ratio is 2.6 for the `` bright '' and `` moderate '' spectra , 3.4 for the `` faint '' spectrum , and 4.1 for the `` very faint '' spectrum .",
    "this translates to @xmath6}/i_{h\\alpha}$ ] = .9 , 1.2 , and 1.4 , respectively .",
    "the ratio obtained for the `` far '' dig is basically the same as for the `` faint '' dig .",
    "the [ oiii]@xmath36 line is weak and not seen in the spectra of the faintest dig , but the stronger of the doublet , [ oiii]@xmath5 , is accurately measured in all spectra",
    ". the @xmath37\\lambda5007}/i_{h\\beta}$ ] ratio for dig in m31 ranges from .35 to .60 .",
    "note that the [ oi]@xmath186300 line , if present , could not have been detected in m31 because of the bright [ oi]@xmath186300 night sky line . the hydrogen lines h@xmath38 , h@xmath39 , and h@xmath40 were also detected in the three brightest dig spectra .",
    "the observations of strong [ sii](@xmath41 ) and [ nii](@xmath14 ) emission coupled with weak [ oi]@xmath42 and [ oiii]@xmath5 emission from the reynolds layer within our galaxy and the thick ionized layer surrounding ngc 891 , imply that low ionization species dominate .",
    "while some ionization models are able to reproduce the observed line ratios , the hardness of the incident ionizing spectrum is a key to distinguishing between models .",
    "the hei@xmath43 recombination line is sensitive to the spectral type of the ionizing star , since ionization of he requires stars of spectral type earlier than about o8 ( torres - peimbert et al .",
    "this emission line is the strongest helium line in the visible regime , but is still extremely weak compared to h@xmath17 .",
    "3 shows the region around hei@xmath43 in the spectrum of the `` bright '' and `` moderate '' dig .",
    "the figure shows the red spectra prior to combination with the blue spectra . because this region is close to the edge of the chip in the blue spectra , background subtraction was more difficult resulting in larger residuals for the night sky lines around hei .",
    "the red spectrum of the `` bright '' dig shows a detection of hei@xmath43 . there is a feature in the blue spectrum consistent with the detection of hei at the same strength as in the red spectrum , even though the night sky lines residuals are greater .",
    "the bright nai@xmath44 night sky lines just redward of hei did not subtract perfectly , producing the obvious dip in baselevel .",
    "although there are shifts of the emission features in the original spectra relative to the night sky lines amounting to about 5@xmath0 because of m31 s galactic rotational velocity differences for various slit positions , the hei line is always separated from this bright night sky line .",
    "however , a weaker oh molecular blend is blueward of hei and sometimes blended with the line .",
    "this blend produces a broad pedestal in the `` moderate '' dig spectrum where we do not detect the hei line , also shown in fig .",
    "3 . because there is the possibility that this fainter night sky line could contribute to our estimate of the strength of the hei line via a slight hump on the blue side of the hei line",
    ", we consider our determination of the hei line flux to be uncertain . to avoid a possible contribution from this hump we estimated the strength of the hei line from the _ peak _ line intensity for hei compared to h@xmath17 , as opposed to comparing total line fluxes .",
    "the measured ratio of @xmath45 = .045@xmath46.015 .",
    "the upper limits from the other spectra are still consistent with this level of ionization , but , of course , also with lower levels of ionization of he .",
    "the sky subtraction produced sky line residuals in this region of the red `` faint '' and `` very faint '' spectra consistent with other regions , although not shown in fig .",
    "our estimated ratio for @xmath45 is consistent with the value found for galactic hii regions , .045 ( reynolds & tufte 1995 ) .",
    "this implies that stars of spectral type earlier than o7 are required to contribute to the ionization of the dig .",
    "reynolds & tufte unsuccessfully searched for helium emission from two directions through the reynolds layer .",
    "their 2@xmath1 upper limit of @xmath45 = .012@xmath46.006 implies that he is primarily neutral and the radiation field is softer than previously thought .",
    "the two directions observed have surface brightness levels of about 30 pc @xmath3 , the same as our `` moderate '' spectra .",
    "since , we are only able to place upper limits on @xmath45 for the `` moderate '' , `` faint '' and `` very faint '' dig , the question remains open as to the hardness of the radiation field responsible for the fainter dig .",
    "however , it is appears that the radiation field present in the `` bright '' dig of m31 is harder than in galactic dig .",
    "this may result from the fact that our observations focus on dig regions within the spiral arms of m31 , while the galactic observations sampled dig farther from spiral arm structures .",
    "recent observations of ionized gas out of the plane of ngc 891 have found @xmath45 = .033 ( rand 1996 ) .",
    "this ratio suggests that helium is about 70% ionized and the equivalent stellar temperature of the radiation field is 37,500k , corresponding to spectral type o7 .",
    "the consistency of these measurements with our estimation for the `` bright '' dig in m31 is somewhat surprising , especially given the discrepancy with galactic dig . given that ngc 891 and the milky way are considered `` twins '' , with large ionized layers above the plane of each , one might expect the hei line strength to be similar in the extraplanar dig for these galaxies and possibly different for the dig located within the plane of m31 .    also located in this spectral region",
    "is the [ nii]@xmath15 line .",
    "this line is expected to be extremely weak , but important for temperature determination when compared to [ nii]@xmath47 .",
    "equation 5.5 of osterbrock ( 1989 ) , in the low - density limit ( which is confirmed by [ sii ] lines ) , reads : @xmath48\\lambda 6548 + [ nii]\\lambda 6583}\\over { [ nii]\\lambda 5755 } } = 6.91 exp \\biggl ( { { 2.5 \\times 10 ^ 4}\\over{t } } \\biggr ) .\\ ] ] while we have no clear detection of the [ nii]@xmath49 line even in the `` bright '' dig spectrum , we can estimate an upper limit to the temperature using the measured noise at the line position .",
    "the measured noise gave a 3@xmath1 upper limit on the line flux of @xmath50 .",
    "this noise limit does not place a strong constraint on the temperature of the dig , but does suggest it is most likely below 17,000k .",
    "by comparing the predictions of several ionization models and observations of dig in the galaxy to the observations of dig in m31 , we will attempt to address its ionization source . the pertinent line ratios from galactic dig and models discussed below are included in table 1 for comparison with the observed line ratios discussed above .",
    "figures 4 and 5 are excitation diagrams which are useful in determining the model best able to fit the observed line ratios for dig . line ratios for several hii regions from our data set ( galarza et al .",
    "1997 ) have been included to illustrate the striking differences from dig regions . in particular ,",
    "the [ sii](@xmath9)/h@xmath17 ratio is at least a factor of 2 greater in the dig compared to the compact hii regions , and the [ oii]@xmath4/h@xmath17 ratio on average is higher in the dig than the compact hii regions .",
    "at least for the solar neighborhood , miller & cox ( 1993 ) have shown that the observed o star distribution can supply the required ionizing radiation to produce the observed galactic dig .",
    "mathis ( 1986 ) and domg@xmath51rgen & mathis ( 1994 ) ( hereafter dm ) produced photoionization models based on the idea that diffuse stellar radiation is able to travel through a low - density ism to ionize h far from high mass stars .",
    "the governing model parameters are x@xmath52 , the fraction of neutral hydrogen at the model edge , and q , a measure of the mean ionizing photon density within the nebula to the mean electron density .",
    "their `` composite '' models are a mixture of 20% x@xmath52=.95 gas ( ie .",
    "edges of hi clouds ) , and 80% x@xmath52=.1 gas , which produces much of the h@xmath17 emission . in this `` composite '' model ,",
    "most of the emission is attributed to a low x@xmath52 model because only these models produce the low @xmath53}/i_{h\\alpha}$ ] ratio observed in the galactic dig .",
    "composite models were only published for log(q ) in the range -3 to -4 , which appears appropriate for the galactic dig .",
    "these composite models fit the observed @xmath33}/i_{h\\alpha}$ ] and @xmath35}/i_{h\\beta}$ ] ratio , although the observed values of [ oii ] seem to have a larger scatter than model predictions ( see fig 5 ) . as is obvious from fig .",
    "4 , these composite models seem to slightly overpredict [ sii ] while underpredicting [ oiii ] .",
    "the composite models were created to reproduce observations of the galactic dig , which has a low @xmath7}/i_{h\\beta}$ ] ratio .",
    "mathis ( 1996 ) has suggested that increasing [ oiii ] in model predictions would be easy , since it was difficult to bring down the ratio to match galactic dig observations .",
    "domg@xmath51rgen & mathis also published results for x@xmath52=.10 models alone , with a much larger range of q values .",
    "the @xmath6}/i_{h\\alpha}$ ] ratio was only published for log(q ) = -3 , -3.7 , and -4 models , and showed a variation of less than 1% for these models .",
    "we therefore estimated the strength for other models to be the same .",
    "a model with q=.005 fits our observed line ratios the best , but values from .002 to .01 are consistent with the data .",
    "the larger q values imply a larger ratio of ionizing photons to gas density .",
    "because the observed surface brightness of m31 dig is in the same range as galactic dig ( 5 - 35 pc @xmath3 ) , we are not detecting systematically brighter dig in m31 .",
    "the difference in line ratios suggests that the conditions in m31 are somewhat different than in the milky way .",
    "the dig regions we observed are primarily in spiral arms , while the galactic dig regions are not .",
    "the less diluted radiation field required to fit our observation may reflect the fact that there is a more prominent stellar radiation field within spiral arms .",
    "this is supported by the hei detection in m31 compared to the upper limit found for galactic dig .",
    "we expect that the larger q value is the important factor in finding a model that fits our observations , not the specifics of `` composite '' or single x@xmath52 model . because we have no meaningful limits on [ oi ] , a low x@xmath52 model is not necessarily required .",
    "results for a `` composite '' model for these larger q values would be valuable .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "4 , the dm models predict an increase in the @xmath34}/i_{h\\alpha}$ ] ratio with decreasing q parameter .",
    "if the q parameter appropriate for a given dig region is related to the surface brightness of the region , then the models predict an increase in @xmath34}/i_{h\\alpha}$ ] with decreasing surface brightness .",
    "just such a trend is observed in our representative spectra , and the individual spectra ( greenawalt et al . 1997 ) .",
    "ferguson et al . ( 1996a ) have also seen a similar continuous range of @xmath34}/i_{h\\alpha}$ ] ratios from dig to hii regions in the edge - on galaxy ngc 55 .",
    "these observed trends would suggest that dig and hii regions are intimately related by photoionization , and are actually two extremes in a continuous class of warm ionized gas structures . however , it is not clear why a similar trend of decreasing @xmath7}/i_{h\\alpha}$ ] with increasing surface brightness is not seen as predicted by the dm models .",
    "the turbulent mixing of hot and cool gas to produce warm gas at the boundary has been used by slavin et al .",
    "( 1993 ) ( hereafter , ssb ) to model some of the dig in the galaxy .",
    "they proposed that energy input from supernovae could be responsible for ionizing roughly 20% of the galactic dig .",
    "hundreds of mixing layers along any given line of sight are thought to account for the observed surface brightness of ionized gas .",
    "the mixing speed of the hot gas and the temperature attained by the warm gas are important in the model .",
    "we compare to their solar abundance models because the depleted abundance models predict elevated [ sii ] line strengths which do not fit the observations as well .",
    "the predictions for models with log(@xmath54)= 5.0 , 5.3 , and 5.5 are denoted with an `` s '' in figs 4 & 5 . at each temperature ,",
    "two mixing speeds are presented ( v = 25 & 100 @xmath55 ) .",
    "attributing all emission to mixing layers is not plausible , because an extremely specific choice of parameters is required to match the observations . as can be seen in figs 4 & 5 , for the log(@xmath54)= 5.3 & 5.5 models , the [ oiii ] predictions",
    "are an order of magnitude above the observed values , while the [ oii ] line is a factor of 5 above the observed values .",
    "lowering the temperature decreases the oxygen line strengths , but a small change in temperature produces a very drastic decrease in the line strengths .",
    "lowering the temperature to log(@xmath54)= 5.0 ( a factor of 2 or 3 ) , brings the [ oii ] strength to a comparable level to the observations .",
    "the [ oiii ] line strength drops by two orders of magnitude , so that it is now seriously underpredicted , as is the [ sii ] line strength .",
    "given the extreme sensitivity of model predictions to this temperature range , a very specific set of model parameters would be required to fit the observations .",
    "however , such a specific choice of parameters may be unlikely to be valid for many dig regions spread over a large portion of a spiral galaxy , which is what comprises our representative dig spectra .",
    "therefore , regardless of the energetic arguments , this model in itself appears unlikely to account for all observed dig .",
    "given the above arguments , turbulent mixing is likely only responsible for a small fraction of the dig ionization , with photoionization being the dominant source .",
    "therefore , a mixture of the ssb and dm models may be a more accurate way of modelling the observed line ratios . given the predicted line ratios for the dm and ssb models it is straightforward to determine the predicted line ratios for a model which attributes a certain fraction of the ionization of the dig to turbulent mixing layers and the remaining amount to photoionization .",
    "specifically , the predicted line ratio will be @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the predicted line ratio for a component that contributions the fraction @xmath58 to the total ionization .",
    "we calculated line ratios for models that combined either the ssb log(@xmath54)= 5.0 , v=100 km s@xmath59 model ( labeled s@xmath60 in figs .",
    "4 & 5 ) or the log(@xmath54)= 5.3 , v=25 km s@xmath59 model ( labeled s@xmath61 ) with the dm x@xmath52=.1 model with q=.005 ( tick mark 6 in figs . 4 & 5 ) .",
    "calculations were made for 5% , 10% , 20% , and 30% contribution from turbulent mixing .",
    "turbulent mixing at v=25 km s@xmath59 that results in gas with log(@xmath54)= 5.3 is unlikely to contribute more than 5% to the `` very faint '' dig in m31 because the predicted @xmath7}/i_{h\\alpha}$ ] ratio would be well above our observations . the predictions for this model do not match any other observations , except possibly the `` moderate '' dig if the contribution from turbulent mixing is at the few percent level .",
    "turbulent mixing at v=100 km s@xmath59 , resulting in gas with log(@xmath54)= 5.0 , can contribute up to 20% and still be consistent with our observation of the dig in m31 .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "4 , although up to 20% of the ionization can arise from turbulent mixing , smaller contributions fit our observations better .",
    "models that attributed the remaining fraction of ionization to dm s `` composite '' model with log(q)=-3.7 instead of the x@xmath52=.1 model predicted @xmath34}/i_{h\\alpha}$ ] , @xmath7}/i_{h\\alpha}$ ] , and @xmath35}/i_{h\\alpha}$ ] ratios that did not fit any observations .",
    "recent spectroscopy of ngc 891 ( rand 1996 ) has shown that @xmath62}/i_{h\\alpha}$ ] varies from a value of .4 , in the plane , to about 1.4 , 3.5 kpc out of the plane .",
    "this is quite different than similar observations for ngc 4631 ( golla et al .",
    "1996 ) which find that the ratio is never greater than .6 and decreases to .2 in the midplane .",
    "comparison of our observations to this extraplanar ionized gas suggests that the bulk of the emission from the dig we see in m31 is at or near the midplane . in m31 ,",
    "the @xmath33}/i_{h\\alpha}$ ] ratio for all dig brightness levels is .3-.35 .",
    "as this is near the values obtained for the midplane gas in edge - on galaxies , it is reasonable to believe that the bulk of the dig in m31 is likely relatively close to the plane .",
    "similarly , the ratios measured for @xmath6}/i_{h\\alpha}$ ] in m31 are near the low end of the range of values determined by recent narrow band [ oii ] imaging of ngc 55 ( ferguson et al .",
    "1996a ) , roughly .7 in the midplane to as high as 2 at about 1kpc above the disk .",
    "this also supports the idea that the dig observed in m31 has spectral properties consistent with dig near the midplane of edge - on galaxies , although differences in abundance between m31 and ngc 55 may play a role as well .",
    "several emission lines have been observed for the reynolds layer of the milky way ( eg .",
    "reynolds 1984,1985a,1985b , reynolds & tufte 1995 ) .",
    "they are included in table 1 . the emission measures of most of these observations are in the same range as the observations we present here for m31 .",
    "likewise , some of the observed line ratios occupy the same range of values .",
    "for instance , @xmath34}/i_{h\\alpha}$ ] is generally observed to be higher in the milky way , but it is sometimes seen as low , or lower , as in m31 .",
    "noted exceptions are the ratios @xmath7}/i_{h\\beta}$ ] and @xmath45 , which appear lower in the galactic dig than in m31 .",
    "photoionization models account for these differences in line ratios by requiring the dig in the galaxy to be subjected to a more diluted radiation field in comparison to the the dig in m31 .",
    "given that the dig we observed in m31 is located in or near the spiral arms , it is reasonable to assume that the stellar radiation field may be harder in comparison to galactic dig regions due to a higher fraction of direct stellar versus diffuse radiation .",
    "in addition , higher q could imply either higher intensity or somewhat lower @xmath63 ; lower @xmath63 is not likely ( see walterbos & braun 1994 ) .",
    "since the emission measures are similar for both sets of dig , galactic and m31 , it may be that different photoionization environments are important in different dig regions within a galaxy .",
    "testing this hypothesis would require the analysis of dig regions between and within the spiral arms of a nearby spiral galaxy looking for differences in spectroscopic properties at the same dig brightness level .",
    "we have obtained sensitive spectra of representative dig within m31 at four surface brightness levels , ranging from 9 - 59 pc @xmath3 , and of dig specifically selected `` far '' from hii regions . from these spectra , we have measured h@xmath17 , h@xmath38 , h@xmath39 , h@xmath40 , [ nii]@xmath8 , [ sii](@xmath64 ) , [ oiii]@xmath5 , and [ oii]@xmath4 line intensities .",
    "our data represent a more complete set of line observations for dig within the disk of an external galaxy than has been available before .      *",
    "we tentatively detect hei@xmath43 in the average dig spectra with em = 58.4 pc @xmath3 . the observed ratio is @xmath65 implying that helium is nearly 100% singly ionized .",
    "this is in contrast to the upper limits detected for galactic dig , which suggest that helium is predominantly neutral .",
    "the m31 dig regions are located primarily near prominent spiral arms , while the galactic dig regions are not .",
    "one would expect that within dig regions immediately surrounding a spiral arm , the stellar radiation field should be harder compared to dig regions away from spiral arms , in agreement with our results . for fainter dig ,",
    "our he line strength upper limits are consistent with the he being either ionized or neutral . *",
    "the photoionization models of domg@xmath51rgen & mathis ( 1994 ) , appropriate for dig within the galaxy , underpredict the [ oiii ] flux while overpredicting the [ sii ] flux for dig in m31 .",
    "however , a higher q model , where q characterizes the relative importance of the stellar radiation field compared to the diffuse nebular field , is able to reproduce the observations .",
    "the need for the larger q value to fit our observations may not be suprising given that the m31 dig regions are primarily located near spiral arms .",
    "* the observed forbidden line ratios suggest that turbulent mixing ( slavin et al . 1993 ) appears to contribute only a small fraction of the ionization of the dig .",
    "in particular , models that attribute a fraction of the ionization to log(@xmath54)= 5.3 , v=25 km s@xmath59 turbulent mixing and the remaining amount to photoionization , can reasonably well fit the observations of the `` very faint '' dig if the contribution from turbulent mixing is at most about 5% .",
    "the predicted line ratios do not match line ratios for brighter dig levels discussed here .",
    "conversely , log(@xmath54)= 5.0 , v=100 km s@xmath59 turbulent mixing can contribute at most 20% of the ionization of dig , but lower fractions give better fits .",
