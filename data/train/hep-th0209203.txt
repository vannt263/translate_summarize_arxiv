    "the observational evidence for a positive cosmological constant and the proposed de sitter conformal field theory ( ds / cft ) correspondence @xcite have provided motivations for studying the thermodynamics of de sitter spacetime in the presence of black holes @xcite .",
    "since asymptotic de sitter black holes have a cosmological event horizon , one may use a local description of thermodynamics of the event or cosmological horizons separately @xcite .",
    "another way of studying the thermodynamics of these kind of black holes is to investigate their quasilocal thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "one of the quantities associated with the gravitational thermodynamics of black holes is the physical entropy @xmath1 which is proportional to the area of the event horizon(s ) @xcite .",
    "the surprising and impressive features of the area law of entropy is its universality which applies to all kinds of black holes and black strings @xcite , and it also applies to the cosmological event horizon of the asymptotic de sitter black holes @xcite .",
    "another quantity of interest is the temperature @xmath2 , which is proportional to the surface gravity of the event horizon(s ) .",
    "other black hole properties such as energy , angular momentum and conserved charges , can also be given a thermodynamic interpretation @xcite .",
    "but as is known , these quantities typically diverge for asymptotic flat , ads , and ds spacetimes .",
    "a common approach of evaluating them has been to carry out all computations relative to some reference spacetime that is regarded as the ground state for the class of spacetimes of interest @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it suffers from several drawbacks .",
    "the choice of reference spacetime is not always unique @xcite , nor is it always possible to embed a boundary with a given induced metric into the reference background .",
    "indeed , for rotating spacetimes this latter problem creates a serious barrier against calculating the subtraction energy , and calculations have only been performed in the slow - rotating regime @xcite .",
    "an extension of this approach that addresses these difficulties was developed based on the conjectured ads / cft correspondence for asymptotic ads spacetimes @xcite , and recently for asymptotic de sitter spacetimes @xcite . indeed ,",
    "the near - boundary analysis of asymptotically ads spacetimes can be analytically continued to asymptotic ds spacetimes and therefore the counterterms have a straightforward continuation .",
    "it is believed that appending a counterterm , @xmath3 , to the action which depends only on the intrinsic geometry of the boundary(ies ) can remove the divergences .",
    "this requirement , along with general covariance , implies that these terms are functionals of curvature invariants of the induced metric and have no dependence on the extrinsic curvature of the boundary(ies ) .",
    "an algorithmic procedure exists for constructing @xmath3 for asymptotic ads @xcite and ds spacetimes @xcite , and so its determination is unique .",
    "addition of @xmath3  will not affect the bulk equations of motion , thereby eliminating the need to embed the given geometry in a reference spacetime . hence thermodynamic and conserved quantities",
    "can now be calculated intrinsic for any given asymptotically ads or ds spacetime .",
    "the efficiency of this approach has been demonstrated in a broad range of examples for both the asymptotic ads and ds spacetimes @xcite .",
    "recently , we have considered the effects of including @xmath3 for quasilocal gravitational thermodynamics of kerr , kerr - ads and kerr - ds black holes in which the region enclosed by @xmath4 was spatially finite .",
    "we have also performed a quasilocal stability analysis and found phase behavior that was incommensurate with their previous analysis carried out at infinity @xcite . in this paper , we investigate the thermodynamic properties of the class of kerr - newman - ds black holes in the context of both temporally infinite and spatially finite boundaries with the boundary action supplemented by @xmath3 . with their lower degree of symmetry",
    "relative to spherically symmetric black holes , these spacetimes allow for a more detailed study of the consequences of including @xmath3 for temporally infinite and spatially finite boundaries .",
    "there are several reasons for considering this .",
    "first , one can obtain the thermodynamic quantities corresponding to an asymptotically de sitter spacetime within a fixed radius , while there is no self - consistent thermodynamics for the whole spacetime .",
    "furthermore , the inclusion of @xmath3 eliminates the embedding problem from consideration , whether or not the temporary infinite limit is taken , and so it is of interest to see what its impact is on quasilocal thermodynamics .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows .",
    "we review the basic formalism in sec .",

    "we finish our paper with some concluding remarks .",

    "rather than eliminating these divergences by incorporating a reference term in the spacetime , a new term @xmath3 is added to the action that is a functional only of boundary curvature invariants @xcite .",
    "although there may exist a very large number of possible invariants , one could add only a finite number of them in a given dimension .",
    "quantities such as energy , mass , etc . can then be understood as intrinsically defined for a given spacetime , as opposed to being defined relative to some abstract ( and non - unique ) background , although this latter option is still available . in four dimensions",

    "<S> we compute the conserved quantities of the four - dimensional kerr - newman - ds ( knds ) black hole through the use of the counterterm renormalization method , and obtain a generalized smarr formula for the mass as a function of the entropy , the angular momentum and the electric charge . the first law of thermodynamics associated to the cosmological horizon of knds is also investigated . using the minimal number of intrinsic boundary counterterms , </S>",
    "<S> we consider the quasilocal thermodynamics of asymptotic de sitter reissner - nordstrom black hole , and find that the temperature is equal to the product of the surface gravity ( divided by @xmath0 ) and the tolman redshift factor . </S>",
    "<S> we also perform a quasilocal stability analysis by computing the determinant of hessian matrix of the energy with respect to its thermodynamic variables in both the canonical and the grand - canonical ensembles and obtain a complete set of phase diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> we then turn to the quasilocal thermodynamics of four - dimensional kerr - newman - de sitter black hole for virtually all possible values of the mass , the rotation and the charge parameters that leave the quasilocal boundary inside the cosmological event horizon , and perform a quasilocal stability analysis of knds black hole .    _ </S>",
