    "the interest in equilibrium and dynamical properties of flux arrays in type ii superconductors originates both from their technological importance and the rich variety of behavior these systems exhibit under different physical conditions . in a classic paper abrikosov in 1957 @xcite showed that for applied fields @xmath5 such that @xmath6 , the magnetic field penetrates in the form of quantized flux tubes ( @xmath7 ) , which in the absence of disorder form a triangular lattice . in conventional low temperature superconductors , this flux line lattice ( fll ) was believed to exist at all temperatures upto @xmath8 . with the discovery of high @xmath9 superconductors , it was realized that , due to much higher transition temperatures , reduced effective dimensionality and short coherence lengths , fluctuations play an important role in deciding the structure and dynamics of flls @xcite .",
    "one of the most significant consequences of enhanced thermal fluctuations on the fll is its melting into a flux liquid phase via a first order transition @xcite .",
    "disorder arising from vacancies and interstitials , twin boundaries , grain boundaries and columnar pins also modify the structure and dynamics of the vortex lattice .",
    "the presence of strong static disorder is technologically relevant , for it leads to effective pinning of vortices thereby leading to high critical currents @xcite .",
    "it also can lead to novel glassy phases such as the vortex glass and bragg glass for the case of _ random _ quenched disorder @xcite .",
    "columnar defects i.e. linear damaged tracks in the material caused by heavy ion irradiation have emerged as very effective pinning centers @xcite . in order to model the effect of columnar pins on the fll",
    ", we exploit the mapping of 3d interacting flux lines onto bosons in ( 2 + 1)d @xcite . in the mapped quantum problem",
    ", the columnar defects naturally map onto a time - independent random potential for bosons @xcite .",
    "the irreversibility line can be interpreted as a phase transition where the vortex liquid at high temperatures freezes into a _ bose glass _ ( bg ) of vortices pinned by columnar pins at lower temperatures .",
    "path integral monte carlo simulations @xcite find a low temperature bg with patches of ordered region with positional _ and _ orientational order which melts into an entangled defected liquid at high temperatures .",
    "also , when the vortex density and defect densities are equal ( at the matching field @xmath10 ) , each flux line is attached to one pin , leading to a mott insulator ( mi ) phase@xcite .",
    "such a mott insulator has been observed in magnetization relaxation experiments @xcite .    in this paper , we study , using numerical exact diagonalisation on small lattices , the different phases of flux lines with columnar pins for various densities of vortices and disorder strengths .",
    "we consider a lattice of @xmath11-sites with @xmath12 vortices , interacting via a hard core potential .",
    "we model disorder in two ways : ( a ) pinning disorder where a finite fraction of attractive pins , each of strength @xmath1 , are placed randomly ; and ( b ) a random disorder potential at each point . in case ( a )",
    ", we find that an entangled vortex liquid is stable against weak pins . for high pinning strengths ,",
    "a mott insulator is realised when the number of vortices is equal to the number of pins at the matching field @xmath10 .",
    "signatures of a strongly pinned bose glass and a weakly pinned bose glass are also seen as the vortex density is tuned across @xmath10 . in case ( b ) , we find two phases in the density - disorder plane . at low disorder an entangled vortex liquid which localizes into a pinned bose glass with increasing disorder .",

    "as opposed to a bg , the mi is incompressible since the vortex density remains locked to the density of pins over a finite range of external fields @xcite and behaves like a meissner phase with @xmath2 instead of @xmath55 .",

    "note that the origin of this mott insulator ( for @xmath2 ) is different from the mi obtained in the jamming limit ( @xmath62 ) .",

    "we plot binding energy per vortex defined as @xmath68    it is clear that above the matching field ( @xmath10 ) vortices are less bound by disorder than below .",
    "so depending upon the induced @xmath69 , compared with @xmath10 , we find three phases within the bg , namely a strongly pinned bose glass ( sbg for @xmath3 ) , a mott insulator ( for @xmath2 ) , and a weakly pinned bose glass ( wbg for @xmath4 ) , consistent with ref .  @xcite .    in the sbg phase , vortices are collectively pinned by columnar pins @xcite , whereas in the wbg phase , one has patches of ordered regions @xcite .",

    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] that for a higher density of vortices a higher disorder strength is required to prevent entanglement and wandering of the flux - lines .",
    "this happens because with increasing density ( @xmath59 ) , the disorder is effectively screened by vortices ( strongest attractive sites are occupied first ) and a new vortex introduced sees a weaker disorder landscape ; thus is weakly pinned .",
    "therefore , we conjecture that , _ the transition temperature @xmath0 , for a transition from a pinned bose glass to an entangled liquid , will reduce with increasing vortex density_.    =    this conjecture is valid in two regimes in the @xmath101 plane . ( a ) at low fields , where the pinning energy dominates over interaction energy . for example , when the applied field is less than the matching field @xmath10 , columnar pins outnumber vortices and the pinning energy ( @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the diameter of the columnar pin and @xmath104 the coherence length ) dominates over the magnetic repulsion @xcite .",
    "we show this @xmath0 by a solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] .",
    "the transition line we conjecture has a similar shape to the nelson - le doussal line @xcite _ above _ which point - defects play no role in deciding the structure of vortices .",
    "the physical reasons for the origin of nelson - le doussal line and our @xmath0 are very different .",
    "point defects  promote \" flux line wandering and entanglement , whereas correlated disorder  inhibits \" wandering and promotes localization . and",
    "it is precisely this role of columnar pins which leads to the new @xmath0 at low fields .",
    "( b ) at high fields , where vortex bundle pinning dominates over individual vortex pinning @xcite . in our model , since we neglect the long - range part in the inter - vortex interaction , we do not see signatures of vortex bundle pinning at high densities . for the case of vortex - bundle pinning , the screening argument would still hold , and hence the topology of @xmath0 would be the same at high fields .",
    "=    at intermediate fields , the re - entrant  nose \" ( shown by the dashed line in fig .  [ fig:7 ] )",
    "was predicted by nelson  @xcite and has been experimentally verified  @xcite .",
    "we do nt capture this re - entrant part in our simulations since we use an approximate form of the inter - vortex potential .    to conclude , we conjecture a double re - entrant phase diagram . upon decreasing the field near the  nose \"",
    "the vortex liquid localises into a glass where vortex bundles are pinned due to disorder and then delocalizes again into an entangled liquid . at lower fields ,",
    "individual vortices are pinned by columnar defects , giving rise to another disorder dominated glassy phase .",
    "finally we note that , the bosonic hubbard model is a paradigm for studying quantum phase transitions @xcite , in systems such as @xmath105 on random substrates , superconducting disordered thin films @xcite , magnets and josephson - junction arrays @xcite . the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , for example is consistent with the field induced superconductor - insulator ( si ) transition observed in coupled josephson - junction arrays @xcite . in low magnetic fields , vortices at @xmath106 are pinned by disorder introduced via random offset charges . with increasing fields , the vortex density increases and at some critical density , vortices bose - condense@xcite .",
