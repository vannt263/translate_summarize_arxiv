    "the study of small lumps of strange quark matter , called strangelets , plays an important role for research the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) in recent relativistic heavy ion collision ( rhic ) experiments .",
    "the reason is that although many signatures of qgp such as @xmath0 suppression , strangeness enhancement , thermal dilepton electro magnetic radiation , etc .",
    ", have been found @xcite , but it is still ambiguous because these signatures can also be explained by hadron gas @xcite . to search",
    "an unambiguous signature of qgp is the key for rhic experiments .",
    "the strangelet , as was argued by greiner et .",
    "al @xcite , is a good candidate which could serve as an unambiguous signature for the qgp .",
    "the essential problem for detectability of strangelet in rhic experiments is to study its stability during the formation of qgp . employing mit  bag model",
    ", many authors discussed this problem @xcite .",
    "they came to the same conclusion that the electric charge and the strangeness fraction are of vital important to the experimental searches of strangelets because these two elements affect a change of stability remarkably .",
    "but the effect of charge on stability is different for different authors .",
    "jaffe and his co - workers @xcite argued that the strangelet is slightly positive charged .",
    "they considered strong and weak decay by nucleon and hyperon emission together and concluded that the stable strangelets will have a low but positive change to mass ratio .",
    "contrary to jaffe et .",
    "al , after considering the initial condition of possible strangelet production in rhic carefully , greiner and his co - workers @xcite argued that strangelets are most likely highly negative charged .",
    "here we hope to emphasize that above discussions are limited in the framework of mit bag model and at zero temperature .",
    "since the quark deconfinement phase transition can occur at high temperature or / and high density only , it is of interest to extend the investigation for the stability of strangelets to finite temperature .",
    "this is the objective of this paper .",
    "however , mit bag model is a permanent quark confinement model because the confined boundary condition does not change with temperature . in principle",
    ", one can not use this model to study the phase transition of qcd directly .",
    "the best that we can do is to employ a model which can almost reproduce the properties of strange quark matter obtained by mit  bag model , but in which the quark confinement is not permanent .",
    "the quark mass density- and temperature - dependent model ( qmdtd ) @xcite suggested by us is one of such candidates .",
    "many years ago , a quark mass density - dependent model ( qmdd )  was suggested by fowler , raha and weiner @xcite and then it was employed by many authors to discuss the properties of strange quark matter @xcite . according to the qmdd  model ,",
    "the masses of @xmath1 quarks and strange quarks ( and the corresponding anti - quarks ) are given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the baryon number density , @xmath4 is the current mass of the strange quark and @xmath5 is the vacuum energy density . as was proved by ref.@xcite ,",
    "the properties of strange matter in the qmdd  model are nearly the same as those obtained in the mit bag model .",
    "in fact , it is not surprised if one notices that the confinement mechanism of mit  bag model is almost the same as that of qmdd  model @xcite .",
    "but when we employ the qmdd  model to discuss the properties of strangelet , a lot of difficulties emerge @xcite .",
    "at first , the radius of strangelet decreases as the temperature increases ; secondly , it can not mimic the correct phase diagram of qcd because the temperature @xmath6 tends to infinite when @xmath7 . to overcome these difficulties",
    ", we suggest a qmdtdmodel @xcite . instead of a constant @xmath5 in qmdd  model , we argue that @xmath8 is a function of temperature and introduced an ansatz @xcite @xmath9 , 0\\leq t\\leq t_c ,   \\label{15 } \\\\",

    "since @xmath5 is zero when @xmath14 , a condition @xmath15 is imposed and only one parameter @xmath12 can be adjusted . as pointed out by ref.@xcite , in order to satisfy two physical conditions of strangelet at finite temperature , namely , ( 1 ) , the radius of the strangelet must increases when the temperature rises , ( 2 ) , the energy of the strangelet must increases when the temperature rises , the parameter @xmath12 is restricted in a small range : @xmath16    in this paper , we fix the value of two parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 in this suitable range @xmath17 with these parameters set , we use the qmdtd  model to discuss the thermodynamical properties of strangelet , especially , to investigate the stability of strangelet via strong hadron emission and weak hadronic decay .",
    "we will study the effects of temperature , charge and strangeness fraction on the stability and hope that our study can have impact to the detectability of the strangelet .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the following section ,",
    "we give the formulae of thermodynamical calculations for qmdtd  model .",
    "the results of thermodynamical properties of strangelet are presented in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we will discuss the stability of strangelet via possible strong and weak decays .",
    "the last section is a summary .",
    "to calculate the dynamical and thermodynamical quantities of the strangelet , we must look for the density of states first . the density of states of a spherical cavity in which the free particles be contained can be expressed as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total number of particle states and can be written in terms of dimensionless variable @xmath20 as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the radius of the bag .",
    "the three terms of the right hand side of eq.([2 ] ) refer to the contributions of the volume , surface and curvature , respectively .",
    "the coefficients @xmath23 , @xmath5 and @xmath24 are expected to be very slow varying functions of @xmath20 , and their expressions are model dependent . for mit bag model ,",

    "the curvature term @xmath24 can not be evaluated by this theory except for the two limiting case : @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "madsen proposed that @xcite @xmath31 but as was pointed out by ref.@xcite , the beat fit of numerical data for curvature term is @xmath32    now we are in the position to calculate the thermodynamical quantities of strangelets for qmdtd model .",

    "then the thermodynamic potential , free energy and the stable radius of the strangelet at finite temperature can be obtained self - consistently .",
    "the numerical calculations have been done with the parameters set :    @xmath63    and the possible area for strangelet in our calculations is chosen as @xmath64 we calculate the free energy of the strangelet first .",

    "these results are similar to that one given by @xcite .",

    "the stable radiuses given by eq.([13 ] ) for different strangeness are different .",

    "therefore , we come to a conclusion that the stable radius of strangelet decreases when @xmath53 increases .    to illustrate the charge dependence of the stable radius , we draw @xmath65 vs @xmath94 curves with fixed @xmath67 , @xmath91 and @xmath69 but different electric charge @xmath95 and @xmath96 in figure 7 , respectively . the stable radius increases from @xmath85 to @xmath97 when the electric charge rises from @xmath98 to @xmath96 .",

    "in this section , we follow the line of ref.@xcite to investigate the stability of the strangelet and extend their study to finite temperature by using the qmdtd  model .      as was pointed out by refs.@xcite , small clusters of strange matter are most favoured for detection . as two examples ,",
    "hereafter we study two cases with @xmath67 and @xmath103 , respectively .    instead of the binding energy at zero temperature , we calculate the free energy per baryon of the possible strangelet at finite temperature first .",
    "figure 9 and 10 show the free energy per baryon of all possible strangelets as a function of the strangeness @xmath53 at the temperature @xmath69 but for @xmath67 and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "the solid lines in these two figures connect the masses of the nucleon , @xmath104 and @xmath33 . as a first cut for potential candidates of stable strangelets , these ones lying above this line can ( or probably will ) completely decay to the pure hadron state via strong processes , and only these ones beneath the line will be possible for metastable or stable strangelets @xcite .",
    "we consider the influence of temperature now . as shown in last section , the free energy per baryon increases when temperature decreases .",
    "the positions of the dots will raise and many dots will across the line and become unstable when temperature decreases .",
    "figure 11 shows this result clearly .",
    "the figure 11 is the same as figure 9 except for temperature @xmath68 .",
    "comparing these two figures , we find many dots across the line when temperature decreases from @xmath105 to @xmath106 . at low temperature",
    ", more strangelets can decay to the pure hadronic state by strong process .    here",
    "we must emphasize that although any strangelet initially formed under this line can not decay to a pure hadron state , it is still possibly unstable because it can decay to a hadron and another strangelet changing baryon number , strangeness number and charge @xcite .",
    "we will look for possible strong decays , i.e. single baryon \\{n , p , @xmath107 and @xmath33 } emission and mesonic decays at the finite size configuration at finite temperature .",

    "for @xmath114 and @xmath115 all strangelets including the ones lying above the lines of figure 9 and the ones which satisfy the inequality ( [ 29 ] ) are drawn by the circles in figure 12 .",
    "these strangelets can strong decay and are unstable .",
    "the unstable strangelets for @xmath103 and @xmath69 are drawn by circle in figure 13 .",
    "figure 12 and figure 13 show that the strangelets with small strangeness number @xmath53 and situated in the left side of the figure are unstable .    to study the temperature effect , the same figure for @xmath67 and @xmath116",
    "are shown in figure 14 . comparing figure 12 and",
    "figure 14 , we find that many strangelets become unstable when temperature decreases .",
    "lower temperature is in favour of the strong decay of the strangelet .      according to the definition of greiner et .",
    "al @xcite ,  a strangelet is called metastable in the following if its energy lies under the correspond ( free ) hadronic matter of the same baryon number , charge and strangeness , and if it can not emit a single hadron or multiple hadrons by strong processes .  at finite temperature , instead of energy , we use free energy .",
    "a metastable strangelet can then only decay via weak process like the nonleptonic ( hadronic ) decays . in this sub - section ,",
    "we study all possible weak hadronic decay for metastable strangelets .    in the weak process",
    ", the baryon number @xmath23 and the electric charge @xmath56 are conserved , but the strangeness number @xmath53 is not conserved .",
    "for the weak decay , @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , a general expression of a weak baryon decay for a strangelet @xmath108 can be written as @xmath118 this process is allowed if the free energy balance of the corresponding reaction is @xmath119    the metastable strangelets which satisfy the inequality ( [ 31 ] ) are shown in figure 12 , 13 and 14 with filled circle .",
    "we find that they are almost situated in the area with negative charge ( or slightly positive charge ) and high strangeness number .",
    "in particular , high strangeness is in favour of the stability of strangelet . as shown in figures 12 , 13 and 14 , a minimal strangeness @xmath120 above which ( @xmath121 ) strangelets are metastable or stable exists .",
    "the values of the minimal strangeness @xmath120 are @xmath122 in figure 12 ( @xmath123 ) and @xmath124 in figure 13 ( @xmath125 ) . defining strangeness fraction @xmath126 as @xmath127 greiner and his co",
    "- workers had predicted that there exists a critical @xmath128at zero temperature and pointed that the metastable or stable strangelets could only be found above this value @xmath129our results strongly support their prediction and extend it to the finite temperature .",
    "we obtained @xmath130 at @xmath69 .",
    "this value does not depend on the baryon numbers .",
    "but as shown in figure 14 , @xmath131 depends on the temperature .",
    "it becomes @xmath132 at @xmath68 .",
    "now we turn to discuss the charge dependence of the stability of strangelet .",
    "as shown in figures 12 , 13 and 14 , higher negative charge is in favour of the metastable and/or stable strangelets . a maximal charge , which is @xmath133 in figure 12 ( @xmath134 ) , @xmath135 in figure 13 ( @xmath136 ) and @xmath137 in figure 13 ( @xmath138 ) , respectively , exists .",
    "the strangelets would be stable or metastable when @xmath139 .",
    "defining charge fraction @xmath140 as @xmath141 we find that the maximal charge fraction depends on not only the temperature but also the baryon number @xmath23 .",
    "for example , @xmath142 equals to @xmath143 for @xmath67 and @xmath144 for @xmath103 when @xmath69 .",
    "the strangelet which is stable against both strong and weak decay is called stable strangelet .",
    "the stable strangelets are shown in figure 12 , 13 and 14 by filled squares .",
    "we find that only a few strangelets can not decay via strong and weak reactions and be completely stable .",
    "for example , as shown in figure 12 , for @xmath67 and @xmath69 , in total @xmath145 strangelets , only @xmath146 strangelets are stable ( @xmath147 ) , ( @xmath148 ) , ( @xmath149 ) and ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "finally , we hope to emphasize that the high negative charge and the high strangeness are in favour of the stable strangelets obviously at finite temperature .",
    "the stable strangelets in figures 12 , 13 and 14 are all highly negative charged .",
    "the conclusion given by greiner et .",
    "al at zero temperature @xcite is still correct at finite temperature .",
    "in summary , by using the qmdtd  model , we have studied the thermodynamical properties and the stability of strangelets at finite temperature .",
    "we obtain :    ( 1 ) , for fixed strangeness and charge , free energy per baryon decreases as the temperature increases .",
    "the stable radius of the strangelet decreases when the strangeness increases or the charge decreases .",
    "( 2 ) , the higher temperature is in favour of the stability of the strangelets . comparing figure 12 with figure 14 , we see clearly that the total area of metastable and stable strangelets expands when the temperature increases .",
    "( 3 ) , the higher negative charge and higher strangeness number are in favour of the stability of the strangelets .",
    "the stable strangelets are highly negative charged and have high strangeness .",
