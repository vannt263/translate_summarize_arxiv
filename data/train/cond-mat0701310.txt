    "high temperature superconductivity ( htsc ) is one of the most intriguing phenomena in modern solid state physics .",
    "experimentally , htsc is observed in layered cuprate compounds .",
    "the undoped cuprates are antiferromagnetically ordered insulators which develop the characteristic superconducting `` dome '' upon doping with charge carriers .",
    "htsc is interesting not only for promising technological applications , but also from a theoretical point of view .",
    "the relevant ingredients for htsc are believed to be the following .    *",
    "low dimensionality ( 2d ) .",
    "* strong short - range repulsion between electrons .",
    "* doped mott insulator .    taking these 3 ingredients ,",
    "htsc is modeled in the tight - binding description by large-@xmath2 hubbard models or @xmath0-@xmath1 models on the square lattice : @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the gutzwiller projector @xmath7 prevents electrons from occupying the same lattice site .",
    "the non - perturbative nature of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model makes it an outstanding problem to solve in dimensions larger than one .",
    "analytical techniques ( renormalized or slave - boson mean - field theories @xcite ) are very crude and numerical techniques ( e.g.  exact diagonalization or cluster dmft ) are restricted to very small clusters or infinite dimensions , or they fail on the sign problem ( qmc ) .",
    "an alternative approach was suggested by anderson shortly after the experimental discovery of htsc , when he proposed a gutzwiller - projected bcs wave function as superconducting ground state for cuprates @xcite . following this conjecture ,",
    "many variational studies have been performed on the basis of what is called anderson s ( long range ) rvb state .",
    "this state turned out to have very low variational energy , close to exact ground state energies , as well as high overlap with the true ground states of small @xmath0-@xmath1 clusters @xcite . on the other hand , many experimental facts about cuprate superconductors can be reproduced and are consistent with the variational results : e.g.  clearly favored @xmath8-wave pairing symmetry , doping dependency of the nodal fermi velocity and the nodal quasiparticle weight .",
    "many of these successful efforts following anderson s proposal are summarized in the `` plain vanilla rvb theory '' of htsc , recently reviewed in @xcite .    with help of the relatively recent technique of angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) , experimentalists can probe the electronic structure of low - lying excitations inside the copper planes .",
    "the intensity measured in arpes is proportional to the one  particle electronic spectral function : @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to explore spectral properties within the framework of gutzwiller - projected variational quasiparticle ( qp ) excitations .    in this contribution we will discuss some of our results reported in @xcite . for more details , in particular for more reference to experimental studies , we invite the reader to consult that paper .",

    "note that in the rvb theory , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are variational parameters without direct physical significance ; physical quantities like excitation gap , superconducting order , or chemical potential must be calculated explicitly .",
    "the spectral weights of the coherent low - lying quasiparticles can be written as    [ eq : weights]@xmath26    these weights are measured in arpes experiments as the residues of the spectral function @xmath27 @xcite . note that in conventional bcs - theory , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    ", we can then derive the spectral weights .",

    "the spectral weight reduction is much smaller and the electron - hole asymmetry decreases . * since there is no electron - hole mixing along the zone diagonal ( @xmath8-wave ) , the spectral weights @xmath35 and @xmath46 have a discontinuity at the nodal point .",

    "there are , however , several experimental definitions of the fs .",

    "the various definitions of the fs usually agree within the experimental uncertainties @xcite .",
    "the different definitions of the fs in htsc were recently analyzed theoretically in refs .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    ", we propose an alternative definition of the fermi surface based on the ground state equal - time green s functions . in the unprojected bcs state , the underlying fs is determined by the condition @xmath72",
    ". we will refer to this as the _ unprojected fs_. since @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the residues of the qp poles in the bcs theory , it is natural to replace them in the interacting case by @xmath35 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "we will therefore define the _ effective fs _ as the locus @xmath75 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nfs ] , we plot the unprojected and the effective fs which we obtained from vmc calculations .",
    "the contour plot of the total qp weight is also shown .",
    "it is interesting to note the following points .",
    "* in the underdoped region , the effective fs is open and bent outwards ( hole - like fs ) . in the overdoped region ,",
    "the effective fs closes and embraces more and more the unprojected one as doping is increased ( electron - like fs ) . *",
    "luttinger s rule @xcite is clearly violated in the underdoped region , i.e.  the area enclosed by the effective fs is not conserved by the interaction ; it is larger than that of the unprojected fs .",
    "* in the optimally doped and overdoped region , the total spectral weight is approximately constant along the effective fs within errorbars . in the highly underdoped region",
    ", we observe a small concentration of the spectral weight around the nodal point ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "large `` hole - like '' fs in underdoped cuprates has also been reported in arpes experiments by several groups @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that a negative next - nearest hopping @xmath77 would lead to a similar fs curvature as we find in the underdoped region .",
    "we would like to emphasize that our original @xmath0-@xmath1 hamiltonian as well as the variational states do not contain any @xmath77 .",
    "our results show that the outward curvature of the fs is due to strong repulsion , without need of @xmath77 .",
    "the next - nearest hopping terms in the microscopic description of the cuprates may not be necessary to explain the fs topology found in arpes experiments .",
    "remarkably , if the next - nearest hopping @xmath77 is included in the variational ansatz ( and not in the original @xmath0-@xmath1 hamiltonian ) , a finite and negative @xmath77 is generated , as it was shown in ref .",
    "apparently , in this case the unprojected fs has the tendency to adjust to the effective fs .",
    "a similar bending of the fs was also reported in the recent analysis of the current carried by gutzwiller - projected qps @xcite .",
    "a high - temperature expansion of the momentum distribution function @xmath78 of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model was done in ref .",
    "@xcite where the authors find a violation of luttinger s rule and a negative curvature of the fs .",
    "our findings provide further evidence in this direction .",
    "a natural question is the role of superconductivity in the unconventional bending of the fs . in the limit @xmath79 , the variational states are gutzwiller - projected excitations of the fermi sea and the spectral weights are step - functions at the ( unprojected ) fs . in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", it was shown that @xmath80 for the projected fermi - sea , which means that the unprojected and the effective fs coincide in that case .",
    "this suggests that the `` hole - like '' fs results from a non - trivial interplay between strong correlation and superconductivity . at the moment",
    ", we lack a qualitative explanation of this effect .",
    "however , it may be a consequence of the proximity of the system to the non - superconducting `` staggered - flux '' state @xcite or to antiferromagnetism near half - filling @xcite .",
