    "the conceptual simplicity of a _ network _  a set of nodes , some pairs of which connected by edges  often suffices to capture the essence of cooperation in complex systems .",
    "ever since barabsi and albert presented their evolving network model @xcite , in which linear preferential attachment leads asymptotically to a scale - free degree distribution ( the degree , @xmath0 , of a node being its number of neighbouring nodes ) , there have been many variations or refinements to the original scenario @xcite ( for a review , see @xcite ) . in @xcite , we showed how topological phase transitions and scale - free solutions could emerge in the case of nonlinear rewiring in fixed - size networks .",
    "now we extend our scope to more general and realistic situations , considering the evolution of networks making only minimal assumptions about the attachment / detachment rules .",
    "in fact , all we assume is that these probabilities factorize into two parts : a local term which depends on node degree , and a global term , which is a function of the mean degree of the network",
    ".    our motivation can be found in the mechanisms behind many real - world networks , but we focus , for the sake of illustration , on the development of biological neural networks , where nodes represent neurons and edges play the part of synaptic interaction @xcite .",
    "experimental neuroscience has shown that enhanced electric activity induces synaptic growth and dendritic arborization @xcite .",
    "since the activity of a neuron depends on the net current received from its neighbours , which is higher the more neighbours it has , we can see node degree as a proxy for this activity  accounting for the local term alluded to above .",
    "on the other hand , synaptic growth and death also depend on concentrations of various molecules , which can diffuse through large areas of tissue and therefore can not in general be considered local .",
    "a feature of brain development in many animals is _",
    "synaptic pruning _  the large reduction in synaptic density undergone throughout infancy .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that via an elimination of less needed synapses , this can reduce the energy consumed by the brain ( which in a human at rest can account for a quarter of total energy used ) while maintaining near optimal memory performance . going on this , we will take the mean degree of the network  or mean synaptic density  to reflect total energy consumption , hence the global terms in our attachment / detachment rules .",
    "an alternative approach would be to consider some kind of model neurons explicitely and couple the probabilities of synaptic growth and death to neuronal dynamic variables , such as local and global fields . in a hopfield network , for example , the expected value of the field ( total incoming current ) at node @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath1 s degree @xcite , the total current ( energy consumption ) in the network therefore being proportional to the mean degree ; qualitatively , these observations are likely to hold also in more realistic situations @xcite , although relations need not be linear .",
    "co - evolving networks of this sort are currently attracting attention , with dynamics such as prisoner s dilemma @xcite , voter model @xcite or random walkers @xcite .",
    "although we consider this line of work particularly interesting , for generality and analytical tractability we opt here to use only topological information for the attachment / detachment rules , although our results can be applied to any situation in which the dynamical states of the elements at the nodes can be functionally related to degrees .    following a brief general analysis",
    ", we show how appropriate choices of functions induce the system to evolve towards heterogeneous ( sometimes scale - free ) networks while undergoing synaptic pruning in quantitative agreement with experiments . at the same time ,",
    "degree - degree correlations emerge naturally , thus making the resulting networks _ disassortative _  as tends to be the case for most biological networks  and leading to realistic small - world parameters .",
    "consider a simple undirected network with @xmath2 nodes defined by the adjacency matrix @xmath3 , the element @xmath4 representing the existence or otherwise of an edge between nodes @xmath1 and @xmath5 .",
    "each node can be characterized by its degree , @xmath6 .",
    "initially , the degrees follow some distribution @xmath7 with mean @xmath8 .",
    "we wish to study the evolution of networks in which nodes can gain or lose edges according to stochastic rules which only take into account local and global information on degrees .",
    "so as to implement this in the most general way , we will assume that at every time step , each node has a probability of gaining a new edge , @xmath9 to a random node ; and a probability of losing a randomly chosen edge , @xmath10 we assume these factorize as @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be arbitrary functions , but impose nothing else other than normalization .",
    "for each edge that is withdrawn from the network , two nodes decrease in degree : @xmath1 , chosen according to @xmath17 , and @xmath5 , a random neighbour of @xmath1 s ; so there is an added effective probability of loss @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , for each edge placed in the network , not only @xmath19 chosen according to @xmath20 increases its degree ; a random node @xmath21 will also gain , with the consequent effective probability @xmath22 ( though see and @xmath23 , which in any case would disappear if self - connections were allowed . ] ) .",
    "let us introduce the notation @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "network evolution can now be seen as a _ one step process _",
    "@xcite with transition rates @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",

    "this condition ( sufficient for ( [ eq1 ] ) to be zero ) can be written as @xmath33 p_{\\mbox{\\small{st}}}(k),\\label{eq2}%\\ ] ] where we have substituted a difference for a partial derivative and @xmath34 . setting @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    "so as to be normalized to one ( i.e. , @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) , which is equivalent to saying that at each time step exactly @xmath37 nodes are chosen to gain edges and @xmath38 to lose them , then in the stationary state we will have @xmath39 since the total number of edges will be conserved . from ( [ eq2 ] ) * *  * * we can see that @xmath31 will have an extremum at some value @xmath40 if it satisfies @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath40 will be a maximum ( minimum ) if the numerator in ( [ eq2 ] ) is smaller ( greater ) than the denominator for @xmath42 , and viceversa for @xmath43 .",
    "assuming , for example , that there is one and only one such @xmath40 , then a maximum implies a relatively homogeneous distribution , while a minimum means @xmath31 will be split in two , and therefore highly heterogeneous .",
    "more intuitively , if for nodes with large enough @xmath0 there is a higher probability of gaining edges than of losing them , the degrees of these nodes will grow indefinitely , leading to heterogeneity .",
    "if , on the other hand , highly connected nodes always lose more edges than they gain , we will obtain quite homogeneous networks . from this reasoning",
    "we can see that a particularly interesting case ( which turns out to be critical ) is that in which @xmath44 and @xmath45 are such that @xmath46 according to ( [ eq2 ] ) , condition ( [ condition ] ) means that for large @xmath0 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 flattens out  as for example a power - law does .",

    "\\label{diff_drift}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ignoring boundary conditions , the stationary solution must satisfy , on the one hand , @xmath51 so that the diffusion is stationary , and , on the other , @xmath52 to cancel out the drift .",
    "for this situation to be reachable from any initial condition , @xmath37 and @xmath38 must be monotonous functions , decreasing and increasing respectively .",
    "as a simple example , we will first consider global probabilities which have the linear forms : @xmath53=\\frac{n}{n}\\left (   1-\\frac{\\kappa(t)}{\\kappa_{\\mbox{\\small{max}}}% } \\right ) \\quad \\mbox { and } \\quad d[\\kappa(t)]=\\frac{n}{n}\\frac{\\kappa(t)}{\\kappa _ { \\mbox{\\small{max}}}},\\label{u_d_linear}%\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the expected value of the number of additions and deletions of edges per time step , and @xmath55 is the maximum value the mean degree can have .",
    "this choice describes a situation in which the higher the density of synapses , the less likely new ones are to sprout and the more likely existing ones are to atrophy  a situation that might arise , for instance , in the presence of a finite quantity of nutrients . again taking into account that @xmath15 and @xmath16 are normalized to one , summing over @xmath56 we find that the increment in @xmath8 is @xmath57-d[\\kappa(t)]\\rbrace=2(n / n)\\left [   1 - 2\\kappa(t)/\\kappa_{\\mbox{\\small{max}}}% \\right ]   $ ] ( independently of the local probabilities ) .",
    "therefore , the mean degree will increase or decrease exponentially with time , from @xmath58 to @xmath59 . assuming that the initial condition is , say , @xmath60 , and expressing the solution in terms of the _ mean synaptic density _ ",
    "i.e. , @xmath61 with @xmath62 the total volume considered  we have @xmath63 where we have defined @xmath64 and the time constant for pruning is @xmath65 .",

    "the inset in figure [ fig_exp ] shows the best fit to the auditory cortex data . since the contour conditions @xmath74 and ( for ( [ rho_t2]))f @xmath71 are simply taken as the value of the last data point and the time of the first one , in each case , the time constants @xmath75 and @xmath73 are the only parameters needed for the fit .

    "the drift - like evolution of the mean degree we have just illustrated with the example of synaptic pruning is independent of the local probabilities @xmath44 and @xmath45 . the effect of these is rather in the diffusive behaviour which can lead , as mentioned , either to homogeneous or to heterogeneous final states .",
    "a useful bounded order parameter to characterize these phases is therefore @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the variance of the degree distribution ( @xmath78 represents an average over nodes ) .",
    "we will use @xmath79 to distinguish between the different phases , since @xmath80 for a regular network and @xmath81 for one following a highly heterogeneous distribution .",
    "although there are particular choices of probabilities which lead to ( [ diff_drift ] ) , these are not the only critical cases , since the transition from homogeneous to heterogeneous stationary states can come about also with functions which never meet condition ( [ condition ] ) .",
    "rather , this is a classic topological phase transition , the nature of which depends on the choice of functions @xcite .",
    "evolution of the degree distribution is shown in figure [ fig_ab ] for critical and supercritical choices for the probabilities , as given by mc simulations ( starting from regular random graphs ) and contrasted with theory .",
    "( the subcritical regime is not shown since the stationary state has a distribution similar to the ones at @xmath82 mcs in the other regimes . )",
    "the disparity between the theory and the simulations for the final distributions is due to the build up of certain correlations not taken into account in our analysis .",
    "this is because the existence of some very highly connected nodes reduces the probability of there being very low degree nodes . in particular ,",
    "if there are , say , @xmath83 nodes connected to the rest of the network , then a natural cutoff , @xmath84 , emerges .",
    "note that this occurs only when we restrict ourselves to simple networks , i.e. , with only one edge allowed for each pair of nodes .",
    "this topological phase transition is shown in figure [ fig_fss ] , where @xmath85 is plotted against parameter @xmath86 for global probabilities as in ( [ u_d_linear ] ) and local ones @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "this situation corresponds to one in which edges are eliminated randomly while nodes have a power - law probability of sprouting new ones ( note that power - laws are good descriptions of a variety of monotonous response functions , yet only require one parameter ) .",
    "[ th ! ]",
    "fig3.eps    although , to our knowledge , there are not yet enough empirical data to ascertain what degree distribution the structural topology of the human brain follows , it is worth noting that its functional topology , at the level of brain areas , has been found to be scale - free with an exponent very close to @xmath89 @xcite .    in general",
    ", most other measures can be expected to undergo a transition along with its variance .",
    "for instance , highly heterogeneous networks ( such as scale - free ones ) exhibit the small - world property , characterized by a high _ clustering coefficient , _",
    "@xmath90 , and a low _ mean minimum path , _",
    "@xmath91 @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting topological feature of a network is its _ synchronizability _ ",
    "i.e. , given a set of oscillators placed at the nodes and coupled via the edges , how wide a range of coupling strengths will result in them all becoming synchronized .",
    "barahona and pecora showed analytically that , for linear oscillators , a network is more synchronizable the lower the relation @xmath92  where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the highest and lowest non - zero eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix ( @xmath95 ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "the bottom left inset in figure [ fig_fss ] displays the values of @xmath96 and @xmath93 obtained for the different stationary states .",
    "there is a peak in @xmath96 at the critical point .",
    "it has been argued that this tendency of heterogeneous topologies to be particularly unsynchronizable poses a paradox given the wide prevalence of scale - free networks in nature , a problem that has been deftly got around by considering appropriate weighting schemes for the edges @xcite ( see also , and @xcite for a review ) .",
    "however , there is no generic reason why high synchronizability should always be desirable .",
    "in fact , it has recently been shown that heterogeneity can improve the dynamical performance of model neural networks precisely because the fixed points are easily destabilised @xcite ( as well as conferring robustness to thermal fluctuations and improving storage capacity @xcite ) .",
    "this makes intuitive sense , since , presumably , one would not usually want all the neurons in one s brain to be doing exactly the same thing .",
    "therefore , this point of maximum _ unsynchronizability _ at the phase transition may be a particularly advantageous one .    on the whole",
    ", we find that three classes of network  homogeneous , scale - free ( at the critical point ) and ones composed of starlike structures , with a great many small - degree nodes connected to a few hubs  can emerge for any kind of attachment / detachment rules .",
    "it follows that a network subject to some sort of optimising mechanism , such as natural selection for the case of living systems , could thus evolve towards whichever topology best suits its requirements by tuning these microscopic actions .",
    "most real networks have been found to exhibit degree - degree correlations , also known as _ mixing _ by degree @xcite .",
    "they can thus be classified as _ assortative _ , when the degree of a typical node is positively correlated with that of its neighbours , or _",
    "disassortative , _ when the correlation is negative .",

    "whether biological , technological or information - related , seem to be generically disassortative .",
    "the top right inset in figure [ fig_fss ] displays the stationary value of @xmath103 obtained in the same networks as in the main panel and lower inset .",
    "it turns out that the heterogeneous regime is disassortative , the more so the larger @xmath86 .",
    "( note that a completely homogeneous network can not have degree - degree correlations , since all degrees are the same . )",
    "it is known that the restriction of having at most one edge per pair of nodes induces disassortativity @xcite .",

    "the nearest - neighbour - degree function is now @xmath129 ( a decreasing function for any @xmath86 ) , with the result that pearson s coefficient becomes @xmath130    more generally , one can understand the emergence of these correlations in the following way . for the network to become heterogeneous",
    ", we must have @xmath131 for large enough @xmath0 , so that highly connected nodes do not lose more edges than they can acquire ( see section [ sec_basic ] ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath44 must be increasing and approximately linear or superlinear .",
    "the expected value of the degree of a node @xmath1 , chosen according to @xmath132 , is then @xmath133 , while that of its new , randomly chosen neighbour , @xmath5 , is only @xmath134 .",
    "this induces disassortative correlations which can never be compensated by the breaking of edges between nodes whose expected degree values are @xmath135 and @xmath136 if @xmath45 is an increasing function .",
    "it thus ensues that a scenario such as the one analysed in this paper will never lead to assortative networks except for some cases in which @xmath45 is a decreasing function  meaning that less connected nodes should be more likely to lose edges .",
    "assortativity could , however , arise if there were some bias also on the node chosen to be @xmath1 s neighbour , e.g. on the postsynaptic neuron  which is precisely what happens in most social networks , where individuals do not generally choose their friends , partners , etc . randomly .",
    "although there seem to be other reasons for the ubiquity of disassortative networks in nature @xcite , it is possible that the generality of the scenario studied here may also play a part .",
    "we can use the expected value matrix @xmath137 to estimate other magnitudes .",
    "for example , the clustering coefficient , as defined by watts and strogatz @xcite , is an average over nodes of @xmath138 , with @xmath138 the proportion of @xmath1 s neighbours which are connected to each other ; so its expected value is @xmath139 conditioned to @xmath5 and @xmath19 being neighbours of @xmath1 s .",

    "there exists a biological neural network which has been entirely mapped ( although not , to the best of our knowledge , at different stages of development )  that of the much - investigated worm _ c. elegans _ @xcite . with a view to testing",

    "furthermore , as is displayed in table [ table_celegans ] , the clustering coefficient obtained in simulation is almost the same as the empirical one .",
    "the mean minimum path is similar though slightly smaller in simulation , probably due to the worm s brain having modules related to functions @xcite . finally , pearson s coefficient is also in fairly good agreement , although the simulated networks are actually a bit more disassortative .",
    "it should , however , be stressed that the simulation results are for averages over @xmath157 runs , while the biological system is equivalent to a single run ; given the small number of neurons , statistical fluctuations can be fairly large , so one should refrain from attributing too much importance to the precise values obtained  at least until we can average over @xmath157 worms .",
