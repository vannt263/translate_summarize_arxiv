    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that brown dwarfs are as numerous as hydrogen - burning stars .",
    "observations indicate that a large percentage of young bds are surrounded by circumstellar disks @xcite .",
    "mid - infrared , submillimetre and millimetre measurements have characterized the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the bd disks @xcite , revealing the accretion rate and ongoing evolution of the young bd disks .",
    "the decreasing trend of ir excess in seds with age suggests that bd disks evolve from flared to flat geometry , similar to the evolution of disks surrounding large stars @xcite .",
    "a t - tauri phase has been detected via broad @xmath0 lines in many of these young disks @xcite ) , sometimes associated with bipolar outflows @xcite .",
    "giant planets have also been imaged orbiting brown dwarfs @xcite .    while the observational results admit the possibility that brown dwarfs share a common origin with stars ( i.e. from the gravitational collapse of molecular cloud cores ) , the theory of the bd formation is far from well established .",
    "bd masses ( @xmath1 ) are smaller than the typical jeans mass in the parent clouds ( @xmath2 ) by more than an order of magnitude which seems to work against direct collapse of clumps as a formation mechanism .",
    "approaches to solving this problem include lowering the jeans mass via regions of low temperature @xcite or via density enhancements in turbulent flows @xcite ( `` turbulent fragmentation '' ) .",
    "after low mass objects form ongoing mass accretion determines the final imf .",
    "it has been proposed that all objects initially form with low masses and that observed bds are those objects ejected from the gas cloud reservoir before they grow to stellar mass ( `` competitive accretion '' ) @xcite .",
    "here we investigate a complementary mechanism of brown dwarf formation : instead of producing sub - stellar object in large numbers directly , we start by using the fact that initial cloud core - collapse stage forms numerous stellar mass objects with extended protostellar disks .",
    "such early disks are very flared and for this study they are assumed to be stable against spontaneous fragmentation .",
    "however , encounters between extended disks are very violent and can trigger gravitational instabilities and the formation of substellar objects .",
    "since the gas density in a disk is much higher than an early - stage core , the local jeans mass is comparable to a substellar mass , making it possible for gravitational collapse to produce objects that range down to planetary masses .",
    "the encounter picture has been studied previously by @xcite and @xcite with low resolution simulations using proto - stars with flat disks ( two dimensional ) or disks with highly - simplified vertical structure , respectively .",
    "the formation of substellar - mass objects was reported by both groups but it was not clear if the fragmentation was real or numerical or what the detailed properties of the objects might be .",
    "it is also worth noting that encounters occur in gaseous simulations of star cluster formation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , modelling many hundreds of solar masses at once forces a compromise on the the mass resolution in individual proto - stellar disks and approximations ( such as unusually low mass clusters or very large sink radii , discussed in the next section ) have been necessary .    in this letter",
    "we report the results of new , high - resolution pairwise encounter simulations with realistic protostellar disk models and a range of initial configurations .",
    "we discuss the conditions under which fragmentation can occur and , in the cases where objects form , we examine their shapes , rotation and orbital properties and discuss their observational implications .",
    "the parallel treesph code `` gasoline '' @xcite was used to simulate the encounters of protostellar disks .",
    "the initial conditions employed flared disk models @xcite consistent with the observations of early stellar objects .",
    "each disk extended from 50 to @xmath3 au and had mass @xmath4 , comparable to the mass of the central protostar ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the radial surface density and temperature profiles were chosen to be similar to the intermediate quasi - static results of core - collapse simulations by @xcite .",
    "the dependence is flat inside 100 au and then varies as @xmath6 until it falls off rapidly beyond 500 - 700 au .",
    "the gas temperature was fixed according to the distance to the nearest protostar as @xmath7 @xcite and smoothly transitioned to the ambient temperature of @xmath8 k at @xmath9 au .",
    "this temperature profile is similar to that of @xcite which self - consistently included heating due to stellar irradiation , viscosity and shock waves which are beyond current simulation capabilities for non - axisymmetric simulations .",
    "based on yorke s surface density and using the @xcite opacities the disks are optically thin outside clumps and cool efficiently .",
    "the product of the angular rotation rate and the cooling time @xmath10 = 0.3 - 0.7 which is well within the required range for fragmentation for a molecular hydrogen disk of @xmath11 @xcite . given the importance of heating and the extremely short cooling time ( @xmath12 years at 100 au ) it",
    "was felt that a fixed temperature distribution was most appropriate for the protostellar disks .",
    "better treatment of the thermal conditions will be required for interior evolution of the brown dwarf clumps being pursued in future work .",
    "vertical structure is one of the key factors affecting disk stability , lowering the critical toomre @xmath13 value to values as low as @xmath14 for extremely flared disks @xcite . following arguments by @xcite and @xcite and experimentation with different @xmath13 values ( * ?",
    "* in preparation ) , we selected an initial @xmath15 that is comfortably in the stable region for the simulations presented here .",
    "the disk vertical structure was constructed self - consistently assuming the gas to be in hydrostatic equilibrium with both its own global self - gravity and the star gravity .",
    "the scale heights in the midplane are quite large ( @xmath16 au at the densest point at @xmath17 au ) and well resolved ( local sph smoothing 1.9 au ) and decrease above the mid - plane . the velocities were set to maintain circular orbits .",
    "each disk was modeled with 200,000 sph particles with masses of @xmath18 ( 1 earth mass ) .",
    "an unresolved jeans mass can result in artificial fragmentation @xcite .",
    "this resolution ensured that both the local jeans mass and the vertical structure were resolved until well after any initial fragmentation that forms clumps .",
    "the disks were tested to be initially stable against spontaneous fragmentation .",
    "the artificial shock - capturing viscosity had no dynamical effect ( measured viscous timescales of @xmath19 years ) .",
    "the encounter timescale ( @xmath20 years ) is too short for physical viscous effects to play an important role .",
    "the protostars the stars were treated as sink particles @xcite with radii of 1 au but no new sink particles were added during the runs .",
    "the softening length of gravitational force was chosen to be 0.2 au , one tenth of the minimum initial spacing .",
    "thus densities up to 1000 times larger than the highest densities in the initial disk were well treated numerically .",
    "the softening was expected to inhibit extremely low - mass fragmentation near the resolution limit .",
    "pairs of disks were placed on initially unbound orbital trajectories with a projected impact parameter of @xmath21 au ( prior to gravitational focusing ) .",
    "various disk spin orientations ( with respect to the angular momentum of the orbit ) were run , covering prograde cases ( spin - orbit angle less than @xmath22 ) , retrograde cases ( spin - orbit angle larger than @xmath22 ) and combinations of the two .",
    "the simulation results support the main conclusion of the previous studies : the formation of bds can be triggered by protostellar disk encounters .",
    "however , the conditions for fragmentation are more restrictive than previously reported , such that previously employed initial conditions ( e.g. @xmath23 ) are unable to fragment when fully resolved .",
    "vertically resolved disks closer to the critical value of stability criterion are required ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "convergence studies also indicate that artificial fragmentation is likely with resolution significantly less than that employed for our production runs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* in preparation ) .",
    "the primary new results , reported here , are the diskiness of the young bd , the extension of the mass distribution down to planetary masses and the likelihood of multiple or even hierachical systems .",
    "a typical prograde encounter is depicted in fig  [ fg : encounter ] . because of the tidal interaction , gas in the outer part ( @xmath25 au ) disperses .",
    "fragmentation usually occurred after the disks passed periastron . in the case",
    "depicted here , a 20 @xmath26 clump formed in a distant tidal arm structure at t = 14,000 years and two objects ( with mass 9 and 70 @xmath27 ) formed via gravitational instability in an inner disk at t = 15,000 years .",
    "three basic mechanisms were found for forming sub - stellar mass objects : fragmentation within shock layers , condensations within prograde tidal structures and fragmentation via instabilities in the inner disks after inflows .",
    "shocks ( fig .",
    "[ fg : encounter ] , label a ) formed due to the highly supersonic velocities of the impacts , but fragmentation in shocks only happened in coplanar encounters .",
    "tidal tails ( fig .",
    "[ fg : encounter ] , label b ) were induced by gravitational resonance in prograde disks .",
    "disk instability ( fig .",
    "[ fg : encounter ] ,",
    "label c ) was a common feature during encounters , as mass moved inwards due to angular momentum transport via tidal tails for prograde disks or cancellation of rotation in retrograde cases .",
    "the self - gravitating objects produced in the simulations are in the mass range from 2 ( 600 particles ) to 73 jupiter masses , covering the bd and giant planet regimes .",
    "all of the objects are highly flattened and disk - like ( fig .",
    "[ fg : fragspin ] ) .",
    "a t - tauri - like phase , implying a disk , has been observed for planetary mass object @xcite . at the end of the simulations ,",
    "the proto - bd disks had radii 0.3 - 18 au , with the lower limit quite likely related to the gravitational softening ( 0.2 au ) and height - to - radius ratios of @xmath28 .",
    "the objects spin rapidly and most of the clumps formed via fragmentation of protostellar disks have similar spin directions to the parent disk .",
    "but it is not necessary true for the clumps formed in shock layers or tidal tails .",
    "the simulations were halted several thousand years after bd - mass objects form when the stars are well past peri - astron . during further evolution , gas in the bd disks with lower specific angular momentum should condense to form a central core , and the remaining disk will accrete onto the core on a viscous time scale . in order to for these fast - rotating disks",
    "lose their angular momentum , it is natural to expect observable bipolar outflows . these were confirmed observationally via the recent detection of several forbidden lines ( _ e.g. _ @xmath29 \\ & [ s_{ii}]$ ] ) and a p cygni - like dip in the @xmath0 profile in the spectrum of a young bd @xmath30 oph 102 @xcite .",
    "the lower accretion rate expected in a bd disk @xcite makes it a scaled - down version of a t tauri star as shown by the observed offset from the continuum of the forbidden emission lines in a bd - outflow @xcite .",
    "another way to distribute the angular momentum of the proto - bd disk is to form planets or further fragment . thus bd companions can have planetary masses , forming a bd - planet system , or comparable masses to the primary bd to form a binary or multiple bd system .",
    "the giant planet companion ( 2m1207 b ) to a nearby young bd found by the new vlt / naco imaging observations @xcite is a possible example of the former case .",
    "the large inferred inner holes in the spectra of some bd disks have been considered as signs of ongoing planet formation @xcite .",
    "formation of binary bd pair occurred in one of our simulations via the secondary fragmentation of a large ( 6 au ) clump @xmath31 au from the star .",
    "though with 5000 particles the clump is larger than the the entire protostellar disk in previous work , the jeans mass is only marginally resolved and this result should be confirmed with more resolution and additional physics .",
    "we note that fragmentation is not unexpected from a physical perspective given the high rate of spin @xcite .",
    "the two components ( 19 and 13 jupiter masses ) orbited each other with separation @xmath32 3 au and orbital period @xmath32 30 years .",
    "both retained a highly - flattened shape .",
    "it is likely that the system will remain as an hierarchical star - bd multiple .",
    "this case is observationally inferred for gl 569 where the primary is a m2.5v star ( gl 569a ) and a recently observationally - confirmed bd triple ( gl 569b ) @xcite .",
    "the age of the quadruple is about 100 - 125 myr so no disks are observed .",
    "however , in some of much younger bd multiples , accretion signatures are indicated via a v - band excess @xcite , suggesting accretion disks around the components .",
    "the rapid growth assumption of the competitive accretion scenario @xcite makes ejection a requirement in order to retain bds . in our simulations ,",
    "about one third of the clumps ( 12 out of 32 ) were unbound and left the parent disks with 1d rms velocity dispersion @xmath33 , higher than the velocities of the protostars . among the bound bds , three out twenty have large semi - major axes ( @xmath34 au ) .",
    "as gas dispersion is severe in the outer disk region due to the interaction , these objects will lose access to a gas reservoir and become free - floating bds or wide - separation bd companions as seen in observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for objects close to the star ( @xmath35 au )",
    ", ejection may occur due to interactions with other orbiters .",
    "the need to invoke ejection to shut off rapid growth is still under debate .",
    "for example , @xcite suggest that accretion is very slow and the final mass of an object is determined by the initial collapse and thus bd - mass objects should remain as brown dwarfs .",
    "the competitive accretion model also needs to better establish that the first objects to form in a cluster environment will have such low masses .",
    "encounter - induced protostellar disk fragmentation provides an additional mechanism to produce brown dwarfs and it does not rule out bd formation via other methods such as turbulent fragmentation .",
    "ongoing work involving more encounter cases will build up statistics to enable estimates of which of these models is more likely to produce observed sub - stellar populations based on the production rates , bd disk properties , the frequency of multiples and the impact on proto - stellar evolution and accretion histories .    a preliminary mass distribution of the simulated young bds is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fg : massdist ] .",
    "the clumps were found to be more abundant at the lower mass end , which is broadly consistent with observed substellar initial mass function @xcite .",
    "the turnover at the lowest ( planetary ) mass ( @xmath36 ) is related to our resolution limits .",
    "an apparent gap in the population from 35 - 60 @xmath27 is suggested in the figure , but the current statistics are insufficient to confirm it and additional runs will be required . clumps typically form more than 100 au from a star but sometimes significantly closer where the physical conditions are more complex .",
    "however , there is no apparent bias ( according to radius of formation ) in the mass distribution and it looks similar if clumps within 100 au are excluded .",
    "if encounter - induced bd formation is dominant , the bd numbers ( relative to the number of stars ) is expected to differ depending on the star - forming environment .",
    "observation indications of this have been reported ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but the data are not conclusive .",
    "the way this ratio varies as a function of cluster properties is not straightforward .",
    "for example , an increase in the cluster density indicates more impacts between its members , while a higher velocity dispersion in denser cluster greatly reduces the number of fragments per encounter ( * ? ? ? * in preparation ) . to make a concrete prediction regarding bd production as a function of star cluster properties ,",
    "the more comprehensive set of simulations now underway will have to be combined with detailed estimates of encounter rates in young star clusters ."
