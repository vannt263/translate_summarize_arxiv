    "in the simplest models of inflation , the inflaton smoothly rolls down its potential while continuously producing super - hubble perturbations via amplification of quantum fluctuations .",
    "when trying to embed the inflaton into a more concrete framework based on high energy physics models , one finds that this uneventful story could be altered in several ways .",
    "it is important to identify these alternative possibilities and to relate them to specific observational signatures , that could be looked for in future cosmological data .",
    "an example of such alterations is the possibility that the coupling of the inflaton to other fields might affect its evolution .",
    "this is in particular the case if some field coupled to the inflaton becomes suddenly light at some special point along the inflationary trajectory .",
    "indeed , whenever the effective mass of a field becomes small , there may be an associated burst of particle production , as thoroughly studied in preheating  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) where this occurs while the inflaton is oscillating at the bottom of its potential .",
    "the same phenomenon can also take place during inflation , as pointed out in @xcite , and such an event can temporarily trap or at least slow - down the inflaton by draining its kinetic energy .",
    "if such a trapping event occurs while observable modes are exiting the horizon during inflation this may lead to features in the power - spectrum @xcite , as well as localised non - gaussian spikes in the cmb , ( see @xcite for a recent comprehensive paper on this topic ) .",
    "by contrast , if this event occurs well after all the observable modes have exited the hubble radius there might not be any observable signature ( except perhaps primordial black hole formation on very small scales ) if the trapping effect is exactly the same in all parts of our accessible universe .",
    "however , if the strength of the trapping fluctuates , this acts as an additional source of primordial adiabatic perturbations because the duration of inflation varies from place to place @xcite .",
    "this modulation of the trapping can be the consequence of an explicit dependence of the coupling on another light scalar field as considered in @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we primarily focus on the situation where the modulation is due to the fluctuations of the initial conditions of a multi - dimensional inflaton . indeed ,",
    "if one assumes that particle production occurs near a specific point in the multi - dimensional inflaton field space , then the trapping effect is stronger if the inflationary trajectory comes closer to this point during the grazing encounter .",
    "a slight change in the initial position of the inflaton thus affects the whole duration of inflation , depending on how much particle production slows down the inflatons and/or alters its initial trajectory .    the location in field space where additional degrees of freedom become light are often associated with enhanced symmetries , which some authors consider beautiful @xcite .",
    "these extra species / symmetry locations ( esl , esp if it is a point ) are a common occurrence in moduli spaces originating in string theory , see @xcite for a small selection of examples , and moduli fields can get trapped near such loci @xcite ( the string higgs effect @xcite ) .",
    "if these fields drive inflation and if several esps / esls are encountered , trapped inflation can result @xcite ( see also @xcite for related work ) ; however , in this paper , we focus on a single grazing esp encounter .",
    "since inflationary trajectories are slowed down and derail from their prior course as the esp is passed , one might say that beauty is distractive in our case .",
    "a modulated trapping event can easily produce significant non - gaussianity of the local type , as stressed in @xcite .",
    "the current observational bound on the local type of the bispectrum from seven years of wmap data is @xmath0 at the @xmath1 level @xcite .",
    "the bounds on the trispectrum , which are roughly @xmath2 and @xmath3 , come from large scale structure @xcite , and the cmb @xcite .",
    "if there is no detection , constraints with planck should be tightened by an order of magnitude .",
    "future cmb constraints on the trispectrum parameters were considered in @xcite .",
    "we find that a single close esp encounter during inflation , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : grazingesp ] , can yield the dominant contribution to the power - spectrum , see sec .",
    "[ sec : tunedesp ] , if the coupling is of order one ( we also discuss mixed scenarios , where @xmath4 is neither close to zero nor one ) ; this new contribution is accompanied by observably large non - gaussianities . if the encounter occurs during the time - frame when large - scale modes are leaving the horizon , an additional bump - like feature in the power - spectrum results ruling out the model for @xmath5 @xcite ; however , a subsequent encounter can successfully modulate large - scale fluctuations ; the still present bump on smaller scales can , if observed in future experiments , be used to identify the time of the encounter and offer a consistency check .",
    "if non - gaussianities are not observed , we can rule out the majority of esp encounters , that is , we can severely constrain the interactions of the inflatons during inflation .    in models considered in this paper ,",

    "[ sec : numerics ] .",
    "we find that the analytic expressions are excellent for intermediate impact parameters @xmath6 , which are needed anyhow if the additional contribution to the power - spectrum satisfies the cobe bound . for smaller impact parameters temporary trapping events can take place if the coupling is strong enough ; however , since trajectories become chaotic and thus extremely sensitive to initial conditions , we can rule out such encounters .",
    "a summary of the different regimes that we discuss is provided in table  [ tab : regimes ] .",
    "we relate the likelihood of a single esp encounter to the average inter esp separation in ( and the dimensionality of ) field space in sec .",
    "[ sec : trappedinflation ] , where we also comment on the relationship to trapped inflation .",
    "modest esp densities with an average inter - esp distance of @xmath7 are sufficient in a two dimensional field space to render a grazing esp encounter a likely occurrence during the last sixty efoldings of inflation .",

    "this is evident if the modulaton is promoted to a second inflaton , sec.[sec : grazespandmodulatedtrapping ] . in all cases we find comparable non - gaussianities , and we provide consistency relations between the various observables @xmath8 throughout this article .",
    "some technical aspects related to the validity of the approximations used to describe particle production ( non - adiabaticity , sudden event ) at an esp are provided in the appendix .",
    "we are interested in the effect that an esp ( extra species / symmetry point @xcite ) encounter has on the trajectory , and subsequently on observables , in a @xmath9d field space during inflation .",

    "when the inflationary trajectory comes close to the esp , the @xmath14 particles become light @xmath17 ( in the following we ignore the presence of a small bare mass for the @xmath14 particles ) . thus ,",
    "if the impact parameter @xmath18 is small enough ( see figures [ pic : trajectory1 ] and [ pic : trajectory2 ] ) , particle production can occur , similar to preheating @xcite , see @xcite for reviews and @xcite for multi - field preheating . for small impact parameters",

    "this is a complicated problem in general , but , in our case , it is reasonable to use the hartree approximation , so that the equation of motion of the inflaton becomes ( see appendix ( [ app:2 ] ) for details ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the energy density of the @xmath14 field .",

    "be it a change in velocity or an actual deviation of the trajectory , leads to a change in the number of efoldings , @xmath36 .",

    "these conditions are consistent with those given in eq .",
    "( 43 ) of @xcite , but here we have also checked whether or not one can neglect the exponential suppression term .",
    "we see that there exists a consistent regime , but within a fine tuned range of initial values for @xmath330 .",
    "the effect of the exponential suppression and fine tuning of the initial conditions is potentially reduced if we consider an extra species locus ( esl ) instead of an esp .",
    "two simple choices come to mind : a straight line esl along @xmath358 , so that every trajectory passes through the esp during inflation , or a compact esl i.e.  a circular one centred at the origin .",
    "both choices are feasibly in moduli spaces . since they simply indicate that the esl is independent of a field ( the first choice ) or an angular direction .",
    "we choose to focus on the second case only , without any theoretical bias either way . to make the two - dimensional field space explicit , we replace @xmath330 by @xmath359 from here on .",
    "thus , we wish to investigate an interaction lagrangian of the form [ modesl ] l=-12 g^2 ( ||- ||)^2 ^2 , with a modulated coupling , @xmath360 . then all trajectories become nearly straight lines and the exponential suppression term can be neglected for any trajectory .",
    "however , a simple calculation shows that approximately the same fine - tuning on the initial condition for @xmath359 is needed in order to have the correct amplitude of the power - spectrum if these perturbations dominate over the usual slow  roll contribution , i.e.  @xmath361 is still required .",
    "if we had considered a constant coupling @xmath99 , then all trajectories would be equally delayed by the esl encounter and there would be no effect on the perturbation spectrum ( in the case of a rotationally symmetric potential , which we are considering here ) .",
    "however , in general even an esl with a constant coupling will generate perturbations provided that it breaks some symmetry between trajectories with an isocurvature perturbation between them . for example , an elliptical esl centred at the origin , or a circular esl not centred at the origin , will both generate a contribution to the curvature perturbation at the time of particle production",
    ". such a model would be similar to an inhomogeneous end of inflation @xcite , which typically requires a very strongly elliptical surface on which inflation ends as well as a fine tuning of initial conditions @xcite .",
    "why do we require this tuning , even when we are justified in neglecting the exponential suppression in ( [ mdc : n ] ) ?",
    "a discussion of this point is given in the conclusion of @xcite . in order for the perturbations associated with the trapping ( @xmath359 direction ) to dominate over those generated by the inflaton in the usual way ( @xmath90 direction ) , we require that [ isoc - inequality ] ( ) ^2 ( ) ^2~ 10 ^ 2 .",
    "the size of the isocurvature perturbations in each model is given by @xmath362 , independently of the background trajectory .",
    "thus , these small perturbations correspond to a significant perturbation in the value of @xmath359 only if the background trajectory lies close to @xmath363 , i.e.  @xmath364 is non - negligible only for small @xmath359 .",
    "this requirement is needed to satisfy the inequality ( [ isoc - inequality ] ) for all of the models that we have considered so far . however , if @xmath359 is too small , i.e. @xmath365 , then non - gaussianities become large and the model is ruled out by observations . the axis",
    "are chosen such that the esp lies on the @xmath90-axis .",
    "the requirement that the value @xmath359 is small is then identical to the requirement that the impact parameter @xmath26 to the esp is small in sec .",
    "[ sec : tunedesp ] .",
    "further , @xmath366 was written as @xmath367 which we imposed throughout sec .",
    "[ sec : grazingesp ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : tunedesp ] . ]",
    "the possibility that the effective mass of a field coupled to the inflaton becomes small , leading to particle production , has been well studied in the case that this occurs either while modes of the scale observed today cross the horizon ( a window of 510 efoldings ) or shortly after inflation ends , i.e.  preheating .",
    "however , there is a long period in between these two times ( circa 50 efoldings ) during which particle production may occur , and this case has been much less studied .",
    "although we can not directly observe any bump / feature this may cause on the power - spectrum on these scales , simply because we are unable to observationally probe these scales , we may see an effect on the usual cmb scales .    in the simplest case , with only one inflaton field",
    ", there is no affect onto observables caused by such particle production , but if the strength or position of the esp depends on a second field , then this conclusion does not hold , as was studied by langlois and sorbo @xcite . here",
    "we focussed instead on multiple ",
    "field inflation . for most initial conditions",
    ", the trajectory in field space will not go through the esp , but graze it , still leading to particle production and backreaction in the vicinity of the esp .",
    "the dominant effect is usually the temporary slow down of the inflaton , as part of its kinetic energy is diverted to generating particles , which slow down the fields further via their backreaction ; in addition the trajectory bends towards the esp due to the attraction of the generated particles , whose mass grow as the inflaton moves further away .",
    "the expansion of the universe and associated dilution of these particles ensures that the effect only lasts a few efoldings before a slow  roll attractor trajectory is again reached .    in multi - field scenarios",
    "the minimum distance between trajectories and the esp varies due to the presence of isocurvature perturbations ( those perpendicular to the velocity along the inflaton trajectory ) .",
    "the closer to the esp that a trajectory comes , the greater the particle production and the larger the consequent slow - down of the trajectory , hence the isocurvature perturbation is partially converted to the adiabatic perturbation on all scales which have already crossed the horizon . in order for this encounter to significantly affect the trajectory",
    ", it must pass close enough to be reasonably strongly distracted by the  beauty \" of the esp . for the models we have studied , an impact parameter of order @xmath368 is required , which would represent a fine tuning of the initial conditions if only one esp exists , but for an average esp spacing of order @xmath369 at least one such encounter becomes likely .",
    "an order of unity coupling constant between the inflaton and the produced particles is the most interesting case , so no tuning of this parameter is required .",
    "the case of a very dense set of esp s , leading to multiple trapping events per efolding , was previously studied by d.  and t.  battefeld in @xcite .",
    "what are the most interesting consequences of such a grazing esp encounter ?",
    "since this effect is asymmetric , most strongly affecting trajectories which pass closest to the esp and most weakly those furthest away , this will generate a skewness in the probability distribution of trajectories , which is parametrised by @xmath67 ( the amplitude of the bispectrum ) .",
    "the trispectrum is also affected , and the ratio @xmath370 provides a measure on which proportion of the observed linear perturbation where generated by the esp encounter , with the inequality being saturated in the case that the encounter gives the dominant effect and the usual slow  roll perturbations are negligible . since we have studied a quadratic potential with equal masses the scale dependence of the power spectrum and non - linearity parameters",
    "are suppressed , but for a more complex potential they would typically be a larger .",
    "we have also considered the possibility of a one dimensional enhanced symmetry locus , which is a natural generalisation of the modulated trapping model to multiple fields . in this case",
    "every trajectory may pass through a point where the coupled field becomes massless , removing the need to fine - tune initial conditions , but one needs a strong difference in the strength of the particle production event between trajectories in order generate an observably large signature .",
    "in all cases we find observably large non - gaussianities on cmb scales given that the power - spectrum is dominated by the effects brought forth via particle production during the intermediate 50-efoldings of inflation .",
    "thus , if planck does not observe primordial non - gaussianities , the interaction of inflatons throughout inflation are constrained .",
    "if inflatons are identified with moduli fields in string theory , we can thus probe not only the potential along the inflationary trajectory , but also the presence of enhanced symmetries in moduli space in the vicinity of the path the fields take .",

    "one may further check that the time - scale of particle production is considerably less than the hubble time , so that the expansion of the universe and the inflationary potential can be neglected during this interval .",

    "this question is addressed in @xcite for a two - dimensional scalar field space , without including a potential , and ignoring the cosmological evolution .    in the present work ,",
    "we follow the approximation proposed in @xcite , which consists of decomposing the impact of particle production into two successive phases . in the first phase , which is very short ,",
    "adiabaticity is strongly violated and one can compute , using the methods of preheating , the number of particles produced , assuming that the trajectory remains unperturbed . in the second phase , by contrast , the number of particles is assumed to be conserved ( i.e.  simply diluted by the volume expansion in our cosmological case ) and the backreaction on the trajectory is taken into account by considering the interaction between the scalar field and the produced particles , or more specifically the energy density of the particles , given by v_int=_()=g|-_p|n , where @xmath379 is the number density of particles and @xmath380 their effective mass .        if one decomposes this equation along the directions parallel and orthogonal to the initial ( unperturbed ) trajectory , one finds @xmath381 where we have used the fact that the gradient of the potential vanishes in the orthogonal direction and @xmath382 .",

    "when the above approximation is not valid , in particular when particle production can not be considered as instantaneous , one must in general solve numerically the system involving the evolution of the mode functions of the @xmath14 field combined with the equation of motion for the scalar field , as done in @xcite in the case of a scalar field with @xmath384 in minkowski spacetime is small seems to be analytically tractable . ] .",
