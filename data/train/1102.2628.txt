    "the collective nonlinear excitations are of fundamental properties of ionized environments , which occur in periodic and solitary forms .",
    "the first experimental evidence of the ion - acoustic solitary excitations was realized by h. ikezi , et.al , in 1970 @xcite .",
    "also , sagdeev pseudo - potential method @xcite , is one of the oldest @xcite and remarkably simple but effective approaches for investigation of the nonlinear propagations in plasmas , which is analogous to the classical problem of a particle trapped in a potential . during the past few decades",
    ", there has been many investigations on the nonlinear wave propagations in diverse magnetized and unmagnetized plasma kinds @xcite , using sagdeev approach .",
    "however , even in a simple two - fluid plasma interesting wave phenomenon occur due to a large mass difference between electrons and ions .",
    "recently , it has been shown @xcite that in a simple electron - ion quantum plasma the criterion for the existence of solitary excitations is fundamentally governed by the system dimensionality and the ion degrees of freedom * ( dof)*. on the other hand , it has been remarked @xcite that the ion - temperature can have crucial importance on nonlinear wave dynamics in degenerate electron - positron - ion plasmas .",
    "historically , the nonlinear ion - acoustic wave theory has been developed to include a finite ion - temperature effects @xcite because of quantitative discrepancies between theory and experiment .",
    "one of the greatest challenges of plasma research is to understand the nonlinear processes in astrophysical environments .",
    "for instance , the origin of high - energy superthermal ( non - maxwellian ) charged particles , observed in solar wind , magnetosphere , interstellar medium and auroral zone @xcite , is one of the unsolved problems in the field of space and astrophysical plasmas .",
    "many dense astrophysical objects such as white dwarfs , usually accompanied by strong magnetic fields , are considered as completely degenerate alike ordinary metals @xcite , in which the inter - electron distances are much lower than the characteristic de broglie thermal wavelength , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the electron degeneracy state , such as that encountered in normal metals is caused by pauli exclusion rule @xcite .",
    "the state of plasma degeneracy has been recently studied using the remarkably simple and effective thomas - fermi approximation , where , it has been shown @xcite that electron degeneracy may lead to distinct features in nonlinear solitary interactions and propagations . for ultradense plasmas with electron densities as high as @xmath3 ( such as in white dwarfs ) , where the exchange effects may be dominant , the thomas - fermi approximation has to be extended to thomas - fermi - dirac approximation @xcite .",
    "investigations confirm @xcite that , the relativistically degenerate fermi - dirac dusty plasma , unlike the simple thomas - fermi counterpart , accommodates a wide variety of nonlinear excitations . in some massive white dwarfs , the catastrophic gravitational pressure may lead to the extreme relativistic degeneracy state , consequently , giving rise to the total collapse of the star @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamical features of a superdense degenerate electron gas has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite in both nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic limits , employing the fermi - dirac quantum statistics .    for fusion - like astrophysical compact object such as a white - dwarf the partial or finite - temperature degeneracy assumption may be more relevant compared to the zero - temperature degeneracy model .",
    "unfortunately , the effect of finite - temperature electron degeneracy has not been paid sufficient attention in the study of nonlinear wave dynamics in superdense plasmas , whereas , it is the most relevant situation for astrophysical cases . in this work",
    "we examine the most general criterion for the existence of the solitary ion excitations in magnetized plasmas .",

    "<S> based on the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) model , an exact arbitrary - amplitude general solution is presented for oblique propagation of solitary excitations in two- and three - component quasineutral magnetoplasmas , adopting the standard pseudopotential approach . </S>",
    "<S> it is revealed that the necessary matching criterion of existence of such oblique nonlinear propagations in two and three - fluid magnetoplasmas share global features . </S>",
    "<S> these features are examined for the cases of electron - ion and electron - positron - ion magnetoplasmas with diverse equations of state . </S>",
    "<S> this study also reveals that for electron - ion magnetoplasmas with plasma - frequencies larger than the cyclotron - frequency ( @xmath0 ) a critical - angle of @xmath1}$ ] exists , at which propagation of solitary excitation is not possible . </S>",
    "<S> coriolis effect on allowed soliton matching condition in rotating magnetoplasmas is also considered as an extension to this work . </S>",
    "<S> current investigation can have important implications for nonlinear wave dynamics in astrophysical as well as laboratory magnetoplasmas . </S>"
