    "in a series of papers the idea that time - reparametrization invariance ( tri ) should be the reason for large non - equilibrium fluctuations in glassy systems was introduced .",
    "this claim was substantiated with the analysis of the martin - siggia - rose - janssen - dedominicis ( msrjd ) action for langevin stochastic processes  @xcite and by numerical simulations of various glassy models  @xcite .",
    "the state of the art of these ideas is summarized in  @xcite .",
    "the non - equilibrium situation we are concerned with is a dynamic process where a system is quenched below a transition or dynamic crossover with some protocol and it is let relax subsequently .",
    "the most interesting time regime after the quench is the one in which the size of the sample is the largest ( though still finite ) scale and times are long but not as much as to allow for equilibration .",
    "the system is then in an asymptotic non - equilibrium regime in which a kind of dynamic scaling is very often realized . in this stage",
    "the behavior of time - dependent observables is rather well understood  @xcite .",
    "the sources of fluctuations in the dynamics of these systems are disorder in the initial conditions , thermal noise , quenched disorder and external forces , if present . in  @xcite and references",
    "therein the proposal was to average over any sort of quenched randomness with the purpose of bringing together disordered systems  such as spin - glasses , superconductors , or other  and conventional glasses  of atomic , molecular or other nature .",
    "external forces were set to zero and had no effect on the dynamics .",
    "one is then left with initial condition and thermally induced fluctuations only . in order to study their effects , beside the fully averaged value @xmath2 of physical quantities , one has to consider the properties of their fluctuating parts @xmath3 , to be defined properly , which may be sample dependent .",
    "the most complete characterization of fluctuations is then obtained through the probability distribution @xmath4 . in particular , since the relevance of fully - averaged two - time quantities such as the self - correlation @xmath5 function , the linear autoresponse @xmath6 and their fluctuating parts , to the issue of tri was underlined in  @xcite , one is interested in the probability distributions of @xmath7 and @xmath8 studied as a function of @xmath7 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , the system size and the other parameters in the model .",
    "this is , however , a formidable task .",
    "less ambitious but still very instructive is to analyze the first moments of the distributions , such as the generalized variances that we shall define in the body of this paper .",

    "response functions are associated to the auxiliary field @xmath80 and hence their fluctuating parts can not be expressed in terms of the physical field @xmath15 alone .",

    "the values of the restriction @xmath7 is an additional parameter that tunes the crossover from the quasi - equilibrium behavior to the fully aging regime . in particular , the latter is obtained letting @xmath7 be small ( with respect to the ea order parameter ) . in this case , the restricted average scales as the fully averaged one , but its actual value is not the main contribution to the latter .",
    "these results have to be compared to the ones found in the ising model . in this clean coarsening case",
    "the exponents @xmath267 do depend on the fluctuating observables and the restricted average @xmath254 is of the same order as the full average @xmath112 , showing that fluctuations of @xmath7 are not the main source for those of @xmath8 , at variance to what it is found in the disordered model .",
    "these qualitative and quantitative differences between these two systems add to differences found in the relation between the averaged linear response and the self - correlation , i.e. the effective temperature  @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that the fluctuating out of equilibrium dynamics of the @xmath0 ea model and of coarsening systems are different and that this can be related to the fact that tri is realized in the former model while it is not in the latter .",
    "this should also be linked to the fact that the effective temperature is finite in the former and infinite in the latter cases .",

    "<S> this article is a contribution to the understanding of fluctuations in the out of equilibrium dynamics of glassy systems . by extending theoretical ideas based on the assumption that time - reparametrization invariance develops asymptotically </S>",
    "<S> we deduce the scaling properties of diverse high - order correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> we examine these predictions with numerical tests in a standard glassy model , the @xmath0 edwards - anderson spin - glass , and in a system where time - reparametrization invariance is not expected to hold , the @xmath1 ferromagnetic ising model , both at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> our results enlighten a qualitative difference between the fluctuation properties of the two models and show that scaling properties conform to the time - reparametrization invariance scenario in the former but not in the latter .    </S>",
