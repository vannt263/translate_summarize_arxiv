    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) harbors the nearest giant extragalactic hii region @xcite , the tarantula nebula ( 30 doradus ) .",
    "the central region of the nebula is dominated by the cluster ngc  2070 , a collective of several dense sub - clusters ( @xcite ) whose light is dominated by massive ob stars .",
    "the most prominent of these sub - clusters is the very central super star cluster ( ssc ) r  136 .",
    "this region has a number of characteristics that make it extraordinary .",
    "first of all , it displays an extreme rate of star formation ( sf ) , with one quarter of the total massive recent ( @xmath4 myr ) star formation in the lmc contained within 15@xmath5 from 30 doradus @xcite .",
    "moreover , with a stellar mass of at least @xmath6 concentrated within a radius of 4.7 pc @xcite , this cluster can be classified as a relatively low - mass clone of more distant starburst clusters , likely building blocks of starburst galaxies .    over the years",
    ", there have been debates over whether or not ngc  2070 is a young analog of old globular clusters .",
    "recent arguments seem to suggest a positive answer .",
    "using photometry @xcite found that ngc2070 s initial mass function ( imf ) is salpeter - like down to @xmath7 , giving the first direct evidence that solar - like stars are formed in a starburst cluster . using multi - epoch spectroscopy of o - type stars , @xcite measured a velocity dispersion between 4 and 5 kms@xmath8 , close to the expected value if it were in virial equilibrium . in this case",
    "the velocity dispersion would be low enough to allow the cluster to stay bound .",
    "due to the proximity of the lmc , 30 doradus can be imaged with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) on scales down to @xmath9 pc , resolving stars down to the sub - solar regime . by coupling hst imaging with ground - based spectroscopy diagnostics , we know that the region has undergone continuous sf activity or a superposition of multiple bursts of sf . indeed , over the whole region",
    ", there is evidence of at least three events : i ) an on - going off - center activity , as documented by the presence of embedded o - type stars and luminous infrared protostars along an arc of molecular gas and warm dust around 30 doradus @xcite ; ii ) a recent event , represented by the ssc r  136 itself , 2 myr old or less , as inferred from spectroscopy of the o stars ( @xcite ) , 3 - 4 myr old from hst imaging ( @xcite ) ; iii ) an `` old '' event , documented by the presence of hodge 301 , a 25 myr old cluster ( @xcite ) located only 3 arcmin northwest of r  136 .",
    "however , most of high resolution studies are limited to a few bands and cover only small patches of the 30 doradus complex . the hubble tarantula treasury project ( http ; sabbi et al .",
    "2015 , in prep . ) , an hst survey covering a @xmath10 wide area around 30 doradus at high resolution , fills this gap .",
    "this unique data - set , which combines resolution and spatial coverage , can be exploited in varied ways , including studies of massive sf , low mass sf , the imf , the reddening distribution , etc .. in our current paper , we take the opportunity to explore the sf during the last 50 myr for the central 40 pc of 30 doradus , a.k.a .",
    "the starburst cluster ngc  2070 , by comparing the observational color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) with state - of - the - art synthetic cmds .",
    "these simulations incorporate the latest ( v.1.2s ) set of padova and trieste stellar evolution code ( parsec ) isochrones ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , the first theoretical library to include homogeneously all stellar phases from pre - main sequence ( pms ) to post - main sequence for all masses between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "for the first time , we derive the history of the region using low and intermediate mass stars , either in the pms or main sequence ( ms ) phases , _",
    "simultaneously_. in particular , we exploit magnitudes and colors of the pms turn ons ( hereafter ton ; see section [ tons ] ) , i.e. the cmd loci where the pms phase joins to the ms .",
    "this `` hook '' has been demonstrated to be particularly sensitive to age ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we use both the optical f555w vs f555w@xmath3f775w and the near infrared ( nir ) f110w vs f110w@xmath3f160w cmds of the http sample , which offer complementary advantages in terms of higher spatial resolution ( the optical ) and lower reddening sensitivity ( the nir ) .    to recover the sf rate of ngc  2070 since the beginning of its activity",
    ", there are three important factors that must be accounted for : differential reddening , lmc field contamination , and stellar crowding .",
    "the first causes the cmd features to appear redder and more scattered , mimicking older populations and lowering the age resolution .",
    "field contamination mostly adds low mass stars to the sample , mimicking much older populations and a steeper imf .",
    "finally , stellar confusion affects completeness and , therefore , the reachable look - back time .",
    "moreover , unaccounted incompleteness can also mimic mass segregation .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly describe the observations .",
    "section 3 is dedicated to the physics of the ton clock . in section 4",
    "we identify the general properties of the stellar populations in the http data - set , with special emphasis on ngc  2070 . in section 5",
    "we perform artificial star tests , the only way to take crowding into account , and we recover the sfh of ngc  2070 using the synthetic cmd approach .",
    "field contamination is also carefully discussed .",
    "results are presented in section 6 and compared to the literature in section 7 .",
    "section 8 compares ngc  2070 with other starburst clusters .",
    "our conclusions ( section 9 ) close the paper .    throughout the paper , for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will refer to the entire http data - set as `` 30 doradus '' , the starburst cluster as ngc  2070 and its core as r  136 .",
    "we observed 30 doradus with the hst wide - field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) and the hst advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) as part of proposal go-12939 ( pi : e. sabbi ) .",
    "we built this program on an existing hst monochromatic survey in the f775w filter ( go-12499 , pi : lennon ) , designed to measure proper motions of runaway candidates . in both data - sets we used the wide field channel ( wfc ) of acs in parallel with either the uvis or the ir channels of wfc3 to maximize the efficiency of the observations .",
    "the images were taken with the filters f275w , f336w , f555w , f658n , f110w and f160w between december 2012 and september 2013 .",
    "the survey utilized 60 orbits .",
    "figure [ 30d_full ] shows the f775w image of 30 doradus with indicated the major stellar concentrations , ngc  2070 , hodge  301 and ngc  2060 .",
    "bright and faint sources are respectively identified using the packages img2xym_wfc.09x10 ( @xcite ) and ks2 , an evolution of the program described in @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the photometric analysis can be found in sabbi et al .",
    "( 2015 , in preparation ) .",
    "we culled the catalog of detected objects to only include sources with high quality in the psf - fitting , q@xmath13 .",
    "the final catalog contains @xmath14 detected in the filter f275w , @xmath15 in f336w , @xmath16 in f555w , @xmath17 in f658n , @xmath18 in f775w , @xmath19 stars in f110w and @xmath20 in the f160w .",
    "one of the characteristics of 30 doradus that makes it a particularly interesting object is the high concentration of massive stars that coexist with a plethora of coeval intermediate and low mass pms stars .",
    "this enables us to reconstruct the past history of 30 doradus using the ms turn - off ( msto ) , whose ms evolutionary times are shorter than @xmath21 myr . ] , the locus of the cmd where ms stars exhaust their core hydrogen , and the pms ton , where low and intermediate mass pms stars ignite hydrogen in their cores . in terms of stellar mass ,",
    "the msto mass is the mass of the most massive star still on the ms at an evolutionary time corresponding to the age of the cluster , while the ton mass is the mass of the least massive star that has reached the ms at the age of the cluster . in the following we discuss pros and cons of the two clocks .    _",
    "massive stars : _ the main appeal of using the msto of massive stars ( m@xmath22 ) stems from the high luminosity of such sources , which translates into high quality photometry and complete samples . the optical and infrared spectra of these objects are well approximated by the rayleigh - jeans tail of a black body with temperature t@xmath23 .",
    "hence , given that the spectral energy distribution shape is almost unchanged as a function of wavelength , the optical and infrared colors are nearly constant ( and around 0 mag ) .",
    "this is clearly visible in figure [ 3iso ] , where we overlaid young isochrones of different ages ( 0.5 , 1 , 3 , 7 , 15 myr ) on to the entire http catalog ( shaded grey area ) in the uv ( left panel ) , optical ( middle panel ) and nir ( right panel ) cmds .",
    "the adopted distance modulus ( m@xmath3m)@xmath24 and reddening e(b@xmath3v ) are 18.5 ( @xcite ) and 0.3 ( chosen by eye based on the fit of the optical cmd ) , respectively . in the nir",
    "cmd the upper ms ( ums ) looks like a vertical line and isochrones of different age have mstos almost indistinguishable from one another .",
    "this degeneracy is attenuated in the optical and almost lifted in the uv cmd .",
    "observationally , studies of massive stars has always been hampered by their rarity , due to the short timescales involved in their evolution and the steepness of the imf .",
    "on the theoretical side , models of massive stars are still affected by major uncertainties .",
    "in particular , physical mechanisms like mass loss , rotation and binary evolution are not well understood ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "_ intermediate and low mass stars : _ for ages younger than 20 - 30 myr , the pms ton is another valuable stellar chronometer which involves intermediate and low mass stars instead of massive stars have no pms phase at all . ] . in analogy with the msto , the ton properties are directly related to the age of the stellar population , but with evolutionary times much shorter than the corresponding ms times .",
    "in fact , the age of a cluster is equal to the time spent in pms phase by its most massive star still in pms phase . by definition ,",
    "this star is at the ton .",
    "hence , when the intrinsic luminosity of the ton is detected , it is straightforward to associate it with the age of the cluster . from the cmd point of view",
    ", the potential strength of the ton is apparent from the morphology of the isochrones in fig .",
    "[ 3iso ] . in the optical and nir cmds the isochrone portion just before the ms has a hook and then is significantly flatter than the ms .",
    "the ton is at the vertex of the hook , quite easy to recognize . for ages older than 20@xmath330 myr",
    "the pms phase is much closer to the ms and the ton visibility declines .",
    "theory also predicts that the pms phase ( recognizable as the portion of the isochrones at the right of the ms in fig .",
    "[ 3iso ] ) itself is a valuable age indicator : older pms isochrones are fainter and closer to the ms than younger ones . however , poorly understood phenomenons like residual mass accretion and magnetic fields ( whose interplay is responsible for the appearing of irregular photometric variability and uv to infrared excesses ) , and observational uncertainties like differential reddening from the circumstellar material can dislocate these stars ( especially in the first few myr ) from their theoretical positions in the cmd ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "an advantage of the ton with respect to the msto derives from the evolution at nearly constant luminosity of pms stars near the ms , corresponding to an almost horizontal track in the optical and nir cmds .",
    "this leads to a luminosity(ton ) - age relation . on the other hand ,",
    "the ms evolution of massive stars near the msto is rather vertical ( except in the uv cmd ) , hence age is not uniquely related to luminosity . among the drawbacks ,",
    "the intrinsic faintness of tons compared to the mstos makes tons prone to photometric errors and incompleteness , issues that are exacerbated in the uv cmd because older tons tend to be also redder . from the theoretical side ,",
    "the ton visibility is intimately connected with the pms evolutionary times which are still model dependent ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .    in this paper",
    "we aim to study the sfh of 30 doradus with the tons , hence we focus our analysis on the optical and nir cmds . as shown in the optical cmd ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ 3iso ] ) , the most massive star that is relevant to this study is around @xmath25 .    before closing this section , we emphasize another interesting feature that emerges from fig .",
    "[ 3iso ] . whereas the isochrones reddened with e(b@xmath3v)= 0.3 fit well the ums in the optical and nir cmds ( middle and right panel ) , the same isochrones are clearly too blue in the uv cmd ( left panel ) .",
    "the explanation for this effect resides in the different populations that these cmds trace : most of the uv stars are very young 30 doradus stars , with minimal contamination from field stars ( the rc is hardly visible at f275w@xmath26 ) , while the optical and nir stars can be both members and field stars . as a consequence ,",
    "the average reddening of the young population in 30 doradus must be _ higher _ than the adopted value e(b@xmath3v)= 0.3 , while the average reddening of the field can be as low as the foreground mw reddening ( e(b@xmath3v)= 0.07 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the next section is dedicated to a cursory cmd inspection of the stellar populations in the whole http data - set .",
    "the cmd is the most powerful tool to recover the history of a resolved stellar population , since different parts of the cmd are populated by different masses with different evolutionary times . in the following analysis we use the cmd to investigate which populations are present in the whole http catalog and the role of the ngc  2070 region .",
    "for this task we use the optical cmd , which offers better spatial resolution than the nir one .",
    "a more quantitative analysis will be the subject of section [ sfr ] .",
    "the f555w vs f555w@xmath3f775w cmd of the entire http data - set is shown in fig .",
    "[ cmd_tot ] , with overlaid isodensity contours ( left panel ) and stellar isochrones ( parsec ) of different ages ( right panel ) .",
    "the first remarkable feature of this cmd is an extended ums , populated by a plethora of intermediate and high mass stars .",
    "as the overlaid isochrones show , the width of the ums is hardly explained by a difference in age .",
    "moreover , given the average youth of these stars , plausibly much younger than @xmath27 myr , a metallicity spread is unlikely . as widely discussed in other works ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "differential reddening is the main cause of this effect , although stellar rotation may also have a role in widening the ums .    to the right of the ums ,",
    "the next striking feature is the very elongated red clump ( rc ; see also section [ rc_sec ] ) and a broad red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "these phases are populated by stars older than 1 gyr and belonging to the general field population of the lmc . as for the ums width ,",
    "most of the elongation and broadening is due to severe differential reddening affecting the region ( see @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the lower ms shows a huge color dispersion ( more than 1 mag ) at relatively bright magnitudes ( f555w@xmath26 ) . as usual",
    ", a possible explanation comes from the comparison with the isochrones .",
    "although differential reddening contributes to this effect , pushing part of the lower ms ( lms ) to the red , the existence of short - lived massive stars requires that a large fraction of these red stars are genuine pms stars ( coeval with the massive stars ) .",
    "more information on the nature of these populations can be inferred from their spatial distribution .",
    "in fact , the spatial distribution of stars in different evolutionary stages yields important information on the star formation processes across the region . assuming a velocity dispersion of 21 - 27 kms@xmath8 ( measured from rgb stars ; @xcite ) , stars older than 1 gyr are expected to be diffused over scale lengths of several kpc ,",
    "hence their distribution should be rather uniform over the http field of view ( fov ; @xmath28200 pc ) .",
    "on the other hand , stars like those in ngc  2070 , young and with very low velocity dispersion ( 4@xmath35 kms@xmath8 ; @xcite ) , are expected to be close to their birthplace .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ cmd_tot ] highlights cmd regions of selected ums ( cyan box ) , rc ( green box ) , low mass ms ( lms ) ( pink box ) and pms ( blue box ) stars .",
    "ums and pms stars are young objects a few tens of myr old , rc stars are intermediate age stars ( @xmath29 gyr ) , lms are ms stars older than few tens of myr .",
    "figure [ all_xy ] shows the corresponding spatial density ( stars per pc@xmath30 ) .",
    "populations grow more compact as one moves toward younger ages ( see also fig . 5 and 6 in @xcite ) .",
    "other interesting features are :    \\1 ) the ums stars ( bottom left panel in fig .",
    "[ all_xy ] ) appear very clustered .",
    "three major concentrations are visible : ngc  2070 , the most prominent , about 40 pc wide ( encircled in blue ) , hodge  301 ( encircled in green ) and ngc  2060 ( encircled in cyan ) .",
    "lighter over - densities are also visible throughout the fov . in other words , although most of the ongoing and recent ( i.e. , in the last 50 myr ) sf is concentrated in few dense loci , a minor recent activity is present in the entire area ;    \\2 ) as compared to the ums distribution , rc distribution ( bottom - right panel ) is , as expected , rather uniform .",
    "rc stars are a pure sample of field stars .",
    "their age , older than 700 myr , rules out that these objects are associated with 30 doradus , which is , at most , a few myr old .",
    "the small over - densities are probably contamination of intermediate mass pms stars or very reddened massive stars from the youngest regions . from a theoretical point of view , the intrinsic position of the rc in the cmd could be affected by factors like binaries , differences in age and metallicity , etc .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , these effects are insufficient to account for the observed rc elongation ( up to 1.5 mag in f555w@xmath3f775w ) , which is mostly due to differential reddening .",
    "the source of this reddening is the gas / dust located between the closest and farthest rc star along the line of sight .",
    "more specifically , background rc stars suffer the highest degree of absorption , which is caused by the combination of milky way ( mw ) and 30 doradus extinction , while foreground stars will suffer only from mw ( e(b@xmath3v)@xmath31 ) extinction ;    \\3 ) the distributions of lms ( top - left panel ) and pms ( top - right panel ) stars appear mutually exclusive : the top - left corner of the fov shows a paucity of pms stars , while lms stars are clearly overabundant there . the main cause for this effect",
    "is reddening .",
    "most of the lms stars belong to the lmc field .",
    "this is because 30 doradus is younger than few myr , hence its ms stars are necessarily brighter than our lms box of fig .",
    "[ cmd_tot ] ( right panel ) ( at ages @xmath32 myr the 30 doradus low - mass stars are mainly still in pms , as suggested by the isochrones in fig .",
    "[ cmd_tot ] ) .",
    "under these circumstances , the only way to remove lms stars from the lms box is the action of reddening ( see also the map of fig .",
    "[ rc_spread ] ) .",
    "doing so , these reddened ms stars are likely to fill the pms box , eventually producing the observed anti - correlation lms / pms stars ( a similar behavior is found by @xcite in ngc  346 ; see their fig .",
    "in addition to this , the tendency of young pms stars to be concentrated where the optical depth is higher exacerbates this effect .",
    "the only exceptions are the center of ngc  2070 , where the lms stars are missed because of the severe incompleteness , and hodge  301 , whose high concentration of lms is due to its higher age ( so hodge  301 s ton gets into the lms box ) .    finally , the blue circle in fig . [ all_xy ] is the region we have used to recover the sfh of ngc  2070 .",
    "it is immediately clear from the maps that the region harbors most of the ums stars of the entire 30 doradus complex , as well as a remarkable concentration of pms stars . on the other hand",
    "the region is quite deficient in lms stars , probably lost because of the extreme crowding conditions .      in this section",
    "we discuss the broad cmd features of the stellar population of ngc  2070 .",
    "our selection includes all stars within 2000 pixels ( @xmath33 20 pc ) from the cluster center .",
    "figure [ cmd_c ] shows the corresponding cmd for the f555w vs f555w@xmath3f775w filters with overlaid isodensity contours ( left panel ) and parsec isochrones of 1 , 7 and 15 myr ( right panel ) .",
    "the ms contours of ngc  2070 differs from those of 30 doradus as a whole ( fig .",
    "[ cmd_tot ] ) .",
    "the peak density is around f555w@xmath34 , with minor peaks down to f555w@xmath35 , while the 30 doradus cmd shows a smooth profile down to f555w@xmath36 .            in figure [ cmd_c_lf_radial ]",
    "we investigate the radial distribution of stars in ngc  2070 .",
    "the top panels show cmds of stars in concentric annuli ( 1 - 2 - 3 ) of equal area ( the radius of the innermost circle is about 12 pc ) around the center of the cluster ( from left to right , progressively further out from the center ) , the bottom panel shows the corresponding luminosity functions ( lfs ) . we find that :    \\1 ) the lf of the innermost region 1 shows two clear peaks , located at f555w@xmath34 and f555w@xmath36 .",
    "the bright peak is well fitted by an isochrone of 7 myr ( see the figure ) , evidence of a young ton .",
    "stars brighter than this magnitude are mostly ms cluster members , while fainter stars are members only if they are on the pms ( by the definition of ton , fainter members have not reached the ms yet ) .",
    "indeed , a visual inspection of the cmd shows a clear color bimodality below f555w@xmath34 , which is likely due to field ms stars ( mostly not - members ) on the blue side , and pms stars ( members ) on the red side .",
    "the dip after the bright peak is caused by the short evolutionary timescale of the pms phase compared to the ms .",
    "after the dip the lf rises again following the imf , which increases at lower masses . eventually the incompleteness wins , creating the second decline at f555w@xmath36 .",
    "the apparent lack of lower ms stars in the region 1 is probably due to the higher crowding , which causes more severe incompleteness than in the more external annuli 2 and 3 . in section [ sfr ]",
    "we will use the synthetic cmd approach , combined with artificial star experiments , to test if these lower ms stars are compatible with lmc field contamination or hide some older tons . to this aim",
    ", we also need to estimate the lmc contamination in a reference field ( see next section ) .",
    "\\2 ) in contrast to the innermost region 1 , annular regions 2 and 3 show a monotonic increase towards fainter magnitudes , with no intermediate peak before the final drop due to incompleteness . in terms of age",
    ", the lack of obvious tons means that regions 2 and 3 are not dominated by as young stars like in region 1 .",
    "nonetheless , at the magnitude of the region 1 peak , region 2 s lf has a mild excess of stars compared to region 3 , which would point to a poorly populated ton . as a further proof",
    ", the region 2 cmd also shows an excess of pms stars relative to region 3 .",

    "the rc is clearly visible in regions 1 and 2 ( at magnitudes 20.0@xmath320.3 and colors 1@xmath31.5 ) , while it is much more dispersed in 3 .",
    "all of these suggest a differential reddening that is higher in region 3 than in regions 1 and 2 .",
    "the technique of recovering the sfh of spatially resolved populations from their cmds ( e.g. @xcite ) has undergone continuous refinement and can now provide reliable sfhs for any resolved population within @xmath0 mpc ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these advances have been achieved because of improved models of stellar evolution , which are now computed for fine grids of stellar masses and metallicities and faster multi - cpu computing facilities , which allow one to perform extensive artificial star tests on the real images and to fully explore a wide parameter space .    a widely used approach consists of populating a 2d array of basic synthetic cmds generated from stellar models .",
    "each basic cmd is a `` fuzzy '' isochrone , with duration @xmath38 , fixed metallicity and an assumed imf . to compare the basic cmds and the observational counterparts , the models are convolved with photometric errors and incompleteness as derived from artificial star tests performed on the real images .",
    "the best superposition of the basic cmds defines the sfh and the age - metallicity relation , and is the one that minimizes the residuals from observational cmd .",
    "the approach adopted here is described in more details in the appendix .    despite the advances in this field , the derivation of the sfh from the cmd",
    "is often affected by systematic errors that are difficult to assess . from a theoretical point of view , several stellar phases are still uncertain ( thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch , pms , and post - ms for massive stars ) , while observationally differential reddening and highly variable incompleteness can be hard to treat .",
    "concerning ngc  2070 , and the general 30 doradus region , we face three major problems in trying to estimate the sfh : 1 ) membership errors due to field interlopers from the lmc field that mimic older populations ; 2 ) the extreme crowding conditions exacerbate the incompleteness , shortening the reachable look - back time ; 3 ) the high level of differential reddening spreads and dims the cmd , blending together young pms stars and older ms stars , which introduces further age ambiguities .          to measure the sfh of ngc  2070 we need to estimate the local field contamination .",
    "a typical approach is to decontaminate the cluster by subtracting the star - counts from a reference field .",
    "however , given reddening and incompleteness variations across the whole 30 doradus , it is impossible to find another direction replicating the observational conditions of ngc  2070 .",
    "a way out is to find a field that resembles as much as possible the lmc field _ we would observe without _",
    "ngc  2070 , which means low or negligible sf activity in the last 50 myr , minimal differential reddening and high completeness down to f555w@xmath39",
    ". this reference lmc field could be then artificially corrected for the more severe incompleteness and photometric errors of ngc  2070 .",
    "the resulting field would differ only in terms of normalization and differential reddening from the real lmc field contaminating ngc  2070 .",
    "finally , reddening and normalization of this field could be tuned together with the sfh of ngc  2070 until an adequate match of ngc  2070 s cmd is found .    as a first step we searched for low reddening areas around 30 doradus .",
    "a good tracer for extinction is the rc color .",
    "figure [ rc_spread ] shows the spatial distribution of rc stars , color coded according to the f555w@xmath3f775w color ( larger and redder symbols correspond to redder f555w@xmath3f775w ) .",
    "we find that , at odds with the smooth distribution of the entire rc sample ( see the bottom - right panel of fig .",
    "[ all_xy ] ) , redder rc stars are very concentrated along filaments and arcs , most likely tracing gas and dust in 30 doradus .",
    "this allows us to select extended regions , like the wide region just above ngc  2070 ( see the black box in the figure ) , with relatively blue rc stars . because these stars can not all be in the foreground",
    ", these regions must be low - extinction windows in the gas / dust layers of 30 doradus .",
    "interestingly , the aforementioned region is also poorly populated by pms stars ( see top - right panel of fig .",
    "[ all_xy ] ) , which implies minimal sf activity in the last 50 myr .    after a careful inspection of all regions with low extinction and pms number",

    "as expected , its rc and lower ms are much tighter than the general cmd , signatures of scarce differential reddening and young sf activity , respectively .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that residual differential reddening is still present .          to test the level of completeness of our photometric data and to have reliable estimates of photometric errors",
    ", we ran extensive artificial star experiments .",
    "the experiments consist of adding `` fake '' sources for each of the eight pass - bands , modeled with the psf used in the photometric analysis of the frames , onto the actual images .",
    "we then applied the same source detection routines used for our science images to the fields containing the combined actual images and the fake sources .",
    "we then determined the completeness fractions , defined as the ratio of recovered artificial stars to the number of the injected ones .",
    "we considered an artificial star lost if it is not recovered or if it is recovered being 0.75 mag brighter than its input magnitude .",
    "in fact , this means that it has fallen either on a real star brighter than the artificial star or one of its same brightness .",
    "thus , we are not recovering or measuring the artificial star but a real one instead .    to preserve the crowding conditions of the data ,",
    "fake stars were arranged in a spatial grid such that the separation of the centers in each star pair was larger than two psf radii .",
    "we found that a separation of 20 pixels guarantees that the probability of recovering a fake star is the same as it would be if we added only one fake star .",
    "the experiment is then repeated using a series of slightly shifted grids .    as an example of our fake stars procedure",
    ", the top panel of figure [ map50 ] shows the impressive 50% completeness map in the f555w band for a region 2000 pixel ( @xmath33 20 pc ) away from the cluster center ( 5 million fake stars ) .",
    "the bottom panel shows the corresponding real image .",
    "the most striking feature is the remarkable completeness variation , up to 8 magnitudes , in different locations within the region .",
    "regions like the broad area around x=10750 , y=13500 are photometrically complete at 50% level down to @xmath40 , whereas more crowded sub - regions , like the central area , are 50% complete only for @xmath41 .",
    "+     such variations are determined by the interplay of four major effects : photon scattering off dust in 30 doradus , continuum / line nebular emission , pixel saturation and stellar crowding .",
    "dust scattering and gas emission raise the background flux and , in turn , make it more difficult to resolve stars .",
    "the net result is visible in the diffuse `` nebulous '' areas of the completeness map ( see figure [ map50 ] ) .",
    "more localized than the dust and gas effects , pixel saturation produces the visible `` streaks '' ( charge - bleeding along the rows of the ccd ) extending off of many bright stars . finally , the extreme crowding conditions near r  136 are responsible for the central completeness `` hole '' ( where most of the injected fake stars are lost ) .",
    "we are not assuming any a priori reddening distribution .",
    "in principle we do not know where populations of different age are located _ inside _ ngc  2070 , so reddening is an unknown function of age . naively speaking , young massive stars may have carved the gas with their ionizing flux , hence lowering the extinction . on the other hand ,",
    "high levels of sf could be sustained only where the gas density is higher , which would lead to the opposite situation .",
    "besides , normalization and reddening of the reference field are also free parameters . furthermore , pms stars may appear reddened due to their local circumstellar material .",
    "when dealing with such a large parameter space ( age , reddening and field contamination ) there is uncertainty on whether the best solution is local or global . to cope with this we combined a genetic algorithm with a local search procedure ( hybrid - genetic algorithm , hga ;",
    "see appendix [ app ] for details ) which is more effective to avoid local trapping than local search alone . in our approach",
    "the first step is to store a library of `` basic '' synthetic cmds , where each cmd is a monte carlo synthetic population generated with a step - wise sf and reddening distribution .",
    "when the cmds are generated other population parameters like metallicity , distance modulus ( m@xmath3m)@xmath24 , slope of the imf and binary fraction q are kept fixed at 0.008 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , 18.5 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , @xcite and 30% , respectively .",
    "the extinction coefficients @xmath42 are taken from @xcite .",
    "the explored ages range from now up to 50 myr ago .",
    "since older isochrones tend to be more tightly packed in the cmd than younger isochrones , the duration of each age step increases with age from 1 myr ( at the present time ) to 20 myr ( 50 myr ago ) .",
    "the reddening is allowed to vary between 0 and 1 mag with a step of 0.05 mag .",
    "all `` basic '' synthetic cmds ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ basic_cmds ] ) are then degraded using the photometric errors and incompleteness as derived from the artificial star tests discussed in the previous section .",
    "once this basis is generated , any complex synthetic cmd can be constructed as a linear combination of the `` basic '' synthetic cmds . in order to take into account field contamination , the cmd of the reference field ( see section [ rc_sec ] ) is artificially reddened with steps of 0.05 mag between e(b@xmath3v)=0 and e(b@xmath3v)=1 to produce a complete basis of field cmds .",
    "likewise any kind of contamination can be simulated by linearly combining these `` basic '' field cmds ( see right panel of fig . [ basic_cmds ] ) .",
    "the only difference is that the `` basic '' field cmds are corrected for the _ difference _ in photometric errors and incompleteness as estimated in the field itself and in the ngc  2070 region , while the `` basic '' synthetic cmds are only corrected for the latter .",
    "however , since in the reference field completeness and photometric errors at f555w@xmath39 are 100% and @xmath43 of the error in sub - region a1 , the first correction is almost negligible .",
    "the combination of `` basic '' cmds ( both synthetic and field ) which minimizes the residuals from the observational cmd ( in terms of poissonian likelihood ) is searched with the hga code .",
    "the best coefficients tell us the most likely : 1 ) star formation rate as a function of time ( i.e. , the sfh ) ; 2 ) total reddening ( foreground @xmath44 internal ) as a function of time ; and 3 ) field contamination ( reddening and normalization ) .    _ which part of the cmd",
    "_ not all of the cmd is used to recover the sfh .",
    "our analysis is limited on the bright end by the saturation magnitude and on the faint end by the 50% completeness magnitude level . nonetheless , even with these conservative selections , the large variations of completeness with magnitude in some regions ( see upper plot in fig .",
    "[ map50 ] ) force us to derive the sfh in sub - regions within which the completeness is reasonably uniform .",
    "in fact , our artificial stars are uniformly distributed across the region , whereas real stars are concentrated in clumps and filaments , structures covering a minor fraction of the total area . as a consequence ,",
    "most of the stars will suffer a real incompleteness which is worse than the average measured with artificial stars .",
    "the division in `` iso - complete '' sub - regions mitigates this bias .",

    "we used all stars detected in both the f110w and f160w images inside each sub - region ( defined using the f555w data ) . in this case",

    "such uncertainties are the quadrature sum of a statistical error ( obtained by bootstrapping the data and re - deriving the solutions ) and systematic error ( obtained by re - deriving the solutions with different age - binnings and cmd binning scheme ) .    despite the different spatial resolution and reddening sensitivity , optical and nir predictions",

    "concerning the activity that commenced 20 myr ago , it is important to note that our sfhs have been obtained by taking into account field contamination , hence , unless we have been very unlucky in our field selection , it is reasonable to assume that this activity is a local extras over the lmc field .",
    "whatever the origin , its significance is low ( zero activity is still within 1-sigma error bars ) .",
    "focusing on the specific sub - regions , the sfh of region a1 shows a mild bimodality , with a minor peak around 5 - 7 myr ago and a major peak 1 - 4 myr ago ( 1 - 3 myr ago in the optical sfh , 2 - 4 myr ago in the nir one ) .",
    "the measured reddening distribution anti - correlates with sf : the average e(b@xmath3v ) is @xmath51 for stars with ages older than 7 myr , when the sf activity was lower , and @xmath52 for stars of younger ages , when the sf was stronger .",
    "optical and nir reddening derivations agree within errors , both in confirming the presence of notable differential reddening .",

    "the most important feature in the a2 sf is a pronounced peak in both optical and nir solutions 1 - 3 myr ago . like in sub - region",
    "a1 , the reddening of sub - region a2 is anti - correlated with the sf activity .",
    "the average reddening values are also very similar .    because of the high crowding we used only the optical cmd to derive the sfh of the most internal sub - region a3 .",

    "the total mass assembled in the regions a1 , a2 , and a3 , in the last 7 myr , is about @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "finally , our analysis does not involve the central core of ngc  2070 , where the activity is presumably much higher .",

    "one possible explanation for this mismatch is the 0.75 mag selection threshold that we used to reject artificial stars that are actually blended with real stars . relaxing this condition alleviates the issue , but also increases the scatter in the synthetic cmds more than what we see in the data .",
    "however , the impact of this effect should be minor in the magnitude range used for fitting .",
    "the simulation for sub - region a3 is in less good agreement with the observations . as is visible from the lfs ( see the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ cmd_synth_vi ] ) , the observed star counts systematically outnumber synthetic counts even at bright magnitudes ( f555ws@xmath62 ) .",
    "the straightforward explanation is to attribute the discrepancy to the incompleteness of the region , which is too inhomogeneous to be accurately modeled by our tests .",
    "however , from a physical point of view , it is also conceivable that the transition from pms to ms for intermediate / massive stars is not well reproduced by models . indeed , the major discrepancy is in the range f555w 18 - 19 , which corresponds to ton ages younger than 1 myr . if the pms evolutionary time for these objects is overestimated ( so more pms stars were predicted than observed ) or the pms birth - line ( the region in the cmd where stars are still embedded in their gas cocoons and , therefore , still invisible in optical bands ) is closer to the ms than predicted , any attempt to simultaneously fit pms and ms star counts will end up with a bias . in this case",
    ", the deficiency of ms stars could suggest that the sf rate for stars younger than 1 myr might be underestimated .",

    "these differences are principally due to the sf rate - imf degeneracy .",
    "the lack of stars of lower mass ( caused by the flatter imf ) is compensated with a higher early sf rate , whereas the lack of intermediate and massive stars ( caused by the steeper imf ) is compensated with a higher recent activity .",
    "we also found that the synthetic cmds corresponding to the @xmath70 and @xmath71 solutions systematically underestimate and overestimate , respectively , the star - counts for f555w@xmath72 ( the reverse for f555w@xmath73 ) .",

    "local activity is not distinguishable from the average activity in the lmc field ; * 7 myr ago - the sf accelerated throughout the entire region ; * 1 - 3 myr ago the activity reached a peak . in this time range , the sf moves from the periphery to the central regions .",

    "as shown in various papers ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , gas allow to find global optimum more efficiently than a local search alone . in our approach the synergy of the ga and a local search combines the advantages of both worlds . in the next sections we describe the synthetic population code and the optimization routine ( ga@xmath44local search )",
    "finally , the capabilities of the approach are tested with artificial data .",
    "the basic synthetic cmds@xmath98 are populated through the following monte carlo procedure : 1 ) synthetic masses and ages are extracted from the assumed imf and the j - th sf step , respectively ; and 2 ) synthetic masses and ages are converted to absolute synthetic magnitudes and colors by using a fine grid of isochrones . for our calculations we used the latest ( v.1.2s ) parsec isochrones , covering the entire mass spectrum of @xmath99 from the pms phase to the early - agb phase ; 3 ) a fraction q of synthetic stars is randomly chosen to have a companion .",
    "the masses of companions are extracted from the same imf and their flux is added to the flux of the primaries ; 4 ) the absolute synthetic photometry is put at the distance of the lmc and reddened with the k - th reddening . to produce realistic simulations , all basic cmds",
    "are degraded with photometric errors and incompleteness as estimated from artificial star tests ( see section [ artifix ] ) .    to have all stellar phases",
    "well populated , the synthetic cmds are generated with a large number of stars ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "once constructed , the basic cmds@xmath98 are binned in n bins of color and m bins of magnitude .",
    "the final result is a library of j@xmath79k 2d histograms cmd@xmath101 and any cmd can be expressed as a linear combination of these 2d histograms ( see equation [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath102 that multiply each of the cmd@xmath101 are the star formation rate at the time step j and reddening step k. the sum over j and k of @xmath103 provides the total star - counts predicted @xmath104 in the cmd bin ( m , n ) by the star formation @xmath102 . @xmath105\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] including the reference field in the models corresponds to changing equation [ eq1 ] into equation [ eq2 ] : @xmath106+\\\\+s_{f}(k)\\times f_{m , n}(k)]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where s@xmath107(k ) regulates the number of field stars with reddening k - th , while f@xmath108 is the actual number of stars in the reference field ( reddened with the k - th reddening ) in the cmd bin ( m , n ) .",
    "once the observational cmd is binned as well , the next step is to search for the combination of basic cmds that minimizes the cmd residuals between data and model .",
    "for this task we implemented a likelihood distance , whose minimization is not biased by low count statistics .",
    "the combination of basic cmds that minimizes the likelihood corresponds to the most likely sfh behind the data",
    ". the uncertainty around the recovered best solution will be the sum in quadrature of a statistical error , obtained through a data bootstrap , and a systematic error , obtained by re - deriving the sfh using different age - binnings and cmd - binning .    in our approach",
    "the likelihood is minimized with an hybrid - genetic algorithm ( hga ) , which combines a classical ga with a local search .",
    "pure gas are iterative probabilistic algorithms for solving a problem that mimic processes found in the natural biological evolution . compared to local search algorithms , gas",
    "explore the search space in more points simultaneously , hence they are far less sensitive to the initial conditions and show remarkable ability to escape from local minima",
    ". shortcomings of gas are the weak ability for local exploration and the slow convergence rate .",
    "the proposed hga aims to overcome both by alternating two phases : a ga , whose goal is to search for a quasi - global solution , and a local search , whose goal is to increase solution accuracy . the synergy of the two incorporates the exploration ability of gas and the exploitation ability of local search algorithm . for this study",
    "we implemented both _",
    "parallel _ and _ serial _ hybridization .",
    "the parallel one is applied to each iteration and aims at enhancing offspring likelihood by means of a local search before moving to the next generation .",
    "the serial one consists in applying a final local search after which the ga population has evolved to the region containing the global solution .",
    "to test our approach we have generated synthetic data with features resembling ngc  2070 ( 10000 stars brighter than f555w@xmath109 ) . to simulate the observational conditions ,",
    "this fake population is convolved with photometric uncertainties and incompleteness from the artificial star tests of ngc  2070 .",
    "the input sfh is a sequence of five bursts of different ages and duration 1 myr , while the input reddening distribution is built with 50% of the stars with e(b@xmath3v ) between 0.20 and 0.25 , and 25% between 0.25 and 0.30 , 25% between 0.15 and 0.20 .",
    "figure [ test ] shows the result of the reconstruction .",
    "the input sfh and reddening distribution are in black ; the best reconstructed counterparts in red .",
    "the recovered sfh looks like a smoothed version of the input sfh , due to the finite time resolution associated with the discrete nature of the data , and the ill - conditioned nature of mathematical inverse problems .",
    "however , overall , input functions are successfully recovered , with most of the differences within the uncertainties .",
    "moreover , a bursty sfh is recovered more accurately if the time gap between the individual bursts is longer ."
