    "market regulations , globalization , changes in the interest rates , war conflicts , new technologies , social movements , news and housing are only a small sample of factors affecting the chaotic and complex structure of the financial markets @xcite .    to assess all these interacting elements within a coherent theoretical economic framework to create a prediction model is , at least for now , a nearly impossible task .",
    "the behaviour of an economic system integrates a collection of emerging properties of chaotic and complex systems @xcite . from a deteministic approach ,",
    "the effort requiered to model and characterize a such system might be monumental .",
    "complex correlations in the fluctuations of financial and economic indices @xcite , the self - organization phenomena in market crashes @xcite , the sudden high growth or sharp fall in the stock market during periods of apparent stability @xcite , are only a few examples of situations that can be considered difficult to understand or represent mathematically .",
    "on one hand , from the stochastic - deterministic point of view of the physical statistics @xcite , the dynamic variation of prices in a financial market can be considered as a result of an enormous amount of interacting elements .",
    "for instance , stock prices are the result of multiple increments and decrements that result from a feedback response of every action defining the composition of an index , which result , at the same time , from decisions and flows of information that change from one moment to the next @xcite . for this reason , a detailed description of each trajectory , within the structure of a system ,",
    "would be almost imposible and futile : the series of events that gave birth to a specific trajectory might not repeat , and a detailed description would not have a predictive utility .    on the other hand , by considering axiomatic that we are unable to reach a deterministic understanding of a system as whole , a statistical approach might be useful tu describe the uncertainty involved . at least we would be able to gain some insight about the expected behaviour , size of fluctuations , or the corresponding probabilities of rare events .",
    "this , with the final intention of doing forecasts on the process future behaviour .",
    "the statistical description may even predict in an essentially deterministic way , such as the diffusion equation which describe the density of particles , each one performing a random walk in a microscopic scale @xcite .",
    "according to web portal of mexican stock exchange , `` the prices and quotations index ( mexbol ) is the mexican market s main indicator , it expresses the stock market return according to the prices variations of a balanced , weighted and representative constituent list of the equities listed in the mexican stock exchange , in accordance to best practices internationally applied '' @xcite .",
