    "this gives rise to questions about the classes of input states and measurements for which sampling the output distribution is classically intractable .",

    "in addition , a question of both fundamental and practical importance concerns the effect of imperfections on the classical intractability of sampling problems . there have been various investigations of the effect on boson sampling of imperfections in the  @xcite and of mode mismatching  @xcite .",
    "the present paper makes two contributions to this discussion .",
    "the first , developed in sec .",
    "[ sec : generic ] , is to formulate two sufficient conditions for efficient classical simulation of generic quantum - optics experiments : @xmath1  bosonic modes prepared in an arbitrary bosonic state undergo an @xmath1-mode ( trace - preserving ) quantum process ; one generates samples by making a measurement on the @xmath1 output modes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gen - cir ] ) .",
    "the first condition is based on expressing the probability distribution of the measurement outcomes in terms of a  for the output state of the process and s of the elements of the positive - operator - valued measure ( povm ) that describe the output measurement . if the  of the output state can be efficiently computed and if for some operator orderings all the s are nonnegative , then efficient classical simulation of sampling is possible .",
    "our second condition generalizes a previous no - go theorem  @xcite , which was given in terms of the wigner function , and it is particularly useful when one can not efficiently compute the  of the output state . for this condition",
    ", we derive a relation that decomposes the output probability distribution into three parts : a  for the phase - space complex amplitudes of the input state ; a transition function associated with the quantum process , which is a conditional  for the output complex amplitudes of the process given the input complex amplitudes ; and s of the measurement povm elements .",
    "if specific operator orderings exist such that all these s  input , transition , and output  are efficiently describable and nonnegative , sampling from the output probability distribution can be efficiently simulated classically .",
    "these conditions show that negativity is a necessary resource for a generic quantum - optics experiment not to be efficiently simulatable ; the result includes boson sampling as the special case where the quantum process is a  .",
    "we emphasize that efficient classical simulation might still be possible using other methods even if our conditions are not satisfied .    our second contribution , developed in sec .",
    "[ sec : bosonsampling ] , is to apply the results of the first one to investigate the effects of imperfections on implementations of boson sampling that use single - photon states  @xcite or two - mode squeezed - vacuum states  @xcite as inputs and photodetection at the output .",
    "the imperfections we consider are loss and mode mismatching at the input to and within the  and subunity efficiency and random counts in the photodetectors .",
    "considering simple models for these errors , we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the relevant s to be nonnegative , and thus for such boson - sampling implementations to be efficiently simulated classically using these methods .",
    "these conditions say that an experiment can be classically simulated when the probability of random counts per photodetector exceeds some threshold in the experiment .",
    "the various sources of error we consider are not completely independent .",
    "the _ random counts _ at the photodetectors include both intrinsic dark counts and counts due to mode - mismatched photons , i.e. , nonoverlapping parts of photon wave packets .",
    "these mode - mismatched photons are lost to the interference that gives rise to the desired output photocount distribution .",
    "they are part of the losses within the apparatus , but they can make their way through the  to the photodetectors and be counted within the spatiotemporal windows of the detectors .",
    "they thus contribute essentially random counts within the photodetectors .    as we discuss in secs .",
    "[ sec : bssinglephotons ] and  [ sec : bsspdc ] , our conditions for classical simulatability are not a challenge for situations with practical losses and high - quality photodetectors , _ if _ the only source of random counts is the intrinsic dark counts in the detectors .",
    "the chief challenge for boson sampling , we believe , comes when a substantial number of mode - mismatched photons reach the detectors and are counted as random counts .",
    "a good , but not exact rule of thumb is that our methods can classically simulate a boson - sampling experiment when the number of mode - mismatched photons reaching the photodetectors exceeds the number of mode - matched photons .",
    "the analysis in secs .",
    "[ sec : bssinglephotons ] and  [ sec : bsspdc ] suggests that this is an important challenge for implementations of boson sampling of interesting size , i.e. when the size of the system is sufficiently large to represent a challenge for a classical computer to sample .",

    "if such classical simulation is possible , then using stockmeyer s approximate counting algorithm  @xcite , one can approximate the output probability to within a multiplicative error in @xmath14 , which is contained in the third level of the polynomial hierarchy ; @xmath15 approximates @xmath16 to within a multiplicative factor @xmath17 if @xmath18 .    ideal boson sampling is a special case of this general problem , for which the input state is a multimode fock state with @xmath0 single photons , the quantum process is a lossless lon described by an @xmath19 unitary matrix @xmath20 with @xmath2 , and photon - counting measurements are made on each output mode .",
    "the output probabilities , in general , are proportional to the squared modulus of permanents of complex matrices , which are , in the likely event of single - photon detections , submatrices of @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "computing permanents is a difficult problem , known to be # p hard  @xcite , and in a class that contains the entire polynomial hierarchy of complexity classes  @xcite .",
    "the key observation by aaronson and arkhipov ( aa ) was that multiplicative approximation of the squared modulus of permanents of real matrices is also a # p - hard problem , and it is likely this is the case for general complex matrices  @xcite .",
    "if boson sampling were classically simulatable , one could use stockmeyer s approximate counting algorithm to approximate the output probability to within a multiplicative error , and this would lead to the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy to the third level , which is thought to be unlikely  @xcite . given two plausible conjectures ,",
    "aa further showed that it is likely that classical simulation of sampling from probability distributions that closely approximate the ideal output probability , known as _ approximate _ boson sampling , is also hard .",
    "the approximate sampling problem is of more practical interest than _ exact _ sampling because in an experiment the input quantum state , quantum process , and output measurement are only characterized approximately , so one does not sample from the exact probability distribution ( [ eq : gen - pro - dis ] ) .",
    "moreover , one might not be able to distinguish efficiently sampling from two probability distributions that are close to one another .",
    "hence , in practice , an interesting sampling problem is the one for which approximate sampling is hard . in this paper",
    ", we do not consider this form of sampling ; instead we focus on simulating exact sampling from output distributions that arise in the presence of errors and imperfections . even though we do not consider approximate sampling explicitly",
    ", our simulation methods for exact sampling do lead to a sufficient condition for approximate sampling to be classically simulatable .",

    "an obvious question is why our method needs random counts for classical simulability .",
    "the answer is that in the absence of random counts , sampling from the ( exact ) output probability distribution can not be efficiently simulated classically ; this can be shown using stockmeyer s approximate counting algorithm . even for large losses , it is still possible that all the input photons get counted by the detectors at the output . as any lossy  can be thought of as part of a larger , lossless , probabilities of these events are proportional to the squared modulus of permanents of complex matrices , which are submatrices of a unitary matrix for the larger . if sampling were classically simulatable , using stockmeyer s approximate counting algorithm one could approximate one of these probabilities to within a multiplicative error in @xmath14 [ stockmeyer s algorithm allows for the proportionality factors to be of the order @xmath201 ; this would lead to the collapse of polynomial hierarchy to the third level because as observed by aaronson and arkhipov , multiplicative approximation of these probabilities is # p hard .",
    "note , however , that this argument does not imply that boson - sampling experiments with losses and very low random counts are still practically interesting .",
    "one can expect that above some threshold for losses , a classical algorithm can efficiently generate samples from an approximate probability distribution , and in practice , this can not be distinguished from the outcomes of the experiment .",
    "the importance of random counts prompts us to return to the question of mode mismatching at the input to and within the .",
    "mode mismatching occurs when temporal , frequency , and polarization properties of photon wave packets do not overlap ideally at the input to the  and at the optical elements used to implement a specific .",
    "the nonoverlapping parts of the photon wave packets are lost to the ideal interference that leads to the probability distribution one wants to sample at the output .",
    "mode mismatching is thus a loss mechanism and is likely to be the dominant loss mechanism within a large optical network . without some intervention ,",
    "however , nonoverlapping parts of the photon wave packets continue through the  and are counted within the temporal and spatial windows defined by the photodetectors .",
    "these photocounts are effectively random and contribute to the random - count probability of the detectors ( they might be correlated between different output modes , but it is hard to see how this correlation could be used to our advantage ) ; indeed , they are very likely to be the dominant contribution to the random - count probability , as in high - quality detectors , the intrinsic dark - count rate is very low .    in principle , one can use active filters ( mode cleaners ) to remove nonoverlapping parts of photon wave packets at the input to and output from and perhaps within the  and , hence , to turn mode mismatching into a genuine loss where the mode - mismatched parts of the photon wave packets do not contribute counts at the photodetectors . to assess",
    "how serious this problem is , suppose that mode mismatching is the dominant loss mechanism .",
    "suppose further that a fraction @xmath202 of the photons lost at the input , numbering @xmath203 , continue into the  and on to the photodetectors and that a fraction @xmath204 of the photons lost within the , numbering @xmath205 , continue to the detectors .",
    "assuming these mode - mismatched photons are counted with efficiency @xmath159 , they contribute random - count probability @xmath206.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the same assumptions and same values for loss parameters as above , we now also assume that @xmath207 , on the grounds that the input loss @xmath180 already reflects a major attempt to clean up the input wave - packet modes , and @xmath208 , on the grounds that it would be quite difficult to clean up the output photons without introducing additional losses . with these assumptions ,",
    "we get @xmath209 for @xmath184 , @xmath210 for @xmath190 , and @xmath211 for @xmath196 . comparing these random counts with the corresponding thresholds from the previous page",
    "indicates that mode mismatching is indeed a challenge for boson - sampling experiments of interesting size ; recall that this assumes that additional single photons are fed into the  to compensate for losses in order keep the number of detected photons as close to @xmath176 as possible .",
    "the scaling with @xmath1 is such that if large s can be constructed without compromising the loss parameters , the situation gets better as @xmath1 increases .    it is worth noting that for the range of parameters we have considered , for which @xmath212 , the condition for classical simulatability is that the number of mode - mismatched photons counted at the photodetectors , @xmath213 , exceed the number of mode - matched photons , @xmath214 .",
    "this is a useful rule of thumb for assessing the simulatability of a boson - sampling experiment .",
    "a major practical challenge for implementing boson sampling is reliable single - photon sources . in most quantum - optics experiments ,",
    "spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) is used as a probabilistic source for preparing single photons  @xcite .",

    "this scheme can be viewed as sampling from the output photon - counting probability distribution of a larger  with @xmath215 modes ; the larger  consists of the identity process acting on the heralding modes and the original  acting on the signal modes .",
    "this scenario implements _ randomized _ boson sampling , in which when @xmath0 photons are randomly detected in the heralding modes , @xmath0 single photons are injected into the corresponding ports of the original  .",

    "we consider the following sources of error : mode mismatching of the signal modes into the smaller , signal - mode , described by virtual beamsplitters with transmissivity @xmath142 ; losses in the signal - mode , described by the transfer matrix @xmath101 , but no losses for the heralding modes , so that the overall transfer matrix is @xmath220 ; and for all modes , the model for random counts and inefficiency that we introduced previously for on - off detectors .",

    "it is notable that these thresholds are close to twice those we found under comparable conditions for single - photon boson sampling ; the single - photon thresholds would be higher if the single - photon sources produced photons with no impurity ( @xmath275 ) .",
    "as in single - photon boson sampling , spdc boson sampling suffers from the problem of mode - mismatched photons becoming random counts in the photodetectors . the same analysis as for single - photon boson sampling yields random - count probability  ( [ eq : pdeff ] ) with @xmath275 . again assuming @xmath276 and @xmath277 , with all the other parameters the same as above , the random - count probability is @xmath278 for @xmath184 , @xmath279 for @xmath190 , and @xmath280 for @xmath196",
    "this indicates that mode mismatching is a challenge for spdc boson - sampling experiments of interesting size . just as for single - photon sources",
    ", this conclusion assumes that additional photons are input to compensate for losses , but again the scaling is favorable provided one can keep losses and mode mismatching under control as system size increases .",
    "in this paper we established sufficient conditions for efficient classical simulation of general quantum - optical experiments that involve a quantum state that is subjected to an @xmath1-mode quantum process and measurement at the output of the process .",
    "these conditions support the notion that negativity is a quantum resource by showing that efficient classical simulation of sampling from the output probability distribution is possible when there are ( i )  nonnegative output - state and output - measurement quasiprobability distributions or ( ii )  nonnegative input - state and output - measurement quasiprobability distributions and a nonnegative transition function associated with the quantum process .",
    "we applied our conditions for classical simulability to two implementations of the boson - sampling problem .",
    "we considered simple models of errors and imperfections to assess the effects of mode mismatching , loss in the , and inefficiency and random counts of on - off photodetectors .",
    "we found that these errors have a significant impact and obtained random - count thresholds beyond which efficient classical simulation is possible .",
    "for any actual implementation of boson sampling , however , one should go beyond the simple examples given here and use our methods to model all the imperfections , noise , and errors , particularly , formulating and analyzing a detailed model of losses and mode mismatching within the particular , in order to determine when it is possible to do classical simulations using our methods . in the case of mode mismatching ,",
    "nonoverlapping parts of photon wave packets that proceed to and are counted at the detectors are likely to be the major contribution to the random - count probability ; hence , it is particularly important to assess the need for and effectiveness of active mode cleaning ( so - called quantum filters ) to mitigate this effect .",
    "we caution that we do not warrant that there is no other method of efficient classical simulation when our conditions are not satisfied .",
    "indeed , we have only considered the problem of sampling from the exact output probability distribution of measurement outcomes .",
    "a more general problem is approximate sampling , i.e. , sampling from a close approximation to the exact probability distribution , in which case the question is whether sampling from the approximate distribution can be efficiently simulated classically .",
    "we have shown that in the presence of losses in boson - sampling experiments and with zero or very low random counts , the exact sampling problem can not be simulated using our methods . yet , under the same conditions , one might be able to simulate approximate sampling . a possible approach might be to simulate sampling from a nonnegative distribution that approximates a slightly negative quasidistribution , perhaps using techniques like those recently introduced for discrete - variable systems  @xcite . we leave this as a subject for future research .",
    "several lessons might be drawn from our work in this paper .",
    "first , in any protocol that uses probabilistic state preparation , the state preparation should be included when one searches for efficient classical simulations .",
    "if classical simulation is possible for sampling from the whole distribution , then it is also possible for sampling from a subdistribution that is chosen by postselection .",
    "this is the approach we used in our analysis of spdc boson sampling , where we included the heralding modes explicitly in the search for a classical simulation .",
    "second , our random - count thresholds are hard boundaries .",
    "these hard boundaries might be moved closer to the ideal problem by considering approximate sampling , as discussed above , but the point here is that such hard boundaries might not be found by considering perturbations about an ideal protocol .",
    "this might be a general property of analogue quantum protocols like boson sampling .",
    "a third lesson is that it is generally easier to devise analogue quantum protocols than it is to show that the protocol does not have an efficient classical simulation .",
    "confronted with a new analogue quantum protocol , the responsibility of theorists and experimenters alike is to put on the classical thinking cap and to focus on whether classical simulations are possible in the presence of noise ; this is essential for designing experiments that are meaningful implementations of the quantum protocol .",
    "our methods for classical simulation are based on the wave aspects of boson - sampling experiments , as opposed to the particle aspects",
    ". one classical analogue of boson sampling replaces the identical input bosons with classical distinguishable particles undergoing probabilistic transitions within a network ; in this situation , output probabilities are given by permanents of matrices with nonnegative elements  @xcite . in contrast , in our methods , we deal with waves undergoing interference within a  and try to mimic quantum mechanics by using quasiprobability distributions to translate from particle inputs and particle measurements to the complex amplitudes of interfering waves .",
    "this is a natural way to try to simulate an analogue quantum protocol like boson sampling .",
    "we close by noting that the mode - mismatched photons that make their way to the detectors , which we identify as the chief challenge for boson sampling , are effectively the distinguishable photons of a particle description .",
