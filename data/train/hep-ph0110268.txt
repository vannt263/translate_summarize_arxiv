    "recently the clas collaboration at jlab has published new data on @xmath3- and @xmath4-meson photoproduction at large momentum transfers @xcite .",
    "the main goal of these data is to provide understanding for the mechanism responsible for the violation of the ozi rule in strong interactions @xcite .",
    "the usual approach to the description of exclusive reactions consists in the use of some effective non - perturbative reaction model at small momentum transfers and hard perturbative gluonic exchange mechanisms at large momentum transfers @xcite .",
    "these approaches are unable to explain the large spin effects at large @xmath5 in exclusive reactions @xcite .",
    "one example is the large @xmath6 asymmetry in proton - proton elastic scattering which can be understood only if some helicity violating contribution is present at such momentum transfers .",
    "the pqcd exchanges in these approaches lead only to quark helicity conserving contributions and therefore can not be the dominant mechanisms for exclusive reactions in the few gev region .",
    "we have proposed a non - perturbative mechanism @xcite for exclusive reactions at large momentum transfers , whose relevance we have studied in @xmath4 meson electromagnetic production at large momentum transfer , which we here generalize to @xmath3- and @xmath7-meson photoproduction off the nucleon .",
    "the new ingredient of our model is the gluonic contribution arising from the qcd mechanism associated with the flavor singlet axial anomaly and describable in terms of an additional gluonic pole in the amplitudes .",
    "the gluonic pole was introduced in @xcite to describe features of ozi violation in the pseudoscalar meson nonet .",
    "it has been shown to provide a natural explanation of proton spin @xcite .",
    "recently , applications to radiative decays of pseudoscalar mesons , the muon anomalous magnetic moment and the determination of the photon structure @xmath8 function in polarized deep inelastic scattering have been discussed @xcite .",
    "the origin for this pole is the periodicity of qcd the potential as a function of the topological charge and the existence of instantons tunneling between the various classical vacua of the theory @xcite .    by showing the relevance of the gluonic pole exchange in vector meson photoproduction at large momentum transfers ,",
    "we unveil a non - perturbative qcd effect , which is neither contained in the low energy effective theories nor in the pqcd ingredients of previous calculations .",
    "it is very well known that at large energy and small momentum transfer the main contribution to the photoproduction of the vector mesons comes from the pomeron exchange . in the low energy region",
    "one can expect the dominance of the pomeron at small @xmath5 only for @xmath4 meson electromagnetic photoproduction due to ozi rule . for @xmath3 and @xmath7-meson production",
    "the contribution from secondary reggeon exchanges might be important . in the case of photoproduction the leading regge trajectory with appropriate quantum numbers",
    "is the @xmath9 meson trajectory .",
    "subleading regge exchanges , which might give a significant contribution , are @xmath10-meson exchange for @xmath3- and @xmath7-meson production and @xmath11-meson exchange for @xmath4-meson production @xcite ( fig.1a ) .",
    "we use the donnachie - landshoff ( dl ) model @xcite to describe the soft pomeron contribution to the vector meson production differential cross section ,    @xmath12    where    @xmath13    is the electromagnetic nucleon form factor .",
    "the pomeron - quark couplings @xmath14 gev@xmath15 , @xmath16 gev@xmath15 are obtained from a fit to the total @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 cross sections @xcite , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and the pomeron trajectory is @xmath22 , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 gev@xmath25 .",
    "the effect of the @xmath9 trajectory can be taken into account by multiplying the equation for the pomeron contribution eq.([cross3 ] ) by the factor @xmath26    with    @xmath27    where the @xmath9 trajectory is @xmath28 , and the coupling to quarks @xmath29 was taken also from the dl fit to the total hadron cross sections @xcite .    the contribution of the pseudoscalar exchange to the cross section can be calculated by using the same procedure as in the dl approach to the pomeron contribution @xcite - meson with the @xmath30 and @xmath31 quarks because its contribution to @xmath3 and @xmath7-meson production is much smaller than the contribution of the @xmath10-meson . ]",
    "direct calculation of the triangle diagram in fig.2 @xcite since one has large uncertainties in the estimates due to the poor knowledge of the @xmath32 form - factors .",
    "] at the quark level with the quark - meson interactions @xmath33 gives the result @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and we have used the constituent quark relations @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    for numerical estimates the value @xmath41",
    "@xcite for pion - nucleon and the @xmath42 value @xmath43 for @xmath11-nucleon coupling @xcite have been used . in eq.([ps ] ) the pseudoscalar - nucleon form - factor is taken of monopole form @xmath44 with @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the reggeization of the pseudoscalar meson exchange can be perform in the standard way ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "it is done by substituting the pseudoscalar propagator in the following way , @xmath46 the pseudoscalar trajectories are taken as @xmath47 with slope @xmath48 .",
    "it can be shown that the effect of reggeization leads to the multiplication of eq.([ps ] ) by the regge factor @xmath49    the pomeron contribution to vector meson photoproduction is shown in figs . 3 , 4 and 5 by long - dashed lines .",
    "it underestimates the low @xmath5 cross - section for @xmath3 and @xmath7 production at jlab energies but describes rather well the low @xmath5 @xmath4-meson production .",
    "the total contribution of the dl pomeron and @xmath9 exchange to the cross section for @xmath3 and @xmath7 photoproduction is presented in figs . 3 and 4 by dashed - dot lines . the contribution of the pion exchange in figs . 3 and 4 and @xmath11-meson exchange in fig .",
    "5 is shown by short - dashed line .",
    "it is apparent that pseudoscalar exchange is important only for @xmath7 production at very small momentum transfers .",
    "our result is in contradiction with the result of ref .",
    "@xcite where a nonreggeized pion exchange contribution to vector meson production was calculated . in our approach the suppression of the pseudoscalar contribution at large @xmath5 is not very sensitive to the @xmath5 dependence of the @xmath50 and @xmath51 form - factors and the absolute value of the pseudoscalar coupling with quarks .",
    "this suppression is due to the smallness of the regge factor @xmath52 in the cross - section for large @xmath5 .",
    "the effect of the reggeization for the case of the @xmath10 contribution to @xmath3 production is shown in fig .",
    "this effect is very large and can not be neglected .",
    "the pomeron and regge contributions describe the data for all mesons rather well in the small @xmath53 gev@xmath54 region .",
    "however , for large @xmath55 gev@xmath54 , all these contributions deviate strongly from the data .",
    "in our previous work @xcite a new gluonic , so - called @xmath56-pole , exchange was introduced to explain the large @xmath5 electromagnetic @xmath4 meson production at jlab .",
    "this exchange , not related to the exchange of any mesonic state , arises from the nontrivial topological structure of the qcd vacuum . in some sense",
    "this exchange represents the interaction of the quarks in the photon with the quarks in the proton generated by the excitations of the qcd vacuum .    in qcd the anomalous gluonic",
    "axial current @xmath57 has a massless pole @xmath58 which is related to the topological susceptibility of the qcd vacuum @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the density of topological charge .",
    "this pole has been called the gluonic ghost pole @xcite in the literature and @xmath56-pole by us @xcite .",
    "the diagonalization of the propagator matrix for the ghost operator @xmath61 and quark nonet states @xmath62 and @xmath63 leads to the following propagator @xmath64 which we called @xmath56-propagator .",
    "@xmath65 in eq.([ghost ] ) is determined by the topological susceptibility of qcd vacuum @xcite @xmath66    we should stress that the @xmath56-propagator eq.([ghost ] ) does not depend on the momentum transfer @xmath67 and therefore the effective interaction induced by the ghost exchange is _ point - like_. this property is responsible for the large @xmath56-pole contribution to vector meson photoproduction at large momentum transfers as will be shown next .    let us estimate the contribution of @xmath56-pole exchange to vector meson photoproduction ( fig.1b ) . to calculate this diagram the values of couplings @xmath68 and @xmath69 are needed .",
    "we will use the fact that the contribution of the @xmath56-pole to the physical amplitudes in the flavor singlet channel leads to results which are different from the predictions of the ozi rule .",
    "this mechanism produces , for the isosinglet axial - vector nucleon form factor at zero momentum transfer , the following generalized @xmath70 golberger - treiman relation @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 mev and @xmath68 is @xmath56-nucleon coupling constant .",
    "the experimental value of @xmath74 extracted from experimental data on nucleon spin - dependent structure function @xmath75 @xcite , allows us to estimate the value of @xmath56-nucleon coupling constant as @xmath76    the @xmath56-pole contribution to the @xmath77 decay has been discussed in @xcite where a modified formula for the effective coupling of the @xmath63 meson with photons has been obtained , @xmath78    let us consider the @xmath56-pole contribution to the @xmath79 coupling , where @xmath80 stands for @xmath81 , @xmath7 and @xmath4 .",
    "the interaction of the vector mesons with the quarks is assumed to be photon - like @xmath82 due to this vector meson - photon analogy the generalization of eq.([ggg ] ) to the case of the @xmath83 amplitude is straightforward @xmath84 where @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the values of @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 can be extracted from the experimental widths @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .    the vector meson couplings with quarks are not well known . in order to estimate them we use a constituent quark model calculation for the @xmath3 and @xmath7 couplings",
    "@xmath94 where @xmath95 is taken from @xcite and for the @xmath4 coupling we use the njl model prediction @xcite @xmath96 our final estimate for the @xmath56-vector meson couplings is @xmath97 gev@xmath98 , @xmath99 @xmath100 and @xmath101 @xmath100 .",
    "we are now ready to calculate @xmath56-pole contribution to vector meson photoproduction .",
    "the absolute value of the @xmath56-contribution strongly depends on its couplings with the nucleon , photon and vector meson and is given by @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the flavor singlet axial form factor of the nucleon with the value of @xmath104 equals to the mass of the flavor singlet @xmath105-meson @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath56-exchange induces a nucleon spin - flip , which produces a factor @xmath106 in eq.([gcross ] ) , and leads to an additional enhancement of the @xmath56-pole contribution at large @xmath5 , with respect to the pomeron contribution , which is nonspin - flip eq.([cross3 ] ) .",
    "moreover the energy dependence of the @xmath56 contribution corresponds to that of a fixed pole with zero regge slope .",
    "therefore the large @xmath106 regge suppression in vector meson production given by @xmath107 with the slope @xmath108",
    "gev@xmath109 for the usual regge trajectories , e.g. @xmath110 and @xmath111 , is absent for the @xmath56-exchange .",
    "the result of the calculation of the @xmath56-pole contribution is presented in fig . 3 , 4 and 5 by the dotted lines .",
    "the sum of the pomeron , @xmath9 , @xmath110 , @xmath11 and @xmath56-pole contributions are shown by the solid lines .",
    "it is evident that @xmath56-exchange determines the behavior of the cross section at large @xmath5 and our model based only on pomeron , secondary regge exchange and @xmath56-pole contributions reproduces the main features of a data .",
    "the deviation from data at intermediate values of @xmath5 might be related to additional contributions from the pomeron and regge cuts or to non - linear @xmath106 dependences of pomeron and @xmath9 trajectories@xcite .",
    "the gluonic degrees of freedom play a very important role in the @xmath3- @xmath7- and @xmath4-meson photoproduction at jlab energies . at small @xmath5 the cross - section",
    "is described rather well by the donnachie - landshoff soft pomeron and secondary regge exchanges .",
    "at large @xmath5 an extremely interesting phenomena , related to the complex structure of qcd vacuum , takes place .",
    "we have shown that at large momentum transfers , the point - like interaction induced by the @xmath56- pole exchange , related to ghost pole in the correlator of the anomalous gluonic axial currents , gives the dominant contribution .",
    "we should stress that vector meson photoproduction is only one of the possible exclusive processes where the @xmath56-pole contributes .",
    "we plan to extend our considerations here to the study of other reactions at large momentum transfers .",
    "as has been mentioned the g - pole exchange leads to a nucleon helicity flip and therefore can be separated from the helicity conserving pqcd hard gluonic exchanges in processes with polarized particles .",
    "recently we have shown that at large energy and large momentum transfer a new anomalous trajectory with very large intercept @xmath112 and very small slope @xmath113 called @xmath114 is needed to explain elastic @xmath17 , @xmath115 and vector meson production at hera @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to find a relation between this @xmath114 trajectory and the @xmath116 exchange similarly as was discussed recently for the relation between pomeron and s - channel multi - glueball @xmath117 exchange @xcite .",
