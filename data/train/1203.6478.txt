    "the visible matter in the universe contains structure on a wide range of scales , from stars and planets ( @xmath4 m ) to voids and super - clusters ( @xmath5 m ) , ( see e.g.   @xcite ) . in standard general relativistic cosmological",
    "modelling the problem of dealing with this complexity is often circumvented by assuming that the stress - energy tensor of an inhomogeneous universe can be approximated by an ` averaged ' stress - energy tensor , usually assumed to be representable by a simple perfect fluid , while leaving the left hand side of einstein s equations unchanged .",
    "the solution to these equations is then taken to represent the geometry of spacetime on the scale over which the averaging was performed .",
    "if this scale is large enough to result in a homogeneous and isotropic spacetime , then we will refer to this geometry as the `` background '' .",
    "the great benefit of this approach is the enormous simplification it entails , by allowing cosmology to be done on any scale , without having to worry about the enormously complicated task of taking into account the wide range of structures that exist in the universe .",
    "the drawback is that it is not always clear to what extent the expansion of space in the background geometry is representative of the large - scale expansion of space in the actual universe . for a given model , we will refer to the difference between these two things as `` backreaction '' , which can be considered as the influence of inhomogeneities at different scales on large - scale cosmological dynamics .",
    "as large - scale expansion can be related to observables such as luminosity distance and redshift @xcite , it is therefore the case that an understanding of backreaction could prove essential in achieving a fundamental concordance between theory and observations @xcite .",
    "this task becomes increasingly important given that observational cosmology is now starting to be able to make high - precision measurements of a variety of different astrophysical probes , including the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , type ia supernovae @xcite , and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite . when interpreted within the background of the standard cosmological model , these very different probes all suggest that the universe is at present undergoing a phase of late - time accelerated expansion . in a genuinely homogeneous and isotropic general relativistic universe filled with a perfect fluid , such behaviour is only possible if @xmath6 , with data currently being compatible with the presence of a cosmological constant with @xmath7 .",
    "the presence of such a fluid is problematic for a variety of reasons , requiring a fine - tuning of perhaps as much as @xmath8 part in @xmath9 .",
    "this immediately raises the question of whether the model we are using to interpret the data is adequate , a question which needs to be quantified in any case if we are to start performing `` precision cosmology '' @xcite .",
    "one particular aspect of this complicated problem is the degree to which dust ( a fluid without any self - interactions ) is appropriate for describing the matter content of the universe @xcite .",
    "this approximation treats gravitationally bound , extended objects ( such as galaxies , and clusters of galaxies ) as a medium that is parametrised by only a handful of continuous , and usually slowly varying , quantities . within this framework , the spacetime through which photons travel has a fundamentally different type of curvature to that of the real universe @xcite .",
    "it also ignores the gravitational consequences of the binding energies between and within astrophysical systems @xcite .",
    "a dust description should therefore be considered as an approximation only , and must itself be investigated in order to ascertain the extent to which it is justifiable .",
    "we study the problems outlined above by considering cosmological solutions that are explicitly composed of regularly arranged discrete masses .",
    "these solutions consist of vacuum everywhere exterior to the sources under consideration , and are constructed on a manifold that has spacelike hypersurfaces that are topological 3-spheres . as a result , they admit a group of discrete symmetries corresponding to rotations of the 3-sphere that leave the positions of the masses invariant .",
    "these models are among the simplest possible inhomogeneous spacetimes that could be considered to exhibit large - scale homogeneity and isotropy : they introduce only one extra scale into the problem ( the inter - particle separation ) , they are vacuum solutions of the field equations ( up to the singularities ) , and they contain within them a time - symmetric spatial hypersurface ( which greatly simplifies the constraint equations ) .",
    "this makes them ideal candidates for studying backreaction .",
    "cosmological solutions of this type have been considered before , starting with the seminal work of lindquist and wheeler @xcite .",
    "the approach these authors took was to construct a gravitational analogue of the highly successful wigner - seitz construction .",
    "the basic idea was to build lattices from regular cells , and attach the cell boundaries tangentially to a background 3-sphere .",
    "dynamics were then imposed by assuming that observers that are equidistant between neighbouring sources should be falling freely with respect to those sources .",
    "this led to a dynamical model of the universe in which the masses are regularly arranged , and that is taken to be an approximate solution to einstein s equations .",
    "the lindquist - wheeler approach has recently been extended to include models with spatially flat and open topologies @xcite , as well as to models with a cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "the optical properties of spatially flat models of this type have also been considered in @xcite , as have those of negatively curved models in @xcite .",
    "other attempts to construct cosmological models for similar configurations of discrete masses have been made using perturbative expansions @xcite , and regge calculus @xcite .",
    "while providing insights into the problem , all of the models mentioned above involve the use of approximate solutions .",
    "our aim here is to take an alternative approach to addressing this problem that is exact .",
    "this approach is based on work initiated by misner about five decades ago @xcite , and that has subsequently been used extensively in the study of black hole physics @xcite .",
    "the underlying idea here is again drawn from analogy with the study of electromagnetism , where intuitions about more general situations are gained by first studying the simple case of static configurations of charge . in gravitational settings , however , it is very difficult to arrange for configurations of isolated masses to be static for a finite interval of time .",
    "in contrast , configurations that are _ instantaneously _ static occur frequently .",
    "the study of such configurations , that occur in many systems of physical interest , is referred to as geometrostatics .    in the case of cosmology , which is our main interest here",
    ", an important example is provided by the instantaneously static ( and therefore time - symmetric ) hypersurfaces that occur at the moment of maximum expansion in dust - dominated flrw solutions with positive spatial curvature .",
    "our goal is to construct a set of instantaneously static configurations that are exact , and that contain discrete matter sources , rather than continuous fluids .",
    "we do this by constructing regular tessellations of a 3-sphere by using different sets of identical polyhedra , each with an identical mass at their centre .",
    "we show that the method of geometrostatics can be extended to solve the constraint equations _ exactly _ in these cases .",
    "our aim is then to use these solutions to study backreaction in dust filled cosmological models .",
    "we do this by comparing the time - symmetric spatial hypersurfaces of the exact discrete solutions to the corresponding flrw solutions with the same proper mass . ] , and considering , in particular , the extent to which the flrw solutions emerge as the number of sources is increased .",
    "this provides a _ precise _ indication of the degree to which flrw solutions can be used to represent initial configurations for spacetimes that contain discrete objects .",
    "a fuller investigation of backreaction along these lines would also include considering the dynamical evolution of models with discrete sources .",
    "we leave this for a future publication .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ 2 ] we recap on perfect fluid flrw cosmology . in section [ equations ] we provide the constraint equations on time - symmetric hypersurfaces for discrete masses on a 3-sphere .",
    "we discuss the schwarzschild solution , and then outline how to find the solution for arbitrarily many discrete masses in a closed space . in section [ sec1 ]",
    "we construct all of the possible solutions that consist of discrete sources regularly arranged on a closed lattice .",
    "this allows us to explain why there are no 2-mass solutions with spherical topology to einstein s equations that admit a time - symmetric hypersurface . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we provide evidence that shows that the sources in our discrete models are always separated by distances that are larger than their horizon sizes at the maximum of expansion . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we investigate backreaction in dust - dominated cosmological models by comparing the scale of our lattices to dust - filled flrw solutions of einstein s equations with the same total proper mass .",
    "we find that @xmath1 deviations from the results of friedmann cosmology can occur when the number of masses is small ( @xmath0 ) , but that the scale of the solutions converge to the friedmann values when there are very many masses ( @xmath2 ) . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we then consider what happens when we include inter - particle interaction energies in our definition of mass .",
    "we find that the consequences of changing the number of masses in the lattice , while keeping the total energy of the system the same , can considerably change the scale of the hypersurface of maximum expansion .",
    "this shows that although backreaction in dust models we consider is generically quite small , the consequences of ignoring interaction energies when using the dust approximation can hide potentially interesting effects .",
    "in section [ conclusion ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the spatially homogeneous and isotropic perfect fluid flrw solutions have a geometry given by ds^2= -f(t ) dt^2 + a^2(t ) ( d ^2 + h^2 ( ) d ^2 ) , where @xmath10 is a free function , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 or @xmath14 for solutions with spatial curvature @xmath15 , @xmath16 or @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the scale factor @xmath18 satisfies the constraint equation = - , where the dot represents a derivative with respect to @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the energy density of the continuous perfect fluid , which obeys the conservation equation + 3 ( + p ) = 0 , where @xmath21 is the pressure .",
    "this completely specifies the solution , up to constants of integration .    for the present study we will be primarily interested in models with positive spatial curvature ( @xmath15 ) , and with a pressureless dust source ( @xmath22 ) . in this case ,",
    "if we take @xmath23 , then the solution can be written as a(t ) = _ 0 - ( t - t_0)^2 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are constants , and where @xmath26 .",
    "the maximum of expansion can then be seen to occur at @xmath27 , and the geometry of the hypersurface @xmath27 can be seen to be given by [ flrwmax ] dl^2 = ( d ^2 + ^2 d ^2 ) , which is rigidly specified once @xmath28 , the energy density at maximum of expansion , is known .",
    "we note that the only dust - filled flrw solutions that admit a time - symmetric hypersurface are spatially closed , with a spherical topology .",
    "interestingly , the boundary conditions for discrete models with a momentarily static distribution of sources also seem to be incompatible with open topologies ( the reason for this is that a @xmath29 source can not live alone on @xmath30 , and a regular lattice of identical sources on @xmath31 is also not possible @xcite ) .",
    "this shows a certain qualitative concordance between discrete and fluid solutions in the interplay between boundary conditions and topology .",
    "our aim here is to obtain exact vacuum solutions of einstein s equations corresponding to regular lattices of sources that are instantaneously at rest on a topological 3-sphere .",
    "in such a setting the relevant equations to solve are the gauss - codazzi equations : @xmath32 \\label{gc2 } \\bigl ( k_{i}^{\\phantom{i }    j}-\\delta_{i}^{\\phantom{i } j } k\\bigr)_{\\vert j } & = & 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the ricci curvature of the 3-space , @xmath34 is the extrinsic curvature of the 3-space in the 4-dimensional spacetime , and @xmath35 .",
    "the indices @xmath36 , @xmath37 refer to coordinates in the 3-space , and the vertical line denotes covariant derivative in that space .    it is well known that if we choose a time coordinate that is specified by the normal derivative to this initial hypersurface ( such that @xmath38 ) , then the extrinsic curvature can be written as @xmath39 . instantaneously static hypersurfaces therefore have @xmath40 , and the gauss - codazzi equations reduce simply to [ gc3 ] = 0 .",
    "a key point here is that for any 3-dimensional geometry that satisfies the initial constraint ( [ gc3 ] ) there is a unique 4-dimensional spacetime that satisfies the full einstein equations .",
    "this is the method of geometrostatics , presented by misner in @xcite , and studied for the case of asymptotically flat space in @xcite .",
    "here we are interested in solving eq .",
    "( [ gc3 ] ) in closed spaces . in this case",
    "we can make the following ansatz for the metric of the spatial 3-section [ hh1 ] dl^2 = ^4 _ i j dx^i dx^j , where @xmath41 , and where @xmath42 is the metric of a 3-sphere with constant curvature @xmath43 .",
    "the gauss - codazzi equations are then satisfied if @xmath44 obeys the helmholtz equation : [ hh ] ^2 = , where @xmath45 is the laplacian corresponding to @xmath46 .",
    "the schwarzschild solution has been well studied using asymptotically flat solutions in geometrostatics , including in the original work of misner @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the schwarzschild solution is still a solution in the present case , as the 3-sphere is conformally flat . in this case , however , there will be a different radial variable and a different functional form for the conformal factor @xmath44 . given the linearity of the helmholtz equation , , it can be seen that multi - source solutions can be constructed by linear superposition of the solutions for single sources .    in",
    "asymptotically flat , isotropic coordinates , a static spacelike slice of the schwarzschild solution can be written as [ schw1 ] dl^2 = ( 1 + ) ^4 ( dr^2 + r^2 d^2 ) , where @xmath47 is a constant .",
    "performing the coordinate transformation @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a constant , it can be seen that eq .",
    "( [ schw1 ] ) becomes [ schw - spherical ] dl^2= 4 ^4 ( d^2 + ^2d^2 ) .",
    "this metric is clearly of the same form as eq .",
    "( [ hh1 ] ) , and solves eq .",
    "( [ hh ] ) , with @xmath50 ( for a unit 3-sphere ) and = ( 12 + ) .",
    "actually , both functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 satisfy eq .   with @xmath50 .",
    "this means that although the term in eq .",
    "( [ schw - spherical ] ) that corresponds directly to the @xmath53 source term from eq .",
    "( [ schw1 ] ) can be seen to be the one that is proportional to @xmath54 , the term that is proportional to @xmath55 can also be treated as a source , although it is located at the antipode .",
    "this becomes obvious if we place the origin of the spherical coordinates at the antipode by the transformation @xmath56 , as in that case the roles of the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ schw - spherical ] ) are interchanged ( i.e.  @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) .",
    "thus it appears that placing a schwarzschild source on the 3-sphere induces a mirror source at the antipode .",
    "furthermore , these two source terms are joined at their horizons , as is clear if we set the gauge parameter to @xmath59 ( in which case the horizon at @xmath60 appears at @xmath61 in the hyperspherical coordinates ) .",
    "one can then consider that as @xmath62 one approaches either the asymptotic region where @xmath63 , _ or _ that one approaches another schwarzschild mass .",
    "these two situations are geometrically identical , and there is therefore no difference between the one mass solutions and the two mass solution ( as long as the point at @xmath64 can be added to the manifold ) .      from eq .",
    "we can now infer that there exist multi - source solutions on the 3-sphere that take the form @xmath65\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is given by @xmath67 where the mass parameters @xmath68 are a set of constants and @xmath69 . here",
    "the @xmath70 refer to new coordinates @xmath71 which are obtained by rotating the coordinates @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ sphere_general ] ) so that the @xmath36th source position appears at @xmath73 .",
    "it follows from the form of eq . that one can not adjust the @xmath68 and the size of the 3-sphere independently .",
    "for example , scaling the size of the 3-sphere by a constant @xmath74 automatically results in scaling the @xmath68 by a factor @xmath75 .",
    "this demonstrates that there exists a certain rigidity in the configuration , once the @xmath68 are specified .",
    "specifying the value of the @xmath76 is therefore crucial for determining any measure of distance in our hypersurface .",
    "once they are specified , however , then all measures of distance can be calculated uniquely .    when considering the original single source schwarzschild solution , the parameters @xmath68 ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 in that case ) are equal to the standard schwarzschild mass , @xmath79 ( using the gauge @xmath59 ) .",
    "however , when multiple sources are present , the interpretation of the @xmath68 parameters will instead be that of an _ effective mass _ which includes the binding energies with respect to all the other objects in the universe ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . however , their actual , locally measured , _ _ proper mass _ _ must be determined by the requirement that the geometry reduces to that given by eq .",
    "( [ schw - spherical ] ) in the limit @xmath80 , in analogy with the asymptotically flat situation analysed in ref .",
    "it can be shown that the proper mass defined in this way is equivalent to the mass in the schwarzschild region at the other end of the einstein - rosen bridge of the black hole .",
    "to summarise , these two mass definitions are :    1 .   _ the effective mass _ , @xmath81 , is defined to be equal to the mass parameter of the corresponding source , @xmath82 .",
    "2 .   _ the proper mass _",
    ", @xmath83 , is defined in such a way that the geometry of the space in the vicinity of each object is given by eq .",
    "( [ schw - spherical ] ) , in the limit @xmath80 .",
    "strictly speaking , one requires a region to exist that is infinitely far away from all of the masses in order to have an operational definition of the gravitational effect of the inter - particle potentials that are included in the effective mass .",
    "this is clearly impossible in the case of a closed space , but this does not stop us from drawing an analogy with cases in which asymptotically distant regions do exist .",
    "using the above ingredients we can now construct a set of models with different numbers of regularly arranged discrete masses on a 3-sphere . to do this",
    "we proceed in analogy with the approach taken by lindquist and wheeler @xcite , so that our models are constructed by considering all of the possible regular tessellations of the 3-sphere .",
    "we then place identical masses at the centre of each cell , with the result that the distribution of masses is such that the distance between any mass and its nearest neighbours is the same for each of them .",
    "there are six possible regular tessellations of the 3-sphere , those with 5 , 8 , 16 , 24 , 120 and 600 polyhedra @xcite .",
    "in addition , one can also cover a hypersphere with 2 balls @xcite .",
    "these possibilities are displayed in table [ table1 ] . using these tessellations",
    ", we will now proceed to construct a sequence of exact discrete regular lattice models of the universe , with increasing numbers of sources , on a time - symmetric 3-sphere .",
    "our discrete models will consist of @xmath84 equal masses ( where @xmath85 ) . by positioning these masses at the centre of each of the cells , they are at a maximum possible distance away from each of their neighbours .    .",
    "_ _ all possible regular tessellations of the 3-sphere .",
    "the ` lattice structure ' is given by the schlfli symbols @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the number of edges to a face , @xmath88 is the number of faces that meet at a vertex , and @xmath89 are the number of cells that meet at an edge @xcite . _ _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ lwfig2a ] we compare the scale of the hypersurface of maximum expansion for each of our discrete solutions , when the total effective mass of the lattice is kept constant . as the effective mass includes the inter - particle interaction energies , this procedure of comparing the scale of solutions with the same total effective mass is equivalent to enforcing the condition that the lattices being compared should contain the same total energy ( that is , the same total proper mass plus interaction energies ) .",
    "[ lwfig2a ] then shows that the scale of the hypersurface of maximum expansion grows approximately linearly with the number of masses , @xmath84 .",
    "changing the method of determining the scale of the discrete solutions from d1 to d2 has very little effect .     for the 5-cell , and using d1 for the scale of the discrete solutions.,width=316 ]    [ lwfig2a ]    the results in fig .",
    "[ lwfig2a ] can be understood by considering fig .",
    "[ lwfig2 ]  as the number of masses decreases the ratio of the magnitude of interaction energies to proper mass also decreases .",
    "the interaction energies , however , are negative , so if we consider a thought experiment in which we deform the 8-cell into the 5-cell we have to _ increase _ the total amount of energy available for interactions . the only source of energy in the solution is the proper mass of the particles , and so a lattice with fewer masses must have a smaller total proper mass if the total energy in the system is to remain unchanged .",
    "smaller total proper mass corresponds to a smaller scale for the hypersurface of maximum expansion , as was shown in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "this result suggests that one can substantially increase the scale of a closed space by dividing up the mass in that space into smaller packets , although we have strictly only shown this is the case on time - symmetric hypersurfaces it should also be noted that this result relies on the definition of effective mass that we have generalized from the asymptotically flat setting in order to define the interaction energies .",
    "the validity of this approach is difficult to confirm operationally in a compact space , and so the interpretation of the dramatic increases in scale seen here should be treated with care .",
    "such increases in scale are entirely absent in dust models , as interaction energies are not included in the energy budget in that case .",
    "this does not , however , invalidate any of the conclusions of section [ sec2 ] .",
    "it remains the case that back - reaction is small in models where interaction energies are ignored .",
    "what has changed for the lattices in fig .",
    "[ lwfig2a ] is that the proper mass in each lattice is increasing as the number of masses is increased , so the dust - dominated flrw solution that one should compare with these models is also changed .",
    "we have studied the emergence of spatially closed friedmann solutions from inhomogeneous solutions that contain increasing numbers of regularly arranged discrete masses in topological 3-spheres .",
    "this has been done using exact methods , and therefore allows for exact measures of backreaction in dust dominated cosmological models .    more specifically , by considering the instantaneously static hypersurfaces at the moment of maximum expansion",
    "we have found that universes that contain only a small number of mass concentrations ( @xmath0 ) can be @xmath90 or more larger than the corresponding dust dominated flrw solutions of einstein s equations .",
    "however , for universes that contain very many masses ( @xmath2 ) there is very little quantitative difference ( @xmath91 ) between the scale of maximum of expansion in the discrete and continuous solutions .",
    "these results are based on comparing dust dominated continuous models ( which ignore the inter - particle interaction energies ) with momentarily static discrete models that contain the same total ` proper mass ' ( which also ignores the interaction energies between the different masses ) . while backreaction in this case is quite small , it may well be that the inter - particle interactions will come into play in a more substantive way when we allow for dynamics .",
    "that is , backreaction could still have a big effect when we consider the evolution of the universe .",
    "the results we find are in good keeping with the approximate solutions of lindquist and wheeler that use a gravitational analogue of the wigner - seitz construction @xcite , as is demonstrated graphically in fig .",
    "[ lwfig ] .",
    "they also present us with exact expressions for the change in scale of cosmological solutions that has been predicted using zalaletdinov s averaging scheme @xcite .",
    "more generally , we believe our study could allow some insight into the problem of how averaging should be performed in relativistic cosmology . to date , most studies on this subject have used either highly symmetric exact solutions that contain a perfect fluid , or have considered small fluctuations around an flrw `` background '' geometry .",
    "the former approach is strongly limited by the high degree of symmetry required in the solutions , while the latter is limited to geometries that are already necessarily close to flrw .",
    "the models we have constructed here suffer from neither of these shortcomings , as they admit no killing vectors , and do not require the assumption of an flrw geometry , either as a boundary condition for the inhomogeneities , or as a background geometry .",
    "as such it offers a new laboratory for testing ideas about inhomogeneity , averaging , and backreaction in cosmology .    with the notion of effective mass employed here , we find the interaction energy grows rapidly as the number of masses in the lattice , and comes to dominate in the limit of very many masses .",
    "this means that if we compare lattices with different numbers of masses , but with the same total energy ( including interaction energy ) , then the scale of the hypersurface of maximum expansion increases dramatically with increasing number of masses . as was discussed above , however , the interpretation of this effect requires some care , as it is based on a generalization of the definition of effective mass given by brill and lindquist in asymptotically flat settings .",
    "nevertheless , this effect is entirely neglected when treating the matter content of the universe as dust .    finally , in this paper",
    ", we have confined ourselves to the comparison of the discrete and continuous models on time symmetric hypersurfaces .",
    "clearly the next step would be to make a detailed comparison of the full evolution of these models .",
    "we shall return to this question in future publications .",
    "we also note that , although we have only considered regular arrangements of masses in this paper , the formalism we have used allows for the possibility of considering much more complicated distributions . .",
    "after submission of our manuscript the following related work appeared : @xcite .",
    "the first of the these papers performs a numerical analysis of a spatially flat lattice of black holes @xcite , while the second performs a perturbative analysis of a similar situation @xcite .",
    "the third study finds exact initial data for a lattice of eight black holes in a space with spherical topology ( using the same method presented in this paper ) , and then proceeds to numerically evolve this data @xcite . .",
