    "achieving an efficient coupling between a single quantum emitter ( qe ) and the surface plasmons ( sps ) supported by metallic nanostructures has become a popular subject of research due to its potential application to quantum - optics @xcite and sensing @xcite .",
    "this efficient coupling lies at the heart of several surface - based ultrasensitive optical analysis techniques , which rely on the plasmon - driven enhancement of raman scattering @xcite and infrared absorption @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the _ localized _ sps of a metal nanoparticle can enormously modify the spontaneous decay of a neighboring excited molecule @xcite , while _ propagating _ sps can produce similar effects over a broadband spectral range . reducing the dimensionality of the plasmonic structure from 2d ( metal surfaces ) to 1d ( thin wires ) enables better control over the coupling , which can be engineered to affect just a single sp @xcite .",
    "additionally , the sps of 1d geometries are well suited to act as mediators in the interaction between several qes placed in close proximity to a plasmonic waveguide @xcite , thus suggesting the combination of these tools to design large - scale quantum - optics integrated devices , which could benefit from the plasmon robustness against environmental fluctuations to operate under ambient conditions .",
    "the recent emergence of graphene as a plasmonic material @xcite has introduced an additional knob to improve the performance of qe - sp coupling .",
    "the large electrical tunability and high degree of confinement recently measured in graphene plasmons @xcite has stimulated suggestions for their use in tunable plasmonic circuitry and metamaterials @xcite , as well as for the achievement of quantum strong coupling and efficient interaction with qes @xcite with superior performance compared with conventional plasmonic metals .",
    "although these plasmons have been so far observed only at mid - infrared and lower frequencies , their extension towards the more technologically appealing spectral ranges of the visible and near - infrared has been argued to be attainable @xcite , particularly by reducing the size of the structures to scales of a few - nanometers , which are commensurable with existing graphene - related structures such as aromatic molecules @xcite and carbon nanotubes . in particular , nanotubes of tens of nanometers in diameter",
    "have been recently suggested as suitable elements for plasmon circuitry @xcite . it should be noted that swcnts , like other carbon allotropes , exhibit uv plasmons that have been well characterized in the past @xcite .",
    "however , those plasmons are much lossier , and therefore less prone to efficiently couple to qes , than the tunable lower - energy plasmons on which we concentrate here , which only exist in doped structures and are predicted to display similar electrical tunability as graphene .    in this paper",
    ", we show that quantum emitters can strongly couple to the electrically tunable plasmons of doped swcnts , reaching light - matter interaction levels that go even beyond those of planar graphene .",
    "the purcell factor ( i.e. , the decay rate near the material , normalized to the decay rate in free space ) is increased by nearly three orders of magnitude when reducing the dimensionality of the carbon nanostructure from 2d ( graphene ) to quasi 1d ( nanotubes ) .",
    "more importantly , the coupling efficiency of the qe to the sps supported by swcnts ( i.e. , the fraction of decay into plasmons , also known as @xmath1 factor ) reaches values nearing @xmath0 over a very broad range of qe - swcnt distances and qe / sp frequencies .     from the surface of a swcnt of radius @xmath5 .",
    "three orthogonal orientations of the emitter dipole @xmath6 are considered , as shown by the red arrows . ]",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] depicts the system under study : a single qe placed at a distance @xmath7 from the axis of a swcnt of radius @xmath5 .",
    "the emission properties of the qe are determined by its transition frequency @xmath8 and dipole moment @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that @xmath5 is sufficiently large as to neglect curvature effects ( i.e. , the discreteness of the electronic bands , as well as features near the dirac point associated with the tube chirality and finite radius ) .",
    "a recent study @xcite indicates that this approximation works well to describe transversal plasmons for @xmath9 nm under the doping conditions here considered ( see below ) , although narrower nanotubes require a more fundamental level of description @xcite .",
    "swcnts have been synthesized in this size range @xcite and their excitonic absorption bands well characterized @xcite .",
    "we thus model the swcnt as a hollow tube with the same surface conductivity @xmath10 as graphene doped with the considered number of charge carriers per carbon atom .",
    "this allows us to readily compare 2d graphene and 1d swcnts . for simplicity",
    ", we adopt the drude model , @xmath11 , with realistic values of the fermi energy @xmath12ev and the plasmon relaxation time @xmath13ps .",
    "importantly , the relative comparison between both materials is independent of the choice of @xmath14 .",
    "however , the high purcell factor here predicted ( see below ) is roughly proportional to the assumed @xmath14 . in this work",
    "we are most interested on situations in which both @xmath5 and distances @xmath7 are small compared with the light wavelength @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , the electrostatic limit here outlined , which leads to relatively affordable analytical expressions , provides a very accurate level of description , as shown below . a comparison between results obtained with the electrostatic approach and a full electromagnetic formalism @xcite is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , whereas both approaches give nearly identical results on the scale of figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "we start our analysis by considering the screened interaction @xmath16 , defined as the electric scalar potential created at the position @xmath17 by an oscillating point charge @xmath18 placed at @xmath19 .",
    "reciprocity implies that @xmath16 is symmetric with respect to the exchange of @xmath17 and @xmath19 .",
    "also , it is convenient to decompose @xmath20 as the sum of bare and induced interactions .",
    "this quantity allows us to obtain the plasmon characteristics , as well as the decay rate of a neighboring qe",

    "plasmon resonances are signaled by their strong response for a given external perturbation , or equivalently , by the poles of @xmath29 .",
    "here we should note that sign cancellations due to the @xmath30 modulation of the induced charge along the azimuthal direction of the tube surface render the contribution of @xmath31 modes small if @xmath7 is larger than the radius @xmath5 .",
    "we thus concentrate on the dominant @xmath32 plasmon band , whose complex wave vector @xmath33 is found as a function of frequency @xmath8 from the solution to the transcendental equation @xmath34 this dispersion relation agrees with previous studies that focus on the @xmath35 limit @xcite . in fig .",

    ", we also consider very large @xmath5 in order to also deal with graphene coated cylinders . in this way",
    ", this figure illustrates the evolution from small tubes to planar graphene with increasing @xmath5 . for comparison , we also plot the dispersion relation of the sps supported by a graphene sheet , clearly showing that plasmons propagating along carbon nanotubes are more confined ( larger @xmath36 ) than those supported by graphene , and their confinement increases with decreasing @xmath5 .",
    "this suggests that swcnts are better suited to produce enhanced coupling with qes . as discussed above , the electrostatic limit yields very accurate results for nanotubes of small radius ( @xmath41 nm ) , and also for larger radius at short wavelengths .    the ratio between the real and imaginary parts of @xmath33 is also an important magnitude , typically used as a figure of merit ( fom=@xmath42 ) for evaluating the propagation characteristics of sps .",

    "[ fig3 ] ) for the corresponding optimal qe - dipole orientations ( @xmath58 for swcnts and perpendicular to the 2d carbon sheet for graphene ) , it is clear that not only the purcell factor is higher for 1d - swcnts than for 2d - graphene , but their spatial dependence is very different : whereas for graphene the purcell factor increases rapidly towards short separations due to the dominant role of non - radiative channels , for swcnts this increase is much less pronounced .",
    "as mentioned above , a high coupling efficiency between qes and propagating sps is the key ingredient to achieve many of the proposed functionalities within the field of waveguide qed . in figure 4 we show the @xmath1 factor as a function of the qe - swcnt distance for several values of the qe - frequency .",

    "our results imply that quenching phenomenon ( i.e. , when the qe emission is dominated by non - radiative decay channels ) only appears at very short distances ( @xmath68 nm ) for qes coupled to swcnts . as opposite to other metallic systems , swcnts present the crucial advantage of not requiring a spacer to avoid quenching of qes at small separations .",
    "we attribute this negligible contribution of quenching modes to the very small quantity of material that binds the em fields to the carbon nanotube . in contrast , in graphene a high coupling efficiency is only observed within a much narrower range of distances , and quenching shows up at distances below @xmath69 nm for the optimum wavelength , @xmath70 m ( see inset of fig .",

    "<S> we show that a single quantum emitter can efficiently couple to the tunable plasmons of a highly doped single - wall carbon nanotube ( swcnt ) . </S>",
    "<S> plasmons in these quasi - one - dimensional carbon structures exhibit deep subwavelength confinement that pushes the coupling efficiency close to @xmath0 over a very broad spectral range . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon takes place for distances and tube diameters comprising the nanometer and micrometer scales . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find a @xmath1 factor @xmath2 for qes placed @xmath3 nm away from swcnts that are just a few nanometers in diameter , while the corresponding purcell factor exceeds @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our finding not only holds great potential for waveguide qed , in which an efficient interaction between emitters and cavity modes is pivotal , but it also provides a way of realizing quantum strong coupling between several emitters mediated by swcnt plasmons , which can be controlled through the large electro - optical tunability of these excitations . </S>"
