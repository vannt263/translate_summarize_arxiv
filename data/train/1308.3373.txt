    "carrier propagation in mott or charge - transfer insulators is a challenging problem particularly motivated by strongly correlated superconducting cuprates @xcite .",
    "while holes move incoherently in one - dimensional systems featuring charge and spin separation @xcite as well as in systems with antiferromagnetic ( af ) ising interactions @xcite , the hole motion becomes coherent and quasiparticles ( qps ) arise at low energy in the quantum af @xmath0-@xmath1 model @xcite .",

    "we employ exact diagonalization ( ed ) of finite periodic clusters which has the important advantage that no approximations have to be made , which is particularly important as the analytical theory of hole - motion in the kh model is notoriously difficult and largely unexplored .",

    "we report the spectral functions of the different ordered phases and their respective quasiparticle features . moreover we report a totally incoherent spectral weight distribution for a hole moving in the kitaev spin - liquid phase in the strong coupling regime , i.e. , relevant for the iridate systems .",
    "the absence of qps in this case for finite systems clearly suggests that also in the tl there are no qps at strong coupling . for this reason",

    "[ fig : ksl](c ) has to be seen as a fingerprint of fractionalization of electrons into holons and gapless majorana fermions of the kitaev model @xcite . because of the dominant role of scattering from gapless spin - excitations we expect that in larger clusters with a denser @xmath139-mesh , hole pockets near the @xmath3 point are not protected against strong scattering , and in consequence the ksl does not turn into a fermi liquid at low doping .",
    ", as obtained for : ( a ) the zz phase and ( b ) the ksl phase , both at intermediate coupling @xmath198 , and ( c ) the ksl phase at strong coupling @xmath126 .",

    "width=302 ]    before moving to the strong coupling regime @xmath201 we shall highlight the striking difference of the spectral weight distribution @xmath202 at low energy in the zz and the ksl phase , respectively , at @xmath198 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : qp](a ) the spectral weight distribution @xmath202 for the zz phase shows well defined qp bound states .",
    "although the spectral weights of these qps are significantly reduced , the bound states are well separated from the continuum ( of incoherent states ) at higher energy , except for @xmath203 where this binding energy is much weaker . in the ksl phase fig . [",
    "fig : qp](b ) , on the other hand , a well defined bound state is seen only at the @xmath3 point . because of the size of the vortex gap @xmath204 the absence of qps in fig .",
    "[ fig : qp](b ) at @xmath119 , @xmath186 and @xmath122 is a smoking gun for the important role played by scattering by gapless majorana excitations .",
    "this is consistent with the spectral shape of @xmath205 which is reminiscent of a continuum , that may result from a convolution of holons and gapless majorana fermions .",
    "we turn now to the _ strong coupling _ regime . in the strong coupling case of @xmath115 ,",
    "i.e. , relevant for the iridates @xcite and displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : qp](c ) , the vortex spin gap becomes small ( in units of @xmath0 ) , i.e. , @xmath206 t .",
    "thus the strong coupling result in fig .",
    "[ fig : qp](c ) highlights the effect of the additional vortex excitations which form a new decay channel and damp the excitations at the @xmath122 , @xmath186 , and @xmath119 points even further .",
    "compared to the result at intermediate coupling at @xmath207 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : qp](b ) ] where the vortex gap is @xmath208 , at strong coupling one finds a spin gap to the vortex excitations which is 20 times smaller , that is @xmath209 .",
    "furthermore , it may be instructive to go back to the spectral function @xmath210 in fig . [",
    "fig : adw](d ) which basically contains the same information for the strong coupling case ( @xmath126 ) of the ksl as the spectral weight distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qp](c ) . the fine structure seen in @xmath202",
    "can only be resolved in @xmath210 when the resolution parameter @xmath174 is taken small enough . for arpes experiments , where actually @xmath211 is measured",
    ", this implies that a sufficient momentum and energy resolution is required .",
    "we conclude , that the peak at @xmath3 , which appeared as a separate bound state at intermediate coupling in fig .",
    "[ fig : qp](b ) , appears now at strong coupling , see fig .",
    "[ fig : qp](c ) , rather as the edge of the continuum than as an isolated bound state .",
    "moreover , when a single hole does not propagate as a qp , then a dilute gas of holes will not form a fermi liquid .",
    "therefore we stress , that the absence of a well defined separate bound state is a _ new _ qualitative feature which speaks against qps and fermi liquid behavior at low doping , and this time the argument emerges from a diagnosis at the @xmath3 point itself !",
    "we have shown that hole propagation is modified in a remarkable way as increasing kitaev interactions drive the system from the nel order via other ordered antiferromagnetic phases towards the kitaev spin liquid .",
    "quasiparticles are found in the nel phase , whereas coherent hole propagation is hindered in stripe and zigzag phases , where hidden quasiparticles with weak dispersion result from coexisting ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bonds . as the most unexpected result , in the kitaev liquid phase we have found unprecedented spectral weight distribution at low energy that signals the absence of quasiparticles , both at intermediate and strong coupling .",
    "thus , it appears clearly that carrier motion in the lightly doped kitaev liquid is non - fermi liquid like .",
    "the above conclusion follows from the short - range nature of spin correlations in the kitaev spin liquid @xcite . unlike in a quantum antiferromagnet on a square @xcite or honeycomb @xcite lattice",
    "where spin - flip processes couple to a moving hole and generate new energy scale for coherent hole propagation , the kitaev spin - liquid phase is characterized by ising - like nearest neighbor spin correlations of one spin component .",
    "such correlations are insufficient to generate coherent hole propagation .",
    "they are well captured by the present cluster size of @xmath32 sites , and qualitative changes of the described scenario are therefore unexpected when the cluster size is increased .    summarizing , we have given clear arguments that shed serious doubts on the claim from a slave - boson approximation , namely that the low doped kitaev spin - liquid phase is a fermi liquid @xcite .",
    "the first of these arguments rests on the exact solution for the spin excitations in the kitaev model in the intermediate coupling regime , and on our finding that _ gapless _ majorana excitations are responsible for the absence of qps away from the @xmath3 point . from the gaplessness",
    "we conclude that also states in the closer vicinity of @xmath3 are not protected .",
    "our second argument emerges in the strong coupling case from the result for the spectral distribution @xmath212 at the @xmath3 point itself , which in this case has no similarity to a qp but appears rather as the edge of a continuum .",
    "we consider this as evidence that at strong coupling there are no qps in the single hole case near the @xmath3 point , and from this finding we can safely conclude that fermi liquid behavior is absent in the low doping regime .",
