    "the signals from this behavior are one of the most direct probes of the degree of thermalization in heavy - ion collisions  see e.g. @xcite for a recent summary .",
    "a particularly important measurement is the azimuthal anisotropy with respect to the reaction plane for non - central nuclear collisions : for these collisions , the interaction region is asymmetric with different gradients of density depending on the azimuthal angle . in a hydrodynamical medium ,",
    "these gradients lead to different accelerations of the particles in the medium , so that the spatial anisotropy translates into momentum anisotropies .",

    "jet - like structures are being studied at rhic by means of two- and three - particle correlations .",
    "an important step forward is the first measurement of two particle azimuthal correlations at large transverse momentum , with negligible combinatorial background @xcite .",
    "these data support the picture of a very opaque medium with large energy losses , but with a broadening of the associated soft radiation hidden underneath the cut - off . lowering this transverse momentum cut - off",
    "the different collaborations find non - trivial angular structures @xcite in the form of a double - peak structure , in striking contrast with the typical gaussian - like shape in proton - proton or peripheral auau collisions .",
    "similar structures are found in large angle medium - induced radiation due to the lpm and sudakov suppression of collinear gluons with energy @xmath29 gev @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "most of the energy is lost by radiation with negligible deposition in the medium . on the opposite limit ,",
    "if a large fraction of the jet energy is deposited fast enough into a hydrodynamical medium it will be diffused by sound or dispersive modes .",
    "for very energetic particles , traveling faster than the speed of sound in the medium , a shock wave is produced with a characteristic angle which could also be at the origin of the measured structures @xcite .",
    "another interpretation of this effect is in terms of cherenkov radiation @xcite .",
    "very interesting effects appear in the intermediate region of @xmath30 gev / c .",
    "the most spectacular of them is the appearance of valence quark number scaling laws for baryons and mesons : ( i ) @xmath31 , the normalized ratio of high-@xmath21 yields in central to peripheral collisions , seems to depend only on the valence number of the produced particle ; ( ii ) the elliptic flow parameter @xmath7 is universal when plotted as @xmath32 , @xmath33 being the number of valence quarks .",
    "a successful model to describe these features is a two component soft+hard model , in which the soft spectrum is assumed to come from the recombination of quarks in a medium in thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the hard part of the spectrum is given by eq .",
    "( [ eqhard ] ) with a simplified treatment of the energy loss .    in @xcite",

    "although the analysis presented here is based on a given model implementation , the experimental facts on the quark counting rules indicate that the effect is more general and would survive more sophisticated implementations .",
    "these findings show that heavy - ion collisions are ideal tools to study the content of different resonances and to find a definitive answer to the structure of these exotic states .",
    "clearly such a measurements are , at the same time , excellent playgrounds for the study of the relevant degrees of freedom of the produced medium .",
    "heavy - ion collisions , together with spectroscopy , have been the two most active areas of discoveries in the strong interaction in the last years .",
    "both deal with the structure of extended objects for which first principle computations in qcd present some limitations . in these conditions",
    "a cross talk between theory and experiment is essential to make progress on the understanding of how macroscopic structures organize in qcd and what are their relevant building blocks .",
