    "recent progress with imaging air cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) is enabling the exploration of sites of cosmic - ray acceleration in our galaxy .",
    "very high energy ( vhe ) gamma rays are produced by the decay of neutral pions which arise from interactions between the accelerated protons and interstellar matter , or by inverse compton ( ic ) scattering and bremsstrahlung of high - energy electrons .",
    "for example , vhe gamma rays have been detected from young supernova remnants ( snrs ) such as rx j1713.7@xmath03946 @xcite , rx j0852.0@xmath04622 @xcite , and rcw86 @xcite , which show possible evidence of cosmic - ray acceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , detections of vhe gamma rays from pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) such as the crab nebula @xcite and vela x nebula @xcite have shown that pwne also play an important role in particle acceleration in the galaxy . recently ,",
    "vhe gamma - ray emission related to massive stars such as the x - ray binary systems psr  b1259@xmath063 @xcite and ls  i  + 61 303 @xcite , the young open stellar clusters cyg  ob2 @xcite , westerlund  2 @xcite , and westerlund  1 @xcite have also been reported .",
    "moreover , the galactic plane survey performed by the h.e.s.s .",
    "observatory @xcite discovered seventeen unidentified vhe gamma - ray sources , including hess  j1614@xmath0518 .",
    "today , unidentified sources are the largest class of the 123 discovered vhe gamma - ray sources , most of which are located in the galactic plane ( e.g. , ; the tevcat catalog , @xcite , is a useful up - to - date , on - line resource ) . in general , the lack of non - thermal electromagnetic radiation from the radio to the x - ray bands may be evidence of hadron acceleration because the ic scenario requires a lower magnetic field than the typical interstellar magnetic field intensity of a few @xmath8 g .",
    "revealing the possible radiation mechanism(s ) of each unidentified source is therefore important for identifying the origin(s ) of cosmic rays .",
    "h.e.s.s .  reported that hess  j1614@xmath0518 had a high flux level , 25% of the crab nebula , above 200gev with a photon index of 2.4 and an elliptical morphology with a semi - major axis of @xmath9  arcmin and a semi - minor axis of @xmath10  arcmin @xcite .",
    "the peak position has an offset of 8.7  arcmin to the north - east from the central position .",
    "@xcite and @xcite pointed out that hess j1614@xmath0518 may be associated with the 40  myr - old young open star cluster pismis  22 @xcite which is located within the vhe gamma - ray emission region at a distance of 1.0@xmath110.4kpc and has sufficient luminosity to produce the observed gamma - ray luminosity , assuming 20% energy conversion from the stellar winds of ten b - type stars .",
    "however , there are several issues in identifying hess  j1614@xmath0518 with pismis  22 since the size of pismis  22 , 2.0arcmin in diameter , is one order of magnitude smaller than the vhe gamma - ray emission size and the location has a 12arcmin offset from the vhe gamma - ray emission peak . in addition , there has been no detailed discussion of the radiation mechanism .",
    "the x - ray satellite _ suzaku _ observed this region with the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) and found three x - ray sources in their follow - up observation in 2006 @xcite .",
    "one of these , called suzaku source  a , is located very close to the vhe gamma - ray peak position with an offset of 0.8arcmin .",
    "the spectrum is well fitted by a single power - law model with a photon index of @xmath12 and a hydrogen equivalent column density of @xmath13 @xmath4 .",
    "the distance to suzaku source  a is approximately 10  kpc , which was derived from the hydrogen equivalent column density using the total galactic hi column density toward hess  j1614@xmath0518 of @xmath14  @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the size of the x - ray emission region is slightly larger than the _ suzaku _ point spread function ( psf ) of 1.8arcmin and smaller than the size of the vhe gamma - ray region .",
    "this difference is seen in pwne such as hess  j1825@xmath0137 @xcite and vela x @xcite and could be explained by the difference between the synchrotron cooling time of the electrons that radiate x - rays and those that produce tev gamma rays .",
    "electrons with an energy of 100tev radiate x - rays and immediately lose their energy by synchrotron cooling ( e.g. , the energy - loss timescale is @xmath15  yr assuming a magnetic field of 20  @xmath8 g @xcite ) , while electrons with an energy of 1tev , which are responsible for the vhe gamma ray emission through ic scattering , are more slowly cooled by synchrotron radiation ( e.g. , the energy - loss timescale is @xmath16  yr assuming the same parameters as above ) and can travel further from their source .",
    "however , the ratio between the observed vhe gamma - ray and x - ray fluxes , f(110 tev ) / f(210 kev ) of @xmath1734 , is much larger than those of known pwne  @xmath18 , 0.7 , and 1.5 for the crab , msh  15 - 52 , and vela x , respectively @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , recent studies of hess  j1640@xmath0465 @xcite and hess  j1804@xmath0216 @xcite claim that this large ratio can be explained by a time - evolving electron injection model , in which the number of electrons injected into space by the pulsar decreases proportionally to the spin - down of the pulsar . on the other hand , this large ratio is also expected in an old snr with an age of @xmath19  yr , because of the difference between the cooling times of electrons and protons @xcite .",
    "we therefore discuss both a pwn scenario and an snr scenario in this paper .",
    "suzaku source  b is positioned towards the center of hess  j1614@xmath0518 and is coincident with the position of pismis  22 .",
    "since the hydrogen equivalent column density derived from the suzaku spectrum is @xmath20 @xmath4 , which is comparable with that of suzaku source  a , suzaku source  b may lie at a similar distance as for suzaku source a. this source has a non - thermal x - ray emission with a photon index of @xmath21 . this soft index and x - ray luminosities of @xmath22  ergs",
    "s@xmath5 and @xmath23  ergs  s@xmath5 in the 2@xmath010  kev and 0.5@xmath010  kev ranges , respectively , assuming a distance of 10  kpc , are typical values for an anomalous x - ray pulsar ( axp ) @xcite .",
    "the possible existence of the axp also suggests this source as an snr , since axps are usually associated with snrs , e.g. , 1e  2259 + 586 with ctb  109 @xcite and 1e  1841@xmath0045 with kes  73 @xcite .",
    "since the position of this source is coincident with pismis  22 , there is a possibility that this emission originates from the stellar winds from the stellar cluster .",
    "non - thermal x - ray emission from a stellar cluster was reported from westerlund  1 @xcite , and tev gamma rays were recently detected from this object @xcite .",
    "however , this positional correlation may be only a chance coincidence since the estimated distances to suzaku source  b and pismis  22 are different by an order of magnitude .",
    "although suzaku source  b might be marginally extended , it is difficult to quantitatively estimate the spatial extension with the suzaku psf of 1.8  arcmin .",
    "if suzaku source b is actually extended , additional scenarios besides an snr could be considered , e.g. , a pwn from a pulsar / axp as discussed in @xcite , or emission from the unresolved hot stars in pismis 22 .",
    "the other source , suzaku source  c , is a late b - type star as described in @xcite , and thus is not a possible counterpart of hess j1614@xmath0518 .    _",
    "swift _ observed this region with the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) and found six x - ray sources ( hereafter swift sources  1 to 6 ) @xcite .",
    "all these sources were point - like and no diffuse emission was found .",
    "two sources , swift sources  1 and 4 , are located within the field of view ( fov ) of the _ suzaku _ observation .",
    "swift source  1 is located close to pismis  22 with an offset of 42  arcsec .",
    "this source is also coincident with suzaku source  b. swift source  4 is coincident with suzaku source  c. swift sources  1 , 2 , 3 , 5 are probably stars , while the nature of swift sources  4 and 6 were not identified , probably due to the poor statistics . although suzaku source  a was located in the fov of the _ swift _ xrt , it was not detected with _",

    "cangaroo - iii is an array of four iacts ( t1 , t2 , t3 , and t4 ) , located at woomera , south australia ( 136@xmath2547e , 31@xmath2506s , 160 m a.s.l . ) @xcite .",
    "the oldest telescope , t1 , which was the cangaroo - ii telescope , has not been in use since 2004 due to its smaller fov and higher energy threshold .",

    "the coincidence between a young open cluster and a vhe gamma - ray source is also seen in westerlund  2 and cyg ob2 as described in section  1 .",
    "stellar winds from massive stars could form a shock front , accelerate charged particles , and produce the high energy radiation @xcite .",
    "another possibility is an association between an snr , pwn and the open cluster , since pismis  22 is old enough for some massive stars to finish their life as supernovae .",
    "in addition , as described in section  1 , binary systems that emit vhe gamma rays also have been discovered .",
    "however , hess  j1614@xmath0518 does not seem to be associated with a binary system , since all sources of this type have point - like emission , which is in contrast to the results of cangaroo - iii and h.e.s.s .",
    "we discuss the above scenarios in detail in the following subsections .          in the snr scenario",

    "we also calculated the contribution of emissions from secondary electrons from _ p - p _ interactions between the same proton population as above and the ambient matter density of 100@xmath85@xmath61 .",
    "we followed the calculation in @xcite to derive the spectrum of the secondary electrons . assuming a distance of 10kpc from the earth , the distance between suzaku source  a and source  b was calculated to be 35  pc .",
    "thus , we assumed that the radius of the snr is 35  pc and roughly estimated the age of the snr using the equation  ( 2 ) in @xcite to be @xmath86  yr .",
    "thus , the emissions from the secondary electrons were derived by assuming continuous injection of electrons produced by a constant proton spectrum over @xmath86  yr with a magnetic field of 200  @xmath8 g @xcite .",
    "the obtained synchrotron curve is also shown in figure  [ fig : hadron ] .",
    "the obtained inverse compton and bremsstrahlung emissions were able to be neglected since the number of electrons is sufficiently small .",
    "since the synchrotron emission from the secondary electrons was not able to explain the x - ray emission , the x - ray emission might originate in the synchrotron emission from the primary electrons , as shown in figure  [ fig : hadron ] , or other emission mechanisms .",
    "since the synchrotron emission from the secondary electrons dominates below the infrared band , the detection of the emission in the radio to infrared bands could support the hypothesis that the vhe gamma - ray emission is produced by the neutral - pion decay .",
    "because the _ spitzer _ upper limit was above the predicted flux of synchrotron emission , more detailed observations are needed .    to discuss the possible association between the snr and pismis  22 , we estimated the snr age using the distance to pismis  22 with the assumption that a supernova explosion occurred at the position of pismis  22 and the shock front has now reached at the vhe gamma - ray peak position . by using the same equation ( 2 ) in @xcite ,",
    "the age was obtained to be @xmath87  yr for a distance of 1  kpc . since the lower limit of a magnetic field was obtained to be @xmath83200  @xmath8 g as above",
    ", the synchrotron cooling time of 100  tev electrons decreased to 1  yr . for a distance of 1  kpc ,",
    "the required total energy of protons @xmath88 could be reduced if the number density of ambient matter @xmath89 is the same as for a distance of 10  kpc .",
    "if the total energy of protons @xmath88 is fixed to be 10@xmath90 ergs , the required density of ambient matter is reduced to @xmath91  @xmath61 for a distance of 1  kpc .",
    "this value was comparable with the typical number density in the interstellar field and does not contradict the fact that no obvious molecular cloud was found in the nanten @xmath65co(j=1 - 0 ) survey data .",
    "the contribution of emissions from secondary electrons was shown in figure  [ fig : hadron ] , assuming the injection time of @xmath92  yr with a magnetic field of 200  @xmath8 g .",
    "the synchrotron emission from the secondary electrons was not able to explain the x - ray spectrum of suzaku source a. the x - ray emission might originate in the synchrotron emission from the primary electrons , or other emission mechanisms . since the flux of synchrotron emission from the secondary electrons in the radio to infrared bands was lower than that of the case of a distance of 10  kpc , as shown in figure  [ fig : hadron ] , a determination of the spectrum below the infrared band is a key to reveal the origin of the snr . additionally , an observation of thin thermal plasma in the x - ray band will provide useful information such as plasma temperature or chemical abundances .",
    "for example , the detection of high abundance of @xmath93-elements ( o , mg , si , s , ca , and ti ) compared to that of iron , which is expected in a massive star explosion @xcite , may support the snr scenario .",
    "in fact , a recent _ suzaku _ observation of the open cluster westerlund  2 detected metal - rich thermal emission , suggesting that the diffuse x - ray and vhe gamma - ray emission may have originated from a hypernova remnant @xcite .",
    "the dash - dotted and solid blue lines show ic and synchrotron emission derived from the single power - law electron spectrum with an exponential cutoff to fit the vhe emission with a magnetic field of 6  @xmath8 g .",
    "the dashed black line shows a bremsstrahlung curve for a number density of ambient matter of @xmath94 . ]",
    "the vhe gamma - ray emission might have been produced by hadrons accelerated in winds from massive stars in pismis  22  @xcite .",
    "a fraction of the stellar wind energy can be transferred to relativistic particles .",
    "assuming that the shock acceleration generates a single power - law spectrum of primary particles , we can apply the discussion made in the snr scenario .",
    "we discuss the energetics for the hadronic origin here to produce the observed gamma - ray emission .",
    "a single o - type star loses mass at a rate of @xmath95 per year with a stellar wind velocity of @xmath96  km  s@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the rate of kinetic energy emitted from the single star is @xmath97 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "if we assume an energy conversion efficiency to particle acceleration of 5  % , which is the maximum efficiency adopted for a hadronic model in @xcite , an ambient matter density of @xmath98  @xmath61 , a distance of 1kpc , and an age of 40myr , two o - type stars are required in pismis  22 to produce the observed vhe gamma - ray spectrum in the hadronic scenario .",
    "however , no obvious molecular cloud has been found at this distance in the nanten data , as described above .",
    "pwne are the largest class of identified galactic vhe gamma - ray sources .",
    "we discuss the possibility of hess  j1614@xmath0518 being a pwn in this subsection .    as calculated in @xcite , the spin - down luminosity of each of the five nearby pulsars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : map3 ] ) is smaller than the tev gamma - ray luminosity .",
    "thus , none of already known pulsars can be associated with hess  j1614@xmath0518 .",
    "there is also the possibility that an undiscovered pulsar with a high spin - down power , sufficient to explain the observed gamma - ray luminosity , might be located in the vicinity of suzaku source  a or source  b. we estimated the pulsar age to be 24  kyr and 23  kyr for suzaku source a and b , respectively , using the correlation between pulsar age and the ratio of gamma - ray flux and x - ray flux from the pwn @xcite . for this relatively old age",
    ", we should apply the time - evolving electron injection model ( section  1 ) .",
    "we applied this model to hess  j1614@xmath0518 , following the calculation in @xcite applied to hess  j1804 - 216 .",
    "although this model can explain the large ratio between the x - ray and tev gamma - ray fluxes assuming a single power - law electron distribution , the model showed a very large discrepancy with the sub - gev flux observed with _ fermi _ , the model curve is 30 times larger than the observed flux at 0.1  gev .",
    "thus , the time - evolving electron injection model with a single power - law electron distribution was rejected .",
    "the mev / gev component could arise from the different mechanism than the tev emission .",
    "although the present sensitivity in the radio band may not be sufficient to detect this unknown pulsar , further observations in the gev band could detect a radio quiet pulsar like geminga , which was detected with _",
    "egret @xcite , or sixteen previously unknown pulsars which were recently discovered with _",
    "fermi _ @xcite .",
    "in addition , future x - ray observations could detect pulsed emission from suzaku source  a or source  b. given these detections , emission models for pwns ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , using a broken power - law distribution of electrons , might be able to reveal that the vhe gamma - ray emission of this unidentified source originates from a pwn .",
    "the observation of hess j1614@xmath0518 with the cangaroo - iii telescopes confirms the vhe gamma - ray emission reported by h.e.s.s .",
    "the differential energy spectrum can be fitted with a single power law:@xmath99tev@xmath3 @xmath4s@xmath5tev@xmath5 with a photon index @xmath6 of @xmath7 .",
    "we discuss the possible counterparts for this object using the results of observations with _",
    "suzaku _ and _",
    "fermi_. for the snr scenario , a one - zone leptonic model was not able to account for the observed sed .",
    "hadronic models gave a good reproduction of the sed and the typical snr explosion energy of @xmath77ergs is able to supply the total energy of protons . since the required number densities of the ambient matter were @xmath91  @xmath61 and @xmath76  @xmath61 for a distance to the snr of 1  kpc and 10  kpc , respectively , detailed molecular observations could determine whether the snr originated from pismis  22 ( d@xmath171  kpc ) or a farther distance .",
    "as there were also differences in the spectrum of the emission from the secondary electrons , a determination of the spectrum below the infrared band would help determine the likelihood of an snr origin .",
    "for the pwn scenario , the nearby known pulsars are not responsible since the spin - down powers are insufficient to produce the observed tev gamma - ray luminosity .",
    "further observations to search a pulsar are necessary to investigate the pwn scenario .",
    "for the stellar wind scenario , pismis  22 was required to contain two o - type stars through its entire age from energetics considerations",
    ". however , the required number density of the ambient matter of @xmath76  @xmath61 may not be consistent with the results of the nanten observations .",
    "to identify hess  j1614@xmath0518 , more detailed multiwavelength observations are required . to discuss the stellar wind origin in more detail",
    ", a determination of the number of ob stars is necessary . for the snr scenario ,",
    "the ultra - high energy resolution of the sxs onboard _ astro - h _ could detect line emissions with a high abundance of @xmath93-elements compared to that of iron , which would indicate that hess  j1614@xmath0518 is an snr . to show that the suzaku source  b is an axp , supporting the snr or pwn scenario , a high time - resolution x - ray observation",
    "is needed to detect a pulsed signal from the source .",
    "more detailed gamma - ray spectroscopy with _ fermi _ , and the cherenkov telescope array @xcite could determine the origin of the accelerated particles .",
