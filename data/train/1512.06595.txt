    "even after the discovery of the higgs scalar with @xmath18 mass @xcite , mechanisms to maintain the hierarchy between the electroweak scale and planck scale is still unknown . warped extra dimension is one of the way to explain such a large hierarchy between the electroweak scale and planck scale @xcite . in this scenario",
    ", such hierarchy is obtained from the exponentially large warp factor of the metric of the space . in this direction , the standard model in the warped space",
    "is considered in @xcite .",
    "such models , however , suffer from large deviation of oblique @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameters @xcite . to suppress the @xmath2 parameter models",
    "are extended so as to possess the custodial symmetry@xcite . to suppress the @xmath1 parameter , brane - localized kinetic terms @xcite and the soft - wall warped extra dimension",

    "although some excesses with invariant masses around or below @xmath20 in di - boson channels have been reported @xcite , experimental results in the lhc run-1 @xcite and first - year results of lhc run-2 @xcite seem to exclude the @xmath7 and @xmath21 bosons which are lighter than @xmath19 in fermionic decay channels .",
    "therefore in this paper we focus on warped extra dimensional scenarios in which kk particles are heavier than @xmath19 .    in this paper",
    "we reconsider the higgsless model in warped extra dimension @xcite . in the higgsless model",
    "the electroweak symmetry breaking is caused by the boundary conditions on the tev brane , and this model also yields large value of @xmath1 parameter@xcite , and experimentally excluded by the discovery of the higgs boson . in order to suppress the @xmath1 parameter , some dirichlet boundary conditions on the brane are replaced with generalized robin boundary conditions .",
    "a mass parameter @xmath0 is introduced to parameterize the robin boundary conditions . in the @xmath22",
    "limit the model reduces to the original model , whereas @xmath23 reproduce the unbroken electroweak symmetry . as @xmath0 decreases from @xmath24 to zero , we obtain smaller magnitudes of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 parameters while the kaluza - klein scale becomes larger .",
    "in this paper we also study the mass structure of weak bosons in detail .",
    "the robin boundary conditions can be induced by the mass terms localized on branes @xcite . in the original model where @xmath22",
    ", the mass of weak bosons are coming from their momenta along the extra spacial dimension .",
    "as @xmath0 decreases , contributions from the brane mass terms dominates in the weak boson masses .",
    "such a brane mass can also be identified with the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a scalar field , namely the higgs boson observed in the lhc .",
    "based on such identification we also estimate the higgs couplings to the weak bosons in this model .    this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ] , an extension of the higgsless model in warped space",
