    "angiogenesis , the growth of new blood vessel from pre - existing vasculature , is crucial to many physiological and pathological processes , such as embryonic development , tumor growth , and wound healing .",
    "typically these new vessels are very thin ( thus also called capillaries ) and are lined up by an array of tightly adhered endothelial cells .",
    "endothelial cells migrate up the gradient of chemotactic cues such as vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) released by tumor cells . along a capillary",
    ", the tip cell generates a protrusion force to drag the whole capillary forward , and at the same time , stalk cells after the tip proliferate and generate new masses to sustain the capillary extension . during the capillary extension ,",
    "endothelial cells have to overcome the adhesion ( or friction ) with surroundings , such as other types of cells and extracellular matrix .",
    "a detailed description of angiogenesis biology can be found in @xcite .",
    "traditional mathematical models on the capillary extension focus on the chemotactic migration of endothelial cells which is typically modeled as a reaction - convection - diffusion equation ( see reviews in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "such models lack the investigation of relationships between the growth of endothelial cells , mechanical extension of the capillary , and interactions between the capillary and surroundings .",
    "these topics are central not only to angiogenesis but also to the biological growth of all soft tissues . however ,  the mathematical modeling of biological growth is currently in an adolescent stage \" ( @xcite ) , because many constitutive relations are still unknown . therefore , it is a big challenge to model the relationships mentioned above .    among efforts to meet this challenge are one - dimensional models of epithelial cell monolayers migration ( @xcite,@xcite ) in wound healing , and a one - dimensional viscoelastic angiogenesis model proposed in @xcite .",
    "common features of these models include : ( i ) the blood vessel capillary or epithelial cell mono - layer is regarded as viscoelastic material connected by tight cell - cell junctions ; ( ii ) the cell growth is treated as an isotropic pressure ; ( iii ) the nonlinear friction exists between cells and surroundings . in this paper",
    ", we will first analyze the angiogenesis model in @xcite , and then utilize a numerical scheme to find approximate solutions to this nonlinear problem .",
    "assume , initially , a blood vessel capillary occupies the entire interval @xmath0 $ ] , and every point of the capillary is denoted by the lagrangian coordinate , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the root which is fixed in space , and @xmath3 represents the tip which is free to move . the deformation of the point @xmath1 at time @xmath4 is denoted as @xmath5 .",

    "note that @xmath15 is the deformation rate of endothelial cells in the capillary .",
    "the equation has the absolute sign of @xmath15 , so it may admit solutions of negative deformation rate .",
    "however , a negative deformation rate in one - dimensional space is not biological : it means one cell simply passes through another cell .",

    "the key technique to prove theorem 2.1 is to find some nontrivial transformations to simplify the problem for which the maximum principle can be applied .",
    "because of the nonlinearity , it is hard to find the explicit solutions .",

[",
    "a ] [ b ]    these comparisons confirm the suggestion at the beginning of this section , that is , when we focus on the biological values , it is valid to neglect the viscosity .      in all the examples of this subsection , we let @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath136 .    first , we choose @xmath137 .",
    "this choice satisfies the conditions in theorem [ thmexistence ] ( a ) .",

    "a few time steps later the numerical solution blows up near @xmath2 .",
    "notice in the mathematical model the density serves as a pressure exerting in the direction @xmath148 , that is , from high pressure regions to low pressure regions .",
    "the breakdown of the second example stems from the high density at the tip driving towards the root . at the root ,",
    "the boundary condition @xmath149 makes the root cell nowhere to escape .",
    "so even after it is smashed to zero length , the pressure still can not be balanced , which results in the breakdown of the model .",

    "releases the pressure and avoid the breakdown of the system .",

    "note that the pressure gradient in the blow - up case is even smaller than that in the non - blow - up case , therefore , the blow - up in the second example can not be attributed to the high pressure gradient . however , the pressure amplitude in the blow - up case is larger than the non - blow - up case . therefore , it is pressure s amplitude that breaks down the system .",
    "in this section , we apply the mathematical model to simulate angiogenesis under three real biological conditions : capillary extension without proliferation , extension with proliferation , and capillary regression .      in the experiments of @xcite , the endothelial cells are given x - ray irradiation .",
    "with enough doses of irradiation , dna synthesis are stalled and cells lose the ability to proliferate .",
    "this means the cell density will keep the same from the beginning .",
    "therefore , the cell density is always equal to the reference density , that is , @xmath157 for all the points and all the time ( see appendix for non - dimensionalization ) . the viscosity and protrusion force",
    "are chosen as @xmath158 and @xmath159 , within the biological ranges as discussed in the appendix .",
    "however , the friction is a variable in time . because , at the initial stage of angiogenesis , endothelial cells have to overcome the tight association with surrounding cells and basement membrane.these obstacles are rapidly reduced after the initial stage , so the friction is smaller with the progression of angiogenesis .",
    "therefore , we assume the friction is a time - dependent function @xmath160 whose graph is plotted in fig.[fig1][a ] .",
    "this is a pretty rough approximation of the true variation of the friction .",
    "indeed the friction depend on many other conditions , such as the proteins regulating ec - environment adhesion , association with pericytes , etc .",
    "readers are referred to @xcite for more details .",
    "the numerical solutions are shown in fig.[fig1][b ] . at time @xmath138",
    ", only the points near the tip have observable motion , because the friction is very large initially and only the cells near the tip can be dragged with remarkable distance by the protrusion force exerted at the tip . up to @xmath161 ,",
    "all points migrate toward the tip direction .",
    "the deformation of the tip is @xmath162 at @xmath163 and @xmath164 at @xmath134 .",
    "these correspond to the whole capillary length @xmath165 at day 4 and @xmath166 at day 7 after the initiation of angiogenesis , very close to the rat corneal experimental results in @xcite .",
    "[ a ] [ b ]    although there is no cell proliferation , the protrusion force of the tip cell drags the capillary to extend .",
    "the ultimate deformation is limited by the elasticity and is given by the steady state solution @xmath167 . for the above example",
    ", this value is @xmath164 , which has been achieved by the numerical simulation .",
    "however , the lack of proliferation does affect the capillary extension : the capillary only reaches @xmath166 , but the distance from the root to the chemotactic source is about @xmath168 in the experiments of @xcite .",
    "the limited capillary extension without proliferation is an important feature of biological growth , but it is very hard to capture using reaction - diffusion - convection models .",
    "for example , many reaction - convection - diffusion models ( e.g. @xcite ) only tracks the motion of the tip cell , which is modeled as migrating towards the chemotactic source without any restriction of trailing cells .",
    "thus , it falsely predicts the capillary reaches the chemotactic source even when there is no cell proliferation .      comparing with the last example , we change the cell density to @xmath169 .",
    "the biological meaning of this function is that the cells uniformly proliferate in the whole capillary : each cell generates two more cells per day .",
    "the numerical results are shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the value of @xmath17 of the capillary tip is equal to @xmath170 at @xmath138 , @xmath171 at @xmath163 , and @xmath172 at @xmath134 .",
    "these represents the capillary reaches @xmath173 at day 1 , @xmath174 at day 4 , and @xmath175 at day 7 .",
    "these results reproduce the data in the experiments of @xcite and at day 7 the capillary has already reached the chemotactic source .    in this example",
    ", both the tip cell protrusion and stalk cell proliferation contribute to the capillary extension .",
    "comparing with the last example , cell proliferation is more decisive in supporting the extension of the capillary until it reaches the chemotactic source .",
    "mathematically , the increase of cell density alters the balance between the previous stress and density .",
    "the cells enlarge the deformation to adjust to the higher density , which allows the extension of the vessel .",
    "therefore , the tip cell migration plays a leading role in capillary extension while stalk cell proliferation provides necessary material to support the extension .",
    "the newly formed blood vessels in pathological corneal angiogenesis can be treated by the drug bevacizumab as in @xcite to induce apoptosis of endothelial cells , thus the regression of blood vessels . to simulate this therapy",
    ", we reset the friction as a constant @xmath18 , and the cell density as @xmath176 ( see fig[fig3][a ] ) , which represents the cells begin to die from the tip to the root .",
    "because the tip cell is dying , it loses the ability to produce the protrusion force .",
    "therefore , @xmath136 .",
    "the numerical results in fig.[fig3][b ] show that the deformation of the capillary tip is @xmath177 at @xmath133 , which means the capillary shrinks by @xmath178 after 5 days regression , so only @xmath179 is left .",
    "the deformation gradient @xmath140 at @xmath133 is zero for @xmath180 $ ] , indicating the cells initially in this interval have died out .",
    "this simulation basically captures the experiments observed in human corneal angiogenesis treatment results in @xcite .",
    "[ a ] [ b ]    contrary to the last example , the cell density decreases with respect to time in capillary regression . in this model ,",
    "the stress / stain is supported by the density .",
    "therefore , the loss of density induces the decrease of stain , thus the regression .",
    "this phenomenon is almost impossible to be modeled by reaction - convection - diffusion models because they lack the mechanisms to retract the capillary .",
    "for example , in the model of @xcite where only the tip cell is modeled , the tip cell would stay where it used to be in space once the chemotactic cues are removed by therapy , thus regression observed in experiments would not occur .",
    "this article analyzes a one - dimensional blood vessel growth model with both analytical and numerical tools , and demonstrates its power in simulating various biological growth cases .",
    "theorem[thmexistence ] concludes that the global biological solution exist if ( a ) the cell mass density is a decreasing function along the capillary from the root to the tip , or ( b ) the amplitude of the cell density along the capillary is less than the unity .",
    "the system may break down if these two conditions are violated .",
    "indeed numerical examples indicate that if there is a big pressure drop from the tip to the root direction or a big oscillating amplitude of density , then the solution would probably blow up at the low density point .",
    "the underlying mechanism of breakdown is the failure of linear elasticity to resist the high pressure impact .    besides modeling the biological growth",
    ", this current model can also be used to describe the slow deformation of one - dimensional thermoelastic bar , where the stress tensor is the same as except the cell density is interpreted by temperature ( _ cf._@xcite ) . therefore the analysis can be applied in the thermoelastic case .",
    "for example , if the temperature decreases from the root to the tip of the bar , or has small oscillations along it , then the global solution exists . however , if the tip of the bar is overheated or a large temperature oscillation is applied on the bar , then the bar may be broken by the expansion pressure produced by temperature differentials .",
    "the reaction - convection - diffusion models are predominant in continuous models of angiogenesis , but they encounter great difficulties in simulating capillary growth without proliferation and capillary regression .",
    "the difficulties come from the fact that they are unable to build connections between tip cell protrusion , change of stalk cell density , alteration of the stress , and capillary extension .",
    "in contrast , the model of @xcite regards the whole capillary as one viscoelastic material dragged by the tip cell and directly relates cell density with elastic deformation .",
    "plus the nonlinear interactions with surroundings , this model is capable of simulating various capillary growth patterns .",
    "the blood vessel capillary extension is described in the reference coordinate @xmath181 $ ] by @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the initial capillary length , @xmath5 is the displacement of material point @xmath1 at time @xmath4 , @xmath184 is the friction , @xmath185 is the capillary radius , @xmath186 is the young s modulus of endothelial cells , @xmath187 is the dynamic viscosity , @xmath188 is the initial cell density , @xmath189 is the cell density multiplied with @xmath190 , and @xmath191 is the protrusion force at the tip of the capillary . for the derivation of this model and other related models , see @xcite .",
    "choose @xmath183 as the characteristic length , which is @xmath192 based on the experiments in @xcite . because angiogenesis typically runs a couple of days from the initiation to the penetration of tumor / tissue , we choose @xmath193 as the characteristic time scale .",
    "let @xmath194 , and insert these relations to the above system , where we then delete the primes for simplicity .",
    "therefore we obtain for @xmath195 $ ] , @xmath196 where @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 , and @xmath200 .",
    "the young s modulus @xmath186 for endothelial cells is between @xmath201 according to @xcite .",
    "the viscosity @xmath202 is not available for endothelial cells , so we replace it with the value for fibroblasts @xcite : @xmath128 ( comparing with @xmath203 of water , @xmath204 of tar , and @xmath205 of pitch , all at @xmath131 @xcite ) .",
    "the estimate of @xmath206 will be highly dependent on the cell - environment contacts .",
    "for example , in the case of bovine aortic endothelial cells ( baecs ) spreading on polyacrylamide gels , the friction is deduced to be @xmath207 @xcite . however , ecs experience much stronger friction or resistance in the _ in vivo _ condition , because ecs are in association with surrounding cells such as pericytes .",
    "therefore , we choose a large range for the friciton : @xmath208 .",
    "the radius of blood vessel capillary is about @xmath179 .",
    "the protrusion force @xmath191 is about @xmath209 as measured in @xcite . with these values ,",
    "the non - dimensionalized parameters become @xmath158 , @xmath210 $ ] , and @xmath211 $ ] .    both the viscosity and friction resist the motion of capillary , and their relationship can be analyzed from a model problem .",
    "assume the deformation @xmath5 is a periodic function in the free space with period @xmath212 , satisfying @xmath213 , and @xmath214 express @xmath5 in the fourier series @xmath215 , and insert it to .",
    "then we obtain @xmath216 for each mode number @xmath217 . the time scale for each mode to reach the steady state is @xmath218 .",
    "therefore , the time scale for the whole system is @xmath219 .",
    "given the above values of @xmath10 and @xmath7 , the viscosity is far less than the friction .",
    "this implies the viscosity would have negligible effects compared with the friction on the capillary extension .",
