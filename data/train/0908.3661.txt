    "the @xmath11 and the @xmath12 are taken over the set of stopping times no bigger than @xmath13 , with respect to the usual filtration generated by the process @xmath1 .",
    "our goal is to prove ( under some additional assumptions ) that if a sequence of stochastic processes @xmath14 , @xmath15 converges in law to @xmath1 then @xmath16 .",
    "although several papers dealt with stability of optimal stopping values under weak convergence of the underlying processes ( see @xcite and @xcite ) stability of dynkin s games values under weak convergence of the underlying processes was not studied before . in his unpublished paper",
    "@xcite aldous represented the notion of extended weak convergence and proved the stability of optimal stopping values under extended weak convergence of the underlying processes . in this paper",
    "we extend these results for dynkin s games .",
    "the main tools that we use for proving the result is the skorohod representation theorem ( see @xcite ) and the theory of extended weak convergence that aldous developed in @xcite .    in @xcite and",
    "@xcite the authors studied binomial approximations of american put options in the black  scholes ( bs ) model . in both of these papers",
    "it was proved by using different methods , that the option price in the bs model is a limit of option prices for an appropriate sequence of cox ",
    "ross  rubinstein ( crr ) models .",
    "furthermore they proved stability of the critical prices and the optimal stopping times . in @xcite",
    "the authors studied stability of optimal stopping values and optimal stopping times under convergence in probability of the underlying processes ( though , it seems that the part related to convergence of optimal stopping values contains some gaps ) .",
    "the most general result was obtained in @xcite where the authors considered a general framework and proved snell envelopes stability under weak convergence of the underlying processes .",
    "the authors used the fact that the snell envelope of a positive process is a positive supermartingale , and so it is a quasi martingale and the corresponding tightness theorems ( see @xcite ) can be employed . for dynkin",
    "s games the value process should not , in general , be a quasi martingale and so the above method is not applicable here , and so dynkin s games value process stability under weak convergence remains an open question , but we are able to prove in this paper the stability of dynkin s game values under the weak convergence of the underlying processes .",
    "one of the motivations to study dynkin s games values stability under weak convergence of the underlying processes is applications to game options approximations .",
    "recall , that a game contingent claim ( gcc ) or a game option was defined in @xcite as a contract between the seller and the buyer of the option such that both have the right to exercise it any time up to a maturity date ( horizon ) @xmath13 .",
    "if the buyer exercises the contract at time @xmath17 then he gets the payment @xmath18 , but if the seller cancels before the buyer then the latter gets the payment @xmath19 .",
    "the difference @xmath20 is the penalty which the seller pays to the buyer for the contract cancellation .",
    "thus the process @xmath1 can be considered as a discounted risky asset , and the processes @xmath21 are considered as the discounted payoff processes .",
    "in @xcite it was proved that pricing a gcc in a complete market leads to the value of a dynkin game with the payoffs @xmath22 under the unique martingale measure , namely if the process @xmath1 is a martingale then @xmath23 is the option price of the above game option .",
    "in @xcite it was proved that for a general incomplete market , if the process @xmath1 is a martingale then @xmath23 is an arbitrage - free price .",
    "convergence results for dynkin s games will allow us to approximate options prices in continuous time markets by a sequence of game options prices in discrete time markets which are defined on a discrete probability space .",
    "in addition to the theoretical interest such results have a practical value for calculations of options prices , since it is well known ( see @xcite ) that for a discrete probability space dynkin s games values can be calculated by dynamical programming algorithm . in this paper",
    "we give an example for approximations of game options with russian ( path dependent ) type of payoffs in the merton model .",
    "several papers ( see @xcite ) dealt with approximations of option prices for game options .",
    "these papers used strong approximation theorems in order to obtain error estimates for discrete time approximations of game options in the bs model with lipschitz conditions on the payoffs .",
    "the weak convergence approach does not allow one to obtain estimates of the error , but it works under weaker assumptions on the payoffs and can be applied for jump diffusion models .",
    "the main results of this paper are formulated in the next section where we also introduce the notation that will be used . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we derive auxiliary lemmas that we use . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we complete the proof of the main results of the paper . in section [ sec5 ]",
