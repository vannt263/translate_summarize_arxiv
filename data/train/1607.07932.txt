    "local lorentz invariance ( lli ) is an important foundation of modern physics and has been a subject of many stringent experimental and observational tests.@xcite however , a number of theories unifying gravity with the standard model of particle physics suggest possible violation of lorentz symmetry . while the suggested lli - violation energy scale is much larger than the energy currently attainable by particle accelerators , it might be accessible with precision measurements at low energy .",
    "therefore , high - precision tests of lli with photons and particles ( protons , neutrons , electrons ) may provide insight into possible new physics and set limits on various theories .",
    "experimental breakthroughs in atomic , molecular and optical ( amo ) physics , including laser cooling and trapping of atoms , attainment of bose - einstein condensation , optical frequency combs , and quantum control led to extraordinary advances in the control of matter and light . these achievements , coupled with dramatic improvements in precision time and frequency metrology , measurement techniques such as atomic interferometry and magnetometry , and advances in first - principles atomic and molecular theory enabled a plethora of new applications of amo , including novel ways to test the fundamental physics laws .",
    "the availability of trapped ultracold atoms and ions , subject to precise interrogation and control , provided for new opportunities for tests of lorentz symmetry .",
    "a diverse set of amo lorentz - symmetry tests involves experiments with atomic clocks,@xcite other precision spectroscopy measurements,@xcite magnetometers,@xcite electromagnetic cavities,@xcite and quantum information trapped ion technologies.@xcite a cold cs atom clock test of lorentz invariance in the matter sector was carried out in ref .  , setting the best limits on the tensor lorentz - violating coefficients for the proton .    in 2015 , an experiment with a pair of trapped calcium ions improved bounds on lli - violating standard - model extension ( sme ) coefficients @xmath2 for electrons by a factor of 100 demonstrating the potential of quantum information techniques in the search for physics beyond the standard model.@xcite the same experiment can be interpreted as testing anisotropy in the speed of light , improving a previous such bound@xcite by a factor of 5 , with the sensitivity similar to more recent work reported in ref .  .",
    "lorentz - violation tests are analyzed in the context of the phenomenological framework known as the sme , which is an effective field theory that augments the standard - model lagrangian with every possible combination of the standard - model fields that is not term - by - term lorentz invariant , while maintaining gauge invariance , energy - momentum conservation , and observer lorentz invariance of the total action.@xcite violations of lorentz invariance and the einstein equivalence principle in bound electronic states result in a small shift of the hamiltonian that can be described by@xcite @xmath3 where we use atomic units , @xmath4 is the momentum of a bound electron , and @xmath5 is the speed of light .",
    "the parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are elements in the @xmath9 tensor which characterises hypothetical lorentz violation in the electron sector within the sme.@xcite the nonrelativistic form of the @xmath10 operator is @xmath11 . predicting the energy shift due to lli violation involves the calculation of the expectation value of the above hamiltonian for the atomic states of interest .",
    "therefore , the shift of the ca@xmath0 @xmath12 energy level due to the @xmath9 tensor depends on the values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 matrix elements .    the frequency difference ( in hz ) between the shifts of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 substates of the @xmath12 manifold",
    "was calculated in ref .",
    ": @xmath17 the basic idea of the ca@xmath0 experiment is to monitor this energy difference between the magnetic @xmath18 and @xmath19 substates of the @xmath12 @xmath20 manifold over time to set the limit on potential violation of lli .",
    "therefore , the shift of the ca@xmath0 @xmath12 energy level due to the @xmath9 tensor depended only on the value of @xmath14 matrix element , as the contribution of the scalar term canceled for the states of the same @xmath20 manifold .",
    "superposition of two ions prepared in a decoherence - free subspace @xmath21 where @xmath22 represents the @xmath12 state with @xmath23 and @xmath24 for the first and second ion , respectively , allowed elimination of the largest potential systematic uncertainty cased by the fluctuation of the magnetic field .",
    "details of the experiment are given in ref .  .",
    "further improvement of lli violation limits calls for a system with a long - lived ( or ground ) state that has a large @xmath25 matrix element .",
    "we have carried out a systematic study of this quantity for various systems and identified general rules for the enhancement of the reduced matrix elements of the @xmath26 operator.@xcite our calculations for @xmath27 states in ba@xmath0 and yb@xmath0 , which are heavier analogues of ca@xmath0 , found only a small increase of the @xmath26 matrix elements in comparison with the ca@xmath0 case .",
    "however , yb@xmath0 has another metastable level , @xmath28  @xmath29 with the @xmath30 matrix element that is over an order of magnitude larger than for the @xmath27 states .",
    "we find that deeper localization of the probe electron leads to enhanced sensitivity to the tensor lorentz violation .",
    "our study has shown that @xmath31 of @xmath320.8  a.u or below for the corresponding electron is a good indicator of the large value of the reduced @xmath26 matrix element .",
    "this condition is satisfied for the @xmath33 hole states , such as yb@xmath0 state considered here , or for highly charged ions with @xmath34 valence electrons and degree of ionization @xmath35 .",
    "the reduced @xmath26 matrix elements in yb@xmath0 and sm@xmath36 are 135  a.u . and 149 a.u .",
    ", respectively , in comparison of 9.3  a.u for the @xmath12 state in ca@xmath0 .",
    "the yb@xmath0 @xmath28  @xmath29 state also has an exceptionally long lifetime on the order of several years.@xcite therefore , the ramsey duration of the proposed experiment with yb@xmath0 is not limited by spontaneous decay during the measurement as in ca@xmath0 case .",
    "the electric - octupole e3 transition between the @xmath28  @xmath37 excited state and the ground state is used as the basis for the optical atomic clock with the single trapped yb@xmath0 ion , which presently has the lowest uncertainty among the all of the optical ion clocks.@xcite yb@xmath0 ions are also used in quantum information research.@xcite as a result , experimental techniques for precision control and manipulation of yb@xmath0 atomic states are particulary well developed making it an excellent candidate for searches of lorentz - violation signature .",
    "we estimated that experiments with the metastable @xmath28  @xmath37 state of yb@xmath0 can reach sensitivities of @xmath38 for the @xmath2 coefficients,@xcite over @xmath39 times more stringent than current best limits.@xcite moreover , the projected sensitivity to the @xmath40 coefficients will be at the level of @xmath41 , below the ratio between the electroweak and planck energy scales.@xcite similar sensitivities may potentially be reached for lv tests with highly charged ions , given future development of experimental techniques for these systems ."
