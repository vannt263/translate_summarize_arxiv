    "discovery of higgs bosons and exploration of their properties is the key to understanding electroweak symmetry breaking and a major step in uncovering the ultimate theory of particle physics .",
    "the higgs boson is the last missing piece of the standard model ( sm ) . in theories beyond the sm",
    "the higgs sector is typically more complicated ,  in the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) there are two higgs doublets which lead to five higgs bosons in the spectrum : light and heavy cp - even higgses , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , a cp - odd higgs , @xmath19 , and a pair of charged higgs bosons , @xmath20 . in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric model ( nmssm ) which contains an additional singlet superfield with complex component scalar field there are three cp - even higgses , @xmath21 , two cp - odd higgses , @xmath22 and a pair of charged higgs bosons ; and there are many simple models with an even more complicated higgs sector .",
    "since searches for higgs bosons rely on detection of their decay products , it is crucial to understand the way the higgs bosons decay .",
    "although it is usually the case that one of the higgs bosons has couplings to the @xmath23 bosons and to fermions that are close to those of the sm higgs , it is not necessarily true that such a higgs decays in the way the sm higgs does  @xcite .",
    "a significant model dependence of decay modes applies to other higgses as well .",
    "it has been recently argued that supersymmetric models in the region of parameter space for which @xmath24 is small and , in addition , there is a light doublet - like cp - odd higgs predict that all the higgses resulting from the two higgs doublets ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) could have been produced already at lep or the tevatron , but would have escaped detection because the decay modes have either not been searched for ( or the searches have been incomplete ) or are ones to which the experiments are not sensitive .",
    "although this scenario is ruled out in the mssm , it is only marginally disallowed for @xmath25 and @xmath26 and thus can possibly be viable in simple extensions of the mssm  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that for @xmath27 and @xmath28 the light cp - even higgs boson becomes sm - like , and although it is massless at the tree level , its mass will receive a contribution from superpartners and the tree level relation between the light cp - even and cp - odd higgses , @xmath29 , is dramatically changed by susy corrections . even for modest superpartner masses the light",
    "cp - even higgs boson will be heavier than @xmath30 . in particular , for superpartner masses between 300 gev and 1 tev and @xmath31",
    ", one finds @xmath32 gev and the @xmath33 decay mode is open and generically dominant .",
    "since the @xmath17 has sm - like @xmath34 couplings , @xmath35 is highly suppressed and the limits from the @xmath36 width measurements can be easily satisfied even for @xmath37 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath38 cross section would be maximal .",
    "however , for @xmath39 and @xmath40 the decay width of the @xmath19 is shared between @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 final states and thus the ( dominant ) @xmath44 decays are spread over many different final states : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , the latter being greatly suppressed relative to the sm expectation due to the presence of the @xmath44 decays . as a consequence ,",
    "the lep limits in each channel separately are very substantially weakened .",
    "of course , the decay mode independent limit requires a higgs with sm - like @xmath52 coupling to be above 82 gev  @xcite .",
    "it is this fact that rules out this scenario in the mssm , since there @xmath53 can not be pushed above 82 gev by radiative corrections .",
    "the rest of the higgs spectrum is basically not constrained at all in this scenario .",
    "the heavy cp - even and the cp - odd higgses could have been produced at lep in @xmath54 but they would have escaped detection because @xmath18 dominantly decays to @xmath55 - a mode that has not been searched for .",
    "additional constraints are discussed in detail in ref .",
    "the charged higgs is also very little constrained and up to @xmath56 of top quarks produced at the tevatron could have decayed into charged higgs and the @xmath57 quark since the dominant decay mode for the charged higgs @xmath58 with @xmath59 , @xmath43 or @xmath41 would not have been separated from the the generic top sample  .",
    "in addition , pair production of a charged higgs boson with the properties emerging in this scenario and mass close to the mass of the @xmath60 boson could explain the @xmath61 deviation from lepton universality in @xmath60 decays measured at lep  @xcite as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the mass of the light cp - even higgs is the only problematic part in this scenario .",
    "there are however various ways to increase the mass of the sm - like higgs boson in extensions of the mssm .",
    "a simple possibility is to consider singlet extensions of the mssm containing a @xmath62 term in the superpotential .",
    "it is known that this term itself contributes @xmath63 , where @xmath64 , to the mass squared of the cp - even higgs  @xcite and thus can easily push the higgs mass above the decay - mode independent limit of @xmath65 gev .",
    "note that this contribution is maximized for @xmath28 .",
    "in addition , it need not be the case that the light cp - even higgs has full strength @xmath52 coupling , in which case the model - independent limit on @xmath66 is reduced , while at the same time the @xmath67 which carries the rest of the @xmath52 coupling can have mass above the lep kinematic reach and/or decay to modes for which the lep limit of @xmath68 does not apply .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that in the nmssm it is possible to find scenarios in which the lightest cp - odd higgs has mass below @xmath69 and the two lightest cp - even higgs bosons and the charged higgs would all have been produced at lep and yet escaped detection .    in this paper",
    "we study nmssm scenarios with a light cp - odd higgs boson and small @xmath0 .",
    "we will in particular examine the subset of these scenarios in which the light cp - odd higgs boson is mainly doublet - like ( @xmath14-doublet - like scenarios ) and will find that they have many features in common with the mssm scenarios discussed above , except that they are not ruled out by higgs searches  they are phenomenologically viable even with very light superpartners . for the subset of the @xmath14-doublet - like scenarios in which the @xmath1 has nearly sm - like couplings , the @xmath1 can be as light as 82 gev ( the decay - mode independent limit ) by virtue of dominant decays @xmath70 , .",
    "there are also scenarios for which the @xmath1 has reduced coupling to @xmath52 , @xmath71 .   and @xmath60 through mixing , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite or to provide new higgs decay modes  @xcite .",
    "] in these latter cases , the cp - even higgs boson can have @xmath72 as low as @xmath73 gev .",
    "all these scenarios are similar to the scenario with a light singlet - like cp - odd higgs in the nmssm  @xcite in that it is the unexpected higgs decays that allow one or more light higgs bosons to have escaped lep detection .",
    "the important difference is that the scenario discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite is the usual decoupled scenario as far as the two higgs doublet part of the higgs spectrum is concerned ( the cp - odd higgs , the heavy cp - even higgs and the charged higgs are heavy and approximately degenerate ) and the light cp - odd higgs is supplied by the additional singlet . in contrast , in the @xmath14-doublet - like low-@xmath24 scenarios , the cp - even and cp - odd higgses coming from the additional singlet are typically heavy and do not drastically alter the two higgs doublet part of the higgs sector .",
    "the latter then looks like the higgs sector of the mssm with somewhat modified mass relations .",
    "as already mentioned the scenario with a light doublet - like cp - odd higgs and small @xmath0 is phenomenologically viable in the simplest extension of the mssm , the next - to - minimal supersymmetric model which adds only one singlet chiral superfield , @xmath75 .",
    "the very attractive nature of the nmssm extension of the mssm on general grounds has been discussed for many years @xcite ; in particular , it avoids the need for the @xmath76 parameter of the mssm superpotential term @xmath77 .",
    "the nmssm particle content differs from the mssm by the addition of one cp - even and one cp - odd state in the neutral higgs sector ( assuming cp conservation ) , and one additional neutralino .",
    "we will follow the conventions of @xcite . apart from the usual quark and lepton yukawa couplings , the scale invariant superpotential is [ 1.1 ]   _ u _ d +  ^3 depending on two dimensionless couplings @xmath78 , @xmath79 beyond the mssm",
    ". [ hatted ( unhatted ) capital letters denote superfields ( scalar superfield components ) . ]",
    "an effective @xmath76 term arises from the first term of eq .",
    "( [ 1.1 ] ) when the scalar component of @xmath80 acquires a vacuum expectation value , @xmath81 , yielding = s. the trilinear soft terms associated with the superpotential terms in eq .",
    "( [ 1.1 ] ) are [ 1.2 ] a _ s h_u",
    "h_d + a_s^3 .",
    "the final input parameter is [ 1.3 ] = h_u / h_d , where @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "the vevs @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , along with @xmath87 , can be viewed as determining the three  breaking masses squared for @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( denoted @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) through the three minimization equations of the scalar potential .",
    "thus , as compared to the three independent parameters needed in the mssm context ( often chosen as @xmath76 , @xmath0 and @xmath94 ) , the higgs sector of the nmssm is described by the six parameters [ 6param ]  ,  ,  a _  ,  a _ ,  ,  _  .",
    "( we employ a convention in which all parameters are evaluated at scale @xmath87 unless otherwise stated . )",
    "we will choose sign conventions for the fields such that @xmath78 and @xmath95 are positive , while @xmath79 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 should be allowed to have either sign .",
    "in addition , values must be input for the gaugino masses ( @xmath99 ) and for the soft terms related to the ( third generation ) squarks and sleptons ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 ) that contribute to the radiative corrections in the higgs sector and to the higgs decay widths . for small @xmath24 ,",
    "the soft parameters which play the most prominent role are @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath105 .",
    "a complete survey of the parameter space is difficult . to present results in a manageable way",
    ", we fix @xmath76 and @xmath0 together with all soft susy breaking masses and scan over trilinear and soft - trilinear couplings . we will plot results in various two - dimensional planes . the input parameters of eq .",
    "( [ 1.2 ] ) are scanned over the following regions with fixed steps : @xmath108 using 60 steps of size @xmath109 ; @xmath110 using 120 steps of size @xmath109 , with some refined scans for @xmath111 using 120 steps of size @xmath112 ; @xmath113 using 200 steps of size @xmath114 gev ; and finally @xmath115 using 200 steps of size @xmath114 gev , with refined scans for this same range with 1000 steps of size @xmath116 gev .",
    "varying the fixed soft susy breaking masses leads to smaller changes than does varying @xmath24 .",
    "thus , we will consider only a few choices of soft susy breaking masses and will focus on the important changes that occur as @xmath24 is changed .",
    "all scans are performed in the context of nmhdecay .",
    "nmhdecay checks a long list of experimental constraints , especially those coming from lep data .",
    "it also checks various theoretical constraints on the model incorporated , such as requiring that the vacuum be a true vacuum .",
    "nmhdecay also issues a warning if any of the couplings , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 or @xmath120 become non perturbative ( @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the yukawa couplings ) after evolution to the gut scale .",
    "we will consider scenarios in which these become non - perturbative as well as scenarios in which they remain perturbative . aside from this , all plotted points are consistent with all the nmhdecay constraints .",
    "as stated in the introduction , we wish to focus on cases for which @xmath121 .",
    "such scenarios have the most unusual features . in this mass region , it is important to incorporate the constraints arising from recently improved limits on @xmath122 with @xmath123 from cleo - iii  @xcite as well as old cusb - ii limits  @xcite on @xmath122 where @xmath14 is only assumed to be visible .",

    "overall , the nmssm provides a huge opportunity to have an `` ideal higgs '' boson scenario in which there is one or two light higgs bosons ( masses at or below @xmath168 ) that in combination have all the @xmath52-higgs coupling squared and therefore give values for the precision electroweak observables @xmath90 and @xmath254 that are in excellent agreement with data .",
