    "during the tp - agb phase , recurrent episodes of dredge - up can significantly affect the surface chemical composition of low- and intermediate - mass stars .",
    "these episodes are usually known as `` the third dredge - up '' .",
    "the basic mechanism of the mixing to the surface can be explained on the basis of the standard structure equations applied to stellar models in quasi - static evolution ( iben & renzini 1983 ) . during the peak of every flash in the helium shell , part of the nuclear energy",
    "is converted into thermal energy , and the remaining spent as mechanical work for the expansion of the overlaying matter .",
    "material at the hydrogen - helium ( @xmath11 ) discontinuity and beyond is pushed outward so that the h - burning shell is temporarily extinguished . at the same time , the base of the convective envelope moves inward because of the progressive local raising of the radiative temperature gradient over the adiabatic one , triggered by the increase of the energy flux and the concomitant decline of the temperature consequent to the expansion .",
    "dredge - up occurs if the convective envelope can penetrate into the inter - shell region containing material that has just undergone helium burning during the flash . a certain amount of inter - shell matter",
    "is then brought up to the surface , and pollutes the envelope with newly synthesised nuclear products .",
    "the dredge - up material mainly consists of helium , carbon , oxygen and traces of heavy elements produced by s - process nucleosynthesis ( see lattanzio & boothroyd 1997 for an extensive review of the topic ) .",
    "the formation of single carbon ( c- ) stars is usually ascribed to the enrichment of @xmath12c surface abundance produced by the third dredge - up .",
    "the topic is important for a series of reasons .",
    "first , c - stars are present in many local group galaxies , indicating the presence of relatively young stellar populations .",
    "the precise age and metallicity intervals relevant for the formation of c - stars , however , are far from being fully assessed from both theory and observations .",
    "secondly , these stars are crucial for the interpretation of a series of chemical abundance data .",
    "for instance , it is believed that most sic grains found in primitive meteorites are formed in extended carbon - rich envelopes of c - stars ( gallino et al .",
    "the emission features detected in the infrared spectra from extended circumstellar shells around agb stars are significantly affected by the composition of the dust grains ( ivezic & elitzur 1995 ) .",
    "the variety of chemical abundance patterns in planetary nebulae probably reflects the different efficiency and duration of dredge - up episodes in the progenitor stars , as well as the possible burning of cno isotopes at the base of their envelopes ( the so - called hot - bottom burning or envelope burning ; see marigo et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) .    in recent years",
    "many investigations have been devoted to the analysis of the occurrence and related efficiency of the dredge - up , and to the nucleosynthesis driven by thermal pulses ( boothroyd & sackmann 1988cd ; frost & lattanzio 1996 ; straniero et al .",
    "1997 ; lattanzio & boothroyd 1997 ; herwig et al .",
    "1997 ; and references therein ) .",
    "the main challenge of the theory in this case is offered by the so - called _ carbon star mystery _ , first pointed out by iben ( 1981 ) .",
    "observations of agb stars in the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) indicate that the luminosity range in which carbon stars are found extends down to rather faint magnitudes ( @xmath13 ) , thus suggesting the evolution from low - mass progenitors ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "in contrast , complete agb models easily explain the formation of carbon stars at much higher luminosities ( @xmath15 ) , but fail to reproduce the faint part of the observed distribution , since dredge - up of carbon is hardly found to occur during the tp - agb evolution of low - mass models .",
    "although some improvements have recently been attained ( frost & lattanzio 1996 ; straniero et al .  1997 ; herwig et al .",
    "1997 ) the present understanding of the dredge - up process is still unsatisfactory , mostly because of the uncertainties in the treatment of the mixing process and the definition of convective boundaries . in sect .",
    "[ pardup ] we give an overview of the present state of art emerging from the available results of complete modelling of the third dredge - up , and discuss the role of analytical tp - agb calculations in possibly giving useful theoretical indications .    in the present study , _",
    "the treatment of the third dredge - up in synthetic tp - agb calculations has been significantly improved .",
    "a simple technique based on integrations of static envelope models is used in order to infer if and when convective dredge - up is likely to occur during the evolution of a tp - agb star_. in this way , we abandon the assumption of a constant parameter @xmath2 , usually adopted in synthetic calculations ( groenewegen & de jong 1993 ; marigo et al .",
    "1996a ) , and the dependence on the current stellar mass and metallicity is taken into account .",
    "the method is described in sect .",
    "[ methdup ] .",
    "a primary target of theoretical models of the agb phase is the interpretation and reproduction of the observed cslfs in the magellanic clouds ( sect .",
    "[ cslf ] ) .",
    "this is because a sole observable holds a number of profound implications for different physical processes occurring in agb stars ( e.g.  nucleosynthesis , mixing and surface chemical enrichment , mass - loss ) , and sets at the same time severe constraints both on theoretical prediction of stellar parameters ( e.g.  evolutionary rates , luminosities , lifetimes , initial mass of carbon stars progenitors ) , and possibly on properties of the related stellar populations to which carbon stars belong ( e.g.  the history of star formation ) .",
    "section  [ theo_cslf ] illustrates the derivation of theoretical cslfs .    in this study the formation of carbon stars",
    "is investigated with the aid of the parameterized treatment of the third dredge - up . in sect .",
    "[ calibr ] , the dredge - up parameters ( efficiency @xmath3 , and base temperature @xmath1 of the envelope at the post - flash luminosity peak ) are first determined by demanding that the theoretical cslf , calculated for initial metallicity @xmath16 , suitably fits the distribution observed in the lmc . this calibration is important not only for deriving theoretical indications on the dredge - up process itself , but also because it gives more reliability to the analysis on the surface chemical composition of agb stars and related applications ( e.g.  estimation of chemical yields , and chemical abundances in planetary nebulae ) . the sensitivity of the results to the underlying history of star formation and the initial mass function ( imf ) is also explored .    the same procedure is then applied to find the proper pair of parameters to reproduce the cslf in the smc ( sect .",

    "a tp - agb star can experience the third dredge - up when its core mass has grown over a critical value @xmath2 , as indicated by theoretical analyses of thermal pulses ( e.g.  wood 1981 ; iben & renzini 1983 ; boothroyd & sackmann 1988cd ; lattanzio 1989 ) .",
    "estimates of @xmath2 based on complete evolutionary calculations are still a matter of debate , since this quantity depends on the delicate interplay between model prescriptions ( e.g.  opacities , nuclear reaction rates , convection theory , mass - loss , time and mass resolution ) and intrinsic properties of the star ( e.g.  chemical composition , envelope mass , strength of the thermal pulses ) . in table  [ litmcmin ] we report some values of @xmath2 taken from different authors .",
    "it turns out that the results vary remarkably , even among models with the same total mass and metallicity .",
    "the third dredge - up is often not found in low - mass models , and if it is , the corresponding metallicities are quite low and the transition luminosities [ see the @xmath21 entry ] are in most cases still brighter than the faint wing of the cslfs in the magellanic clouds .",
    "nevertheless , a certain trend can be extracted from the comparison of the results , i.e.  the onset of the third dredge - up is favoured at higher stellar mass @xmath32 , lower metallicity @xmath18 , and greater efficiency of envelope convection ( obtained e.g.  by increasing the mixing - length parameter @xmath20 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 expresses the dredge - up efficiency .",
    "it is defined as the fraction of the core mass increment over the preceding inter - pulse period , @xmath33 , which is dredged - up to the surface by the downward penetration of the convective envelope : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the mass of the dredged - up material .",
    "the question of the true value of @xmath3 is also troublesome .",
    "the effective penetration of the envelope is crucially affected by the treatment of the instability of matter against convection , still poorly understood . in the standard approach ,",
    "the boundary of a convective region is defined by the schwarzschild criterion , i.e.where the inward gravity force is balanced by the buoyancy force . however , at this point the velocity of the convective eddies is not null , so that they can effectively penetrate into formally stable regions .",
    "this phenomenon is usually known as convective overshoot . over the years",
    ", several attempts have been made in order to include this effect into evolutionary calculations ( see chiosi et al .",
    "1992 and references therein ) .",
    "however , at present it appears that there is no real agreement among different authors on the criterion to define the maximum inward penetration of the envelope at thermal pulses during the agb .",
    "moreover , the results seem to depend quite sensitively on technical and numerical details ( see frost & lattanzio 1996 for a discussion of this aspect ) .",
    "the heterogeneous situation is well represented by the two following examples .",
    "on the one side , straniero et al .",
    "( 1997 ) obtain rather efficient dredge - up just using the schwarzschild criterion and without invoking any extra - mixing , but drastically increasing both time and mass resolution during calculations . on the other hand , herwig et al.(1997 ) find deep extra - mixing during dredge - up on the basis of a parameterized description of the overshoot region , built up to mimic the indications from hydrodynamical simulations ( freytag et al .",
    "1996 ) of convection in stars of a different kind ( i.e.  main sequence stars and white dwarfs ) .",
    "as far as the efficiency of the third dredge - up is concerned , it is not easy to summarise the results from different authors .",
    "however , suffice it to recall that recurrent estimates , derived from tp - agb calculations of low - mass stars , give at most @xmath36 and often even smaller ( iben & renzini 1984 ; lattanzio 1986 , 1987 , 1989 ; boothroyd & sackmann 1988d ; straniero et al .",
    "1997 ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "the present state of art is the following . on the one hand , most authors still do not find significant dredge - up in their calculations ( vassiliadis & wood 1993 ; wagenhuber 1996 ; see also table  [ litmcmin ] ) , or assume the efficiency @xmath3 as an input quantity ( forestini & charbonnel 1997 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the difficulty of a too poor dredge - up in low - mass stars seems to be overcome to some extent ( boothroyd & sackmann 1988d ; frost & lattanzio 1996 ; straniero et al .  1997 ; herwig et al .",
    "1997 ) , but extensive calculations over a wide range of stellar masses and metallicities are required to test the results by means of a meaningful comparison with observations . moreover , results are quite different even for similar initial conditions ( e.g.  @xmath32 and @xmath18 ) .",
    "a powerful investigation tool complementary to full calculations is offered by synthetic tp - agb models , which have been notably improved and up - graded in recent years ( groenewegen & de jong 1993 ; marigo et al .  1996a , 1998 ; marigo 1998ab ) .",
    "as far as the third dredge - up is concerned , synthetic tp - agb calculations clearly suggest that a higher efficiency is required ( e.g.  @xmath37 ) in order to reproduce observational constraints ( e.g.  the cslf in the lmc ) , a goal still missed by complete modelling of the tp - agb phase .",
    "the use of the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 plays a relevant role in analytical models of the tp - agb phase .",
    "they both significantly affect the predicted luminosity functions of carbon stars , in particular the position of the peak and the low - luminosity tail of the distribution . lowering @xmath2 favours the formation of carbon stars of lower masses and at the same time results in a longer carbon star phase ; increasing @xmath3 corresponds to a higher fraction of low mass stars which become carbon stars at fainter luminosities . in marigo",
    "( 1996a ) it was simply assumed that both @xmath2 and @xmath3 were constant , thus neglecting their likely dependence on the stellar metallicity , total mass , core mass , and mixing length parameter . though being a rough approximation , such a choice was meant to provide useful theoretical indications .",
    "the calibration of the dredge - up parameters was based on the goal of reproducing the observed cslfs in the lmc .",
    "it resulted that the suitable values were @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "these values are very close to those derived by groenewegen & de jong ( 1993 ) . basing on these results , forestini & charbonnel ( 1997 ) fixed @xmath40 in their full calculations , in order to estimate the chemical yields from intermediate - mass stars .",
    "in this section we illustrate the adopted scheme which replaces the assumption of a constant @xmath2 . to start with ,",
    "it is necessary to consider some indications about the dredge - up provided by detailed calculations of thermal pulses .",
    "they show that the maximum inward penetration of the envelope convection , over the pulse cycle , occurs when the surface luminosity attains its characteristic post - flash peak , @xmath41 ( wood 1981 ; wood & zarro 1981 ; boothroyd & sackmann 1988d ) .",
    "dredge - up takes place if the envelope convection zone is able to penetrate into the carbon enriched region previously occupied by the inter - shell convection zone during the flash .    in sects .",
    "[ lpeak ] and [ tdred ] below we recall and discuss the features which are relevant to our analysis on the occurrence of the dredge - up , namely the behaviour of the peak luminosity @xmath41 , and the temperature at the base of the convective envelope during the dredge - up events . in sect .",
    "[ mcmin ] the method to infer @xmath42 for each agb model is described , and the results for several values of the stellar mass and metallicity are presented .",
    "section  [ chemdred ] details the adopted inter - shell composition .",
    "wood & zarro ( 1981 ) and wood ( 1981 ) pointed out that at the surface luminosity maximum the outward - flowing luminosity , @xmath44 , is almost constant ( to a fraction of a percent ) throughout the envelope , from the top of the remnant inter - shell convection zone to the surface .",
    "this is because the thermal timescale in the envelope ( i.e.  for absorption / release of internal - gravitational energy during the hydrostatic re - adjustment following the flash ) is much shorter ( i.e. few years ) than the evolutionary timescale for the envelope structure to be changed ( i.e. decades to centuries ) .",
    "the constancy of @xmath44 may no longer be true when significant energy absorption can occur in the envelope , e.g.  in stars with quite massive envelopes ( @xmath45 ) , or large core masses ( @xmath46 ) ( wood & zarro 1981 ) .",
    "the fact that at the post - flash luminosity maximum the envelope is close to hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium ( wood 1981 ) , together with the existence of a radiative buffer over the burning shell , constitute the necessary physical conditions which secure the validity of the so - called zero - order - radiative - approximation ( schwarzschild 1958 ; eggleton 1967 ; paczyski 1970 ; wood & zarro 1981 ) . in brief , theory shows that @xmath41 is essentially controlled by the core mass of the star independently of the outer envelope mass , in analogy with the existence of the @xmath47 relation during the quiescent inter - pulse periods for low - mass agb stars . for more details on the basic conditions that underlie the theory of a core mass - luminosity relationship",

    "we adopt the @xmath48 relation presented by wagenhuber & groenewegen ( 1998 ) , derived from extensive calculations of complete agb models ( wagenhuber 1996 ) .",
    "it expresses the post - flash luminosity maximum as the sum of two terms , i.e.@xmath49 , where @xmath50 \\times \\\\\\nonumber & & \\left\\ { m_{\\rm c}-[0.503 + 0.82 ( z-0.02 ) ] \\right\\ } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath51 }   \\ ] ] the former term [ eq .",

    "the latter term [ eq .",
    "( [ dlp ] ) ] represents a negative correction which has to be added to @xmath55 in order to reproduce the fainter maximum in the light - curve ( at given @xmath53 ) for the first pulses , expressed as a function of the core mass at the first he - shell flash , @xmath56 , and the current core mass increment , @xmath57 .      following wood ( 1981 ) , at the post - flash luminosity peak the envelope convection reaches its maximum inward penetration ( in mass fraction ) and base temperature , @xmath58 . at the same time , the nuclearly processed material involved in the he - shell flash is pushed out and cooled down to its minimum temperature over the flash - cycle , @xmath59 .",
    "to this respect , a very interesting and useful indication is given by wood ( 1981 ) , who reported that at the stage of post - flash luminosity maximum , the temperature @xmath59 always approaches a limiting constant value ( @xmath60 ) , for all core masses studied ( @xmath61 ) , regardless of the metallicity ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 )",
    ".    a similar remark can be found in the work by boothroyd & sackmann ( 1988d ) about the production of low - mass carbon stars . in the final discussion",
    "the authors stated that `` it is probably no coincidence '' that in all cases considered ( i.e.  full agb calculations for stars with total mass and metallicity [ @xmath65 , [ @xmath66 , [ @xmath67 , and [ @xmath68 ) the first episode of convective dredge - up is characterised by a temperature at the base of the convective envelope of approximately the same value , @xmath69 . in other words , @xmath70 at the first occurrence of the third dredge - up .    in conclusion",
    ", detailed analyses of thermal pulses suggest that the third dredge - up takes place when the base temperature attains or exceeds some critical value .",
    "hereinafter , we will refer to it as @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , we adopt the following criterion :    * if @xmath71 no dredge - up can occur * if @xmath72 dredge - up occurs    on the basis of the above considerations , it is natural to assume that the fulfilment of the condition @xmath73 for the first time during the evolution marks the onset of dredge - up .",
    "thanks to the fact that at the time of the maximum penetration of the external convection the envelope is in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium ( sect .",
    "[ lpeak ] ) , and that @xmath74 when dredge - up occurs ( sect .",
    "[ tdred ] ) , it follows that the question of the minimum core mass for dredge - up can be analysed with the aid of a stationary envelope model .",
    "envelope integrations are performed on the basis of the following scheme . according to the analytical demonstration of tuchman et al.(1983 ) it turns out that in the zero - order - radiative - approximation ( see also schwarzschild 1958 ; eggleton 1967 ; paczyski 1970 ) the product of the temperature @xmath75 and radius @xmath76 just above the burning shell , depends on the surface luminosity , core mass @xmath53 , and chemical composition of the radiative transition region : @xmath77\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is given in k , @xmath78 , @xmath53 and @xmath79 are expressed in solar units , @xmath80 and @xmath18 are the abundances ( in mass fraction ) of hydrogen and metals , respectively .",

    "1996a ) .",
    "there is one more prescription to be discussed , i.e.  the adopted value of the characteristic temperature for convective dredge - up , @xmath117 .",
    "as already mentioned , indications come from detailed analyses of thermal pulses , such as @xmath119 in the work by wood ( 1981 ) , and @xmath120 found by boothroyd & sackmann ( 1988d ) .",
    "wood ( 1981 ) first performed a similar kind of analysis adopted here to infer @xmath2 from envelope integrations .",
    "the author aimed at investigating the theoretical incapability of reproducing the observed carbon stars of low luminosity , i.e.  no low - mass ( @xmath121 ) and faint ( @xmath122 ) carbon stars were predicted to form according to full agb calculations .",
    "he suggested that the problem could be partially alleviated if the onset of the dredge - up episodes occurs much earlier during the tp - agb evolution of low - mass stars .",
    "this implies a smaller @xmath2 than found in full calculations ( see table  [ litmcmin ] ) .",
    "the question was considered by arbitrarily changing the value of the mixing - length parameter , initially set to @xmath123 .",
    "the net result was to lower systematically the minimum total mass for dredge - up at increasing @xmath20 , whereas the corresponding @xmath2 was slightly affected .",
    "moreover , it became clear that , for given stellar mass @xmath32 , @xmath2 increases with @xmath18 and , for given @xmath18 , it decreases with @xmath32 .",
    "boothroyd & sackmann ( 1988d ) also addressed the problem of the formation of low - mass carbon stars by analysing the effect of adopting high values of the mixing length parameter [ e.g.  @xmath124 was necessary to produce a @xmath125 carbon star with @xmath126 and a luminosity at the post - flash dip @xmath127 , or equivalently @xmath128 ; see also table  [ litmcmin ] ] .",
    "the authors remarked that the value of @xmath20 has a large effect on the depth in temperature of the convective envelope , but it has a relatively small effect on the depth in mass .",
    "in fact , the base of the convective envelope is located in a zone containing a very small mass [ @xmath129 , but across which the temperature gradient is extremely steep .",
    "moreover , boothroyd & sackmann ( 1988d ) concluded that the experiment of varying @xmath20 , though useful , can not definitively solve the problem of dredge - up .",
    "these considerations suggest us the possibility of performing the analysis on the occurrence of third dredge - up from a different perspective , in the sense that we keep the mixing - length parameter fixed at its value ( @xmath130 ) derived from the calibration of the solar model , calculated with the complete evolutionary code of padua ( girardi et al .",
    "we specify that the adopted opacities are taken from iglesias & rogers ( 1996 ; opal ) in the high - temperature domain ( @xmath131 k ) , and from alexander & feguson ( 1994 ) in the low - temperature domain ( @xmath132 k ) .",
    "we analyze , instead , the effect of assuming different values of the characteristic temperature for dredge - up .",
    "the lower @xmath1 , the smaller is the value @xmath2 . to this respect , we can safely state that increasing @xmath20 produces the same effect on @xmath2 as decreasing @xmath1 .    the reasons why we opt for such a choice are the following .",
    "first , we want to secure the continuity of the tp - agb calculations with the previous evolution , entirely followed using @xmath130 .",
    "this does not mean at all that in reality the efficiency of the convective mixing can not change during the evolution of the star .",
    "however , since the present theoretical treatment of the convection is indeed inadequate to predict possible variations of @xmath20 , we prefer to assume a conservative position .",
    "second , the occurrence of convective dredge - up is not only conditioned by the properties of external convection ( e.g.  by the choice of @xmath20 ) , but it also depends on the physical characteristics of the inter - shell region directly involved in the flash .",
    "detailed calculations clearly indicate that a higher strength of the pulse , ( usually measured by the maximum luminosity of the he - shell ) corresponds to a greater amount of energy spent to expand outward the nuclearly processed material , that would be cooled down more efficiently ( boothroyd & sackmann 1988d ; straniero et al .",
    "1997 ) .    therefore , artificially decreasing @xmath117 is equivalent to hypothesising stronger thermal pulses .",
    "this is a viable experiment in a theoretical approach making use of a static envelope model .",
    "in fact , our analysis is not directed to investigate the effective penetration of the convective envelope , since that would require us to carefully follow ( i.e.  with a complete stellar code ) the onset and the time development of each thermal pulse . obviously , an impossible task using only envelope integrations .",
    "the essential goal of this study is to simply derive useful indications on the possible occurrence of convective dredge - up , on the basis of physical aspects which can be properly handled by our investigative tool .      in this section",

    ", we explore both the cases @xmath134 ( from wood 1981 ) and @xmath135 ( following boothroyd & sackmann 1988d ) to calculate @xmath0 as a function of the stellar mass for the set of models with original composition [ @xmath136 .",

    "the comparison of these curves with the values of the core mass at the starting of the thermally pulsing regime ( short - dashed line ) allows one to get an approximate estimate of the core - mass increment necessary before the star begins to become carbon - enriched .",
    "it turns out that stars with masses @xmath140 enter the tp - agb phase with a core mass that is greater than the corresponding @xmath2 , for all the three values of temperature @xmath117 under study , i.e.  the third dredge - up should already occur at the first pulse ( or , more likely , as soon as the full - amplitude regime is established ) . on the contrary",
    ", stars with lower masses ( @xmath141 ) are expected to evolve through a longer part of the tp - agb without undergoing any chemical pollution by convective dredge - up .",
    "moreover , it is worth noticing that each possible choice of @xmath142 determines a different value of the minimum total mass , @xmath143 , for a star to experience dredge - up . in the @xmath4 case ,",

    ", our analysis confirms that for given stellar mass , the onset of convective dredge - up is favoured at lower metal abundances in the envelope .",
    "it is worth noticing that the minimum mass , @xmath143 , is affected in the same direction .",
    "according to our calculations , we get @xmath151 for @xmath111 , @xmath152 for @xmath4 , and @xmath153 for @xmath9 .",
    "this result seems to be consistent with the observed data of carbon stars in the magellanic clouds ( see sect .  [ cslf ] ) : the faint end of the luminosity distribution of carbon stars in the smc ( with a mean metallicity @xmath154 ) extends to a fainter luminosity ( @xmath155 ) , than in the lmc ( @xmath156 , with a mean @xmath157 ) , thus suggesting a lower @xmath143 at lower metallicities .",
    "we like to stress once more that the onset of the mixing events in low - mass stars is a fundamental aspect , since it crucially affects the distribution of the carbon stars in the low - luminosity domain . as will be shown below ( from a systematic analysis ) ,",
    "the value @xmath158 is found suitable to fulfill the above constraint ( sect .",

    "this is particularly relevant in the low - mass domain , where the curves become very steep , i.e.  minor variations of the total mass correspond to quite different values of @xmath2 .",
    "since tp - agb calculations are performed with the inclusion of mass loss by stellar winds , it follows that _ in the case of low - mass stars a small reduction of the envelope mass may significantly delay , or even prevent the onset of dredge - up_.    figure  [ ftdred ] shows the maximum temperature at the base of the convective envelope , @xmath58 , at the stage of post - flash luminosity peak , as a function of the core mass during the evolution of a few stellar models with different masses @xmath32 at the beginning of the tp - agb phase , and original metallicity @xmath4 ( see sect .",

    "the model with @xmath161 corresponds to the lowest mass for a star to become carbon - enriched .",
    "higher mass stars are able to attain hot base temperatures , so that they are expected to experience dredge - up already since the first pulses .",
    "the present method also provides the possibility of predicting the stage beyond which dredge - up can not occur any longer during the final tp - agb evolution .",
    "the shut - down of dredge - up may happen when the envelope mass becomes so small that the condition @xmath162 is no longer satisfied .",
    "this circumstance occurs for the last pulses of the tracks displayed in fig .",
    "[ ftdred ] , characterized by the drastic reduction of the envelope mass due to stellar winds .",
    "this point represents another important improvement for synthetic tp - agb models , since the end of the dredge - up episodes is not fixed a priori ( a necessary assumption if one adopts a constant value for @xmath2 ) , but naturally derives from calculations .",
    "the remaining ingredient of our models is the composition of the dredged - up material .",
    "we use the same formalism as in marigo et al.(1996a ) , to whom we refer for an extensive description of this point . suffice it to recall that our prescription is based on the detailed calculations of the inter - shell nucleosynthesis carried out by boothroyd & sackmann ( 1988c ) .",
    "they find that the convective inter - shell after a thermal pulse and just before the penetration of the envelope is composed by @xmath163  % of @xmath12c , @xmath164  % of @xmath165o , and the remainder of @xmath166he ( in mass fractions ) .",
    "these proportions are reached after the first few thermal pulses , and do not significantly depend on the core mass and metallicity .",
    "recently , herwig et al .  (",
    "1997 ) have pointed out that the abundances in the inter - shell will differ significantly from the results of standard calculations ( i.e.  without extra - mixing as in boothroyd & sackmann 1988c ) , if instead one applies their overshooting scheme to all convective zones .",
    "the resulting chemical distribution of the dredged - up material typically consists of @xmath167 in @xmath12c , @xmath168 in @xmath165o , and @xmath168 in @xmath166he .    in this study",
    "we opt for the conservative standard prescription of boothroyd & sackmann ( 1988c ) .",
    "the following fixed abundances are adopted : 22% for @xmath12c produced by the triple alpha reaction and 2% for @xmath165o produced by the reaction @xmath12c(@xmath169)@xmath165o .",
    "the evolutionary calculations presented in this study have been carried out for a dense grid of stellar masses ( @xmath170 ) and two values of the initial metallicity , @xmath4 and @xmath9 .",

    "suffice it to recall here that the synthetic model combines analytical relations with a complete stellar envelope , which is integrated from the photosphere down to the core .",
    "the evolution of a tp - agb star is followed from the first thermal pulse up to the complete ejection of the envelope , adopting the prescription for mass loss as suggested by vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 ) .",
    "a homogeneous set of accurate analytical relations ( e.g.  the core mass - luminosity relation , the core mass - interpulse period ) is taken from the recent work by wagenhuber & groenewegen ( 1998 ) .",
    "finally , it is worth remarking that the occurrence of envelope burning ( or hot - bottom burning ) in more massive tp - agb stars ( @xmath171 ) is consistently followed to account for the possible break - down of the @xmath172 relation ( see marigo 1998b ) .",

[ sbr ] ) ; and @xmath216 is the time each star of mass @xmath217 spends in the @xmath218 luminosity interval .",

    "let us now discuss the meaning of the two basic functions in eq .",
    "( [ dncstar ] ) , namely @xmath230 and @xmath216 .",
    "it is useful to split the stellar birth rate @xmath231 into the product of two functions ( see tinsley 1980 ) : @xmath232 where @xmath233 is the initial mass function ( imf ) expressing the fraction of stars forming with masses in the range @xmath234 $ ] .",

    "this can be expressed by : @xmath242 \\label{sff}\\ ] ] since there is a unique correspondence between the lifetime of a star ( of given metallicity ) and its initial mass , @xmath243 , it is possible to consider @xmath231 as a function solely of the stellar mass .",
    "the quantity @xmath216 is the time that a star with initial mass @xmath217 spends in the @xmath218 luminosity bin of width @xmath211 .",
    "it is directly derived from the tp - agb evolutionary tracks .",
    "a useful approximation for interpreting the results is that the quiescent luminosity of tp - agb stars follows an almost constant rate of brightening ( see e.g.  iben 1981 ) : @xmath244 actually , this relation holds if the following conditions are met .",
    "first , the relation between the quiescent luminosity @xmath245 and the core mass @xmath53 should be linear .",
    "this would correspond to consider only the terms ( 5a ) and ( 5b ) of eq .",
    "( 5 ) giving the @xmath172 relation adopted by marigo ( 1998b ) .",
    "this implies the neglect of both the initial sub - luminous evolution of the first inter - pulse periods , and the possible deviations towards higher luminosities caused by envelope burning .",
    "this assumptions are reasonable for carbon stars since their formation generally occurs after the onset of the full amplitude regime , and only when envelope burning is not efficiently operating . in this case : @xmath246 on the other hand , the evolutionary rate ( i.e.  the growth rate of the core mass ) is proportional to the stellar luminosity : @xmath247 in the above equations @xmath248 and @xmath249 are suitable constants .",
    "if the changes in the envelope abundance of hydrogen , @xmath80 , are small enough , it follows that @xmath250 can be eliminated from the above equations giving @xmath251 , which is equivalent to eq .",

    "if we consider only the evolution of the quiescent luminosity ( see , however , sect .",
    "[ dip ] below ) , the resulting cslf would be described by a box - like distribution .",
    "a final remark is worth making .",
    "since dredge - up periodically reduces the core mass , then it is expected to affect the average evolutionary rate @xmath255 .",

    "[ calibr ] and  [ smc ] .",
    "several interesting features can be noticed from the inspection of these figures .",
    "first , the formation of carbon stars may be prevented because of missing or insufficient dredge - up in the range of lower masses , or significantly delayed due to the occurrence of envelope burning in the most massive agb stars .",
    "second , for the majority of low - mass carbon stars ( with no envelope burning ; @xmath261 ; see marigo 1998b ) the maximum luminosity just coincides with the tip of the agb reached at the end of their evolution . on the contrary , in more massive carbon stars ( @xmath262 )",
    "the occurrence of envelope burning can lead to a different configuration .",
    "it may happen that the onset of envelope burning takes place after the star has already experienced a sufficient number of dredge - up episodes to become a carbon star .",
    "nuclear burning at the base of the envelope subsequently destroys carbon , lowering the c / o ratio again below unity .",

    "[ mcmin ] that with the new algorithm based on envelope integrations , at fixed @xmath1 the behaviour of @xmath2 as a function of @xmath32 is far from being constant , but steeply increasing for lower values of the mass .",
    "moreover , the onset of the third dredge - up is favoured at lower @xmath18",
    ".    figure  [ mcdredz008 ] illustrates the core mass  necessarily @xmath283  just before the occurrence of the first dredge - up episode as a function of the total mass at the starting of the tp - agb phase for the evolutionary models calculated with initial metallicity @xmath4 and @xmath9 .",
    "the comparison with the previous fig .",
    "[ mcminz008 ] shows the following differences .    *",
    "first , the core mass at the first dredge - up event does not increase so steeply as @xmath2 in the range of low - mass stars @xmath284 .",
    "this is the result of the extreme sensitivity of @xmath2 to the current stellar mass .",
    "even small reduction of the envelope actually prevents the formation of carbon stars in the steepest part of the curve shown in fig .",
    "[ mcminz008 ] . *",
    "second , the core mass at the onset of the third dredge - up is found to increase for stars with @xmath285 . in this mass range , it reflects the behaviour of the core mass at the first thermal pulse ( which increases with stellar mass ) , and not the flattening predicted for @xmath2 . *",
    "finally , the core masses in the low - mass range indicated in fig .  [ mcdredz008 ] are somewhat larger than the corresponding ones shown in fig .  [ mcminz008 ] .",
    "the reason is partly due to the fact that the results illustrated in this latter plot are derived from calculations in which @xmath286 ( see sect .  [ lpeak ] ) , whereas the term @xmath287 has been neglected in the envelope integrations performed to construct fig .",
    "[ mcminz008 ] .",
    "this simplification was adopted because @xmath288 contains a dependence on the core mass at the first thermal pulse [ see eq .",
    "( [ dlp ] ) ] , whereas at that stage we simply aimed at deriving the behaviour of @xmath2 as a function of the current stellar mass .",
    "the neglect of @xmath287 leads one to overestimate @xmath41 for a given core mass , thus yielding slightly lower values of @xmath2 .    comparing the curves for the same @xmath150 and metallicities @xmath4 and @xmath9 , it turns out that at decreasing metallicity the core mass at the first dredge - up episode is smaller in the low - mass range ( @xmath289 ) , whereas it is larger at higher stellar masses ( ( @xmath290 ) .",
    "this is explained as following .",
    "the fact that at lower metallicities the minimum base temperature for dredge - up is attained at lower values of @xmath291 ( and hence @xmath53 ) is only relevant in the low - mass domain , since the onset of the third dredge - up at larger stellar masses essentially reproduces the trend of the core mass at the first thermal pulse , which actually increases at decreasing metallicities for given stellar mass .",
    "cccc @xmath18 & @xmath292 & @xmath293 & age ( yr ) + 0.008 & 6.7 & 2.00 ( 2.0 ) & @xmath294 + & 6.5 & 1.83 ( 1.8 ) & @xmath295 + & 6.4 & 1.32 ( 1.2 ) & @xmath296 + 0.004 & 6.4 & 1.13 ( 1.1 ) & @xmath297 +    moreover , if we now compare the two curves plotted in fig .",
    "[ mcdredz008 ] , for two values of @xmath1 and and the same @xmath4 , it turns out that the temperature parameter determines the minimum mass for a tp - agb star to experience chemical pollution by convective dredge - up .",
    "the lower is @xmath1 the lower is this limit mass .",
    "then , for a given mass - loss prescription applied to the previous evolution ( i.e.  during the rgb and part of the agb up to the onset of dredge - up ) , we can derive the corresponding stellar mass at the zams .",
    "in other words , @xmath1 fixes a lower limit to the minimum initial mass , @xmath293 , for a star to become a carbon star , and hence an upper limit to the oldest age of the stellar population possibly contributing to the observed distribution ( see table [ mincarbz008 ] ) .",
    "another interesting point to be stressed is that the results shown in fig .",
    "[ mcdredz008 ] are determined by the temperature parameter only ( since @xmath3 can not have any effect prior to dredge - up ) .",
    "this fact allows us to predict already that the value @xmath281 should be ruled out , otherwise we would miss the low - luminosity tail of the lmc cslf .",
    "let us consider the minimum ( with @xmath298 ) of the corresponding curve in fig .",
    "[ mcdredz008 ] , referring to a star with @xmath299 . even in the most favourable ( but quite unlikely ) hypothesis ,",
    "that the transition to the c - class occurs soon after the first dredge - up episodes ( this would require @xmath265 ) , the corresponding luminosity derived from the @xmath172 relation would be @xmath300 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath301 , and even adding @xmath302 mag ( i.e.  the typical depth of the low - luminosity dip ; see sect .

    "the minimum of the curve is at @xmath304 , with @xmath305 .",
    "applying the same reasoning , we would obtain the faintest carbon stars at @xmath306 .",
    "the latter value is consistent with observed faint end of the cslf in the lmc .",
    "even if a full discussion on the carbon star transition luminosity as a function of the stellar mass can not be developed without considering the combined effect of @xmath1 and @xmath3 , we can conclude from the previous analysis that _ the temperature parameter , @xmath1 , mainly determines the faint end of the cslf_.      let us now analyse the role of the dredge - up efficiency parameter @xmath3 .",
    "we remind that @xmath10 was the suitable value estimated by marigo et al .",
    "( 1996a ) such that , together with @xmath307 , the cslf in the lmc was reproduced .",
    "the top and middle panels of fig .",
    "[ cstar3 ] show the theoretical distributions of carbon stars adopting @xmath39 , for @xmath308 and @xmath309 , respectively .",
    "none of them fits the observed histogram .    in the case with ( @xmath281 , @xmath10 ) , the theoretical distribution",
    "is systematically shifted to brighter luminosities , with respect to the observed one .",
    "the opposite situation is found with the combination ( @xmath7 , @xmath10 ) , which produces the peak of the predicted cslf at a fainter magnitude than observed , with an excess of carbon stars at lower luminosity , and conversely a deficit in the brighter domain .",
    "note , however , that contrary to the previous result with ( @xmath310 , @xmath10 ) , both extremes of the observed distribution are fitted .",
    "this circumstance suggests that the we are only required to shift the peak of the histogram into the right luminosity bin .",
    "we find that this can be obtained by decreasing the parameter @xmath3 while keeping fixed @xmath7 , rather than varying the temperature parameter itself .",
    "there are two main reasons .",
    "first , the constraint set by the faint end of the distribution , which has been already fulfilled with the choice @xmath311 , would be violated with a higher value of @xmath1 .",
    "second , we expect that a suitable decrease of @xmath3 could move the peak into the right location , and reproduce the faint tail of the distribution at the same time .",
    "in fact , the transition luminosity for a star with a very low - mass envelope ( @xmath312 ) is only slightly affected by changes of @xmath3 ( provided that @xmath313 , since @xmath314 dredge - up episodes generally suffice to cause the transition to carbon star .    concluding this discussion",
    ", we remark that _ once @xmath5 has been determined , the efficiency parameter @xmath3 essentially controls the peak location of the cslf .",

    "we investigate the sensitivity of the predictions on both functions .",
    "let us first analyse the effect due to the sfr history , while fixing the imf equal to salpeter s ( 1955 ) prescription .",

    "* are there any distinctive features of the cslf setting constraints on the history of sfr ? * what is more important in shaping the observed cslf , the efficiency of the dredge - up process or the time evolution of the sfr ?",
    "first of all , it is clear that the possible indications the cslf may give on the history of the sfr are restricted to the age interval defined by the minimum and maximum initial mass of the progenitors ( @xmath293 and @xmath316 , respectively ) .",
    "specifically , we deal with the age interval ranging from about @xmath317 yr down to @xmath318 yr , corresponding to stellar lifetimes for @xmath319 and @xmath320 , respectively",
    ". the lower limit of the mass range is determined by the temperature parameter , @xmath321 ( see sect .",
    "[ tbmax ] ) .",
    "an interesting result comes out when comparing the theoretical distributions , each corresponding to a single stellar generation , as a function of the initial mass of the progenitor , or equivalently , of the age .",

    "[ ratebri ] ) with the probability function described in sect .",
    "[ dip ] . from this figure",
    ", it turns out that all the histograms relative to stars with initial masses @xmath322 have a faint wing extending within the same luminosity range , and more importantly , all the peaks fall into the same bin .",
    "this is explained considering that , within this mass range , ( i ) stars are found to make the transition to the c - class at quite similar luminosities ( i.e.@xmath323 ; see fig .",
    "[ limbolz008 ] ) , and ( ii ) they span as carbon stars a luminosity interval which is comparable to the typical excursion of the low - luminosity dip , i.e.  @xmath324 mag .    in view of this similarity",
    ", we expect that the faint wing of the integrated cslf is not significantly affected by possible variations in the sfr occurring at ages older than @xmath325  yr and , in particular , the location of the peak would remain unchanged . on the other hand , differences are evident among the distributions relative to more massive ( @xmath326 ) carbon stars .",
    "hence , it follows that the high luminosity tail could reflect the details of the recent history of star formation , for ages comprised roughly within @xmath327 and @xmath328 yr .",
    "on the basis of the above considerations , let us now investigate whether it is possible to reproduce the observed cslf by only varying the adopted sfr , while keeping fixed all the other prescriptions .",
    "we start from the theoretical distributions which are found not to fit the observed constraints with our standard prescription for the sfr [ @xmath329 , top panel of fig .",

    ".  [ cstar3 ] , we can already conclude that the discrepancy can not be removed , i.e.  there is no way to shift the theoretical peak towards lower luminosities .",
    "in fact , as previously discussed , the faintest possible location of the peak is characteristic of all simple distributions of carbon stars with initial masses @xmath331 , corresponding to ages older than @xmath325  yr .",
    "this circumstance makes the lower limit of the peak luminosity almost invariant to any changes in the sfr over this age interval .",
    "we can then conclude that _ the luminosity location of the peak is indeed a strong calibrator of the efficiency parameter @xmath3_.    moreover , considering that the extension of the faint tail of the distribution , from the peak down to the end , is essentially controlled by the occurrence of the low - luminosity dip ( see sect .",
    "[ dip ] ) , it follows that it not possible to populate the observed faintest bins , except by invoking a larger extension of the subluminous stage ( e.g.  @xmath332  mag ) than assumed here ( @xmath302  mag ) .",
    "let us now analyse the ( @xmath7 , @xmath10 ) case , illustrated in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ cstar3 ] .",
    "we aim at testing whether it is possible to calibrate a suitable law for the sfr , which is able to make the theoretical peak coincide with the observed one and to attain a general agreement of the overall features .",

    "[ sfr3 ] [ @xmath334 .",
    "the suitable value for the time - scale parameter is @xmath335  gyr , producing quite a slow decline of the sfr towards younger ages .",

    "this favours the contribution from carbon stars belonging to relatively young stellar generations ( @xmath338 ) , so that the peak of the theoretical distribution is moved into the right luminosity bin .",
    "however , it is worth noticing that , although the overall luminosity range fits the observed one , an excess of luminous carbon stars ( @xmath339 ) is predicted . to get a quantitative estimate of corresponding error we also plot in fig .",

    "the mismatch is really significant .",
    "finally , let us consider the @xmath344 , @xmath345 case , shown in the bottom panel of fig .",

    "if younger ages are assigned to @xmath348 , a slight excess of luminous carbon stars would show up . in this case , the discrepancy may be removed invoking , instead of a recent sharp decrease in the sfr , a more efficient envelope burning , or stronger mass - loss rates in massive tp - agb stars . in this respect , it is worth noticing the high luminosity bins of the distribution are crucially affected by the delicate interplay between convective dredge - up , envelope burning , and mass - loss occurring in massive tp - agb stars .",
    "unfortunately , the present understanding of all these topics is incomplete so that theoretical predictions suffer from a degree of uncertainty .",

    "it is remarkable that the present formulation for the third dredge - up allows a good fitting of the cslfs of both clouds without any dramatic change in the input parameters . in this context , _ the large difference between the cslfs in the lmc and smc are interpreted mainly as the result of a different metallicity_. the different histories of sfr in both galaxies probably play only a minor role in their cslfs .",
    "in this paper we describe an improved treatment of dredge - up in synthetic tp - agb models , based on the adoption of the parameter @xmath1 , i.e.  the minimum base temperature required for dredge - up to occur . every time a thermal pulse is expected during calculations , envelope integrations",
    "are performed to check whether the condition on the base temperature is satisfied .",
    "it follows that , contrary to the test based on the constant @xmath2 parameter , with this new scheme the response depends not only on the core mass but also on the current physical conditions of the envelope ( i.e.  the surface luminosity peak , the effective temperature , the mass , the chemical composition ) .",
    "moreover , this method allows one to determine not only the onset , but also the possible shut - down of dredge - up occurring when the envelope mass is significantly reduced by stellar winds , without invoking further a priori assumptions .",
    "this aspect is crucial .",
    "in fact , after the shut - down of the third dredge - up , surface and wind abundances of low - mass agb stars are expected to freeze out till the end of the evolution , with important consequences for the chemical composition of planetary nebulae , which are ejected during the last evolutionary stages .",
    "another point concerns the competition between envelope burning and dredge - up in the most massive tp - agb stars .",
    "in particular , if the shut - down of dredge - up occurs after envelope burning extinguishes , a star might undergo a late conversion to carbon star .",
    "the recent detection of a luminous ( @xmath352 ) dust - enshrouded carbon star in the lmc ( van loon et al .",
    "1998 ) seems to indicate such eventuality .",
    "this topic is the subject of a future study .",
    "the cslfs in the magellanic clouds are investigated as possible calibrators of the dredge - up parameters , and possible indicators of the sfr history in the host galaxies .",
    "we briefly summarise here the basic points emerging from our analysis :    * in principle , the observed cslfs can provide indications on the sfr history within the age interval from about @xmath364 yr to @xmath365 yr .",
    "nothing can be inferred for younger ages . * the faint end of the luminosity distribution",
    "is essentially determined by the temperature parameter @xmath1 . *",
    "the peak location depends only weakly on the sfr , and hence it is a stringent calibrator of the efficiency parameter @xmath3 . *",
    "although the peak location is essentially invariant with respect to the sfr , the shape of the carbon star distribution may give hints on the history of the sfr in recent epochs ( for ages between @xmath366 and @xmath328  yr ago ) .",
    "however , the bright wing is expected to be sensitive to the details of physical processes occurring in the most massive stars , i.e.  envelope burning and mass loss . *",
    "the best fit to the observed cslf in the lmc is obtained with @xmath6 , @xmath367 , and a constant sfr up to an age of about @xmath8 yr .",
    "this recent drop of the sfr is invoked to remove a slight excess of bright carbon stars otherwise predicted .",
    "* the best fit to the observed cslf in the smc is derived with @xmath10 , @xmath367 , and a constant sfr over the entire significant age interval . * if compared with the calibration for the lmc , a greater efficiency of dredge - up is required to reproduce the fainter peak of the cslf in the smc .",

    "we thank achim weiss for carefully reading the manuscript and for his useful comments .",
