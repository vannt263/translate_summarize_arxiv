    "the contacts between metals and semiconductors ( m / s ) play an important role in many practical electronic devices with far reaching applications . a controlled tuning of contact properties  @xcite , that is of technological relevance , relies on the fundamental understanding of the underlying physics and material properties .",
    "recent progress in planar gaas schottky barrier diodes , primarily developed for the x - ray detection applications , stimulated interest in the low work function m / s contacts , since the diodes possessing them revealed unexpectedly and favorably low leakage current  @xcite .",
    "further improvement of these devices with a promising application potential in sensorics , @xmath0/x - ray detection and medical imaging  @xcite , relies on the properties of the interfaces between the reactive low work function metal layers and surface passivisation metals . in one of the most striking cases",

    "since the xps analysis of the formed contact suggests a presence of a non - ideal disordered aumg alloy  @xcite with the changing composition instead of distinct au / mg phases , the question remains to be answered : what is the work function of the alloy right at the alloy / gaas interface ?",

    "i.e. they always lie below the average of au and mg work functions , and mostly close to the mg one , in agreement with the experimental observations .",
    "we find , that this trend is caused by the surface dipole formation due to the charge transfer from mg to au .",
