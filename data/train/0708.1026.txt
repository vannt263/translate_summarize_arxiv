    "supernova ( sn ) 2001gd was discovered at magnitude 16.5 on 2001 november 24.820 ut by @xcite , located @xmath2 north - northwest of the center of ngc  5033 .",
    "@xcite report a position of @xmath3 , @xmath4 ( j2000 ) , for the sn and note that nothing was detected at this position in previous ccd images taken 179 days earlier ( 2001 may 29 ) to a limiting magnitude of 19 .",
    "ten days later , @xcite obtained a spectrum of the sn , identifying it as a type iib sn well past its maximum light , with weak helium lines and nebular - phase lines of magnesium , oxygen , and calcium beginning to dominate .",
    "they noted that this spectrum was nearly identical to that of type iib sn  1993j , on day 93 after its explosion . using this suggestion to constrain the explosion date for the sn",
    ", we assume that the optical discovery occured @xmath5 days after the explosion and , therefore , for calculating the age of the supernova we assume an explosion date of 2001 september 03 , which is the same explosion date assumed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite gives the distance to ngc  5033 , as @xmath6 mpc ( calculated with @xmath7 ) . accepting their distance calculation and correcting it with an updated value of the hubble constant @xmath8",
    "gives a distance to the sn of @xmath9 .",
    "we note , however , that ngc  5033 is the host of several historical supernovae , including the radio emitting sn 1985l @xcite .",
    "if we follow @xcite and estimate the @xcite distance with hubble constant @xmath10 , we obtain a distance to ngc  5033 of @xmath11 .",
    "since a change in the distance estimate of @xmath12 will not significantly affect any of our estimates of the sn physical properties , we will , for consistency with the previous radio work , use in this paper the van dyk distance of 20 mpc .",
    "however , it should be noted that @xcite assumed a much shorter distance of 13.1 mpc .",
    "sn 2001gd was first detected at radio wavelengths on 2002 february 8.54 by @xcite , using the very large array ( vla ) at 1.3 cm ( 22.4 ghz ) , 3.6 cm ( 8.4 ghz ) , 6 cm ( 4.9 ghz ) , and 20 cm ( 1.5 ghz ) .",
    "they report a radio position of @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( j2000 ) with uncertainties of @xmath15 in each coordinate , which agrees with the reported optical position of @xcite to within the errors .",
    "@xcite presented the results of initial radio monitoring of sn 2001gd between 2002 february 8 and 2002 october 28 .",
    "their results showed that the radio emission evolves very smoothly , consistent with the nonthermal - emitting , thermal - absorbing model described by @xcite .",
    "their results also indicate a csm with significant structure embedded in a uniform medium , similar to that proposed for type iib sn 1993j @xcite .",
    "the similar optical spectra and early radio evolution of both sn 1993j and sn 2001gd indicate that the two type iib sne may have a number of similarities .",
    "@xcite conducted vlbi observations of sn 2001gd at 3.6 cm ( 8.4 ghz ) on 2002 june 26 and 2003 april 8 .",
    "although they were unable to resolve any structure in the sn , they were able to estimate the sn angular size through interferometer visibility fitting and found that their data suggested a possible deceleration in the expansion ( although their data were not conclusive ) .",
    "using our assumed distance of 20 mpc to the host galaxy , and the angular size limits estimated by @xcite , the upper limit to the expansion velocity of the blastwave is @xmath16 km  s@xmath17  for the 2002 june 26 vlbi observation ( day 296 ) .",
    "depending on the exact nature of the emitting region , the upper limit may be as low as @xmath18 km  s@xmath17 .",
    "thus , for the purposes of this paper , and for comparison with sn  1993j , we assume an expansion velocity of 15,000 km  s@xmath17 .    @xcite conducted multifrequency radio observations with the vla on 2003 april 8 to complement their vlbi data , obtaining a spectrum consistent with synchrotron emission partially suppressed by free - free absorption .",
    "they also obtained x - ray data on sn 2001gd from xmm - newton observations of ngc5033 on 2001 july 2 and 2002 december 18 and report the detection of x - ray emission on the latter date consistent with the expected reverse shock emission from typical type ii sne .",
    "recent vla observations indicate a dramatic change in the evolution of the radio emission from sn  2001gd .",
    "these new observations and their implications are presented in this paper .",
    "new radio observations of sn 2001gd have been made with the vla at 1.3 cm ( 22.4 ghz ) , 2 cm ( 14.9 ghz ) , 3.6 cm ( 8.4 ghz ) , 6 cm ( 4.9 ghz ) , and 20 cm ( 1.5 ghz ) , with one upper limit at 90 cm ( 0.3 ghz ) from 2002 november 08 through 2006 september 25 and are presented in table  [ tab1 ] and figure  [ fig1 ] . for completeness and ease of reference ,",
    "we include the previously published results from @xcite , and @xcite , as well as one measurement from the gmrt @xcite , in both table  [ tab1 ] and figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the techniques of observation , editing , calibration , and error estimation are described in previous publications on the radio emission from sne ( see , _",
    "e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we used 3c286 as the primary calibrator for flux density bootstrapping , while j1310 + 323 , with a defined position of @xmath19 , @xmath20 served as the phase calibrator and secondary flux density calibrator .",
    "the flux densities of j1310 + 323 are shown in table  [ tab2 ] and plotted in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "like most phase calibrators , j1310 + 323 shows some variation in its flux density because phase calibrators are selected for their proximity to the sn and unresolvable angular size rather than their flux stability .",
    "the primary calibrator is therefore used to determine the absolute flux density of the secondary calibrator at each epoch of the observations .",
    "the listed flux density measurement errors are determined based on both the intrinsic rms background noise level of the particular radio map , and a fractional error , @xmath21 , proportional to the sn flux .",
    "the rms map noise results from both small unresolved fluctuations in the background emission and random map fluctuations due to receiver noise , while the fractional error , @xmath21 , accounts for the inaccuracy of vla flux density calibration ( see , _",
    "e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and possible deviations of the primary calibrator from an absolute flux density scale .",
    "the final errors ( @xmath22 ) given for the measurements of sn 2001gd are taken as the addition in quadrature of these components :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the measured flux density , @xmath25 is the map rms background noise for each observation , and @xmath26 for 90 cm , @xmath27 for 20 cm , @xmath28 for 6 cm and 3.6 cm , @xmath29 for 2 cm , and @xmath27 for 1.3 cm .",
    "from the most recent rsn modeling discussion of @xcite and @xcite , we use a parameterized model :    @xmath30    with    @xmath31    where    @xmath32    @xmath33    and    @xmath34    with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 determined from fits to the data and corresponding to the flux density ( @xmath35 ) , homogeneous ( @xmath36 , @xmath38 ) , and clumpy or filamentary ( @xmath37 ) free - free absorption ( ffa ) at 5  ghz , formally but not necessarily physically , one day after the explosion date @xmath39 . for a more detailed explanation of the physical meaning of the parameters , the reader should consult the references cited above .",
    "since it is physically realistic and may be needed in some rsne where radio observations have been obtained at early times and high frequencies , equation ( [ eq2 ] ) also includes the possibility for an internal absorption term .",
    "this internal absorption ( @xmath40 ) term may consist of two parts  synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ; @xmath41 ) , and mixed , thermal ffa / non - thermal emission ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "@xmath43    @xmath44    @xmath45    with @xmath46 corresponding to the internal , non - thermal ( @xmath47 ) ssa and @xmath48 corresponding to the internal thermal ( @xmath49 ) free - free absorption mixed with non - thermal emission , at 5  ghz , formally but not necessarily physically , one day after the explosion date @xmath39 .",
    "the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 describe the time dependence of the optical depths for the ssa and ffa internal absorption components , respectively .",
    "application of this basic parameterization has been shown to be effective in describing the physical characteristics of the presupernova system , its csm , and its final stages of evolution before explosion for objects ranging from the two decades of monitoring the complex radio emission from sn 1979c @xcite through the unusual sn 1998bw ( grb980425 ) @xcite to the very well studied sn  1993j @xcite .",
    "the multi - frequency radio data for sn 2001gd are listed in table  [ tab1 ] and displayed in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "examination of the data indicates that radio evolution of the sn is best described by two distinct time intervals : an  early \" interval before day @xmath1 and a  late \" interval thereafter .",
    "although the precise date of the observed  break \" is not well defined , it appears that around the time of the observations of @xcite on 2003 april 8 ( day 582 ) the rate of flux decline markedly steepened such that the data can no longer be adequately described by the model appropriate for earlier times . similar ",
    "breaks \" have been observed in the radio light curves of other rsne , including sn  1988z @xcite , sn 1980k @xcite , and sn  1993j @xcite .",
    "an extensive search for the best parameter fits to equations ( [ eq2])-([eq10 ] ) was carried out on the `` early '' interval ( day @xmath52 ) by minimizing the reduced @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "since there are only four radio detections after the measurements on day 582 , the `` late '' radio light curve behavior is very poorly defined except to note that the few detections and the several upper limits indicate that the decline rate has significantly steepened and , following the example of sn  1993j @xcite , are consistent with an exponential decline with an e - folding time of 500 days .",
    "the early epoch fitting parameters are consistent with a homogeneous ( @xmath36 ) csm , although more complex structures such a csm containing filamentary ( @xmath37 ) components can not be ruled out .",
    "no evidence is seen for any distant , homogeneous thermal absorption ( @xmath55 ) , and the very early data ( @xmath56 days ) are too sparse to determine from the fitting if ssa ( @xmath46 ) , or mixed , internal , free - free absorption / nonthermal emission ( @xmath48 ) may have been present .",
    "however , we have estimated the brightness temperatures for the `` early '' ( before day @xmath1 ) 20  cm emission based on a pure ffa model and found that they exceed the limiting temperature for synchrotron emission of @xmath57 k calculated by @xcite , which was also the case for sn  1993j @xcite . given our inability to model this early absorption based purely on our sparse `` early '' data , we have chosen to assume that sn  2001gd has a similar brightness temperature evolution ( @xmath58 k at peak ) for the 20  cm emission as it becomes optically thin .",
    "given that sn  2001gd and sn  1993j have similar characteristics at `` early '' times , we estimate , as was the case for sn  1993j , that a significant ssa component is required for sn  2001gd along with the ffa component determined from fitting which describes the rapid rise of the 20  cm data well . the best parameters which we can estimate for the `` early '' epoch of sn  2001gd with these assumptions are given in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "we note an apparent similarity between the @xmath59 and @xmath60 terms from our modeling of the sn  2001gd radio emission .",
    "this is similar to the case of sn  1993j where the two values were @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "however , it must be stated that , from pure modeling , our sparse `` early '' data only constrain the values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 for sn  2001gd to lie between @xmath63 and @xmath64 . to narrow the range of these values ,",
    "we have therefore assumed a value of @xmath65 to match the value for @xmath59 determined for sn  1993j @xcite .",
    "the `` late '' period appears to be optically thin at all observed frequencies with a much steeper decline rate than is possible with the `` early '' data determined @xmath66 ( shown as the dashed line in figure  [ fig1 ] ) . again , if we assume a similarity to the exponential decline seen for sn  1993j @xcite , the late epoch of sn  2001gd is consistent with an exponential decline after day 550 , with an e - folding time of 500 days .",
    "this observed  break \" in the radio light curves of sn  2001gd is interpreted as indicative of a rapid transition of the blastwave into a much more tenuous medium .",
    "this occurs much earlier for sn  2001gd ( day @xmath1 ) than that seen for sn  1993j ( day @xmath67 ) by @xcite .",
    "before the break , sn  2001gd is still somewhat optically thick at 20  cm , but after the break it appears to be optically thin .",
    "this discounts the possibility of the break being the result of a sudden change in the shock velocity or magnetic field properties at the shock front since such changes would not yield an optical depth reduction .",
    "given the similar expansion velocities of @xmath18 km  s@xmath17  for sn  2001gd ( derived from @xcite ; see the introduction ) and @xmath68 km  s@xmath17  for sn  1993j @xcite , it is clear that both supernovae had a period of enhanced mass - loss rate preceding their explosions .",
    "thus , assuming a blastwave velocity for sn  2001gd of @xmath69 km  s@xmath17  and a `` standard '' pre - explosion wind velocity of 10 km  s@xmath17 , this enhanced mass - loss persisted for the @xmath70 years prior to the explosion .",
    "however in the case of sn  1993j , this phase began @xmath0 8,800 years earlier than the explosion of its progenitor star .",
    "the shorter duration of the high presupernova mass - loss rate for sn  2001gd is also borne out in its faster rise and higher luminosity , indicating there was less intervening , presupernova wind established , csm to contribute to the ffa at early epochs .      through use of this modeling",
    ", a number of physical properties of sne can be determined from the radio observations .",
    "one of these is the mass - loss rate from the sn progenitor prior to explosion . from the chevalier ( 1982a , b ) model , the turn - on of the radio emission for rsne provides a measure of the presupernova mass - loss rate to wind velocity ratio ( @xmath71 ) and",
    "@xcite derived this ratio for the case of pure , thermal , external absorption by a homogeneous medium .",
    "given the limited amount of early radio data available for sn 2001gd , there is no need to invoke more complex models than the simple , uniform , external thermal absorption model , so that @xmath72 and equation ( 16 ) of @xcite can be written :    @xmath73    here , the extra factor @xmath74 is a small correction that takes into account the fact that , for sn  2001gd , the csm density behaves like @xmath75 ( see below ) instead of @xmath76 as it would under the usual constant mass - loss rate assumption .",
    "the factor @xmath74 is given by the square root of the ratio of the integration constant for @xmath77 in the case of @xmath75 to the one appropriate for @xmath78 , i.e.    @xmath79    since sn 2001gd is a type iib supernova as sn 1993j was , and appears to be quite similar to it , we will adopt for sn 2001gd some of the same parameters as measured for sn 1993j .",
    "thus , for sn 2001gd we assume @xmath80 km  s@xmath17  at @xmath81 days , which is a value consistent with the results of @xcite as discussed earlier .",
    "we also adopt values of @xmath82 k , @xmath83 km  s@xmath17  ( which is appropriate for a rsg wind ) , @xmath84 days from our best fits to the radio data , and @xmath85 , as measured for sn 1993j by @xcite . with the assumptions for the blastwave and csm properties discussed above , and the results for the best - fit parameters listed in table [ tab3 ] ,",
    "our estimated presupernova mass - loss rate is @xmath86 yr@xmath17 at 8.6 years before explosion .",
    "the fitting parameter value of @xmath65 indicates that the csm density behaves like @xmath87 so that the mass - loss rate for sn 2001gd was not constant but was decreasing in the years leading up to the explosion , i.e. @xmath88 for a constant @xmath89 .",
    "since the shock speed for sn  2001gd is assumed to be @xmath90 km  s@xmath17at @xmath91 days , but variable with time ( @xmath92 for @xmath85 from @xcite ) , and the pre - supernova wind velocity for an rsg is typically @xmath93 km  s@xmath17 , we calculate that the abrupt decline in the radio light curves starting around day @xmath1 implies this change took place in the presupernova stellar wind @xmath70 years before explosion when the mass - loss rate was as high as @xmath94 yr@xmath17 . integrating the mass - loss rate over the last @xmath70 years before explosion , we find that , during that time , the progenitor star shed @xmath95 in a massive stellar wind . at earlier epochs of the progenitor s evolution",
    "the mass - loss rate was considerably lower , as indicated by the radio light curve `` break '' discussed above and the transition of the shock wave to a lower density csm at that time .",
    "figure 1 and table 3 show that the radio light curves for sn 2001gd can be described by standard rsn models @xcite during its `` early '' evolution up to day @xmath1 .",
    "after day @xmath1 the flux density decline rate clearly steepened to , in comparison with sn  1993j @xcite , a form consistent with an exponential decay with e - folding time of 500 days .",
    "the `` break '' in the radio light curves for sn 2001gd is interpreted as due to a change in the average csm density .",
    "similar `` breaks '' have been identified earlier in sn  1980k @xcite , sn  1988z @xcite , and sn  1993j @xcite .",
    "normal assumptions for presupernova stellar wind properties imply a dense wind with mass - loss rate decreasing for the last @xmath70 years before explosion from @xmath96 yr@xmath17 to @xmath97 yr@xmath17 around the time of explosion .",
    "the mass - loss rate was sharply lower for times earlier than @xmath70 years before explosion .",

    "<S> the radio emission exhibits a dramatically steeper decline rate which , assuming similarity to sn  1993j , can be described as an exponential decrease with an e - folding time of 500 days . we interpret this abrupt change in the radio flux density decline rate as implying a transition of the shock front into a more tenuous region of circumstellar material . </S>",
