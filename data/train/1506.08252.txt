    "the linear polarization observed in stars , in general , is very small . a polarization of 0.01 ( 1 per cent ) is considered to be quite large by the usual standards .",
    "it is essential that a high precision is achieved in polarimetry if the measurements of stellar polarization and attempts to detect any likely variation in it are to be meaningful . in principle , it is possible to attain a very high precision in polarimetry when compared to photometry since the former essentially uses the technique of differential photometry : we do not express the results in terms of the polarized flux , but in terms of the degree of polarization where the mean brightness of the star itself serves as the reference light level .",
    "this procedure eliminates to a large extent the adverse effects of atmospheric scintillation , seeing and transparency variation , the factors which usually limit the photometric accuracy . while achieving an external photometric consistency of 1 per cent",
    "is quite difficult even for bright objects , with suitable instrumentation and proper care it is possible to obtain an external consistency of 0.01 per cent in polarimetry , if sufficient photons are available .",
    "there are several physical mechanisms that produce polarization of light from astronomical objects ( serkowski 1974b ; scarrott 1991 ) .",
    "one of the most common processes that give rise to linear polarization of starlight involves circumstellar dust grains ; they produce a net polarization in starlight integrated over the stellar disc either by scattering in an asymmetric envelope or by selective dichroic extinction",
    ". measurements of polarization in multibands are required to study the nature of grains and their formation in the circumstellar environments .",
    "the observed polarization , in general , will contain a contribution from the interstellar dust grains , which could be quite significant in some cases . with reasonable assumptions about the interstellar component , it is possible to derive the intrinsic polarization exhibited by starlight if the wavelength dependence of the observed polarization is known .",
    "polarimetric observations of vega - like stars indicate that most of them show intrinsic polarization probably arising from scattering by dust grains confined to circumstellar discs ( bhatt & manoj 2000 ) . in order to improve the sample of such stars ,",
    " it is essential that the polarimeter should be able to measure polarizations which are extremely low ( @xmath3  0.1 per cent ) because the material that constitutes the circumstellar discs is expected to be very tenuous .",
    "the observations done at vainu bappu observatory during the past several years indicate that in some of the rv tauri stars circumstellar grains either condense , or get aligned cyclically during each pulsational cycle , possibly triggered by the periodic passage of atmospheric shocks ( raveendran 1999a ) . in order to look for a possible evolution in the grain size distribution , in case",
    "it is the dust condensation that occurs , multiband observations are absolutely essential .",
    "similarly , the identification of the polarigenic mechanism in t tauri objects , which again constitute another group of objects extensively studied at the institute ( mekkaden 1998 , 1999 ) , also requires a knowledge of the wavelength dependence of polarization .",
    "some of the other polarimetrically interesting objects that are studied in the institute using multi - spectral band data are herbig ae / be stars ( ashok et al . 1999 ) , luminous blue variables ( parthasarathy , jain & bhatt 2000 ) , young stellar objects ( manoj , maheswar , & bhatt 2002 ) and r crb stars ( kameswara rao & raveendran 1993 ) .",
    "there was a need for an efficient photo - polarimeter for observations with the 1-m carl zeiss telescope at vainu bappu observatory , kavalur .",
    "sky chopping polarimeter , which was built by jain & srinivasulu ( 1991 ) almost a quarter century ago , was the only available instrument for polarimetric studies at the observatory for several ongoing programmes .",
    "it is a very inefficient instrument .",
    "it uses a rotating hnpb sheet as the analyzer and observations can be done only in one spectral band at a time .",
    "further , the time spent on sky observations is always the same as that spent on star observations , irrespective of the relative brightnesses of the star and the sky background , and thus underutilizing the available telescope time .",
    "a project to build a new photo - polarimeter for observations of point sources in @xmath4 bands with the 1-m telescope was initiated in the indian institute of astrophysics quite sometime back .",
    "unfortunately , due to unforeseen reasons there were delays at various stages of the execution of the project .",
    "in this write - up we give the details of the three band , two beam photo - polarimeter for point sources that we designed and built in the institute . in section  [ s : worpri ]",
    "we give the working principle of the instrument . the optical layout , and the functions and details of important components",
    "are described in section  [ s : instr ] .",
    "several factors that have gone into the selection of the optical elements and the design of the various mechanical parts are briefly described in that section .",
    "the responses of the dichroic mirrors and the glass filters supplied by the manufacturer , and the mean wavelengths of the @xmath4 passbands of the polarimeter computed from the responses of the various components including the detector are also presented in the same section .",
    "a brief description of the polarized light in terms of the stokes parameters and the effects of polarizer and retarders on these parameters when introduced in the light path are presented in the next section .    in section  [ s : linpol ] we describe the various schemes of determination of linear polarization included in the reduction program , and discuss how the available time should be optimally distributed between the observations of object and background brightness in order to minimize the error in the linear polarization .",
    "a brief description of the electronics system that controls the polarimeter operations and data acquisition are given in section  [ s : conele ] .",
    "the data reduction and display program is briefly described in section  [ s : datacq ] .",
    "the polarimeter was mounted onto the 1-m carl zeiss telescope at kavalur and observations of several polarized and unpolarized stars were made during 14  april30  may  2014 to evaluate its performance .",
    "due to prevalent poor sky conditions , the instrument could be used effectively only on a few nights during this period .",
    "the instrument was found to have a very high degree of mechanical stability , but a comparatively low polarization efficiency of 94.72% . in order to reduce the scattered light inside the instrument",
    ", we blackened the few internal mechanical parts that were left out earlier and improved light shields , and again made observations during february  april  2015 ; in section  [ s : obsres ] we present a detailed analysis of these observations and the results obtained .",
    "the working principle of the polarimeter is illustrated in figure  [ f : worpri ] .",
    "an astronomical polarimeter based on this principle was first built by piirola ( 1973 ) .",
    "a beam displacement prism divides the incident light into two beams with mutually perpendicular planes of polarization .",
    "the ordinary - beam , with the plane of polarization perpendicular to the plane containing the optical axis and the incident beam , obeys the snell s law of refraction at the prism surface and travels along the initial ray direction .",
    "the extraordinary - beam with vibrations lying in the    above plane does not obey snell s law , and hence , travels in the prism with a speed that varies with the direction . as a result of these ,",
    "the incident light beam will emerge from the prism as two spatially separated beams .",
    "the background sky , which acts as an extended object , illuminates the entire top surface of the beam displacement prism , and hence , produces two broad emergent beams whose centres are spatially separated by the same amount as above .",
    "there will be a considerable overlap between these two beams about the geometrical axis of the prism , and wherever the beams overlap in the focal plane of the telescope that portion remains unpolarized by the prism and observations give the background sky brightness directly .",
    "the situation is different with respect to the starlight ; the star being a point source , there will be no overlap between the two emergent beams from the prism .",
    "the net result of these two effects is that we observe two images of the star with mutually perpendicular planes of polarization at the focal plane superposed on the unpolarized background sky .",
    "two identical apertures are used to isolate these images , and a rotating chopper is used to alternately block one of the images allowing the other to be detected by the same photomultiplier tube .",
    "the main advantages of such an arrangement are : ( i ) the contribution of background sky polarization is completely eliminated from the data , thereby , facilitating the observations of fainter stars during moonlit nights without compromising on the accuracy that is achievable during dark nights .",
    "this is possible because the background sky is not modulated , it just appears as a constant term that can be removed from the data accurately .",
    "( ii ) since the same photomultiplier tube is used to detect both the beams , the effect of any time - dependent variations in its sensitivity as a result of variations in the associated electronics , like , high voltage supply , is negligible .",
    "( iii ) the quasi - simultaneous detection of both the beams using a fast rotating chopper essentially eliminates the effects of variations in sky - transparency and reduces the errors due to atmospheric scintillation for bright stars significantly .",
    "scintillation noise is independent of the brightness of the star and dominates the photon noise for bright objects ; with a 1-m telescope the low frequency ( @xmath3 50  hz ) scintillation noise is expected to be larger than the photon noise for stars brighter than b  @xmath5  7.0  mag at an airmass 1.0 ( young 1967 ) .",
    "the averaging of the data by the process of long integration will reduce the scintillation noise only to a certain extent because of its log - normal distribution .",
    "the frequency spectrum of scintillation noise is flat up to about 50  hz ; the noise amplitude decreases rapidly above this frequency and it becomes negligibly small above 250  hz . with the fast chopping of the beams and automatic removal of the background sky polarization it is possible to make polarization measurements that are essentially photon - noise limited .",
    "the two factors that determine the overall efficiency of a polarimeter attached to a telescope are : ( i ) the faintest magnitude that could be reached with a specified accuracy in a given time , and ( ii ) the maximum amount of information on wavelength dependence that could be obtained during the same time .",
    "it is evident that the former depends on the efficiency in the utilization of photons collected by the telescope and the latter on the number of spectral bands that are simultaneously available for observation . in the beam displacement prism - based polarimeters , where the image separation is small ,",
    "the intensities of the two beams produced by the analyzer are measured alternately using the same detector , and hence , only 50 per cent of the light collected by the telescope is effectively utilized . in polarimeters using wollaston prism as the analyzer , the two beams , which are well - separated without any overlap , can be detected simultaneously by two independent photomultiplier tubes , fully utilizing the light collected ( magalhaes , benedetti & roland  1984 ; deshpande et al .",
    "1985 ) . for simultaneous multi - spectral band observations that make use of the incident light",
    "fully , the beams emerging from the analyzer will have to be well - separated so as to accommodate a large number of photomultiplier tubes , making the resulting instrument both heavy and large in size ( serkowski , mathewson & ford 1975 ) , and hence , not suitable for the 1-m telescope .",
    "usually , in wollaston and foster prism - based polarimeters , when multispectral bands are available simultaneously , different spectral bands are distributed among the two emergent beams and at a time only 50 per cent of the light collected in each spectral region is made use of ( kikuchi 1988 ; hough , peacock & bailey 1991 ) .",
    "separate observations are needed to remove the background sky polarization when there is no overlap between the emergent beams , and a significant fraction of the time spent on object integration will have to be spent for such observations if the objects are faint . in beam displacement prism based polarimeters , time has to be spent only to determine the brightness of the background sky , and for the maximum signal - to - noise ratio it is only a negligible fraction of the object integration time even for relatively faint objects ; the available time for observation can be almost entirely utilized to observe the object .",
    "therefore , the non - utilization of 50 per cent light in beam displacement prism based polarimeters does not effectively reduce their efficiency , especially , while observing faint objects where the photons lost actually matter .",
    "the provisions for multi - spectral band observations can be easily incorporated in the design , making beam displacement prism based polarimeters to have an overall efficiency significantly higher than that of the usual wollaston or foster prism based polarimeters ( magalhaes , benedetti & roland  1984 ; deshpande et al .",
    "1985 ; hough , peacock & bailey 1991 ) .",
    "another advantage of these polarimeters is that they can be easily converted into conventional photometers , just by pulling the beam displacement prism out of the light path .",
    "we adopted a design based on the beam displacement prism for the polarimeter because with such an instrument polarimetry can be done without compromising much on the precision even under moderate variations in background sky brightness and atmospheric transparency .",
    "the brightness in the blue spectral band , when the sky is dark , is about 15  mag , typically , if a focal plane diaphragm of 20 @xmath6 diameter is used for observation .",
    "the background brightness continuously increases for a few hours after moon - rise and decreases for a few hours before moon - set .",
    "even when the moon is high up in the sky the background brightness can change appreciably during the observation if the object integration lasts several minutes .",
    "large changes in the background brightness can also occur if the sky is partially cloudy and moonlit . when wollaston prism - based polarimeters are used an exact removal of the background polarization , which could be several tens of percentage ,",
    "is extremely difficult .",
    "sometimes , it may be even impossible to remove the background polarized flux accurately , if large changes occur in it .",
    "these instruments are effective in observing faint objects during dark periods of nights .",
    "but , with a beam displacement prism - based polarimeter reliable results can be obtained during fairly bright moonlit periods even when the sky is partially cloudy .",
    "in fact , most of the spectroscopic nights can be utilized for polarimetric observations with such an instrument . in the present polarimeter observations",
    "can be made simultaneously in three spectral bands .",
    "more sophisticated versions of the beam displacement prism are available elsewhere ( magalhaes & velloso 1988 ; scaltriti et al .",
    "1989 ; schwarz & piirola 1999 ) .",
    "the layout of the polarimeter indicating the positions of the main components is shown schematically in figure  [ f : schelay ] .",
    "the front and side views of the polarimeter are schematically shown in figures  [ f : frontview ] and [ f : sideview ] , indicating the important components . in the following subsections",
    "we describe the various components and the details which have gone into either their design , or their selection .",
    "the instrument was designed basically for use at the 1-m carl zeiss telescope of vainu bappu observatory , as mentioned earlier ; in principle , it can be used with any telescope having an f/13 beam with suitable modifications in the sizes of the twin diaphragms .",
    "the first element in the polarimeter is the wide angle viewing arrangement for object field identification .",
    "the star field is brought into the field of view of the eyepiece by flipping a plane mirror to a 45-degree position with respect to the telescope axis .",
    "the costs of the optical elements , like , half - wave plate and beam displacement prism , go up drastically with increase in their clear apertures .",
    "the glan prism , which is used to calibrate the instrument for 100 per cent polarization , has a constant aperture - to - thickness ratio , and hence , larger the aperture , larger is its thickness . since no re - imaging is done the diameter of the light beam produced by the telescope increases linearly with distance on either side of the image - isolating , focal plane diaphragms . in order to keep their clear apertures as small as possible ,",
    "all the optical elements should be kept as close to the diaphragm as possible .",
    "the minimum distance between the centre of the wide angle mirror and the diaphragm , which could be accomplished , is 195  @xmath7 . at this distance",
    "the diameter of the f/13 beam is 15  @xmath7 . assuming a field - stop of 50  @xmath7 for a 2-@xmath8 barrel eyepiece ( the maximum field - stop possible for such an eyepiece is 46  @xmath7 )",
    "the minimum width of the mirror should be 65  @xmath7 and its length should be 92  @xmath7 . since the mirror is introduced in a converging beam rather than a parallel beam , the centre of the mirror should be offset by about 1.5  @xmath7 , along the length of the mirror towards the side closer to the telescope back - end .",
    "we have used a 70  @xmath7 @xmath9 100  @xmath7 mirror . because it is slightly oversized the mirror need not be offset to accommodate all the light collected by the telescope over the field .",
    "the flat mirror blank is made of borosilicate crown and an overcoating of silicon monoxide is given to protect the reflective aluminium coating for longer life .",
    "for the object identification a field of view of about 10 @xmath10 diameter is needed ; this requires eyepieces of fairly long focal lengths with large field stops .",
    "several makes of eyepieces with focal lengths around 50  @xmath7 are available in the market .",
    "gordon ( 1988 ) , who made a comparative study of the performance of these eyepieces , has reported that the 4-element super plossl eyepiece of 56  @xmath7 focal length made by meade has the best overall performance .",
    "the exit pupil , the image of the primary formed by the eyepiece , has a size of 4.3  @xmath7 .",
    "the eye - relief , which is the distance between the last physical element of the eyepiece and the exit pupil , is excellent ( @xmath11  38  @xmath7 ) .",
    "the eyepiece , like other makes of similar focal lengths , is not parfocal with other eyepieces , and hence , refocusing is needed if the eyepiece has to be replaced with another one of a different focal length .",
    "it has the largest apparent field of 52 degree among the eyepieces investigated by gordon , and since a larger apparent field implies a higher magnification it also has the highest magnification .",
    "the apparent field of an eyepiece is the angle subtended at the eye by the circular patch that appears to the eye when viewed through it .",
    "the outer boundary is defined by the field stop , a metal ring that gives a sharp boundary by restricting the observer from seeing too far off axis , where the quality of star images becomes poor .",
    "the diameter of the field stop is approximately 46  @xmath7 . with an image scale of 15.5 @xmath6 per @xmath7 at the focal plane of the 1-m telescope",
    "the true field that can be viewed is about 12 @xmath10 , which is fairly good for object identification .",
    "the axis of the field - viewing eyepiece is 100  @xmath7 from the top of the mounting flange . with the position angle device , which has a thickness of 50  @xmath7",
    ", there is sufficient clearance between the observer s head and the back - end of the telescope , making the wide angle viewing convenient .      because of the diffraction phenomenon occurring at its aperture",
    "the starlight collected by a telescope will be distributed spatially in the image plane with the intensity falling off asymptotically as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the radial distance from the central axis .",
    "the reflector telescopes usually have a central obscuration , and for a typical ritchie - chretien telescope it is about 40 per cent of the full aperture .",
    "figure  [ f : exclint ] shows the intensity distribution due to diffraction effects at the focal plane of a 1-m telescope with and without the central obscuration .",
    "it also shows the energy excluded as a function of the diaphragm radius for both the cases .",
    "the main effect of the central obscuration is the redistribution of intensity in the outer rings , and thereby , spreading out farther the light collected by the telescope .",
    "it is clear from the figure that even with an aperture of 16-@xmath6 diameter at the focal plane of a 1-m cassegrain telescope the excluded energy is more than 0.5 per cent .",
    "if the aperture is not exactly at the focal plane the excluded energy will be significantly larger than the above ( young 1970 ) .",
    "the actual measurements of light lost in the focal plane diaphragm by kron & gordon ( 1958 ) show that the excluded energy can be several times larger than that indicated in figure  [ f : exclint ] , where only the effects due to the classical diffraction phenomenon are included .",
    "the increase in excluded energy in practice arises from the extended rings of the star image primarily caused by the surface roughness of the telescope mirrors or the presence of dust on them ( kormendy 1973 ; young et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "if the star trails inside the diaphragm due to a poor tracking of the telescope , the included light will vary because the light thrown out on one side of the diaphragm will not be the same as that brought in on the other side of the diaphragm , thus , resulting in a variation in the output from the photomultiplier tube .",
    "the two images formed by the beam displacement prism passes through different regions of the various optical elements , like , filters .",
    "the transmittance of the glass filters and the reflectivity of the dichroic mirrors , in general , will not be the same across their surfaces ; a spatial drift in the images will cause a variation in the differential throughput of the beams .",
    "the accuracy in the polarimetric measurements primarily depends on the accuracy in the determination of the ratios of the intensities of the two beams over a full rotational cycle of the signal modulator .",
    "if the star images trail inside the diaphragms there will be additional modulations of the ratio of intensities of the two beams , contributing to the errors in the measurement . for precise polarimetry",
    "it is essential that the star image should not drift inside the diaphragm even by a minute fraction of its size while observation , emphasizing the importance of the availability of a proper guiding facility .",
    "accurate guiding is possible if the image scale available for guiding is similar to that used for observation , making offset guiding the best option .",
    "another plane mirror , which is also inclined at an angle of 45 degree to the telescope axis , is provided to reflect the starlight to the right side of the polarimeter for the purpose of guiding . using a separate mirror for a guide star",
    "ensures that the alignment of the wide angle viewing arrangement with respect to the diaphragm is not disturbed , and thereby , saving the trouble of re - aligning it every time either the instrument is mounted onto the telescope , or a new object is acquired for observation , and improving slightly the efficiency in the use of telescope time .",
    "the centre of the mirror is at a distance of 210  @xmath7 from the focal plane diaphragm .",
    "the width of the plane mirror used is 70  @xmath7 , which gives a projected cross - section of 50  @xmath7 , and its length is 120  @xmath7 .",
    "the unvignetted field of the 1-m telescope is 40 @xmath10 .",
    "the central clearance of the mounting flange of the polarimeter has a diameter of 168  @xmath7 , corresponding to a slightly smaller unvignetted field of 38 @xmath10 .",
    "the positioning of the rectangular mirror with respect to the telescope axis and the circular clearance of the mounting flange defines a field of 18 @xmath10 @xmath9 8 @xmath10 for choosing a guide star .",
    "a suitable x - y stage which can hold an intensified ccd is yet to be finalized .      in order to measure the degree of polarization of the incident light accurately",
    "it is essential that the instrument should not cause any depolarization ; it should have an efficiency of 100 per cent as a polarizer , because a good analyzer has to be a good polarizer .",
    "the polarization efficiency of the instrument should be frequently measured to look for any malfunctioning , and the availability of a provision for doing so at the telescope is highly desirable . a fully plane polarized beam that is necessary for this purpose",
    "can be obtained by inserting the glan - taylor prism in the path of the starlight .",
    "the prism is made of calcite , and its entrance and exit faces are normal to the direction of light path . its angle has been cut such that the o - ray is internally reflected and absorbed by the black mounting material within the prism housing .",
    "the two halves of the prism are separated by an airspace for greater ultraviolet transmission .",
    "the usable wavelength range of the prism is 300 to 2700  @xmath14 .",
    "the extinction ratio is less than @xmath15 for the undeviated ray .",
    "the polarization effect is maintained in a field of view of 13 to 7.5 degree , but it is symmetrical about the normal to the incident surface only at one wavelength .",
    "the symmetric field of view decreases with increase in wavelength ; at 1000  @xmath14 the full field of view is about 4.5 degree , and hence , the prism is suitable for an f/13 beam where the convergence angle is 4.4 degree .",
    "the clear aperture of the prism used is 24.5  @xmath7 and its length is 25  @xmath7 .",
    "the deviation of the extraordinary beam on emergence from its initial direction is less than 2 @xmath10 .",
    "the lateral shift caused in the image will be less than 15  @xmath16 , and a re - centring of the star image inside the diaphragm may not be necessary after the introduction of the prism in the light path . because of its fairly large length , when the prism is inserted in the light path a re - focusing of the image will be needed .",
    "the image plane will be shifted down by about 8.2-mm from its normal position when the prism is introduced . among the polarizing prisms that are usually employed ,",
    "glan - taylor prisms have the lowest length to aperture ratio ( @xmath2 0.85 ) .      the intensity of light at different position angles , which is needed for the determination of the degree of polarization , may be measured either by rotating the analyzer , or by rotating the entire instrument about the telescope axis .",
    "both the procedures are cumbersome and involve a large amount of overhead time at the expense of the actual observational time .",
    "the star image will have to be centred inside the diaphragm at each position of the instrument or the analyzer during the rotation as it is extremely difficult to align the axis of the instrument or the analyzer with the respective rotational axes .",
    "when the analyzer is rotated the plane of polarization of light incident on the photocathode changes . since the sensitivities of a cathode for different planes of polarization are not same , the rotation of the analyzer would either cause spurious polarization , or increase the error in the measured polarization unless a depolarizer efficient over the entire wavelength region of observation is inserted after the analyzer .",
    "these problems can be avoided if a rotating half - wave plate is introduced in the light path for modulating the starlight . if the half - wave plate is rotated by an angle @xmath17 , most of the disturbing instrumental effects , in particular , those caused by image motion on the photocathode will have modulations with @xmath17 and 2@xmath17 angles , while the linear polarization will have a modulation of 4@xmath17 .",
    "this effectively reduces the risk of spurious polarization caused by the image motion .",
    "however , there will be an increase in the error of measurement depending on the amplitudes of modulation with angles @xmath17 and 2@xmath17 .",
    "the retarder rotated should be extremely plane parallel and the rotational axis should be exactly aligned with the normal to its light - incident face .",
    "the modulating half - wave plate should be placed in front of the optical components which isolate spectral regions for observations because the latter usually polarize light ; it is ideal to have the half - wave plate as the first element in the optical path inside the polarimeter .",
    "a half - wave retarder made of a single plate will act as the same only at a particular wavelength and on either side of this the retardance continuously changes .",
    "if we have to cover a wide spectral range , the retardance should change as little as possible over the entire range .",
    "achromatic retarders are produced by combining two plates of different birefringent materials . for good achromatism",
    "the surfaces should be flat to @xmath18/10 and plane parallel to about 1 @xmath6 .",
    "the pair of magnesium fluoride and quartz provides a good combination and the retardance of an achromatic half - wave plate made out of these materials does not deviate more than 45 degree from 180 degree over the spectral range 3001000  @xmath14 .",
    "these materials are transparent over a wide spectral range and are hard , and hence , easy to polish with a high precision . a very high degree of achromatism , super - achromatism , over the above spectral range can be obtained by using a pancharatnam retarder which consists of three achromatic retarders , each made by a combination of quartz and magnesium fluoride and operating in a particular wavelength region .",
    "such a retarder was used for the first time in an astronomical polarimeter by frecker & serkowski ( 1976 ) .",
    "the achromatic retarders , which form the superachromatic combination , are cemented to each other .",
    "the calculated path difference for such a superachromatic half - wave plate is plotted in the top panel of figure  [ f : hwpret ] . in the spectral range 3101100  @xmath14 the path difference ( r )",
    "lies within @xmath191.3 per cent of @xmath18/2 , and during the manufacture it is possible to achieve the theoretical retardation to an accuracy of about @xmath193 per cent .",
    "the error introduced by this in the measurement of linear polarization will be almost non - existent ( see section  [ ss : rotmod ] ) .",
    "the main drawback of the pancharatnam retarders is the wavelength dependence of position angle of their effective optical axis as seen in the bottom panel of figure  [ f : hwpret ] . over the spectral region 310 to 1100  @xmath14 the orientation of the expected effective optical axis on the surface rotates by about @xmath192.5 degree ; the actual range could be slightly larger than the theoretical value .",
    "this would cause difficulties in the accurate determination of the position angle of polarization when broad spectral bands , as in the present case , are used for observations because corrections that are to be applied to the position angles would depend on the energy distribution of the observed objects .",
    "such an inconvenience can , fortunately , be avoided by introducing another stationary identical pancharatnam plate immediately in the light path .",
    "the introduction of such a half - wave plate ensures that the signal modulation is only a function of the relative positions of the effective optical axis of the two half - wave plates .",
    "the stationary half - wave plate is mounted with its effective optical axis approximately parallel to the principal plane of the analyzer , which in this case is the calcite block mounted just below this .",
    "this is to reduce the contributions to the modulation of intensity of transmitted light from terms that depend on the sine of position angle of optical axis .    for a birefringent material the reflection coefficient even for normal",
    "incidence depends on the position angle of the plane of vibration , and hence unpolarized light may become polarized after passing through a retarder . to reduce the polarization by refraction , the six plates of the superachromatic half - wave plates are cemented with cover plates made from fused silica suprasil , which is an isotropic material , and the outer surfaces are single - reflection coated .",
    "the two identical half - wave plates of 19-@xmath7 clear aperture used in the polarimeter are acquired from bernhard halle nachfl .",
    "gmbh , berlin , germany .",
    "the half - wave plate is rotated using a stepper motor of model no .",
    "mo61-fc02 , procured from superior electric .",
    "it makes one rotation in 400 half - steps , and is coupled to the halfwave plate through a 1:1 anti - backlash spur gear system .",
    "the role of the analyzer is performed by the calcite block introduced in the light path immediately after the stationary half - wave plate .",
    "the optical components , dichroic filters and diffraction grating , that are commonly used to isolate spectral regions in multichannel instruments change the state of polarization of the incident light , and hence , the analyzer should be placed in front of all such components .    as mentioned already the light beam splits into two at the incident surface of a beam - displacement prism .",
    "if the optical axis is parallel to the incident ray both beams travel with the same velocity inside the prism and if it is perpendicular they travel along the same direction with an ever increasing phase difference between them ; in both cases the emergent beams produce a single image . when the optical axis makes any other angle with the incident ray the two beams travel in different directions and produce two spatially separated beams on emerging from the crystal .",
    "the maximum separation between the emergent beams occurs when the optical axis is inclined at an angle of 45 degree with the incident beam . since the light beam is incident normal to its face",
    ", a beam displacement prism is cut with its optical axis making an angle of 45 degree with the incident face .",
    "the huygens wave front of the ordinary vibrations is spherical while that of the extraordinary vibrations is an ellipsoid of revolution about the optical axis , with the major axis inclined at an angle of 45 degree to the incident beam , and this causes the splitting of the incident beam .",
    "if @xmath20 is the deviation of the extraordinary beam from the ordinary beam then @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the refractive indices of the extraordinary and ordinary rays .",
    "if @xmath24 is the thickness of the prism , the separation @xmath25 of the two beams on emerging from it will be @xmath26 it is clear from the above two relations that the separation between the images depends on the difference in the refractive indices of the ordinary and extraordinary rays .",
    "of the commonly available crystals , quartz , magnesium fluoride , sapphire , calcite , kdp and lithium niobate , calcite has the largest difference between @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and hence , for a given thickness a calcite plate gives the largest separation between the beams .",
    "calcite is a negative crystal ; at @xmath18 = 589  @xmath14 , @xmath23 = 1.65835 , @xmath27 = @xmath280.17195 , and the deviation of the extraordinary beam from the ordinary beam , @xmath20 = 6.22 degree . since the difference in the refractive indices of the two beams is a function of wavelength , the spatial separation of the two beams",
    "also will be a function of wavelength .",
    "the separation as a function of wavelength expected for a calcite plate of 14  @xmath7 thickness is plotted in figure  [ f : imgsep ] ; the refractive indices needed for the computation are taken from levi ( 1980 ) .",
    "the introduction of the calcite plate in the converging beam will shift the focal plane away from it .",
    "if @xmath24 is the thickness and @xmath29 the refractive index , the shift produced in the focal plane is given by @xmath30 with @xmath24 = 28  @xmath7 , at @xmath18 = 589  @xmath14 , for the ordinary beam @xmath31 @xmath32 11  @xmath7 . because of the variations in the refractive index with wavelength even the ordinary image will show chromatic aberration .",
    "the extraordinary image will show astigmatism additionally because the corresponding beam propagates obliquely through the plate at an angle of about 6 degree with respect to the normal to the surface .",
    "the predominant aberrations shown by the image will be very similar in magnitude to those that would be produced by a beam of light passing through a glass plate at an angle same as above ( brand 1971 ) .",
    "consequently , the focal planes , planes containing the circle of least confusion , for the two beams will not be the same .",
    "further , as a result of the fresnel reflection losses from the surface being different for the two orthogonal planes of polarization the two beams will have slightly different intensities even for unpolarized objects .",
    "both these inconvenient features of a single calcite plate can be avoided if two cemented plane parallel plates with their principal planes crossed at right angles are used ( serkowski 1974a ) ; the light which is ordinary in the first plate becomes extraordinary , and vice versa in the second . hence",
    ", both the images of a star produced by a calcite block with two crossed plates will be affected similarly and the images will have circles of least confusion in the same plane .",
    "this will enable one to obtain the same degree of focus for both the images inside the corresponding apertures .",

    "the transmission of such a block over the spectral region 3001000  @xmath14 is close to 90 per cent ( mccarthy 1967 ) .",
    "the computed parameters of the images are given in table  [ t : parimg ] .",
    "the calcite block is mounted such that the line joining the centres of the images is parallel to the front side of the polarimeter .",
    "it can be removed from the light path , if needed , to use the instrument as a three channel photometer with or without the star - sky chopping facility .",
    "the maximum back focal length from the last mounting plate with the position angle device of the 1-m carl zeiss telescope at kavalur is 324@xmath34 .",
    "the diaphragms are placed at a distance of 295  @xmath7 from the top of the mounting flange of the polarimeter , which is well within the allowed range .",
    "the details of the diaphragms that are available are given in table  [ t : detaper ] .",
    "the disc on which these diaphragms are mounted is made to protrude slightly outside the instrument - body to facilitate its rotation manually for choosing the required set of twin diaphragms for observation .",
    "the centres of the twin diaphragms are aligned along the radial direction of the disc .",
    "they should always be accurately positioned at the same locations with respect to the axis of the instrument to avoid any change either in the angle of incidence on the photocathode or in the region of illumination on its surface by the two images . a possible light leak through the slot made on the side plate of the instrument",
    "is arrested by using a cap to the protruding portion .",
    "it is seen from from figure  [ f : exclint ] that the excluded energy is nearly flat beyond a radius of about 7 @xmath6 , and hence , with the 1.3-@xmath7 diaphragm , which corresponds to an angular diameter of 20 @xmath6 , the excluded light is less than 0.5 per cent .    the 1.3-@xmath7 single diaphragm is included for the purpose of using the instrument as a conventional photometer without star - sky chopping or as a polarimeter in single image mode . the 4.5-@xmath7 single diaphragm is included for the purpose of field - viewing to make centring of the images inside the smaller diaphragms for observation easy .",
    "it is highly desirable if the metal focal plane diaphragms that are used currently are replaced with those made of a non - metallic material .",
    "serkowski ( 1974a ) has reported that when the star image was on the edge of a metallic diaphragm such that only about half of the light entered the polarimeter a linear polarization over 0.2 per cent with the position angle parallel to the edge of the diaphragm was found .",
    "hence , if the star image drifts during the observation it could increase the errors in the polarization measurements significantly , if metallic apertures are used .",
    "the twin diaphragms need not be of equal sizes if the instrument is used only in the double image mode polarimetry because the sky intensity in each beam is observed and removed separately .",
    "but , it is better to have identical diaphragms if the instrument has to be used in the star - sky chopping photometric mode ; if they are of different sizes their relative sizes should be known exactly for the removal of the sky background .",

    "on inserting the numerical values of the constants , the above expression reduces to @xmath45 where @xmath37 is in @xmath46 , @xmath18 and @xmath40 in @xmath14 , and d in @xmath36 .",
    "the fact that only 50 per cent of the photons collected by the telescope are incident on the photocathode has been taken into account in the above expression .    using the above expression and the parameters given tables  [ t : windpar ] and [ t : wdeppar ] we computed the number of counts per second expected from a 10.0 mag star , and the results",
    "are also given table  [ t : expcnts ] .",
    "the absolute fluxes for a 0 mag a0v star were taken from johnson ( 1966 ) for the @xmath47 bands and from bessel ( 1979 ) for the @xmath48 bands .",
    "the bandwidths and the combined responses of the filter - detector combination were read from figure  [ f : filterdet ] .",
    "the table also gives the deficiency factor ( @xmath49 ) of observed counts , which is the ratio of the the expected photon rates to the scaled down count rates for 10.0 mag star .",
    "the fwhms of the bands estimated from the plots shown in figure  [ f : filterdet ] , and the mean extinction at vbo usually observed during the january  march period , which were used for the computations , are also given in the table .    from table",
    "[ t : expcnts ] we see that the deficiency factors in the @xmath4 bands are 22 , 22 , 8 , 7 and 8 , respectively .",
    "the reflectivity of the telescope was taken as 70% for the computation of the expected photon rates .",
    "the implied reflectivity of about 84% for the mirrors is likely to be on the higher side , considering the fact that the mirrors were aluminized a few years back .",
    "the dichroic filters used in the @xmath50 and @xmath51 channels were acquired more than 12 years back .",
    "there is also a possibility that their reflectivities and transmittances have deteriorated over time , even though they were kept inside their boxes .",
    "these factors would have increased the deficiency factors in all the spectral bands in a similar way .",
    "the identical deficiency factors in the @xmath50 and @xmath51 are almost three times those of @xmath52 bands , which are again identical within observational uncertainties .",
    "it may be noted that both the @xmath50 and @xmath51 bands have identical photomultipliers and pulse amplifier - discriminators , and the photomultipliers were operated at the same high voltages of 2300  v. the identical photon deficiency factors for these bands indicate the definite possibility that all the detected photons were not counted .",
    "the photomultipliers at 2300  v were already operated at very high gains ( see table  [ t : maxall ] ) . the discriminator level is factory set in ad6 model pulse amplifier - discriminators , and they may not be actually set at the valley of the pulse height distribution of the photomultipliers used . the possibility of using a pre - amplifier in these channels should be examined .",
    "it is likely that a fraction of the deficiency factor in the @xmath52 channel also arises from not counting all the detected photons since poor reflectivities of the telescope mirrors may not be able to account for the rather high deficiency factor of 8 observed in that channel . from table",
    "[ t : maxall ] we see that the hamamatsu tube also has a very high gain when it is operated at a high voltage of 1900  v. the discriminator level of c9744 can be adjusted manually .",
    "the possibility of lowering the discriminator level in the @xmath52 channel also should be examined .",
    "if the output pulses from the amplifier - discriminators show a large range , the pulse counters may not be responding to the low amplitude pulses .",
    "in such a case introducing a high bandwidth pulse amplifier before the counters might help in reducing the deficiency factor .",
    "as already mentioned , the hamamatsu r943 - 02 tube is mounted in fact50 model chamber , which is of forced air - cooled type , for reducing the dark counts . in figure",
    "[ f : ccurve ] we have plotted the observed cooling curves of this model for different temperature settings . along the vertical axis in the figure we have plotted the difference in temperatures , in the sense , chamber temperature minus ambient temperature .",
    "we find from the figure that at the coolest setting , which is usually the case while observing , it takes about two hours for the chamber to attain the maximum difference in temperature with respect to the ambient , and hence , the cooling unit should be switched on at least two hours before the beginning of the observations .    in figure",
    "[ f : pmtamb ] we have plotted the pmt chamber - temperatures observed after three hours of switching on of the cooling unit against the corresponding ambient temperature .",
    "probably , the difference in temperature attained does not depend on the ambient temperature .",
    "the average difference in temperature observed is 44.3c with a standard deviation of 0.4c .",
    "the pmt temperature will be varying with the variation in the ambient temperature over the course night .",
    "however , this will not have adverse effects since the ambient temperature will not be varying significant during the period of observation of an object .",
