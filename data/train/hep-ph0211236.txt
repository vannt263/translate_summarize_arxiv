    "the neutrino experiments show that the neutrino parameters have two exotic while interesting features , _ i.e. _ , the extreme smallness of the neutrino masses and the large size of the neutrino mixing angles@xcite . according to the recent analyses the atmospheric neutrino oscillation favors the @xmath1 process with the best fit values@xcite @xmath2 among the four oscillation solutions for the solar neutrino problem , the large mixing angle msw ( lma ) solution",
    "is most favored , followed by the low and vac solutions@xcite .",
    "the best fit values for the lma solution are@xcite @xmath3 the same analysis excludes the small mixing angle ( sma ) solution at 3.7 @xmath4 level . on the theoretical side , hundreds of neutrino mass models have been constructed in the literature@xcite , each trying to explain to a greater or lesser degree the two afore - mentioned features .",
    "a consensus has now emerged that the see - saw mechanism seems to be the most natural and economical way to account for the tiny neutrino masses .    in the see - saw mechanism , the standard model ( sm )",
    "is extended by including the right - handed majorana neutrinos , @xmath5 .",
    "since @xmath5 are the sm gauge group , @xmath6 , singlets , their masses are not protected by the sm gauge symmetry .",
    "the @xmath5 may get masses at very high energy scale and may be much heavier than the sm particles . having both left- and right - handed neutrinos and the @xmath5 being singlets , the neutrinos can have both dirac mass terms , @xmath7 and majorana mass terms , @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the charge conjugate matrix . integrating out the heavy right - handed neutrinos",
    ", we get the majorana mass terms for the left - handed neutrinos , @xmath10 with @xmath11 since @xmath12 , we have @xmath13 is much smaller than the electro - weak scale @xmath14 .",
    "the see - saw mechanism is typically realized within the framework of a supersymmetric ( susy ) grand unified theory ( gut ) , which adds further desirable features including unification of the sm gauge couplings at the gut scale and avoidance of the sm hierarchy problem . in an so(10 ) gut , see - saw mechanism is a natural outcome of the group theory .",
    "however , no generally accepted mechanism has yet been put forth to explain the large neutrino mixing angles until now@xcite .",
    "the difficulty relies on the two facts that ( i ) the neutrino spectrum exhibits large hierarchy , which usually means small mixing among the neutrinos and ( ii ) in grand unified models the lepton and the quark mass matrices are closely related , which generally makes it difficult to accommodate small quark mixing and large lepton mixing in one scheme .",
    "an elegant idea proposed to explain the large neutrino mixing angle is the so called `` lopsided '' structure@xcite . in this scheme the neutrino mass matrix , @xmath13 , produces small mixing according to the fact ( i ) .",
    "however , the charged lepton mass matrix , @xmath15 , produces large mixing and the difficulty relying on the fact ( ii ) is cleverly solved . as we know , the neutrino mixing is actually the mismatch between @xmath15 and @xmath13 . diagonalizing @xmath15 and @xmath13 by @xmath16 and @xmath17 we have the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath18 so the large",
    "mixing in @xmath19 leads to large mixing in the physical mixing matrix , @xmath20 .",
    "the `` lopsided '' structure works as follow . in an su(5 ) grand unified model , the left - handed charged leptons are in the same multiplets as the cp conjugates of the right - handed down - type quarks , and therefore @xmath15 is closely related to the _ transpose _ of the mass matrix of the down - type quarks , @xmath21 .",
    "the two mass matrices have the following approximate forms : @xmath22 respectively , with @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and the zeros representing entries much smaller than @xmath25 . for @xmath15",
    ", @xmath4 controls the mixing between the second and the third families of the left - handed leptons , which greatly enhances @xmath26 , while @xmath25 controls the mixing between the second and the third families of the right - handed leptons , which is not observable at low energy . for the quarks",
    "the roles of @xmath4 and @xmath25 are reversed : the small @xmath27 mixing is in the left - handed sector , accounting for the smallness of @xmath28 , while the large @xmath29 mixing is in the right - handed sector , which is not observable .    a larger gauge group with su(5 ) being",
    "its subgroup also has the above property .",
    "many realistic supersymmetric grand unified models have been built based on the ideas of see - saw mechanism and `` lopsided '' structure in the literature to account for the neutrino properties@xcite .",
    "all such models have a definite prediction  the lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) at low energy , which can be used to test this kind of models .",
    "we investigate the lfv prediction in this kind of models .",
    "in a supersymmetric model , the soft susy breaking terms may induce large lepton flavor violation .",
    "the possible lfv sources are the off - diagonal terms of the slepton mass matrices @xmath30 , @xmath31 and the trilinear couplings @xmath32 .",
    "present experimental bounds on the lfv processes give strong constraints on such off - diagonal terms , with the strongest constraint coming from br(@xmath0 ) ( @xmath33@xcite ) .",
    "we have to find a mechanism to align the lepton and the scalar lepton bases .",
    "this is the so called susy flavor problem .",
    "a generally adopted way to avoid these dangerous off - diagonal terms is to impose universality constraints on the soft terms at the susy - breaking scale , such as in the gravity - mediated@xcite or gauge - mediated@xcite susy - breaking scenarios . yet ,",
    "even with the universality condition , off - diagonal terms can be induced at lower energy scales through quantum effects .",
    "such lfv effects induced in the susy see - saw mechanism are given in the next section .",

    "@xmath101 is constrained by the values of up - type quark masses and the ckm mixing angles . by our second assumption that there is no accidental cancellation between the mixing matrices for the up- and down - type quarks leading to small ckm mixing",

    "we thus expect that the 1 - 3 mixing angle produced by @xmath70 , @xmath106 , is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath104 .",
    "then we have @xmath107 .",
    "analogously , we have @xmath108 .",
    "third , we observed that in most models @xmath109 and @xmath110 got their masses mainly from the 2 - 3 block of the lepton mass matrix .",

    "( [ lop ] ) , one finds that@xcite @xmath112 and @xmath113 with @xmath114 being mixing angles in @xmath19 . finally , taking into account that @xmath115 in `` lopsided '' models we get @xmath116 thus the angles in @xmath19 alone can determine @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "this conclusion certainly depends on the assumed forms of @xmath71 and @xmath70 ; nonetheless , it is correct in most published `` lopsided '' models@xcite , which can be explicitly checked .",

    "however , the branching ratio of @xmath150 predicted by these models generally exceeds the present experimental limit . an extended `` lopsided '' form of the charged lepton mass matrix is then proposed to solve this problem .",
    "the new structure can produce maximal 2 - 3 mixing , large 1 - 2 mixing while very small 1 - 3 mixing in the lepton sector .",
