    "with the rapid development of quantum technology in recent years , more and more researchers are paying attention to quantum control systems , which are an important part in quantum information science . on the other hand",
    ", it is found that many methodologies in classical ( namely non - quantum ) control theory , can be extended into the quantum regime @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , quantum control has its special features absent in the classical case , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for example , a controller in a quantum feedback control system may be classical , quantum or even mixed quantum / classical @xcite .",
    "generally speaking , in the physics literature , the feedback control problem in which the designed controller is also a fully quantum system is often named as `` coherent feedback control '' .",
    "optimal control , as a vital concept in classical control theory @xcite , has been widely studied . @xmath1 and @xmath2 control are the two foremost control methods in classical control theory , which aim to minimize cost functions with specific forms from exogenous inputs ( disturbances or noises ) to pertinent performance outputs .",
    "when the disturbances and measurement noises are gaussian stochastic processes with known power spectral densities , and the objective is a quadratic performance criterion , then the problem of minimizing this quadratic cost function of linear systems is named as lqg control problem , which has been proved to be equivalent to an @xmath1 optimal control problem @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath2 control problem mainly concerns the robustness of a system to parameter uncertainty or external disturbance signals , and a controller to be designed should make the closed - loop system stable , meanwhile minimizing the influence of disturbances or system uncertainties on the system performance in terms of the @xmath2 norm of a certain transfer function .",
    "furthermore , the mixed lqg ( or @xmath1 ) and @xmath2 control problem for classical systems has been studied widely during the last three decades . when the control system is subject to both white noises and signals with bounded power , not only optimal performance ( measured in @xmath1 norm ) but also robustness specifications ( in terms of an @xmath2 constraint )",
    "should be taken into account , which is one of the main motivations for considering the mixed control problem @xcite ; see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and the references therein .",
    "very recently , researchers have turned to consider the optimal control problem of quantum systems .",
    "for instance , @xmath2 control of linear quantum stochastic systems is investigated in @xcite , three different types of controllers are designed .",
    "@xcite proposes a method for quantum lqg control , for which the designed controller is also a fully quantum system . in @xcite , direct coupling and indirect coupling for quantum linear systems have been discussed .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that phase shifters and ideal squeezers can be used in feedback loop for better control performance .",
    "nevertheless , all of above papers mainly focus on the vacuum inputs , while the authors in @xcite concern not only the vacuum case , but also the thermal input .",
    "they also discussed how to design both classical and non - classical controllers for lqg control problem .",
    "besides , because of non - linear and non - convex constraints in the coherent quantum controller synthesis , @xcite uses a differential evolution algorithm to construct an optimal linear coherent quantum controller . notwithstanding the above research , to our best knowledge , there is little research on the mixed lqg and @xmath2 coherent control problem for linear quantum systems , except @xcite .",
    "similar to the classical case , in mixed lqg and @xmath2 quantum coherent control , lqg and @xmath2 performances are not independent . moreover , because the controller to be designed is another quantum - mechanical system , it has to satisfy additional constraints , which are called `` physical realizability conditions '' @xcite . for more details",
    ", please refer to section [ problem_formulation ] .",
    "the contribution of the paper is three - fold .",
    "firstly , a _",
    "mixed _ lqg and @xmath2 coherent feedback control problem has been studied , while most of the present literatures ( except the conference paper @xcite , by one of the authors ) only focus on lqg or @xmath2 control problem separately . for a typical quantum optical system ,",
    "there exist quantum white noise as well as finite energy signals ( like lasers ) , while quantum white noise can be dealt with lqg control , finite energy disturbance can better handled by @xmath0 control .",
    "as a result , it is important to study the mixed control problem . secondly , we extend theorem 4.1 in @xcite , and prove a general result for the lower bound of lqg index .",
    "finally , we propose a genetic - algorithm - based method to design a coherent controller for this mixed problem .",
    "in contrast to the numerical algorithm proposed in the earlier conference paper @xcite by one of the authors , the new algorithm is much simpler and is able to produce better results , as clearly demonstrated by numerical studies .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ quantum system ] ,",

    "this heuristic ( sometimes called metaheuristic ) is routinely used to generate useful solutions to optimization and search problems .",
    "genetic algorithm belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms , which get solutions using techniques inspired by natural evolution , such as inheritance , mutation , selection , and crossover , etc .",
    "genetic algorithm is a useful method for controller design , see e.g. , @xcite . in the field of quantum control ,",
    "genetic algorithm methods are applied to design quantum coherent feedback controllers , see e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we briefly introduce the procedures of genetic algorithm as follows .",
    "( genetic algorithm )    step 1 : :    : initialization for the population ( the first generation ) , by using    random functions , and binary strings denote controller parameters we    want to design ; step 2 : :    : transform binary strings to decimal numbers , and calculate the    results of these parameters ; step 3 : :    : after obtaining coefficient matrices of the controller , we restrict    one of the lqg or @xmath2 indices in an interval ,    then minimize the other index ( the fitness function in our problem ) .",
    "since the lower bounds of these two indices can be calculated a    priori , see sections [ lqg analysis ] and [ hinf analysis ] , the    above - mentioned interval can always be found . by the above procedure",
    "we get the best individual and corresponding performance index in this    generation ; step 4 : :    : perform the selection operation , for yielding new individuals ; step 5 : :    : perform the crossover operation , for yielding new individuals ; step 6 : :    : perform the mutation operation , for yielding new individuals ; step 7 : :    : back to step 2 , recalculate all parameters and corresponding best    fitness function result for new generation ; step 8 : :    : at the end of iterations , compare all best results of every    generation , and get the optimal solution .",
    "algorithm 2 does not minimize both lqg and @xmath0 performance indices simultaneously . more specifically , as can be seen in step 3 , one of the indices is first fixed , then the other one is minimized .",
    "this procedure is repeated as can be seen from step 7 .",
    "therefore , algorithm 2 is an iterative minimization algorithm .    in our problem , because the coherent feedback controller @xmath138 to be designed is a quantum system , it can be described by the @xmath37 language introduced in subsection [ subsec : system ] . with this , physical realizability conditions are naturally satisfied . as a result",
    "we apply the ga to find @xmath138 by minimizing the lqg and @xmath0 performance indices directly .",
    "in this section , we provide two examples to illustrate the methods proposed in the previous section .",
    "_ example 1 : _ this example is taken from section slowromancap7@ of @xcite . the plant is an optical cavity resonantly coupled to three optical channels .",
    "the dynamics of this optical cavity system can be described by following equations @xmath324 with parameters @xmath325 , @xmath326 , @xmath327 . in this example",
    ", @xmath151 is quantum white noise , while @xmath77 is a sum of quantum white noise and @xmath85 disturbance ( see assumption 1 for details ) .",
    "therefore , there are two types of noises in this system .",
    "lqg control is used to suppress the influence of quantum white noise , while @xmath0 control is used to attenuate the @xmath85 disturbance .",
    "_ example 2 : _ in this example , we choose a dpa as our plant . for more details about dpa",
    ", one may refer to @xcite .",
    "the qsdes of dpa are @xmath328 with parameters @xmath325 , @xmath329 , @xmath330 , @xmath331 .    according to theorem [ lower bound lqg ] , it is easy to find that lower bounds of the lqg index for both two examples are 1 .",
    "firstly , we only focus on the lqg performance index , and design two different types of controllers to minimize it by using genetic algorithm .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ res one index lqg ] .",
    "for each case , we list two values obtained .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ results ga ]      after getting numerical results shown in table  [ results lmi ] and table  [ results ga ] , and doing comparisons with other literatures in coherent optimal control for linear quantum systems , we state the advantages of algorithm 2 :    1 .   instead of single lqg or @xmath2 optimal control for linear quantum systems , algorithm 2 deals with the _ mixed _ lqg and @xmath2 problem .",
    "algorithm 1 relaxes two performance indices by introducing @xmath322 and @xmath323 .",
    "when they are small , it will be quite difficult to solve the problem by algorithm 1 . but",
    "algorithm 2 is able to minimize the two performance indices directly .",
    "the solution of the differential evolution algorithm in @xcite involves a complex algebraic riccati equation , but all parameters of our algorithm 2 are real .",
    "it might be easier to be solved by current computer software such as matlab .",
    "the numerical results show that there seems to be a trend between these two indices , that sometimes one increases , while another decreases . 5 .   for a passive system ( e.g. cavity ) , both the passive controller and the non - passive controller could let lqg and @xmath2 indices go to the minima simultaneously , table  [ results ga ] . 6 .   for a non - passive system ( e.g. dpa )",
    ", neither the passive controller nor the non - passive controller can let these two indices go to the minima simultaneously , but when a direct coupling is added between the plant and the controller , we could use genetic algorithm to design a passive controller to minimize these two indices simultaneously , which is not achieved using rank constrained lmi method , table  [ results ga ]",
    "actually , rank constrained lmi method could not be used to design specific passive controllers , or non - passive controllers , while this can be easily achieved using genetic algorithm , by setting all `` plus '' terms equal to 0 .",
    "finally , from numerical simulations , genetic algorithm often provides better results than the rank constrained lmi method .",
