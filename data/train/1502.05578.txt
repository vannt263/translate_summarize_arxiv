    "the main premise of preferential attachment  @xcite is that popularity is attractive  @xcite , but similarity is also attractive  @xcite . combined together these two attractive forces , popularity and similarity , have shown to form hidden hyperbolic geometries that drive evolution of networks  @xcite . since these geometries are hidden , effective , or latent , they must be inferred from the network structure .",
    "specifically what must be inferred are node coordinates in these underlying hyperbolic spaces .",
    "existing approaches  @xcite to such inference are based on the connections ( and disconnections ) between the nodes , i.e. , on the links that the nodes have ( or do not have ) .",
    "connected nodes are attracted to each other , while disconnected nodes repel , and these approaches are placing nodes into a hyperbolic space based on these attraction and repulsion forces .",
    "both approaches in  @xcite are based on _ maximum likelihood estimation_. the approach in  @xcite embeds a given network topology into the hyperbolic plane by maximizing the likelihood that the topology is produced by the equilibrium hyperbolic network model  @xcite , while the approach in  @xcite embeds the network by maximizing the likelihood that the topology is produced by the hyperbolic model of growing networks  @xcite .",
    "both approaches produce similar results , even though there are fundamental differences between them . in this paper",
    ", we build on the latter approach  @xcite , which is more recent and simpler to implement .    the work in  @xcite shows that trade - offs between popularity and similarity shape the structure and dynamics of growing complex networks , and that these tradeoffs in network dynamics give rise to hyperbolic geometry .",
    "the growing network model in  @xcite is essentially a model of random geometric graphs growing in hyperbolic spaces .",
    "synthetic graphs grown according to this simple model simultaneously exhibit many common structural and dynamical characteristics of real networks .",
    "we call the model in  @xcite the popularity@xmath4similarity optimization ( pso ) model .",
    "given the ability of the pso model to construct synthetic growing networks that resemble real networks across a wide range of structural and dynamical characteristics , the work in  @xcite showed how to reverse this synthesis , and given a real network , how to map ( embed ) the network into the hyperbolic plane , in a way congruent with the pso model .",
    "specifically , the mapping method of  @xcite , called _ hypermap _ , replays the network s geometric growth , estimating at each time step the hyperbolic coordinates of new nodes by maximizing the likelihood of the network snapshot in the model . in the inferred polar coordinates of nodes , the radial coordinate @xmath5 can be associated with node popularity , while the angular coordinate @xmath6 is the node coordinate in the similarity space abstracted by a circle .",
    "hypermap has been applied to the autonomous systems ( as ) topology of the real internet in  @xcite , where it was shown that : ( i ) the method can identify soft communities of ases belonging to the same geographic region , even though the method is completely geography - agnostic ; ( ii ) the method can predict _ missing _ links between ases with high precision , outperforming popular existing methods ; and ( iii ) that the method can construct a highly navigable internet map ",
    "greedy forwarding in the map can reach destinations with more than 90% success probability and low stretch .",
    "here we introduce and explore a new method for inferring the node similarity coordinates , and release its implementation to public  @xcite .",
    "this method differs from the one in  @xcite in that it is not based on the links that the nodes have or do not have .",
    "instead , it is based on the _ number of common neighbors _ between the nodes .",
    "the method is inspired by the observation that the number of common neighbors between two nodes is a measure of similarity between the nodes ; in general , the more the common neighbors between two nodes the more similar the two nodes are , i.e. , the smaller their similarity distance  @xcite .",
    "we call the approach in  @xcite the _ link - based approach _ , and the approach considered here the _ common - neighbors approach_. we compare the two approaches and find that for high degree nodes the common - neighbors approach yields a more accurate inference than the link - based method , unless heuristic periodic adjustments ( or  correction steps \"  @xcite ) are used in the latter . on the other hand ,",
    "the common - neighbors approach is computationally intensive , requiring @xmath0 running time to map a network of @xmath1 nodes , versus @xmath2 in the link - based method .",
    "based on these above observations , we then introduce a hybrid method with @xmath2 running time , which combines the common - neighbors and link - based approaches , and explore a heuristic that can reduce its running time further to @xmath3 , without significantly sacrificing the embedding accuracy .",
    "we apply this method to snapshots of the real internet to reveal how soft communities of ases evolve over time in the similarity space .",
    "we also demonstrate the method s predictive power by forecasting _",
    "future _ links between ases . taken altogether",
    ", our results advance our understanding of how to efficiently and accurately map real networks to their latent hyperbolic spaces , which is an important necessary step towards understanding the laws that govern the dynamics of nodes in these spaces , and the fine - grained dynamics of network connections .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : preliminaries ] , we review the extended pso ( e - pso ) model from  @xcite and the details of the hypermap method that we need in this paper . in section  [ sec : common_neighbors_mapping ] , we show how the angular coordinates of nodes can be inferred using the common - neighbors approach , and describe the hybrid method . in section  [ sec : embedding_speedup ] , we describe how to speedup the method , and in section  [ sec : validation ] , we validate our results in synthetic networks . in section  [ sec : internet ] , we apply the hybrid method to the as internet . in section  [ sec : other_work ] , we discuss other relevant work , and in section  [ sec : conclusion ] , we conclude with a discussion of open problems and future work .",
    "the e - pso model of growing networks has been introduced in  @xcite for hypermap development purposes . as its name suggests , this model is a modification of the pso model in  @xcite .",
    "the e - pso model constructs growing networks using external links only , while being equivalent to the generalized pso model in  @xcite that uses both external and internal links  @xcite .",
    "external links connect new nodes to existing nodes , while internal links appear between existing nodes only .",
    "given a single snapshot of the topology of a real network , there is no way to distinguish external links from internal links .",
    "the e - pso model sidesteps this obstacle , and helps to map a given real network topology by replaying its geometric growth , treating all links in the topology _ as if _ they were external  @xcite .",
    "below , we first review the e - pso model , and then proceed to hypermap , which is based on this model .",

    "hypermap first estimates the mle appearance ( or birth ) times of nodes @xmath26 .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , the higher the degree of a node in the e - pso model the earlier its mle appearance time .",

    "<S> we introduce and explore a new method for inferring hidden geometric coordinates of nodes in complex networks based on the number of common neighbors between the nodes . </S>",
    "<S> we compare this approach to the hypermap method , which is based only on the connections ( and disconnections ) between the nodes , i.e. , on the links that the nodes have ( or do not have ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for high degree nodes the common - neighbors approach yields a more accurate inference than the link - based method , unless heuristic periodic adjustments ( or  correction steps \" ) are used in the latter . </S>",
    "<S> the common - neighbors approach is computationally intensive , requiring @xmath0 running time to map a network of @xmath1 nodes , versus @xmath2 in the link - based method . </S>",
    "<S> but we also develop a hybrid method with @xmath2 running time , which combines the common - neighbors and link - based approaches , and explore a heuristic that reduces its running time further to @xmath3 , without significant reduction in the mapping accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this method to the autonomous systems ( as ) internet , and reveal how soft communities of ases evolve over time in the similarity space . </S>",
    "<S> we further demonstrate the method s predictive power by forecasting future links between ases . </S>",
    "<S> taken altogether , our results advance our understanding of how to efficiently and accurately map real networks to their latent geometric spaces , which is an important necessary step towards understanding the laws that govern the dynamics of nodes in these spaces , and the fine - grained dynamics of network connections . </S>"
