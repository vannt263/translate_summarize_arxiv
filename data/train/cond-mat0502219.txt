    "many bulk properties of polycrystals are strongly influenced by the underlying microstructure .",
    "much effort goes into predicting the motion of grain boundaries in response to a variety of driving forces .",
    "depending on the nature of the grains , their boundaries migrate in response to applied stresses @xcite or magnetic fields @xcite , internal forces associated with grain boundary curvature @xcite , concentration gradients @xcite , etc .",
    "successful models of microstructure evolution must be supplied with the details of the ways in which the grain boundaries respond to the driving forces .",
    "based on general conclusions of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics , one would expect the interface to have a unique mobility , i.e. ,  a unique response coefficient to disparate driving forces .",
    "this conclusion was recently called into question by both experiments in polycrystals @xcite and simulations of ising interfaces @xcite .",
    "these works observed drastically different shapes of shrinking grains .",
    "grains shrinking under the influence of capillarity alone were roughly circular whereas the presence of other driving forces resulted in strongly anisotropic shapes .",
    "this observation was most simply interpreted in terms of different interfacial mobilities for different driving forces .",
    "a resolution of this apparent paradox in the ising model @xcite , which does not require a non - unique mobility , rests with identifying the crucial role of anisotropy in the calculation of the capillary driving force .",
    "this driving force is the strongly anisotropic interfacial stiffness @xcite , i.e. ,   the sum @xmath6 of the excess free - energy of the interface @xmath7 and its second derivative with respect to inclination , rather than @xmath7 itself which is much less anisotropic .",
    "it turns out that the reduced mobility , i.e. ,  the product of the capillary driving force and the bare mobility , is roughly isotropic , and therefore the grain shape is isotropic as well .",
    "here we shed further light on the microscopic mechanism for cancellation of the anisotropies of the interfacial stiffness and the interfacial mobility in both 2d and 3d .",
    "the precise microscopic mechanisms responsible for the migration of grain boundaries are complex . however , there is hope that generic features near equilibrium are shared by a large class of models of moving interfaces .",
    "it is with this hope in mind we use the kinetic ising model ( kim ) , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , as a proxy for studying grain boundaries .",
    "the kim is defined by a collection of spins @xmath8 on a lattice , a total energy which is a function of this collection , and rules for dynamic evolution of the spins at some temperature @xmath9 .",
    "the energy in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath10 is @xmath11 where the sum in the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) is over pairs of nearest neighbors .",
    "glauber dynamics @xcite is one possible scheme for evolving the collection of spins in such a way as to obtain correct distributions in equilibrium .",
    "this model is perhaps the simplest representation of non - equilibrium dynamics of interfaces .",
    "it can be used to explore effects of lattice anisotropy on the motion of domain walls driven by magnetic field or capillary forces .",
    "in addition , domain nucleation and late stages of phase separation can be addressed within the kim . with simple modifications",
    "the kim can be used to study the phenomenology of interface motion in the presence of mobile or quenched impurities .",
    "much is known about the equilibrium behavior of ising interfaces .",
    "for example , an exact expression for the interfacial free energy has been derived in 2d on a square lattice @xcite .",
    "approximate expressions for this free energy and critical amplitudes in 3d have also been derived @xcite .",
    "the non - equilibrium behavior of the kim is more complicated .",
    "whereas several approximate analytic results exist for the mobility of a domain wall in 2d @xcite , little progress has been achieved is 3d .    here",
    "we construct a simple and intuitive kinetic description of low temperature domain walls in the kim based on the kink degrees of freedom .",
    "the density of kinks is shown to obey a non - linear diffusion equation , which is equivalent to the law of anisotropic interface motion driven by curvature and/or an external field derived from the interface free - energy and mobility .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , in our kink description , we obtain the law of interface motion directly in the continuum limit _ without _ these expressions as input into our calculation .",
    "hence , our kink - based theory can be viewed as a direct microscopic derivation of the law of interface motion in the low temperature limit of the kim , free of extraneous assumptions . moreover , the kink - based description is useful for analyzing more complicated situations .",
    "we illustrate this point both by extending the analysis of anisotropic interface motion to 3d and by examining impurity effects in 2d",
    ".    section [ sec:2d ] of this paper is devoted to the 2d kim while the following sec .",

    "[ sec : direct ] , we rederive the velocity of a curved ising domain wall driven by capillary forces using kinks as the degrees of freedom responsible for the motion of the interface .",

    "[ sec : evolution ] . in the following section [ sec : impure ]",
    "we illustrate the usefulness of the kink description by considering the influence of impurities on the grain boundary motion . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3d ] , we study curvature driven motion in 3d near a high symmetry singular orientation where the interface can be represented by a collection of terraces composed of kinks .",
    "this allows us to use the 2d analytic results to calculate the interface velocity and therefore the mobility tensor near this symmetry direction .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in section iv .",
    "let us summarize the analytical results obtained so far for the kim , focusing on the expressions that have been derived for the interface mobility . in 2d ,",
    "the exact interfacial free energy is known @xcite . for our purposes",
    "it suffices to write down the first two terms in the temperature expansion ( enthalpic and entropic respectively ) .",
    "when the spins are arranged on a square ( denoted by a @xmath12 ) lattice of unit lattice spacing , this energy is @xmath13,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the inclination defined as the angle of the interface normal with respect to the @xmath17 axis of the underlying lattice .    when spins flip according to non - conserved glauber dynamics @xcite , the interface moves to minimize the free energy of the system which consists of the bulk and the interface contributions .",
    "spohn @xcite has derived the sharp interface continuum description of a domain wall in kim .",
    "it follows from his derivation that the normal velocity of the interface @xmath18 is the product of the mobility @xmath1 and a driving force . from the continuum description",
    "it also follows that in the absence of magnetic field , the driving force is the product of the mean curvature of the interface @xmath3 and the interface stiffness . in 2d , the stiffness is @xmath2 , where @xmath19 denotes the second derivative of @xmath7 with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "using a green - kubo perturbative formalism , spohn obtained the interface mobility in the limit of small temperature and small driving magnetic field .",
    "the same result was obtained earlier by barma @xcite using a mapping of the dynamics of the low - temperature ising interface to the one - dimensional exclusion process .",
    "rikvold and kolesik obtained analytical expressions valid for large fields and temperatures @xcite .",
    "the leading term in the temperature expansion of the mobility diverges like @xmath20    [ eq : m2d ] @xmath21    where @xmath12 refers to a square lattice and @xmath22 to a triangular lattice .",
    "in addition , @xmath23 is the intrinsic time scale of the glauber dynamics which is the inverse frequency of the attempted spin flips .",
    "the triangular lattice formula is valid in the @xmath24 $ ] domain and can be extended to the other angles via an appropriate symmetry transformation .",
    "the above expressions for the interface energy and mobility can be combined to arrive at the continuum ( or mean field ) low temperature equation of motion of the interface driven by curvature @xmath3 and magnetic field @xmath25 .",
    "the normal velocity of the interface is @xmath26 = m^*_\\mathrm{2d } \\ , \\kappa +    m_\\mathrm{2d } \\ , h,\\ ] ] where the reduced mobility on the square lattice is ( see appendix  [ app : derivation ] for the triangular lattice result ) @xmath27    note that the reduced mobility is roughly isotropic whereas the bare mobility is strongly anisotropic .",
    "in addition , the reduced mobility does not diverge in the @xmath28 limit whereas the bare mobility does .",
    "this happens because the contribution of the enthalpic term @xmath29 to the interfacial stiffness evaluates to zero .",
    "therefore , only the entropic term ( which is proportional to t ) contributes to the stiffness .",
    "moreover , the contribution due to the entropic term diverges at the high symmetry orientations whereas the bare mobility vanishes at those orientations in such a way that the product of the two quantities produces a finite non - zero reduced mobility .",
    "this behavior is responsible for the nearly circular shape of a shrinking grain on a hexagonal lattice in ref .",
    "@xcite .      the basic law of interface motion embodied in eq .",
    "is usually derived using a thermodynamic approach where the interface free - energy and mobility are computed separately . this approach , even though general , lacks intuitive appeal .",
    "furthermore , it is not simply extended to more complex situations .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to develop an alternative method for deriving eq .   directly from a microscopic picture without the need to compute the interface free - energy and mobility as intermediate steps .",
    "we develop such a method based on a low temperature description of the interface in terms of kinks . this simple microscopic picture , and the results obtained for the velocity of a shrinking grain in 2d , provide the basis for the subsequent incorporation of impurities and the derivation of an expression for the interface velocity in 3d",
    ".        when the temperature is low , @xmath31 , the only allowed spin flips are those that do not increase the total energy .",
    "therefore kink - antikink pairs can not nucleate at the interface .",
    "barma @xcite observed that the interface between the ising domains can then be represented by a staircase of kinks shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinks ] .",
    "the kinetics of kinks reduces to an exclusion process ( asymmetric in the presence of magnetic field ) @xcite .",
    "even though steady state properties of this process ( corresponding to a flat field - driven interface of a fixed inclination ) are well known , little progress has been made analytically to describe the evolution of a non - uniform kink distribution corresponding to a curved interface .",
    "let us define the ensemble average density of kinks @xmath32 and derive its evolution equation , which is equivalent to eq .  .",
    "we outline the derivation here and relegate the details to appendix [ app : derivation ] .",
    "we focus here on the curvature driven motion while the appendix includes the effect of the magnetic field . unimpeded by its neighbors",
    ", each kink executes a random walk corresponding to purely diffusive motion .",
    "many kinks can `` pile - up '' at the same site but can not pass through each other . via a transformation which inserts an extra lattice site between every pair of neighboring kinks ( illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mapping ] ) , we map the dynamics of kinks onto the problem of 1d random walkers which can not occupy the same lattice site .",
    "the density of walkers for this symmetric exclusion process obeys a simple diffusion equation @xcite .",
    "this is true because when two walkers collide , their indices can be exchanged ( i.e. their `` identities '' switched ) without affecting their density .",
    "thus a collision can be viewed as the tunneling of the kinks through each other without affecting each other .",
    "the density of hard core random walkers is insensitive to this identity - switching transformation and must therefore satisfy a diffusion equation .",
    "when transformed back to the original coordinate system in which kinks can pile up , the equation for @xmath32 reads for the square lattice ( see appendix [ app : derivation ] for the triangular lattice version ) @xmath33 where subscripts denote differentiation , @xmath34 is the flux of kinks and @xmath35 is the kink `` chemical potential . ''",
    "is a nonlinear diffusion equation with the diffusivity @xmath36 which is a decreasing function of density .",
    "this reduction results from the fact that when more than two kinks occupy the same site , some of these kinks are completely immobile . since the density of kinks is defined for interfaces inclined with respect to the @xmath37 orientation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho_t ] ) has to be supplemented by boundary conditions which piece together different @xmath38 sectors of the grain boundary .     for details.,width=316 ]",
    "geometrically , the density of kinks is the local slope of the interface with respect to the low energy @xmath17 orientation .",
    "it is therefore easy to show that eq .   with @xmath39 and eq .",
    "are equivalent ( see appendix [ app : derivation ] ) .",
    "thus we derived the equation of motion for the interface without assuming the applicability of the continuum description of the interface .",
    "even though , for clarity , we have restricted our discussion above to motion by curvature only , we derive in appendix [ app : derivation ] the evolution equation for the kink density for general motion by both curvature and an external field , and show that it is equivalent to eq .  .",
    "neglecting thermal excitation of kink - antikink pairs allowed us to construct an equation for a single density of kinks @xmath40 .",
    "in general local densities of kinks @xmath41 and anti - kinks @xmath42 must be considered .",
    "each density obeys the non - linear diffusion equation augmented by a source term proportional to @xmath43 , due to the creation of kink - antikink pairs , and a sink term proportional to the product @xmath44 due to the annihilation of kinks by anti - kinks .",
    "the local slope of the interface with respect to the low energy orientation is given by the sum @xmath45 of the kink and anti - kink densities .",
    "once the details of this two - density approach are worked out , a formal temperature perturbation expansion becomes possible since either @xmath41 or @xmath42 is exponentially small in low temperature limit . a small mobility for the high symmetry orientations , which are immobile at zeroth order ,",
    "will be the most important effect at the next order in the temperature expansion .",
    "let us now use the equation of motion to describe the evolution of an `` ising grain , '' i.e. ,  an island of down spins in a sea of up spins .",
    "the reduction of the interfacial free energy and spin alignment parallel to a positive magnetic field are the the driving forces for the grain shrinkage while negative magnetic field favors grain growth .",
    "the numerical method of solving is described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "when a sufficiently large negative is applied , the grain grows until it reaches a stationary configuration determined by its initial shape ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : shape]a ) .",
    "this happens because the velocity of the interface in the direction of the low energy planes is never outward since the mobility vanishes for these orientations .",
    "thus a grain can not grow beyond its initial size .",
    "any growth process has to include the nucleation of kink - antikink pairs which is explicitly ignored in our description .",
    "the amplitude of the positive magnetic field @xmath10 determines the shape of the shrinking grain .",
    "when @xmath46 , the second term in eq .   dominates . note that for large grains this crossover magnetic field vanishes like @xmath47 .",
    "the shape of the grain shrinking under these conditions , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : shape]b , is strongly anisotropic .",
    "when the applied field is much smaller then the crossover field , the evolution is controlled by the more isotropic reduced mobility and thus the shape of a shrinking grain is close to a circle .",
    "even when initially the dynamics is controlled by the magnetic field , the crossover to curvature dominated dynamics will happen when the grain shrinks to a sufficiently small size . in this regime , the grain shrinks in a self - similar manner ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : shape]c ) .      here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the square lattice while citing the results for the hexagonal lattice in appendix [ sec : self - similar_hex ] .",
    "we also set the time scale @xmath48 .",
    "slice of the grain defined by the dashed lines that converge in the center of the grain .",
    "the thick line is the grain boundary . the kink density @xmath40 is defined on a shrinking domain of width @xmath49.,width=188 ]    to compute the shape of a shrinking grain we need to specify the region in which our kink description holds and fix the boundary conditions at the edges of this region .",
    "since we expect the grain to possess four mirror planes inclined at 0 , @xmath50 and @xmath38 with respect to the @xmath17 plane , we will restrict ourselves to a @xmath51 wedge ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pi4slice ] ) .",
    "the slope at the left edge of the wedge ( @xmath52 ) is @xmath53 and the slope at the right edge ( @xmath54 ) is @xmath55 due to mirror symmetry around the @xmath51 plane and the smoothness of the grain shape .",
    "thus we are to solve eq .",
    "subject to the boundary conditions @xmath56    the final ingredient in determining the grain shape is the shrinking rate .",
    "the slice width @xmath49 shrinks as the kinks at its right edge flow to the left with a flux @xmath57 .",
    "every time the kinks move _ two _ sites to the left , the width of the slice is reduced by 1 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dmain_shrink ] for a visual explanation ) , and therefore @xmath58        as we mentioned above , in the absence of a magnetic field , the shape of the shrinking grain is self - similar . to prove this we seek a solution to the moving boundary problem defined by equations , and , which depends on space and time only through a combination @xmath59 . substituting this ansatz into the expression for the shrinking rate we obtain @xmath60 where prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath61 .",
    "thus the the rate of change of the grain area @xmath62 under this self - similar evolution is constant as expected .",
    "the kink diffusion equation becomes @xmath63 with @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "the constant @xmath67 is determined self - consistently by a shooting procedure .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] shows the comparison of the solution of to the ensemble averaged monte carlo simulation of diffusing hard - core kinks with boundary conditions appropriate to the shrinking grain scenario .",
    "quantitative agreement of the sharp interface result with the monte carlo simulation of the full kim was found in ref .",
    "@xcite .     across the arc . the exact density for a self - similar shrinking grain obtained by solving is compared to that obtained via a monte carlo simulation of diffusing impermeable kinks .",
    "the dashed line shows for comparison the density of kinks in a circular arc on a square lattice.,width=316 ]    it is useful to recast eq .   in terms of the polar parameterization of the self - similar shrinking grain @xmath68 .",
    "we chose to scale @xmath69 in such a way that @xmath70 .",

    "one of these conditions is automatically satisfied for the value of @xmath74 found above .",
    "let us finally mention another analytic result concerning the grain shrinking rate @xmath75 @xmath76 these formulas ( the square lattice result first appeared in ref .",
    "@xcite ) are a simple consequence of the fact that only the corner spins are allowed to flip ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : corner_spins ] ) .",
    "when a spin in a concave corner flips , the area of the grain increases by 1 ( square lattice ) . and vice versa , when a kink in convex corner flips , the area is reduced by 1 .",
    "since the probabilities of all allowed spin flips are the same and the number of convex kinks on a square lattice is greater than the number of concave kinks by 4 ( due to hopf s theorem which states that the rotation index of a simple curve is 1 ) , we arrive at . ref .",
    "@xcite checked that the shrinking rate on the hexagonal lattice is indeed @xmath77 .",
    "the kink picture of the low - temperature grain boundary dynamics is useful in understanding the effect of dilute immobile impurities .",
    "we model the interaction of the grain boundary with interstitial impurities by defining a variable @xmath78 on the dual lattice sites .",
    "@xmath79 when an impurity is present and @xmath80 otherwise .",
    "the impurities are randomly positioned on the dual lattice and do not move .",
    "the interaction of the impurities with the spins is introduced via an additional term in the energy @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the total magnetization of the ising spins nearest to the impurity located at site @xmath83 of the dual lattice and the sum is over all the dual lattice sites .",
    "figure [ fig : impurity - kink ] explains graphically that , depending on its position , an isolated impurity provides either a left or a right directed short range force acting on a kink .",
    "in addition to this force there is a two - kink effect which makes kink pile - ups energetically favorable when they occur on the impurity site .",
    "so far we considered only positively charged impurities @xmath84 .",
    "the interface is attracted to these impurities .",
    "negatively charged impurities with @xmath85 repel the interface . however , the qualitative picture of the kink - impurity interaction presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : impurity - kink ] still holds .",
    "the only difference is that the effect of the negative impurity on the top edge of the kink is equivalent to the effect of the positive impurity on the bottom edge and vice versa . in the limit of high density of impurities ,",
    "additional effects due to the interplay of positively and negatively charged impurities become important .",
    "for example , a row of alternating positive and negative impurities perpendicular to the interface pulls the interface along in one direction or another due to the ease of nucleating kink - antikink pairs .",
    "additional phenomena arise when both positively and negatively charged impurities are presented . exploring these these phenomena",
    "is outside the scope of this article .",
    "the diffusing kink picture is especially simple when the impurities are dilute and @xmath86 . in this limit",
    "the kinks diffuse only downslope in the static energy landscape produced by then impurities . when impurities are dilute , this energy landscape consists of a number of flat terraces bound by steep vertical cliffs or walls . the kinks diffuse and fall down cliffs until they fall onto a terrace which is bound by walls on both sides .",
    "the kinks become trapped on this terrace . in the long time",
    "limit , the density of the trapped kinks becomes uniform on this terrace .",
    "this means that the slope of the piece of grain boundary which corresponds to this terrace is a constant given by the density of the trapped kinks .",
    "this density depends on the initial distribution of kinks and impurities and can be anything .",
    "therefore , in this limit , the grain boundary is pinned and consists of a series of flat facets of random length and inclination .",
    "figure  [ fig : piecewise_flat ] presents results of the monte - carlo simulation of the low temperature 2d ising model in the presence of strong dilute positively charged immobile impurities .",
    "what is shown is the time - averaged location of the boundary between the spin up and spin down domains .",
    "the boundary is pinned and consists of straight pieces of random length and orientation .",
    "impurities are located at either end of each such facet .",
    "this result supports our qualitative picture .",
    "addition of magnetic field introduces yet another energy scale @xmath10 into the picture . when @xmath87 , the boundary is pinned .",
    "the shape of the pinned facets depends on the relative size of @xmath88 and length of the pinned facet @xmath89 . in equilibrium ,",
    "the kink drift due to the magnetic field is balanced by the diffusion due to curvature .",
    "thus small facets for which @xmath90 , remain straight .",
    "conversely , when @xmath91 , the long facets look like the corners of a droplet expanding in co - aligned magnetic field whose shape is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : shape]a .",
    "strong positive impurities ( @xmath92 ) in the bulk of a domain of aligned spins always have two spins near then that are anti - aligned with the rest of the spins in that domain .",
    "thus impurities serve as nuclei for the formation of droplets of the phase of spins aligned with the applied magnetic field .",
    "conversely , strong negatively charged impurities favor alignment of the nearby spins and thus can inhibit nucleation of the phase favored by the application of magnetic field .",
    "impurities which occupy 1% of the dual lattice sites is a collection of straight segments obtained via a monte - carlo simulation of the 2d ising model with an addition energy given in eq .",
    "whereas a curve on a plane can be characterized by a single scalar curvature , a smooth surface embedded in a three dimensional space is characterized by a rank two tensor @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "this tensor is called the second fundamental form or the weingarten map or just the curvature tensor .",
    "the trace of this tensor is the mean curvature , while its determinant is the gaussian curvature .",
    "this tensor is defined at some point @xmath95 by selecting an orthogonal coordinate system @xmath96 in the tangent plane at @xmath95 and writing @xmath97 where @xmath98 are the unit tangent vectors , and @xmath99 is the unit normal to the surface .",
    "the reduced mobility of a two - dimensional interface is also a rank two tensor @xmath100 which when contracted with the curvature tensor yields the normal velocity of the interface @xmath101 the reduced mobility tensor depends on the scalar bare mobility @xmath102 ( found , for example , by measuring the speed of a driven flat interface ) and the interfacial free energy @xmath7 and its derivatives . in the neighborhood of the point @xmath95 the normal @xmath99 is specified by its the deviations @xmath103 and @xmath104 from the normal at @xmath95 in the directions @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the free energy is a function of the normal @xmath99 and therefore , in the neighborhood of @xmath95 , a function of these angles @xmath107 .",
    "the reduced mobility tensor is then defined as @xmath108    since our kmc simulations show that the shape of a 3d shrinking grain is even closer to a sphere than a 2d shape to a circle , this reduced mobility tensor is nearly isotropic .",
    "this isotropy allows us to predict the 3d grain shrinking rate ( defined as the rate of change of the @xmath109 power of its volume @xmath110 ) by calculating the velocity @xmath111 of the shrinking grain boundary at the @xmath4 orientation .",
    "we will first estimate this velocity within the terrace - step - kink description of the vicinal surface .",
    "we then derive an exact expression for this velocity within the continuum limit .",
    "the low temperature interface can be described within the the terrace - step - kink ( tsk ) model @xcite .",
    "when steps are far apart , each step obeys the dynamics of a 2d grain .",
    "if the 3d grain is a sphere of radius @xmath113 , it is described near the @xmath4 orientation by a stack of circular terraces of increasing radii @xmath114 , @xmath115 , etc ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : terraces ] ) .",
    "because these steps are part of the spherical grain , they are related via @xmath116 solving this equation for @xmath117 , differentiating with respect to time and using the exact expression for the 2d grain shrinking rate @xmath118 we obtain @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , within the spherical grain approximation , the grain shrinking rate is @xmath120 which is in reasonable good quantitative agreement with the shrinking rate found by kmc simulations @xmath121 .",
    "little analytical progress in deriving equilibrium and kinetic properties of the 3d kim has been achieved to date .",
    "a mean field expression for the free energy of the tsk model neglecting step - step interaction was obtained by gruber and mullins @xcite .",

    "if we set the size of the 3d grain by choosing @xmath141 , we arrive at @xmath142 and hence ( again assuming a spherical shape to estimate the volume ) @xmath143 since the diameter of the self - similar shape at @xmath144 is slightly smaller than its diameter at @xmath145 , a better approximation would have been to scale @xmath146 in such a way that at the intermediate angle @xmath147 .",
    "in summary , using a kink - based description , we have derived directly from a microscopic model ( low temperature kim ) a continuum evolution equation for the anisotropic motion of a simple interface , and we have shown its equivalence to the standard phenomenological law of motion by curvature .",
    "we have illustrated with the example of dilute impurities that this kink - based kinetic description provides a useful framework for studying more complex situations . by extending this description to 3d , and by exploiting our 2d result for the self - similar dynamics of shrinking terraces",
    ", we have obtained the velocity of a curved interface near a singular orientation .",
    "we have shown that even though the interface stiffness tensor and the curvature tensor are singular at the @xmath5 orientation , their product , which determines the interface velocity , is smooth .",
    "furthermore , this velocity is consistent with the one predicted from the 3d tensorial generalization of the law for anisotropic curvature - driven motion using known expressions for the interface free energy and bare mobility .",
    "our kink - based derivation of a continuum equation of interface motion highlights the microscopic mechanism for the remarkable isotropy of the reduced mobility in both 2d and 3d and thus the shape of grains shrinking under the influence of capillarity alone .",
    "the reduced mobility is a product of the interfacial stiffness and the interfacial mobility both of which are strongly anisotropic .",
    "the isotropy of the reduced mobility is therefore a result of the cancellation of anisotropies of the interfacial stiffness and interfacial mobility .",
    "the microscopic reason for the cancellation is purely geometric in origin .",
    "the number of geometrically necessary kinks , and hence the configurational entropy of the interface , varies rapidly with inclination near low - energy / low - mobility orientations , but slowly near high - energy / high - mobility interfaces , where the density of kinks is high .",
    "since the leading order contribution to the interfacial stiffness comes from configurational entropy , stiffness is high where mobility is low and vice versa .",
    "the cancellation of anisotropies leads to roughly isotropic reduced mobility .",
    "therefore the shape of a shrinking grain can appear isotropic or anisotropic depending on whether driving forces other than capillarity are present .",
    "the bare mobility of the interface is , however , independent of the nature of the driving force .",
    "an interesting prospect for the future is to extend this kink - based theoretical description of interface motion to realistic , and more complex , grain boundaries where kinks have the character of dislocations .",
    "work along this line is presently in progress .",

    "in general , kinks comprising the grain boundary are characterized by their width @xmath148 , which is the distance of the closest approach of two neighboring kinks , their height @xmath149 , and the length of the steps of their random walk @xmath150 .",
    "for example , on square lattice , @xmath151 , the lattice constant and @xmath152 , while on a triangular lattice @xmath153 and @xmath154 . in the continuum limit",
    ", we define the density of kinks @xmath32 and seek its evolution equation in some fixed domain @xmath155 $ ] . since neighboring domains contain anti - kinks , absorbing boundary conditions must be imposed @xmath156 .",
    "a special case of this problem @xmath157 describes random walkers in 1d which can not occupy the same site . when a magnetic field is present , the random walk is biased and the problem can be mapped onto the well studied asymmetric exclusion process @xcite . to map the problem of finding the evolution of the kink density @xmath40 onto this special problem , we insert a space @xmath158 between each pair of adjacent kinks , as illustrated for a square lattice in fig .

    "each kink that leaves the @xmath126-domain , decreases the @xmath166-domain by @xmath168 .",
    "this implies that the boundaries of the @xmath166-domain move with a velocities proportional to the current of kinks our of the domain @xmath169 the equations for the motion of boundaries , together with the absorbing boundary conditions @xmath170 completely define the problem of diffusing kinks in the @xmath166-domain .    the mapping is inverted via @xmath171 at some fixed time we can write @xmath172 since both expressions give the number of kinks in the same physical interval . using we obtain @xmath173 this relationship allows us to invert to obtain @xmath174 it is now only a matter of carrying out the chain rule together with the boundary conditions and the transformation to obtain    [ eq : r_derivs ] @xmath175    thus we obtain the non - linear diffusion equation for @xmath32 which reads @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the flux of kinks in the fixed domain which vanishes at zero kink density .    using the relationship of the local slope and kink density @xmath178 and the expressions for the normal interface velocity and curvature @xmath179 we can compute the bare and the reduced mobilities from the normal velocity of the interface @xmath180 .",

    "the shrinking shape will remain self - similar if the radial velocity @xmath190 at each point of the boundary is proportional to the radius at that point .",
    "the normal velocity @xmath191 is the projection of the radial boundary velocity onto the normal direction .",
    "the curvature is the derivative of the slope with respect to the arc length @xmath192 thus , the condition of the self - similarity of the shrinking shape can be written as @xmath193 where @xmath194 is some proportionality constant . to complete the description we need to express the radius @xmath133 in terms of @xmath189 @xmath195 without loss of generality we set @xmath196 and integrate equations and together up to @xmath197 .",
