    "psr  j1713 + 0747 was discovered in a survey for millisecond pulsars ( msps ) with the 305  m areceibo radio telescope ( foster , wolszczan & camilo 1993 ) .",
    "it has been found that the pulsar has a spin period of 4.57 ms .",
    "systematic changes in the apparent pulsar period have indicated the binary nature of this object .",
    "foster et al .",
    "( 1993 ) made the first determination of the binary model parameters of psr  j1713 + 0747 .",
    "they found a nearly circular , 67.8  day binary orbit with a low mass white dwarf ( wd ) companion .",
    "they estimated the companion mass via the mass function . assuming the canonical value for the mass of the ns ( @xmath4  ) they set a lower limit of for the companion mass of @xmath5  .",
    "clearly , psr  j1713 + 0747 belongs to the family of neutron stars ( nss ) recycled by mass and angular momentum transfer from its normal ( donor ) companion ( alpar et al .",
    "this process leads to the formation of a msp together with a cool wd companion .",
    "for a recent review on this kind of binary systems see stairs ( 2004 ) .    psr  j1713",
    "+ 0747 has been continuously observed with an increasing degree of accuracy , which has been large enough to reveal the general relativistic effect known as shapiro delay .",
    "this occurs due to a slight change in the arrival time of pulsar radiation due to the curvature of space near the wd companion of the msp . according to general relativity ,",
    "pulses are retarded as they propagate through the gravitational potential well of the wd .",
    "the first detection of shapiro delay in psr  j1713 + 0747 is due to camilo , foster , & wolszczan ( 1994 ) .",
    "they were able to set lower limits of the masses of the wd ( @xmath6  0.27  ) and ns ( @xmath7  1.2  ) .    in a very recent work ,",
    "splaver et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have reported the results of twelve years of observations of psr  j1713 + 0747 .",
    "the timing data yielded a large improvement in the measurements of the shapiro delay that allowed for the determination of the individual masses for both components of the system . in principle shapiro delay yields @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the inclination angle . in practice ,",
    "unless @xmath11 , shapiro delay is highly covariant with @xmath12 is the orbital semi - major axis . ] in the timing model fit and hence difficult to measure .",
    "nevertheless , as shown by splaver et al ( 2005 ) , in the case of psr  j1713 + 0747 shapiro delay can be clearly distinguished .",
    "these high - precision detections allow for the masses of the pulsar and the companion star to be separately measured , being @xmath13  and @xmath14  .",
    "these authors repeat the statistical analysis of timing solutions , now combined with the theoretical orbital period - core mass relation , and they obtain a larger mass for the ns : @xmath15  ( 68 % confidence ) .",
    "the pulsar masses in systems that evolve into pulsar - wd binaries are expected to be larger that those in ns - ns binaries ( in this last case , the pulsar masses are expected within the range 1.25 - 1.44  ) .",
    "this is because the systems that evolve into pulsar - wd systems undergo extended periods of mass transfer . in a binary population study performed by thorsett & chakrabarty ( 1999 )",
    ", the authors find a narrow gaussian distribution with a mean of 1.35  and a width of 0.04  .",
    "the mass derived when the orbital period - core mass relation is imposed in psr j1713 + 0747 implies a significantly heavier ns . apart from psr  j1713 + 0747",
    "there are other msp  +  wd systems for which it has been possible to measure the shapiro delay and the masses of each component of the pair .",
    "one of them is psr  j0437 - 4715 ( van straten et al . 2001 ) for which @xmath16  , and @xmath17  .",
    "the other is psr  b1855 + 09 for which @xmath18  and @xmath19  for the pulsar mass ( kaspi et al .",
    "the uncertainties on all these measurements are large and the question of the distribution of pulsars masses in these systems remains open .",
    "one very important parameter is the characteristic age of the pulsar @xmath20 .",
    "the age of a spin - down powered pulsar is given by    @xmath21\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 is the pulsar period , @xmath23 the temporal derivative of the period , @xmath24 is the initial period and @xmath25 the braking index . for magnetic dipole radiation",
    "we have @xmath26 , and if we assume @xmath27 , the pulsar spin - down age is given by @xmath28 , the `` characteristic age '' of the pulsar .",
    "the uncertainty in the pulsar age is caused by @xmath25 and @xmath24 .",
    "on the other hand , the transverse velocity of the pulsar causes an apparent acceleration that contributes to the observed period derivative . ignoring this latter effect can lead to erroneous estimations of the characteristic pulsar age .",
    "splaver et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found for psr  j1713 + 0747 , @xmath29  gyr .",
    "using the restrictions for the mass of the wd in this system , hansen & phinney ( 1998 ) obtain cooling ages in the range 6.3 - 6.8 gyr , but if they consider the dispersion measure distance estimates , they can obtain cooling ages up to 13.2 gyr .",
    "if the pulsar has a close companion wd , we expect the cooling age for the wd to approximately match the age of the pulsar . for the kind of systems we are here interested in",
    ", @xmath20 should correspond to the age of the helium wd ( hereafter he  wd ) counted since the end of the main ( initial ) roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) episode .",
    "this is so because the initial rlof is the only one able to transfer the amount of matter needed to spin up the ns ( probably @xmath30  ) . as we shall show below , models of normal stars leading to the formation of the wd companion suffer from at least one hydrogen thermonuclear flash leading to a supplementary rlof",
    "however , these flash - driven rlofs are not relevant in spinning up the ns because of the tiny amount of transferred matter ( benvenuto & de vito 2004 ) .",
    "because of these reasons , the wd in psr  j1713 + 0747 should have spent a time of @xmath31  gyr since the end of the main rlof episode .",
    "the aim of this work is to test the present status of the theory of stellar evolution in binary systems by computing a set of evolutionary tracks in order to reproduce the main characteristics of the psr  j1713 + 0747 system , particularly the masses of the components , the orbital period and the characteristic timescale for the cooling of the wd . in our opinion",
    "this is an interesting problem because of the high precision of the measurements performed for the system we are dealing with .",
    "the wd companion of psr  j1713 + 0747 has been detected by lundgren , foster & camilo ( 1996 ) with hubble space telescope observations ( see table  [ table : observa ] ) .",
    "this fact provides us with the interesting possibility of confronting theory with observations . in doing",
    "so we shall employ the available observational data of the wd in psr  j1713 + 0747 as a test of the accuracy of our evolutionary calculations and _ not _ as the main data to account for .",
    "we shall do so because of two reasons .",
    "first , we judge that the accuracy of the radioastronomical measurements of the system is so high that they should be considered as the fundamental quantities for this problem .",
    "second , this procedure is interesting in order to gauge the ability of the binary stellar evolution theory combined with atmosphere models in predicting the characteristics of a wd and to evaluate the possibility of helping for a first optical detection of wds as companions of msps .",
    ".[table : observa ] main characteristics of the wd component of the psr  j1713 + 0747 system , taken from lundgren et al .",
    "the numbers in parentheses represent the uncertainty in the last digits quoted . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper we have computed a set of binary evolutionary tracks in order to account for the main characteristics of the psr  j1713 + 0747 system .",
    "we did so with a binary stellar evolution code including a non - grey treatment of the atmospheric layers .",
    "thanks to the high accuracy of the timing of this millisecond pulsar , it has been possible to measure the general relativistic shapiro delay effect to derive separate values for the masses of the white dwarf ( wd ) and the neutron star ( ns ) .",
    "starting out from this fact , we performed a numerical experiment in which we computed the full evolution of the system in order to account for the masses and orbital period of the system and _ then _ considered the evolutionary status of the wd .",
    "notice that the pulsar should have a characteristic age equal to the age of the wd counted since the end of the initial roche lobe overflow ( see section  [ sec : intro ] for further details ) .",
    "thus , at the characteristic age of the pulsar , the wd should resemble the object observed by lundgren et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "we found that a system with initial masses of @xmath32  , @xmath33  for the normal ( donor ) star and nss ( respectively ) in which the ns is able to accrete a fraction @xmath34 of the transferred mass ( the mass lost from the system is assumed to carry away a specific angular momentum equal to that of the ns ) accounts for the psr  j1713 + 0747 system if @xmath3 and @xmath35  d or @xmath36 and @xmath37  d. we did not try to compute detailed models with lower initial masses , because in such a case , the wd would need to spend a time in excess of the age of the universe in evolving to the observed configuration . also , at longer initial periods models would undergo a common envelope episode because of the very deep outer convective zone of the donor star at the onset of the roche lobe overflow .    in our opinion , it is remarkable that the model with @xmath38 accounts for the masses , the orbital period of the system and the brightness of the wd observed by lundgren et al .",
    "( 1996 ) at the correct age .",
    "we consider it as a successful fit which , in turn , indicates that the stellar evolution processes relevant for the present system are fairly well known .",
    "notice that we would have been able to predict the absolute magnitude of the wd in psr  j1713 + 0747 system with a reasonable accuracy .",
    "our models fit the main characteristics of the wd at the age corresponding to @xmath39  gyr given by splaver et al .",
    "consequently , we do not find evidence for a faster cooling as in hansen & phinney ( 1998 ) .",
    "however , as our models predict pure hydrogen atmospheres , they are unable to reproduce the colours measured by lundgren et al .",
    "( 1996 ) within the error bars of the observations . in any case",
    ", we should remark that this discrepancy is moderate since theory and observations differ in less than @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , the available photometric data is not yet accurate enough to determine a precise effective temperature and atmospheric chemical composition of the wd companion of the pulsar . in order to get a deeper understanding of the evolution of this system",
    "it would be essential to perform new spectroscopic and photometric observations .",
    "particularly , infra - red observations can offer much extra information and may help to constrain this binary further .",
