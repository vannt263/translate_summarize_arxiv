    "the bound magnetic polarons , single and molecule , represent the charge carrier quantum states formed when the magnetization fluctuations influence both their binding and a nontrivial thermal behavior .",
    "these states have been discussed in novel materials encompassing diluted magnetic semiconductors , @xcite ferromagnetic perovskites,@xcite and dilute ferromagnetic oxides.@xcite for example , the origin of ferromagnetism in diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) such as ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as , is intensively discussed in the recent years@xcite in view of their potential application in spintronics .",
    "the origin of ferromagnetism@xcite poses a very nontrivial question in view of the dominant role of antiferromagnetic superexchange in all of those materials when the carrier concentration is very low.@xcite therefore , it is crucial to describe these interactions accurately in the physically tractable situation .",
    "here we propose a soluble model of two interacting impurity electrons forming a bound magnetic - polaron molecule ( bmpm ) .",
    "magnetic interaction between a single electron located on a shallow impurity and the localized magnetic moments in diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) has been studied intensively for some time.@xcite@xmath2@xcite in the first period , the influence of classical fluctuations of magnetization on quantum states of the impurity electron have been analyzed.@xcite@xmath2@xcite , thus leading to the concept of bound magnetic polaron ( bmp ) .",
    "the main result obtained was to demonstrate that thermodynamic fluctuations suffice to produce a spontaneous spin splitting of the impurity states .",
    "a renewed interest in the present decade was stimulated by the possibility of ferromagnetic interpolaron interaction,@xcite@xmath2@xcite which would contribute in a fundamental manner to the origin and properties of ferromagnetic dms systems and other materials.@xcite@xmath2@xcite in ref .",
    "the authors extended the theory of single bmp@xcite@xmath2@xcite to the bipolaron case in the limit when the mutual interaction is represented by hopping of electrons between the two spatially separated impurities , that leads among others to the antiferromagnetic kinetic exchange between them.@xcite the magnetic cloud is represented then by an effective magnetic field , which is oriented arbitrarily and optimized , but its amplitude is a parameter of the approach.@xcite in the later version of the approach,@xcite the authors approximate the two - impurity wave function by piecewise constant values . they consider also a detailed thermodynamics of the resultant spin model and optimize the coupling parameters .",
    "the explicit solution is discussed in the limit of large interpolaron distance . due to complexity of the interacting bmp pair problem existing theories",
    "are still incomplete .",
    "for instance , the model developed by angelescu and bhatt@xcite of the system of two nonoverlapping polarons is analyzed via a generalized hubbard type hamiltonian with hopping ( matrix element @xmath3 ) and coulomb interaction ( energy @xmath4 ) turned on , is thought of as being complementary to the model of overlapping polaron pair of ref . .",
    "other important and still awaiting for solution problems are concerned with the acceptor type interacting bmp s in ii - vi and iii - v dms .",
    "recent achievements in understanding the ferromagnetism in these classes of materials clearly show importance of an accurate treating of the non - hydrogeniclike character of the hole wave function and its influence by the central cell corrections .",
    "@xcite@xmath2@xcite    in this paper we introduce and solve bmp molecule hamiltonian for the case of two donors .",
    "it is shown that our model unifies existing approaches to an interacting polaron pair : the wolff - bhatt - durst ( thereafter referred as to wbd ) model@xcite of overlapping polaron pair and the multiple - level generalized hubbard model of angelescu and bhatt ( thereafter referred as to ab ) with random fields@xcite .",
    "the wbd model is completed by providing whole microscopic justification of their hamiltonian parameters . while , the ab model of nonoverlapping , equal - magnitude and large polarons is generalized to the case of overlapping and arbitrary - magnitude interacting polaron pair , the extension is limited here only to the regular hubbard model ( i.e. within one lowest - energy level on each polaron site only ) .",
    "furthermore , we solve the resulting hamiltonian within the continuum - medium and the effective - mass approximations for the donor case . in this manner ,",
    "we extend the bmp model to the microscopic model of bmp molecule .",
    "this constitutes an accurate ground for the future analysis concerning acceptor - type bmp molecules and the polaron lattices .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we formulate our model of bmpm . in section iii",
    "we diagonalize the effective hamiltonian for the molecule . in section",
    "iv the thermodynamical properties are considered , whereas section v contains concluding remarks .",
    "the appendixes a and b provide details of analytic calculations .",
    "we start by considering two interacting bmps in dms with a random distribution of localized spins . within the continuum - medium and the effective - mass approximations , one can write hamiltonian in the form : @xmath5 + h_{ii}\\ ] ] @xmath6 @xmath7 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the impurity - electron effective mass , @xmath9 and @xmath10 label the two - impurity sites , @xmath11 label the two electrons , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are corresponding relative distances appearing in the problem , @xmath20 is the static dielectric constant , @xmath21 is the exchange integral of the contact fermi  ( s - d ) interaction between localized spins @xmath22 and those of impurity carriers , @xmath23 @xmath24 is the spin - density operator with the sum running over sites occupied by magnetic ions ( mn@xmath25 ) .",
    "@xmath26 is the hydrogen - molecule part which supplemented with the s - d coupling of electrons to localized spins ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the solution of bmp - pair problem is complex.@xcite@xmath2@xcite from one side , a systematic approach to the bmp lattices and hydrogen molecules can be achieved within the second - quantization formalism,@xcite but from the other , the spin part of @xmath28 is dependent on the positions of the localized - moment densites .",
    "this fact makes the problem more complex to solve .",
    "however , it becomes tractable when one tries to diagonalize @xmath28 as consisting of the hydrogeniclike molecule hamiltonian @xmath26 influenced by the perturbation @xmath29 this suggests to approach the solution of bmpm by selecting as trial states the eigenstates of the set of mutually compatible observables @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the total spin of the bmpm .",
    "in fact , as mobile carriers interact via an isotropic coulomb repulsion , only rotations of the whole molecule conserve their relative distance , thus leaving their energy unchanged .",
    "moreover , we know that in the heitler - london approximation the hamiltonian commutes with both @xmath32 and @xmath33 it is thus diagonal with three - fold degenerate triplet states .",
    "such an approach greatly simplifies the problem , as in practice we have solutions for @xmath26 within the eigenstates of @xmath34 here we consider more general than heitler - london solution of the hydrogen molecule by including also ionic configurations . in this case",
    ", @xmath26 is not diagonal in the basis formed from eigenstates of @xmath35 and @xmath36 fortunately , for the off - diagonal elements , the hopping couples only the different singlet states .",
    "next , we express @xmath27 in terms of the creation and annihilation operators .",
    "details of calculations of the matrix representation of @xmath27 within the first quantization formalism are presented in appendix a. our methodology bases on an explicit demonstration that the postulated occupation - number representation of the polaronic part of the bmpm hamiltonian leads to the same expectation values as those obtained within the first quantization scheme .",
    "thus , we assume @xmath27 in the following form : @xmath37 where @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for the state on impurity @xmath40 with the spin @xmath41 @xmath42 and the polaron exchange fields @xmath43 are defined as : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the local magnetization per unit volume ; @xmath46 is number of atoms per unit volume containing fraction @xmath47 of magnetic atoms , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the orthogonal molecular wave functions : @xmath50 ,   \\label{4}\\ ] ] which are build from the single - particle atomic wave functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 being the solution of the corresponding single - particle hydrogeniclike schrdinger equation with the effective bohr radius a@xmath53 @xmath54  and @xmath55 are the mixing coefficients : @xmath56 ^{1/2},\\quad \\gamma = \\frac{s}{1+\\sqrt{1-s^{2 } } } ,   \\label{5}\\ ] ] determined by imposing the ortogonality and the normalization conditions , whereas @xmath57 is the overlap integral .",
    "it is important to note here , that when calculating @xmath58 we replaced the spin density operator @xmath59 by its quantum mechanical average , thereby introducing the adiabatic and mean field approximations .",
    "this however is acceptable here , because the same approximations are assumed in the single bmp theory and provide good results.@xcite the bmp s exchange fields @xmath60 and @xmath61 may be oriented in an arbitrary direction and we do not make any a priori restriction for their magnitude . in our model",
    "those polaronic exchange fields are overlapping , through the presence of the mixing coefficients in the definition of @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "next , we introduce the six eigenstates of the carriers total spin operator @xmath62 : three triplet ( @xmath63 ) and three singlet ( @xmath64 ) states.@xcite  the triplet states are : @xmath65 @xmath66 and the corresponding three singlet states are : @xmath67 @xmath68 and @xmath69 it is also more convenient to transform the bmp exchange fields @xmath70 and @xmath61 to @xmath71 and @xmath72 according to following prescriptions : @xmath73 which enable us to write the effective polaron fields as : @xmath74=\\frac{\\alpha } { g\\mu _ { b}}\\int d^{3}r[\\left| w_{a}(r)\\right| ^{2}\\pm \\left| w_{b}(r)\\right| ^{2}]\\mathbf{m}% ( r )",

    "this choice leads to the following @xmath78 singlet - triplet matrix representation of @xmath27 : @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are respectively , the azimuthal and the polar angles between the exchange field @xmath71 and @xmath82    for the solution of the bmpm problem , the polaronic part @xmath27 must be completed with the hydrogenlike molecule part @xmath83 written also in the second quantization form .",
    "such representation of @xmath26 is known@xcite@xmath84@xcite so , we can write it directly as : @xmath85,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where , @xmath86 is the atomic level position , @xmath3 the hopping between the impurity states and @xmath87 the intra - atomic coulomb interaction .",
    "the remaining terms represent respectively , the interatomic ( heisenberg ) exchange , the pair hopping , and the so - called correlated hopping . in the singlet - triplet basis",
    ", @xmath26 has relatively simple form@xcite , so we may write : @xmath88 where : @xmath89 for identical impurities both the atomic level positions @xmath90 and @xmath91 and the intra - atomic coulomb interactions @xmath92 and @xmath93 are equal ( i.e. @xmath94 @xmath95 and @xmath96 @xmath97 ) .",
    "we note here , that @xmath26 is solved in the local coordinate system , with @xmath98 axis aligned with the direction of the molecular bond , and then hamiltonian @xmath26 is reoriented towards the global quantization axis .",
    "this last step is quite trivial due to the rotational invariance of @xmath99 .",
    "having determined the bmp molecule hamiltonian , we discuss next its relation to the with existing models of angelescu - bhatt ( ab ) and wolff  bhatt - durst ( wbd).@xcite@xmath2@xcite these earlier models of interacting bmp pair , while being significant theoretical achievements , are subject to certain important limitations , clearly stated by their authors . here , for a purpose of completeness , we enumerate some of them . as in our model",
    "each site contributes a single s - type orbital , the ab model appears as more advanced , because it accounts for excited - states transitions from 1s level up to 3d level .",
    "nevertheless , it should be kept in mind , that ab model treats bmps as nonoverlapping , equal and large field within the perturbatoion approach with respect to their mutual interaction , hence neglecting important processes even in the simplest one - level situation .",
    "for instance , ab model does not predict ferromagnetic ground state in that case .",
    "their assumption about equal magnitudes of bmps exchange fields creates a serious problem with treating them as thermodynamically fluctuating quantities . from the other side , trusting in predictions from wbd model is weakened by not fully microscopic derivation of their hamiltionian , including their parameters .",
    "and @xmath100 as a function of interimpurity distance @xmath19 expressed in the units of @xmath101,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig1 ]    therefore , it is important to recognize consequences of such approximations , even in a relatively simplest case . in this work",
    "the model is formulated as applicable beyond those limits namely , our bmps are overlapping , have arbitrary magnitude of the exchange fields and their mutual interaction is accounted for within molecular formalism .",
    "moreover , we are able to consider also thermodynamics , including thermal fluctuations of bmps exchange fields .",
