    "fusion of two atomic nuclei is possible if they approach each other to a short distance ( @xmath1 cm ) . to come that close , they need to go through a coulomb barrier of the height of few mev .",
    "the penetration probability for such a barrier at room temperature ( energy of relative motion @xmath2mev ) is practically zero ( @xmath3 @xcite ) , but this probability rapidly grows when the kinetic energy of the nuclei increases .",
    "for example , for the @xmath4 system at the energy of 30kev the penetration probability becomes @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the obvious way to fuse the nuclei is to raise the temperature of their mixture . in this way",
    "the so called thermo - nuclear reactions happen in the stellar bodies , in nuclear weapons , and in the tokamak@xcite .",
    "+ alternatively , the nuclei ( which we want to fuse ) can be put in a bound system such as a molecule , where they sit next to the barrier relatively long . in such a case , even at zero relative energy , the nuclei are separated by a thinner barrier . for example , the two deuterons sitting at rest near each other at a distance of @xmath6 , have to overcome the same barrier as two free moving deuterons with relative energy of @xmath7ev ( which is equivalent to the temperature of @xmath8 ) .",
    "+ this , however , does not help much . for a deuterium molecule @xmath9 in its ground state",
    "the penetration probability is still too low , namely , @xmath10 @xcite and the fusion rate is @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "these numbers can be significantly increased if we make the size of the molecule smaller .",
    "this can be achieved if one electron in the molecule is replaced with the muon , which is approximately 200 times heavier . as a result ,",
    "the nuclei find themselves at a distance that is 200 times smaller @xcite . for the deuterons ,",
    "the thickness of the barrier becomes the same as at the collision energy almost equal to 3kev ( this corresponds to the temperature of @xmath12 ) .",
    "+ this is already a significant gain .",
    "the penetration probability for the muonic molecule @xmath13 is @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "with such a probability , one muon can help to fuse , i.e. can catalyze the fusion of many nuclear pairs before it decays ( muon lifetime is @xmath15s ) .",
    "the muon - catalyzed fusion has been observed and well studied both experimentally and theoretically ( see , for example , refs.@xcite ) , but turned out to be inefficient as a new source for the energy production .",
    "+ in the present paper , we suggest and experimentally explore yet another possible approach to fusion of light nuclei . the idea is to make a crystal out of the atoms",
    "whose nuclei we want to fuse . in this crystal ,",
    "the nuclei sit next to each other at an atomic distance and oscillate around the equilibrium positions .",
    "a crystal is just a huge molecule and of course the probability of spontaneous fusion of neighbouring nuclei is negligible , the same as in the ordinary molecules .",
    "an experiment aimed to observe the spontaneous fusion in the lithium deuteride crystal put an upper bound on the fusion rate per nuclear pair as @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "+ however , we can try to shake the crystalline lattice by an external force ( electromagnetic wave , for example ) .",
    "the nuclei swayed around their equilibrium positions , acquire kinetic energy relative to each other . as a result , the original boltzmann distribution of the nuclei over the oscillation levels is changing and the higher levels are populated . from these higher energy levels",
    "the nuclei can tunnel through the coulomb barrier and fuse .",
    "this is what we observed when irradiated the lid crystal with the x - rays .",
    "the rate of such a fusion turned out to be very low ( one event every half an hour ) , but still easily measurable .",
    "the nuclei we want to fuse , are the isotopes of hydrogen and lithium , namely , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "their compound nucleus , @xmath19 , has no stable states .",
    "the threshold energies for its spontaneous disintegration in various pairs of fragments are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.8be_spectrum ] ( the data are taken from ref .",

    "this is above the thresholds for all the other two - body channels , namely , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "+ when sitting at the nodes of a crystalline lattice , the nuclei oscillate around their equilibrium positions , but the oscillation energy is negligible on the nuclear scale .",
    "they therefore can be considered as being at rest relative to each other .",
    "in other words , the nuclear pair @xmath27 in a crystal is practically at the threshold energy .",
    "+ if @xmath20 and @xmath18 in the crystal , overcome huge coulomb barrier and fuse , then there is no way back for them .",
    "indeed , for the resulting excited ( resonant ) state @xmath28 to decay back into the channel @xmath29 , the deuteron and lithium nuclei must overcome the same huge coulomb barrier , while they have practically zero relative kinetic energy .",
    "it is much more easier to decay into one of the channels whose thresholds are below and where the kinetic energy is above the coulomb barrier .",
    "for example , in the channel @xmath30 ( which lies @xmath31 below the ground state of the compound nucleus ) the relative kinetic energy is greater than in the @xmath27 channel by the amount of @xmath32 , i.e. is always well above the barrier .",

    "( [ channels ] ) with the energy release shown for each channel .",
    "+ around the @xmath34-threshold , the compound nucleus @xmath19 has several very wide and overlapping meta - stabele states ( resonances ) .",
    "the one that is located most closely to the threshold , has the quantum numbers : ( total spin and parity ) @xmath35 , ( isospin ) @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "this wide state is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.8be_spectrum ] as a strip of verdical bars .",
    "+ recent analysis of experimental data , based on the @xmath39-matrix parametrization  @xcite , showed that at the near - threshold energies the inelastic collision of @xmath20 and @xmath18 mainly leads to formation of that resonance @xmath40 .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite also showed that this resonance predominantly decays into the @xmath41-channel .",
    "they found that the partial width for such a decay is @xmath42 , which gives @xmath43 .",
    "in other words , after its formation , this resonance decays in the @xmath41-channel with the probability of 96% .",
    "+ ignoring the remaining 4% , we can assume that , if the fusion of our @xmath20 and @xmath18 happens , almost the only outcome is the @xmath41 pair , @xmath44 the resulting @xmath45-particles equally share the energy and momentum .",
    "therefore the fusion event could be identified by detecting at least one of the two @xmath45-particles moving in the opposite directions with the energies of @xmath46 .",
    "nuclear reactions at extremely low energies ( @xmath47 ) are significantly suppressed by the repelling coulomb forces . the probability @xmath48 that the colliding nuclei tunnel through the coulomb barrier is equal to the ratio @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the wave function of their relative motion at the distance @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the classical turning point .",

    "within its cell , a nucleus moves to and fro , periodically colliding with the barriers .",
    "each of these collisions is an attempt to tunnel through . if the size of the cell is @xmath60 and velocity of the nucleus is @xmath61 , then the attempts are repeated with the period @xmath62 , i.e. with the frequency @xmath63 .",
    "+ therefore , the number of transitions through the barrier per second ( i.e. the transition rate ) is @xmath64 . as we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec.fusionchannels ] , if the deuteron ( or @xmath18 ) manages to pass to the other side of the barrier , there is no way back ( for that , it needs to tunnel once more through the same barrier , while the penetration probability is very small ) .",
    "this means that if the penetration takes place , the nuclear system ends up in one of the inelastic channels given by eq .",
    "( [ channels ] ) . among these channels ,",
    "the reaction ( [ dli6to2alpha ] ) has the highest probability , @xmath65 . therefore , if a deuteron in the crystal oscillates with the energy @xmath66 , the reaction ( [ dli6to2alpha ] ) happens with the rate @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the mass of deuteron .",
    "apparently , the same is valid for the tunneling of a lithium nucleus , and the corresponding reaction rate @xmath69 can be obtained in the same way .",
    "lithium hydride is an ionic crystal with simple cubic structure . in each pair of @xmath70 and @xmath71 atoms ,",
    "one electron is transferred from the lithium to the deuterium . as a result ,",

    "there are three orthogonal axes along which the deuteron moves in such a potential . in order to fuse with @xmath18 ,",
    "the deuteron have to tunnel through one of the six potential barriers surrounding it .",
    "+ the height @xmath74 of the barrier can be estimated as the coulomb repulsion energy of the charges @xmath75 and @xmath76 at the distance @xmath77 , where @xmath78fm  @xcite and @xmath79fm  @xcite are the nuclear radii of the deuteron and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "this gives @xmath80 apparently , the central minimum of the potential shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.crystal.pot ] , is not the same as the zero potential energy for an isolated @xmath27 pair .",

    "+ if @xmath81 is the distance between the nuclei @xmath20 and @xmath18 in the crystal  @xcite , and @xmath82 is the shift of the deuteron from its equilibrium position , then the coulomb forces acting on it from the neighbouring lithium nuclei , generate the potential energy : @xmath83 at the equilibrium point ( @xmath84 ) the potential is @xmath85 this is how much the deuteron in the crystal is lifted up against the free - space coulomb barrier . actually , the deuteron energy is even a bit higher .",
    "this additional energy , however , is associated with the thermal oscillations and therefore is small , namely , of the order of @xmath86 , i.e. @xmath87 at room temperature .",
    "+ the deuteron sitting in the central well of the potential shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.crystal.pot ] , oscillates around its equilibrium point . in order",
    "to estimate the fusion rate , we need to know the energy levels ( spectrum ) of its oscillations , as well as the distribution of the statistical ensemble of the deuterons over these levels . for the estimation purpose",
    ", this problem can be simplified if we approximate the central well by another potential for which both the spectrum and wave functions are known analytically .",
    "+ looking at fig .  [ fig.crystal.pot ] , one might guess that the best approximation would be a parabola , i.e. a harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "this however is wrong because the curve shown in that figure is schematic .",
    "actually , if we accurately plot the function ( [ vx2coulombs ] ) on the interval @xmath88 , it is practically flat everywhere except for the left and right ends of this interval , where it quickly raises to @xmath74 .",
    "the reason is that @xmath89 is too large as compared to the range of distances where the coulomb potential is comparable with @xmath74 .",
    "actual potential - well looks as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.crystal.pot.actual ] , where we removed the central part , which is long and almost flat .",
    "+ of course , in addition to the coulomb fields generated by the nuclei , there are also electric fields due to the electron shells of the ions . however , these fields are weak as compared to the height @xmath90 of the coulomb barriers . indeed , the binding energy of an electron to the nucleus ( and therefore of the nucleus to the shell ) in a hydrogen atom is @xmath91 , which is five orders of magnitude smaller than the height of the barrier .",
    "the reason of relative weakness of the electron field in the crystal is that , in contrast to the nuclei , the electrons act not as point - like charges but as a space charge of the electron cloud distributed within a volume of few angstrom size .",
    "+ for the purpose of estimating , we can assume that the electron cloud is a uniformly charged sphere .",
    "for a charge @xmath92 , the interaction potential with the charge @xmath93 uniformly distributed within a sphere of radius @xmath39 , is ( see eq .",
    "( 2 - 104 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath94 where @xmath51 is the distance of charge @xmath92 from the centre of the sphere .",
    "if we assume ( for the sake of estimating ) that the electron shell of the ion @xmath72 is a uniformly charged sphere ( @xmath95 ) of the radius @xmath96 ( @xmath97 : see fig .  [ fig.crystal.plane ] )",
    ", then the strongest attraction ( at @xmath98 ) for the deuteron from its own electron shell is @xmath99 . in other words , the bottom of the potential shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.crystal.pot.actual ] , is not exactly flat . at its centre , it has an additional shallow `` dent '' ( potential well ) of the depth @xmath100 , which is spherically spread to a distance of @xmath101 .",
    "+    similarly , within the electron cloud of the @xmath73 ion , there is another `` dent '' on the potential curve of the depth @xmath102 ( because the radius of this cloud is half of the deuterium radius ) .",
    "therefore the potential energy of the deuteron nucleus in the crystal ( along the line connecting two neighbouring lithium nuclei ) looks like is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.crystal.vde ] .",
    "+ it should be noted that despite its depth , the bottom of the lithium `` dent '' is a bit higher relative to the deuterium one because it is superimposed on the center of the coulomb repulsion .",
    "it is clear that such a superposition slightly reduces both the height and the thickness of the coulomb barrier . of course the curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.crystal.vde ] , is an exaggeration .",
    "actual depths of the `` dents '' are five orders of magnitude smaller than the height @xmath74 of the barrier .",
    "this means that , if plotted correctly , actual curve looks practically as a square - well potential of the depth @xmath74 and width @xmath103 .",
    "it should be emphasized that we can only ignore the electron `` dents '' when consider the motion of the deuteron along any of the three orthogonal lines , i.e. directly towards one of the neighbouring lithium nuclei , and when the excitations are @xmath104 . in all other directions and at lower oscillation energies the central `` dent '' is important because it holds the deuteron in its place .",
    "+ therefore , a good approximation for the potential @xmath105 is a square well .",
    "moreover , we can replace it with an infinitely deep square well , because the excitations that we are going to consider ( @xmath106 ) are very small as compared to @xmath107 .",
    "the advantage of using the infinite square well is that we know both the spectrum and wave functions for such a potential analytically : @xmath108 where @xmath68 is the deuteron mass .",
    "apparently , everything that was said about the potential well for the deuteron , is valid for the lithium nucleus as well .",
    "the only parameter that is different in such a case , is the mass of the nucleus .",
    "the ground - state energies for both nuclei in the corresponding potential wells are very low , namely , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the excitation levels are very dense . on the interval @xmath111\\,\\mathrm{kev}$ ] there are 12,746 and 22,030 levels for the deuteron and @xmath18 , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.levels ] ) .      as we have seen , in the lithium deuteride crystal the deuteron is effectively lifted up against the coulomb barrier to the energy of @xmath112 .",
    "this gives for the exponential ( gamow ) factor in eq .",
    "( [ psipsiratio ] ) a negligible value , @xmath113 such a small value means that the spontaneous fusion in the crystal ( although is possible in principle ) is far beyond our capacity to detect it .",

    "as it follows from the theoretical estimate ( see previous section ) , the fusion events we are looking for , are rare ( roughly , one event every half an hour ) .",
    "this fact determines the sample design and the choice of the way of registering the events .",
    "the low rate of the reaction implies that we need to expose the sample to the x - rays for a relatively long time ( at least a hundred hours ) to get a statistically meaningful result",
    ". the detector should be able to efficiently distinguish the fusion events from all possible background signals and to accumulate the information during whole exposure period .",
    "+ based on this , we used the polymer track detectors cr-39 in direct contact with the active material ( lithium hydride ) .",
    "each fusion event results in a pair of @xmath45-particles moving in the opposite directions with the same energy of @xmath46 .",
    "these particles leave tracks in the polymer material , which can be identified after the experiment is completed . since only few hundred events are expected , the probability that different tracks overlap each other is practically zero .",
    "the background tracks left by other charged particles , can be easily excluded using specific properties of the tracks belonging to the @xmath45-particles from the fusion events ( see sec .",
    "[ sec.detectors ] ) .",
    "lithium hydride ( @xmath193 ) is a solid crystalline compound , usually available in the form of chunks or powder .",
    "it is extremely hygroscopic , absorbing water from the air , via the chemical reaction @xmath194 for our experiment , this is a destructive process and therefore we avoided the contacts of @xmath193 with atmospheric air by all available means .",
    "all the manipulations with the crystals were done in an anaerobic chamber ( glove - box ) filled with dry @xmath195 gas . besides that , some desiccants were present in the chamber .",
    "+    the crystalline chunks were ground into powder form .",
    "this powder was placed between square plates ( @xmath196 each ) of the plastic detectors ( cr-39 ) , as is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.slojka ] .",
    "we put in parallel several units like the one shown in this figure , and the whole assembly was enclosed in a hermetic pvc container .",
    "the total number of the detector plates was 85 .",
    "+ the lithium hydride we used , was not pure @xmath197-compound .",
    "the isotope composition of lithium atoms was practically natural , namely , 92.41% of @xmath198 and 7.59% of @xmath199 .",
    "as far as the hydrogen atoms are concerned , the substance was enriched with deuterium up to 98% .      to generate the x - rays , we used a xylon y.tu 225-d02 tube .",
    "the tube was operated with a potential difference of 100kv and the current of 30ma . in order to find out what was the spectrum of the rays",
    ", we used available data for the spectrum of this source , measured at the same voltage , but with a much lower current , namely , @xmath200 , and at a different distance .",
    "we simply scaled these data to actual current and distance , used in our experiment .",
    "+ the length of our sample was 13.2 cm .",
    "passing through the sample , the x - rays attenuate both because of interaction with the material and because of spreading ( the rays are not collinear ) . as a result",
    "the intensity of the radiation is not uniform through the sample . in our theoretical estimate",
    ", we used average intensity of the x - rays in the sample . the corresponding spectrum ( obtained by scaling the original data and averaging them )",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.xspectrum ] .",
    "we identify the fusion events by registering the @xmath45-particles that emerge from the decay of the resulting @xmath201 resonance . however , there are other ( background ) sources of @xmath45-particles that might be distorting our counting . among them",
    "the most common is radon ( and its decay products ) that is present practically everywhere .",
    "in addition to that , our measurements were done at the premises of necsa ( nuclear energy corporation south africa ) near pretoria , where a nuclear reactor was operating .",
    "although an appropriate radiation shielding was used , we can not exclude that some thermal neutrons from the reactor could reach our sample and generate @xmath45-particles in collisions with @xmath18 via the reaction @xmath202    our detectors were kept isolated from the atmospheric air all the time . and",
    "since @xmath45-particles can not penetrate through a plastic container , we can safely ignore the possibility of counting false events due to radon and its progeny .",
    "the only source of possible false events is the reaction ( [ neutron ] ) .",
    "however , the @xmath45-particles from the fusion events have a much higher energy ( 11.1mev ) than those from this reaction .",
    "this fact provides us with a reliable way of distinguishing the fusion and false events .",
    "when analysing the detectors , we only counted the tracks left by particles with the energy higher than 6mev ( for the details see sec .",
    "[ sec.detectors ] ) .",
    "the fusion events were registered by identifying the appropriate tracks left by @xmath45-particles in the solid state nuclear track detectors cr-39 .",
    "original tracks are very narrow channels where the structure of the plastic material is damaged by the particle .",
    "these channels become much wider and visible under a microscope magnification , after etching . for etching",
    ", we used a 6.25 mol/@xmath203 solution of naoh at 70 @xmath204c . +",
    "this solution removes the plastic material not only from the channels , but from all the surfaces .",
    "however the rate of etching at the damages is higher .",
    "there are certain empirical formulae that enable one to calculate the etching rates at various conditions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "it is therefore possible to numerically model the shapes of the tracks for different etching times .",
    "for such a modelling , we used the standard code track_test developed by the authors of ref .",
    "+    depending on its kinetic energy , the @xmath45-particle penetrates into the plastic material and damages it to a certain depth ( typically a dozen of microns ) . when etched , such a track forms a pit in the shape of a sharp cone , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.tracks](a ) .",
    "the longer we etch it , the deeper and wider this cone becomes .",
    "this goes on until the depth of the pit becomes equal to the penetration length .",
    "after that the pit only becomes wider and retains practically the same depth . as a result , the bottom of the pit transforms from a sharp cone to a smooth spherically concave surface , as is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.tracks](b ) .",
    "+ the sharp cone and concave shapes have different optical properties .",
    "a smooth concave surface reflects the light and even focus it to a small dot , which is not possible for a sharp cone .",
    "therefore just looking into the etched tracks , we can distinguish `` finished '' ( track end has been reached ) and `` unfinished '' tracks . using the track_test software , we can calculate the length of the track for any given energy @xmath205 of the @xmath45-particle as well as calculate the depth of the pit for a given etching time @xmath150 .",
    "therefore we can choose @xmath150 such that all the tracks for @xmath205 higher than certain threshold @xmath206 , form sharp cone pits , while for @xmath207 the pits reflect the light .",
    "+ since we need to exclude the tracks resulted from the reaction ( [ neutron ] ) , where the maximal energy is 4.78mev , we could choose the threshold energy to be 5mev .",
    "however , to be absolutely sure , we used @xmath208 .",
    "this corresponds to etching time @xmath209hours .",
    "after the etching , we looked for completely dark pits ( sharp cones ) with certain diameter of the opening .",
    "these tracks could not be done by anything else but the @xmath45-particles from the fusion reaction .",
    "it should be noted that we can not register all the fusion events that occur in the sample .",
    "first of all , the @xmath45-particles from the reactions that take place far away from a detector plate , can not reach the detector because the distance they can go through in any solid media is very short .",
    "moreover , even if they reach a detector surface from afar , they loose a significant part of the kinetic energy and thus can not be registered if the remaining energy is less than @xmath208 .",
    "+ our calculations show that in the lithium - hydride the original energy of 11.1mev of the @xmath45-particle is reduced to the minimally acceptable energy of 6mev on the distance of @xmath210 mm .",
    "this means that , when we count the events , we can only register the events happening within a thin layer of the lithium - hydride of 0.095 mm thickness , which is in contact with the detector .",
    "since in total we have 85 detectors and for each of them the surface area in contact with lih is 0.95@xmath2110.95@xmath212 ( most of them have lih on both sides ) , the total volume of lih , from which we register the @xmath45-particles , is 0.77@xmath213 and the corresponding mass is 0.61 g .",
    "this effective mass of the active material was used in our theoretical estimate of the fusion rate .",
    "+ this is not the end of the story . the efficiency of the detection is reduced further by the fact that the @xmath45-particles are emitted isotropically in all directions .",
    "for example , if the fusion event happens at the maximal acceptable distance from the detector and the @xmath45-particle moves at a non - zero angle relative to the normal to the detector surface , the actual distance it has to pass in lih is greater than the @xmath214 and thus it looses too much energy .",
    "similar losses take place at any distance within the thin layer , when the angle is too large .",
    "moreover , the tracks with the angle to the normal greater that @xmath215 can not be identified using our simple method . + estimating all possible losses , we conclude that we can only register of about 40% of the events happening in 0.61 g of the material .",
    "this means that from the number of detected events we can only derive a lower bound for the reaction rate .",
    "this is sufficient for a first and simple experiment .",
    "actually , the main goal of our experiment was to establish if the fusion in the crystal could be induced by x - rays or not .",
    "the sample composed of alternating layers of lithium - hydride and the plastic detector - plates ( as is described in sec .  [ sec.sample_preparation ] ) , was exposed to the x - ray radiation for the duration of 111.466 hours .",
    "then , after the etching of the detectors , we identified ( in total on all 85 plates ) 88 tracks that belonged to the @xmath45-particles from the fusion reaction ( [ dli6to2alpha ] ) . since we could not register all the fusion events ( some of them were missing as is explained in sec .",
    "[ sec.efficiency ] ) , actual number @xmath216 of the events ( happened in 0.61 g of lih ) is greater , @xmath217 . taking into account that the substance we used was not pure lithium - deuteride ( see sec .",
    "[ sec.fusion_induced_x ] for explanations ) , we conclude that under the used electromagnetic radiation ( the spectrum is given in fig .",
    "[ fig.xspectrum ] ) the fusion rate for a single @xmath218 pair is @xmath219 this result is of the same order of magnitude as was predicted by our theoretical estimate ( [ 2body_rates ] ) .",
    "the total number of events @xmath220 , theoretically expected for our experimental conditions and duration , is in accordance with the actual observation , @xmath217 .",
    "+ apparently , the fusion rate turned out to be too low for any possible applications of this process in the energy production .",
    "however , the electromagnetically induced nuclear reactions in crystals can be used in a different way . in principle , this offers a new way of measuring the cross sections ( or the astrophysical s - factors ) of such reactions ( not only fusion ) at extremely low energies , which are not accessible in the direct collision experiments .",
    "+ of course , such an approach would require a more rigorous theoretical description of all the processes involved .",
    "in particular , the electron screening has to be taken into account in a proper way",
    ". this could be done by appropriately modifying the barrier penetration factor and using an accurate model ( instead of the square well ) for the potential schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.crystal.vde ] .",
    "there is no doubt that taking into account the electron clouds is not an easy task .",
    "indeed , the configuration of their space charge is dynamically changing when the nuclei move . it is therefore needed some theoretical effort before the nuclear reactions in crystals could be used for measuring the corresponding cross sections at low energies .",
    "+ at present , the only alternative to the direct collision experiments at low energies is the so called `` trojan horse '' method , where the projectile is carried to the close proximity of the target as a cluster inside another nucleus ( the `` horse '' ) .",
    "this `` horse '' may have the kinetic energy well above the coulomb barrier and thus neither its penetrability nor the screening effects play any role .",
    "when near the target , the projectile is detached from the `` horse '' and interacts with the target at a low energy while practically all the original kinetic energy is taken away by the `` empty horse '' ( see @xcite , and the references therein ) .",
    "+ although in the `` trojan horse '' method the complicated screening effects are avoided , it still relies on an involved theoretical analysis .",
    "therefore , an additional experimental method for determining the s - factors would be of help .",
    "the `` trojan horse '' and the crystal methods would complement each other .",
    "+ experimentally , the main advantage of using crystals is the fact that here the effective flux of the nuclei is extremely dense . indeed ,",
    "roughly the avogadro number of projectiles collide with the avogadro number of target nuclei .",
    "with such a density ( as we have seen in our experiment ) even the reactions with very low probabilities can be observed . in order to narrow the interval of the collision energies",
    ", a synchrotron radiation can be used instead of the x - rays .",
