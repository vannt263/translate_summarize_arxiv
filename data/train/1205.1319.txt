    "the transition dynamics in a quantum two - level system with a time - dependent hamiltonian varying such that the energy separation of the two diabatic states is a linear function of time is a central problem since the early days of quantum mechanics .",
    "it is commonly denoted as the landau - zener ( lz ) problem , although it has been solved independently by landau @xcite , zener @xcite , stckelberg @xcite and majorana @xcite in 1932 ( for a more detailed discussion of the differences between the four approaches , we refer the interested reader to a paper by di giacomo and nikitin @xcite ) .",
    "nonadiabatic transitions at avoided level crossings are at the heart of many dynamical processes throughout physics and chemistry .",
    "they have been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally in , e.g. , spin flips in nanomagnets @xcite , solid state artificial atoms @xcite , nanocircuit qed @xcite , adiabatic quantum computation @xcite , the dynamics of chemical reactions @xcite , and in bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "also the nonequilibrium dynamics of glasses at low temperatures is dominated by the transition dynamics of avoided level crossings  @xcite .    in the pure landau - zener problem ,",
    "two quantum states interact by a constant tunneling matrix element @xmath0 .",
    "a control parameter is swept through the avoided level crossing at a constant velocity @xmath1 , such that the energy gap between the two diabatic states depends linearly on time .",
    "the landau - zener problem addresses the case when the system starts in the lower energy eigenstate in the infinite past and asks for the probability of finding the system in the lower energy eigenstate in the infinite future ( a landau - zener transition ) .",
    "certainly , for infinitely slow variation of the energy difference @xmath2 , the adiabatic theorem states that no transition between energy eigenstates will occur , since at any moment of time , the system will always be in an instantaneous eigenstate of the hamiltonian . for @xmath3 ,",
    "the probability @xmath4 for no transition  @xcite is described by the landau - zener formula @xcite @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "most experimental investigations , on the one hand , actually deal with more complex systems than two - state systems and , on the other hand , do not necessarily start in the ground state . in close proximity around the avoided crossing in most cases",
    "only the two crossing states are important to describe the dynamics .",
    "however , in general in such an approximate system we also have to deal with the system being initially in the excited state . in the pure landau - zener problem the probability to end up in the ground ( excited ) state when starting in the ground ( excited ) state are identical due to symmetry .",
    "however , in any physical realization , a quantum system is influenced by its environment leading to relaxation and phase decoherence during time evolution @xcite . at low temperatures",
    "when the environmental fluctuations are not thermally occupied , the landau - zener probability @xmath6 ( to end up in the ground state when starting in the ground state ) should hardly be influenced since no phonons are available for the system to be in the excited state at asymptotically long times .",
    "however , spontaneous emission is possible even at lowest temperatures and the excitation survival probability @xmath7 ( to end up in the excited state when starting in the excited state ) is expected to decrease when the system has the time to relax during the driving . thus especially at low driving speeds , the excitation survival probability will be reduced since the system will decay , while the pure landau - zener mechanism predicts full survival of excitations when driving through an avoided crossing at low speeds .",
    "the dissipative landau - zener problem received a lot of attention  @xcite in the past 25 years due to its relevance for controlled quantum state preparation which became experimentally feasible in many physical realizations .",
    "although the full problem is analytically unsolved , many limiting cases are analytically tractable and numerical approaches are available",
    ". usually a dissipative environment causes fluctuations of the energies of the diabatic states ( longitudinal or diagonal system - bath coupling ) but occasionally the environments can also cause transitions between the diabatic states ( transversal system bath coupling ) . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the more common case of longitudinal coupling .",
    "the transversal coupling has been treated in refs .",
    "@xcite for zero temperature .    in the limit of very fast sweeps ( nonadiabatic driving )",
    ", a thermal heat bath has been shown not to influence the landau - zener probability .",
    "this follows consistently from all approaches ( for the corresponding limiting conditions of the other free parameters )  @xcite .    at low temperatures ,",
    "the landau - zener ( or , equivalently , ground state survival ) probability @xmath6 ( to end up in the ground state when starting in the ground state ) is only influenced little by a diagonally coupled bath .",
    "this was first shown by ao and rammer  @xcite .",
    "kayanuma  @xcite showed before that in the limit of slow fluctuations of the diabatic energies ( as might be caused by a diagonally coupled bath at low temperatures ) , the landau - zener probability is not modified . at zero temperature ,",
    "a diagonally coupled bath has strictly no influence on the landau - zener probability , as has been shown by wubs _",
    "et al . _",
    "this is true not only for bosonic but also for spin environments  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , transversely coupled baths lower the landau - zener probability even at zero temperatures  @xcite and their effects depend on the details of the bath characteristics  @xcite .",
    "the strong damping limit can be reached in two ways . for large coupling between system and bath and finite temperatures , ao and rammer  @xcite",
    "have shown that again a diagonally coupled bath does not influence the landau - zener probability .",
    "conversely , in the high temperature limit under adiabatic conditions ( i.e. , slow sweeps ) , the two states are driven to equal population , @xmath8 .",
    "this has first been shown by kayanuma  @xcite for large and fast fluctuations and later by ao and rammer  @xcite .",
    "pokrovsky and sun  @xcite have extended kayanuma s result to transversely coupled environments .    for the experimentally important parameter range of slow ( adiabatic ) sweeps and intermediate temperatures but only weakly coupled environments , pokrovsky and sun  @xcite , kayanuma and nakayama  @xcite and ao and rammer  @xcite",
    "each give approximate solutions of the influence of the environmental fluctuations on the landau - zener probability .",
    "using the numerically exact quasiadiabatic propagator path - integral ( quapi ) technique , we recently described the landau - zener probability in the full parameter space  @xcite . for small sweep velocities and medium to high temperatures",
    ", we have discovered non - monotonic dependencies on the sweep velocity , temperature , coupling strength and cut - off frequency which were not included in the previous approximate solutions . this behavior can be understood in simple physical terms as a nontrivial competition between relaxation and landau - zener driving .",
    "the direct influence of environmental fluctuations on the dynamics of a driven two - state system is much more pronounced when the system is initially prepared in the excited state since spontaneous emission is even possible at zero temperature .",
    "accordingly , the excitation survival probability @xmath7 ( to end up in the excited state having started in the excited state ) , which is without environment strictly identical to the landau - zener probability , is strongly modified for all temperatures and bath coupling strengths  @xcite . although experimentally highly relevant , the excitation survival probability received much less attention . in the limit of fast ( nonadiabatic ) sweeps ,",
    "no influence of a bath is expected  @xcite . in the high temperature limit under adiabatic conditions ( slow sweeps )",
    ", the two states are again driven to equal population , @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "thus , in both limits the excitation survival probability is identical to the landau - zener probability , @xmath10 .",
    "however , this is quite different at intermediate and low temperatures since spontaneous emission drastically changes the excitation survival probability .",
    "ao and rammer  @xcite were the first to remark that in the limit of weak system - bath coupling , a discontinuity occurs . in the limit of strong coupling and low temperature , kayanuma and nakayama",
    "@xcite find another simple analytical expression , @xmath11 with @xmath4 being the landau - zener probability without environment .",
    "both , kayanuma and nakayama  @xcite and ao and rammer  @xcite give approximate solutions to the experimentally important parameter range of slow ( adiabatic ) sweeps and intermediate temperatures , but only weakly coupled environments . nevertheless , this parameter range is still largely unexplored .    beyond these direct approaches ,",
    "the dissipative landau - zener problem was discussed in many more facets .",
    "not being able to give a full review of all works , we just mention in passing that moyer discussed the landau - zener problem for decaying states involving complex energy _ eigenvalues _",
    "extensions to three - state systems  @xcite or circuit qed problems  @xcite have been made recently .",
    "finally , we also mention that spin environments in context of landau - zener transitions have been discussed by garanin et al .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the dissipative landau - zener problem in the full parameter range of sweep velocities , temperatures , damping strengths and cut - off frequency by means of the quasiadiabatic propagator path - integral ( quapi ) @xcite .",
    "it allows to include nonadiabatic as well as non - markovian effects yielding numerically exact results . in the next section",
    "we introduce the basic model . in the third section",
    "we discuss the time - dependent occupation probability of the two states during a landau - zener transition and in the following section we focus on the asymptotic populations discussing the landau - zener ( ground state survival ) and the excitation survival probabilities in dependence of the sweep velocities , temperatures , damping strengths and cut - off frequency .",
    "we show that interesting features arise due to a competition between time scales associated to the landau - zener sweep and to dissipative transitions .",
    "finally , we conclude with a short summary .",
    "a quantum mechanical two - state system which shows an avoided energy level crossing when driven is described by the landau - zener hamiltonian ( @xmath12 ) h_lz(t ) = _ x + _ z , with the tunneling matrix element @xmath0 and the energy gap between the diabatic states @xmath13 , changing linearly in time with sweep velocity @xmath1 . here , @xmath14 are pauli matrices and the diabatic states are the eigenstates ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) of @xmath17 .",

    "thus , the sweep velocity of the minimum in the landau - zener probability as well as @xmath117 in the excitation survival probability increase for larger coupling strengths @xmath28 ( at fixed temperature ) .",
    "this is confirmed by fig .",

    "the minimum of @xmath6 and @xmath117 for @xmath7 are still observable for @xmath130 for temperatures @xmath131 . at higher temperatures ,",
    "only a shoulder remains for @xmath6 in fig .",
    "[ figh8 ] and @xmath7 in fig .",
    "[ figh9 ] does not exceed @xmath132 anymore .",
    "results for @xmath6 and @xmath7 for even stronger coupling @xmath133 are shown in fig .",
    "[ figh10 ] . for @xmath133 ,",
    "the local extrema in @xmath6 disappear , but a monotonic growth of @xmath6 with decreasing sweep velocity is still in line with our simple picture . for coupling strengths @xmath134",
    "no bath influence is expected anymore  @xcite for the landau - zener probability , consistent with our data .",
    "therefore , we focus on @xmath135 . at the same time",
    "the excitation survival probability is expected to follow @xmath136 at strong coupling and low temperatures  @xcite . as seen in fig .",
    "[ figh10 ] , @xmath7 indeed approaches @xmath137 with decreasing temperature for @xmath133 .",
    "this striking behavior of the excitation survival probability at strong coupling opens a road to determine the coupling strengths in experimental systems . under weak coupling conditions ,",
    "the minimum in the landau - zener probability allows to obtain @xmath28 . for strong coupling ,",
    "the minimum vanishes but the excitation survival probability still shows a clear peak .",
    "especially the temperature dependence of the peak clearly separates strong from weak coupling . for strong coupling ,",
    "the peak height increases with temperature while for weak coupling , the peak height decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "next , we investigate the dependence of @xmath6 and @xmath7 on the system - bath coupling in the regime of weak coupling .",
    "[ figh11 ] shows the landau - zener probability for different @xmath28 at a fixed temperature @xmath80 . for increasing coupling , @xmath73 shifts to larger velocities .",
    "in fact , @xmath73 depends linearly on @xmath28 , see inset of fig .",
    "[ figh11 ] .",
    "the linear dependence is also predicted by our model , i.e. , @xmath138 , in very good agreement with the fit @xmath139 .",
    "the decreasing maximum @xmath140 results from the shifting minimum .",
    "another remarkable fact is that the landau - zener probability @xmath74 at the minimum velocity is independent of @xmath28 , as predicted by our physical picture , see eq .",
    "( [ pvmin ] ) .",
    "we estimate the averaged splitting @xmath141 , in fair agreement with @xmath142 , obtained with @xmath143 $ ] from the data in fig .",
    "[ figh11 ] .",
    "this agreement strongly supports our physical picture that relaxation dominates in the intermediate temperature range for small sweep velocities .",
    "the excitation survival probability @xmath7 is shown in fig .",
    "[ figh12 ] for different @xmath28 at a fixed temperature @xmath80 . for increasing coupling , @xmath117 shifts to larger velocities .",
    "as before @xmath73 for the landau - zener probability , now @xmath117 for the excitation survival probability depends linearly on @xmath28 , see inset of fig .  [ figh12 ]",
    "again , the linear dependence is predicted by our model , i.e. , @xmath144 ( taking the previously determined factor @xmath145 into account ) , in very good agreement with the fit @xmath146 . the decreasing peak height in @xmath7 results from the shifting @xmath117 .",
    "there is an additional time scale provided by the bath dynamics , which determines how fast the bath relaxes to its own thermal equilibrium due to the coupling to the system .",
    "it is given by the reorganization energy @xcite and depends on the cut - off frequency @xmath27 of the bath spectrum . in turn",
    ", the relaxation rate ( [ rate ] ) also depends on @xmath27 and relaxation is strongly suppressed when @xmath147 .",
    "[ figh13 ] shows @xmath6 and fig .",
    "[ figh14 ] shows @xmath7 for different @xmath27 , ranging down to @xmath148 .",
    "such small values of the cut - off frequency describe slow bath fluctuations , a situation , for instance , typical for the biomolecular exciton dynamics in a protein - solvent environment @xcite . with decreasing cut - off frequencies , the minimum in @xmath77 as well as @xmath117 in @xmath7 shift to smaller @xmath1 as qualitatively expected from eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) and ( [ downrate ] ) respectively .",
    "we note that this is rather surprising since a small @xmath27 also induces strong non - markovian effects . at the same time",
    ", the landau - zener probability @xmath74 decreases . with decreasing @xmath27 , the resonance time @xmath86 and the averaged energy splitting @xmath105 also decrease . for cut - off frequencies @xmath149 ,",
    "we expect @xmath150 , in fair agreement with the fit @xmath151 .",
    "this is shown in the upper inset in fig .",
    "[ figh13 ] .",
    "the lower inset shows @xmath152 versus @xmath27 .",
    "the solid lines are predictions from our model and are in fair agreement with data .",
    "a similar analysis for @xmath117 was not possible since for small @xmath27 the excitation survival probability @xmath153 did not sharply fall below @xmath154 and thus @xmath117 could not be determined unambiguously .",
    "we have investigated the dissipative landau - zener problem by means of the numerically exact quasiadiabatic propagator path - integral @xcite approach for an ohmic bath .",
    "thereby we discussed the landau - zener probability ( to end up in the ground state when starting in the ground state ) as well as the excitation survival probability ( to end up in the excited state when starting in the excited state ) . in the limits of large and small sweep velocities and low temperatures ,",
    "our results coincide with analytical predictions @xcite . in the intermediate regime , when the sweep velocities are comparable to the minimal landau - zener gap and intermediate temperatures , we have identified novel non - monotonic dependencies of the landau - zener probabilities on the sweep velocity , temperature , system - bath coupling strength and cut - off frequency .",
    "this parameter range is clearly not accessible by perturbative means .",
    "the observed behavior can be understood in rather simple physical terms as a nontrivial competition between relaxation and landau - zener driving .",
    "the main difference between the landau - zener and the excitation survival probability results from the simple fact that the excited state can always decay via spontaneous emission while the ground state needs a thermally excited phonon in order to become excited .",
    "thus even at vanishing temperature the excitation survival probability decreases strongly for small enough driving speed whereas the landau - zener probability only for high temperatures . as",
    "nowadays advanced experimental set - ups allow for a rather comprehensive control of the parameters , this novel feature should be accessible by available experimental techniques .",
