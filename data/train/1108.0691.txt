    "anderson localization of super - fluid atomic gases in weak disordered potentials with a large exponential tail is currently attracting a lot of interest in both experimental and theoretical studies . in experimental studies , disorder laser speckle @xcite and quasi - periodic optical lattice ( ol ) @xcite have been used to localize bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) .",
    "the original description of anderson localization was based on the localization of non - interacting quantum waves in disorder potentials due to a cancellation of wave fronts coming from different locations of the disorder potential . however , super - fluid atomic gases usually are interacting and the study of anderson localization has also been extended to the case of localization of a single - component @xcite or binary @xcite bec under repulsive effective interactions . both quasi - periodic ol in one @xcite and three dimensions @xcite and random potential @xcite",
    "were used in these studies .",
    "the effect of temperature on anderson localization has also been investigated @xcite .",
    "another topic of current interest is the problem of trapped binary super - fluids , where the two components could be two different hyperfine states of the same atom ( @xmath0rb ) @xcite or two different atoms . in the latter case ,",
    "degenerate bose - fermi @xmath0rb-@xmath1k mixture @xcite , degenerate fermi - fermi mixture of @xmath1k @xcite and of @xmath2li @xcite were considered among others . in particular , the feshbach resonance technique driven by a magnetic @xcite or optical @xcite field allows one to vary the atomic interaction that opens the possibility for the study of localization of binary condensates with controllable interactions .",
    "a bose - fermi mixture can exhibit quite distinct features as the number of atoms and the inter - species and intra - species interactions are varied .",
    "for example , the intra - species repulsive interaction combined with the inter - species attraction may give rise to the symbiotic soliton @xcite .",
    "in reference @xcite , we demonstrated that the inter - species attraction contributes to an attractive point - like effective potential which affects the atom density distribution and the stability properties of the condensate @xcite .",
    "here we investigate the symbiotic localization of a cigar - shaped bose - fermi superfluid mixture without a trap .",
    "the fermi superfluid is taken to be a mixture of equal number of spin up and down components in a paired state .",
    "we also consider anderson localization of the bose component in the bose - fermi mixture in a quasi - periodic bichromatic ol when the bose component is not localized in the absence of the ol . in both cases",
    "the intra - species bose interaction is taken to be repulsive and the fermi component is considered to be at unitarity @xcite .",
    "the unitarity limit is the limit of strong attraction between spin - up and -down fermions with the fermi - fermi scattering length approaching infinity .",
    "consequently , the properties of the fermi superfluid in this limit become _ universal _ and independent of the fermi - fermi scattering length and are solely determined by the fermi energy and fermi momentum .",
    "the unitary limit of fermi superfluid can now be routinely achived and studied in laboratory @xcite . for a theoretical description of the interacting bose - fermi mixture we consider the mean - field gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation of bosons coupled to a mean - field hydrodynamic density - functional equation @xcite for fermions at unitarity .",
    "the present investigation involves numerical simulation as well as analytical study based on a variational approach .",
    "the formation of symbiotic and anderson localizations as a function of bose and fermi number is illustrated in a phase diagram . by numerical simulation of the coupled mean - field model using the split - step",
    "fourier spectral method , we confirm the existence of the symbiotic localized states in the bose - fermi mixture without external trapping potential .",
    "we also identify anderson localization of the bose component with an exponential tail assisted by the fermi component in the presence of a quasi - periodic bichromatic ol .",
    "we find that the anderson localization of the bose component is possible in the mixture for an inter - species attraction which neutralizes mostly the bosonic repulsion .",
    "finally , we establish the stability of both symbiotic and anderson localizations under small perturbations .    in sec .",
    "[ ii ] we present a brief account of the coupled mean - field model and the bichromatic ol potential used in the study .",
    "the analytical expressions for the width of the bose and fermi localized states obtained by the variational analysis of the mean - field model are in reasonable agreement of the numerical solution .",

    "]    next we consider the dynamics of an anderson localized bose state in the bose - fermi mixture on the bichromatic ol ( [ pot ] ) with @xmath113 and @xmath114 corresponding to one of the localized states of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) .",
    "the dynamics is initiated by introducing a phase @xmath107 in the wave function of one of the components to start a translational motion . because of the quasi - periodic ol ( [ pot ] ) , the bound bose - fermi localized state oscillates together periodically about the origin in one site of the ol after introducing an initial momentum into one of the components , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] which shows only the movement of the center of the bose component , e.g. , @xmath115 vs. @xmath101 .",
    "different initial momenta result in oscillation with different amplitudes , see the solid line ( @xmath116 ) , dashed line ( @xmath117 ) and the dotted line ( @xmath118 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . sustained oscillation of the bose ( as well as the bound fermi component not shown here ) component confirms the stability of the coupled bose - fermi state .",
    "here we studied symbiotic localization in a cigar - shaped bose - fermi super - fluid with intra - species repulsion and inter - species attraction .",
    "the fermi component is considered at unitarity . in the presence of a quasi - periodic bichromatic ol ,",
    "the bose component in the bose - fermi mixture could exhibit anderson localization with large exponential tail due to a near cancellation of the intra - species repulsion and inter - species attraction while no localization is possible in the absence of the ol .",
    "no evidence of anderson localization with long exponential tail was found in the fermi component .",
    "the cigar - shaped bose - fermi mixture is described by an effective one - dimensional gp equation for bosons coupled to a mean - field hydrodynamic equation for fermions at unitarity @xcite . in this study",
    ", we use both numerical and variational solution of the mean - field equation for the mixture .",
    "we obtain a phase plot of number of bosonic and fermionic atoms showing the domain of symbiotic localization without external trap and localization in the presence of a quasi - periodic bichromatic ol .",
    "the numerical and variational densities of the localized states are in good agreement with each other . both symbiotic localization and anderson localization are found to be dynamically stable when given a small initial velocity to one of the components .",
    "the bose and fermi components are found to move together under such a perturbation . with present know how , it should be possible to study the anderson localization of the bose component in the bose - fermi mixture on a bichromatic ol experimentally under appropriate condition .",
