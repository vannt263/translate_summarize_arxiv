    "the idea of the static universe once conceived by albert einstein faced a big threat when at the turn of the last century observations of ia supernova confirmed that our universe is suffering from an accelerated expansion ( perlmutter , s. et al .",
    ", 1999 ; spergel , d. n. et al.2003 ) .",
    "now belief and observations are always to be supported by some model . in the quest of finding a suitable model for universe , cosmologists started to investigate the root cause that is triggering this expansion .",
    "fundamentally , we were to modify einstein s equation either by modifying the left hand side , i.e. , modifying the idea of einstein gravity or to modify the right hand side which immediately speculate the nature of the matter inside the universe .",
    "if our universe is filled up by some invisible fluid causing a negative pressure then it violates the strong energy condition i.e. @xmath0 . because of its invisible nature this energy component was aptly termed as dark energy ( de ) ( riess , a. g. et al . , 2004 ) .    with the introduction of de , the search began for different candidates that can effectively play the role of de .",
    "de represented by a scalar field is often called quintessence . not only scalar field but",
    "also there are other dark fluid models like chaplygin gas which plays the role of de very efficiently .",
    "the earliest form of this was known as pure chaplygin gas ( kamenshchik , a. et al.,2001 ; gorini , v. et al . 2004 ) .",
    "extensive research saw pure chaplygin gas first modify into generalized chaplygin gas ( gorini , v. et al . , 2006 ; alam , u. et al .",
    "2003 ; bento , m. c. et al .",
    "2002;carturan , d. and finelli , f. 2003 ; barreiro , t. and sen , a.a . 2004 ) and later into modified chaplygin gas ( mcg ) obeying the equation of state ( benaoum , h. b. , 2002 ; debnath , u. , 2004 )    @xmath1    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are respectively the pressure and energy density and @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are positive constants .",
    "currently , we live in a special epoch where the densities of de and dm are comparable .",
    "although they have evolved independently from different mass scales .",
    "this is known as the famous cosmic coincidence problem . till date",
    "several attempts have been made to find a solution to this problem ( del campo , s. et al 2009 ; leon , g. and saridakis , e.n .",

    "a suitable interaction between de and dm is required if we wish to find an effective solution to this problem .",
    "it is obvious that there has been a transition from a matter dominated universe to dark energy dominated universe , by exchange of energy at an appropriate rate . now",
    "the expansion history of the universe as determined by the supernovae and cmb data ( jamil , m.et al . 2010a ; jamil , m. and saridakis , e. n. 2010b ) bounds us to fix the decay rate such that it is proportional to the present day hubble parameter . keeping the fact in mind cosmologists all over the world",
    "have studied and proposed a variety of interacting de models ( setare , m. r. 2006,2007c ; hu , b. and ling , y. 2006 ; wu , p. and yu , h. 2007 ; jamil , m. 2010e , 2011 ; dalal , n. 2001 ) .    here",
    "we shall use mcg as the de and the equation of state for mcg is given by ( [ 2 ] ) with @xmath7 recent developments regarding mcg can be found in ( lu , j. et al .",

    "al . 2008 ; debnath , u. 2007 ) .",
    "this special form also appears to be consistent with the wmap 5-year data and henceforth support the unified model with de and dm based on generalized cg ( makler , m. et al .",

    "recent supernovae data also favours the two - fluid cosmological model with cg and matter ( panotopoulos , g. 2008 ) .    as we have stated earlier , modifying the right hand side of einstein s equation",
    "was not the only way to explain the increase in the rate of the expansion , rather to modify the gravity part of the left hand side is also to demonstrate the present day universe .",
    "in this branch brane - gravity was introduced and brane cosmology was developed .",
    "a review on brane - gravity and its various applications with special attention to cosmology is available in ( rubakov , v. a. 2001 ; maartens , r. 2004 ; brax .",
    "2004 ; csa ki , c. 2004 ) . in this work",
    "we consider the two most popular brane models , namely dgp and rs ii branes .",
    "our main aim of this work is to examine the nature of the different physical parameters for the universe around the stable critical points in two brane world models in presence of mcg .",
    "impact of any future singularity caused by the de in brane world models will be studied .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 comprises of the dynamical system analysis in dgp brane model .",
    "section 3 deals with the dynamical system analysis in rs ii brane model , followed by a general discussion in section 4 .",
    "a simple and effective model of brane - gravity is the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) braneworld model ( dvali , g. r. et al .",
    "2000 ; deffayet , d. 2001 ; deffayet , d. et al .",
    "2002 ) which models our 4-dimensional world as a frw brane embedded in a 5-dimensional minkowski bulk .",
    "it explains the origin of de as the gravity on the brane leaking to the bulk at large scale . on the 4-dimensional brane",
    "the action of gravity is proportional to @xmath8 whereas in the bulk it is proportional to the corresponding quantity in 5-dimensions .",
    "the model is then characterized by a cross over length scale @xmath9 such that gravity is 4-dimensional theory at scales @xmath10 where matter behaves as pressureless dust , but gravity leaks out into the bulk at scales @xmath11 and matter approaches the behaviour of a cosmological constant .",
    "moreover it has been shown that the standard friedmann cosmology can be firmly embedded in dgp brane .",
    "it may be noted that in literature , standard dgp model has been generalized to ( i ) ldgp model by adding a cosmological constant ( lue , a . and starkman , g .",
    "d. 2004 ) , ( ii ) qdgp model by adding a quintessence perfect fluid ( chimento , l .",
    "2006 ) , ( iii ) cdgp model by chaplygin gas ( bouhmadi - lopez , m. and lazkoz , r. 2007 ) and ( iv ) sdgp by a scalar field ( zhang , h. and zhu , z. h. 2007 ) . in ( wu , x. et al . 2008 )",
    "the dgp model has been analysed by adding holographic de ( hde ) .      while flat , homogeneous and isotropic brane is being considered , the friedmann equation in dgp brane model(dvali , g. r. et al , 2000 ; deffayet , d. , 2001 ; deffayet , d. et al , 2002 ) is modified to the equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the hubble parameter , @xmath3 is the total cosmic fluid energy density and @xmath14 is the cross - over scale which determines the transition from 4d to 5d behaviour and @xmath15 ( choosing @xmath16 ) . for @xmath17 , we have standard dgp@xmath18 model which is self accelerating model without any form of de , and effective @xmath19 is always non - phantom . however for @xmath20 , we have dgp@xmath21 model which does not self accelerate but requires de on the brane",
    ". it experiences 5d gravitational modifications to its dynamics which effectively screen de .",
    "brane world scenario is actually a modified gravity theory .",
    "if we write the einstein equation for brane world in terms of einstein gravity then the extra term can be treated as the effective de but that is not the physical de .",
    "moreover this de is applicable only in einstein gravity .",
    "but here we will consider the physical de in brane world .",
    "so we have introduced the mcg type fluid in brane .",
    "there are few many candidates of de models , such as scalar field ( nojiri , s.and oditsov , s.d .",
    "2004 ) , phantom ( nojiri , s. et al 2005 ) , k - essence ( bamba , k.et al 2011 ) , tachyonic field ( ( nojiri , s.and oditsov , s.d . 2003 ) , etc .",
    "mcg being a modified form of de with a unique equation of state for de and dm .",
    "also mcg is the observational viable model ( thakur , p. et al 2009 , dev , a. et al 2003 ) .",
    "it interpolates between radiation in early stage and @xmath22cdm in late stage .    as in the present problem the interaction between de and pressureless dark matter",
    "has been taken into account for interacting de and dm the energy balance equation will be @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the interaction term , @xmath26 is the coupling parameter ( or transfer strength ) and @xmath27 is the total cosmic energy density which satisfies the energy conservation equation @xmath28 ( guo , z .- k . and",
    "zhang , y .- z . 2005 ; delcampo , s. et .",
    "al . 2008 ) .",
    "as we have lack of information about the fact how do de and dm interact so we are not able to esteemate the interaction term from the first principles .",
    "however , the negativity of @xmath29 immediately implies the possibility of having negative de in the early universe which is overruled by to the necessity of the second law of thermodynamics to be held(alcaniz , j. s. and lima , j. a. s. 2005 )",
    ". hence @xmath29 must be positive and small . from the observational data of 182 gold type ia supernova samples , cmb data from the three year wmap survey and the baryonic acoustic oscillations from the sloan digital sky survey ,",
    "it is estimated that the coupling parameter between dm and de must be a small positive value ( of the order of unity ) , which satisfies the requirement for solving the cosmic coincidence problem and the second law of thermodynamics ( feng , c. et .",
    "al . 2008 ) . due to the underlying interaction , the beginning of the accelerated expansion",
    "is shifted to higher redshifts . consequently using the friedmann equation ( [ 3 ] ) and",
    "the conservation equation , we obtain the modified raychaudhuri equation @xmath30      in this subsection we plan to analyse the dynamical system . for that firstly the conversion of the physical parameters into some dimensionless form , given by @xmath31 where the present value of the scale factor @xmath32 is assumed . inclusion of ( [ 2 ] ) into ( [ 7 ] ) gives us the parameter gradients as @xmath33 and @xmath34 where , @xmath35 is the eos parameter for mcg determined as @xmath36^{(\\alpha+1)}.\\ ] ]      for mathematical simplicity , we consider @xmath37 only .",

    "dynamical system analysis had been carried out , critical points were found and the stability of the system around those critical points was tested for both dgp and rsii brane models . graphical analysis was done to get an explicit picture of the outcome of the work . in order to find a solution for the cosmic coincidence problem ,",
    "a suitable interaction between de and dm was considered .",
    "the dynamical system of equations characterizing the system was formed and a stable scaling solution was obtained .",
    "the numerical values of the density parameters for de and dm almost coincided with each other ( as seen in graphs 8 and 9 ) .",
    "hence this work can be considered to be a significant one as far as solution of cosmic coincidence problem is concerned . from the above analysis",
    "we conclude that the combination of mcg in brane gravity makes a perfect model for the expanding universe undergoing a late acceleration .",
