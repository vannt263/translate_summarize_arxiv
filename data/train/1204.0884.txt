    "supercooled liquids of glass forming systems are typical examples of high - dimensional systems with highly disordered energy landscapes and our main concern behind this work .",
    "simulations have shown that many important characteristics of such a system are better described by a process on the set of so - called _ metabasins _ ( mb ) than by the more common process on the set of visited minima of the energy landscape ( see @xcite ) .",
    "those mb are formed in the following way by aggregation of suitable states of the describing process @xmath0 along a simulated trajectory :    fixing a reasonable observation time @xmath1 , define @xmath2 and then recursively for @xmath3 @xmath4 then the mb up to @xmath5 are chosen as @xmath6    simulation studies have shown that local sampling within a mb does not affect typical parameters of the process like the diffusion coefficient or the time to reach equilibrium .",
    "dynamical aspects are therefore fully characterized by the mb - valued process .",
    "furthermore , this model reduction by aggregation , as proposed in @xcite and @xcite , offers several advantages ( referred to as properties 15 hereafter ) :    1 .   the probability of a transition from one mb to any other one does not depend on the state at which this mb is entered .",
    "2 .   there are basically no reciprocating jumps between two mb .",
    "this is in strong contrast to the unaggregated process where such jumps occur very often : the system falls back to a minimum many times before eventually cresting a high energy barrier and then falling into a new valley , where it will again take many unsuccessful trials to escape .",
    "these reciprocating jumps are not only irrelevant for the actual motion on the state space but also complicating the estimation of parameters like the diffusion coefficient or the relaxation time . 3 .",
    "the expected time spent in a mb is proportional to its depth .",
    "thus there is a strong and explicit relation between dynamics and thermodynamics , not in terms of the absolute but the relative energy .",
    "the energy barriers between any two mb are approximately of the same height , that is , there is an energy threshold @xmath7 such that , for a small @xmath8 , it requires a crossing of at least @xmath9 and at most @xmath10 to make a transition from one mb to another . such systems with @xmath11 are called trap models ( see @xcite ) .",
    "5 .   the sojourn times and the jump distances between successively visited mb ( measured in euclidean distance ) form sequences of weakly or even uncorrelated random variables , and are also mutually independent , at least approximately . therefore",
    ", the aggregated process can be well approximated by a continuous time random walk , which in turn simplifies its analysis and thus the analysis of the whole process .    despite these advantages ,",
    "the suggested definition of mb has the obvious blemish that it depends on the realization of the considered process and may thus vary from simulation to simulation . to provide a mathematically stringent definition of a _ path - independent aggregation _ of the state space , which maintains the above properties and",
    "is based on the well - established notion of metastable states , is therefore our principal concern here with the main results being theorem [ thm : mb ] and theorem [ thm : pd versus pid mb ] . in this endeavor",
    ", we will draw on some of the ideas developed by bovier in @xcite and by scoppola in @xcite , most notably her definition of metastable states .",
    "metastability , a phenomenon of ongoing interest for complex physical systems described by finite markov processes on very large state spaces , can be defined and dealt with in several ways .",
    "it has been derived from a renormalization procedure in @xcite , by a pathwise approach in @xcite , and via energy landscapes in @xcite , the latter being also our approach hereafter . to characterize a supercooled liquid , i.e.  a glass forming system at low temperature , via its energy landscape",
    "was first done by goldstein in 1969 @xcite and has by now become a common method .",
    "the general task when studying metastability , as well originally raised in physics ( @xcite , @xcite or @xcite ) , is to provide mathematical tools for an analysis of the property of thermodynamical systems to evolve in state space along a trajectory of unstable or metastable states with very long sojourn times .",
    "inspired by simulations of glass forming systems at very low temperatures with the metropolis algorithm , we will study ( as in @xcite ) finite markov chains with exponentially small transition probabilities which are determined by an energy function and a parameter @xmath12 .",
    "this parameter can be understood as the inverse temperature and we are thus interested in the behavior of the process as @xmath13 .",
    "we envisage an energy function of highly complex order and without the hierarchical ordering that is typical in spin glass models .",
    "a good picture is provided by randomly chosen energies with correlations between neighbors or by an energy landscape that looks like a real mountain landscape .",
    "we will show that , towards an aggregation outlined above , the metastable states as defined in @xcite are quite appropriate because they have an ordering from a kind of `` weak '' to a kind of `` strong '' metastability . around those states",
    "we will define and then study connected valleys [ definition [ def : tal ] ] characterized by minimal energy barriers . in the limit of low temperatures , any such barrier will determine the speed , respectively probability of a transition between the two valleys it separates .",
    "more precisely , in the limit @xmath14 , the process , when starting in a state @xmath15 , will almost surely reach a state with lower barrier earlier than a state with higher barrier [ theorem [ thm : driftzumminimum ] ] . in the limit of low temperatures , the bottom ( minimum ) of an entered valley",
    "will therefore almost surely be reached before that valley is left again [ proposition [ prop : bergnge ] ] . as a consequence ,",
    "the probability for a transition from one valley to another is asymptotically independent of the state where the valley is entered .",
    "this is property 1 above .",
    "furthermore , since valleys as well as metastable states have a hierarchical ordering , we can build valleys of higher order by a successive merger of valleys of lower order [ proposition [ prop : taelerrekursion ] ] .",
    "given an appropriate energy landscape , this procedure can annihilate ( on the macroscopic scale ) the accumulation of reciprocating jumps by merging valleys exhibiting such jumps into a single valley [ subsection [ subsec : wkeiten ] ] .",
    "hence , valleys of sufficiently high order will have property 2 .    beside the macroscopic process [ section [ sec : makroskopischerprozess ] ] , which describes the transitions between valleys",
    ", one can also analyze the microscopic process [ section [ sec : mikroskopischerprozess ] ] , that is , the system behavior when moving within a fixed valley . here",
    "we will give a formula for the exit time and connect it with its parameters [ theorem [ thm : verlassenszeit ] ] .",
    "this will confirm property 3 .",
    "having thus established properties 14 [ theorem [ thm : mb ] ] , we will finally proceed to a comparison of our path - independent definition of mb with the path - dependent one given above .",
    "it will be shown [ theorem [ thm : pd versus pid mb ] ] that both coincide with high probability under some reasonable conditions on the connectivity of valleys which , in essence , ensure the existence of reasonable path - dependent mb .",
    "we will also briefly touch on the phenomenon of quasi - stationarity [ proposition [ prop : eigenwerte ] ] which is a large area @xcite but to our best knowledge less studied in connection with the aggregation of states of large physical systems driven by energy landscapes .",
    "let us mention two further publications which , despite having a different thrust , provide definitions of valleys , called basins of attraction or metastates there , to deal with related questions .",
    "olivieri & scoppola @xcite fully describe the tube of exit from a domain in terms of which basins of attraction of increasing order are visited during a stay in that domain and for how long these basins are visited . in a very recent publication , beltrn & landim @xcite , by working with transition rates instead of energies , aim at finding a universal depth ( and time scale ) for all metastates .",
    "however , we rather aim at the _ finest aggregation such that transitions back to an already visited metastate are very unlikely within a time frame used in simulations_. this finest aggregation will lead to valleys of very variable depth just as simulations do not exhibit a universal depth or timescale .",
    "let @xmath16 be a markov chain on a finite set @xmath17 with transition matrix @xmath18 and stationary distribution @xmath19 , and let @xmath20 be an energy function such that the following conditions hold :    irreducibility : : :    @xmath21 is irreducible with @xmath22    and @xmath23 iff @xmath24 for all    @xmath25 .",

    "we are thus dealing with a reversible markov chain with exponentially small transition probabilities driven by an energy landscape .",
