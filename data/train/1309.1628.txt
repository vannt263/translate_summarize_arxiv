    "thinning ( or skeletonization ) is the process of reducing an object to its skeleton . the topology preserving skeleton may be informally defined as a thinned subset of the object that retains the same topology of the original object and often many of its significant morphological properties .",
    "thinning is a very active research area thanks to its ability of reducing the amount of information to be processed for example in medical image analysis and visualization as well as simplifying the development of pattern recognition or computer - aided diagnosis algorithms .",
    "hence , it is not surprising that thinning gained a pivotal role in a wide range of applications .",
    "an exhaustive review of the literature is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "two dimensional skeletons have been used for digital image analysis and processing , optical character and fingerprint recognition , pattern recognition and matching , and binary image compression since a long time ago , see for example the survey paper  @xcite .",
    "more recently , three dimensional skeletons have been widely used in computer vision and shape analysis  @xcite , in computer graphics for mesh animation  @xcite and in computer aided design ( cad ) for model analysis and simplification  @xcite ,  @xcite and for topology repair  @xcite .",
    "there is also a vast literature of applications of skeletons in medical imaging .",
    "they have been used for route planning in virtual endoscopic navigation  @xcite , for example in virtual colonoscopy  @xcite-@xcite or bronchoscopy  @xcite .",
    "skeletons have also been an important part of clinical image analysis by providing centerlines of tubular structures . in particular",
    ", there is a large body of literature showing applications of skeletons to blood veins centerline extraction from angiographic images  @xcite ,  @xcite-@xcite , and intrathoracic airway trees classification for the evaluation of the bronchial tree structure  @xcite .",
    "also protein backbone models can be produced with techniques based on skeletons  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , many computer - aided diagnostic tools rely on skeletons .",
    "for example , skeletons have been used to identify blood vessels stenoses  @xcite-@xcite , tracheal stenoses  @xcite , polyps and cancer in colon  @xcite and left atrium fibrosis  @xcite .",
    "there are medical applications of skeletons where topology preservation is essential .",
    "non invasively determine the three - dimensional topological network of the trabecular bone  @xcite is a good example .",
    "indeed , many studies demonstrate that the elastic modulus and strength of the bones is determined by the topological interconnections of the bone structure rather than the bone volume fraction  @xcite ,  @xcite",
    ". therefore , topological analysis plays a fundamental role in computer - aided diagnostic tools for osteoporosis  @xcite .",
    "topology preserving thinning is non trivial and a vast literature , briefly surveyed in sec .",
    "[ prior ] , has been dedicated to this topic . in particular , thinning by iteratively removing _ simple points _",
    "@xcite is a widely used and effective technique .",
    "it works locally and for this reason is efficient and easy to implement .",
    "while reading the literature one may notice that thinning algorithms are claimed to be `` topology preserving , '' even though in most cases a precise statement of what that means is left unaddressed .",
    "this paper uses _ homology theory _",
    "@xcite to rigorously define what the virtue of being topology preserving actually consists of .",
    "this theory is less intuitive than the concepts used so far , including simple homotopy type @xcite , but exhibits some important theoretical and practical advantages that will be highlighted later in the paper .",
    "we remark that a homological definition of simple points has already been used in the context of skeletonization in  @xcite ,  @xcite , but only in the case of cubical complexes .",
    "this paper generalizes this idea to cell complexes that are more general than cubical complexes .",
    "there are many applications that would benefit from an algorithm that deals with general unstructured simplicial complexes  [ p. 35]@xcite",
    "in fact , the geometry of three - dimensional objects is frequently specified by a triangulated surface , obtained for example by using an isosurface algorithm as _ marching cubes _  [ p. 539]@xcite",
    ", @xcite applied on voxel data from computed tomography , magnetic resonance imaging or any other three - dimensional imaging technique .",
    "another possibility is to obtain the triangulations from the convex hull of point clouds provided for example by 3d laser scanners .",
    "triangulated surfaces offer two potential advantages over voxel representation .",
    "they allow to adaptively simplify the surface triangulation , see for example fig . 16.20 in",
    "[ p. 549]@xcite .",
    "they also allow to visualize and edit the object efficiently with off - the - shelf software ( for example the many visualization and editing tools for stereo lithography ) and without the starcase artifacts typical of voxel representation of objects with curved boundary .",
    "one may even easily print the object with additive manufacturing technology ( i.e. 3d printers ) .",
    "another issue that arises reading the literature is that many different definitions of topology preserving skeleton exist . in some papers ,",
    "the skeleton is obtained by removing simple pairs in the spirit of simple homotopy theory by what is well known as _",
    "collapsing _ in algebraic topology @xcite . the resulting skeleton ,",
    "if no other constraints are used , has a lower dimension with respect to the input complex . on the contrary , this paper assumes that the skeleton is always a solid object of the same dimension as the initial complex .",
    "the difference is highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig : def ] .     representing an annulus .",
    "on the left , the thick cycle represents a 1-dimensional skeleton of @xmath0 obtained by means of standard _ collapsing _ of @xmath0 @xcite . on the right ,",
    "the gray triangles represent a 2-dimensional skeleton of @xmath0 according to the definition used in this paper .",
    "this kind of skeleton is obtained after removing a sequence of top dimensional cells . ]    in this paper the skeleton of a given complex @xmath0 is defined as a subset @xmath1 that is obtained from @xmath0 after removing a sequence of top dimensional cells .",
    "we require that the _ homology _  @xcite of the initial complex @xmath0 is preserved during this process . in particular , a top dimensional cell can be safely removed if this does not change the homology of the _ complement _ of @xmath2 .",
    "[ fig:2intersection ] provides an intuitive explanation why the last requirement is desirable .",
    "this additional requirement , to the best of our knowledge , is not documented in other papers .",
    "we call this cell a _ simple cell _ , which is a generalization of the idea of _ simple points",
    "_  @xcite in digital topology .",
    "is used to skeletonize a 2-dimensional simplicial complex @xmath0 representing an annulus .",
    "let the dark gray triangles belong to the skeleton . on the left , the result obtained by checking whether the removal of a cell changes the topology of @xmath0 complement . on the right",
    ", the result obtained by checking whether the removal of a cell changes the topology of @xmath0 . the numbers inside triangles indicate the iteration number of the while loop in the thinning algorithm when they were removed .",
    "both skeletons preserve topology .",
    "however , in most applications , the skeleton on the left is preferred . ]    clearly , in nontrivial cases , the skeleton @xmath2 is not unique .",
    "resorting to explicit homology computations to detect simple points as in  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite is quite computationally intensive , as the worst - case complexity of homology computations is cubical , see also the discussion in  @xcite . in this paper , we introduce a much more efficient solution by exploiting the idea of tabulated configurations , i.e. _ acyclicity tables _ , that are described in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : tables ] .    usually , a skeleton also requires to preserve the shape of the object . in this paper",
    "we show some very simple proof of concept idea how to preserve both homology and shape .",
    "of course , this is just an example to illustrate how the idea of acyclicity tables can be used together with some additional techniques that guarantee shape preservation .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ prior ] the prior work on thinning algorithms is surveyed .",
    "section  [ contrib ] analyzes the original contributions of the present paper . in section  [ sec : intrototopology ] the property of being a homology preserving thinning is rigorously stated . in section  [ sec : tables ] the concept of acyclicity tables is introduced , whereas , in section  [ sec : topologypreservingalgorithm ] , the topology preserving thinning algorithm is presented .",
    "section  [ sec : benchmarks ] discusses the results of the thinning algorithm on a number of benchmarks and , finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] the conclusions are drawn .",
    "there are hundreds of papers about thinning .",
    "most of them fall into two categories . on one hand , there are papers using morphological operations like erosion and dilatations to obtains skeletons , see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "they do not guarantee topology preservation in general .",
    "the others use the idea of removing the so called simple points from the given cell complex , see  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite . without pretending to be exhaustive , in the following",
    "we resume previous results .      most of the work on thinning regard finding skeletons of 2-dimensional images . a very comprehensive survey on this topic",
    "may be found in  @xcite .",
    "this case is well covered in literature and general solution exists , see for example @xcite-@xcite .      in case one",
    "wants to skeletonize three ( or higher ) dimensional images , there are much less papers available in literature .",
    "most of them rely on case study , see  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the problem is that it is hard to prove that a rule - based algorithm is general , i.e. it removes a cell if and only if its removal does not change topology . in 3d",
    "there are more than 134 millions possible configurations for a cube neighborhood and only treating correctly _ all _ of them gives a correct thinning algorithm .",
    "references  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite use explicit homology computations to detect simple points .",
    "there are a number of papers presenting thinning algorithms for 3-dimensional images in which euler characteristic is used to guarantee topology preservation , see for example  @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "the problem is that euler characteristic is a rather raw measure of topology and it is not sufficient to preserve topology in general for 3-dimensional cubical complexes . for three dimensional images one needs to use both euler characteristic and connectivity information to preserve topology , but this is not sufficient for four dimensional images .",
    "all the strategies presented so far are applicable only to cubical grids ( pixels , voxels , ... ) . to our best knowledge , there are just a few papers dealing with 2d grids that are not cubical , and they are restricted to 2d binary images modeled by a quadratic , triangular , or hexagonal cell complex , see  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the main reason for the lack of results on general 2d simplicial complexes may be the absence of regularity in unstructured simplicial grids that makes case - study algorithms very hard to devise and to implement .",
    "this gap in the literature is covered by the present paper .      to the best of our knowledge , we are not aware of algorithms that deal with unstructured 3d simplicial complexes or more general cell complexes",
    ". there are only some papers that find the 1-dimensional skeleton by using the well known collapsing in algebraic topology  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "again , this gap in the literature is covered by the present paper .      in this section",
    "the main novelties presented in this paper are summarized :    1 .",
    "the claim `` topology preserving thinning '' is rigorously defined , for any cell complex , by means of homology theory .",
    "a novel topology preserving thinning algorithm that removes simple cells is introduced .",
    "conceptually this algorithm falls into the category of thinning algorithms based on simple points and generalizes all previous papers .",
    "in fact , the acyclicity tables introduced in this paper give a classification of all possible simple points that can occur in a given cell complex .",
    "therefore , no rules are needed since all of them are encoded into the acyclicity tables .",
    "the most important advantage of the novel approach is that acyclicity tables are _ automatically _ filled in advance , for any cellular decomposition , with homology computations performed by a computer .",
    "therefore , once the tables are available , the implementation of a thinning algorithm is straightforward since identifying simple cells requires just queering the acyclicity table . no other topological processing is needed .",
    "the fact that acyclicity tables are filled _ automatically _ and _ correctly _",
    ", for _ all _ possible configurations , provides a rigorous computer - assisted mathematical proof that the homology - based thinning algorithm preserves topology .",
    "it is also verified , simply by checking all acyclic configurations , that using euler characteristic is not enough to ensure preservation of topology in 3-dimensional or higher dimensional cubical and simplicial complexes .",
    "however , when one checks both euler characteristic and that the number of connected component before and after cell removal remains one , then topology is preserved . checking euler characteristic together with connectivity does not suffice to preserve topology in 4d .",
    "the acyclicity tables for simplicial complexes of dimension 2 , 3 and 4 and for cubical complexes of dimension 2 and 3 , that can be freely used in any implementation of the proposed algorithm , are provided as supplemental material at  @xcite .",
    "this way , we dispense readers to implement homology computations to produce the acyclicity tables .",
    "the thinning algorithm , unlike the standard collapsing of algebraic topology  @xcite , does not require the whole cell complex data structure but it uses only the top dimensional elements of the complex , with obvious memory saving .",
    "7 .   as a proof of concept , an open source c++ implementation that works for 3-dimensional simplicial complexes",
    "is provided to the reader as supplemental material at  @xcite .",
    "we remark that the code is optimized for readability and memory usage and not for speed .",
    "when one claims that an algorithm  preserves topology ,  in order to give a precise meaning to this statement , one needs to specify which topological invariant is preserved . in the literature , the invariant is assumed to be , in most cases implicitly , the so called homotopy type  @xcite .",
    "the problem of this choice is that this strong topological invariant in general is not computable according to markov  @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why in this paper we propose to use homology theory which is computable in place of homotopy theory , even if it is weaker than the former .",
    "indeed , homology seems to be the strongest topological invariant that can be rigorously and efficiently computed .",
    "therefore , every time we claim that topology is not changed , implicitly we mean that the homology is not changed .",
    "homology groups may be used to measure and locate holes in a given space .",
    "zero dimensional holes are the connected components . one dimensional holes are handles of a given space , whereas two dimensional holes are voids totally surrounded by the considered space ( i.e. cavities ) .",
    "one can look at a @xmath3-dimensional hole as something bounded by a deformed @xmath3-sphere .",
    "a space is homologically trivial ( or _ acyclic _ ) if it has one connected component and no holes of higher dimensions . a rigorous definition of homology groups is not presented in this paper due to the availability of rigorous mathematical introductions in any textbook of algebraic topology as  @xcite and the lack of space . for a more intuitive presentation for non mathematicians one",
    "one may consult  @xcite ,  @xcite .    in this paper , we consider in particular two standard ways of representing spaces , namely the _ simplicial _ and _ cubical _ complexes .",
    "n - simplex _ is the convex hull of @xmath4 points in general position ( point , edge , triangle , tetrahedron , 4-dimensional tetrahedron ) .",
    "a simplex spanned with vertices @xmath5 is denoted by @xmath6 $ ] . by a _",
    "face _ of a @xmath3-simplex @xmath7 we mean the simplices spanned by a proper subset of vertices spanning @xmath7 .",
    "a _ simplicial complex _",
    "@xmath8 is a set of simplices such that for every simplex @xmath9 and every face @xmath10 of simplex @xmath7 , @xmath11 .",
    "pixels ( 2-cubes ) and voxels ( 3-cubes ) are widely used in image analysis .",
    "they form a cartesian grid , that is a special case of grid where cells are unit squares or unit cubes and the vertices have integer coordinates . even though we assume to deal with a cartesian grid , the results presented in this paper hold also for more general grids such as a rectilinear grid , that is a tessellation of the space by rectangles or parallelepipeds that are not , in general , all congruent to each other",
    "therefore , we define a cubical complex @xmath0 as a set of cubes such that for every cube @xmath12 and for every @xmath10 being face of we have @xmath7 , @xmath13 .",
    "we want to stress here that we assume every cell to be closed , i.e. if a cell is present in a complex , so do are its faces .    in the iterative thinning algorithm presented in this paper , the top dimensional cells ( simplices , voxels )",
    "are iteratively removed from the object .",
    "homology theory is used to ensure that removing of a given cell ( simplex / cube ) does not change the topology of the object .",
    "if removal of a cell does not change the topology , the cell is said to be _",
    "simple_. due to efficiency reasons , the homology can not be recomputed after removing every single element .",
    "in fact , one may compute the homology of a cell complex for instance with  @xcite software , but the worst case computational complexity is cubical .",
    "therefore , the main idea is to rely on the so called mayer  vietoris sequence  @xcite .",
    "let us express the considered space @xmath14 as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a single top dimensional simplex or voxel .",
    "the sequence states that once the intersection @xmath17 is homologically trivial , then the homology of @xmath18 is the same as the homology of @xmath14 .",
    "this important result is the key of the method presented in this paper .",
    "in fact , it implies that , in order to preserve the homology of @xmath14 with respect to @xmath18 , one should check the homology of the intersection @xmath17 . in practice , this may be easily performed with the  @xcite software .",
    "the main novelty of this paper is to present a different idea to speed up the computations .",
    "let @xmath16 be a simplex or voxel .",
    "by @xmath19 we denote the boundary of @xmath16 , i.e. _ all _ lower dimensional cells which are entirely contained in the closure of @xmath16 .",
    "the idea is based on the observation that in @xmath19 there are not too many elements , namely    1 .",
    "@xmath20 in case of triangle ( @xmath21-dimensional simplex ) ; 2 .",
    "@xmath22 in case of tetrahedron ( @xmath23-dimensional simplex ) ; 3 .",
    "@xmath24 in case of 4-dimensional simplex ( i.e. the convex hull of @xmath25 points in @xmath26 in general position ) ; 4 .",
    "@xmath27 in case of pixel ( 2-dimensional cube ) ; 5 .",
    "@xmath28 in case of voxel ( 3-dimensional cube ) .    by _ configuration",
    "_ we mean any subset of @xmath19 .",
    "when looking for simple cells , the configuration characterizes the way @xmath16 intersects the complement of the set that we aim to thin .",
    "a configuration is _ acyclic _ if its homology  computed as the homology of the corresponding chain complex  is trivial .",
    "since the number of all possible configurations in @xmath19 is @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the number of boundary elements of @xmath16 , one may pre - compute the homology of all the configurations and store them in a lookup table . in this case ,",
    "homology computations are done only in a pre - processing stage and once and for all .",
    "after creating such an acyclicity table , one may instantly ( i.e. in @xmath31 time ) get the answer whether the intersection @xmath17 is homologically trivial or not .",
    "this is the strategy that we aim to use in the thinning algorithm .",
    "next section shows how to use the acyclicity tables and how to obtain them automatically .",
    "let us consider a generic cell @xmath16 of a cell complex .",
    "let us fix an order of all boundary elements @xmath32 of @xmath16 .",
    "we consider all subsets of the set @xmath32 and enumerate them in the following way . for @xmath33",
    "the number of a subset @xmath34 is @xmath35 .",
    "the _ acyclicity table _ of @xmath16 is an array of size @xmath36 having , at position @xmath37 , the value _ true _ if the configuration @xmath34 is acyclic and _ false _ otherwise .",
    "let us describe how the acyclicity table is constructed and used starting by considering a tetrahedron ( 3-dimensional simplex ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : templates]a .",
    "let us enumerate vertices , edges and faces of tetrahedron as in fig .",
    "[ fig : templates]a .    -dimensional simplex ( tetrahedron of edges ` 01,02,03,12,13,23 ` and faces ` 012,013,023,123 ` ) , the ( b ) @xmath21-dimensional cube ( pixel of edges ` 01,02,13,23 ` ) the ( c ) @xmath23-dimensional cube ( voxel of edges ` 01,03,04,12,15,23,26,37,45,47,56,67 ` and faces ` 0123,0145,0347,1256,2367,4567 ` ) . ]",
    "we now introduce an ordering on boundary elements of the 3-dimensional simplex ( bold numbers are the indexes of elements in the given order ) : @xmath38 let @xmath39 be the indexes of elements in the considered configuration ( i.e. bold numbers corresponding to elements that are present in the configuration ) .",
    "the index of the configuration in the acyclicity table is computed with@xmath40    the acyclicity table is automatically generated in advance as follows .",
    "all possible configurations of the elements are automatically generated and the homology group of each of these configurations is computed with the  @xcite software . if a configuration turns out to be acyclic , then a _ true _ is set to the place in the array corresponding to the examined configuration , _ false _ otherwise .",
    "suppose the 3-dimensional simplex @xmath41 $ ] is given as input .",
    "let @xmath42 $ ] and @xmath43 $ ] be the maximal elements in the configuration ( i.e. the configuration consists of those elements and the vertices @xmath44,[5],[19]$ ] , edges @xmath45 $ ] , @xmath46 $ ] , @xmath47 $ ] that are the faces of @xmath42 $ ] ) .",
    "this configuration needs to be mapped into the 3-dimensional simplex model presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : templates]a . hence , we have the following mapping between vertices : @xmath48 ` 0 ` , @xmath49 ` 1 ` , @xmath50 ` 2 ` , @xmath51 ` 3 ` .",
    "it is naturally extended to the mapping on simplices .",
    "namely , the triangle @xmath42 $ ] is mapped to @xmath52`0`,`1`,`2`@xmath53 $ ] in the 3-dimensional simplex model , whereas vertex @xmath43 $ ] is mapped to vertex @xmath52`3`@xmath53 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the elements in this configuration are :    1 .",

    "face : @xmath52`0`,`1`,`2`@xmath53 $ ] ( index 11 ) .",
    "consequently , the index of this configuration is @xmath54 one may check , at this position of the provided acyclicity table for 3-dimensional simplices , that this configuration is not acyclic .    in the same spirit",
    ", we introduce an ordering for the 2-dimensional simplex @xmath55 and for the 4-dimensional simplex @xmath56    in the case of cubes , unlike the case of simplices , the model cube is expressly needed to specify the location of vertices in the cube . the model for @xmath21- and @xmath23-dimensional cubes",
    "is represented in fig.s [ fig : templates]b and [ fig : templates]c .",
    "the ordering for the 2-dimensional cube is @xmath57 whereas , for the 3-dimensional cube ( voxel ) is @xmath58 of course , in order to compute the index in the acyclicity table , exactly the same procedure as the one described for the 3-dimensional simplex is used .    historically , the acyclicitiy tables for cubes  @xcite and simplices  @xcite were introduced in order to speed up homology computations . in this paper",
    "we provide an even stronger result .",
    "not only the homology of the initial set and its skeleton is the same , but one can construct a retraction from the initial set to its skeleton . the existence of retraction implies the isomorphism in homology , but the existence of retraction is a stronger property than homology preservation .",
    "we demonstrated the existence of a retraction by a brute - force computer assisted proof , i.e. checking all acyclic configurations .",
    "thus , the following lemma holds .    for every acyclic configuration @xmath59 in the boundary of 2- , 3- or 4-dimensional",
    "simplices and 2- or 3-dimensional cubes ( denoted as @xmath60 ) there exist a simple homotopy retraction from @xmath61 to @xmath59 .    at the end of this section ,",

    "in this section we propose a simple thinning technique that iteratively removes simple cells .",
    "the algorithm is valid both for cubes and simplices provided that the corresponding acyclicity table is used .",
    "we want to point out that the algorithm works on top dimensional cells ( cubes , simplices ) . therefore  unlike the case of homological algorithms or collapsing  there is no need to generate the whole lower dimensional cell complex data structure when checking if @xmath62 is simple . ] .",
    "the input of the algorithm consists of a list @xmath0 of top dimensional cells in the considered set .",
    "the output is a subset of @xmath0 being its skeleton .    at the beginning , we present a first version of the algorithm that preserves only the topology of @xmath0 . at the beginning ,",
    "one searches the list @xmath0 to find all the cells @xmath69 that are simple and store them into a queue @xmath70 .",
    "then , the queue @xmath70 is processed as long as it is not void . in each iteration , an element @xmath71 is removed from the queue @xmath70 . then , with the acyclicity table , one has to check if @xmath71 is simple in the set @xmath72 .",
    "we want to point out that elements already removed form the considered set @xmath72 in previous iterations are treated as the exterior of @xmath72 at a given iteration .",

    "the time complexity of every iteration is @xmath83 , which means that the overall complexity of the procedure is @xmath84 .",

    "we now present in alg .",

    "[ alg : matredshapepreserving ] there is one basic difference with respect to alg .  [ alg : matred ] . in alg .",
    "[ alg : matredshapepreserving ] , after removing a single external layer of cells , a check is made at line  [ shapepreservingcodition ] to determine whether all cells that remain in @xmath72 are already in the boundary of @xmath72 .",
    "once they are , the thinning process terminates .",
    "the topology is still preserved due to line  [ acyclicity ] . the additional constraint used at line  [ shapepreservingcodition ] of alg .",
    "[ alg : matredshapepreserving ] is very simple and it gives acceptable results in practice .",
    "it may be easily coupled with other techniques to preserve shape already described in literature .",
    "finally , we discuss the situation when one wants to keep the skeleton attached to some pieces of the external boundary @xmath10 of the mesh . in this case , when testing whether a top dimensional cell @xmath62 is simple , one should consider @xmath87 as elements in @xmath88 .",
    "in other words , elements from @xmath10 are not considered as an interface between the object to skeletonize and its exterior .",
    "now we are ready to give a formal definition of skeleton .",
    "let us have a simplicial or cubical complex @xmath0 .",
    "a _ skeleton _ of @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath72 , is a set of top dimensional simplices or cubes such that :    1 .",
    "@xmath72 is obtained from @xmath0 by iteratively removing top dimensional elements @xmath89 , provided that the intersection of @xmath90 with @xmath91 complement is acyclic . consequently , homology groups of @xmath72 and @xmath0 are isomorphic ; 2 .",
    "there is no top dimensional element @xmath92 that has an acyclic intersection with @xmath72 complement ( i.e. the process of removing such elements has been run as long as possible . )",

    "it is impossible to avoid this issue due to some intractable problems in topology .    in the follwing",
    ", we formally show that the skeleton obtained from alg .",
    "[ alg : thinning ] satisfies def .",
    "[ def : skeleton ] .",
    "this fact is shown with a sequence of two simple lemmas .",

    "let us show that , for every @xmath93 , homology of @xmath91 and homology of @xmath94 are isomorphic .",
    "let us write the mayer ",
    "vietoris sequence in reduced homology for @xmath95 : @xmath96 @xmath97 _ n ( _ j=1^i-1 t_j )  .",
    "the intersection @xmath98 is acyclic .",
    "this is because the intersection of @xmath90 with the set complement is checked in the acyclicity tables to be acyclic .",
    "once it is , also @xmath98 is acyclic . therefore , @xmath99 is trivial",
    ". also , since @xmath90 is a simplex or cube , it is acyclic .",
    "this provides @xmath100 being trivial ( we are considering reduced homology . ) consequently from the exactness of the presented sequence we have the desired isomorphism between @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the conclusion follows from a simple induction .",
    "[ lem : acintersection ] after termination of the algorithm there is no element @xmath92 that has an acyclic intersection with the @xmath72 complement .",
    "let @xmath89 be the elements removed during the course of the algorithm ( enumeration is given by the order they were removed by the algorithm . )",
    "suppose , by contrary , that a @xmath92 exists such that it has an acyclic intersection with the @xmath72 complement .",
    "let @xmath93 denotes the index of last element among @xmath89 that has nonempty intersection with @xmath62 .",
    "if @xmath103 , then @xmath62 would be put to the queue @xmath70 in the line  [ alg : first ] of alg .",
    "[ alg : thinning ] and removed from @xmath72 in the line  [ alg : remove ] of the algorithm , since no change to its intersection with @xmath72 complements is made by removing @xmath89 .",
    "if @xmath104 , then after removing @xmath90 the intersection of @xmath62 with @xmath72 complement does not change .",
    "therefore , it is acyclic after removing @xmath105 for @xmath106 . when alg .",
    "[ alg : thinning ] removes @xmath90 in the line  [ alg : second ] , @xmath62 is added to the list @xmath70 and it is going to be removed in the line  [ alg : remove ] , since removing @xmath105 for @xmath107 does not affect the acyclicity of the intersection of @xmath62 with the @xmath72 complement . in both cases we showed that @xmath62 is removed from @xmath72 by alg .",
