    "at the heart of the growing field of phononics lies the active use of lattice vibrations in micro- or nanoscale solid state materials .",
    "many applications , ranging from the excitation of confined phonon modes in optomechanical systems  @xcite to the control of confined few - level systems by traveling surface acoustic waves  @xcite , prove that phonons have a great potential to drive and control various solid state systems .",
    "a key optical application of solid state structures is the semiconductor laser . here",
    "semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) play an increasing role as active laser medium and , in the extreme limit , even a single qd has been shown to give rise to lasing @xcite . while carrier - phonon interaction is an important ingredient for energy relaxation , e.g. , when bringing carriers from the wetting layer into the laser - active qds , for the laser process itself the coupling to phonons often does not play a crucial role .",
    "only recently , the two fields  phononics and semiconductor laser physics  have been combined by using traveling coherent phonon wave packets to control the laser output  @xcite .    in such an experiment , which is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : motiv](a ) , a layer of qds , surrounded by two distributed bragg reflectors ( dbrs ) , is used as the active laser medium , which can be pumped optically  @xcite or electrically  @xcite . by rapidly heating an aluminum film a coherent phonon wave packet",
    "is created , which travels through the structure . due to nonlinear propagation in the material and the transit through the bragg mirror the strain profile arriving at the qd layer , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : motiv](b ) , is rather complex .",
    "when the phonons impinge on the qds , the laser output can be greatly enhanced , but also quenching can be induced .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : motiv](c ) , where an example of the measured laser intensity @xmath0 normalized to the stationary state intensity @xmath1 is shown .",
    "the interpretation of the coupled phonon - exciton - photon system is rather sophisticated .",
    "we have recently developed a semiclassical laser model , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : motiv](d ) , which has been shown to well reproduce the experimentally observed laser outputs  @xcite . however , due to the complex strain pulses present in the experiment , a clear interpretation and in particular a separation between different phenomena is still challenging .",
    "two effects turned out to be important , when controlling the laser output : on the one hand the _ adiabatic shift _ of the ensemble , which dynamically changes the number of qds in resonance with the laser cavity . on the other hand the _ shaking effect _ of the ensemble , which rapidly brings initially detuned and therefore highly occupied qd excitons into resonance with the cavity . in this paper",
    ", we are going to use this recently developed model to systematically study the influence of the phonons on the lasing activity and to discriminate between the phenomena of shifting and shaking .",
    "for this purpose , we will use idealized ensemble shapes ( e.g. , a flat distribution of qd transition energies ) and idealized strain pulses ( e.g. , bipolar or monopolar pulses or monochromatic phonons ) which will allow us to separate the shaking effect from the adiabatic shift in an intuitive way .    by providing a thorough understanding of the coupled phonon - exciton - photon system",
    ", we are not only able to understand the complex laser emission seen in the experiment , but also we lay the foundation to optimize the system , which will then stimulate further studies on phonon control of solid state lasers and pave the way for designing applications .",

    "the paper closes with some concluding remarks in sec  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "to model the qd laser system we employ a semiclassical laser model in the usual dipole , rotating wave and slowly varying amplitude approximation  @xcite .",
    "the growth process of the qd ensemble typically leads to a gaussian size distribution .",
    "this directly translates into a finite spectral width of the qd ensemble , which is modeled by an ensemble of transition energies @xmath2 . at each @xmath2",
    "we model the system as a three level system .",

    "the laser transition is between the exciton state @xmath3 and the ground state @xmath4 with the transition energy @xmath2 .",
    "the pump level @xmath5 can be thought of as wetting layer state .",
    "the qd ensemble is placed in a microcavity with resonance frequency @xmath6 .",
    "the influence of the strain field that acts on the qds is modeled in terms of a deformation potential coupling to the exciton .",
    "this means that we introduce the deformation potential coupling strength @xmath7 and assume that the transition energy of each qd is shifted from the unstrained value @xmath2 to a time - dependent value @xmath8 , the shift being proportional to the strain value @xmath9 at time @xmath10 , according to @xmath11 basically this model is motivated by the fact that the band gap of the qd semiconductor material changes proportional to the strain and that the wavelength of the phonons is much larger than the size of the qds , such that the the strain value does not vary over the size of the dot ensemble .",
    "typical values for the deformation potential are in the range of @xmath12  ev  @xcite . together with the strain amplitudes in the experiment [ see fig .  [",

    "we will directly treat the product @xmath13 as a strain mediated energy shift . in the current form of the strain control",
    "it is a good assumption to treat the phonons as plane waves hitting the qd layer perpendicularly , such that at a given time @xmath10 all qds in the ensemble experience the same shift .",
    "one could also think of phonon wave packets that arrive at a certain angle at the qd layer or that travel in - plane through the qd ensemble , where qds at different positions would interact with different parts of the strain wave .",
    "for the description of such a scenario a spatio - temporal extension of the qd laser model would be needed  @xcite .     ]",
    "the dynamics of the whole system , including the laser field amplitude @xmath14 , the microscopic polarization @xmath15 for every considered exciton frequency @xmath16 and the occupations of all levels @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 is given by the following standard equations  @xcite :    @xmath20    [ eq : qdl ]    where @xmath21 is the spectral distribution describing the qd ensemble , @xmath22 the coupling strength between the polarization and the laser field , and @xmath23 the detuning between the cavity mode and the considered exciton transition .",

    "[ ] it was shown that the strongest laser response on the strain field happens for pump rates that are slightly above the threshold pump rate , which for our system parameters is approximately the spontaneous decay rate @xmath27 .",
    "thus we define a shifted pump rate as @xmath37",
    "the main goal for the paper is to separate various effects which contribute to the modulation of the laser output , in particular the shaking and the adiabatic shift . to eliminate the latter one , we first consider a qd ensemble in which the number of dots in resonance with the cavity mode remains constant when the exciton energy varies .",
    "the gaussian ensemble , will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : gauss ] .      to analyze the shaking effect we choose an idealized ensemble shape being rectangular with the spectral qd density @xmath38 where @xmath39 is",

    "[ fig : rect_pulse](a ) .",
    "the cavity resonance is supposed to be initially in the center of the ensemble .",
    "since the pumping is taken to be the same for the whole ensemble , an energetic shift of the ensemble will bring highly occupied qd excitons into resonance with the cavity and therefore influence the output of the laser .",

    "the strain pulse arrives , when the laser has reached its stationary state .",
    "we choose the pump rate to @xmath52  s@xmath32 . the laser intensity @xmath0 normalized to the intensity without any strain @xmath1 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rect_pulse](a ) as a function of time @xmath10 .",
    "the laser output is dominated by two enhancement peaks that reach values of about @xmath53 .",
    "the maxima are at the positions of the extrema of the strain pulse , marked by red arrows .",
    "after the pulse the intensity shows a period of attenuation around @xmath54  ps and eventually goes back to 1 .    to get a better insight into the origin of the variation of the laser output fig .",
    "[ fig : rect_pulse](b ) and ( c ) show the inversion density @xmath48 as a function of time @xmath10 and exciton energy @xmath2 . because in the equation of motion for the microscopic polarization @xmath15 [ eq .  ] only the detuning between the cavity mode and the considered qd energy @xmath55 enters , it is not important for the simulation if the qd transition energies are shifted by the strain according to eq .   or if all qd transitions stay at the same energies and the cavity resonance is shifted by the same amount but in the opposite energetic direction .",
    "thus it is possible to present the dynamics of the inversion density of the qd ensemble either with a fixed cavity resonance energy and a strain affected qd ensemble ( i.e. , as a function of @xmath56 ) or with a fixed ensemble distribution ( @xmath57 ) and a cavity resonance that is shifted by the strain dynamics .",
    "the former is realized in fig .",
    "[ fig : rect_pulse](b ) and the latter in ( c ) .",
    "both representations are shown here because in either case different aspects of the inversion dynamics can be explained more easily . before the strain pulse , i.e. , at @xmath58  ps both inversion density representations look the same .",
    "the region between @xmath59 and 50  mev depicts the spectrum of the qd ensemble , for larger energies there are no qds which results in a vanishing density ( black ) . at the edges of the ensemble the qds",
    "are highly occupied , which is seen by the bright color , but in the center , at the position of the cavity mode , an energy range with reduced inversion densities appears .",
    "this depression of the exciton occupation represents the qds that contribute to the laser process and is called _",
    "spectral hole_. during the interaction with the strain pulse , i.e. , for @xmath60  ps , the actual influence of the strain can be seen .",
    "let us first focus on the representation in ( b ) .",
    "the energetic position of the ensemble is shifted proportional to the strain amplitude , therefore the complete colored area shifts to larger energies , reaches a maximum shift of @xmath61  mev at @xmath62  ps ( left red arrow ) .",
    "it is then shifted toward smaller energies , reaching again the maximum shift at 1  ps ( right red arrow ) and goes back to its initial position . during the whole process the cavity resonance stays at @xmath63 .",
    "in contrast , the spectral hole does not stay at the energy of the cavity , it rather follows the strain shift of the ensemble toward positive energies . while this happens the shape of the spectral hole is strongly modified .",
    "after the strain pulse at @xmath64  ps the final spectral hole consists of multiple minima distributed symmetrically around the cavity at 0  mev . for increasing times the outer inversion minima decay and only the original spectral hole remains when the laser comes back to its steady state .",
    "we now come back to the laser output in ( a ) and directly compare the enhancement and attenuation features with the inversion density .",
    "the red arrows mark both the maxima of the laser intensity and the extrema of the strain shift . at the arrowheads two dark spots appear in ( b ) , which represent very small or even negative values of @xmath48 .",
    "note that due to clarity the color scale in fig .",
    "[ fig : rect_pulse](b ) and ( c ) starts at @xmath65 , although negative values may appear when stimulated emission de - occupies a qd exciton .",
    "the origin of these strong spectral holes can best be explained in the picture of a fixed ensemble and a strain shifted cavity resonance in ( c ) .",
    "the fact that the edges of the colored area are fixed shows that the qd energies are unaffected by the strain .",
    "due to the strain shift of the cavity resonance it first moves to smaller energies and reaches @xmath66  mev at @xmath67  ps , which is marked by the left red arrow .",
    "we see that at this time the strong deepening of the spectral hole happens .",
    "the reason is , that the cavity moves toward highly occupied qds faster than they can fully react on the presence of the cavity mode .",
    "when the cavity shift reaches its maximum at @xmath62  ps , the shift is sufficiently slow for the qds that are in resonance with the cavity during that time window to emit stimulatedly into the laser mode . due to this switch - on process of qds that were previously not in resonance with the laser mode",
    ", the output increases drastically resulting in the first peak in ( a ) .",
    "the same happens for the second turning point of the strain shift at @xmath68  ps .",
    "after the strain has shifted the cavity out of resonance again the qds in these two strong spectral holes are significantly detuned from the laser mode and can not contribute to the laser output any more .",
    "the re - occupation of the dots appears as decay of the spectral holes .",
    "the last feature of the laser intensity in ( a ) is the attenuation between @xmath69 and 16  ps . after the strain pulse ,",
    "the cavity resonance is again at the center of the ensemble and the qds in the region of the additional outer spectral holes do not contribute to the laser process any longer .",
    "this means that only the qds within the spectral hole at @xmath70  ps , i.e. , before the strain pulse , are important for the intensity .",
    "a close look at the shape of the central spectral hole reveals that it is less deep than before the strain pulse . during the pulse",
    "the qd excitons within the spectral hole were detuned from the cavity resonance and are therefore higher occupied directly after the pulse .",
    "they need a while to reach the stationary laser state , which has smaller inversions , i.e. , a deeper spectral hole .",
    "this also results in the reduced intensity .",
    "the original stationary laser state recovers completely at @xmath71  ps .    as a side remark",
    ", we note that for strain pulses that are significantly longer in time ( @xmath72  ps ) the spectral hole can adiabatically follow the shift of the ensemble , such that always the same amount of qds takes part in the laser process and the intensity stays constant ( not shown ) .          we have seen that a shift of the qd ensemble on the picosecond time scale brings the laser system out of equilibrium and results in variations of the output intensity on the order of tenfold enhancements . in the second example",
    "we tackle the question , under which conditions a laser system driven by a harmonic strain perturbation reaches a new stationary state .    besides the fundamental interest ,",
    "such a study is well connected to recent research .",
    "monochromatic coherent phonons can be optically created in semiconductor superlattices .",
    "a recent experiment demonstrates narrow band phonon generation with frequencies of more than 2  thz  @xcite , which is comparable to the values studied in the following . to make maximum use of these vibrations , one can tailor a phononic cavity for the desired phonon frequency and embed it into the optical resonator  in this way the generated phonons become confined in the same place as the active medium  @xcite . in passive optomechanical resonators",
    "the localization of phonons and photons results in an enhanced coupling strength  @xcite , while in a laser device the resonant strain field leads to a harmonic modulation of the lasing emission  @xcite .",
    "we model the harmonic strain field by :    @xmath73    i.e. , the harmonic strain oscillation is smoothly switched on between @xmath74 and @xmath43 , where @xmath75 is the period of the strain frequency @xmath76 .",
    "the laser has reached its stationary output long before the strain oscillation is switched on .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rect_harm ] three different strain frequencies are shown for a pump rate of @xmath52  s@xmath32 . in the left column [ ( a ) ,",

    "we start the discussion of the harmonically driven laser system with @xmath77  ps @xmath32 in ( a ) and ( b ) . in the normalized laser output in ( a ) two features can be distinguished : on the one hand two strong enhancement peaks between @xmath67  ps and 4  ps and on the other hand an oscillation around @xmath80 for @xmath64  ps .",
    "the double peak structure at the beginning looks very much like the dynamics in fig .",
    "[ fig : rect_pulse](a ) and also the behavior of the inversion density in ( b ) shows the above explained appearance of additional spectral holes at higher energies .",
    "thus we conclude that the features are due to the switch on of the strain oscillation .",
    "the new feature is the oscillatory part for @xmath64  ps , which has a period of half the strain period @xmath81  ps . the two red arrows mark maxima of the intensity , which directly correspond to extrema of the strain oscillation . the movement of the cavity resonance can be seen in ( b ) as oscillating dark line around 0  mev . at every antinode of the strain shift",
    "the cavity moves slower and the qds have time to contribute to the laser process more efficiently , which leads to the maxima in the intensity . around the nodes the qd emission can not follow properly and the intensity drops again .",
    "in contrast to the pulsed excitation in fig .  [",
    "fig : rect_pulse](a ) the intensity does not go back to @xmath82 .",
    "this can easily be understood from the dynamics of the outer spectral holes in fig .",
    "[ fig : rect_harm](b ) . like in the pulsed case they decay after the cavity has moved out of resonance with the respective qds but gets back into resonance before the excitons are fully re - occupied .",
    "overall we find a broadening of the spectral hole for all times after the strain field is switched on .",
    "this broadening spreads over the full energy range that is covered by the strain shift of the cavity resonance ( or of the ensemble ) .",
    "the situation shows some decisive differences when increasing the strain frequency to @xmath78  ps@xmath32 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rect_harm](c ) and ( d ) . the normalized intensity in ( c ) is still dominated by a pronounced maximum lasting from @xmath43 to about 7  ps , which arises from the switch - on process of the strain oscillation . at 15  ps",
    "the output has almost reached a stationary value of about @xmath83 .",
    "still the whole curve is covered with an oscillation with half the strain period @xmath84  ps , but with very small amplitudes compared to the previous example . also a very different picture is found for the inversion density in ( d ) .",
    "the oscillation of the cavity resonance in form of a dominating spectral hole is no longer resolved . within the first 5  ps multiple",
    "clearly separated spectral holes appear symmetrically around @xmath85 .",
    "apparently now a wide range of exciton energies contribute to the laser process and lead to the significantly increased , almost constant , laser intensity .",
    "a surprising feature is the appearance of spectral holes at energies larger than the strain shift of @xmath61  mev .",
    "the four outer most lines in the plot are clearly above @xmath86  mev .",
    "we will come back to this point in more detail below .",
    "the appearance of spectral holes at large energies becomes even more striking when increasing the strain frequency further to @xmath79  ps@xmath32 in fig .",

    "three well separated spectral holes show up .",
    "while the one in the middle does not change significantly from the unstrained case two additional ones appear at approximately @xmath87  mev .",
    "for the laser intensity in ( e ) this enlarged number of qds contributing to the laser output leads to a slight increase . obviously the final intensity enhancement is smaller than in the case in ( c ) .",
    "thus it can be expected that the strain frequency follows some sort of resonance condition .    .",
    "different pump rates and strain amplitudes are given .",
    "the crosses mark the positions of the maxima .",

    "figure  [ fig : rect_harm_enhance ] shows the normalized mean final intensity @xmath88 as a function of the strain frequency @xmath76 for different strain amplitudes @xmath45 and pump rates @xmath89 as listed in the picture .",
    "every curve shows a more or less pronounced maximum supporting the prediction , that the strain induced enhancement works most efficiently for a characteristic frequency .",
    "for very small strain frequencies the laser system can follow adiabatically and for very fast oscillations the laser system is too inert and the response reduces again . we also see that for higher strain amplitudes the enhancement factors increase .",
    "this is intuitive because the strain - induced shift reaches a larger amount of qds if the amplitude of the shift is larger . with a close look at the positions of the maxima ( marked by the crosses in fig .",

    "we start the discussion with the special case of vanishing initial detuning @xmath114 . due to the symmetry of the system",
    "the reaction on the strain pulse does not depend on the sign of the shift .",
    "the results for the normalized laser intensity are shown in fig .",

    "we see that the laser output is first increased , then decreased and increased another time during the time of the strain pulse .",
    "we directly compare these dynamics with the behavior of the inversion density in ( b ) , which is here shown for a fixed cavity resonance , i.e. , against the energy @xmath115 .",

    "we clearly see the spectral hole in the center of the gaussian qd distribution , during the pulse the ensemble shifts to smaller energies and therefore out of resonance with the cavity . without the shaking effect",

    "however , we contrary first observe an increase of the intensity in ( a ) , which proves that the shaking effect outweighs the adiabatic response due to the reduced number of resonant qds . likewise the attenuation of the output can be understood because it happens at the maximum of the strain shift , which happens much slower and the adiabatic shift becomes more important . during the second half of the strain pulse",
    "the ensemble is brought back into resonance with the cavity , such that the shaking effect and the adiabatic shift work in the same direction and result in a slightly stronger enhancement in ( a ) . as can be seen in ( b ) around @xmath43 the inversion density increases while the ensemble is out of resonance with the cavity . when these re - occupied dots get back into the cavity mode they can emit and contribute to the laser process .    in the other two examples",
    "the initial detuning is chosen in the same order as the strain amplitude . in ( c ) and",
    "( d ) the initial detuning is @xmath116  mev , but the strain shifts the ensemble further away from cavity . for the laser intensity in ( c )",
    "this means a complete quenching at @xmath43 . during the second half of the strain pulse the laser",
    "is switched on again exhibiting the characteristic relaxation oscillations before reaching its original intensity . in the inversion density in ( d )",
    "we see that the spectral hole is now at the edge of the ensemble . during the strain pulse the ensemble shifts to even smaller energies and the spectral hole in the cavity resonance vanishes , leaving an almost completely occupied gaussian ensemble .",

    "to conclude , the strain leads to a switch - off of the laser due to the adiabatic reduction of resonant qds .",

    "ps we also find a significant reduction of the output .",
    "looking at the inversion density in ( f ) we see that initially the main part of the ensemble is on the other side of the cavity .",
    "the strain pulse then reduces the detuning .",
    "it is clearly visible that most of the qds become de - occupied around @xmath43 .",
    "when this large number of qds emits stimulatedly into the cavity mode , the large enhancement in ( e ) is observed .",
    "also while the ensemble is shifted back to the original detuning situation at @xmath54  ps , the laser field is still enhanced . on the other hand due to the previous stimulated emissions",
    "there is a reduced number of occupied excitons , which are not capable of feeding the laser process",
    ". therefore the intensity drops below @xmath1 , while enough dots recover their occupation .",
    "the system reaches its initial stationary value after @xmath118  ps .      in this part",

    "[ fig : gauss_harm](b ) we see the laser intensity as a function of time @xmath10 and detuning @xmath122 normalized with respect to the strain energy @xmath97 . before the switch - on of the strain oscillation , i.e. , for @xmath123  ps , we find an approximately gaussian profile of the emission intensity , which directly resembles the ensemble shape because the laser intensity increases with the number of resonant qds . when the strain field is switched on additional yellow lines appear at multiples of the strain energy .",
    "this shows that the laser system also works in a completely phonon assisted situation .",
    "a close look at the intensity amplitudes of the assisted lines shows that they are less strong than the central resonant one .",
    "when the strain field is switched on at @xmath43 also the central line is significantly narrowed due to the interaction with the phonons , but recovers almost completely after 150  ps . the lines at @xmath124 appear later , because it takes more time for the system to start and reach the final output .",
    "here it is more clearly visible that their intensity is less strong , reaching only half the resonant amplitude .     as a function of time and initial detuning @xmath122 normalized to the strain energy @xmath97 .",

    "with our newly gained knowledge we close the discussion by shortly revisiting the experimental results in fig .",
    "[ fig : motiv ] .",
    "let us first comment on the complex strain pulse , which is obtained in the experiment .",
    "its dynamics arises from the propagation of the phonons through the sample before reaching the active medium .",
    "the injection of the acoustic pulse happens via an intense picosecond laser pulse that rapidly heats an aluminum film as shown on the left side of fig .",
    "[ fig : motiv](a ) .",
    "the heating is associated with an expansion of the film , which launches a phonon wave packet with an approximately gaussian lattice displacement into the substrate material .",
    "this lattice displacement corresponds to a bipolar strain pulse of about 20  ps . due to",
    "the large strain amplitudes on the order of @xmath125 nonlinear effects have to be taken into account in the phonon propagation through the substrate  @xcite . during this propagation solitons form and the strain pulse",
    "gets stretched over a few tens of picoseconds . before reaching the qd layer of the sample the strain pulse",
    "is additionally modified by passing through the bottom dbr [ left one in fig .",
    "[ fig : motiv](a ) ] .",
    "multiple transmission and reflection processes in the dbr then lead to the final dynamics in fig .",
    "[ fig : motiv](b ) that lasts several hundreds of picoseconds .    in the laser output [ fig .",
    "[ fig : motiv](c ) ] we find first a strong enhancement peak followed by 100  ps of almost complete quenching .",
    "after 200  ps the output is dominated by a harmonic oscillation , reproduced well by the simulation [ fig .",
    "[ fig : motiv](d ) ] . in the presented example",
    "the cavity mode is positively detuned from the qd ensemble , such that negative strain values reduce the detuning and positive ones increase it .",
    "due to our previous analysis we are now able to attribute these variations to the two effects : through the first negative solitonic strain pulses both  shaking and shifting  lead to an increase of the laser output as it was found in fig .",
    "[ fig : gauss_puls](e ) .",
    "the following attenuation then has two reasons . on the one hand",
    "many qds were de - occupied during the first intensity peak and the initial intensity can not be preserved any longer . on the other hand",
    "the mean strain value is positive , which reduced the laser output naturally through the adiabatic shift .",
    "the harmonic oscillation in the last part in fig .",
    "[ fig : motiv](b ) arises from the adiabatic shift due to the slow harmonic oscillation of the strain field .",
    "in summary we have presented a systematic study of the qd laser emission properties driven by coherent phonons . by choosing a rectangular ensemble",
    "the adiabatic shift of the ensemble could be suppressed and the shaking effect was analyzed separately .",
    "we have shown that the intensity enhancement depends strongly on the time scale of the phonon field . for harmonic strain oscillations",
    "phonon assisted transitions contribute to the laser output . for a realistic gaussian ensemble",
    "both effects take part in the process .",
    "we have found that depending on the initial detuning , the intensity could either be significantly enhanced or switched - off on an ultra fast time scale .",
    "the detailed study of the different effects allowed us to obtain a deep understanding of the details of the measured intensity modulations . with this",
    ", it will be possible to tailor the nanostructure as well as the phonon pulses to reach a desired control of the laser output , may it be a long lasting amplification or a brief enhancement with a strong amplitude . hence , our work paves the way for further research both on the theoretical side , e.g. for further optimization , and on the experimental side , e.g. to fabricate and measure different structures and phonon pulses .",
