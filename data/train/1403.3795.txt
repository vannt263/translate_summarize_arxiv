    "many physical , technological , biological , and social systems can be modeled as networks , which in their simplest form are represented by graphs .",
    "a ( static and single - layer ) graph consists of a set of entities ( called `` vertices '' or `` nodes '' ) and pairwise interactions ( called `` edges '' or `` links '' ) between those vertices  @xcite .",
    "graphical representations of data have led to numerous insights in the natural , social , and information sciences ; and the study of networks has in turn borrowed ideas from all of these areas  @xcite .    in general , networks can be described using a combination of local , global , and `` meso - scale '' perspectives .",
    "to investigate meso - scale structures ",
    ", intermediate - sized structures that are responsible for `` coupling '' local properties , such as whether triangles close , and global properties such as graph diameter  a fundamental primitive in many applications entails partitioning graphs into meaningful and/or useful sets of nodes  @xcite .",
    "the most popular form of such a partitioning procedure , in which one attempts to find relatively dense sets of nodes that are relatively sparsely connected to other sets , is known as `` community detection ''  @xcite .",
    "myriad methods have been developed to algorithmically detect communities  @xcite ; and these efforts have led to insights in applications such as committee and voting networks in political science  @xcite , friendship networks at universities and other schools  @xcite , protein - protein interaction networks  @xcite , granular materials  @xcite , amorphous materials  @xcite , brain and behavioral networks in neuroscience  @xcite , collaboration patterns  @xcite , human communication networks  @xcite , human mobility patterns  @xcite , and so on .",
    "the motivation for the present work is the observation that it can be very challenging to find meaningful medium - sized or large communities in large networks  @xcite .",
    "much of the large body of work on algorithmically identifying communities in networks has been applied successfully either to find communities in small networks or to find small communities in large networks  @xcite , but it has been much less successful at finding meaningful medium - sized and large communities in large networks  .",
    "there are many reasons that it is difficult to find `` good '' large communities in large networks .",
    "we discuss several such reasons in the following paragraphs .",
    "first , although it is typical to think about communities as sets of nodes with `` denser '' interactions among its members than between its members and the rest of a network , the literature contains neither a consensus definition of community nor a consensus on a precise formalization of what constitutes a `` good '' community  @xcite .",
    "second , the popular formalizations of a `` community '' are computationally intractable , and there is little precise understanding or theoretical control on how closely popular heuristics to compute communities approximate the exact answers in those formulations  @xcite .",
    "indeed , community structure itself is typically `` defined '' operationally via the output of a community - detection algorithm , rather than as the solution to a precise optimization problem or via some other mathematically precise notion  @xcite .",
    "third , many large networks are extremely sparse  @xcite and thus have complicated structures that pose significant challenges for the algorithmic detection of communities via the optimization of objective functions  @xcite .",
    "this is especially true when attempting to develop algorithms that scale well enough to be usable in practice on large networks  @xcite .",
    "fourth , the fact that it is difficult to visualize large networks complicates the validation of community - detection methods in such networks .",
    "one possible means of validation is to compare algorithmically - obtained communities with known `` ground truth '' communities .",
    "however , notions of ground truth can be weak in large networks  @xcite , and one rarely possesses even a weak notion of ground truth for most networks . indeed , in many cases , one should not expect a real ( or realistic ) large network to possess a single feature that ( to leading order ) dominates large - scale latent structure in a network .",
    "thus , comparing the output of community - detection algorithms to `` ground truth '' in practice is most appropriate for obtaining coarse insights into how a network might be organized into social or functional groups of nodes  @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "different notions and/or formalizations of `` community '' concepts might be appropriate in different contexts  @xcite , so it is desirable to formulate flexible methods that can incorporate different perspectives .",
    "fifth , community - detection algorithms often have subtle and counterintuitive properties as a function of sizes of their inputs and/or outputs .",
    "for example , the community - size `` resolution limit '' of the popular modularity objective function is a fundamental consequence of the additive form of that objective function , but it only became obvious to people after it was explicitly pointed out  @xcite .",
    "motivated by these observations , we consider the question of community quality as a function of the size ( i.e. , number of nodes ) of a purported community .",
    "that is , we are concerned with questions such as the following .",
    "( 1 ) what is the relationship between communities of different sizes in a given network ? in particular , for a given network and a given community - quality objective , are larger communities `` better '' or `` worse '' than smaller communities ?",
    "( 2 ) what is an appropriate way to think about medium - sized and large communities in large networks ? in particular , how do smaller communities `` fit together '' into medium - sized and larger communities ? ( 3 ) more generally , what effect do the answers to these questions have on downstream tasks that are of primary concern when modeling data using networks ?",
    "for example , what effect do they have on processes such as viral propagation or the diffusion of information on networks ?    by considering a suite of networks and using several related notions of community quality",
    ", we identify several scenarios that can arise in realistic networks .    1 .",
    "* small communities are better than large communities . * in this first scenario , for which there is an upward - sloping _ network community profile _",
    "( ncp ; see the discussion below ) , a network has small groups of nodes that correspond more closely than any large groups to intuitive ideas of what constitutes a good community .",
    "small and large communities are similarly good or bad . * in this second scenario , for which an ncp is roughly flat , the most community - like small groups of nodes in a network have similar community quality scores to the most community - like large groups .",
    "* large communities are better than small communities . * in this third scenario , for which an ncp is downward - sloping , a network has large groups of nodes that are more community - like ( i.e. , `` better '' in some sense ) than any small groups .",
    "although the third scenario is the one that has an intuitive isoperimetric interpretation and thus corresponds most closely with peoples intuition when they develop and validate community - detection algorithms , one of our main conclusions is that most large realistic networks correspond to the first or second scenarios .",
    "this is consistent with recent results on network community structure using related approaches  @xcite as well as somewhat different approaches  @xcite , and it also helps illustrate the importance of considering community structures with groups that have large overlaps . for more on this ,",
    "see our discussions below .",
    "one of the main tools that we use to justify the above observations and to interpret the implications of community structure in a network is a _ network community profile ( ncp ) _ , which was originally introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . given a community `` quality '' score  i.e . , a formalization of the idea of a `` good '' community  an ncp plots the score of the best community of a given size as a function of community size .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite considered the community quality notion of conductance and employed various algorithms to approximate it . in subsequent work  @xcite , many other notions of community quality have also been used to compute ncps .    in the present paper , we compute ncps using three different procedures to identify communities",
    ".    1 .   * diffusion - based dynamics .",
    "* first , we consider a diffusion - based dynamics ( called the aclcut method ; see the discussion below ) from the original ncp analysis  @xcite that has an interpretation that good communities correspond to bottlenecks in the associated dynamics .",
    "* spectral - based optimization . * second , we consider a spectral - based optimization rule ( called the movcut method ; see below ) that is a locally - biased analog of the usual global spectral graph partitioning problem  @xcite .",
    "* geodesic - based dynamics .",
    "* finally , we consider a geodesic - based spreading process ( called the egonet method ; see the discussion below ) that has an interpretation that nodes in a good community are connected by short paths that emanate from a seed node  @xcite .",
    "we describe these three procedures in more detail in appendix[sxn : measures ] . for now , we note that the first and the third procedures have a natural interpretation as defining communities operationally as the output of an underlying dynamics , and the first and second procedures allow us to compare this operational approach with an optimization - based approach .",
    "viewed from this perspective , the computation of network community structure depends fundamentally on three things : actual network structure , the dynamics or application of interest , and the initial conditions or network region of interest .",
    "although there are differences between the aforementioned three community - identification methods , these methods all take the perspective that a network s community structure depends not only on the connectivity of its nodes but also on ( 1 ) the region of a large network in which one is interested and ( 2 ) the application of interest .",
    "the perspective in point ( 1 ) contrasts with the prevalent view of community structure as arising simply from network structure  @xcite , but it is consistent with the notion of dynamical systems depending fundamentally on their initial conditions , and it is crucial in many applications ( e.g. , both social  @xcite and biological contagions  @xcite ) .",
    "for example , facebook s data team and its collaborators have demonstrated that one can view facebook as a collection of egocentric networks that have been patched together into a network whose global structure is very sparse  @xcite .",
    "the above three community - identification methods have the virtue of combining the prevalent structural perspective with the idea that one is often interested in structure that is located `` near '' ( in terms of both network topology and edge weights ) an exogenously - specified `` seed set '' of nodes  @xcite .",
    "the perspective in point ( 2 ) underscores the fact that one should not expect answers to be `` universal . ''",
    "the differences between the aforementioned three methods lie in the specific dynamical processes that underlie them .",
    "we also note that , although we focus on the measure of community quality known as `` conductance '' ( which is intimately related to the problem of characterizing the mixing rates of random walks  @xcite ) , one can view other quality functions ( e.g. , based on non - conservative dynamics  @xcite or geodesic - based dynamics  @xcite ) as solving other problems , and they thus can reveal different aspects of community structure in networks .",
    "the global ncps that we compute from the three community - identification procedures are rather similar in some respects , suggesting that the characteristic features of ncps are actual features of networks and not just artifacts of a particular way of sampling local communities .",
    "however , we observe significant differences in their local behaviors because they are based on different dynamical processes . in concert with other recent work ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) ,",
    "our results with these three procedures suggest that `` local '' methods that focus on finding communities centered around an exogenously - specified seed node ( or seed set of nodes ) might have better theoretical grounding and more practical utility than other methods for community detection .",
    "our `` local '' ( and `` size - resolved '' ) perspective on community structure also yields several other interesting insights . by design",
    ", it allows us to discern how community structure depends both on the seed node and on the size scales and time scales of a dynamical process running on a network .",
    "similar perspectives were discussed in recent work on detecting communities in networks using markov processes  @xcite , and our approach is in the spirit of research on dynamical systems more generally , as bottlenecks to diffusion and other dynamics depend fundamentally on initial conditions .",
    "local information algorithms are also an important approach for many other optimization problems and for practical purposes such as friend recommendation systems in online social networks @xcite .",
    "moreover , taking a local perspective on community structure is also consistent with the sociological idea of egocentric networks ( and with real - world experience of individuals , such as users of facebook  @xcite , who experience their personal neighborhood of a social network ) .",
    "the local community experienced by a given node should be similarly locally - biased , and we demonstrate this feature quantitatively for several real networks .",
    "using our perspective , we also demonstrate subtle yet fundamental differences between different networks : some networks have high - quality communities of different sizes ( especially small ones ) , whereas others do not possess communities of any size that give bottlenecks to diffusion - based dynamics .",
    "this is consistent with , and helps explain , prior direct observations of networks in which algorithmically computed communities seemed to have little or no effect on several dynamical processes @xcite .",
    "more generally and importantly , whether small or large communities are `` better '' with respect to some measure of community quality has significant consequences not only for algorithms that attempt to identify communities but also for the dynamics of processes such as viral propagation and information diffusion .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . because our approach to examining network communities is uncommon in the physics literature",
    ", we start in section[sxn : prelim ] with an informal description of our approach .",
    "we then introduce ncps in section[sxn : ncp ] . in section[sxn : main - empirical ] , we present our main empirical results on community quality as a function of size , and we provide a detailed comparison of our three community - identification procedures when applied to real networks .",
    "this illustrates the three distinct scenarios of community quality versus community size that we described above . in section[sxn : benchmarks ] , we illustrate the behavior of these methods on the well - known lfr benchmark networks that are commonly used to evaluate the performance of community - detection techniques .",
    "we find that their ncps have a characteristic shape for a wide range of parameter values and are unable to reproduce the different scenarios that one observes for real networks .",
    "we then conclude in section[sxn : conc ] with a discussion of our results . in appendix[sxn : expanders ] , we provide a brief discussion of expander graphs ( a.k.a .",
    "`` expanders '' ) . in appendix[sxn : measures ] , we describe the three specific procedures that we use to identify communities in detail .",
    "appendices[sxn : ncp - mov ] and[sxn : ncp - ego ] contain empirical results for the two methods that we mentioned but did not discuss in detail in section[sxn : main - empirical ] .",
    "in this section , we describe some background and preliminaries that provide the framework that we use to interpret our results on size - resolved community structure in sections[sxn : main - empirical ] and[sxn : benchmarks ] .",
    "we start in section[sxn : prelim - notation ] by defining the notation that we use throughout this paper , and we continue in section[sxn : prelim - looklike ] with a brief discussion of possible ways that a network might `` look like '' if one is interested in its meso - scale or large - scale structure . to convey the basic idea of our approach ,",
    "much of our discussion in this section is informal . in later sections",
    ", we will make these ideas more precise .",
    "we represent each of the networks that we study as an undirected graph .",
    "we consider both weighted and unweighted graphs .",
    "let @xmath0 be a connected and undirected graph with node set @xmath1 , edge set @xmath2 , and set @xmath3 of weights on the edges .",
    "let @xmath4 denote the number of nodes , and let @xmath5 denote the number of edges .",
    "the edge @xmath6 has weight @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the ( weighted ) adjacency matrix of @xmath9 .",
    "its components are @xmath10 if @xmath11 and @xmath12 otherwise .",
    "the matrix @xmath13 denotes the diagonal degree matrix of @xmath9 .",
    "its components are @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is called the `` strength '' or `` weighted degree '' of node @xmath16 .",
    "the combinatorial laplacian of @xmath9 is @xmath17 , and the normalized laplacian of @xmath9 is @xmath18 .",
    "a path @xmath19 in @xmath9 is a sequence of edges @xmath20 , such that @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "the length of path @xmath19 is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the length of the edge that connects nodes @xmath16 and @xmath25 . for an unweighted network ,",
    "@xmath26 for all edges . for weighted networks",
    ", @xmath7 is a measure of closeness of the tie between nodes @xmath16 and @xmath25 , a common choice for @xmath27 is @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath29 be the set of all paths between @xmath16 and @xmath25 .",
    "the geodesic distance @xmath30 between nodes @xmath16 and @xmath25 is the length of a shortest path between @xmath16 and @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath31-neighborhood @xmath32 of @xmath16 is the set of all nodes that are at most a distance @xmath31 away from @xmath16 , and the @xmath31-neighborhood of a set of nodes @xmath33 is @xmath34 .      before examining real networks , we start with the following question : what are possible ways that a network can `` look like , '' very roughly if one `` squints '' at it ?",
    "this question is admittedly vague , but the answer to it governs how small - scale network structure `` interacts '' with large - scale network structure , and it informs researchers intuitions and the design decisions that they make when analyzing networks ( and when developing methods to analyze networks ) . as an example of this idea , it should be intuitively clear that if one `` squints '' at the nearest - neighbor @xmath35 network ( i.e. , the uniform lattice of pairs of integers on the euclidean plane ) , then they `` look like '' the euclidean plane @xmath36 .",
    "distances are approximately preserved , and up to boundary conditions and discretization effects , dynamical processes on one approximate the analogous dynamic processes on the other . in the fields of geometric group theory and coarse geometry ,",
    "this intuitive connection between @xmath35 and @xmath36 has been made precise using the notions of coarse embeddings and quasi - isometries  @xcite .     +    establishing quasi - isometric relationships on networks that are expander graphs ( a.k.a .",
    "`` expanders '' ; see appendix[sxn : expanders ] ) is technically brittle  @xcite .",
    "thus , for the present informal discussion , we rely on a simper notion",
    ". suppose that we are interested in the `` best fit '' of the adjacency matrix @xmath37 to a @xmath38 block matrix : @xmath39 where @xmath40 , where the `` 1-vector '' @xmath41 is a column vector of the appropriate dimension that contains a @xmath42 in every entry and @xmath43 .",
    "thus , each block in @xmath37 has uniform values for all its elements , and larger values of @xmath44 correspond to stronger interactions between nodes .",
    "the structure of @xmath37 is then determined based on the relative sizes of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "the various relative sizes of these three scalars have a strong bearing on the structure of the network associated with @xmath37 .",
    "we illustrate several examples in fig.[fig : stylized ] . for the block models that we use for three of its panels",
    ", one block has @xmath48 nodes and the second block has @xmath49 nodes , and a node in block @xmath16 is connected to a node in block @xmath25 with probability @xmath44  @xcite .    *",
    "* low - dimensional structure . * in fig.[fig : stylized - hotdog ] , we illustrate the case in which @xmath50 . in this case , each half of the network interacts with itself more densely than it interacts with the other half of the network .",
    "this `` hot dog '' or `` pancake '' structure corresponds to the situation in which there are two ( or any number , in the case of networks more generally ) dense communities of nodes that are reasonably well - balanced in the sense that each community has roughly the same number of nodes . in this case , the network embeds relatively well in a one - dimensional , two - dimensional , or other low - dimensional space .",
    "spectral clustering or other clustering methods often find meaningful communities in such networks , and one can often readily construct meaningful and interpretable visualizations of network structure .",
    "* * core - periphery structure . * in fig.[fig : stylized - coreper ] , we illustrate the case in which @xmath51 .",
    "this is an example of a network with a density - based `` core - periphery '' structure  @xcite . in these cases",
    ", there is a core set of nodes that are relatively well - connected amongst themselves as well as to a peripheral set of nodes that interact very little amongst themselves . *",
    "* expander or complete graph .",
    "* in fig.[fig : stylized - expander ] , we illustrate the case in which @xmath52 .",
    "this corresponds to a network with little or no discernible structure .",
    "for example , if @xmath53 , then the graph is a clique ( i.e. , the complete graph ) .",
    "alternatively , if the graph is a constant - degree expander , then @xmath54 . as discussed in appendix[sxn : expanders ] , constant - degree expanders are the metric spaces that embed least well in low - dimensional euclidean spaces . in terms of the idealized block model in fig.[fig : stylized ] , they `` look like '' complete graphs , and partitioning them would not yield network structure that one should expect to construe as meaningful .",
    "informally , they are largely unstructured when viewed at large size scales . * * bipartite structure . * in fig.[fig : stylized - bipartite ] , we illustrate the case in which @xmath55 .",
    "this corresponds to a bipartite or nearly - bipartite graph .",
    "such networks arise , e.g. , when there are two different types of nodes , such that one type of node connects only to ( or predominantly to ) nodes of the other type  @xcite .",
    "most methods for algorithmic detection of communities have been developed and validated using the intuition that networks have some sort of low - dimensional structure @xcite .",
    "as an example , consider the infamous zachary karate club network  @xcite , which we show in fig.[fig : stylized - hotdog ] . this well - known benchmark graph , which seems to be an almost obligatory example to discuss in papers that discuss community structure @xcite , clearly `` looks like '' it has a nice low - dimensional structure .",
    "for example , there is a clearly identifiable left half and right half , and two - dimensional visualizations of the network ( such as that in fig.[fig : stylized - hotdog ] ) highlight that bipartition .",
    "indeed , the zachary karate club network possesses well - balanced and ( quoting herbert simon @xcite ) `` nearly decomposable '' communities ; and the nodes in each community are more densely connected to nodes in the same community than they are to nodes in the other community .",
    "relatedly , reordering the nodes of the zachary karate club appropriately yields an adjacency - matrix representation with an almost block - diagonal structure with two blocks ( as typified by the cartoon in fig.[fig : stylized - hotdog ] ) ; and any reasonable community - detection algorithm should be able to find ( exactly or approximately ) the two communities .    another well - known network that ( slightly less obviously ) `` looks like '' it has a low - dimensional structure is a so - called caveman network , which we illustrate later ( in fig.[fig : ncp - cavemangraph ] ) .",
    "arguably , a caveman network has many more communities than the zachary karate club , so details such as whether an algorithm `` should '' split it into two or a somewhat larger number of reasonably well - balanced communities might be different than in the zachary karate club network .",
    "however , a caveman network also has a natural well - balanced partition that respects intuitive community structure .",
    "reasonable two - dimensional visualizations of this network ( such as the one that we present in fig.[fig : ncp - cavemangraph ] ) shed light on that structure ; and any reasonable community - detection algorithm can be adjusted to find ( exactly or approximately ) the expected communities . in this paper , we will demonstrate that most realistic networks do _ not _ `` look like '' these small examples . instead",
    ", realistic networks are often poorly - approximated by low - dimensional structures ( e.g. , with a small number of relatively well - balanced communities , each of which is more densely connected internally than it is with the rest of the network ) .",
    "realistic networks often include substructures that more closely resemble core - periphery graphs or expander graphs ( see fig.[fig : stylized - coreper ] and fig.[fig : stylized - expander ] ) ; and networks that partition into nice nearly - decomposable communities tend to be the exception rather than typical  @xcite .",
    "recall from section[sxn : intro ] that an ncp measures the quality of the best possible community of a given size as a function of the size of the purported community @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we provide a brief description of ncps and how we will use it .",
    "we start with the definition of conductance and the original conductance - based definition of an ncp from ref .",
    "@xcite , and we then discuss our extensions of such ideas . for more details on conductance and ncps ,",
    "see refs .",
    "if @xmath0 is a graph with weighted adjacency matrix @xmath37 , then the `` volume '' between two sets @xmath56 and @xmath57 of nodes ( i.e. , @xmath58 ) equals the total weight of edges with one end in @xmath56 and one end in @xmath57 .",
    "that is , @xmath59 in this case , the `` volume '' of a set @xmath60 of nodes is @xmath61 in other words , the set volume equals the total weight of edges that are attached to nodes in the set .",
    "the volume @xmath62 between a set @xmath33 and its complement @xmath63 has a natural interpretation as the `` surface area '' of the `` boundary '' between @xmath33 and @xmath63 . in this study ,",
    "a set @xmath33 is a hypothesized community .",
    "informally , the conductance of a set @xmath33 of nodes is the `` surface area '' of that hypothesized community divided by `` volume '' ( i.e. , size ) of that community . from this perspective , studying community structure amounts to an exploration of the isoperimetric structure of @xmath9 .    somewhat more formally , the _ conductance of a set of nodes _",
    "@xmath60 is @xmath64 thus , smaller values of conductance correspond to better communities .",
    "the _ conductance of a graph _",
    "@xmath9 is the minimum conductance of any subset of nodes : @xmath65 computing the conductance @xmath66 of an arbitrary graph is an intractable problem ( in the sense that the associated decision problem is np - hard  @xcite ) , but this quantity can be approximated by the second smallest eigenvalue @xmath67 of the normalized laplacian @xcite .",
    "if the `` surface area to volume '' ( i.e. , isoperimetric ) interpretation captures the notion of a good community as a set of nodes that is connected more densely internally than with the remainder of a network , then computing the solution to eq .",
    "leads to the `` best '' ( in this sense ) community of any size in the network .    instead of defining a community quality score in terms of the best community of any size , it is useful to define a community quality score in terms of the best community of a given size @xmath31 as a function of the size @xmath31 . to do this , ref .",
    "@xcite introduced the idea of a _ network community profile ( ncp ) _ as the lower envelope of the conductance values of communities of a given size : @xmath68 an ncp plots a community quality score ( which , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we take to be the set conductance of communities ) of the best possible community of size @xmath31 as a function of @xmath31 . clearly , it is also intractable to compute the quantity @xmath69 in eq . exactly .",
    "previous work has used spectral - based and flow - based approximation algorithms to approximate it  @xcite .    to gain insight into how to understand an ncp and what it reveals about network structure ,",
    "consider fig.[fig : ncp ] .",
    "in fig.[fig : ncp - possiblencps ] , we illustrate three possible ways that an ncp can behave . in each case",
    ", we are using conductance as a measure of community quality .",
    "* * upward - sloping ncp . * in this case , small communities are `` better '' than large communities . * * flat ncp .",
    "* in this case , community quality is independent of size .",
    "( as illustrated in this figure , the quality tends to be comparably poor for all sizes . ) * * downward - sloping ncp . * in this case , large communities are `` better '' than small communities .    for ease of visualization and computational considerations ,",
    "we only show ncps for communities up to half of the size of a network .",
    "an ncp for very large communities that we do not show in figures as a result of this choice roughly mirrors that for small communities , as the complement of a good small community is a good large community because of the inherent symmetry in conductance ( see eq . ) .",
    "in fig.[fig : ncp - bigncp ] , we show an ncp of a livejournal network from ref .",
    "it demonstrates an empirical fact about a wide range of large social and information networks : there exist good small conductance - based communities , but there do not exist any good large conductance - based communities in many such networks .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite ) for more empirical evidence that large social and information networks tend not to have large communities with low conductances . on the contrary",
    ", fig.[fig : ncp - cavemangraph ] illustrates a small toy network  a so - called `` caveman network''formed from several small cliques connected by rewiring one edge from each clique to create a ring  @xcite .",
    "as illustrated by its downward - sloping ncp in fig.[fig : ncp - cavemanncp ] , this network possesses good conductance - based communities , and large communities are better than small ones .",
    "one obtains a similar downward - sloping ncp for the zachary karate club network  @xcite as well as for many other networks for which there exist meaningful visualizations  @xcite . the wide use of networks that have interpretable visualizations ( such as the zachary karate club and planted partition models  @xcite with balanced communities ) to help develop and evaluate methods for community detection and other procedures can lead to a strong selection bias when evaluating the quality of those methods .",
    "we now consider the relationship between the phenomena illustrated in fig.[fig : ncp ] and the idealized block models of fig.[fig : stylized ] . as a concrete example , fig.[fig : stylized_ncp ] shows the ncps for the example networks in the right panels of fig.[fig : ncp ] .",
    "first , note that the best partitions consist roughly of well - balanced communities in the low - dimensional case of figs.[fig : stylized - hotdog ] and[sfig : ncp_karate ] , and the `` lowest '' point on an ncp tends to be for large community sizes .",
    "thus , an ncp tends to be downward - sloping .",
    "networks with pronounced core - periphery structure  i.e . ,",
    "networks that `` look like '' the example network in fig.[fig : stylized - coreper]tend to have many good small communities but no equally good or better large communities .",
    "this situation arises in many large , extremely sparse networks   @xcite .",
    "the good small communities in such networks are sets of connected nodes in the extremely sparse periphery , and they do not combine to form good , large communities , as they are only connected via a set of core nodes with denser connections than the periphery .",
    "thus , an ncp of a network with core - periphery structure tends to be upward - sloping , as illustrated in figs.[fig : stylized - coreper ] and[sfig : ncp_core_periphery ] .",
    "however , this observation does not apply to all networks with well - defined density - based core - periphery structure .",
    "if the periphery is sufficiently well - connected ( though still much sparser than the core ) , then one no longer observes good , small communities .",
    "such networks act like expanders from the perspective of the behavior of random walkers , so they have a flat ncp .",
    "one can generate examples of such networks by modifying the parameters of the block - model that we used to generate the example network in fig.[fig : stylized - coreper ]  @xcite .    for a complete graph or a degree - homogeneous expander ( see figs.[fig : stylized - expander ]",
    "and[sfig : ncp_expander ] ) , all communities tend to have poor quality , so an ncp is roughly flat .",
    "( see appendix[sxn : expanders ] for a discussion of expander graphs . )    finally , bipartite structure itself does not have any characteristic influence on an ncp .",
    "instead , an ncp of a bipartite network reveals other structure present in a network . for the example network in fig.[fig : stylized - bipartite ] , the two types of nodes are connected uniformly at random , so its ncp ( fig.[sfig : ncp_bipartite ] ) has the characteristic flat shape of an expander .",
    "it is important to discuss the robustness properties of ncps .",
    "these are not obvious a priori , as the ncp is an extremal diagnostic .",
    "importantly , though , the qualitative property of being downward - sloping , upward - sloping , or roughly flat is very robust to the removal of nodes and edges , variations in data generation and preprocessing decisions , and similar sources of perturbation  @xcite .",
    "for example , upward - sloping ncps typically have many small communities of good quality , so losing some communities via noise or some other perturbations has little effect on a realistic ncp . naturally , whether a particular set of nodes achieves a local minimum is not robust to such modifications .",
    "in addition , one can easily construct pathological networks whose ncps are not robust .",
    "it is also important to consider the robustness of a network ncps with respect to the use of conductance versus other measures of community quality .",
    "( recall that many other measures have been proposed to capture the criteria that a good community should be densely - connected internally but sparsely connected to the rest of a network  @xcite . ) indeed , it has been shown that measures that capture both criteria of community quality ( internal density and external sparsity ) behave in a roughly similar manner to conductance - based ncps , whereas measures that capture only one of the two criteria exhibit qualitatively different behavior , typically for rather trivial reasons  @xcite .",
    "although the basic ncp that we have been discussing yields numerous insights about both small - scale and large - scale network structure , it also has important limitations .",
    "for example , an ncp gives no information on the number or density of communities with different community quality scores .",
    "( this contributes to the robustness properties of ncp with respect to perturbations of a network . ) accordingly , the communities that are revealed by an ncp need not be representative of the majority of communities in a network .",
    "however , the extremal features that are revealed by an ncp have important system - level implications for the behavior of dynamical processes on a network : they are responsible for the most severe bottlenecks for associated dynamical processes on networks  @xcite .",
    "another property that is not revealed by an ncp is the internal structure of communities .",
    "recall from eq . that the conductance of a community measures how well ( relative to its size ) that it is separated from the remainder of a network , but it does not consider the internal structure of a community ( except for size and edge density ) . in an extreme case ,",
    "a community with good conductance might even consist of several disjoint pieces .",
    "recent work has addressed how spectral - based approximations to optimizing conductance also approximately optimize measures of internal connectivity  @xcite .",
    "we augment the information from basic ncps with some additional computations . to obtain an indication of a community s internal structure",
    ", we compute the internal conductance of the communities that form an ncp . the _ internal conductance _ @xmath70 of a community @xmath71 is @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the subgraph of @xmath9 induced by nodes in the community @xmath71 .",
    "the internal conductance is equal to the conductance of the best partition into two communities of the network @xmath73 viewed as a graph in isolation . because a good community should be well - separated from the remainder of a network and",
    "also relatively well - connected internally , we expect good communities to have low conductance but high internal conductance .",
    "we thus compute the _ conductance ratio _ @xmath74 to quantify this intuition . a good community should have a small conductance ratio , and thus we also plot so - called _ conductance ratio profiles ( crps ) _  @xcite to illustrate how conductance ratio depends on community size in networks .      in this paper ,",
    "we examine the small - scale , medium - scale , and large - scale community structure using conductance - based ncps and crps .",
    "we employ three different methods , which we introduce in detail in appendix[sxn : measures ] , for sampling an ncp : one based on local diffusion dynamics ( the aclcut method ) , one based on a local spectral optimization ( the movcut method ) , and one based on geodesic distance from a seed node ( the egonet method ) . in each case , we find communities of different sizes , and we then plot the conductance of the best community for each size as a function of size .",
    "an ncp provides a signature of community structure in a network , and we can thereby compare community structure across different networks .",
    "this helps one to discern which properties are attributable predominantly to network structure and which are attributable predominantly to choice of algorithms for community detection .",
    "our approach of comparing community structures in networks using ncps and crps is very general : one can of course follow a similar procedure with other community - quality diagnostics on the vertical axis , other procedures for community generation , and so on .",
    "in this section , we present the results of our empirical evaluation of the small - scale , medium - scale , and large - scale community structure in our example networks .",
    "we will examine six empirical networks in depth .",
    "they fall into three classes : coauthorship networks , facebook networks , and voting similarity networks . for each class , we consider two networks of two different sizes .    * * collaboration graphs . * the two ( unweighted ) coauthorship networks were constructed from papers submitted to the arxiv preprint server in the areas of general relativity and quantum cosmology ( ca - grqc ) and astrophysics ( ca - astroph ) . in each case , two authors are connected by an edge if they coauthored at least one paper , so a paper with @xmath31 authors appears as a @xmath31-clique ( i.e. , a complete @xmath31-node subgraph ) in the network .",
    "these network data are available as part of the stanford network analysis package ( snap ) , and they were examined previously in refs .",
    "@xcite . * * facebook graphs . * the two ( unweighted ) facebook networks are anonymized data sets that consist of a snapshot of `` friendship '' ties on one particular day in september 2005 for two united states ( u.s . )",
    "universities : harvard ( fb - harvard1 ) and johns hopkins ( fb - johns55 ) .",
    "they form a subset of the facebook100 data set from refs .  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the friendship ties , note that we possess node labels for gender and class year as well as numerical identifiers for student or some other ( e.g. , faculty ) status , major , and high school . *",

    ". house of representatives ( us - house ) and u.s .",
    "senate ( us - senate ) .",
    "our construction follows prior work  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we represent these two data sets as `` multilayer '' temporal networks  @xcite .",
    "each layer corresponds to a single two - year congress , and edge weights within a layer represent the voting similarity between two legislators during the corresponding congress . in layer @xmath75 , this yields adjacency elements of @xmath76 , where @xmath77",
    "if both legislators voted the same way on the @xmath78 bill , @xmath79 if they voted in different ways on that bill , @xmath80 is the number of bills on which both legislators voted during that congress , and the sum is over bills .",
    "a tie between the same legislator in consecutive congresses is represented by an interlayer edge with weight @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "( we use @xmath82 ; the effect of changing @xmath81 has been investigated previously  @xcite . )",
    "we represent each multilayer voting network using a single `` supra - adjacency matrix '' ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) in which the different congresses correspond to diagonal blocks and interlayer edges correspond to off - block - diagonal terms in the matrix .",
    "note that throughout this paper we treat the congressional voting graphs at the level of this supra - adjacency matrix , without any additional labeling or distinguished treatment of inter- and intra - layer edges ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we chose these three sets of networks because ( as we will see in later sections ) they have _ very _ different properties with respect to their large - scale versus small - scale community structures .",
    "we thus emphasize that , with respect to the topic of this paper , these six networks are representative of several broad classes of previously - studied networks : ca - grqc and ca - astroph are representative of the snap networks that were examined previously in refs .",
    "@xcite ; both fb - harvard1 and fb - johns55 ( aside from a few very small communities in fb - harvard1 ) are representative of the facebook100 networks that were examined previously in refs .",
    "@xcite ; and us - house and us - senate give examples of networks ( that are larger than the zachary karate club and caveman networks ) on which conventional notions of and algorithms for community detection have been validated successfully  @xcite .    in table[tab : data_summary ] , we provide summary statistics for each of the six networks . we give the numbers of nodes and edges in the largest connected component , the mean degree / strength ( @xmath83 ) , the second - smallest eigenvalue ( @xmath67 ) of the normalized laplacian matrix , and mean clustering coefficient ( @xmath84 ) .",

    "we then compute ppr vectors for these seed nodes using the aclcut and movcut method for different values of the truncation parameter @xmath87 and teleportation parameter @xmath88 , and we also compute the egorank vector for each of the seed nodes .",
    "recall that _",
    "smaller _ values of @xmath88 correspond to _ more local _ versions of the procedures , but that _ larger _ values of @xmath87 correspond to _ more local _ versions of the procedures .",
    "the aclcut and movcut methods give very similar results for most of the 50 seed nodes in our sample , although ( as discussed below ) some seed nodes do yield noticeable differences .",
    "the two methods give the most similar results for fb - johns55 ( mean : 0.92 , minimum : 0.43 ) , whereas we find larger deviations in both ca - grqc ( mean : 0.85 , minimum : @xmath89 ) and us - senate ( mean : 0.86 , minimum : @xmath90 ) .",
    "note that we calculated the mean , maximum , and minimum over all sampled seed nodes and parameter values .",
    "interestingly , the larger deviations between the two methods for ca - grqc and us - senate occur at different values of the truncation parameter @xmath87 . for ca - grqc",
    "( and , to a lesser extent , for fb - johns55 ) , we obtain the largest deviations for smaller values ( e.g. , @xmath91 ) . for us - senate , however , we obtain the largest deviations for @xmath92 .",
    "see the bold values in tables[spearman_comp_gr][spearman_comp_senate ] .",
    "this is consistent with the very different isoperimetric properties of these three networks , as revealed by their ncps , as well as with well - known connections between conductance and random walks .",
    "there are two potential causes for the differences between the aclcut and movcut method .",
    "first , there is a truncation effect , governed by the parameter @xmath87 , in approximating the ppr vector using the aclcut method .",
    "as @xmath87 becomes smaller , the approximation in aclcut becomes more accurate and this effect diminishes .",
    "second , the two methods differ in the precise way that they use a seed vector to represent a seed node . recall that the aclcut method uses an indicator vector @xmath93 to represent a seed node @xmath16 ; thus , we use @xmath94 whenever @xmath16 is a seed node , and we set all other entries in that vector to @xmath95 .",
    "in contrast , the movcut method projects the indicator vector onto the orthogonal complement of the strength vector to ensure that @xmath96 ( see appendix[sxn : measures ] ) .",
    "this effect decreases as  @xmath97 .",
    "the larger deviations between the two methods occur for smaller values of @xmath87 in ca - grqc and fb - johns55 ; for these , the truncation effect is small , suggesting that the different way of representing a seed node is partially responsible for the difference between the results of the two methods for these networks . for larger values of @xmath87 ( in particular , @xmath98 ) , where the support of the approximate ppr vector from the aclcut method is small ,",
    "the behavior of the two methods is very similar .",
    "consequently , the differences in the choice of seed vector become more important for nodes that are `` far away '' from the seed node , in the sense that they are rarely visited by the personalized pagerank dynamics that underlie these methods . as a result ,",
    "the `` local ncps '' for the two methods in figs.[fig : local_ncp_gr ] and[fig : local_ncp_johns ] are largely identical for small community sizes but diverge for large community sizes .",
    "( we use the term _ local ncp _ to refer to an ncp that we computed using only a single seed node without optimizing over the results from multiple seed choices ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for details on the construction of local ncps . )    for us - senate , the two methods behave almost identically for small @xmath87 ( see table[spearman_comp_senate ] ) , so we conclude that the different ways of representing a seed node have only a small effect on this network . however , the truncation effect is more pronounced in this network compared with ca - grqc or fb - johns55 .",
    "this feature manifests as larger deviations between aclcut and movcut in table[spearman_comp_senate ] for large @xmath87 and small @xmath88 ( i.e. , where the truncation has the strongest impact ) .",
    "the discrepancy occurs because the aclcut method initially pushes a large amount of probability to the interlayer neighbors of the seed node ( i.e. , to the same senator in different congresses ) .",
    "this probability does not diffuse to other nodes for sufficiently large values of @xmath87 .                in figs.[fig",
    ": local_gr][fig : local_senate ] , we illustrate the results from tables[spearman_comp_gr][spearman_comp_senate ] . in these figures",
    ", we plot the local ncps for ca - grqc , fb - johns55 , and us - senate for the seed nodes ( from the sample of 50 ) that yield the highest and lowest mean spearman rank correlation between the aclcut and movcut methods . in these figures , we also include visualizations of example communities that we obtained from the aclcut and movcut methods using a kamada - kawai - like spring - embedding visualization  @xcite of the @xmath31-ego - nets of these seed nodes .    from the visualizations of the local communities , it seems for ca - grqc ( see fig.[fig : local_gr ] ) and fb - johns55 ( see fig.[fig : local_johns55 ] ) that nodes included in local communities obtained from aclcut tend to be closer in geodesic distance than those obtained from movcut to the seed node .",
    "( to see this , observe that red nodes tend to be larger than light blue nodes in the visualization of the @xmath31-neighborhoods . )",
    "if this observation holds more generally and is not just an artifact of the particular communities that we show in figs.[fig : local_gr ] and[fig : local_johns55 ] , then we should obtain higher spearman rank correlations between aclcut and egonet than between movcut and egonet .",
    "indeed , tables[spearman_comp_gr][spearman_comp_senate ] consistently show this effect for all choices of @xmath87 and @xmath88 and for all three networks .",
    "note that this effect is also present in us - senate , though it is less prominent in its @xmath31-neighborhood visualization than is the case for the other two networks .",
    "figures[fig : local_gr][fig : local_senate ] also reveal that the three networks look very different from a local perspective . for fb - johns55 ( see fig.[fig : local_johns55 ] ) , both seed nodes that we considered result in reaching a large fraction of all nodes after just 2 steps .",
    "this is consistent with known properties of the full facebook graph ( circa 2012 ) of individuals connected by reciprocal `` friendships . ''",
    "for example , the mean geodesic distance between pairs of nodes of the facebook graph is very small : it was recently estimated by facebook s data team and their collaborators to be about 4.74 @xcite . additionally ,",
    "as reported by facebook s data team , one can view facebook as a collection of ego networks that have been patched together into a network whose global structure is sparse @xcite ( and such structure is an important motivation for the locally - biased notion of community structure that we advocate in this paper ) .    for ca - grqc",
    ", we obtain very different neighborhoods starting from our two different seed nodes .",
    "the node that exhibits the largest difference in behavior for both the aclcut and movcut methods appears to be better connected in the network in the sense that the @xmath31-neighborhood ( for any @xmath31 until saturation occurs ) is much larger than that of the node that showed the smallest difference .",
    "( that is , it is more in the `` core '' than in the `` periphery '' of the nested core - periphery structure of refs .",
    "we observe a similar phenomenon for fb - johns55 and us - senate .",
    "furthermore , its 1-ego - net and 2-ego - net are highly clustered , in the sense that they contain many closed triangles . for the seed node that showed the smallest difference between the aclcut and movcut methods ,",
    "we need to consider the 6-ego - net ( which has 20 nodes ) to obtain a network of similar size to the 2-ego - net for the seed node with the largest difference ( which has 15 nodes ) . in the case of the seed node in our sample that showed the least difference between the two methods , even the 6-ego - net appears rather tree - like ; it contains few closed triangles and no larger cliques .    for us - senate , the 1-neighborhood of any seed node contains only the node itself and those corresponding to the same senator in different congresses   for nodes from interlayer edges to appear in the @xmath31-neighborhood .",
    "hence , an increasing number of senators from the same congress can appear in a @xmath31-neighborhood that does not contain any nodes from interlayer edges . ] .",
    "as one begins to consider nodes that are further away , one first reaches corresponding senators in other congresses before reaching other senators with similar voting patterns from the same congress .",
    "this behavior of the egonet method contrasts with the ( pagerank - based ) aclcut and movcut methods , which tend to initially select all senators from one congress before reaching senators from other congresses .",
    "+   +   +     +     +     +    from the perspective of the locally - biased community - detection methods that we use in this paper , one can view intermediate - sized ( i.e. , meso - scale ) structures in networks as arising from collections of local features ",
    "via overlaps of local communities that one obtains algorithmically using locally - biased dynamics such as those that we consider .",
    "such local features depend not only on the network adjacency matrix but also on the dynamical process under study , the initial seed(s ) from which one is viewing a network , and the locality parameters of the method ( which corresponds to the dynamical process ) that determine how locally one is viewing the network .",
    "although a full discussion of the relationship between local structure and meso - scale structure and global structures is beyond the scope of this paper , here we provide an initial example of such results .    to try to visualize meso - scale and global network structures that we obtain from the local communities that we identify",

    "the additional normalization in our definition of association matrices is necessary to correct for the oversampling of large communities relative to small communities ( which results from sampling nodes uniformly at random ) . at first glance ,",
    "association matrices computed by sampling a modularity landscape appear to reveal much clearer community structure in these networks than what we obtain by sampling local communities .",
    "however , this is largely an artifact of the well - known resolution limit of modularity optimization  @xcite .",
    "one can mitigate this effect by using one of the multi - resolution generalizations of modularity  @xcite to sample the modularity landscape across different values of the resolution parameter .",
    "this yields association matrices that are similar in appearance to the ones that we obtain by sampling local communities .    to visualize the association matrices in a way that reveals global network structure ,",

    "instead , the small communities appear to amalgamate into a single large block ( or `` core '' ) . in fig.[fig : gr_global_vis ] , we aim to make this observation more intuitive by showing how the local communities for three different seed nodes spread through the network as we change the resolution , i.e. , the locality bias parameter .",
    "we construct the weighted network @xmath106 shown in fig.[fig : gr_global_vis ] from the unweighted ca - grqc network @xmath107 using the association matrix for the aclcut method ( fig.[fig : gr_assoc_acl ] ) .",

    "@xcite , we interpret these features shown in fig.[fig : gr_global_vis ] in terms of a nested core - periphery structure , in which the network periphery consists of relatively good communities and the core consists of relatively densely connected nodes .    for fb - johns55 ( see fig.[fig : johns55_global_vis ] as well as fig.[fig : assoc ] )",

    "note , however , from the scale of the vertical axis in figs.[ncp_acl_small ] and[ncp_mov_small ] that the community quality of these communities is very low , so one should actually construe the visualization in figs.[fig : johns55_assoc_acl ] and[fig : johns55_assoc_mov ] as highlighting a low - quality community that is only marginally better than the other low - quality communities that are present in that network . based on this visualization as well as our earlier results",
    ", the remainder of fb - johns55 does not appear to have much community structure ( at least based on using the conductance diagnostic to measure internal versus external connectivity ) .",
    "however , there do appear to be some remnants of highly overlapping communities that one could potentially identify using other methods ( e.g. , the one in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the egonet method",
    "( see fig.[fig : johns55_assoc_ego ] ) is unable to resolve not only these small communities but also the larger low - quality communities .",
    "figure[fig : johns55_global_vis ] shows how the local communities for two seed nodes that do not belong to one of the two large communities slowly spread and eventually merge ( blue and yellow nodes ) , whereas the red community ( which corresponds to the smaller of the two communities ) is quickly identified and remains separate from the other communities .    for us - senate",
    "( see fig.[fig : senate_global_vis ] as well as fig.[fig : assoc ] ) , we clearly observe the signature of temporal - based community structure at a large size scale .",
    "see figs.[fig : senate_assoc_acl ] , [ fig : senate_assoc_mov ] , and [ fig : senate_assoc_ego ] .",
    "using aclcut and movcut , we also obtain partitions at the scale of individual congresses ( see the insets in figs.[fig : senate_assoc_acl ] and[fig : senate_assoc_mov ] ) , which sometimes split into two or occasionally three individual communities .",
    "these latter partitions have been discussed previously in terms of polarization between parties  @xcite . because we fixed the temporal order of congresses for us - senate and only sort senators within the same congress",
    ", this visualization reveals communities within each senate as well as more temporally - disparate communities . in particular , for the egonet method , this ordering introduces a checkerboard pattern that correspond to temporal communities that contain senators from several congresses .",
    "figure[fig : senate_global_vis ] clearly shows that this temporal structure also dominates the behavior of local communities for individual seed nodes .    an important point from these visualizations",
    "is that , for both ca - grqc and fb - johns55 , the meso - scale and large - scale structures that result from the superposition of local communities does _ not _ correspond particularly well to intuitive good - conductance communities .",
    "relatedly , it also does _ not _ correspond particularly well to an intuitive low - dimensional structure or a nearly decomposable block - diagonal matrix of community assignments ( see our illustration in fig.[fig : stylized - hotdog ] ) , one or both of which are often assumed ( typically implicitly ) by many global methods for algorithmically detecting communities in networks  @xcite . of the networks that we investigate , only the temporal structure in us - senate ( as well as in us - house , which is a related temporally - dominant network ) closely resembles such an idealization .",
    "this is reflected clearly in its downward - sloping ncp ( see figs.[ncp_acl_small ] , [ ncp_mov_small ] , and [ fig : ncp_ego_small ] ) and in the visualizations in fig.[fig : assoc ] .    instead , in the other ( e.g. , collaboration , facebook , and many many other realistic  @xcite ) networks , community structure as a function of size is much more subtle and complicated .",
    "fortunately , our locally - biased perspective provides one means to try to resolve such intricacy . by averaging over results from different seed nodes , a local approach like",
    "ours leads naturally to the presence of strongly overlapping communities .",
    "overlapping community structure has now been studied for several years @xcite , and recent observations continue to shed new light on the ubiquity of community overlap @xcite .",
    "overlap of communities in networks is a pervasive phenomenon @xcite ; and our expectation is that most large realistic networks have communities with significant overlap , rather than merely a small amount of overlap that would amount to a small perturbation of the idealized , nearly decomposable communities in fig.[fig : stylized - hotdog ] .",
    "additionally , such overlaps imply that larger communities tend to have lower quality in terms of their internal versus external connectivity ( i.e. , in terms of how much they resemble the intuitive communities that many researchers know and love ) than smaller communities  in agreement with our empirical results on both the collaboration networks and facebook networks , but in strong disagreement with popular intuition . in these latter cases , recent work that fits related networks with upward - sloping ncps to hierarchical kronecker graphs resulted in parameters that are consistent with the core - periphery structure that we illustrated in fig.[fig : stylized - coreper ]  @xcite .",
    "synthetic benchmark networks with a known , planted community structure can be helpful for validating and gaining a better understanding of the behavior of community - detection algorithms .",
    "for such an approach to be optimally useful , it is desirable for the synthetic benchmarks to reproduce relevant features of real networks with community structure ; and it is challenging to develop good benchmarks that reproduce community structure and other structural properties of medium - sized and larger realistic networks . an extremely popular  and in some ways useful ",
    "family of benchmark networks that aims to reproduce some features of real networks are the so - called _ lfr ( lancichinetti - fortunato - radicchi ) networks _ @xcite . by design ,",
    "lfr networks have power - law degree distributions as well as power - law community - size distributions , they are unweighted , and they have non - overlapping planted communities . motivated by our empirical results on networks constructed from real data , we also apply our methods to lfr networks to test the extent to which they are able to reproduce the three classes of ncp behavior ( upward - sloping , flat , and downward - sloping ) that we have observed with real networks .    to parametrize the family of lfr networks , we specify its power - law degree distribution using its exponent @xmath112 , mean degree @xmath113 , and maximum degree @xmath114 . similarly , we specify its power - law community size distribution using its exponent @xmath115 , minimum community size @xmath116 , and maximum community size @xmath117 , with the additional constraint that the sum of community sizes should equal the size of the network @xmath101 . furthermore , we specify the strength of community memberships using a mixing parameter @xmath118 , where each node shares a fraction @xmath119 of its edges with nodes in its own community .",
    "a simple calculation shows that this definition of the mixing parameter implies that each community in the planted partition has conductance @xmath118 ( up to rounding effects ) .    to construct a network with these parameters",
    ", we sample @xmath101 degrees from the degree distribution and sample community sizes from the community size distribution .",
    "we then assign nodes to communities uniformly at random , with the constraint that a node can not be assigned to a community that is too small for the node to have the correct mixing - parameter value .",
    "we then construct inter - community and intra - community edges separately by connecting the corresponding stubs ( i.e. , ends of edges ) uniformly at random .",
    "we use the implementation by lancichinetti  @xcite to generate lfr networks .    in fig.[fig :",
    "benchmarks ] , we show representative ncps for lfr networks for three choices of parameters for the degree distribution and community - size distribution that have been used previously to benchmark community - detection algorithms  @xcite .",
    "( we generated the results presented in fig.[fig : benchmarks ] using the aclcut method , but we obtain nearly identical ncps using the movcut method . )",
    "the three subfigures demonstrate that all three parameter choices yield networks with similar ncps .",
    "in particular , we observe that  above a certain critical size ",
    "the best communities have comparable quality , as a function of increasing size .",
    "depending on the particular parameter values , this can be of similar quality to or somewhat better than that which would be obtained by , e.g. , a vanilla ( not extremely sparse ) er random graph , across all larger size scales .",
    "that is , above the critical size , the ncp is approximately flat . increasing the topological mixing parameter @xmath118 in the lfr network generative mechanism at first shifts the entire ncp upwards because the number of inter - community edges increases . for @xmath120 , it levels off to the characteristic flat shape for an ncp of a network generated from the configuration model of random  graphs .",
    "importantly , the behavior for the lfr benchmark networks from ref .",
    "@xcite that we illustrate in fig.[fig : benchmarks ] does _ not _ resemble the ncps for any of the real - world networks in either the present paper or in ref .",
    "in addition , we have been unable to find parameter values for which the qualitative properties of realistic ncps  in particular , a relatively gradually upward - sloping ncp  are reproduced , which suggests that the community structure generated by the lfr benchmarks is _ not _ realistic in terms of its size - resolved properties .    to verify that this behavior is not an artifact of the particular choices of parameters shown in fig.[fig : benchmarks ] , we sampled sets of parameters uniformly at random with @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 .",
    "the aggregate trends of the ncps for the lfr benchmark networks with the different parameters we sample are similar to and consistent with the results shown in fig.[fig : benchmarks ] .",
    "hence , although the lfr benchmark networks are useful as tests for community - detection techniques , our calculations suggest that they are unable to reproduce a fundamental feature of many real networks with respect to variation in community quality ( and , in particular , worsening community quality ) as a function of increasing community  size .",
    "based on our empirical observations , our locally - biased perspective on community detection suggests a natural approach to determine whether synthetic benchmarks possess small - scale , medium - scale , and large - scale community structure that resembles that of large realistic networks : namely , a family of synthetic benchmark networks ought to include parameter values that generate networks with ( robust ) upward - sloping , flat , and downward - sloping ncps ( as observed in figs.[fig : ncp - possiblencps ] and[ncp_acl_small ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we have conducted a thorough investigation of community quality as a function of community size in a suite of realistic networks , and we have reached several conclusions with important implications for the investigation of realistic medium - sized to large - scale networks .",
    "our results build on previous work on using network community profiles ( ncps ) to study large - scale networks  @xcite . in this paper , we have employed a wider class of community - identification procedures , and we have discovered a wider class of community - like behaviors ( as a function of community size ) in realistic networks than what had been reported previously in the literature  .",
    "in addition , using ncps , we have discovered that the popular lfr synthetic benchmark networks , which are often used to validate community - detection algorithms  and which are the most realistic synthetic benchmark networks that have been produced to test methods for community detection @xcite  exhibit behavior that is markedly different from many realistic networks .",
    "our result thus underscores the importance of developing realistic benchmark graphs whose ncps are qualitatively similar to those of real networks . taken together ,",
    "our empirical results yield a much better understanding of realistic community structure in large realistic networks than was previously available , and they provide promising directions for future work .",
    "more generally , because our approach for comparing community structures in networks ( using ncps and conductance ratio profiles ) is very general  e.g .",
    ", one can follow an analogous procedure with other community - quality diagnostics , other procedures for community generation , etc.our locally - biased and size - resolved methodology is an effective way to investigate size - resolved meso - scale network structures much more generally .",
    "the main conclusion of our work is that community structure in real networks is much more intricate than what is suggested by the block - diagonal assumption that is ( either implicitly or explicitly ) made by most community - detection methods ( including ones that allow overlapping communities @xcite ) and when using the synthetic benchmark networks that have been developed to test those methods .",
    "community structure interplays with other meso - scale features , such as core - periphery structure @xcite , and investigating only community structure without consideration of other structures can lead to misleading results . a local perspective on community detection , like the one that we have advocated in the present paper , allows pervasive community overlap in a natural way  which is an important feature to capture when considering real social networks .",
    "additionally , the large - scale consensus community structure that we obtain subsequently by `` pasting together '' local communities is not constrained to resemble a global block - diagonal structure .",
    "this is a key consideration in the study of meso - scale structures in real networks .",
    "although most algorithmic methods for community detection take a different approach from ours , the observation that network community structure depends not only on the network structure per se but also on the dynamical processes that take place on a network and the initial conditions ( i.e. , seed node or nodes ) for those processes , is rather traditional in many ways",
    ". recall , for example , granovetter s observation that a node with many weak ties is ideally suited to initialize a successful social contagion process  @xcite .",
    "our perspective also meshes better than global ones with real - life experience in our own networks .",
    "both of these observations underscore our point that whether particular network structures form bottlenecks for a dynamical process depends not only on the process itself but also on the initial conditions of that  process .",
    "more generally , one might hope that our size - resolved and locally - biased perspective on community detection can be used to help develop new diagnostics that complement widely - used and intuitive concepts such as closeness centrality , betweenness centrality , and the many other existing global notions .",
    "these will be of particular interest for investigating large networks  or even modestly - sized networks such as those that we have considered  where traditional algorithmic and visualization methods have serious difficulties . because the study of meso - scale structure in networks is important for understanding how local and small - scale properties of a network interact with global or large - scale properties",
    ", we expect that taking a locally - biased perspective on community detection and related problems will yield interesting and novel insights on these and related questions .",
    "in this section , we provide a brief introduction to the concept of an _ expander graph _ ( or , more simply , an _ expander _ ) @xcite .",
    "essentially , expanders are graphs that are very well - connected and thus do not have any good communities ( when measured with respect to diagnostics such as conductance ) . because our empirical results indicate that many large social and information networks are expanders  at least when viewed at large size - scales  it is useful to review basic properties about expander graphs . although most of the technical aspects of expander graphs are beyond the scope of this paper , ref .",
    "@xcite provides an excellent overview of this topic .",
    "let @xmath107 be a graph , which we assume for simplicity is undirected and unweighted .",
    "for the moment , we assume that all nodes have the same degree @xmath127 ( i.e. , @xmath9 is @xmath127-regular ) . for @xmath128 , the set of edges from @xmath56 to @xmath57 is then @xmath129 in this case , the number @xmath130 of nodes in @xmath33 is a natural measure of the size of @xmath33 .",
    "additionally , the quantity @xmath131 , which indicates the number of edges that cross between @xmath33 and @xmath63 , is a natural measure of the size of the boundary between @xmath33 and @xmath63 .",
    "we also define the _ edge expansion of a set of nodes @xmath60 _ as @xmath132 in which case the _ edge expansion of a graph @xmath9 _ is the minimum edge expansion of any subset ( of size no greater than @xmath133 ) of nodes : @xmath134 a sequence of @xmath127-regular graphs @xmath135 is a _ family of expander graphs _ if there exists an @xmath136 such that @xmath137 for all @xmath138 .",
    "informally , a given graph @xmath9 is an expander if its edge expansion is large .    as reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can view expanders from several complementary viewpoints . from a combinatorial perspective , expanders are graphs that are highly connected in the sense that one has to sever many edges to disconnect a large part of an expander graph . from a geometric perspective , this disconnection difficulty implies that every set of nodes has a relatively very large boundary . from a probabilistic perspective , expanders are graphs for which the natural random - walk process converges to its limiting distribution as rapidly as possible . finally , from an algebraic perspective , expanders are graphs in which the first nontrivial eigenvalue of the laplacian operator is bounded away from @xmath95 .",
    "( because we are talking here about @xmath127-regular graphs , note that this statement holds for both the combinatorial laplacian and the normalized laplacian . )",
    "in addition , constant - degree ( i.e. , @xmath127-regular , for some fixed value of @xmath127 ) expanders are the metric spaces that ( in a very precise and strong sense  @xcite ) embed least well in low - dimensional spaces ( such as those discussed informally in section[sxn : prelim - looklike ] ) .",
    "all of these interpretations imply that smaller values of expansion correspond more closely to the intuitive notion of better communities ( whereas larger values of expansion correspond , by definition , to better expanders . )    note the similarities between eq . and",
    "eq . , which define expansion , with eq . and eq . , which define conductance .",
    "these equations make it clear that the difference between expansion and conductance simply amounts to a different notion of the size ( or volume ) of sets of nodes and the size of the boundary ( or surface area ) between a set of nodes and its complement .",
    "this difference is inconsequential for @xmath127-regular graphs .",
    "however , because of the deep connections between expansion and rapidly - mixing random walks , the latter notion ( i.e. , conductance ) is much more natural for graphs with substantial degree heterogeneity .",
    "the interpretation of failing to embed well in low - dimensional spaces ( like lines or planes ) is not as extremal in the case of conductance and degree - heterogeneous graphs as it is in the case of expansion and degree - homogeneous graphs ; but the interpretations of being well - connected , failing to provide bottlenecks to random walks , etc .",
    "all hold for conductance and degree - heterogeneous graphs such as those that we consider in the main text of the present paper . accordingly",
    ", it is insightful to interpret our empirical results on small - scale versus large - scale structures in networks should be in light of known facts about expanders and expander - like graphs .",
    "in this section , we describe in more detail how we algorithmically identify possible communities in graphs . because we are interested in local properties and how they relate to meso - scale and global properties , we take an operational approach and view communities as the output of various dynamical processes ( e.g. , diffusions or geodesic hops ) , and we discuss the relationship between the output of those procedures to well - defined optimization problems .",
    "the idea of using dynamics on a network has been exploited successfully by many methods for finding `` traditional '' communities ( of densely connected nodes )  @xcite as well as for finding sets of nodes that are related to each other in other ways  @xcite .    in this paper",

    "the movcut method provides an alternative way of sampling local community profiles to construct an ncp .",
    "unlike aclcut , which uses _ only _ local information to obtain good communities , movcut also incorporates some global information about a network to construct local communities around a seed node .",
    "in particular , this implies that there can be sweep sets and thus communities that consist of disconnected components of a network .",
    "such communities have infinitely large conductance ratios .",
    "we observe this phenomenon often for the coauthorship and facebook networks , but it almost never occurs for the congressional voting networks . upon examination , these sweep sets consist of several small sets of peripheral nodes , each of which has moderate to very low conductance , but which are otherwise unrelated .",
    "although one would not usually think of such a set of nodes as a single good community , optimization - based algorithms often clump several unrelated communities into a single community for networks with a global core - periphery structure . for completeness and comparison ,",
    "we include our results both when we keep the disconnected sweep sets and when we restrict our attention to connected communities .",
    "as we discuss below , the ncp does not change substantially , although there are some small differences .",

    "the crp plots are also very similar ( compare figs.[condratio_mov_small ] and[condratio_mov_large ] to figs.[condratio_acl_small ] and[condratio_acl_large ] ) . for the coauthorship networks ( ca - grqc and ca - astroph )",
    ", as well as fb - harvard1 , both movcut and aclcut identify the same good small communities that are responsible for the spikes in the ncp plots .",
    "in addition , the communities that yield the dips in the ncps for fb - johns55 near 220 and 1100 nodes , and for fb - harvard1 near 1500 nodes , all share more than 98% of their nodes .",
    "this indicates that both methods are able to find roughly the same community - like structures .",
    "however , the results from the movcut ncp for ca - grqc is higher and less choppy than the one that we computed using aclcut  because the truncation employed by aclcut performs a form of implicit sparsity - based regularization that is absent from movcut .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for a discussion and precise characterization of this regularization . for the coauthorship and facebook networks",
    ", we also note that there are regions of the computed ncps , when using the movcut method , in which one finds disconnected sweep sets ( see the thin curves ) with lower conductance than that for the best connected sets of the same size . at other sizes ,",
    "we see some differences between the ncps from movcut and aclcut .",
    "this illustrates that the two methods can have somewhat different local behavior , although both methods produce similar insights regarding the large - scale structure in these networks . in section[sxn : local - comp ] , we discuss some of these differences between our results from the two methods in more detail .",
    "the egonet method was not originally developed to optimize conductance , although there is some recent evidence that @xmath31-neighborhoods can be good conductance communities @xcite .",
    "the assumption that underlies the egonet method is that nodes in the same community should be connected by short paths .",
    "however , unlike the spectral - based methods ( aclcut and movcut ) , the egonet method does not take into account the number of paths between nodes .",
    "in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , which considered only @xmath42-neighborhoods , here we also examine @xmath31-neighborhoods with @xmath173 . we can then use this method to sample a complete ncp for a network .    despite its simplicity , and in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , the egonet method produces ncp s that are qualitatively similar to those from both the aclcut and movcut methods , for all of the networks that we considered ; see figs.[fig : ncp - ego - small ] and[fig : ncp - ego - large ] .",
    "the ncps for the egonet method are shifted upwards compared to those for the aclcut and movcut methods ; and this is particularly noticeable at larger community size .",
    "this is unsurprising , because the latter two methods more aggressively optimize the conductance objective .",
    "however , for all six of our networks , this method preserves an ncp s small - scale structure as well as the global tendency to be upward - sloping , flat , or downward - sloping .",
    "this provides further evidence that the qualitative features of an ncp provide a signature of community structure in a network and are not just an artifact of a particular way to sample communities . in section[sxn : local - comp ] , we give a more detailed comparison between the results of these methods .",

    "<S> it is common in the study of networks to investigate intermediate - sized ( or `` meso - scale '' ) features to try to gain an understanding of network structure and function . </S>",
    "<S> for example , numerous algorithms have been developed to try to identify `` communities , '' which are typically construed as sets of nodes with denser connections internally than with the remainder of a network . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we adopt a complementary perspective that `` communities '' are associated with bottlenecks of locally - biased dynamical processes that begin at seed sets of nodes , and we employ several different community - identification procedures ( using diffusion - based and geodesic - based dynamics ) to investigate community quality as a function of community size . using several empirical and synthetic networks , </S>",
    "<S> we identify several distinct scenarios for `` size - resolved community structure '' that can arise in real ( and realistic ) networks : ( i ) the best small groups of nodes can be better than the best large groups ( for a given formulation of the idea of a good community ) ; ( ii ) the best small groups can have a quality that is comparable to the best medium - sized and large groups ; and ( iii ) the best small groups of nodes can be worse than the best large groups . as we discuss in detail , which of these three cases holds for a given network can make an enormous difference when investigating and making claims about network community structure , and it is important to take this into account to obtain reliable downstream conclusions . depending on which scenario holds , one may or may not be able to successfully identify `` good '' communities in a given network ( and good communities might not even exist for a given community quality measure ) , the manner in which different small communities fit together to form meso - scale network structures can be very different , and processes such as viral propagation and information diffusion can exhibit very different dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our results suggest that , for many large realistic networks , the output of locally - biased methods that focus on communities that are centered around a given seed node might have better conceptual grounding and greater practical utility than the output of global community - detection methods . </S>",
    "<S> they also illustrate subtler structural properties that are important to consider in the development of better benchmark networks to test methods for community detection . </S>"
