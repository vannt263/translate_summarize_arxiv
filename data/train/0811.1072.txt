    "the lunar cherenkov ( lc ) technique , in which radio - telescopes search for pulses of microwave - radio radiation produced via the askaryan effect @xcite from uhe particle interactions in the lunar regolith , is a promising method for detecting the highest energy cosmic rays ( cr ) and neutrinos .",
    "proposed by dagkesamanskii and zheleznykh  @xcite and first attempted by hankins , ekers & osullivan  @xcite using the parkes radio telescope , subsequent experiments at goldstone ( glue ) @xcite , kalyazin @xcite , and westerbork @xcite have placed limits on an isotropic flux of uhe neutrinos .    the square kilometre array ( ska ; @xcite ) , a giant radio array of total collecting area @xmath0 km@xmath1 to be completed by @xmath22020 , will offer unprecedented sensitivity , and have the potential to observe both a cosmogenic neutrino flux from gzk interactions of uhe cr and the uhe cr themselves @xcite .",
    "one aim of the lunaska project ( lunar uhe neutrino astrophysics with the ska ) is to develop experimental methods scalable to giant , broad - bandwidth radio arrays such as the ska . for this purpose",
    ", we have been using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , a radio interferometer of six @xmath3-m dishes along a @xmath4  km e - w baseline located in new south wales , australia .",
    "here we report on our techniques , which have allowed us to achieve a lower detection threshold than other lc experiments , and have the greatest exposure to @xmath5  ev neutrinos coming from the vicinity of centaurus a and the galactic centre over all detection experiments .",
    "we have implemented the hardware described below on three of the six atca antennas , ca01 , ca03 , and ca05 , with a maximum baseline of @xmath6  m. in each , we installed specialised pulse de - dispersion and detection hardware , with the full signal path at each antenna shown in fig .",
    "[ block_diagram ] .",
    "we have been utilising an fpga - based back - end , the `` cabb digitiser board '' , installed as part of the on - going compact array broadband upgrade , which allows us to process the full @xmath7  mhz ( @xmath8-@xmath9  ghz ) bandwidth provided by the standard atca l - band signal path .",
    "this is split into dual linear polarisations , passed through an analogue de - dispersion filter to correct for the effects of the earth s ionosphere , and then @xmath10-bit - sampled at @xmath11-ghz .",
    "a simple threshold trigger algorithm is then applied which sends back a @xmath12  sample ( @xmath13  ns ) buffer of both polarisations to the control room  along with antenna - specific clock times accurate to @xmath14  ns  should the voltage on either polarisation exceed an adjustable threshold .        to coherently dedisperse our full @xmath7  mhz bandwidth and",
    "recover our full sensitivity , we have made use of innovative new analogue dedispersion filters .",
    "the filters consist of @xmath0  m of tapered microwave waveguide wrapped for easy of storage into a spiral pattern , with the continuous sum of reflections along their length producing a frequency - dependent delay varying contrary to ( and thus correcting for ) the delay induced by the earth s ionosphere .",
    "while the filters can only correct for a fixed delay , the ionosphere over the antenna during night - time hours ( at least near solar cycle minimum ) is relatively stable , producing a typical @xmath15  ns of dispersion across our bandwidth at zenith .",
    "therefore we set the filters to correct for @xmath16  ns of dispersion , i.e.  the expected value when the moon is at @xmath17 elevation .    for the observations reported here",
    ", the full continuous bandwidth could not be returned to a central location for coincident triggering , though this will not be the case for future observations .",
    "hence our use of only three antennas  until we combine information from all antennas in real - time , we are limited by the sensitivity of each , which we can only partially recover with by increasing our trigger rate .",
    "we currently set the thresholds so that each polarisation channel would be triggering at @xmath18  hz of a maximum @xmath19  hz , for an effective dead - time on a three - fold trigger of approximately @xmath4% .",
    "a summary of our observation runs is given in tbl .",
    "[ obstbl ] , covering a trial period in may 2007 , and our main observing runs in february and may 2008 .",
    "the 2007 and february 2008 runs were tailored to ` target ' a broad ( @xmath20 ) region of the sky near the galactic centre , harbouring the closest supermassive black hole and potential accelerator of uhe cr .",
    "therefore for these runs we pointed the antenna towards the lunar centre , since this mode maximises coverage of the lunar limb ( from which we expect to see the majority of pulses ) and hence we achieve the greatest total effective aperture .",
    "our may 2008 observing period targeted centaurus a only , a nearby active galaxy which could potentially account for two of the uhe cr events observed by the pierre auger observatory @xcite .",
    "regardless of their source , this suggests the likelihood of an accompanying excess of uhe neutrinos , and we do not exclude the possibility of seeing the uhe cr themselves .",
    "we therefore pointed the antenna at that part of the lunar limb closest to cen a in order to maximise sensitivity to uhe particles from this region @xcite .",
    ".observation dates ( nights thereof ) and total time @xmath21 spent observing the moon in detection mode of our observing runs . [",

    "our lunaska lunar observations are continuously improving , both as new hardware becomes available , and as we become more experienced at observing in a ns radio environment .",
    "we have already achieved the greatest sensitivity for a lunar cherenkov experiment , and accumulated the greatest exposure to uhe neutrinos in the @xmath22  ev range from the vicinity of sgr a * and cen a. we have also demonstrated that an array of antennas observing over a broad bandwidth is extremely efficient for disciminating between terrestrial rfi and true lunar pulses .",
    "the next stage is to implement real - time coincidence logic between antennas and improve the rfi filtering , so we expect our @xmath23 observations  for which time has been allocated  to be the most sensitive yet .",
    "this research was supported by the australian research council s discovery project funding scheme ( project numbers dp0559991 and dp0881006 ) .",
