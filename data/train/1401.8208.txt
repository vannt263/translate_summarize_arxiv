    "outcomes of the study are :    * considering @xmath170 in the first modified field equation of bd theory leads to a linear differential equation which could be solved analytically to have a solution for the reconstructed hubble parameter in terms of scale factor @xmath73 ; when plotted against redshift @xmath91 , it exhibited decaying pattern with the evolution of the universe ( i.e. , decreases in @xmath84 ) and this is consistent with the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "* the nhde energy density , as reconstructed through hubble parameter , when plotted against @xmath84 , is found to increase with evolution of the universe and it is consistent with the evolution of the universe from matter to dark energy domination .",
    "* violation of strong energy condition , as expected in the framework of einstein gravity , has also been found for the reconstructed nhde model in the framework of bd gravity . *",
    "the reconstructed equation of state ( eos ) parameter has been found to exhibit  phantom \"- like behavior , i.e. @xmath171 . * considering three different combinations of the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 , namely @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 and setting the other parameters as @xmath88 and the bd parameter @xmath31 following @xcite , we have computed the reconstructed eos parameter for the reconstructed nhde .",

    "( [ eos ] ) we found that the results are in good agreement with observations of @xcite ( see table i ) .    in the following phase of the study , we considered the correspondence between the reconstructed new holographic dark energy in the framework of bd gravity and some scalar field dark energy models in a manner under which the two scenarios can be simultaneously valid .",
    "this type of approach is available in cosmological literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we have constructed the potentials and the scalar fields of these models .",
    "we observed that @xmath172 for all of the reconstructed scalar field models upt o @xmath165 and , at very late stage , ( i.e. , @xmath173 ) , we have @xmath174 . moreover , @xmath175 for all of the models .",
    "in summary , by generalizing the previous works @xcite to the nhde model with @xmath0 in the framework of chameleon brans - dicke cosmology , we have obtained the evolution of eos . following @xcite we have considered @xmath63 , @xmath27 and @xmath64 in power - law form and accordingly reconstructed hubble parameter .",
    "this approach differs from @xcite in the sense that instead of considering brans - dicke cosmology , we have considered chameleon brans - dicke with coupling function @xmath64 . we have tested sec and wec conditions and interpreted evolution of eos from them . with some choice of the model parameters we computed eos and found the the computed values of eos are consistent with the observational results coming from sneia data that suggest a limit of the eos parameter as @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "subsequently we examined the stability for the obtained solutions of the crossing of the phantom divide under a quantum correction of massless conformally - invariant fields and we have seen that quantum correction could be small when the phantom crossing occurs and the obtained solutions of the phantom crossing could be stable under the quantum correction . in the subsequent phase ,",
    "we have established a correspondence between the nhde model and the quintessence , the dbi - essence and the tachyon scalar field models in the framework of chameleon brans - dicke cosmology .",
    "we reconstruct the potentials and the dynamics for these three scalar field models we have considered .",
    "the reconstructed potentials are found to increase with evolution of the universe and in a very late stage they are observed to decay .",
    "it is also observed through @xmath176 plot that the potential is increasing with @xmath64 , which indicates that the potential increases as the matter - chameleon coupling gets stronger with evolution of the universe .",

    "<S> furthermore , we have examined the stability for the obtained solutions of the crossing of the phantom divide under a quantum correction of massless conformally - invariant fields and we have seen that quantum correction could be small when the phantom crossing occurs and the obtained solutions of the phantom crossing could be stable under the quantum correction . it has also been noted that the potential increases as the matter - chameleon coupling gets stronger with the evolution of the universe . </S>"
