    "in recent years the study of affine markov processes has gained increasing interest both in the theory of stochastic processes and their applications .",
    "we continue and generalize with the present work our research on positive matrix - valued affine processes ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "much of this research has been motivated by applications in mathematical finance , where affine processes serve as realistic models for stochastic correlation of multivariate asset models as well as for economic risk factors with a non - trivial dependence structure . for an account of relevant applications of matrix - valued affine processes",
    "we refer to  @xcite .",
    "a natural generalization of positive semidefinite matrices are the so - called symmetric cones ( see the standard reference  @xcite ) .",
    "this framework covers many important examples , such as the cone @xmath0 , the cone of hermitian matrices and the lorentz cone @xmath1 , defined by @xmath2 .",
    "affine diffusion processes on this kind of state spaces were first considered by  @xcite in the context of affine term structure models . in this article , we take up the setting of symmetric cones and provide a full characterization of affine processes thereon .",
    "other state spaces , such as sets whose boundary is described by a quadratic polynomial , have been considered by  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the condition of a quadratic boundary structure implies that the state space is either parabolic ( see also  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 12 ) ) or isomorph to the symmetric lorentz cone .",
    "let us remark that the boundary of other symmetric cones is in general described by polynomials of higher degree .",
    "only a few articles have considered affine processes on completely general state spaces , such as  @xcite and  @xcite , where regularity , that is the time - differentiability of their fourier - laplace transform , and path properties of affine processes are considered . for an analysis of affine processes ( under the regularity condition ) on relatively general state spaces we refer to the thesis of  @xcite .    in the present article",
    "the results of  @xcite are extended or reformulated or simplified as follows :    * regularity , the feller property and necessary admissibility conditions are proved for affine processes on proper closed convex cones . * sufficient admissibility conditions , in other words the full characterization of affine processes , are derived for symmetric cones . *",
    "it is shown for the first time that there exist affine diffusion processes on cones which are neither polyhedral nor symmetric .",
    "* non - central wishart distributions on symmetric cones are analyzed , described and embedded into affine processes , extending considerably the knowledge on those distributions .",
    "* we manage to simplify the theory of affine processes by taking the paradigm seriously that every argument involving kolmogorov equations should be replaced by an argument involving generalized riccati equations .",
    "this last point implies in particular that essential parts are now proved differently : not only do we use the special structure of euclidean jordan algebras , but we also approach the existence issue in a new , more intrinsic and elementary way .",
    "+ indeed , the existence proof is based on the result that the solutions of the generalized riccati differential equations of a pure diffusion process with a particular drift , which we call _ bru process _ , can be recognized as cumulant generating functions of the non - central wishart distribution . in this context",
    "we also derive the explicit form of its density function ( whenever it exists ) on general symmetric cones , which has not been provided so far .",
    "furthermore , for a particular class of affine diffusion processes ( which correspond to the class of wishart processes in the case of positive semidefinite matrices ) we also establish the precise conditions under which the markov kernels admit a density .",
    "the remainder of the article is organized as follows : section  [ sec : mainresult ] contains important definitions and a summary of the main results , whose proofs are postponed to the subsequent sections . in section  [ sec : cone ] we focus on affine processes on general convex cones , while in section  [ sec : symcone ] the corresponding results are refined in the setting of symmetric cones .",
    "a construction of affine processes on symmetric cones as well as a derivation of the non - central wishart densities is done in section  [ sec : existence ] . in section  [ sec : nonboundary ] we finally establish precise conditions under which affine processes remain almost surely in the interior of a symmetric cone .",
