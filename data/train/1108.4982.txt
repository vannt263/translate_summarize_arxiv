    "the stochastic uncertainty of random disturbances regarded as a discrepancy between an inexactly known probability distribution of a real - world noise and its nominal model can significantly degrade the designed performance of a control system if the applied controller synthesis procedure relies upon a specific probability law of the disturbance and the assumption that it is known precisely .",
    "such situations can also result from the inherent variability of the conditions of the control system operational environment .",
    "so , the @xmath2 and @xmath0 controllers are efficient in full only if the basic hypotheses on the nature of external disturbances are met closely enough .",
    "it is known that the @xmath2 ( or lqg ) controller may perform poorly if the input disturbance is a strongly correlated noise  @xcite , while the @xmath0 controller designed for the deterministic worst case  @xcite demonstrates excessive conservatism if the external disturbance is white or weakly correlated random signal .",
    "one of the first ideas aimed at overcoming the lack of performance of the lqg controller in the case when the external disturbance is not the gaussian white noise arose in work  @xcite devoted to some modification of the performance criterion .",
    "this idea gave rise to development of the whole class of problems in the control theory called the risk sensitivity problems  @xcite .",
    "the ideas of deriving controller which combines the positive features of lqg ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath0 controllers ( i.e. minimizes the quadratic cost sufficiently good and is robust enough ) appeared in the beginning of 1990 s .",
    "in particular , one can distinguish an approach concerned with minimization of @xmath2 norm of the closed - loop system under constraints on its @xmath0 norm  @xcite and approach related to minimization of @xmath0 entropy functional under constraints on the closed - loop @xmath0 norm  @xcite .    as is shown in",
    ", the problem of synthesis of a controller which minimizes the @xmath0 entropy functional is equivalent in a sense to the problem of optimal risk - sensitive ( leqg ) controller synthesis .",
    "a lot of papers are devoted to the problems concerned with minimization of the @xmath0 entropy functional ( see e.g.   ) .",
    "the ideas of the mixed @xmath3 control first introduced in  @xcite were extended in  @xcite based on splitting the external disturbance into signals with bounded spectrum and bounded power and using the multi - objective @xmath3 performance criterion . a solution to the stochastic mixed @xmath3 control problem for the discrete - time systems",
    "is given in  .",
    "all of the works mentioned above exploit the techniques based on solving certain ( sometimes cross - coupled ) riccati equations . in   the mixed @xmath3 problem",
    "was considered in terms of algebraic riccati inequalities rather than equations and solved by means of convex optimization . since then the efficient interior - point algorithms for solving convex",
    "optimization problems had been developed  @xcite@xcite , convex optimization has become a standard strategy for control system analysis and synthesis .",
    "the linear matrix inequalities have proved to be a powerful formulation and design technique for a variety of linear problems  @xcite . after the @xmath0 controller synthesis problem had been solved via lmi  @xcite ,",
    "the semidefinite programming was successfully applied to developing effective solutions to multi - objective @xmath3 control problems  @xcite@xcite .",
    "a detailed survey of these extensive results is far beyond the topic of this paper and may be presented elsewhere .",
    "an approach to attenuation of uncertain stochastic disturbances based on minimax control was proposed in the middle of 1990 s  @xcite@xcite and extended later to the mimo systems and synthesis of structured controllers via lmi in  @xcite . instead of exact knowledge of the disturbance s covariance coefficients",
    ", it is only required that the covariance coefficients belong to an a priori known set .",
    "the designed controller minimizes the worst possible asymptotic output variance for all these disturbances .",
    "the considered problem is intermediate between the extreme @xmath2 and @xmath0 design scenarios and reduces to a robust control problem with uncertainty in the external disturbance signal  @xcite .    at the same time",
    ", another promising stochastic minimax alternative had emerged from ideas of i.g.vladimirov who originally developed the anisotropy - based theory of robust stochastic control presented in a series of papers  @xcite@xcite . in the view of this approach",
    ", the robustness in stochastic control is achieved by explicitly incorporating different scenarios of the noise distribution into a single performance index to be optimized ; the statistical uncertainty is measured in entropy theoretic terms , and the robust performance index can be chosen so as to quantify the worst - case disturbance attenuation capabilities of the system .",
    "the main concepts of the anisotropy - based approach to robust stochastic control are the anisotropy of a random vector and anisotropic norm of a system .",
    "the anisotropy functional introduced by i.g.vladimirov is an entropy theoretic measure of the deviation of a probability distribution in euclidean space from gaussian distributions with zero mean and scalar covariance matrices .",
    "the mean anisotropy of a stationary random sequence is defined as the anisotropy production rate per time step for long segments of the sequence . in application to random disturbances ,",
    "the mean anisotropy describes the amount of statistical uncertainty which is understood as the discrepancy between the imprecisely known actual noise distribution and the family of nominal models which consider the disturbance to be a stationary gaussian white noise sequence with a scalar covariance matrix  @xcite .",
    "another fundamental concept of i.g.vladimirovs theory is the @xmath4-anisotropic norm of a linear discrete time invariant ( ldti ) system which quantifies the disturbance attenuation capabilities by the largest ratio of the power norm of the system output to that of the input provided that the mean anisotropy of the input disturbance does not exceed a given nonnegative level @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "a generalization of the anisotropy - based robust performance analysis to finite horizon time varying systems is developed in  @xcite .    in the context of robust stochastic control design aimed at suppressing the potentially harmful effects of statistical uncertainty",
    ", the anisotropy - based approach offers an important alternative to those control design procedures that rely on a precisely known specific probability law of the disturbance and the assumption that it is known precisely .",
    "minimization of the anisotropic norm of the closed - loop system as a performance criterion leads to internally stabilizing dynamic output - feedback controllers that are less conservative than the @xmath0 controllers and more efficient for attenuating the correlated disturbances than the @xmath2 controllers  @xcite .",
    "a state - space solution to the anisotropic optimal control problem derived by i.g.vladimirov in  @xcite involves the solution of three cross - coupled algebraic riccati equations , an algebraic lyapunov equation and an equation on the determinant of a related matrix . the resulted optimal",
    "full - order estimator - based ( central ) controller is a unique one .",
    "an extension of these results to the systems with parametric uncertainties was given in  @xcite .",
    "but solving these complex systems of equations requires special developing of homotopy - like numerical algorithms  @xcite . besides",
    ", the applied equation - based synthesis procedure is not aimed at the synthesis of reduced- or fixed - order ( decentralized , structured , multi - objective ) controllers which still remains open .",
    "moreover , although the ideas of entropy - constrained induced norms and associated stochastic minimax find further development in the control literature  @xcite , the anisotropy - based theory of stochastic robust control remains largely unnoticed .",
    "one of the reasons seems to be hard numerical tractability of the analysis and synthesis problems as well as a lack of additional degrees of freedom in the controller synthesis procedure .",
    "the anisotropic suboptimal controller design is a natural extension of the approach proposed by i.g.vladimirov in  @xcite . instead of minimizing the anisotropic norm of the closed - loop system , a suboptimal controller is only required to keep it below a given threshold value . rather than resulting in a unique controller , the suboptimal synthesis yields a family of controllers , thus providing freedom to impose some additional specifications on the closed - loop system",
    "one of such specifications , for example , may be a particular pole placement to achieve desirable transient performance .",
    "getting a solution to the anisotropic suboptimal controller synthesis problem requires a state - space criterion to verify whether the anisotropic norm of a system does not exceed a given value .",
    "an anisotropic norm bounded real lemma ( anbrl ) as a stochastic counterpart of the well - known @xmath0 norm bounded real lemma for ldti systems under statistically uncertain stationary gaussian random disturbances with limited mean anisotropy was presented in  @xcite .",
    "the resulting criterion has the form of an inequality on the determinant of a matrix associated with an algebraic riccati equation which depends on a scalar parameter .",
    "a similar criterion for linear discrete time varying systems involving a time - dependent inequality and difference riccati equation is derived in  @xcite .",
    "recently , a sufficient strict version of anbrl was introduced in  @xcite in form of a convex feasibility problem employing a strict inequality in the determinant of a positive - definite matrix and a related lmi . moreover",
    ", the determinant constraint turns out to depend linearly on the squared threshold value , thus allowing to minimize it directly subject to the convex constraints and compute the @xmath4-anisotropic norm of a ldti system as a solution to the convex optimization problem  @xcite .",
    "the developed analysis procedure is numerically attractive and easily realizable by means of available convex optimization software  @xcite .",
    "this paper is aimed at application of the powerful technique of convex optimization to synthesis of the anisotropic suboptimal and @xmath1-optimal controllers generally of fixed order .",
    "the anisotropic controller seems to offer a promising and flexible trade - off between @xmath2 and @xmath0 controllers . in comparison with the state - space solution to anisotropic optimal controller synthesis problem derived before in  @xcite , the proposed optimization - based approach is novel and does not require developing specific homotopy - like computational algorithms  @xcite .",
