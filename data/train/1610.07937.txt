    "if two high energy protons collide , many new particles ( mostly pions ) are produced , but sometimes they scatter elastically and retain their entity .",
    "it is surprising enough that at very high collision energies the proportion of elastic processes increases with increasing energy from the isr to the lhc .",
    "this unexpected and paradoxical phenomenon and its consequences at present and higher energies are discussed in the review .",
    "one gets often accustomed to unexpected facts and they become just either the everyday reality or the trivial observation .",
    "however sometimes they stay unexplained for a long time .    in the 50-th",
    ", the strong interactions of hadrons impressed the physics community by production of resonances in the pion - proton collisions .",
    "afterwards , the resonances filled in all the tables of elementary particles and became the well known phenomenon .",
    "this process lasts up to now with the discovery of the famous higgs - boson or by the `` closure '' of the massive two - photon resonance .",
    "the phemnomenon is described in terms of the dynamical levels of the system .",
    "however not all the discoveries have the required interpretation . in the beginning of the 70-th",
    ", it was unexpectedly found that the total cross section of the interaction of positively charged kaons with protons became increasing with the energy increase already at energies of the protvino accelerator up to 70 gev in the rest ( laboratory ) system of one of the protons or about 12 gev in the center - of - mass system .",
    "let us remind that up to that time it was commonly believed that hadronic cross sections must either decrease or tend to constant values with energy increase .",
    "this belief was first strongly shuttered by the so - called `` serpukhov effect '' .",
    "nowadays it is well known that the total cross section of interaction of high energy protons steadily increases with the increase of energy of colliding partners .",
    "the elastic scattering cross section as well as the cross section of inelastic processes increase with energy also .",
    "both the larger intensity of the interaction due to the larger number of the actively participating partons ( mostly , gluons ) and its larger spatial extention can be in charge of that behaviour .",
    "moreover , it happens that all hadronic cross sections increase with energy .",
    "almost half a century has passed since then but no fundamental explanation of such behaviour in the quantum field theory has been proposed .",
    "phenomenologically , it is usually described nowadays by the power - law energy dependence due to exchange by the so - called supercritical pomeron .",
    "its dynamical origin is yet unclear .",
    "it is less known that experimental data hide another quite surprising and completely unexpected phenomenon of increase of the ratio of elastic to inelastic ( or total ) cross sections with energy increase in the interval from isr ( 20 - 60 gev in the center - of - mass system ) @xcite to the highest explored accelerator energies at lhc ( 7 - 13 tev ) @xcite .",
    "the share of elastic collisions in the total outcome of all processes used to decrease at lower energies that coincided with our expectations .",
    "however , it reversed the tendency at isr ( the corresponding data were analyzed by me and the table with them was demonstrated earlier in physics - uspekhi journal @xcite ) .",
    "their relative roles evolve drastically .",
    "the inelastic cross section is about 5 times larger than the elastic one at isr while their ratio decreases to 3 at lhc energies . according to the intuitive classical ideas",
    "we would expect the opposite behaviour with increasing probability of the break - down of both colliding protons into more and more `` pionic pieces '' compared to their survival probability , when protons are scattered purely elastically .",
    "moreover , this increasing proportion of elastic scattering approaches such critical value at lhc energies @xcite which , probably , indicates the transition to some principally new regime of interactions . somehow the protons tend to keep their entity while colliding with higher and higher energies . no reliable explanation to this fact exists as well ! some simplest proposals are considered only .    here , we show the consequences of such an increase at present energies in the picturesque presentation of the spatial interaction regions of colliding protons .",
    "we describe their possible non - trivial evolution at higher energies if this tendency persists .",
    "the adopted approach relies only on the unitarity condition and experimental data about elastic scattering of protons .",
    "no phenomenological input has been used .",
    "that assures the validity of conclusions .",
    "the results of some phenomenological models are discussed just to provide additional support to our statements .",
    "the general indubitable principle of conservation of total probability known in particle physics as the unitarity condition relates elastic and inelastic processes .",
    "sum of their ratios to total outcome should be equal 1 .",
    "therefrom , some knowledge about inelastic processes can also be gained using the elastic scattering data .",
    "the latter ones depend on smaller number of variables .",
    "thus they can be analyzed more easily .",
    "surely , from another side , that leads to the somewhat restricted sample of conclusions about inelastic processes which one gets from the unitarity condition .",
    "nevertheless , one gains some knowledge about the spatial interaction region of protons at present energies and its possible evolution at higher energies .    from the heuristic point of view",
    ", the increase of the share of elastic scattering to the critical value attained at lhc can for the first time reveal the transition from the traditionally considered branch of the unitarity condition dominated by inelastic processes ( where elastic scattering is treated as the shadow of inelastic collisions ) to another branch with the dominance of elastic scattering .",
    "that would require the completely new physical interpretation of the mechanism of proton ( hadron ) interactions and , probably , the formulation and further studies of new dynamical equations .",
    "the increase of the proportion of the elastic scattering processes reveals itself , first of all , in the spatial evolution of the elastic and inelastic interaction regions of colliding protons from isr to lhc energies .",
    "it happened to be instructive to learn that the inelastic interaction region becomes more black ( absorptive ) at the center , has steeper edges ( sharper decrease ) and enlarges in size due to its periphery ( the so - called bel - scenario @xcite ) with energy increase in this energy interval .",
    "even though the form of these regions can not be measured directly in experiment , this knowledge has been used , for example , for interpretation of some peculiar features of experimental data on jet production at 7 tev .",
    "also , it inspires theoretical ideas about possible experimental implications of their further evolution at higher energies .",
    "if the noticed tendency persists at higher energies , the profiles of both elastic and inelastic interactions can change drastically and show quite unexpected features , especially in the case of head - on collisions .",
    "thus the bel - scenario can be replaced by the absolutely new toroid - like regime with the enlarged role of elastic scattering for central collisions .",
    "it could be named as teh - regime ( toroidal elastic hollow ) .",
    "no explanation of this phenomenon at present energies has yet been proposed .",
    "what concerns our attempts to extrapolate it to higher energies , we hope that experimental studies of elastic scattering of polarised protons or charge asymmetries of pions produced in inelastic collisions ( or other yet unexploited observations ) could help in the proper choice of different possibilities . from the theoretical side",
    ", one can try to use more traditional qcd approach with enlarged fluctiations of gluon fields at collisions or revolutionary speculate on peculiar properties of solitons and instantons using the corresponding equations in attempts to find a reasonable explanation .",
    "let us stress once again that he approximations adopted in the considered approach are completely justified so that one can claim that all results are obtained directly from combination of the two well - grounded sources - the unitarity condition and experimental data about elastic scattering and do not require any phenomenological input and modelling .",
    "therefore the derived conclusions are very reliable .",
    "their extrapolation to ever higher energy regions relies on the only assumption that the tendency of the increase of the share of elastic scattering experimentally observed in the energy interval from isr to lhc will persist there as well .",
    "the structure of this review is as follows . in section 3",
    "we start with the description of general features of experimental results on elastic scattering of protons .",
    "then the effective theoretical tool of the unitarity condition is introduced in section 4 . there",
    "we discuss the accuracy of main approximations for elastic scattering amplitude which will be necessary for reliable estimates in the framework of the unitarity condition .",
    "it is applied further in section 5 to the special case of central head - on collisions of protons which allows to demonstrate typical features of unitarity constraints .",
    "then in section 6 the transverse spatial shapes of the inelastic and elastic interaction regions at current energies are demonstrated and their energy evolution is discussed .",
    "possible extrapolations of the profiles of interactions beyond modern ( lhc ) energies to asymptotics are presented in section 7 for different assumptions on the energy behaviour of the proportion of elastic scattering .",
    "finally , some conclusions are given at the very end of the paper .",
    "some assumptions about possible dynamical origin of the observed effect are discussed as well .",
    "the information about elastic scattering of protons comes from the measurement of the differential cross section @xmath3 at some energy @xmath4 as a function of the transferred momentum @xmath5 at its experimentally accessible values .",
    "it is related to the scattering amplitude @xmath6 in the following way @xmath7 the variables @xmath4 and @xmath8 are the squared total energy @xmath9 and the squared transferred momentum of the two colliding protons in the center - of - mass system @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the proton momentum ) and @xmath12 at the scattering angle @xmath13 . from this measurement one",
    "gets the knowledge only about the modulus of the amplitude , i.e. about the sum of the squared values of its real and imaginary parts but not about their signs .",
    "the coulomb scattering contribution to it can be neglected everywhere except small angles",
    ". however , namely there the coulomb scattering of the electrically charged protons appears to be comparable to their nuclear interaction .",
    "the interference between the nuclear and coulomb contributions to the amplitude @xmath14 becomes quite large and allows to find out from the shape of the experimental differential cross section the ratio of the real and imaginary parts of the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath15 .",

    "the differential cross section is much larger there than at larger transferred momenta .",
    "its exponential parameterization is demonstrated by the straight line at the logarithmic scale .",
    "there are several tiny features of this plot . in the very narrow region of extremely small transferred momenta the amplitude is represented by the sum of the nuclear and coulomb amplitudes .",
    "their interference produces some increase of the differential cross section in there .",
    "it has been used for estimates of the real part of the amplitude .",
    "moreover small deviations of the order of 1 per cent from the exponential shape ( invisible in fig .",
    "1 ) were noticed at the extremely precise measurements at 8 tev @xcite . also one can see the somewhat steepened shape at the very end of the diffraction cone approximated there by another exponent ( the dashed line ) which differs from the leading one albeit not very strongly and the whole effect is noticeable only in a very small interval of transferred momenta .",
    "let us note that at lower energies the shape was slightly flattened but not steepend .",
    "the impact of all these specific features on our further calculations is easily estimated .",
    "it will be shown very small bcause we will use the averaged integrated parameters .",
    "threfore in what follows we adopt the simple exponential parameterization of the diffraction cone which is precise enough for the corresponding transferred momenta and has been used by experimentalists : @xmath21 \\label{fst}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the total cross section and @xmath19 is the energy dependent slope of the diffraction cone",
    ".      some theoretical information about the energy behaviour of the real part of the forward scattering amplitude can be obtained from the dispersion relations which follow from the analyticity property of the amplitude .",
    "they relate it to the integral of the imaginary part at zero angle , i.e. to the total cross section according to the optical theorem ( see eq .",
    "( [ opt ] ) below ) . using reasonable extrapolations of the total cross section to higher energies",
    "it was predicted long ago @xcite that at high energies the real part is small compared to the imaginary part and their ratio is about 0.12 - 0.15 with slow decrease at asymptotic energies .",
    "both real and imaginary parts are positive at @xmath16 due to positivity of the latter .",
    "these predictions were confirmed by experiment . at lhc energies the measured ratios range is 0.12 - 0.145 @xcite .",
    "thus the real part only contributes about 1 - 2@xmath23 to the differential cross section ( [ dsdt ] ) at @xmath16 .",
    "what concerns the behaviour of the real part as a function of the transferred momentum , some general theoretical guesses @xcite indicated that it can become zero somewhere within the diffraction cone",
    ". therefore its decrease inside the diffraction cone should be steeper than for the imaginary part , and , consequently , its integral contribution from this region to the elastic cross section must be even smmaller .",
    "no definite position was ascribed in the papers @xcite to the point where it crosses the abscissa axis .",
    "recently , some possibilities to use the analytical properties of the elastic scattering amplitude for getting some knowledge about its real part were considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one can easily estimate from the data presented in fig . 1 and fig . 2 the upper limit of the real part of the amplitude at the dip",
    ". its ratio to the imaginary part at @xmath16 is calculated as the square root of the ratio of the differential cross sections at those points and , surely , is very small @xmath24 .",
    "this estimate supports our intention to neglect the contribution of the real part of the amplitude in further calculations where its integrally averaged characteristics are only used .    further guides about its behaviour can only be obtained from particular models of proton interactions .",
    "those of them which pretend to make precise fits of a wide variety of present experimen tal data are surely preferred .",
    "even then they should not be absolutely trusted because we have some experience that several details got wrong even at present energies and could become worse at extrapolations to new energy fields . nevertheless , as such an example , we show in fig . 3 borrowed from ref .",
    "@xcite the behaviour of the real and imaginary parts of the elastic scattering amplitude at energy 7 tev within the large interval of the transferred momenta .",
    "its shape is derived with the help of a particular phenomenological model @xcite which happened to be very successful in fits of many experimental characteristics in a wide range of energies up to lhc .",
    "in particular , one can see that the real part at 7 tev is much smaller than the imaginary part everywhere within the diffraction cone and crosses the abscissa axis in accordance with theoretical expectations @xcite .",
    "its relative contribution to the differential cross section ( [ dsdt ] ) is given by the term @xmath25 where @xmath15 .",
    "it can be neglected in the model considered .",
    "the accuracy of experimental data is not yet high enough for such small contributions to be taken into account .",
    "that corresponds well with our prejudice that the diffraction cone is somehow a shadow of inelastic processes because the elastic amplitude is substantially imaginary there .",
    "it is interesting to note that according to the model @xcite the imaginary part dominates everywhere besides the dip interval which is very short .",
    "however , the differential cross section is already very small there compared to the diffraction cone .",
    "thus in our analytical estimates we will neglect the real part of the amplitude but sometimes come back to it to show once again how irrelevant for our conclusions is its contribution .",
    "3 . real @xmath26 and imaginary @xmath27 parts of the proton - proton amplitude at 7 tev according to a particular phenomenological model @xcite .",
    "note that the contribution of the real part to @xmath3 becomes noticeable only near the dip where @xmath3 is small .",
    "it can be completely neglected inside the diffraction cone .",
    "moreover , it becomes equal zero inside it as was predicted @xcite .",
    "it is quite interesting that the imaginary part dominates in the orear region of intermediate transferred momenta as well .",
    "the steep exponential decrease of differential cross sections in the diffraction cone implies that namely this region contributes mostly to eq .",
    "( [ gamm ] .",
    "the integral contribution of the real part of the amplitude @xmath14 in there must even be noticeably smaller than its overestimated value @xmath28 .",
    "that is why it is possible to neglect it further in analytical calculations .      in what follows",
    "we will need to estimate the contribution of the region outside the diffraction peak to some analyzed variables .",
    "comparison of fig .",
    "2 with fig .",
    "1 shows that the differential cross section is much lower ( by more than 4 orders of magnitude ! ) at the dip and at the tail compared to its values at the beginning of the diffraction cone .",
    "moreover , it decreases approximately as @xmath29 in this region .",
    "it is usually called as the orear region by the name of its first observer and can be explained ( see @xcite ) by subsequent iterations ( rescattering ) in the solution of the unitarity equation in the ( @xmath30)-representation . surely , the @xmath5-exponential parameterization ( [ fst ] ) used for the diffraction cone underestimates the contribution of the tail with @xmath31-exponent at high transferred momenta .",
    "however , the integral contribution to our variables of the excess in the tail region over our approximation ( [ fst ] is easily estimated .",
    "we show below that it is negligibly small .",
    "the interplay of the real and imaginary parts of the amplitude @xmath14 can be more complicated there as seen , e.g. , from fig .",
    "however , the smallness of the modulus , i.e. , of @xmath32 , implies the smallness of both of them in this region even though their ratio @xmath33 becomes infinitely large if the imaginary part becomes equal to zero .",
    "our main goal here is to get some knowledge about the spatial region of interactions of high energy protons at current energies , to draw a pictorial view of its evolution with increasing energy and to discuss possible theoretical and experimental implications of these findings .    the most stringent and reliable information ( albeit rather limited ! ) about the interrelation of elastic and inelastic processes comes from the unitarity of the @xmath34-matrix @xmath35 or for the scattering matrix @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 denote the number of particles .",

    "this uinquestionable condition is usually expressed in the form of the well known integral relation ( for more details see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this relation is quite complicated for arbitrary values of the transferred momentum , @xmath5 .",
    "however , for forward scattering at @xmath16 it leads to the widely used optical theorem showing the normalization of the imaginary part of the amplitude @xmath44 by its direct connection with the total cross section @xmath45 : @xmath46 and to the general statement that the total cross section is the sum of cross sections of elastic and inelastic processes @xmath47",
    "i.e. , that the total probability of all processes equals 1 .    one can use the fourier ",
    "bessel transform of the amplitude @xmath14 to reduce the integral relation to the more simple algebraic one .",
    "this transformation retranslates the momentum data to the shortest transverse distance between the trajectories of the centers of colliding protons called the impact parameter , @xmath48 , and is written as @xmath49 then the unitarity condition in the @xmath48-representation reads @xmath50 ( for reviews see , e.g. , refs @xcite ) .",
    "this relation establishes the connection between the distributions of the intensity of all processes in the transverse configuration space : @xmath51 the left - hand side in eqs ( [ unit1 ] ) , ( [ elin ] ) describes the transverse impact - parameter profile of inelastic collisions of protons .",
    "it satisfies the inequalities @xmath52 and determines how absorptive is the interaction region at the given impact parameter ( with @xmath53 for the full absorption and @xmath54 for the complete dominance of elastic scattering ) .",
    "the profile of elastic processes is determined by the subtrahend in eqs ( [ unit1 ] ) , ( [ elin ] ) .",
    "thus we get a spatial view of the whole process if the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath14 is integrated in eq .",
    "( [ gamm ] ) .",
    "let us note from the very beginning that these profiles can not be measured directly in experiments because the impact parameters are not the measurable quantities . nevertheless , their energy behaviour has important heuristic value because it can reveal the evolution of the process dynamics .",
    "it will be described below how the knowledge of the spatial extension of the inelastic interaction region has been used for the description of the processes of jet production at the lhc energy 7 tev .",
    "one can use various models of the interactions and confront different assumptions .",
    "also , one can try to relate the impact parameters , for example , with the multiplicities of inelastic collisions as it is done for the interactions of the relativistic nuclei .",
    "however , we do not speculate on it in this review .",
    "if @xmath55 is integrated over the impact parameter , it leads to the cross section of inelastic processes .",
    "the terms on the right - hand side of eqs ( [ unit1 ] ) , ( [ elin ] ) would correspondingly produce the total cross section and the elastic cross section in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ telin ] ) .",
    "it follows from the above relations that , strictly speaking , one should know both real and imaginary parts of the elastic scattering amplitude to get results about the impact - parameter profiles of inelastic and elastic processes from the unitarity condition .",

    "in particular , we will use the fact that the modulus of the amplitude decreases approximately exponentially ( see eq . ( [ fst ] ) ) in the diffraction cone and becomes much smaller at the tail compared to its values at the top of the diffraction peak . the slight decline from a simple exponent inside the cone of",

    "what follows , we use the exponential parametrization of the imaginary part of the amplitude @xmath14 to proceed with analytical calculations and argue that it is very precise : @xmath56 . \\label{opt1}\\ ] ] formally , this approximation is not valid for differential cross sections at large transferred momenta .",
    "however , for our purposes the integral contribution of @xmath14 at large @xmath18 to eq .",

    "the accuracy of calculations is very high .",
    "thus one can claim that the resuts obtained analytically rely only on the unitarity condition and experimentally measured exponential decrease of the differential cross section in the diffraction cone .",
    "before using the detailed formulae for the spatial extension of the interaction region as a function of the impact parameter @xmath48 , let us study at the beginning the simpler case of the energy dependence of the intensity of interaction for central ( head - on ) collisions of impinging protons at @xmath57 .",
    "we introduce the variable @xmath58 : @xmath59 for the dominant contribution of the diffraction cone ( eq .",

    "one can get very definite conclusions about the role of different regions of the differential cross section for the variable @xmath58 and , consequently , for the unitarity condition . in practice",
    ", one should just integrate the squared root of the differential cross section over the corresponding interval of transferred momenta .",

    ". the inelastic cross section will be only about 1.5 times larger than the elastic cross section at asymptotics for these models .",
    "it is most fascinating in the presented scenarium that the density of central inelastic interactions tends to 0 for @xmath146 which would lead to the `` black disk '' limit with equal elastic and inelastic cross sections .",
    "however , no models predict such a high increase of the share of elastic scattering even at asymptotically high energies .    what concerns the inelastic processes , these models do not predict any drastic evolution of the interaction region with increasing energy over the lhc range .",
    "the ( almost ) black plateau with small dip at the central part near @xmath57 will become somewhat enlarged in size .",
    "therefore the jet cross sections due to central collisions will slightly increase as well at the beginning .",

    "in particular , one would also predict the diminished role of jet production from central collisions with further increase of @xmath58 . once again",
    ", these effects will develop very slowly , unfortunately .",
    "the intriguing purely experimental phenomenon of the increase of the share of elastic processes to the total outcome observed in proton interactions at energies from isr to lhc attracts much attention nowadays .",
    "it has not been explained yet .",
    "one of the possibilities can be related to the fact that the larger number of the high energy constituents ( quarks , gluons ) exchange by high momenta . due to the qcd property of the asymptotic freedom",
    "the role of such processes would decrease , and , correspondingly , the relative role of elastic scattering increases . let us note that the mutual influence of the smaller number of these processes and larger transferred momenta must lead to some increase of the transverse momenta of created particles as observed in experiment .",
    "another possibility is connected to the fluctuations of the partonic picture of colliding protons .",
    "the time of flight of protons through one another becomes shorter with increasing energy .",
    "the pointlike partons have almost no chance to interact during such a short time . therefore , the role of elastic processes can increase .",
    "inspite of absence of the explanation of the observed effect , the increase of the proportion of elastic processes has been used in this review paper for getting its consequences . in particular",
    ", the important information about the spatial regions of proton interactions has been obtained .",
    "the share approach to 1/4 at lhc ( or , equivalently , of @xmath58 to 1 ) can become a critical sign of the changing character of processes of hadron interactions if the above tendency of increase persists .",
    "the concave central part of the inelastic interaction region would be formed .",
    "the inelastic interaction region would then look like a toroid ( tube ) hollowed inside and strongly absorbing in its main body at the edges .",
    "the role of elastic scattering in central collision becomes increasing .",
    "that is surprising and contradicts somewhat to our everyday experience and theoretical prejudices .",
    "intuitively , we would expect the steady increase of the proportion of inelastic processes with increasing energy as it happened up to isr . instead of it",
    ", we are posed to the problem that from the formal theoretical point of view the new tendency requires now to consider another branch of the unitarity condition that asks for its physics interpretation .",
    "it is hard to believe that protons become more penetrable at higher energies after being so dark in central collisions with @xmath66 at 7 tev unless some special coherence within the internal region develops .",
    "moreover , it seems somewhat mystifying why the coherence is more significant just for central collisions but not at other impact parameters where inelastic collisions become dominant .",
    "for example , the role of the string junction in three - quark hadrons can become crucial .",
    "then this effect would not be observed , say , in the pion - proton interactions .",
    "however we have no chances to get any experimental information about these processes .",
    "moreover , the success of the quark - diquark models adds some sceptical attitude to this approach .",
    "probably , the relative strengths of the longitudinal and transverse components of gluon ( string ) fields can help to explain the new physics of teh - scenarium of the `` hollowed interactions '' of protons .    in classical terms",
    ", the transparency at central collisions could reveal itself at collisions of the two toruses with so different radii that one of them penetrates through the hole in another one at @xmath57 . in the more general situation ,",
    "those can be some stratified objects in which the empty spaces of one of them coincide at the collision with the dense regions in the another one .",
    "they overlap at peripheral collisions and therefore lead to inelastic processes",
    ". these fluctuations of the size and the structure of high energy protons seem very improbable .",
    "one could also imagine that `` black '' protons start scattering backward @xcite like the billiard balls for head - on collisions .",
    "snell s law admits such situation for equal reflective indices of colliding bodies .",
    "however the forward and backward scattering can not be distinguished for two equivalent colliding objects . that can only be checked if forward and backward scattered protons can be somehow identified in experiment",
    ". then they should wear different labels .",
    "one can use the proton spin as such a label . in principle , experiments with oppositely polarised protons can resolve the problem .",
    "unfortunately , no polarized protons are available now even at lhc .",
    "thus it is improbable that the teh - structure will be observed directly .",
    "moreover , the backward scattering would ask all partons to get coherently large transferred momenta . the asymptotic freedom of qgd claims that the probability of such processes must be extremely low .    beside the case of the two billiard balls colliding head - on , one could consider the hypothesis that centrally colliding protons at @xmath76 remind solitons which `` pass through one another without losing their identity . here",
    "we have a nonlinear physical process in which interacting localized pulses do not scatter irreversibly '' @xcite .",
    "again , in the case of two identical colliding objects it is impossible to decide whether they scatter forward or backward . in the case of solitons it is known that the non - linearity and dispersive properties ( the chromopermittivity @xcite ) of a medium compete to produce such effect",
    ". then one should understand the dynamics of the whole process . for its description one",
    "uses the equations of korteweg - de - vries and sine - gordon , the nonlinear schrodinger equation @xcite , the skyrme model @xcite , instantons @xcite .",
    "it is not at all clear yet how the qcd - nonlinearity and the properties of the quark - gluon medium could be responsible at the quantum - field level for these new features of proton interactions .",
    "again , the asymptotic freedom of qcd seems to forbid such processes .",
    "coherence of the parton structures inside the interaction region of colliding hadrons can probably lead to the observed effects .",
    "it can reveal itself in `` squeezing '' ( or complete absorption ) of the intermediate created inelastic channels .",
    "that would lead to the antishadowing effect with increasing role of the elastic channel which reminds the self - focusing of the laser beams . at the model level of reggeon interactions ,",
    "these possibilities were considered in refs @xcite with the discussion of different variants of the absorbing disk .",
    "another more exotic hypothesis @xcite which could be used to treat the hollowed internal teh - region is the formation of cooler disoriented chiral condensate inside it ( `` baked - alaska '' dcc ) .",
    "the signature of this squeezed coherent state would be some disbalance between the production of charged and neutral pions @xcite , probably , noticed in some high energy cosmic ray experiments .",
    "however the cross sections for central collisions seem to be extremely small as discussed above . the failure to find such events at fermilab",
    "is probably connected with too low energies available .",
    "it leaves some hope for higher energies in view of discussions above .",
    "total internal reflection of coherent states from dark edges of the toroid can be blamed for enlarged elastic scattering ( like transmission of laser beams in optical fibers ) .",
    "the transition to the deconfined state of quarks and gluons in the central collisions could also be claimed responsible for new effects ( see ref .",
    "the optical analogy with the scattering of light on metallic surface as induced by the presence of free electrons is used .",
    "again , it is hard to explain why that happens for central collisions while peripheral ones with impact parameters near @xmath140 are strongly inelastic .    to conclude , the problem of the increasing prportion of the elastic scattering of high energy protons , asking for its own solution , can be further studied only with the advent of experimental facilities of higher energy accelerators .",
    "cosmic ray studies do not look very promising because of the relatively low accuracy of measurements .",
    "however the detailed analyses of the extensive air showers , probably , can say something about `` escaping '' high energy protons .",
    "only very precise experimental results can lead to definite conclusions since the theoretically predicted energy dependence of the darkness of the interaction region discussed above is very mild .",
    "however the heuristic value of the foreseen results should not be underestimated .",
    "if the tendency of the increasing prportion of elastic scattering processes persists , it would pose a problem of a new view on mechanisms of proton ( hadron ) high energy interactions .",
    "then one should invent new ways of explaining the transition to quite uncommon regime of proton interactions with peculiar shapes of the interaction region .",

    "<S> experimental data on proton - proton interactions in high energy collisions show quite a special and unexpected behaviour of the proportion of elastic scattering compared to inelastic processes with increasing energy . </S>",

    "<S> energies of 23.5 - 62.5 gev up to higher energies 7 - 13 tev at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) it increases by a factor more than 1.5 ! according to intuitive classical ideas we would expect a stable tendency with increasing proportion of the break - down of protons compared to their survival probability . </S>",
    "<S> one can assume that either the asymptotic freedom or the extremely short time of flight of high energy protons through each other are in charge of such a surprising effect . </S>",
    "<S> the unquestionable principle of unitarity combined with the available experimental data on elastic scattering is used to get new conclusions about the shape of the interaction region of colliding protons . </S>",
    "<S> its evolution at present energies is considered . </S>",
    "<S> some predictions about its behaviour at even higher energies are described with different assumptions on relative roles of elastic scattering and inelastic processes . </S>",
    "<S> the shape can transform rather drastically if the proportion of elastic processes keeps rising . </S>",
    "<S> this unexpected property leads to an unexpected corollary . the possible origin of the effect and its interrelation to the strong interaction dynamics are speculated .    </S>",
