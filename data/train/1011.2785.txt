    "one of the main obstacles to the development of quantum technologies is the decoherence associated to losses and absorption processes occurring during the propagation of a quantum signal .",
    "the description of the dynamics of systems subject to noisy environments @xcite , as well the detection , quantification and estimation of losses and , more generally , the characterization of lossy channels at the quantum level , received much attention in the recent years @xcite",
    ". an efficient characterization of decoherence is relevant for quantum repeaters @xcite , quantum memories @xcite , cavity qed systems @xcite , superconducting quantum circuits @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite and secret - key capacities @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the discrimination of lossy channels , i.e. , we consider a situation where the loss ( damping ) rate of a channel may assume only two possible values and we want to discriminate between them by probing the channel with a given class of states .",
    "in particular , we address the discrimination of lossy channels for bosonic systems using squeezed thermal states as probing states , and focus attention to the case when one of the values for the loss parameter is zero , i.e. , we address the detection of a possible loss against the alternative hypothesis of an ideal lossless channel .",
    "such kind of discrimination is crucial since a recent analysis @xcite has revealed the importance of assessing the deviation from ideal conditions , i.e. , the identity channel , in implementing large - scale quantum communication .    despite the discrimination of lossy channels has been already considered in the literature , the approach of this paper is novel .",
    "previous works have in fact considered this kind of discrimination by constraining the energy irradiated over the unknown lossy channel but not the total energy employed in preparing the input states .",
    "for instance , in the quantum reading of digital memories  @xcite , the discrimination of lossy channels has been analyzed by fixing the mean total number of photons irradiated over the channel , independently on the number of probing modes ( this approach has been also followed by the recent ref .",
    "previously , in the quantum illumination of targets  @xcite , the channel discrimination was performed by fixing the mean number of photons in each of the modes probing the channel . in both these models",
    "there was no restriction for the energy involved in the use of ancillary modes .",
    "our approach considers the discrimination of lossy channels by constraining the total energy of the input state , thus including both the probing mode ( irradiated over the unknown lossy channel ) and a possible ancillary mode ( bypassing the lossy channel and detected by the output measurement ) .",
    "thus , while previous models were more focussed on restricting the energy irradiated over the channel , we address the problem from the point of view of the input source , i.e. , considering the global effort in preparing this source . by fixing the input energy , we then optimize over an important class of gaussian states , i.e. , single- and two - mode squeezed thermal states .",
    "the choice of these states relies in their experimental accessibility , being routinely generated in today s quantum optics laboratories where they can be reliably controlled @xcite .",
    "furthermore , because of the squeezing , they represent important examples of non - classical states , i.e. , states with non - positive p representation @xcite .",
    "this is another feature which diversifies our study from previous works  @xcite , where the main goal was the comparison between non - classical states and classical states ( i.e. , with positive p representation ) .",
    "note also that our problem , involving a discrete channel discrimination , is completely different from problems of parameter estimation , where one has to infer a parameter taking continuous values .",
    "the estimation of the damping constant of a bosonic channel has been recently addressed by refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is clear that , for a given input state , any problem of channel discrimination collapses into a problem of state discrimination @xcite , where we have to compute the minimum error probability in identifying one of two possible output states . by assuming @xmath0 identical copies of the input state and a memoryless quantum channel",
    ", we have @xmath0 output states which are exact replicas of two equiprobable states . in this case , the minimum error probability is well - approximated by the quantum chernoff bound ( qcb ) @xcite .",
    "now the crucial step is to vary the input state , trying to optimize the value of the output qcb . in the case of two lossy bosonic channels , this kind of optimization",
    "must be constrained , meaning that we have to fix some crucial parameters of the input states , in particular , their energy .",
    "as we have already mentioned before , in our investigation we optimize the qcb on the class of single- and two - mode squeezed thermal states by fixing their total energy .",
    "single - mode thermal states are sent through the lossy channel , while two - mode thermal states probe the channel with the one of the modes ( probing mode ) while bypassing the channel and assisting the output measurement with the other mode ( reference mode ) . in this scenario , we find that the pure version of these states , i.e. , single- and two - mode squeezed vacuum states , are optimal for detecting losses , i.e. , discriminating a lossy from a lossless channel .",
    "furthermore , we are able to show that , for any value of the damping rate smaller than a certain critical value , there is a threshold on the energy that makes the two - mode squeezed vacuum state more convenient than the corresponding single - mode state . more interestingly , for damping rates larger than the critical value , the two - mode squeezed vacuum state performs always better than the single - mode squeezed vacuum state with exactly the same energy .    in order to stay close to schemes which are feasible with current technology",
    ", we also analyze the effect of the mixedness in the probe states . in this case , we study the channel discrimination by fixing not only the total energy of the input state but also its total amount of squeezing . then , we are able to show that two - mode squeezed thermal states are always better than their single - mode counterpart when all the thermal photons are directed into the dissipative channel .",
    "we have numerically verified that this result also holds , approximately , for unbalanced distribution of the thermal photons .",
    "finally , we also investigate the role of correlations in the improvement of loss detection . in order to quantify correlations , besides entanglement and mutual information , we exploit the recent results on the quantum discord  @xcite , which has been defined with the aim of capturing quantum correlations in mixed separable states that are not quantified by entanglement .",
    "thus , at fixed input squeezing , we study the reduction of the qcb as a function of various correlation quantifiers , i.e. , quantum mutual information , entanglement and quantum discord .",
    "this analysis allows us to conclude that employing squeezing in the form of correlations , either quantum or classical , is beneficial for the task of loss detection whenever squeezed thermal states are considered as input probes .",

    "as we have mentioned before , the problem of quantum channel discrimination collapses to the problem of quantum state discrimination when we fix the input state . as a result , mathematical tools such as the quantum fidelity and the qcb are fundamental in our analysis . despite",
    "it has been introduced only very recently , the qcb has been already a crucial tool in several areas of quantum information : it has been exploited as a distinguishability measure between qubits and single - mode gaussian states @xcite , to evaluate the degree of nonclassicality for single - mode gaussian states @xcite or the polarization of a two - mode state @xcite .",
    "it has also been applied in the theory of quantum phase transitions to distinguish between different phases of the @xmath1 model at finite temperature @xcite , and to the discrimination of two ground states or two thermal states in the quantum ising model @xcite .",
    "for continuous variables systems the quantum discrimination of gaussian states is a central point in view of their experimental accessibility and their relatively simple mathematical description @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the case of gaussian states , the qcb can be computed from their first and the second statistical moments .",
    "a first formula , valid for single - mode gaussian states , was derived in @xcite .",
    "later , ref .",
    "@xcite provided a general closed formula for multimode gaussian states , relating the qcb bound to their symplectic spectra .",
    "furthermore , from these spectra one can derive larger upper bounds which are easier to compute than the qcb @xcite .    in this section ,",
    "we start by establishing notation and reviewing the problem of quantum state discrimination , together with the general definition of qcb .",
    "then , from the next section , we will specialize our attention to the case of gaussian states and we will review the formula for gaussian states in sec .  [",

    "the problem of quantum state discrimination consists in distinguishing between two possible states , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which are equiprobable for a quantum system . we suppose that @xmath0 identical copies of the quantum system are available .",
    "then , we have the following equiprobable hypotheses , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , about the global state @xmath6 in order to discriminate between these two hypotheses , one can measure the global system by using a two - outcome positive operator valued measure ( povm ) @xmath7 , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 . after observing the outcome @xmath10 or @xmath11 , the observer infers that the state of the system was @xmath12 .",
    "the error probability of inferring the state @xmath12 when the actual state is @xmath13 is thus given by the born rule @xmath14   $ ] .",

    "the computation of the trace distance may be rather difficult .",
    "for this reason , one can resort to the qcb that gives an upper bound to the probability of error @xmath19 @xcite@xmath27 where @xmath28   ~.\\label{qcbgen}%\\ ] ] the bound of eq .",
    "( [ bound : pe ] ) is attainable asymptotically in the limit @xmath29 as follows from the results in @xcite .",
    "one may think that the trace distance has a more natural operational meaning than the qcb . in spite of this",
    ", it does not adapt to the case of many copies ; indeed , one can find states @xmath30 such that @xmath31 by contrast , the qcb does resolve this problem since @xmath32 because of this property , the minimization of the qcb over single - copy states ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) implies the minimization over multi - copy states ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) .",
    "this is true as long as the minimization is unconstrained or if the constraints regard single - copy observables ( e.g. , the mean energy per copy ) .",
    "finally , note that there is a close relation between the qcb and the uhlmann fidelity@xmath37 which is one of the most popular measures of distinguishability for quantum states .",

    "note that , because of the continuity of the qcb , the error probability in the discrimination between a lossy channel ( @xmath141 ) and an almost - ideal channel ( @xmath326 ) can be made arbitrarily close to the error probability affecting the discrimination of the same lossy channel ( @xmath141 ) and an ideal channel ( @xmath140 ) .",

    "<S> we consider the discrimination of lossy bosonic channels and focus to the case when one of the values for the loss parameter is zero , i.e. , we address the detection of a possible loss against the alternative hypothesis of an ideal lossless channel . </S>",
    "<S> this discrimination is performed by inputting one - mode or two - mode squeezed thermal states with fixed total energy . by optimizing over this class of states , we find that the optimal inputs are pure , thus corresponding to single- and two - mode squeezed vacuum states . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that for any value of the damping rate smaller than a critical value there is a threshold on the energy that makes the two - mode squeezed vacuum state more convenient than the corresponding single - mode state , whereas for damping larger than this critical value two - mode squeezed vacua are always better . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider the discrimination in realistic conditions , where it is unlikely to have pure squeezing . </S>",
    "<S> thus by fixing both input energy and squeezing , we show that two - mode squeezed thermal states are always better than their single - mode counterpart when all the thermal photons are directed into the dissipative channel . </S>",
    "<S> besides , this result also holds approximately for unbalanced distribution of the thermal photons . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we also investigate the role of correlations in the improvement of detection . for fixed input squeezing ( single - mode or two - mode ) , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the reduction of the quantum chernoff bound is a monotone function of the two - mode entanglement as well as the quantum mutual information and the quantum discord . </S>",
    "<S> we thus verify that employing squeezing in the form of correlations ( quantum or classical ) is always a resource for loss detection whenever squeezed thermal states are taken as input . </S>"
