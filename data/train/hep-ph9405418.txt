    "perturbation theory is practically the only known way to compare field theory to the experiments .",
    "nonperturbative approaches , like lattice field theory , are still far from reaching the precision level of perturbation theory or of the lep experiments .",
    "the need for techniques to reliably calculate higher order radiative corrections is therefore hard to overemphasize .    in the case of qcd , two , three and even four  loop calculations were performed @xcite , but the massive case is much more difficult , and an analytical solution of the general two  loop integral does not exist .    if the particles on the external lines are light , so that one can perform an expansion around zero in the external momenta , the feynman integrals can be carried out analytically .",
    "such closed formulae made it possible for instance to calculate certain two  loop electroweak corrections to the @xmath2 parameter @xcite , to the masses of the vector bosons @xcite , and to the selfcouplings of the vector bosons @xcite .",
    "there are however physically interesting cases when such an expansion can not be performed .",
    "one obvious example is the higgs physics .",
    "knowledge of higher order quantum corrections in the higgs sector is interesting for several reasons .",
    "first , if the higgs particle is heavy , they will be numerically important and will play a rle in the higgs searches at future colliders .",
    "second , as the higgs mass increases , the higgs sector becomes strongly selfcoupled , and at some point the perturbative expansion will break down .",
    "knowledge of the higher order corrections is the only way to find out up to which point the calculations by feynman diagrams still can be trusted .",
    "third , having heavy particles on the external legs is the only way to see the details of the symmetry breaking mechanism , which are otherwise hidden by the screening theorem @xcite .",
    "considerable effort was devoted lately to the calculation of massive two ",
    "loop feynman diagrams .",
    "analytical results exist for certain ( mainly selfenergy ) diagrams evaluated at special values of the masses and of the external momenta .",
    "small and large momentum expansions were worked out , too @xcite , although the small momentum expansion is a rather trivial problem , since the propagators can be expanded in the external momenta , and closed expressions for the zero momentum case are available .",
    "for the two  loop selfenergy diagram with three propagators , an expression in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions has been found recently @xcite .",
    "these methods refer to special cases and were so far of little use to calculate physically relevant quantities .",
    "recently a numerical approach to the so  called selfenergy master diagram was proposed which reduces this diagram to a two  fold integral @xcite .",
    "it is possible to extend this method to all selfenergy diagrams @xcite .",
    "the generalization requires a special treatment of different topologies , and also numerical problems were reported in the imaginary part for certain values of the masses and momenta @xcite .",
    "one would ideally want to use one single method for any topology of two  loop diagrams .",
    "this would allow one to write computer programs to generate and compute automatically all feynman diagrams needed for a certain green s function .",
    "furthermore , one would like to push the analytical integrations as far as possible to increase the accuracy of the final result .",
    "the monte ",
    "carlo techniques allow integrations over many variables , but their accuracy is usually limited .",
    "this paper proposes a method to reduce any two  loop massive feynman diagram to a standard form involving essentially one basic function and its derivatives , by use of the feynman parameters .",
    "further , this basic function is integrated analytically as far as possible .",
    "its analyticity properties are discussed , leading to efficient methods to perform the integration over the remaining feynman parameters numerically .",
    "good agreement is found with known analytical results . as an exercise ,",
    "we calculate in the last section the selfenergy of the higgs boson to order @xmath0 , check the result by using the unitarity of the s matrix , and extract the leading corrections to the shape of the higgs resonance .",
    "in this section we provide formulae to reduce any two - loop scalar diagram with arbitrary masses and arbitrary external momenta to a standard form .",
    "this is an integral over feynman parameters of one basic function or of its derivatives .",
    "in one special case ( the two  loop integral with three propagators ) , a second function needs to be introduced .",
    "this second function appears rarely in practical calculations and can in some cases be evaluated analytically .",
    "the methods described in this section are easy to encode into an algebraic computer program like form @xcite , in order to generate and handle the large number of feynman diagrams which may be required to calculate green s functions of physical relevance .",
    "the most general form of a dimensionally regularized two  loop scalar diagram in minkowski space is :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the sum of the loop momenta , and @xmath5 are external momenta , not all of them independent .    as an obvious step ,",
