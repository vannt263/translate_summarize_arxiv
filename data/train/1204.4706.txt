    "_ demonstrated that a substantial fraction of the universe s star formation took place behind a veil of dust @xcite . because these were integrated measurements , however",
    ", they could not identify which populations of dust - obscured galaxies contained this vigorous star formation . a breakthrough in resolving",
    "the background came in the late 1990s , with imaging by the submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) .",
    "its initial surveys at 850@xmath4 m  @xcite detected a new population of bright ( @xmath8mjy ) galaxies .",
    "named after the wavelengths where they are most visible , these submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) are systems with apparently vast ( @xmath9 ) bolometric luminosities but with such high obscurations that their optical counterparts are faint or absent ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "smgs brighter than scuba s confusion limits could not account for all of the 850@xmath4 m  background , but clearly made a substantial contribution to it .    over the last fifteen years",
    ", much of the effort to understand the origins of the far - ir / submillimeter background has focused on bright smgs selected from 8501200@xmath4 m  surveys .",
    "smgs are sometimes treated as representatives of a more general category of high - redshift galaxies , dusty star - forming galaxies ( dsfgs ) whose luminosities are dominated by obscured star formation .",
    "a major initial hurdle was verifying that bright smgs actually do lie at high redshifts .",
    "while two early scuba detections had optical redshifts @xcite , quickly confirmed with co spectroscopy @xcite , progress in measuring redshifts of other smgs foundered due to their very high obscurations . only after @xcite took advantage of radio continuum mapping to determine precise positions for blind optical spectroscopy did it become possible to obtain co detections in large numbers @xcite , and to derive an smg redshift distribution peaking around @xmath102.5 @xcite .",
    "heroic efforts to explore the high-@xmath11 tail that radio pre - selection misses when radio counterparts fall below typical survey flux limits have identified a handful of sources at @xmath12 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but detailed analysis limits the possible significance of this tail in the @xmath13 mm population @xcite .",
    "we now know that bright smgs have large stellar @xcite , molecular gas @xcite , and dynamical @xcite masses , that many of them are mergers @xcite , and that their large luminosities are powered principally by star formation @xcite .",
    "explaining the observed properties of bright smgs , their evolutionary states , and their relationships to populations of galaxies selected at other wavelengths is a current major challenge for galaxy evolution models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in parallel with the growth in our understanding of bright smgs",
    ", it is also becoming clear that current samples give an incomplete picture of the full variety of dsfgs .",
    "first , 850@xmath4 m  sources fainter than scuba s nominal confusion limit of about 2  mjy , although accessible via gravitational lensing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , must at some point start to resemble optically selected galaxies more than heavily obscured smgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second , even among bright dsfgs , 850@xmath4m - bright smgs have distinct selection biases .",
    "dsfg samples selected at longer wavelengths appear to have cooler dust temperatures and higher median redshifts @xcite .",
    "dsfg samples selected at shorter wavelengths , conversely , include populations with warmer dust that 850@xmath4m - selected samples can miss , @xcite , and that tend to have both lower redshifts and more bolometrically significant active galactic nuclei ( agns ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "third , existing samples of smgs with spectroscopic redshifts often suffer from biases associated with the steps used to determine those redshifts .",
    "for example , precise localization of a submillimeter source usually relies on radio continuum mapping , and while the deepest vla imaging yields counterparts for a high fraction of dsfgs @xcite , more typical vla maps tend to deliver counterparts for only 6070% of smgs .",
    "subsequent optical spectroscopy based on these positions fails to yield redshifts for a modest fraction of candidates @xcite , and even when apparently successful , attempts to obtain co detections of the gas reservoirs associated with these massive starbursts can sometimes fail to yield conclusive confirmation , raising questions over either the identification or redshift @xcite .",
    "mid - ir spectroscopy can avoid some of these difficulties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but suffers from its own problems for sources with power - law spectra or confusion from multiple sources within large beams or slits .",
    "finally , many of the seminal studies of smgs mapped relatively small areas on the sky . notwithstanding the large line - of - sight interval probed by 850@xmath4mselection , which can partly compensate for a small area , smgs are such rare sources ( mergers caught at special moments , with the most luminous caught at the most special of moments ) that cosmic variance remains a concern for the derived redshift distributions .",
    "new instruments capable of producing deep images of large regions of the sky , and of conducting efficient spectral surveys over wide bandwidths , have accelerated the discovery of high - redshift dsfgs with a broader range of physical properties than could be probed by previous efforts .",
    "survey areas at @xmath14 mm have increased substantially ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with extremely wide - area surveys possible both from the ground @xcite , and from space with the _ herschel space observatory _ @xcite .",
    "large - area surveys are identifying many very bright dsfgs whose fluxes are rivaled by those of only a few extreme , serendipitously discovered objects that have been confirmed to be gravitationally lensed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "regardless of the balance between intrinsically hyperluminous systems and less extreme but gravitationally lensed galaxies within these samples , we are no longer missing the rarest dsfgs because of limited sky coverage .",
    "_ herschel _ is playing a particularly important role because the wavelength coverage of its spire instrument @xcite allows selection of dsfg samples that are relatively free of dust temperature biases @xcite , although they are limited by confusion to only the most extreme luminosity systems at @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "specialized instruments designed for wide - band spectral line surveys now enable the determination of blind co redshifts ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for bright dsfgs , without intermediate radio continuum mapping or optical spectroscopy .",
    "an example of the combination of these new developments is the recent use of two wide - bandwidth instruments to obtain co redshifts for a complete sample of five bright _ herschel _ sources @xcite , an essential step in confirming their status as galaxy - galaxy lenses @xcite .",
    "expanding on this initial work , we here report on @xmath14 cm",
    "spectroscopy of the @xmath0c@xmath1o @xmath2 ground - state rotational transition toward two dozen of the brightest dsfgs in catalogs from the _ herschel _ astrophysical terahertz large area survey ( h - atlas ; * ? ? ?",

    "submillimeter continuum flux ratios provide some coarse redshift information for many sources , but the precise redshifts needed to enable additional observations with narrow - band instruments require spectroscopy of atomic or molecular lines .",
    "the zpectrometer is one of several ultra - wideband spectrometers built for this purpose , and is the first instrument to make routine measurements of the co @xmath16 rotational transition from high - redshift galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ?",

    "115.27ghz @xmath2 transition at redshifts of @xmath28 .",
    "the zpectrometer s spectral resolution is a sinc function with full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 20mhz , sufficient to provide a few resolution elements across typical galaxy lineshapes .",
    "given the instrument s wide overall bandwidth , the spectral resolution varied with frequency across the spectra from 234 to 157kms@xmath29 , and the fwhm beamsize from 27 to 16 arcsec .",
    "a combination of the correlation receiver s ability to difference power between two beams on the sky and the zpectrometer s large bandwidth allows different observing techniques from those common in narrowband total - power radio astronomy .",
    "our instrument , observing technique , data reduction , and calibration methods are fully described in @xcite .",
    "briefly , the correlation receiver implementation electrically differences power between the receiver s two input horns , which are separated by 78arcsec on the sky .",
    "we switched the source between the two horns by moving the gbt s secondary mirror 78arcsec in a 10s cycle , then differencing spectra from the two positions to obtain a source spectrum . to eliminate the residual tens of mjy of spectral baseline structure from optical offsets , we observed pairs of targets close in position on the sky , cycling between sources every 4min , again differencing this pair .",
    "in this difference spectrum of the two positions an emission line from the first source would appear in the positive sense , while one from the second source would appear in the negative sense .",
    "differencing left little optical offset and baseline structure , at the cost of eliminating information about individual source continua .",
    "observations were conducted in sessions of 3 to 8 hours duration ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) on dates from 2010 november through 2011 april for a total of 64.5hr of on - sky observing time .",
    "counting observing overheads , the actual elapsed observing time was about 130hr .",
    "we observed in a variety of weather conditions , mostly with reasonable to good ka - band atmospheric transmission and low wind .",
    "we established absolute flux scales across the spectra by dividing the astronomical source difference spectra by the spectrum of a bright ( few jy ) quasar suitable as a pointing reference near each target pair . in some cases",
    "we could use one of the cm - wave flux standards 3c48 , 3c286 , or 3c147 directly ( 0.80 , 1.83 , 1.47jy at 32ghz , respectively ; @xcite 2011 ) , but for most of our sources we cross - calibrated spectra of the nearby pointing source with one or more of the standards .",
    "we cross - checked 3c48 s flux density from @xcite against a mars flux density model by b.  butlerbbutler / work / mars / model/ ] and found agreement within 2% .",
    "comparison with the recommended 2012 january jansky - vla flux density for 3c286 is 1.96jy ( 7% higher ) than the value we use , and we find a ka - band spectral index of @xmath30 instead of the jansky - vla s @xmath31 .",
    "cross - calibrations of the flux density for the quasar we used for the gama09 sources against all three of the standards agreed within 10% .",
    "we determine calibrator spectral indices across the ka - band , which can be important in transferring the 32ghz standard fluxes to other frequencies in the band , by comparison with mars blackbody @xmath32 .",
    "we pointed and focused every hour on the bright quasars we had selected as secondary flux calibrators near our sources .",
    "pointing offsets were always within a third of a beam near band center .",
    "we took spectra of the pointing source at the beginning and end of each pointing cycle to measure changes in optical gain and atmospheric transmission . dividing the difference spectrum of an astronomical source pair by the average spectrum of the pointing source",
    "not only corrected for bandpass gain but also for the effects of pointing errors and changing atmospheric transmission with timescales comparable to an hour , or longer .",
    "session to session repeatability for the quasar flux densities was generally within 10% , and we take 20% as representative of the overall amplitude calibration uncertainty to include gain effects from pointing drift .",
    "version d of the zpectrometer s standard gbtidl scripts provided quick - look assessment during observations and produced files for combining data from different sessions .",
    "we used version 5.4 of our zred package , which is written in the r language @xcite , for further analysis .",
    "the receiver produced systematic spectral structure with fluctuating amplitude across many of the spectra .",
    "spectral lines from galaxies were much narrower than features in the systematic structures , which enabled us to remove the instrumental artifacts ( * ? ? ?",
    "* contains further information ) .",
    "we removed a systematic ripple with fourier filtering and a complex but fixed - pattern structure by fitting and subtracting median - filtered session - average templates of the structure .",
    "we removed no further baseline structure , and with these corrections we could keep nearly all of the data .      in this exploratory phase of a full survey , we set integration times to identify bright co sources rather than to get high signal - to - noise ratios on individual sources .",
    "since system noise changes across the zpectrometer s 12.1ghz band and nonideal noise is clearly present , attempting to estimate noise for signal - to - noise ratios by computing the channel fluctuations across the spectrum s entire frequency range would overestimate noise in some parts of the spectrum and underestimate it in others .",
    "instead , we harness time - series information from sub - integrations to make individual channel noise estimates as part of a detection confidence algorithm . @xcite",
    "has a complete discussion of this algorithm , which analyzes whether the amplitude in each frequency channel is statistically higher than the average of its neighbors , based on a generalized student-@xmath33 test of many bootstrapped realizations of each spectrum .",
    "the algorithm s main advantage over traditional methods is that it treats noise in individual frequency channels .",
    "its main weakness stems from its assumption that the underlying spectral baselines are relatively smooth on small scales so that local averages are representative . failure of this assumption keeps the computed confidence level from being absolute , as discontinuities in spectral baselines and small fluctuations near bright features can all register as potential detections .",
    "our experience with the algorithm on zpectrometer data is very good , based on comparisons of tentative detections within subsets of data and from detections of different lines from the same galaxies with other instruments .",
    "given deviations from the assumptions caused by nonideal noise of a few hundred @xmath4jy , the algorithm remains a powerful guide rather than an exact indicator for identifying weak lines .",
    "experience gained from viewing many spectra toward different sources under different weather conditions , but all with the same frequency coverage , provides valuable impressions of typical baseline structures and noise behavior , further aiding in screening against spurious detections .",
    "all detections here come from at least two independent observing sessions , and most have at least tentative detections in individual sessions . by generating 1000 bootstrapped spectra as part of the detection algorithm , the data are thoroughly mixed by time and session .",
    "sweeping through a wide range of binnings ensures that a detection is not based on a single favorable choice .",
    "we have been conservative in our decisions , while recognizing that a small number of false positives are more beneficial than false negatives in observations designed to spur followup work . in practice ,",
    "independent observations of other lines from the same targets have justified our detection selections .",
    "panels in figure  [ fig : spectra ] show the spectra and confidence plots for all of the source pairs we observed .",

    "each dot in the plot is an individual channel s confidence measure ( within the algorithm s assumptions ) for a given combination of binning width and starting point .",

    "galaxies with redshifts @xmath74 may be somewhat warmer than those at lower redshift .",
    "the co linewidths have very similar distributions for these h - atlas co @xmath2 detections and for smgs observed in mid-@xmath45 lines . both of these comparisons add further to an argument that the bulk of samples selected by bright 850@xmath4 m  and spire emission draw from the same parent population .",
    "most , if not all , of the galaxies we observed appear to be gravitationally lensed .",
    "we estimate lens magnifications with an empirical co linewidth - luminosity relationship made possible with velocity - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "we verified magnification agreement within factors close to two for two galaxies with published lens modeling .",
    "we find magnifications from 3 to 20 , a range matching those for lenses with detailed models , @xmath17830 @xcite . in the absence of other information ,",
    "a typical value of @xmath84 is likely to be correct within a factor of two for the bright h - atlas galaxies .    with even moderately accurate lens magnification estimates",
    ", we can make reasonable estimates of intrinsic luminosities and gas masses of the galaxies in our sample ( table  [ tab : galprops ] ) .",
    "most have luminosities characteristic of ulirgs , but there are three targets that could be hyper - lirgs with luminosities @xmath179 .",
    "the most luminous of these could well be multiple galaxies within the beam , as their linewidths are broad . even accounting for lensing magnification",
    ", however , the bright h - atlas galaxies seem to be drawn from the high - luminosity , high - mass end of the dsfg distribution .",
    "the overall agreement in properties between the zpectrometer and 8501200@xmath4m - selected smg samples indicates that the two populations are drawn from the same distribution . in principle , the additional selection introduced by lens magnification could have emphasized different properties from the smg population , but it does not appear to have done so .",
    "lensed sources will be valuable in understanding the properties of the underlying dsfg population , including the smgs : for observations , magnification by even a factor of a few translates to an order of magnitude reduction in integration time .",
    "detailed studies of the galaxies interstellar media in multiple molecular and atomic lines becomes feasible in the bright lensed sample ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with magnification also increasing spatial resolution in the source plane ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "overall , the detection fraction of about half of the targets compares well with other programs that observed molecular lines from high redshift galaxies .",
    "a conservative extrapolation of a co - to - continuum intensity relationship indicates that the nondetection rate is substantially higher than expected from chance alone , evidence that some of the simple photometric redshifts are incorrect .",
    "our selection is from spire photometry identification of `` 350@xmath4 m  peakers . ''",
    "comparison of the spire data and co redshifts indicates that the continuum peak wavelength , deduced from the 250@xmath4m/500@xmath4 m  flux density ratio , predicts the redshift of the galaxies from our carefully - selected sample with @xmath180 .",
    "the spire colors do not necessarily provide accurate estimates for galaxies we do not detect , however .",
    "a simple explanation for some of the nondetections is emission from dust warmer than the @xmath181k characteristic for most of the galaxies with co detections .",
    "the redshift - temperature degeneracy for the observed peak emission wavelength , @xmath182 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) causes problems for photometric selection in the spire bands alone : warmer galaxies with redshift above the zpectrometer s upper limit will appear in the target list .",
    "it is very likely that this is the reason for the nondetection of the target with third - brightest 350@xmath4 m  flux density in this study .",
    "reasons other than warm galaxies or co intensities that fall below our observational limit can also contribute to nondetections .",
    "emission from multiple galaxies within the beam at one or more wavelengths can contribute flux to distort the apparent sed , leading to erroneous redshifts from single - component models .",
    "this is likely to affect weaker sources preferentially , both because smaller absolute amounts of contaminating flux are increasingly important and because the density of contaminating sources increases with decreasing flux .",
    "multiple distinct temperature components within a source , for instance a central agn - heated dust region surrounded by less excited material , will also distort the sed . depending upon the temperature structure within the source and the size and position of the source relative to any lens caustic , differential amplification could distort observed seds .",
    "seds in all these cases will be poorly represented by the simple single - component model we have used in target selection , and photometric redshifts based on spire data alone will fail to some extent .    the observed redshift distribution and the dust sed properties hint at some change in dsfg properties near @xmath183 .",
    "the redshift cumulative distribution functions for both the zpectrometer and @xcite samples show a slope break at @xmath184 although they are selected in different ways .",
    "this indicates that dsfgs become less common , or are selected less efficiently by continuum properties , above that redshift .",
    "an increase in the number of warm galaxies with redshift would both explain the tentative trend in temperature we see and explain the lower co detection rate .",
    "temperature alone may not suffice to explain the break , and explanations involving more complex seds with increasing redshift are attractive as well .",
    "@xcite use extensive optical and infrared photometry on a sample of 74 870@xmath4m - selected smgs , also finding a precipitous drop in submillimeter source counts above @xmath185 in spite of their sensitivity to emission from warm dust .",
    "increased sample sizes are necessary to establish whether there is a real change in dsfg properties near @xmath183 or not .",
    "the co data presented here are among the earliest spectroscopic explorations of _ herschel_-selected galaxies .",
    "continuing observations of the co @xmath2 line by the gbt and jansky - vla will provide a more diverse sample of galaxies : some from broadened continuum selection criteria , and some with deeper integrations to reach weaker line emission .",
    "wideband spectrometers now coming on line for the 3 mm band at the lmt and iram 30 m will also add to the number of galaxies with known molecular redshifts .",
    "an expanded sample will strengthen our understanding of the relationship between molecular and continuum emission in dsfgs .",
