    "the theory of @xmath0-betti numbers has been generalized to a vast number of different contexts since the seminal work of atiyah @xcite .",
    "one recent such generalization is due to connes and shlyakhtenko @xcite who introduced @xmath0-betti numbers for subalgebras of finite von neumann algebras , with the main purpose being to obtain a suitable notion for arbitrary ii@xmath2-factors .",
    "although their definitions are very natural , it has proven to be quite difficult to perform concrete calculations .",
    "the most advanced computational result so far is due to thom @xcite who proved that the @xmath0-betti numbers vanish for von neumann algebras with diffuse center .",
    "notably , the problem of computing a positive degree @xmath0-betti number for a single ii@xmath2-factor has remained open for a decade at the time of writing ! due to",
    "this evident drawback , thom @xcite introduced a continuous version of the first @xmath0-betti number , which turns out to be much more manageable than its algebraic counterpart . the first continuous @xmath0-betti number is defined as the von neumann dimension of the first continuous hochschild cohomology of the von neumann algebra @xmath3 with values in the algebra of operators affiliated with @xmath4 .",
    "the word ` continuous ' here means that we restrict attention to those derivations that are continuous from the norm topology on @xmath3 to the measure topology on the affiliated operators .",
    "+ in this paper we continue the study of thom s continuous version of the first @xmath0-betti number and our first result ( theorem [ sot - mt - cont ] ) shows that norm continuous derivations are automatically also continuous for both the strong operator topology and the measure topology .",

    "* theorem 2.2 ) ) . in particular , for @xmath1-factors not a single computation of a positive degree @xmath0-betti is known , and furthermore this seems out of reach with tools available at the moment .",
    "it is therefore natural to consider variations of the definitions above that take into account the topological nature of @xmath3 , and in @xcite thom suggests to consider a first cohomology group consisting of ( equivalence classes of ) those derivations @xmath42 that are closable from the norm topology to the measure topology .",

    "in this section we prove that a derivation which is continuous for the norm topology is automatically continuous for the strong operator topology and the measure topology as well .",

    "the norm - measure topology boundedness of @xmath59 on @xmath96 implies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.32 ) that the set @xmath97 is bounded in @xmath27 .",

    ", we may now define @xmath109 ; it is routine to check that this yields a well - defined derivation @xmath60 .",
    "the continuity of the extension follows from its definition from which it is clear that the set @xmath110 is contained in the measure topology closure of the bounded set @xmath111 which is again bounded by ( * ? ? ?",

    "if @xmath60 is a norm continuous derivation , then by repeating the above arguments for @xmath112 , @xmath113 , we get strong continuity of @xmath59 on bounded sets : if @xmath114 and the sequence @xmath103 is uniformly bounded , then @xmath115 .",
    "since strong convergence implies @xmath0-convergence it also implies convergence in measure by lemma [ lp - lem ] , and hence it suffices to prove that @xmath59 is measure - measure continuous . to this end , by metrizability of the measure topology it suffices to take a sequence @xmath116 such that @xmath117 and prove that @xmath118 .",

    "the third summand converges to @xmath127 in measure because @xmath132 and multiplication is measure continuous .",
    "this finishes the proof .",

    "multiplying by the unitaries @xmath138 , we infer @xmath139 .",
    "bearing in mind the numerous automatic continuity results for derivations between operator algebras ( see @xcite and references therein ) , it is of course natural to ask if norm continuity of a derivation @xmath60 is also automatic . we were not able to prove this , and it seems to be a difficult question to answer .",
    "one reason being the absence of examples of finite von neumann algebras ( or @xmath88-algebras , for that matter ) for which a non - inner derivation into the algebra @xmath27 is known to exist .",
    "moreover , the fact that we are considering the operators affiliated with @xmath4 ( as opposed to @xmath3 itself ) has to play a role if automatic norm continuity is to be proven , as there are examples of derivations from @xmath3 into the operators affiliated with @xmath3 which are not norm - measure topology continuous .",
    "this follows from @xcite where the authors exhibit a ( commutative ) finite von neumann algebra @xmath3 for which there exists a derivation @xmath140 which is not measure - measure continuous .",
    "if the restriction @xmath141 were norm - measure continuous , then it is not difficult to see that the graph of the original derivation @xmath59 is closed ( in the product of the measure topologies ) , and hence it can not be discontinuous . if norm continuity turns out to be automatic , there is of course no difference between the ordinary and the continuous @xmath0-betti numbers , and one might even take the standpoint that if there is no such automatic continuity , then continuity has to be imposed in order to get a satisfactory theory .",
    "in this section we apply the above automatic continuity result to obtain information about the first continuous @xmath0-betti number for von neumann algebras .",
    "some of the results presented are already known , or implicit in the literature , but since the proofs are knew and quite simple we hope they will shed new light on these results .",
    "the main new result in this section is theorem [ beta-1-of - t - factor ] which shows that the first continuous @xmath0-betti number vanishes for property @xmath5 factors .",

    "the next lemma , which might be of independent interest , shows that if a von neumann algebra only allows inner derivations into the algebra of operators affiliated with its double , then the same is true for the algebra of operators affiliated with the double of any ambient von neumann algebra .        by @xcite",
