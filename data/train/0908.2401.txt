    "although sometimes sidestepped , it is a general requirement in studying non vacuum spacetimes in general relativity that the energy momentum tensor , that is the matter ( field ) contents , should have a clear , although possibly highly idealized , physical interpretation . among these choices",
    "the case where matter is described as a large ensemble of particles that interact only through the gravitational field that they themselves , at least partially , create , is of particular interest , both because of their usefulness in modeling physical systems such as star o galaxy clusters , and of the possibility of a relatively detailed analysis , at least in some restricted cases . as usual in theoretical treatments ,",
    "one starts imposing as many restrictions as compatible with the central idea , and then tries to generalize from these cases . in this respect , the restriction to static spherically symmetric systems provides an important simplification , although even with this restriction the problem is far from trivial , and further restrictions have been imposed in order to make significant advances .",
    "one of the first concrete examples is that provided by the einstein model @xcite , where the particles are restricted to move on circular orbits .",
    "this model is static , and it is not easy to generalize as such to include a dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "this generalization can , however , be achieved if the particle world lines are restricted to a shell of vanishing thickness ( `` thin shell '' ) , as considered by evans in @xcite .",
    "the analysis in @xcite , although , motivated by the einstein model , considers only shells where all the component particles have the same value of their ( conserved ) angular momentum . in a recent study @xcite of the dynamics of spherically symmetric thin shells of counter rotating particles ,",
    "of which @xcite is an example , it was found that the analysis can be extended to shells where the particles have angular momenta that take values on a discrete ( but possibly also continuous ) set , and is not restricted to a single value .",
    "it was also found that in the non trivial thin shell limit of a thick einstein shell the angular momentum of the particles acquires a unique continuous distribution , and , therefore , the models in @xcite and @xcite are not approximations to an einstein model .",
    "a relevant question then is what , if any , are the ( thick ) shells that are approximated by those in @xcite and @xcite . in this paper",
    "we look for an answer to this question by considering a generalization of the einstein model where instead of circular orbits we impose , at first , the restriction to a single value of the angular momentum .",
    "the particle contents is described by a distribution function @xmath1 in phase space , and , because of the assumption of interaction only through the mean gravitational field , @xmath1 must satisfy the einstein - vlasov equations @xcite . in the next section we set up the problem and show that it leads to a well defined set of equations . in section iii we set up and analyze a particular model , obtaining expansions for the metric functions at the boundary of the support of @xmath1 , appropriate for numerical analysis .",
    "further properties are analyzed in section iv , where we show that all these shells have finite thickness .",
    "section v contains numerical results for a generic example .",
    "the `` thin shell '' limit is considered in section vi , both through analytic arguments and a concrete numerical example , with the results showing total agreement with the thin shell results of @xcite .",
    "a further comparison with @xcite is carried out in section vii , where the stability of a shell approaching the thin shell limit is considered . the generalization to more than one value of @xmath0 is given in section viii , where we find that particles with different values of @xmath0 may be distributed on shells that overlap completely , or do so only partially or not at all .",
    "numerical examples and a comparisons with @xcite are finally developed in section ix . some comment and conclusions",
    "are given in section x.",
    "the metric for a static spherically symmetric spacetime may be written in the form , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the line element on the unit sphere and @xmath4 .    for a static , spherically symmetric system ,",
    "the matter contents , in this case equal mass collisionless particles , is microscopically described by a distribution function @xmath5 , where @xmath6 are the components of the particle momentum , taken per unit mass .",
    "then , as a consequence of the assumption that the particles move along geodesics of the space time metric , the distribution function @xmath7 satisfies the vlasov equation , which , in this case , takes the form , @xmath8 where @xmath9 correspond to @xmath10 .",
    "it is understood in ( [ vlasov1 ] ) that @xmath11 is to be computed using @xmath12 , so as to satisfy the `` mass shell restriction '' @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the particles mass .",
    "therefore , in what follows we set , @xmath15}\\ ] ]    we also notice that @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is proper time along the particle s world line .",

    "the assumption that the metric is static and spherically symmetric implies conservation of the particle s energy , @xmath23}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and of the square of its angular momentum per unit mass , @xmath24\\ ] ] it is easy to check that the ansatz , @xmath25 where @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are the functions of @xmath28 , and @xmath29 given by ( [ energy1],[lsquare ] ) , solves the vlasov equation for an arbitrary function @xmath30 . + to construct and solve explicit models based on ( [ ansatz01 ] ) for the metric ( [ one1 ] ) , it is convenient to change integration variables in ( [ tmunu1 ] ) .",
    "we set , @xmath31 and write ( [ tmunu1 ] ) in the form , @xmath32 where we should set , @xmath33    andreasson and rein @xcite have explored the properties of models where @xmath30 takes the form , @xmath34    in this note we consider a different type of models , based on the ansatz , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the heaviside step function , and @xmath37 is dirac s @xmath38 ; namely , we assume that @xmath0 takes only the single value @xmath39 , and that there is an upper bound on @xmath26 , given by @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 is assumed to be a smooth function of @xmath26 .",
    "we then have , @xmath42 where @xmath43 depends on @xmath28 and is given by , @xmath44 if @xmath45 , and @xmath46 otherwise .",
    "this simply states the fact that @xmath47 only in those regions where a ( test ) particle with energy @xmath40 and angular momentum @xmath39 can actually move .",
    "we may now use the previous results to construct simple models and analyze their interpretation for a range of possible parameters .",
    "this analysis may be carried out in a number of ways . here",
    "we choose the following ; we first use a gauge freedom in the metric ( [ one1 ] ) to set , @xmath48 then , from the einstein equations and the form ( [ tmunu2 ] ) of @xmath49 , we find two independent equations for @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 where , @xmath53 is the energy density , and @xmath54 is the radial pressure , given by ( [ tmunu2 ] ) , with @xmath55 . there is also an equation for @xmath56 , but , as can be checked , this is not independent of ( [ two2 ] ) . equations ( [ two2 ] ) are deceivingly simple , because the explicit dependence of @xmath57 and @xmath58 on @xmath59 and @xmath60 is in general quite complicated . here",
    "we consider a simple example and propose a method for constructing the solutions , that is illustrated by the example .",
    "it can be seen that some simplification is attained if we choose , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a constant . with this choice",
    "we may perform the integrals in ( [ tmunu2 ] ) explicitly and , after some simplifications , we get , @xmath63\\sqrt{r^2 e_0 ^ 2 - ( l_0 ^ 2+r^2)b}}{r^3 b } \\\\ \\label{two4b } \\frac{d b}{dr } & = & \\frac{2 m b}{r(r-2 m ) } + \\frac{2q_2\\left[r^2 e_0 ^ 2- ( l_0 ^ 2+r^2)b\\right]^{3/2}}{r^3(r-2m)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 .",
    "we also find , @xmath65\\sqrt{r^2 e_0 ^ 2 - ( l_0 ^ 2+r^2)b}}{4 \\pi r^5 b } \\nonumber \\\\",

    "we have not found closed ( analytical ) solutions for the system , and , therefore , we must resort to numerical methods .",
    "the application of these methods requires , however , considering and solving several subtleties inherent in the system .",
    "as indicated above , in all these equations ( ( [ two4a],[two4b ] ) and ( [ two5 ] ) ) , the terms involving @xmath66 should be set equal to zero if @xmath67 .",
    "we notice that for @xmath68 we have @xmath69 with @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is also a constant , corresponding to the standard schwarzschild solution . for a shell type solution , these solutions correspond to the inner and outer regions , to be matched to the region where @xmath47 .",
    "when @xmath73 , since we must have @xmath74 , we must also have @xmath75 , but , even though @xmath76 we might end up with @xmath77 , and still have all equations satisfied .    for shell like solutions , either with an empty interior or with a central mass ( black hole ) , a further difficulty can be seen considering that there should exist an `` allowed region '' where @xmath78 , with @xmath28 taking values in the interval @xmath79 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are , respectively , the inner and outer radii of the shell .",
    "we must impose continuity in both @xmath51 and @xmath50 to avoid @xmath38 functions in @xmath49 .",
    "this implies that @xmath82 is continuous in @xmath79 and approaches continuously the value zero at the boundaries .",
    "therefore , both @xmath83 and @xmath84 are also continuous inside and at the boundaries of this interval , and actually we have @xmath85 .",
    "we also find that @xmath86 should be continuous , but @xmath87 must be singular , and this makes the construction of numerical solutions where we try to fix from the beginning the values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 rather difficult .",
    "nevertheless , the above analysis indicates that for @xmath88 , but @xmath89 , we should have , @xmath90 where @xmath72 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 are constants and @xmath93 and @xmath94 are functions of @xmath28 that vanish respectively faster than @xmath95 and @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "it is straightforward to extend this analysis to higher order by imposing consistency between the right and left hand sides of ( [ two4a],[two4b ] ) as @xmath97 .",
    "we find , @xmath98 where @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 are constants , and @xmath103 and @xmath104 stand for higher order terms .",
    "the constants appearing in ( [ two7 ] ) are not independent .",
    "they may be written , e.g. , in terms of @xmath80 , @xmath92 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath66 .",
    "we notice that @xmath92 is the schwarzschild mass for the region inside the shell ( @xmath105 ) . moreover , the system ( [ two4a],[two4b ] ) is invariant under the the rescaling @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 .",
    "the condition that @xmath109 corresponds to the inner boundary of the shell implies , @xmath110 similarly , we find , @xmath111 the explicit expressions for @xmath100 and @xmath102 are also easily obtained but are rather long and will not be included here , although they were used in the numerical computations described below .",
    "an interesting question regarding the model of the previous section is related to the possible values that the thickness of the shells can attain .",
    "this may be analyzed by considering the limit of solutions of the system ( [ two4a],[two4b ] ) as @xmath112 , under the restrictions that @xmath113 , and @xmath114 .",
    "the first , according to ( [ two4a],[two4b ] ) and ( [ two5 ] ) , implies @xmath115 , and @xmath116 .",
    "we remark that @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , @xmath51 must approach @xmath72 monotonically from below .",
    "consider first the case @xmath118 .",
    "replacing in the first equation in ( [ two4a],[two4b ] ) , for large @xmath28 we find that @xmath83 approaches a constant value , and , therefore , @xmath50 grows linearly with @xmath28 .",
    "but then , replacing in the second equation in ( [ two4a],[two4b ] ) , we find that @xmath84 decreases as @xmath119 , leading to a logarithmic growth in @xmath51 , incompatible with the assumed conditions",
    ". therefore , any possible solution should have @xmath120 .",
    "then , for large @xmath28 we should have , @xmath121 with @xmath122 , as @xmath123 . replacing now in ( [ two4a],[two4b ] ) , to leading order we find , @xmath124 and this implies that @xmath125 as @xmath112 . then , using again ( [ two4a],[two4b ] ) , we should have , @xmath126 and this implies @xmath127 , which contradicts the assumption @xmath128 .",
    "thus we conclude that the equation , @xmath129 must always be satisfied for finite @xmath28 , and , therefore , _ all shells constructed in accordance with the prescription ( [ two3 ] ) have finite mass and finite thickness_.    we nevertheless believe that this results is more general , and applies to all shells satisfying the ansatz ( [ model01 ] ) , although we do not have a complete proof of this statement .",
    "as indicated , we do not have closed solutions of the equations for @xmath51 and @xmath50 , even for the simple model of the previous section .",
    "nevertheless , since ( [ two4a],[two4b ] ) is a first order ode system , we can apply numerical methods to analyze it .",
    "we may use the expansions ( [ two7 ] ) , ( disregarding the terms in @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) , to obtain appropriate initial values for @xmath51 and @xmath50 , for @xmath28 close to @xmath80 , in the non trivial region @xmath88 .",
    "we may illustrate this point with a particular example .",
    "we take @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 . using these values and ( [ two7 ] )",
    "( truncated as indicated above ) , we find @xmath135 , and @xmath136 ( actually , the computations were carried out to 30 digits , using a runge - kutta integrator ) .",
    "the numerical results are plotted in figure 1 and figure 2 .",
    "one of the motivations for studying the type of shells considered in this paper is the possible existence of a non trivial `` thin shell '' limit , where the thickness of the shell goes to zero , with the restriction to a single or a finite set of values of @xmath0 , and how this limit compares with the thin shells considered in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we remark that the existence of thin shell limits of einstein - vlasov systems has already been analyzed in the literature @xcite . here",
    "we are interested not only in the existence of this limit for our particular models , but especially in the limiting values of the parameters characterizing our shells .",
    "since this type of analysis is not immediately included in , e.g , @xcite , we consider it relevant to provide an explicit proof of the properties of our models in the thin shell limit .",
    "we first recall that for a static thin shell constructed according to evans prescriptions @xcite , we have the following relation between the radius @xmath137 , inner ( @xmath92 ) and outer ( @xmath101 ) mass , and angular momentum @xmath138 of the particles , @xmath139    we may now prove that the non trivial thin shell limits of the shells constructed according to the prescription ( [ two3 ] ) effectively coincide with the evans shells of reference @xcite as follows .",
    "we first take the @xmath28 derivative of ( [ two4b ] ) , and then use ( [ two4a ] ) and ( [ two4b ] , to obtain , @xmath140}{r(e^2 r^2 + 2(l^2+r^2)b)(r-2m)}\\frac{dm}{dr } \\nonumber \\\\   & &   -\\frac{4 } { r^2(r-2m)}\\left[r(r-2m)\\frac{db}{dr}-m b\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    next let @xmath80 and @xmath81 be , respectively , the inner and outer radii of the shell , and @xmath141 and @xmath142 the corresponding masses inside and outside the shell .",
    "then , for @xmath79 we have @xmath143 , and , @xmath144    the idea now is to use the fact that , @xmath145    on this account we rewrite ( [ thin01 ] ) in the form , @xmath146}\\frac{d^2b}{dr^2 }   \\nonumber \\\\   & &   + \\frac{4 ( e^2 r^2 + 2b(l^2+r^2))\\left[r(r-2m)\\frac{db}{dr}-m b\\right ] }   { r ( r-2m)\\left [ r(2 e^2 + ( r^2+l^2)b)\\dfrac{db}{dr}+2(4e^2r^2+(2l^2-r^2)b)\\right]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and integrate both sides from @xmath109 to @xmath147 .",
    "but now we notice that while both @xmath50 and @xmath84 are rapidly changing but bounded in @xmath79 , the change of @xmath51 , and @xmath28 in that interval is only of order @xmath148",
    ". we may then choose a point @xmath149 , with @xmath150 , and set @xmath151 , and @xmath149 , except in the arguments of @xmath50 , @xmath83 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 , in ( [ thin04 ] ) , as this introduces errors at most of order @xmath148 , in the factors of @xmath83 , and @xmath153 , and in the last term in the right hand side of ( [ thin04 ] ) .",
    "similarly , we may set @xmath154 in ( [ thin04 ] ) , to obtain , up to terms of order @xmath148 , @xmath155 }   { r ( r-2m)\\left[r(r^2+l^2)\\dfrac{db}{dr}+2(r^2 + 2 l^2)b_0\\right]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and , again , we notice that the last term on the right of ( [ thin05 ] ) gives a contribution of order @xmath148 .",
    "we then conclude that , @xmath156 the integration of the terms in @xmath83 , and @xmath153 , is now straightforward .",
    "we use next ( [ thin02 ] ) and the fact that in this limit @xmath157 and @xmath158 , to obtain , @xmath159    solving this equation for @xmath27 , we finally find , @xmath160 which is , precisely , the relation satisfied by the parameters of the shells of ( [ five1 ] ) .    we can also check this result , and , in turn , the accuracy of numerical codes , by directly considering initial data for the numerical integration that effectively lead to shells where the thickness is a small fraction of the radius .",
    "a particular example is given in figure 3 , where the values of the initial data is also indicated .",
    "we can see that the mass increases by about @xmath161 percent , while the thickness of the shell is less than @xmath162 percent of the shell radius .",
    "we can check that these results are in agreement with ( [ five1 ] ) . solving this for @xmath101 , @xmath163 } { ( r-2m_1)(r^2 + 3 \\tilde{l}_0 ^ 2)^2 } \\ ] ] and replacing @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and @xmath166 ,",
    "we find @xmath167 in very good agreement with the numerical results quoted in figure 3 .",
    "consider a shell approaching the thin shell limit .",
    "we restrict to the case of vanishing inner mass @xmath168 .",
    "if @xmath80 and @xmath81 are , respectively the inner and outer boundaries of the shell , the matching conditions in the absence of singular shells at @xmath80 and @xmath81 imply that both @xmath50 and @xmath51 and their first derivatives should be continuous at both @xmath109 and @xmath147 . the form ( [ one1 ] ) of the metric with the choice ( [ two1 ] ) imply that for @xmath169 we have , @xmath170 where @xmath171 is a constant .",
    "then , at @xmath109 we have , @xmath172    for @xmath173 , the metric takes the form , @xmath174 where @xmath175 is another constant satisfying , @xmath176    consider now a test particle moving along a geodesic of the shell space time , with 4-velocity @xmath177 , with @xmath178 . without loss of generality we may choose @xmath179 .",
    "then we have the constants of the motion : @xmath180 and the normalization of @xmath181 implies , @xmath182 therefore , for @xmath183 we have , @xmath184 and the particle radial acceleration is given by , @xmath185 if we assume now that the shell is close to the thin shell limit , with angular momentum @xmath39 , radius @xmath137 , ( with @xmath150 ) , and mass @xmath101 , then we should have , @xmath186 then , for @xmath187 , and @xmath188 we find , @xmath189    similarly , in the region @xmath190 , for @xmath191 we find , @xmath192 and , therefore , all these shells are stable under `` single particle evaporation '' , in total agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "a related problem is that of the dynamical stability of the shell as a whole , as was also analyzed in @xcite .",
    "there , the shells considered where `` thin '' , and therefore , the motion was described by ordinary differential equations for the shell radius @xmath137 as a function , e.g. , of proper time on the shell , which allowed for a significant simplification of the treatment of the small departures from the equilibrium configurations .",
    "unfortunately , the corresponding equations of motion for the shells considered here would be considerably more complicated and their analysis completely outside the scope of the present research . we , nevertheless , expect that such treatment , if appropriately carried out , would also agree with the results found in @xcite as the `` thin shell '' limit is approached .",

    "we shall assume from now on that @xmath222 . since , using the same arguments as in the single shell case , the shells have finite extension , it follows that one of the shells will be completely contained in the other .    in the next section we display some numerical results , both for thick shells that overlap partially , and for shells approaching the thin shell limit .",
    "we again find that the limit is associated to large values of the @xmath212 , and that the parameters describing the shells approach the thin shell values found in @xcite .",
    "as a first example we take @xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 , and @xmath165 .",
    "we also set @xmath226 , for simplicity .",
    "then , from ( [ twodos6 ] ) , we set @xmath227 , @xmath228 . finally , we choose @xmath229 , @xmath230 , and carry out the numerical integration .",
    "the results obtained indicate that the particles with @xmath223 are contained in the region @xmath231 , while for @xmath232 the corresponding range is @xmath233 . the resulting value of the external mass in @xmath234 . in figure 4",
    "we display the total density @xmath57 as a function of @xmath28 ( solid curve ) , as well as the contributions @xmath205 and @xmath206 to the density from the particles with respectively @xmath223 ( dashed curve ) and with @xmath224 ( dotted curve ) .    as an illustration of the approach to the thin shell configuration we considered again the previous values",
    "@xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath165 , @xmath226 , but choose @xmath235 , @xmath236 , and carried out the numerical integration .",
    "figure 5 displays the functions @xmath237 ( solid curve ) , @xmath238 ( dashed curve ) , and @xmath239 ( dotted curve ) .",
    "we see that now the shell extends only to the region @xmath240 , i.e. , its thickness is less than one percent of its radius . the mass , on the other hand , increases by roughly a factor of two , since @xmath241",
    ".    we may compare these results with those of the thin shell limit of @xcite as follows .",
    "it can be seen from ( 29 ) and ( 31 ) in @xcite that for a thin shell of radius @xmath137 , inner mass @xmath92 and outer mass @xmath101 , with two components with angular momenta @xmath207 , and @xmath208 , the ratio of the contributions of each component to the total mass is given by , @xmath242 where @xmath138 is given by ( [ five1 ] ) .",
    "the numerical integration gives @xmath243 , @xmath244 . if now take @xmath166 , and solve ( [ ratio1 ] ) for @xmath138 we find , @xmath245 , while replacement in ( [ five1 ] ) gives @xmath246 , which we consider as a good agreement , with a discrepancy of the order of the ratio of thickness to radius .",
    "the general conclusion from this work is that one can effectively construct a wide variety of models satisfying the restriction that @xmath0 takes only a finite set of values , and that they do seem to contain the models used in @xcite as appropriate thin shell limits .",
    "we remark also that the starting point for our construction is a variant of the ansatz used in @xcite , where @xmath1 is factored in an @xmath26 ( the particle energy ) and an @xmath0 dependent terms .",
    "the possibility of multi - peaked structure in the case of more than one value of @xmath0 obtained here is also in correspondence with the general results obtained in @xcite .",
