    "locally disordered ferroelectrics , such as @xmath1pbmg@xmath2nb@xmath3o@xmath4pbtio@xmath0 ( pmn - pt @xcite ) , ktao@xmath0:li _ etc .",
    "_ , exhibit unusual properties , which find wide applications . @xcite for example , pmn - pt crystals from the morphotropic phase boundary ( mpb ) compositional range possess an extremely high piezoelectric coefficient , which is important to transform electric energy to mechanical and back .",
    "@xcite    the high dielectric permittivity , @xmath5 , and its nonlinearity , i.e. strong voltage dependence of permittivity , makes disordered ferroelectrics very attractive for applications in electrically tunable devices , especially in thin - film form . in these and many other applications ( e.g. electrooptic and electrostriction ) ,",
    "disordered ferroelectrics are subjects to high levels of _ dc _ biases ( @xmath6 ) . in the framework of landau theory ,",
    "@xmath7   in cubic crystals is quadratic , at small fields , and only even terms are allowed .",
    "@xcite    it was shown @xcite that the giant piezoelectric response in batio@xmath0   and pmn - nt is due to `` _ _ polarization rotation _ _ '' , which means that the electric field turns the direction of polarization and produces mechanical stresses .",
    "it is important that the potential relief in pmn - pt compositions near the mpb is nearly flat , which allows large strains at comparatively small fields .",
    "these materials have some degree of local disorder that is known to produce polar regions of finite sizes .",
    "the rotation of dipole moments in these regions as well as sideway domain wall movements ( or the domain wall movements in 90@xmath8   domains ) can contribute to dielectric permittivity in a special way ( which we will discuss below ) , especially , when the field - cooled ( fc ) procedure is employed ( this helps overcoming barriers within the measuring time ) .",
    "another model example considering local dipoles is ktao@xmath0:li ( klt ) .",
    "li in klt is a dipole centre with a large li - related dipole moment .",
    "@xcite electric field aligns these dipoles and creates polarization in the direction of the field .",
    "@xcite if one changes the direction of the field in the fc mode then the direction of polarization also changes .",
    "that is , the polarization direction follows the direction of the field that should be if the gibbs statistics works .",
    "each of the li dipoles has some potential barrier , which should be overcome that produces viscosity . in ferroelectric phases of pmn - pt",
    ", some viscosity can arise also because of domain wall movements , as well as because of random fields .",
    "the application of the fc procedure allows overcoming this viscosity .",
    "the ability of an idealized dipole ( polarization ) to rotate ( without having anisotropy ) implies that this dipole has a transverse instability .",
    "indeed , the application of small fields in the transverse direction results in a huge ( ideally infinite ) response .",
    "@xcite random fields , anisotropy , and barriers suppress this effect at small external fields but some features of the transverse instability can be seen at larger fields .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we present experiments on locally disordered ferroelectrics , pmn - pt .",
    "we will show that dielectric stiffness ( inverse dielectric permittivity ) , in ferroelectric phases of pmn - pt , behaves pseudolinearly with the field , above a certain threshold .",
    "this behavior does not follow the landau theory for cubic crystals .",
    "@xcite the suggested in the present paper theoretical description of this effect takes into account third - power contributions to the free energy of ferroelectric phases .",
    "the microscopic origin of these contributions is discussed in detail for a model solid solution , klt , and we explain experimental data @xcite on the pseudolinear field dependence of the shg intensities in klt at small li concentrations .",
    "the pmn - pt single crystal samples used in this study were transparent plates cut from a flux grown crystals prepared at the physics research institute of the rostov state university .",
    "@xcite large faces of the samples were perpendicular to [ 100 ] direction .",
    "the sample with composition pmn - pt35 having dimensions of about @xmath9 mm@xmath10   was optically polished and annealed at 823 k for half an hour in air , in order to minimize residual stresses .",
    "platinum electrodes were sputtered on the large faces .",
    "thin ( 0.05 mm ) pt wires were attached to the electrodes by silver paste to connect the sample with the contacts of a linkam hfs91 : ts 600 hot - stage used as a sample holder .",
    "dielectric measurements were performed at the 2 k / min heating / cooling rate using a computer - controlled impedance analyzer solartron si 1260 .",
    "a blocking circuit protected the impedance analyzer for experiments under high _ dc _ bias .",
    "some details of dielectric studies of other pmn - pt crystals have been described elsewhere .",
    "@xcite though we focus mainly on the results obtained in the zero field cooling ( zf ) and field cooling ( fc ) modes , field heating ( fh ) , and zero field heating after field cooling protocols were used as well .",
    "the temperature dependences of the complex dielectric permittivity @xmath11   measured in the zf mode for both pmn and pmn - pt30 single crystals have one diffused frequency - dependent maximum at about 260 k and 400 k ( at 1 khz ) , respectively ( see for details refs . [ @xcite ] ) . in order to characterize the pmn - pt35 sample ,",
    "we show the @xmath11   curves measured in the zf mode at different frequencies ( fig.1 ) .",
    "two anomalies on the @xmath11   curve are in good agreement with those found in refs .",
    "[ @xcite ] : a diffused maximum corresponding to the cubic - to - tetragonal phase transition and an inflexion at a lower temperature , @xmath12 , corresponding to the mpb [ the transition between the tetragonal and rhombohedral ( or monoclinic , according to different data ) @xcite ] phases .",
    "the temperature @xmath13   of the @xmath11   maximum ( 435 k at 1 khz ) agrees well with the data obtained for pmn - pt crystals of similar compositions , @xcite the temperature @xmath12   ( @xmath14365 - 375 k at 1 khz ) is comparable with the data for flux - grown crystals with similar @xmath13   values , @xcite but is substantially ( 60 - 100 k ) higher than @xmath12   values , reported for pmn - pt crystals with similar @xmath13   values grown by bridgeman method .",
    "@xcite such discrepancy seems to be caused by differences in crystal s preparation technique and its origin needs additional studies .    in zf mode , a pronounced dielectric dispersion is observed below @xmath13   in pmn - pt35 and @xmath13   increases with the frequency @xmath15   of the measuring electric field .",
    "the @xmath16   dependence obeys the vogel - fulcher relation .",
    "@xcite while the value of the attempt frequency @xmath17   hz is typical for relaxors , @xcite the vogel - fulcher temperature @xmath18   is only slightly lower than @xmath13 .",
    "though dielectric dispersion decreases below @xmath19 , it remains considerable in the zf mode ( fig.1 ) . in the fc mode ,",
    "the dispersion in the tetragonal phase diminishes but , at low @xmath6 s , remains practically unchanged , close to @xmath20 .",
    "such behavior is similar to that observed in disordered pst and psn - based ceramics and crystals @xcite and seems to be due to the presence of the spontaneous ( thermally driven ) transition from relaxor to a mixed ( ferroelectric / relaxor ) phase containing both the nanoscale polar regions and macroscopic ferroelectric domains of tetragonal symmetry .",
    "both the @xmath20   and @xmath21   exhibit thermal hysteresis , in agreement with first order type reported for these phase transitions .",
    "@xcite the degree of the @xmath11   maximum diffusion evaluated using approach @xcite is about 20 k , in good agreement with the data for pmn - pt31 crystals and pmn - pt35 ceramics .",
    "@xcite    in the fc mode , the application of even a relatively small _ dc _ bias leads to substantial changes of @xmath22 .",
    "permittivity in the tetragonal phase decreases with the bias while , in the rhombohedral phase , it increases initially , but , at higher biases , begins to decrease ( fig .",
    "1 ) . as a result",
    ", the inflexion transforms into a maximum at @xmath23 363 k , in good agreement with the data for the [ 001]-oriented pmn - pt crystals from the @xmath24   compositional range .",
    "@xcite    as the _ dc _ bias increases , the main _ @xmath25_(@xmath26 maximum , at first , becomes sharper and higher but then lowers , diffuses and shifts to higher temperatures ( fig .",
    "1 ) . these changes are in good agreement with the data for the [ 001]-oriented pmn - pt crystals from the @xmath27   compositional range @xcite as well as with the data on disordered pbsc@xmath28ta@xmath29o@xmath0   ceramics .",
    "@xcite the frequency dispersion of @xmath5   and @xmath13   reduces dramatically for biases exceeding ( 0.7 - 1 ) kv / cm ( fig .",
    "1 ) . thus , at low @xmath6",
    ", the pmn - pt35 crystal exhibits a relaxor - like behavior , while , at high @xmath6 s , its properties are similar to ordinary ferroelectrics .",
    "the details of the dependence of @xmath13   and @xmath12   on @xmath6   will be a subject of a separate publication ; here we focus on the field dependences of dielectric stiffness .",
    "the main new result , which we want to discuss in the present paper , is the pseudolinear field dependence of dielectric stiffness in the ferroelectric phases of pmn - pt35 above a certain threshold ( fig .",
    "such behavior is not unique . for comparison ,",
    "3 presents dielectric stiffness _ vs. _",
    "@xmath6   for [ 100 ] pmn - pt30 and pmn crystals .",
    "it is seen that , the pseudolinear dependence is fulfilled for these compositions as well , but above a larger threshold .",
    "at first , we want to discuss experimental data obtained for model compounds , ktao@xmath0:li .",
    "this case has been studied carefully on the basis of first - principles computations ( see @xcite and references therein ) and experiment .",
    "@xcite it was obtained that li s are off - center and have a large dipole moment .",
    "li - related dipoles ( further , li - dipoles ) can occupy 6 possible positions with equal energy . hence , each dipole can rotate ( fc protocol is assumed ) .",
    "let a dipole occupy a position along @xmath30 .",
    "the application of field @xmath31   perpendicular to @xmath30   rotates the dipole .",
    "the change of polarization can be expressed as :    @xmath32    where @xmath33   is the li concentration , @xmath34   the dipole moment , @xmath6   the magnitude of the field along axis @xmath30 , and @xmath35 the transverse susceptibility : @xmath35 diverges in this simplified approach , @xcite but taking into account the random fields and anisotropy of the potential relief stabilizes the system .",
    "@xcite    the change of the polarization magnitude in the field can be described by the landau theory based on the soft mode concept , which we will discuss below .",
    "the free energy necessary for the description of the transverse fluctuations has the form @xcite",
    "@xmath36 } dv\\ ] ]    where @xmath37   is constant .",
    "one can obtain the longitudinal susceptibility from relations between the transverse and longitudinal changes of polarization @xcite :    @xmath38    notice that this susceptibility is due to transverse fluctuations of polarization .",
    "normally , it should be added to the langevin susceptibility that will be discussed below .",
    "the integral of this equation gives @xcite    @xmath39    where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the fc polarization magnitude at small @xmath6 ( remnant polarization ) .",
    "random fields modify this equation of state .",
    "@xcite it was obtained that equation ( [ eq4 ] ) is true for the field magnitude , which is larger than the random - field magnitude .",
    "it is important to say that equation ( [ eq4 ] ) corresponds to a cubic contribution to free energy @xcite :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 .    notice , that the same conclusions can be got under assumption of domain wall contributions to dielectric permittivity .",
    "experimentally , for dielectrics , some violations of landau expansion over the even terms ( valid for the paraelectric phase only ) were discussed for plzt by j - l .",
    "delis @xcite ; the author @xcite connected this with domain wall contributions .",
    "the evidence of equation ( [ eq4 ] ) in dielectrics was found in experiments on shg @xcite ( in magnetic systems it was discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "the shg intensity , @xmath44 , is proportional to the average square of polarization :    @xmath45    it gives the linear dependence of the fc shg intensity on @xmath6   at @xmath46 .",
    "this finding is in agreement with the shg experiment performed for klt at li concentration 1.6% ( klt 1.6% ) , in the fc mode ( see fig .",
    "the above consideration is true if only the lattice ( soft mode ) contribution to polarization is comparatively negligible .",
    "experiments on klt @xcite showed that the lattice ( soft mode ) contribution to shg intensity starts at much larger fields than those used in experiment .",
    "@xcite in some other cases , the contribution of the soft mode may be comparable with the contribution of local dipoles , polar regions or domain walls .",
    "we think that this is the case in pmn - pt35 . due to low symmetry of ferroelectric phases ( we are talking about the phases obtained in the fc mode at @xmath47 , free energy includes an odd term :    @xmath48    the equilibrium condition gives    @xmath49",
    "now one can obtain that    @xmath50    at small fields , @xmath51   that leads to the observed linear field dependence of inverse susceptibility @xcite :    @xmath52    at large fields , one needs to add even terms , and the dependence becomes quadratic and , then , @xmath53   as it should be in the landau theory developed for cubic crystals .",
    "the interval of the fields , where ( [ eq10 ] ) is true , depends on the coefficients in expansion ( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "one can expect this effect close to the phase transition temperature , and at large @xmath54 , which is possible when the transverse spatial fluctuations of polarization are large .",
    "both conditions are satisfied at mpb .      the influence of random fields on hydrodynamic fluctuations of polarization results in the insensitivity of dielectric permittivity to external fields at small fields .",
    "@xcite here we will discuss another aspect of this problem .",
    "experiment shows that , in the ferroelectric phases of pmn - pt35 , dielectric stiffness pseudolinearly depends on the field in a wide interval of the field . only at very small fields , where , perhaps , the time of measuring is not enough , there are some deviations from the pseudolinear dependence ( fig .",
    "experimental results obtained for pure pmn @xcite show a more pronounced influence of the random fields on dielectric stiffness .",
    "it was found that , in the [ 111 ] direction , dielectric stiffness of pmn has a bump while , in the [ 001 ] direction , dielectric stiffness decreases with the field smoothly .",
    "we suggest considering this difference as a result of anisotropy of free energy .",
    "we take into account that there is a diffuse first order phase transition in the [ 111 ] field .",
    "@xcite    we consider the free energy in [ 111 ] direction corresponding to the first - order phase transition between the cubic and rhombohedral phases :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is random field . from the equilibrium condition , one gets :    @xmath58    dielectric permittivity can be found by differentiating ( [ eq12 ] ) :    @xmath59    in the case @xmath57 = 0 , polarization experiences a jump at some field e@xmath60 , and dielectric permittivity diverges at this field . due to the random fields and distribution of @xmath61 s , this jump diffuses .",
    "@xcite this can be described by introducing a distribution function @xmath62,@xmath63 ( see the way how to determine the distribution function from experiment in ref .",
    "@xmath64    in order to simplify this complex situation , one can model inhomogeneous matter by introducing a gauss type distribution of @xmath65 :    @xmath66 ^ 2}de_0 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath67 is the position of the dielectric permittivity maximum , _",
    "@xmath68(x ) _ is a step function , @xmath69 is the width of the distribution function , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are continuous functions .",
    "dielectric permittivity can be got by differentiating ( [ eq15 ] ) :    @xmath72 + \\nonumber \\\\ & & + p_2 \\left ( e \\right ) e^{-[(e - e_1)/x_0]^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here erf@xmath73   is the probability integral , @xmath74 and @xmath75 can be expressed over the derivatives of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "5 shows the result of the fitting of our expression to experiment .",
    "the distribution function width was found at 1.97 kv / cm , and @xmath76 = 4.27 kv / cm .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we took @xmath74 and @xmath75 as constants , and @xmath77 was proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "the fit shows that the nature of the bump in the dependence of dielectric permittivity on the [ 111 ] field can be the diffuse anomaly due to the first order phase transition between the cubic and rhombohedral phases .",
    "the performed experiment reveals that dielectric stiffness in the ferroelectric phases of pmn - pt from the mpb range behaves linearly with @xmath6 . by integrating ( [ eq10 ] )",
    "we obtained that the dependence of polarization on @xmath6 is logarithmic .",
    "this dependence includes both even and odd terms although , in the paraelectric phase only even terms are expected . in ferroelectric phases ,",
    "the odd terms are allowed due to extrinsic contributions .",
    "@xcite notice that the paraelectric phase can be a result of zf procedure .",
    "cooling the same sample at finite @xmath6 can result in the appearance of remnant polarization .",
    "our experiments have shown that the pseudolinear field dependence of dielectric stiffness is well observed at temperatures near the mpb ( where an intermediate monoclinic phase can appear stimulating the polarization rotation @xcite ) , but , in the paraelectric phase , the data are not that definite . thus the important feature for the observation of the linearization of dielectric stiffness _ vs _",
    "@xmath6 is a flat enough potential relief , which is indeed the case in pmn - pt compositions from the mpb range .",
    "note , that in the pmn - pt30 crystal , which is outside of the morphotropic phase boundary region and especially in pure pmn , the pseudolinear portion of the 1/_@xmath78(e ) _ dependence is observed at larger fields than in pmn - pt35 .",
    "this is consistent with theory , @xcite which showed that the onset of the unusual power law in the hydrodynamic model is at the fields , which are larger then the random field magnitude . in that study",
    "only the cubic term was considered in the free energy . in the present study",
    "we have added the normal quadratic term responsible for the polarization of lattice ( soft - mode contribution ) .",
    "we have shown that these two terms together result in the pseudolinear field - dependence of nonlinear permittivity .",
    "our finding correlates with the recent observation of the linear field dependence of dielectric stiffness in thin films of pmn where the energy barriers between metastable states of polar clusters appear smaller than in bulk and ceramics .",
    "@xcite approximately linear dependences of dielectric stiffness on _ dc _ bias were observed in disordered pst ceramics near the border of stability of relaxor _ vs _ ferroelectric phase .",
    "@xcite    at small @xmath41 , the expression obtained for dilute klt provides the uncommon equation of state , @xmath79 , which resembles that obtained for some magnets .",
    "@xcite this behavior has been evidenced in experiments on shg in ktao@xmath0:li for the li concentrations 1.6% @xcite ( fig .",
    "4 ) , which , in our opinion , reflects the fact of strong transversal spatial fluctuations of polarization .",
    "if the zf procedure were employed then one would not expect such an effect at low t due to the nonergodicity in this system arising because of potential barriers ( viscosity ) .",
    "in such experiments only the ordinary , langevin type , response of the dipoles should be seen . however ,",
    "if , due to different reasons , a tilt of the li dipoles is prevented by internal random electric fields or stresses then the fluctuations become weak and the corresponding contribution to the susceptibility vanishes . for example , for the concentrations larger than 2% , the shg intensity behaves with the field exponentially , @xmath80 $ ] ( fig .",
    "4 , notice the logarithmic scale ) .",
    "it can be connected with the fact that the li dipoles are merged into large clusters or even domains at these concentrations . a strong li ",
    "li interaction prevents their reorientation .",
    "it implies that there is energy , @xmath81 , which is necessary to reorient dipoles .",
    "the electric field applied decreases this energy linearly .",
    "such dependence can be seen even for low li concentrations if the sample is strained",
    ". there can be also some differences due to different protocol in the fc procedure ( for instance , due to different annealing temperatures ) .",
    "finally , we have observed a pseudolinear field dependence of dielectric stiffness in [ 100 ] pmn , pmn - pt35 and pmn - pt30 single crystals in the fc mode .",
    "we have explained this dependence by polarization fluctuations ( rotations ) and domain wall movements .",
    "@xcite within the same approach we managed to explain the experimental data @xcite on the pseudolinear dependence of the shg intensities on @xmath6 in klt at small li concentrations .",
