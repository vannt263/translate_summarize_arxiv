    "the study of random fluctuations has a relevant role in many branches of physics  @xcite .",
    "close to equilibrium , fluctuations are intimately connected with dissipative relaxation mechanisms according to the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , independently of the physical origin of the fluctuations , classical or quantum - mechanical  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , far from equilibrium fluctuating quantities provide a unique insight into the internal properties of the system under consideration  @xcite .",
    "an immediate example is the evaluation of the quasi - particle charge of carriers through measurements of the current cumulants  @xcite .",
    "many important phenomena can be characterized in terms of counted , elementary entities .",
    "the concept of particles , in the quantum realm , naturally defines what quantities should be counted . from this point of view",
    "one recognizes that counting problems constitute a quite general framework in which many different dynamical processes can be interpreted , also in the presence of complex quantum physics .",
    "the first application of the counting approach in quantum physics came from photon counting experiments , where the concept of full counting statistics ( fcs ) was originally developed  @xcite . recently , this concept has attracted intensive theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite attention within the field of electron transport . in the context of mesoscopic transport , fcs was introduced in order to characterize the noise properties of nanodevices  @xcite .",
    "later , it was demonstrated also to be a sensitive diagnostic tool for detecting quantum - mechanical coherence , entanglement , disorder , and dissipation  @xcite .",
    "mathematically , fcs encodes the complete knowledge of the probability distribution @xmath1 of the number @xmath2 of transmitted entities during the measurement time @xmath3 or , equivalently , of all corresponding cumulants .",
    "the study of counting statistics for stochastic processes is generally of broad relevance for a wide class of problems .",
    "for example , non - zero higher order cumulants describe non - gaussian behavior and contain information about rare events , whose study has become an important topic within non - equilibrium statistics in physics , chemistry , and biology @xcite . within the framework of master equations",
    "some important results were recently obtained .",
    "bagrets and nazarov  @xcite have shown that the cumulant generating function ( cgf ) corresponding to a markovian master equation is determined by the dominating eigenvalue of the rate matrix , when counting fields are appropriately included .",
    "some of us have shown that it in principle is possible to calculate arbitrary orders of cumulants using perturbation theory in the counting field , rather than solving the full eigenvalue problem for the dominating eigenvalue @xcite . for non - markovian systems described by generalized master equations ( gme )",
    ", we have shown that the cgf scales linearly with time @xcite , as in the case of markovian processes , if the memory kernel has no power - law tails . moreover",
    ", the cgf can be calculated using a so - called non - markovian expansion @xcite .",
    "recently , we developed a method which unifies and extends these earlier approaches to fcs within a gme formulation @xcite .",
    "due to their intrinsic analytic structures , the previous approaches were in practice limited to systems with only a few states @xcite , or only the first few current cumulants could be addressed @xcite .",
    "in contrast , this recent advancement enables studies of a much larger class of problems , including the evaluation of zero - frequency current cumulants of very high orders for non - markovian systems with many states  @xcite .",
    "we also showed how the method allows calculations of the finite - frequency current noise for non - markovian transport processes @xcite .",
    "a detailed account of these techniques will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in this paper we mainly want to restate the essential findings and address the open questions of relevance in future research .    in order to demonstrate the applicability of our methods , we consider the current fluctuations of charge transport through a coherently coupled double quantum dot , a charge qubit .",
    "we consider the effects of a nearby quantum point contact ( qpc ) charge detector and the coupling to a dissipative phonon bath . if the qpc barrier height is modulated by electrons on the double quantum dot , the fluctuations of the current through the qpc monitors the dynamics of the qubit .",
    "this introduces a qubit dephasing mechanism .",
    "as we shall see , current fluctuations can be useful for extracting information about the internal dynamics of the double dot system .",
    "we concentrate on the transition between coherent and incoherent transport through the qubit , demonstrating the sensitivity of the cumulants to this transition .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : nmgme ] we summarize the general concepts of our method , while clearly identifying the essential steps to obtain the fcs or the current cumulants for a system governed by a non - markovian gme .",
    "we briefly sketch the derivation of the expressions for the first few current cumulants ( current , noise , and skewness ) used in the following section . in section [ sec : model ] we describe the model of a dissipative qubit with a nearby qpc charge detector and show how the current cumulants yield information about the dynamics of the qubit . in section [ sec : open ] we discuss various open questions and give an outlook for future research .",
    "for many nanoscopic systems it is convenient to consider the evolution of only a few degrees of freedom . the system evolution",
    "is then captured by the dynamic equation for the reduced density matrix corresponding to these degrees of freedom .",
    "this equation should contain the effects of all external forces driving the system and , at the same time , the effective dynamics due to the degrees of freedom that have been traced out .",
    "the dynamics of the reduced system is , in general , non - markovian , and can for a large class of processes be described by a generic non - markovian gme of the form @xcite @xmath4 here , the reduced density matrix @xmath5 of the system has been resolved with respect to the number of transferred charges @xmath2 .",
    "the memory kernel @xmath6 describes the influence of the environment on the dynamics of the system , while the inhomogeneity @xmath7 accounts for initial correlations between system and environment . for a given system , the derivation of an equation like eq .",
    "( [ eq : gme ] ) may be a difficult task , but many different examples can already be found in the literature @xcite . both @xmath6 and @xmath7 decay with time , usually on a comparable timescale .",
    "we consider systems where @xmath6 and @xmath7 with time decay faster than any power - law . with this condition",
    "it can be shown that the effects of the inhomogeneity vanish in the long - time limit .",
    "the inhomogeneity @xmath7 is consequently irrelevant for all statistical quantities in the long - time limit . for finite times , it may , however , play a crucial role @xcite .    the cumulant generating function @xmath8 corresponding to @xmath1",
    "is defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the so - called counting field .",
    "the second equality defines @xmath1 as the trace of the @xmath2-resolved reduced density matrix .",
    "the @xmath11th cumulant @xmath12 is directly connected to the taylor coefficients of the cgf in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cgf ] ) according to the definition @xmath13 .",
    "we now derive a general expression for the cgf of a system described by a gme of the form given in eq.([eq : gme ] ) . in laplace space , defined by the transform @xmath14",
    ", the equation has the algebraic form @xmath15 which can formally be solved for @xmath16 by introducing the resolvent @xmath17^{-1}$ ] .",

    "this expression constitutes a powerful formal result , but as we shall see in the following , it also leads to useful practical schemes .",
    "as already mentioned above , the cgf scales linearly with time in the long - time limit for kernels that decay faster than any power - law and is independent of the initial conditions @xcite . for such systems we can define the zero - frequency cumulants of the current as @xmath20 ( with @xmath21 in the following ) . with the counting field @xmath10 set to zero",
    ", the system tends exponentially to a unique stationary state determined by the @xmath22 pole of the resolvent @xmath23 .",
    "the stationary state is given by the eigenvector corresponding to the zero - eigenvalue of @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the normalized solution to @xmath27 .",
    "with finite values of @xmath10 , an eigenvalue @xmath28 develops adiabatically from the zero - eigenvalue and the long - time behavior is still determined by the pole @xmath29 $ ] of @xmath30 close to zero . the particular pole @xmath31 that solves the self - consistency equation @xmath32 and goes to zero with @xmath10 going to zero , i.e. , @xmath33 , consequently determines the long - time limit of the cgf .",
    "we thus find @xmath34 for large @xmath3 , where @xmath35 is a time - independent function depending on the initial conditions .",
    "the current cumulants then read @xmath36 .",
    "in the markovian limit for the kernel @xmath37 we obtain @xmath38 , consistently with previous results for the markovian case @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : self - consistency ] ) , it is clear that calculations of current cumulants proceed in two steps : first , the dominating eigenvalue @xmath28 has to be determined . secondly , the self - consistency equation must be solved for @xmath31 .    in the original approach to calculations of cgf for non - markovian transport systems a so - called non - markovian expansion was developed @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the cgf is expressed as a series using only the taylor expansion of the dominating eigenvalue around @xmath39 .",
    "mathematically , the non - markovian expansion is equivalent to the solution of the self - consistency equation .",
    "the method , however , requires an analytic solution for the dominating eigenvalue with its full dependence on the counting field @xcite .",
    "this is not a feasible approach , when the involved matrices are large or , equivalently , for systems with many degrees of freedom .",
    "however , if we are only interested in a finite number of cumulants an alternative route exists . to this end",
    ", we have developed a scheme for calculating finite orders of current cumulants , where both the eigenvalue problem and the self - consistency equation are solved using perturbation theory in the counting field .",
    "a particular strength of the scheme is that it is recursive , allowing for calculations of cumulants of very high orders @xcite . here",
    ", we do not present all details of the derivation of the recursive scheme , but mainly focus on the final results for the first three current cumulants ; mean current , noise , and skewness .",
    "we consider an expansion of the dominating eigenvalue in @xmath10 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "let us first suppose that the coefficients @xmath42 are known .",
    "this allows us to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : self - consistency ] ) for @xmath31 to a given order in @xmath10 . from the expansion @xmath43",
    ", we then extract the zero - frequency cumulants of the current .",
    "the results for the lowest cumulants are @xmath44 .",
    "\\label{eq : iii}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] higher - order cumulants are readily calculated in a recursive manner @xcite .",
    "the cumulants consist of contributions from the purely markovian quantities @xmath45 and the non - markovian terms @xmath42 for @xmath46 .",
    "we observe the general rule that the @xmath2th cumulant requires knowledge of non - markovian terms @xmath42 of order @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "consequently , the mean current is not sensitive to non - markovian effects , whereas higher - order cumulants are . in general , the distinction made here between markovian and non - markovian systems is related to the existence of a finite memory in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gme ] ) . in practice ,",
    "the memory effects depend on the choice of degrees of freedom that are traced out .",
    "it may for example be convenient to trace out degrees of freedom of a markovian system and describe the resulting , reduced system by a non - markovian gme as it was done in ref .",
    "of course , in such cases our method yields identical results regardless of the particular formulation , markovian or non - markovian .    we still need to calculate the expansion coefficients @xmath42 entering the expression @xmath41 .",
    "the eigenvalue problem for @xmath28 is defined by the equation @xmath48|0(\\chi , z){\\rangle\\!\\rangle}= \\lambda_0(\\chi , z)|0(\\chi , z){\\rangle\\!\\rangle},\\ ] ] where we have written @xmath49 as the sum of an unperturbed part @xmath50 and the perturbation @xmath51 .",
    "the right eigenvector @xmath52 reduces adiabatically to the stationary state @xmath26 with @xmath10 and @xmath40 going to zero and satisfies the normalization condition @xmath53 . here",

    "using rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory we can express the coefficients in terms of the taylor coefficients of @xmath56 denoted as @xmath57 , i.e. , @xmath58 with @xmath59 by definition , and the pseudoinverse of the kernel @xmath60 defined as @xmath61 .",
    "even if @xmath50 is singular , the pseudoinverse is in fact well - defined since the singular part of the kernel is projected away by the projector @xmath62 .",
    "we can now calculate the expansion coefficients and we report here the resulting expressions for a few of them @xmath63 the expansion coefficients can also be calculated in a recursive manner as described in refs .",
    "we note that the recursive scheme can be used both for analytic and numerical calculations .",
    "evaluation of the pseudoinverse @xmath64 amounts to solving matrix equations which is feasible even with very large matrices @xcite .",
    "numerically , the scheme is stable for very high orders of cumulants ( @xmath65 ) as we have tested on simple examples .",

    "the dotted line shows the effect of the dephasing due to the qpc charge detector , without any contributions from the boson bath ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "for @xmath199 , the peak width is given by the total dephasing rate , i.e. , the sum of the intrinsic contribution @xmath127 and the contribution from the qpc @xmath200 .",
    "the width is thus larger than in the coherent case .",
    "the peak , however , remains symmetric .",
    "the gray curves show the mean current , when the double dot is coupled to the heat bath at finite temperature , but with the qpc charge detector not detecting the position of an electron on the double dot ( @xmath201 ) .",
    "the two gray lines correspond to the two different decouplings , decoupling i ) with light gray and decoupling ii ) with dark gray .",
    "we note that the curve corresponding to decoupling ii ) is asymmetric around @xmath198 .",
    "finally , the dot - dashed curve corresponds to the mean current with contributions to the dephasing from both the qpc and the heat bath .     as a function of the level detuning @xmath67 .",
    "b ) normalized skewness @xmath202 vs @xmath67 .",
    "parameters corresponding to the different line styles are given in the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] . ]",
    "while the mean current studied so far only reveals little information about the dephasing mechanisms , we expect more information to be contained in the higher - order cumulants . in fig .",
    "[ fig : noiseskew ] we show the fano factor @xmath203 and the normalized skewness @xmath204 as functions of the level detuning @xmath80 .",
    "line styles and parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : model]b . generally , we observe that the two cumulants to a higher degree than the mean current discriminate between various regimes . in particular , the coherent regime has strongly super - poissonian behavior with both of the normalized cumulants reaching values larger than the poissonian limit of @xmath205 .",
    "in contrast , for the sequential tunneling regime , given by the markovian contributions to the cumulants , only sub - poissonian behavior is observed @xcite .",
    "if a dephasing mechanism is introduced , either due to the qpc charge detector or the heat bath , the super - poissonian behavior is gradually reduced towards the sequential tunneling regime with increasing dephasing rate .",
    "the dephasing rate @xmath196 due to the qpc can be modified via the coupling between the charge qubit and the qpc . on the other hand , the dephasing induced by the heat bath changes with the bath temperature , which can also induce the transition between coherent and incoherent transport . such a transition was recently observed in shot noise measurements of transport through a double dot at low temperatures @xcite . comparing the scales of the vertical axes of the second and third cumulants in fig .",
    "[ fig : noiseskew ] , we conjecture that such a transition may be better visible in the third cumulant and that even higher order cumulants in general could be more sensitive to such a transition .",
    "we now study , how the symmetry of the cumulants changes in the various regimes . without coupling to the qpc or the heat bath",
    "the cumulant are symmetric around @xmath198 . in case",
    "the qubit is coupled only to the qpc , this symmetry remains intact .",
    "however , with non - zero coupling to the heat bath , asymmetry around @xmath198 is observed ( see dark gray and dot - dashed lines ) .",
    "the asymmetry occurs due to the asymmetry in emission and absorption of bosons at low temperatures .",
    "phonon absorption and emission dominate for @xmath206 and @xmath207 , respectively .",
    "we note that the curves obtained using decoupling i ) do not capture this essential physics , not even to first order in @xmath186 .",
    "indeed , in all the regimes for which the cumulants are symmetric , the rates have the property @xmath208 .",
    "this particular property is not fulfilled in decoupling ii ) due to the imaginary part of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wdiss ] ) , and we believe that decoupling ii ) should be correct to any order in @xmath186 .",
    "what is then the essential difference between the dephasing induced by the qpc charge detector and the bath - induced dephasing in the model we are considering here ?",
    "the qpc charge detector induces dephasing with little influence on the dynamics of the system and does not destroy the symmetry in the coherent regime .",
    "in contrast , the bath - induced dephasing is generated with emission and absorption of bosons , and the charge qubit is influenced by the intrinsic asymmetry of this process .",
    "we conclude the analysis of this model for now and postpone a further analysis to future research aimed at an improved understanding of these dephasing mechanisms .",
    "we have shown how it is now possible to calculate cumulants , also of high orders , for a wide class of counting problems . in this work",
    "we have applied the method to investigate how the dephasing mechanism of a qpc charge detector differs from that of an external heat bath .",
    "the method is , however , applicable to a large class of non - markovian counting problems , also from outside the field of physics .",
    "the general approach outlined here is also suitable for calculations of the finite frequency noise spectrum @xcite .",
    "it is relevant to ask if it is possible to extend this approach to frequency dependent cumulants of higher orders , similar to the results already obtained for markovian systems @xcite ?",
    "another interesting issue concerns systems with very long memory time ( for example , levy - flight processes ) .",
    "such cases would require us to reconsider some of the assumptions underlying the theory presented here .",
    "we would like to thank r.  aguado , t.  brandes , a .- p .",
