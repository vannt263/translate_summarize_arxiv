    "qualitative understanding in physics usually comes from the same calculations which give quantitative knowledge , but in the case of special relativity this connection is weakened .",
    "lorentz invariance enables computation of many results with little or no consideration of microscopic details , hence there is usually no practical benefit ( and often great difficulty ) in analyzing a given scenario in more detail .",
    "complete reliance on lorentz invariance can , nevertheless , leave the uncomfortable sensation of a gap in understanding .",
    "generally one expects concrete effects to have concrete causes , yet in relativity one finds very concrete - sounding effects ( slowing clocks , shortening objects ) whose cause is variously attributed to an abstract principle ( invariance of the speed of light ) or to an abstract entity ( spacetime ) or to conventions ( how things are measured , how simultaneity is defined ) .",
    "we do nt claim that these explanations are incorrect but it seems reasonable to look also for more ordinary physical explanations and try to understand how they connect to the abstract notions .",
    "adding to the sense of abstraction in special relativity is the lack of straightforward experimental demonstration for some of the central phenomena .",
    "time dilation has long been observed directly in experiments using moving clocks,@xcite and mass / energy equivalence has been similarly verified,@xcite but length contraction and the synchronization discrepancy for separated clocks are more challenging . for",
    "these effects one must appeal to indirect observations ( e.g. , the michelson - morley negative result ) and the overall consistency of the framework .",
    "the `` dynamical '' approach to relativity aims to shrink these gaps by tracing relativistic effects to their underlying physical mechanisms , at least qualitatively .",
    "this helps to flesh out the abstract arguments and makes the hard - to - demonstrate effects more believable by showing that they have straightforward causes rooted in familiar physics .",
    "we emphasize that seeking mechanistic accounts for relativistic effects does not mean postulating a preferred reference frame or medium .",
    "the point is rather that one can , in principle , compute any relativistic quantity ( e.g. , the size of a moving molecule ) directly from the underlying theories of matter without invoking relativity at all . in practice",
    "this is very difficult but a mechanistic analysis still helps to show qualitatively how the effects arise .",
    "the mechanisms most relevant to relativity are those of waves and fields .",
    "relativity developed simultaneously with electromagnetism , the first fundamental theory based on fields and waves , and this paradigm now extends to all known matter ( in the `` standard model '' of particle physics ) .",
    "many relativistic phenomena that at first seem strange or opaque become quite natural when viewed in a field / wave context .",
    "it is worth noting that many elements of the dynamical viewpoint pre - date relativity . indeed",
    ", many relativistic phenomena were first discovered through dynamical considerations , starting over two decades before einstein s work .",
    "fitzgerald , lorentz , larmor , and thompson were all motivated by dynamics in introducing the seminal notions of length contraction , time dilation , and relativistic mass.@xcite    following einstein and minkowski the dynamical view languished , displaced by the principle - based treatment that was more efficient and also did not require a microscopic understanding of matter , which was not available at that time .",
    "the viewpoint was revived by j.s .",
    "bell in his 1976 essay `` how to teach special relativity , '' @xcite which , however , had little impact on pedagogy , possibly because it proposed rather opaque numerical computations . in the 1990 s",
    "the baton was picked up by h.r .",
    "brown , often in collaboration with o. pooley , who mounted a vigorous philosophical defense of bell s viewpoint and extended it to cover general relativity as well.@xcite fully constructive examples have been presented by d.j .",
    "miller , who also makes the suggestion , correct in our view , that the primary aim of the dynamical approach should be to supplement the customary one with increased qualitative understanding.@xcite the dynamical viewpoint has also been presented to laypeople , somewhat briefly by n. d. mermin,@xcite and more fully by the present author.@xcite    the main aim in what follows is to catalog and illustrate some of the principle mechanisms that underlie relativistic phenomena .",
    "our focus is narrower than that of brown and pooley in that we do not discuss general relativity nor ( in any detail ) the historical development of the theories ; also , we have tried to avoid taking positions on philosophical questions such as the primacy of spacetime .",
    "our approach differs from that of miller ( and bell ) in that we do not attempt a full constructive derivation but instead emphasize qualitative behavior .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : motive ] describes in more detail what the dynamical view means , at least in the approach taken here .",
    "section  [ sec : mechanism ] enumerates mechanisms that give rise to relativistic effects and shows models to demonstrate them .",
    "section  [ sec : frames ] discusses further how mechanistic explanations connect to the more customary approach , and sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] provides a brief conclusion .",
    "the dynamical viewpoint aims to connect the phenomena of relativity to underlying physical aspects of the universe as currently understood .",
    "the phrase `` underlying physical aspects '' could be interpreted many ways , but we mean here the generic characteristics of current state - of - the - art theories , namely field theories , _ excluding _ lorentz invariance .    in the most simplistic ( but still useful ) formulation",
    "this means starting with a stipulation that everything in the world is `` made from waves.''@xcite particles are really wave packets , and composite objects consist of wave packets moving under the influence of other fields whose effects are also transmitted by propagating waves .",
    "the main goal is then to translate generic wave and field knowledge into intuition about relativistic phenomena .",
    "taking a dynamical view it is natural to think not just about lorentz - invariant theories but also about related theories that share the same dynamical mechanisms seen in our universe .",
    "a generic change in the parameters of a lorentz - invariant field theory leads to a theory that is still a field theory , hence shares the same types of mechanisms and the same `` relativity - like '' effects , but which is no longer precisely lorentz - invariant .",
    "for example , one might alter the wave speeds of the different fields to be direction - dependent and/or unequal to each other .",
    "considering this wider context of theories helps to illuminate lorentz invariance by contrast , much as one understands rotation invariance in mechanics by considering both symmetric and non - symmetric potentials .    we certainly do not wish to suggest that either lorentz invariance or minkowski space are not fundamental ; the point is merely to provide a broader picture of where these concepts come from and why the prior newtonian picture , in which motion _ per se _ entails no real effects ,",
    "is not compatible with a world consisting of fundamental fields .",
    "we describe some of the main mechanisms giving rise to relativistic effects and show elementary models that illustrate them .",
    "although the models do sometimes produce quantitatively correct relativistic answers , the intent is never to independently prove lorentz invariance but rather to illustrate generic mechanisms that create the _ possibility _ of lorentz invariance in a world composed of fields and waves .    for the moment",
    "we take a naive view of concepts such as motion , reference frame , and measurement , defering a deeper discussion to sec .",
    "[ sec : frames ] .",
    "we will sometimes refer to relatively - moving observers as `` moving '' and `` stationary , '' however , these are meant merely as convenient labels .",
    "one immediate consequence of the field / wave paradigm is non - rigidity of objects .",
    "rigid objects can exist in newtonian theories because forces propagate at infinite speed , but in a field theory universe all forces must propagate via waves , and waves inherently move at finite speed . for everyday objects in our world , which are built from atoms , the forces binding them are of course mainly electrical and the waves electromagnetic .    but",
    "finite speed of force propagation means that all objects will deform under an applied force , simply because one part starts to move before the other parts experience any force at all .",
    "this fundamental non - rigidity is independent of the strength or organization of bonds within the object .",
    "this certainly does not prove lorentz contraction , and additional study is needed to see whether a deformation persists after the acceleration stops ( see sec .",
    "[ lcdpf ] below ) .",
    "nevertheless , the failure of rigidity does at least create the possibility of contraction.@xcite      not only do waves propagate at finite speed but wave speed is also generically independent of the motion of the source .",
    "the speed of sound waves from a jet does nt depend on the speed of the jet ; the speed of water waves in a wake does nt depend on the speed of the boat .",
    "we stress that this is _ source - independence _",
    "observer - independence _",
    ", the vastly stronger assertion that implies complete lorentz invariance .",
    "source - independence is a generic feature of wave physics , while observer - idependence is an assertion not about the waves themselves but about complex physical effects occurring within every possible apparatus that could be used to measure wave speed .",
    "source - independence of wave speeds causes changes to the tick rates of moving clocks , as demonstrated most clearly within the venerable `` light clock . ''",
    "the light clock consists of a light pulse bouncing back and forth between two mirrors , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lightclock](a ) .",
    "if we now imagine the clock placed on board a spaceship with glass walls and flown by us at high speed , it will look as in fig .",
    "[ fig : lightclock](b ) ( taking the clock to be oriented transverse to the motion of the ship ) .",
    "the light pulse now travels a longer distance for each cycle , hence the tick rate is slower .",
    "source - independence prevents the clock from making any kind of automatic adjustment to preserve its rate when moving ; source motion alters the spatial pattern of the waves ( doppler effect ) but this does not help the clock to maintain its rate .",
    "all clocks will be affected by this effect to some degree because their subcomponents can only interact through wave transmission .    in this case",
    "a simple calculation using the pythagorean theorem does give the correct lorentz time dilation factor.@xcite it should , however , be recognized that this calculation relies on additional implicit assumptions . indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig : lightclock ] could also be drawn within a non - lorentz - invariant theory having , for example , different wave speeds in different directions , and the naive calculation would then be wrong . what remains generically true , however , is that the moving clock will change its rate due to source - independence of wave speed .",
    "another possibility is that shape changes as discussed above ( and in sec .",
    "[ lcdpf ] below ) could counteract the rate change due to wave propagation .",
    "if the light clock housing were to shrink , thus reducing the vertical travel distance , then the rate could remain unchanged ; however , there is no reason to expect the effects to conspire in this way.@xcite      the relativistic mass increase @xmath0 where @xmath1 , seems ad hoc when introduced in the context of particle mechanics .",
    "it is difficult to understand why an elementary and indivisible piece of matter should become harder to accelerate when moving faster .",
    "the effect is , however , quite natural for particles viewed as wave packets , as in modern quantum theories .",
    "close analogies to such `` matter waves '' can be constructed using simple wave - on - string models , allowing the effect to be understood in a simple setting .    for simplicity",
    "we start by considering matter moving only in the @xmath2-direction .",
    "we then suppose that the matter is actually described by a wave @xmath3 obeying the standard wave equation for transverse waves on a string : @xmath4 where we have set all the constants to one for simplicity .",
    "all traveling waves in this model move with fixed speed @xmath5 regardless of frequency , hence the model corresponds to `` massless '' waves such as light . to model massive particles one needs an extra restoring force at each point",
    "this can be visualized as placing hooke s law springs on either side of the the string at frequent intervals , hence we will refer to the model as `` @xmath6 . ''",
    "the equation we will use is the continuous limit in which the restoring force acts at each point : @xmath7 here the restoring force constant is labeled as @xmath8 anticipating that @xmath9 will be the mass of a `` particle '' in this model .",
    "the massive case with @xmath10 differs qualitatively from the massless case ( @xmath11 ) in two important ways .",
    "first , the presence of the springs obstructs the waves and slows them down ( e.g. , a single spring attached to a string will reflect some fraction of incident waves ) .",
    "second , the massive waves can approximately sit still , because they can oscillate in place under the spring restoring force .",
    "the massless waves can not sit still because their only restoring force comes from neighboring parts of the string .",
    "the elementary traveling wave solutions take the usual form of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where the angular velocity @xmath14 and wavenumber @xmath15 satisfy @xmath16 these solutions extend over all space and do nt look much like particles , but this can be remedied by building a `` wave packet''a superposition of waves having wavenumbers in a narrow range , such as@xcite @xmath17 looking first at @xmath18 , we see that the waves are all in phase at @xmath19 , but they interfere increasingly destructively away from this point .",
    "this creates a localized packet having approximate location @xmath20 and approximate wavenumber @xmath21 ( and corresponding angular velocity @xmath22 ) . as @xmath23 changes , the location of the in - phase maximum moves , and with it the wave packet . by substituting @xmath24 into eq .",
    "( [ packet ] ) , and using eq .",
    "( [ omegak ] ) , one sees that the packet moves with approximate velocity given by the `` group velocity '' @xmath25 we henceforth drop the bar notation and use @xmath15 and @xmath14 for the packet s central values .",
    "the @xmath26 model is not so far from the real description of particles in modern quantum theories .",
    "the non - particle - like extended solutions do exist in nature , but they are converted to more localized wave packets through interaction with other clumps of matter ( such as measuring devices).@xcite quantization also crucially prevents the waves from dissipating away to zero .",
    "a wave packet , like a particle , can be accelerated by a potential field .",
    "for example , letting the potential be @xmath27 one can add a coupling term @xmath28 to eq .",
    "( [ m>0 ] ) ; this corresponds to letting the `` spring tension '' @xmath8 vary with position , which is essentially the action of the standard model higgs field.@xcite    the qualitative origin of relativistic mass can be seen immediately since the ( absolute value of ) group velocity satisfies @xmath29 for all values of @xmath15 .",
    "the packets can never attain the `` spring - free '' speed @xmath30 because their propagation is hindered by the springs . as the limiting speed is approached , energy applied to accelerate a packet goes instead into vibrations of the field . indeed the energy _",
    "always _ goes into field vibrations and the packet acceleration is merely a side effect that occurs for low speeds .    to see this in more detail we start with the standard expressions for energy and momentum of a vibrating string , with the hooke s law energy added:@xcite @xmath31 \\\\ \\mathcal{p } & = -\\int dx\\ , \\dot{\\xi}\\xi^\\prime . \\label{p}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the dot and prime indicate derivatives with respect to time and space . evaluating these for a wave packet that is narrow in @xmath15 space gives to good accuracy @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the squared norm:@xcite @xmath34 .    to go further in the program of constructing particles out of wave packets one has to decide what value of @xmath33 constitutes a single particle .",
    "not just any arbitrary convention will do , but it should be preserved , at a minimum , under slowly - varying ( `` adiabatic '' ) conditions . under adiabatic conditions the potential fields vary weakly in space and time , creating only small forces that change slowly .",
    "a single particle moving in such a weak field should remain as a single particle , although its amplitude @xmath33 may change .",
    "similar questions were studied in the early days of quantum mechanics and it was shown that certain quantities are invariant under adiabatic changes .",
    "the most well - known occurs in the harmonic oscillator and takes the form @xmath35.@xcite this invariant also applies to wave packets because the vibrating string is just a collection of harmonic oscillators , one for each @xmath15 , as can be seen by fourier - transforming eq .",
    "( [ m>0 ] ) in the spatial variable .    making use of eq .",
    ", we see that the wavepacket norm @xmath36 will evolve such that @xmath37 and the single - particle normalization definition should be consistent with this .",
    "we choose the simplest option , @xmath38 which is also the normalization arrived at through quantization .",
    "applying eq .",
    "( [ nomega ] ) to eqs .",
    "( [ ebar ] ) and , one finds for the single - particle energy and momentum @xmath39 which are the well - known relations proposed by einstein for photons and by de broglie for matter waves ( in units with @xmath40 ) .",
    "a force @xmath41 arising from some potential @xmath27 by definition acts to change the wave packet momentum by @xmath42 and hence from eq .",
    "( [ pbar2 ] ) @xmath43 which is exactly as expected for a force acting on the relativistic mass eq .",
    "( [ relmass ] ) , since eqs .   and",
    "imply @xmath44 and @xmath45 thus , the relativistic mass and its associated force law are embedded in the physics of a vibrating string , which also ( with many additional complications ) is the physics of the actual fields giving rise to `` particles '' in nature .",
    "we should recognize that eqs .",
    "( [ e ] ) and give a rather oversimplified description of a real string ; indeed , strictly transverse mechanical waves can not carry longitudinal momentum.@xcite eqs .",
    "( [ e ] ) and apply to small - amplitude oscillations where the string is assumed not to be stretched by the wave ( in which case the wave can not be strictly transverse ) .",
    "the momentum of a field as defined by a formula like eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) really represents energy flux , and it only becomes connected to the velocity of an object through the construction of wave packets .",
    "we note for future reference that factors of @xmath14 in wave packet expressions are directly proportional to relativistic @xmath46 factors , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ omegagamma ] ) .",
    "we note also that the results extend to packets moving in two or three dimensions by simply replacing @xmath15 with a vector @xmath47 . for two dimensions the model",
    "can still be visualized reasonably easily as a vibrating sheet .",
    "the relativistic mass effect creates a second important mechanism contributing to time dilation . as an object accelerates in one direction , the relativistic mass increase of its subcomponents results in a slowing of transverse motions within the object .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood directly in terms of wave packets .",
    "the velocity of a wave packet is its group velocity , eq .",
    "( [ gv ] ) , which depends on the overall frequency .",
    "but the frequency measures overall energy , eq .",
    "( [ ebar2 ] ) , and hence is changed by an applied force .",
    "acceleration of the wave packet in one direction increases its frequency and this reduces the group velocity of the packet in transverse directions .",
    "the different components of velocity in a wave packet are thus interrelated in a way that would seem quite unintuitive for a pure point particle .",
    "a simple example is an orbiting particle accelerated slowly perpendicular to the orbital plane ( other orbital orientations become very complex , hence bell s original suggestion to study them through numerical simulation).@xcite there is no tangential force , hence the orbital momentum @xmath48 does nt change , but since the effective mass does increase one finds that the orbital speed is reduced : @xmath49 implying @xmath50 , or @xmath51 assuming that the orbital radius ( or shape , if not circular ) stays the same,@xcite this result implies that the orbital period increases by the time dilation factor @xmath46 .",
    "this calculation was slightly oversimplified since the particle s @xmath46-factor differs from that of the overall system ; however , taking this into account leads to the same result.@xcite also we note that the slower orbit implies a reduced centripetal force , so the field providing the central force needs to behave accordingly .",
    "this is not trivial , e.g. a transverse electric field actually grows with velocity ( cf .",
    "[ fig : movingcharge ] below ) , but then a magnetic field also emerges whose lorentz force more than offsets it .",
    "a similar case is the massive analog of the light clock , namely a``bouncing ball '' clock in which a ball bounces between two plates ( with bounce direction again oriented transverse to the motion of the ship that carries the clock ) . as the ship accelerates perpendicular to the bounce directions ,",
    "the same acceleration must be applied to the ball to keep it bouncing between the two plates .",
    "the clock s caretakers on board the ship must do this without applying any force parallel to bounce directions , because that would invalidate the system s timekeeping function even as seen by themselves .",
    "hence they will maintain the clock through small impulses perpendicular to its bounce direction , leading to the same slowing effect seen with the accelerated orbit .",
    "the frequency - changing mechanisms described here and in sec .  [ wptd ] above will affect almost every type of clock , but they are certainly not an exhaustive list .",
    "most clocks will also be affected by the shape changes described in sec .",
    "[ wpr ] above and sec .",
    "[ lcdpf ] below ; some clocks will also be affected by changes in macroscopic field values , e.g. , the electric and magnetic fields within an lc circuit .",
    "length contraction  more correctly , shape deformation  first occurred to fitzgerald upon seeing heaviside s solution showing the deformed electric field about a moving charged particle ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : movingcharge]).@xcite this famous result showed that the moving electric field becomes `` compressed '' along the direction of motion , which certainly suggests that any objects constructed using such forces should undergo at least _ some _ shape change when moving .    .",
    "field lines indicate field strength on a circle about the charge center , as measured in a stationary frame .",
    ", width=321 ]    rather than reproduce this computation we note a qualitative way to understand why such changes are inevitable .",
    "the field of a moving particle establishes itself through the emission of electromagnetic waves during acceleration .",
    "these waves are doppler - shifted like any other , having a spatial pattern that is asymmetrical about the charge center .",
    "the asymmetry in wave pattern then results in an asymmetrical final field . for a scalar field",
    "this is the only effect of steady motion , but for the electromagnetic field a magnetic field is also produced .    to go further and show that the altered fields actually lead to contraction is worthwhile @xcite but we focus here on the qualitative lesson that _",
    "some _ shape change is inevitable in a field theory .",
    "indeed we assert , with harvey brown , that `` shape deformation produced by motion is far from the proverbial riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.''@xcite    another way to see the role of internal fields in length contraction is to think of how the shape of an object changes as it undergoes acceleration . for concreteness",
    "we imagine a barbell with two identical weights connected by a rod , being accelerated in the direction along the rod . as it accelerates it also contracts , so the distance between the weights decreases .",
    "hence the acceleration of the two weights is not identical ; the rear weight accelerates slightly faster than the forward one .",
    "this in turn implies that the two weights feel slightly different forces during the acceleration .",
    "what is the origin of this force difference ?",
    "it can only arise from the changing intermolecular forces within the connecting rod , which occurs due to the mechanism of fig .",
    "[ fig : movingcharge].@xcite      mass / energy equivalence implies that the electric field within a capacitor adds to its inertia ( makes the capacitor harder to accelerate ) , but how does this come about ? if one applies force to the capacitor , the force acts on the atoms forming the plates and housing , not on the electric field , so how does the electric field also contribute to the inertia ?",
    "likewise when an atom emits a photon and one electron drops to a lower energy level , the atom must become lighter and hence easier to accelerate .",
    "part of this change is due to the reduced electrical field energy inside the atom , but how does this changed field translate into reduced difficulty accelerating the atom?@xcite    the answer is back - reaction , the process by which a field acts back on its source to ( usually ) resist the acceleration of the source .",
    "when the relevant field is electromagnetic , this often amounts to ordinary self - induction .",
    "it is worth noting that almost all of the mass of everyday matter actually arises through back - reaction , as manifested in the strong nuclear field.@xcite    back - reaction provides a good illustration of the strengths and weaknesses of both dynamic and symmetry viewpoints . using the mass - energy formula immediately gives the mass contributed by the electric field of a capacitor to be @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the standard energy of the electric field between the plates .",
    "this , however , provides no understanding of how the field actually contributes to the inertia .",
    "viewing it mechanistically one sees that self - induction provides at least part of the answer , because accelerating the charges on the plates induces a changing @xmath54 field which in turn creates an @xmath55 field that acts back on the charges to resist the acceleration .",
    "students can easily calculate this for simple cases such as a parallel - plate capacitor or uniformly charged sphere , but a small problem appears : the results do nt match the relativistic prediction .",
    "indeed the dynamically computed inertia not only disagrees but ( in the case of a capacitor ) depends strongly on the direction of acceleration.@xcite    the problem is that one must also include the fields inside the material of the plates , since it is these fields that contact the charges directly and exert the back - reaction .",
    "one must also then consider the motion of the charges inside the material , including those bound within atoms . attempting to do",
    "this leads to the even more daunting problem of infinite self - fields of the particles .",
    "ultimately one can not complete the dynamical calculation except using fully renormalized quantum electrodynamics .",
    "nevertheless the naive calculations do provide valuable insight into the inertia of field energy ; indeed this is how it was first discovered , by j.j .",
    "thomson in 1881.@xcite      particle decay lifetimes are the most commonly observed manifestations of time dilation , and the essence of their mechanism can be captured using @xmath26 models .",
    "in fact the crucial factor is already visible in the driven harmonic oscillator @xmath56    we consider a resonant driving force that turns on at @xmath18 ; namely , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the step function . using this driving force , eq .",

    "( [ nomega1 ] ) , the particle fields can be viewed as collections of harmonic oscillators , one for each @xmath47 .",

    "the most tractable example is not a true decay but rather oscillation between two particles having the same mass .",
    "this can be modeled by taking two parallel , identical @xmath26 systems [ eq .  ] and attaching them to each other by additional springs running between them .",
    "we start with a wave packet only on one of the strings , moving at its group velocity @xmath62 .",
    "the packet will then oscillate between the strings and the oscillation frequency will be `` time dilated , '' i.e. , it will become slower for faster - moving packets .",

    "the two clocks start out together at the back end of a moving spaceship , and they are synchronized . due to their close proximity",
    "they are seen to be synchronized both by observers onboard the ship and also by external `` stationary '' observers ( who we assume , as usual , to have some way to view the bouncing beams inside the clocks ) .",
    "now a scientist onboard the ship carries one of the clocks to the front of the ship .",
    "this is done very slowly in order to avoid disrupting the clock s function .",
    "after this `` slow transport '' is complete the onboard observers possess two separated clocks which they can presumably consider to be synchronized.@xcite    this , however , is not how it appears to the stationary observer , as can be seen by geometrical analysis similar to that of fig .",
    "[ fig : lightclock ] .",
    "we note first that the mirror reflections have no effect on the calculation , or equivalently one may give the light clock a height @xmath76 such that it completes exactly one upward bounce during the time taken to carry it the distance @xmath77 .",

    "the carried clock gets out of synch with the non - carried clock , as seen by the external observer , no matter how slowly it is carried .",
    "the virtue of the slow - transport derivation is that it shows that any mechanism causing motion - dependent rate change also creates motion - dependent synchronization differences .",
    "if a given clock has rate change factor @xmath84 when moving at speed @xmath85 , then one shows easily that slow - carrying in the same direction as the base motion leads to a synchronization difference @xmath86 , where @xmath77 is the carry distance seen by the stationary observer .",
    "one might have thought that the extra effect would vanish for a clock carried extremely slowly , but this expectation fails because the slower the clock is carried the more time there is for the rate difference to accumulate.@xcite    comparing this derivation to the more customary `` einstein train '' thought experiment , one sees that _ for the light clock _",
    "the mechanisms are the same.@xcite in both cases the cause of the synchronization discrepancy is source - independence of wave speed .",
    "however , the clock - carrying derivation also extends to other types of clocks whose rate variation arises from different mechanisms , and it also makes sense within theories that have no massless fields at all available for signaling . for these reasons",
    "we feel that it captures the underlying mechanism of simultaneity discrepancies between observers , and deserves greater emphasis .",
    "one of the most common questions asked about relativity is why nothing can exceed the speed of light .",
    "it is difficult to answer this question in a concise and satisfying way .",
    "one standard answer is that superluminal travel combined with lorentz invariance implies time travel , and hence is paradoxical .",
    "however , this reasoning is quite formal and one would hope for a more physical understanding .",
    "a second answer is that the relativistic mass effect makes it impossible to accelerate objects to light speed , let alone beyond .",
    "this explanation is more physical but still begs the question of why mass acts this way , and also does not address massless objects .",
    "if one accepts the premise that everything is `` made from waves '' then one can give a more elementary answer .",
    "waves simply can not be sped up by applied forces .",
    "attempting to push on a wave , which one can easily try at a beach or pool , does nt make the wave go any faster but only creates more waves .",
    "speaking more forcefully does not create faster sound waves but only louder ones .",
    "waves can be slowed down by obstacles that hinder their motion , such as the springs studied in sec .",
    "[ wpgvrm ] above , but they can not be sped up . in a universe constructed from fields and waves a cosmic speed limit is inevitable by the very nature of wave motion .",
    "the mechanisms shown above make it clear that in a wave - based world the behavior of moving objects can not follow the expectations of newtonian physics . moving objects will generically change shape , while processes within moving objects will not occur at the same rate as when stationary .",
    "these changes affect all objects and processes , including those used for measurement .",
    "this means that observers in different states of motion will generically measure different values for almost every quantity,@xcite which could produce an extremely complicated situation .",
    "indeed , behaviors could be so complex that neither distance nor time , nor any other customary physical quantities can even be meaningfully defined ( observers probably could not exist under these conditions either ) .",
    "such generic , very complex field theories still formally possess one time and three space coordinates , but it could well be impossible to relate those coordinates to usable operational measurements made within those systems.@xcite    hence the generic field theory , although still exhibiting relativity - like mechanisms arising from wave behavior , is not likely to be physically interesting .",
    "what is needed is a subset of these theories having some degree of regularity , say , enough for life to evolve .",
    "if one began with knowledge of field theory but not of lorentz invariance one might well have looked for theories in which the motion - dependent effects are organized in such a way that arbitrary movements ( e.g. , orbital or galactic motion ) are not fatally disruptive . in view of the variety and pervasiveness of the mechanisms described above",
    ", this is no small order",
    ".    looked at this way it is really rather surprising that there does exist a class of field theories in which the effects are beautifully organized and tuned in exactly such a way that not only can observers exist , but moving observers can not even tell they are moving .",
    "these are , of course , the lorentz - invariant field theories . in this very restrictive class of theories",
    "one has concise and operationally meaningful definitions of time , distance , mass , energy , and momentum , and their relationships are captured in the elegant formalisms of minkowski spacetime and relativistic kinematics .",
    "hence the relationship between mechanism and symmetry has something of a chicken - and - egg character .",
    "the lorentz symmetry can ( apparently ) not be realized without the wave- and field - based mechanisms described above , and yet a generic universe built upon these mechanisms would likely be barren and uninteresting without the symmetry.@xcite",
    "teaching time is obviously limited and one may question whether it is productive to spend time on discussions that mainly add qualitative understanding .",
    "we feel that in the case of relativity it should be seriously considered in view of the absolute centrality of the concepts involved .",
    "there is no other part of the curriculum that deals primarily with the core concepts of distance , time , energy , mass , and measurement that permeate all physical thinking .",
    "the surprising ease of deriving the lorentz transformation can act , paradoxically , as a barrier to full understanding .",
    "abstract explanations based solely on postulates or symmetry hide the true complexity of the underlying processes and do not provide a complete foundation for reasoning about the fundamental concepts involved .",
    "many students are left with lingering sensations of circularity or incompleteness in the derivations as well as serious uncertainties about what the theory covers , what the alternatives to lorentz invariance are , and how effects such as length contraction relate to more familiar physical effects . consideration of the mechanisms of relativity unifies it more closely to other areas of physics and should help to forestall these sorts of confusions .",
