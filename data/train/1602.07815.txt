    "the solar - type cyclic magnetic activity is often observed among main - sequence stars with external convective envelopes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "after @xcite , it is widely believed that the magnetic activity on solar - like stars results from large - scale dynamo processes driven by turbulent convection and rotation .",
    "interpretation of the stellar magnetic activity is rather complicated because of nonlinear dynamo effects that needs to be taken into account @xcite .",
    "moreover , even in the case of the solar dynamo many details are poorly known @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the origin of the large - scale poloidal magnetic field of the sun ( the component of the field which lies in meridional planes ) is not well understood .",
    "one of the interesting question is how observations of stellar magnetic activity can help us in understanding the key processes of the solar dynamo and vice verse @xcite .",
    "the dependence of magnetic activity cycles on the period of rotation is of particular interest .",
    "observations show that the stellar magnetic activity grows almost linearly with the increasing rotation rate @xcite , but the dynamo period decreases @xcite .",
    "thus , the solar - like stars show an anti - correlation between the dynamo period and the amplitude of magnetic activity .",
    "it is interesting that this relationship can be deduced from the solar activity data @xcite , as well .",
    "a comparative study of this relation for solar and stellar cycles was published by @xcite .",
    "further studies revealed that this correlation is not unique , and that several branches corresponding to different magnetic activity levels can be identified @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the observed correlation between the amplitude and period of the dynamo cycle is expected in a kinematic regime @xcite .",
    "however , results of such linear analysis can not be applied to the nonlinear dynamo .",
    "theoretical arguments of @xcite , and , also , @xcite and @xcite had shown that dynamo saturation mechanisms affect the correlation . also , the dynamo scenario type is important in this context .",
    "the concept of flux - transport dynamo has been popular in the solar community @xcite . however , the stellar dynamo models which were constructed following this idea show a growth of the cycle period with an increase of the rotation rate , ( e.g. , see , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "this contradicts to the observations .",
    "the solution of this issue is not clear yet .",
    "@xcite found that in the framework of the flux - transport models this issue can be resolved by assuming certain multiple - cell patterns of the meridional circulation .",
    "however , it is unclear how such circulation patterns are compatible with the angular momentum balance in stars .",
    "@xcite argued that the problem with the flux - transport models can be related to the direction of the dynamo wave propagation in the convective zone . in the flux - transport models the dynamo wave propagates inward from high to low latitudes towards the regions with low magnetic diffusivity .",
    "this causes an increase of the dynamo period when the large - scale toroidal field concentrates stronger at the bottom of the convection zone .",
    "such effect has been found in 3d dynamo simulations by guerrero et al ( 2016 ) . in the distributed dynamo models @xcite the dynamo wave propagates",
    "outwards from high to low latitudes .",
    "this type of dynamo agrees with observations in case both of the solar @xcite and stellar cycles @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the influence of nonlinear dynamo saturation mechanisms on basic properties of the magnetic activity cycles in solar - like stars with different rotation rates .",
    "we restrict ourselves by slowly rotating stars with the rotational periods from 14 to 30 days . in these cases",
    "the magnetic feedback on the differential rotation is not very strong compared to the saturation caused by magnetic buoyancy and magnetic helicity . from the results of @xcite it follows that the strongest variations of the latitudinal rotational shear due to the dynamo - generated magnetic activity are about 1% of the mean value for the case of a solar analog rotating with the period of 14 days .",
    "this agrees with the observational findings of @xcite , as well .",
    "the impact of such variations on the dynamo processes is not as strong as of the others nonlinear effects .",
    "thus , we neglect variations of the differential rotation in this study .",
    "following @xcite , we explore the evolution of the induction vector of the mean magnetic field , @xmath0 , in a highly conductive turbulent media with the mean flow velocity , @xmath1 , and the mean electromotive force , @xmath2 ( hereafter memf ) , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are small - scale turbulent fluctuations of the flow velocity and magnetic field : @xmath5 we employ a decomposition of the axisymmetric field into a sum of the azimuthal ( toroidal ) and poloidal ( meridional plane ) components : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the unit vector in the azimuthal direction , @xmath8 is the polar angle , and @xmath9 is the vector - potential of the large - scale poloidal magnetic field . the mean electromotive force , @xmath10 , is expressed as follows : @xmath11 the tensor , @xmath12 , models the generation of the magnetic field by the @xmath13 effect ; the anti - symmetric tensor , @xmath14 , controls pumping of the large - scale magnetic fields in the turbulent media ; the tensor , @xmath15 , governs the turbulent diffusion and takes into account the generation of the magnetic fields by the @xmath16 effect @xcite .",
    "we take into account the effect of rotation and magnetic field on the mean - electromotive force . here , we study of the dynamo saturation due to the nonlinear @xmath13 effect and magnetic buoyancy .",
    "the @xmath13 effect takes into account the kinetic and magnetic helicities in the following form : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a free parameter , the @xmath19 and @xmath20 express the kinetic and magnetic helicity parts of the @xmath13 effect , respectively ; @xmath21 is the small - scale magnetic helicity , @xmath22 is the typical length scale of the turbulence , and @xmath23 is the turbulent diffusivity .",
    "tensors @xmath19 and @xmath20 depend on the coriolis number , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the rotational period , @xmath26 is the convective turnover time .",
    "the reader can find a detailed description of these parameters in the paper of @xcite .",
    "the magnetic quenching function of the hydrodynamical part of the @xmath13 effect is defined as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the rms of the convective velocity .",
    "this is so - called `` algebraic '' quenching describes the `` instantaneous '' magnetic feedback on the dynamo generation .",
    "it is assumed that the large - scale magnetic field varies much slower than the typical convective time - scale .",
    "in addition , there is a so - called `` dynamical '' quenching due to the magnetic helicity conservation @xcite .",
    "similarly to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ( also , see , @xcite ) , we model this effect though the second term of eq.([alp2d-1 ] ) and the equation which governs the evolution of the helicity density of the fluctuating part of magnetic field , @xmath21 , @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the total magnetic helicity density , and the @xmath32 is the diffusive flux of the magnetic helicity , @xmath33 is the magnetic reynolds number , and @xmath34 is the microscopic magnetic diffusivity .",
    "the turbulent mean - field pumping contains a sum of contributions due to the mean density gradient @xcite , @xmath35 , the diamagnetic pumping @xcite , @xmath36 , the mean - field magnetic buoyancy @xcite , @xmath37 , and due to effects of the large - scale shear @xcite , @xmath38 :    @xmath39    in our study the most essential pumping is related to the mean - field magnetic buoyancy :",

    "it is also seen that the dynamo period in model m0 increases when the dynamo approaches the stationary state .",
    "this seems to be due to the strong concentration of the dynamo wave near the bottom of the convection zone in model m0 .",

    "it is interesting to estimate how the magnetic activity changes parameters of spotness during the magnetic cycle .",
    "for this purpose we employ a simple relation between the wolf susnspot number @xmath74 and the amplitude of the toroidal magnetic field in the subsurface layer @xmath75 , @xmath76 where @xmath77 g @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath78 is slightly different to that one used in the above cited paper , because here the @xmath75 value is estimated from the layer in the upper convection zone where the maximum of the dynamo wave is located .",
    "thus , the depth of the @xmath75 is not fixed and it varies with time .",
    "this provides a smoother profile of @xmath79 for the fast rotating stars compared to the previous definition .",
    "examples of the wolf number profiles for different models are shown in figure [ fig : wolf ] .",
    "the cycle of the model m0 is substantially larger than in other models and it is not shown .",
    "it is seen that magnetic buoyancy is responsible for the most asymmetric profile of @xmath74 .",
    "also , it is found that the rise time decreases when the cycle amplitude increases .",
    "this effect works in both cases for the decrease of the rotational period and for the increase of the @xmath13-effect amplitude .",
    "similar phenomenon is observed in solar activity @xcite .",

    "for the rotational periods of 14 , 15 , and 16 days we find long - term modulations in model m2 with @xmath80 $ ] respectively . in these cases",
    "the basic dynamo period has no fixed value . for each time series of the theoretical wolf number parameter @xmath81",
    ", we extract the individual cycles and compute the cycle parameters , i.e. , the magnitude of the maximum , the period , the rise time and the decay time .",
    "we do this in the same way as previously in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : wolf]c shows variations of @xmath81 for the individual cycle profiles .",
    "these profiles were extracted from the time series of model m2 with the rotational periods of 16 days , and @xmath65 .",
    "it is seen that the stronger cycles have longer period in this set .",
    "the amplitude of the period variations is about 3 years .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath81 varies about twice of the minimal amplitude .",
    "the probability distribution functions are constructed as follows .",
    "we sort the amplitudes of @xmath81 in the increasing order and compute the cumulative probability distribution : @xmath82 where , @xmath83 is the order number ( after sorting the set in the increasing order ) , and @xmath84 is the total number of instances . in the set",
    "shown in figure [ fig : wolf]c @xmath85 .",

    "the accuracy of the approximation improves as @xmath88 .",
    "the same procedure was repeated for the period parameter .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : wolf]d ( red curve ) . from this analysis",
    "we conclude that the amplitude of @xmath81 demonstrates the existence of two populations of the stellar cycles , which can be quantified as the `` strong '' and `` weak '' cycles .",
    "the two populations are not well recognized from the distribution of the dynamo period .",
    "other examples of application of eq([cdf ] ) to analysis of the dynamo cycles were presented by @xcite .",
    "theoretical waldmeier s relations in stellar cycles .",
    "the `` sidc '' is related to the sunspot database @xcite ]    it is interesting to look how the waldmeier relations , well - known for the sunspot cycles , and the asymmetry of stellar cycles can change with the rotational period , and the magnitude of the @xmath13 effect . for this",
    "we consider model m2 and m3 .",
    "for model m2 we use only runs with the long - term modulations . similarly to @xcite we determine the mean rise and decay rate for each individual cycle in each simulatied time series of @xmath81 .",
    "the asymmetry is determined as a ratio between the decay and rise rates .",
    "figure [ wald ] shows our results .",
    "firstly , it is seen that this ratio seems to be constant for the set of the periodic dynamo models ( without long - term modulations ) .",
    "the decay rates of the dynamo cycles vary consistently with the rise rate , with the increase of the alpha effect parameter @xmath18 and the rotation rate .",
    "the theoretical trend is consistent with observations of the solar activity cycles .",
    "here we used the data set provided by @xcite .",
    "however , the time series for model m2 for the rotational periods of 14 and 16 days , which has the long - term modulation of the magnetic cycle are out of the trend .",
    "figure [ wald]b shows that these models have a correlation between the cycle amplitude and its period .",
    "that contradicts to the general trend of the periodic models and the solar observations as well .",
    "it is interesting to note that populations of the weak cycles in the long - term modulations follows the anti - correlation between the amplitude and period of cycle .",
    "the effect is not well recognized in fig.[wald]b because the scatter of the cycle parameters is relatively small .",
    "we find that this scatter is decreased with the increasing rotation rate .",
    "also the periodic models show that asymmetry increases with the increase of the cycle magnitude ( fig.[wald]c ) .",
    "the trend changes in stars with the high rotation rate and strong@xmath13-effect .",
    "this is likely because our parameterization of the cycle asymmetry is too simple and it does not take into account the possible complicated form of @xmath81 .",
    "for example , fig.6b shows the profile of @xmath81 , in which a sharp rise of activity ends by a plateau , and the maximum is not well defined .",
    "the same arguments should be taken into account in analysis of the sunspot cycles .",
    "the models with the nonlinear long - term modulations do not show a dependence of the asymmetry on the cycle magnitude .",
    "figure 5 shows a comparison of our dynamo models with the results of survey of @xcite for the absolute value of the mean line - of - sight magnetic field on the surface versus the period of rotation .",
    "we see that all the models qualitatively agree with the results of observations within the investigated range of the rotational periods .",
    "model m0 shows a stronger magnetic field than it is found in the observations .",
    "this indicates on the presence of additional dynamo saturation mechanisms , like those implemented in models m1 and m2 , i.e. , the nonlinear quenching due to the magnetic buoyancy or the magnetic helicity .",
    "as noted in introduction , for rapidly rotating stars the magnetic feedback on the differential rotation and convection has to be taken into account as well .",
    "models m3a and m3b show different results for the different magnitude of the @xmath13-effect parameter , @xmath18 .",
    "we see that the observed scatter of the magnetic field strength can be explained by variations of @xmath18 , varing by a factor of two above the dynamo instability threshold . from the solar dynamo models results we know that a similar effect can be produced by a small fluctuations of @xmath13 on the time scale comparable with the length of the magnetic cycle @xcite .",
    "the investigated sample of rotational periods can be related to different ages of the sun - like stars .",
    "taking into account the slowdown of rotation with time as @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the star s age @xcite , we deduce that age of stars in our sample can be found from the relation : @xmath91 , where @xmath92 days and @xmath93 gyr are parameters of the modern sun .",
    "thus , the investigated sample of the rotational periods covers the range of ages from 1.5 to 6.2 gyr .",
    "however , on this time scale changes of the convection zone structure have to be taken into account .",
    "the percentage of disk occupied by sunspots is estimated from the empirical correlation @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "figure 6 shows our estimation for amplitude of @xmath95 at the maximum and minimum ( dashed curve ) of magnetic cycle with the age for model m2 .",
    "it shows that the younger stars are significantly more spotty , this is a rather naive estimate which does not take into account mechanisms of the sunspot formations , and also changes of the convection zone and the differential rotation with the stellar age .",
    "we have studied the nonlinear magnetic feedback on the turbulent generation of the large - scale magnetic fields by a solar - type dynamo for the range of rotation periods from 14 to 30 days .",
    "our models take into account the non - linear @xmath13 effect , the balance of magnetic helicity density , and escape of magnetic field from the dynamo region due to magnetic buoyancy .",
    "we did not consider the possible magnetic feedback on the differential rotation and changes in the convection zone stucture .",
    "currently , one of the most important observational tests for dynamo models of solar - like stars is the relationship between the magnetic cycle periods and the period of stellar rotation .",
    "earlier , @xcite , also @xcite and @xcite had suggested that despite a seemingly linear character of the connection between the rotational period and the dynamo period in stellar magnetic activity , the relation is not trivial because the large - scale dynamo goes to a non - linear regime when the rotation rate increases .",
    "the revealed multiple populations of magnetic activity in late - type stars @xcite showed that the theoretical interpretation of stellar magnetic activity can be complicated .",
    "it was suggested that the `` active '' population of stars operates the dynamo concentrated near the bottom of the convection zone , and the `` inactive '' population that operates @xcite a distributed dynamo . in most cases ,",
    "the models of the first type show an increase of the dynamo period with increasing of rotation rate @xcite and are not consistent with observations .",
    "our results show that the observed correlation between the period of rotation and the dynamo period can be explained by the distributed dynamo models that includes the dynamical magnetic feedback on the turbulent generation either due to the magnetic buoyancy or the magnetic helicity .",
    "note that the magnetic buoyancy effect which is employed in the paper is related to buoyancy of large - scale magnetic fields and not to the so - called flux - tube buoyancy @xcite .",
    "@xcite discussed the issue in details .",
    "in our set of dynamo models we did not find a satisfactory explanation of the observed multiple populations in terms of the stellar activity cycles periods .",
    "a number of possibile hypothesises remains to be explored .",
    "for example , our study is limited to magnetic field configurations that are anti - symmetric relative to the equator . the magnetic parity breaking is often considered as a source of non - linear long - term modulations of solar activity @xcite .",
    "this may be the case for the stellar activity as well .",
    "the correlation between the period of rotation and the dynamo period could be affected by changes of the convection zone characteristics and changes of the differential rotation profile @xcite .",
    "models with long - term modulations and dynamical quenching of the @xmath13-effect by the magnetic helicity conservation show two populations of the activity cycles .",
    "the population of the weak cycles tends to follow standard the waldmeir s rules .",
    "but these do not hold for the whole time series .",
    "@xcite presentented a diagram of stellar magnetic activity for the period of rotation versus the stellar mass diagram of magnetic activity , which shows that fast rotating solar mass stars have non - axisymmetric magnetic fields .",
    "it is not clear if the non - axisymmetric field on the fast rotating solar analogs is generated by the dynamo instability or results from emergence of magnetic field on the surface .",
    "the non - axisymmetric fields is rarely discussed in the solar type dynamo .",
    "it presumes that the differential rotation suppresses the non - axisymmetric dynamo @xcite .",
    "however , for the @xmath96 dynamos , the critical threshold for generation of non - axisymmetric magnetic fields is only about a factor 2 or 3 larger than those for the axisymmetric dynamo .",
    "the interaction of the axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric modes was never studied for the super - critical regimes which could be operated in fast rotating stars .",
    "finite non - axisymmetric perturbations can also affect the axisymmetric dynamo @xcite .",
    "future studies should show if the observed multiple populations of magnetic cycles in stellar activity can be explored by differences between the axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric dynamo models .                                                                                                      ,",
