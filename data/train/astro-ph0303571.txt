    "first , the mbh is a mass sink , which drives a flow of stars from the mbh radius of influence @xmath0 to the center , to replace those it has destroyed",
    ". an inevitable consequence of this flow is that some stars are deflected into orbits whose periapse @xmath1 lies just outside the critical radius for destruction .",
    "we will focus here on the case where the mbh mass @xmath2 is small enough so that the tidal disruption radius @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the stellar mass and radius , lies outside the event horizon @xmath6 , ( @xmath7 for a solar type star ) .",
    "such stars will suffer an extreme tidal impulse , but will not be destroyed , at least not on their first peri - passage .",
    "there are two possible outcomes : that the star is ultimately disrupted , or that it avoids subsequent encounters with the mbh .",
    "both are considered in detail below .",
    "second , a variety of formation scenarios predict that mbhs should lie in the center of a high density stellar cusp ( e.g. bahcall & wolf 1977 ; young 1980 ) .",
    "the diverging stellar density implies that there must be some volume around the mbh where close tidal encounters occur on timescales significantly shorter than the typical stellar lifetime .",
    "such encounters will have a very different outcome from those that occur in globular clusters that do not contain a mbh .",
    "in most cases the encounters will not lead to tidal capture .",
    "instead the two stars will continue on their separate ways after experiencing a brief strong tidal impulse .",
    "extreme tidal interactions , which transfer energy and angular momentum from the orbit to the star , can affect its structure and subsequent evolution by heating it , spinning it up , mixing it , or ejecting some of its mass .",
    "this is interesting in view of the observed presence of unusual stellar populations near mbhs : the blue nuclear cluster in the inner @xmath8 pc of the gc ( genzel et al .",
    "1997 ) , and around the mbh in m31 ( lauer et al . 1998 ) ; evidence for anomalously strong rotational dredge - up in an m supergiant near the mbh in the gc ( carr , sellgren & balachandran 2000 ) , but not in a high density nuclear cluster without a mbh ( ramrez et al . 2000 ) ; the unusually high concentration of very rare extreme blue he supergiants around the galactic mbh ( krabbe et al . 1991",
    "; najarro et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the observational consequences of extreme tidal interactions can not be predicted with certainty at this time , although some reasonable conjectures can be made ( alexander & livio 2001 ; alexander & morris 2003 ) .",
    "irrespective of this uncertainty , it is clear , as shown below , that the amount of tidal energy deposited in the star can reach a significant fraction of its binding energy , and that the angular momentum extracted from the orbit can spin a star up to a significant fraction of its break - up velocity .",
    "it is therefore plausible to assume that the effects can be observationally interesting and proceed to explore the dynamical processes that give rise to such tidal interactions .",
    "furthermore , tidal disruption and collisional stellar mass loss are important channels for supplying mass to a low - mass mbh ( murphy , cohn & durisen 1991 ) , and so the consequences of extreme tidal processes may provide observable links between the properties of the stellar population near the mbh and its evolutionary history .    at a distance of @xmath9 kpc ( reid 1993 ) , the low mass @xmath10 mbh in the galactic center ( gc ) ( ghez et al . 2000 ; schdel et al . 2002 ) is the nearest and observationally most accessible mbh . although it is heavily reddened ( @xmath11 , blum et al .",
    "1996 ) , deep high resolution astrometric , photometric and spectroscopic ir observations of thousands of stars very close to the mbh provide information on their luminosity , effective temperature and orbits ( e.g. eckart , ott & genzel 1999 ; figer et al . 2000 ; gezari et al . 2002 ) .",
    "since the gc is the obvious first place to look for evidence of extreme tidal interactions , the results presented here will be applied to the gc , but it should be emphasized that these physical mechanisms are generally relevant for mbh in galactic nuclei .",
    "stars in the high keplerian velocity field in a dense stellar cusp around a mbh will suffer numerous hyperbolic tidal encounters over their lifetimes .",
    "although such encounters transfer some energy and angular momentum from the orbit to the colliding stars , they rarely remove enough energy for tidal capture .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the situation in the high density cores of globular clusters without a mbh , where the colliding stars are on nearly zero - energy orbits and close collisions lead to the formation of tidal binaries .",
    "the effects of hyperbolic encounters on the stars are mostly transient .",
    "the stellar dynamical and thermal timescales are very short compared to the mean time between collisions , and so apart from some mass - loss in very close collisions , the star is largely unaffected .",
    "it is however more difficult for the star to shed the excess angular momentum , since magnetic breaking operates on timescales of the order of the stellar lifetime ( gray 1992 ) .",
    "high rotation is therefore the longest lasting dynamical after - effect of a close encounter . over time",
    ", the stellar angular momentum will grow in a random walk fashion due to successive , randomly oriented tidal encounters .",
    "we consider the effect of the tides raised by an impactor star of mass @xmath2 on a target star of mass @xmath4 and radius @xmath5 as the impactor follows an unbound orbit with periapse @xmath1 from the target star .",
    "the tilde symbol will be used below to denote quantities expressed in units where @xmath12 . in these units",
    ", @xmath13 is the centrifugal break - up angular frequency , @xmath14 is the stellar binding energy , up to a factor of order unity , and @xmath15 is the mbh tidal radius .",
    "the orbital energy @xmath16 and the orbital angular momentum @xmath17 that are transferred from the orbit to the star by an impulsive tidal encounter are related by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the relative angular velocity at periapse .",
    "we assume here for simplicity rigid body rotation .",
    "the change in the stellar angular velocity due to a single parabolic encounter is then given to the leading order in the linear multipole expansion by ( press & teukolsky 1977 ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the stellar moment of inertia ( assumed to remain constant ) , @xmath22 is the @xmath23 tidal coupling coefficient ( calculated numerically for a given stellar structure model ) , and @xmath24^{1/2}$ ] is the dimensionless transit time of the encounter .",
    "the steep @xmath25 dependence indicates that most of the contribution comes from very close encounters , where the linear expansion no longer holds .",
    "the formal divergence at small periapse must be truncated by non - linear effects , which have to be investigated numerically . smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ f : bhtide ] ) of grazing and penetrating encounters show that as @xmath26 is decreased , @xmath27 first increases above the value predicted by linear theory , and then saturates at the onset of mass loss , as the ejecta carry away the excess angular momentum .    these results can be incorporated into the linear theory by simple prescriptions , making it possible to calculate the mean spin - up of a test star by averaging over all impact parameters , orbital energies and impactor masses for a given model of the nuclear stellar cluster ( alexander & kumar 1999 ) . figure  [ f : spin - up ]",
    "shows the mean spin - up of a solar mass star after 10 gyr near the mbh in the gc , as function of distance from the mbh , in a high density , @xmath28 cusp of a continuously star forming population that is deduced to exist there ( alexander & sternberg 1999 ; alexander 1999 ) .",
    "the mean spin - up reaches values as high as @xmath29 within 0.03 pc , ( @xmath30 times higher than is typical in the field ) and decreases to @xmath31 within 0.3 pc ( @xmath32 to @xmath33 of @xmath34 ) .",
    "the spin - up effect falls off only slowly with distance from the black hole because the increased tidal coupling in slower collisions at larger distances compensates for the decrease in the stellar density .",
    "thus , long - lived main sequence stars with inefficient magnetic breaking are expected to rotate at a significant fraction of their centrifugal breakup velocity in a large volume of the dense stellar cusp around a mbh .",
    "tidal disruption is an important channel for feeding low - mass mbhs that accrete from a low density cusp where collisional mass - loss is low .",
    "numeric models of the growth of a mbh in a central cluster suggest that the fraction of the mbh mass that is supplied by tidal disruption ranges between @xmath35 ( murphy , cohn & durisen 1991 ) and @xmath36 ( freitag & benz 2002 ) , depending on model assumptions .",
    "we will here @xmath37 as a representative value .",
    "dynamical analyses of the 2-body scattering by which stars are deflected into `` loss - cone '' orbits that bring them within @xmath38 of the mbh ( frank & rees 1976 ; frank 1978 ; lightman & shapiro 1977 ; magorrian & tremaine 1999 ; syer & ulmer 1999 ) show that tidally disrupted stars are typically on slightly unbound orbits relative to the mbh , and that they mostly originate from the mbh radius of influence , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the 1d velocity dispersion far from the mbh .",
    "the stellar mass enclosed within @xmath34 is comparable to @xmath41 .",
    "the cross - section for such stars to pass within @xmath26 of the mbh scales as @xmath42 roughly equals the mbh mass , a star on a plunging orbit will pass the mbh with a velocity slightly above the local escape velocity .",
    "second , @xmath34 is where the loss - cone replenishment efficiency peaks sharply , at the transition from the empty loss - cone ( `` diffusive '' , or `` small angle scattering '' ) regime and the full loss - cone ( `` pinhole '' , or `` large angle scattering '' ) regime .",
    "deflection by large angles relative to the loss cone opening angle leads to an isotropic redistribution of the velocity.](hills 1975 ; see also ",
    "[ s : inspiral ] ) .",
    "it then follows that for every star on an orbit with @xmath43 that is promptly disrupted , there is a star that skirts the tidal disruption zone on an orbit with @xmath44 .",
    "such `` tidally scattered '' stars narrowly escape disruption on their first peri - passage after being subjected to extreme tidal distortion , spin - up , mixing ad mass - loss ( fig .",
    "[ f : bhtide ] ) .",
    "we will now argue that there is also a high probability that these stars will avoid subsequent total disruption , either by being deflected off their orbit or by missing the mbh due to its brownian motion ( alexander & livio 2001 ) .    first , the scattering timescale is shorter than the dynamical one , and so stars wander in and out of the loss - cone several times during one orbital period .",
    "after the first peri - passage , the stars are on very eccentric orbits with apoastron @xmath45 , and so there is a considerable chance that they will be scattered again out of the loss - cone before their next close passage , and avoid eventual orbital decay and disruption .",
    "second , the survival probability is further increased by the brownian motion of the bh relative to the dynamical center of the stellar system . a low mass mbh which evolves in an initially constant density core of radius @xmath46 ,",
    "is estimated to have brownian fluctuations with an amplitude that is much larger than the tidal radius ( bahcall & wolf 1976 ) , @xmath47 the brownian motion proceeds on the dynamical timescale of the core , which is comparable to the orbital period of the tidally scattered stars .",
    "the orbits of these stars take them outside of @xmath34 , where they are dynamically affected only by the center of mass of the nucleus , and not by the relative shift between the mbh and the stellar mass . therefore , on re - entry into the volume of influence , their orbit will not bring them to the same peri - distance from the mbh .",
    "these order of magnitude arguments are verified by more detailed analysis ( see  [ s : inspiral ] ) , which shows that the survival probability of tidally scattered stars is @xmath48@xmath49 .",
    "it then follows that the mass fraction of surviving tidally scattered stars within @xmath34 , which passed once within @xmath50 of the mbh , is comparable to the mass fraction of the mbh supplied by tidal disruption .",
    "depending on the definition of what constitutes an extreme tidal interaction , there exists a maximal periapse , parameterized by @xmath51 , that corresponds to sufficiently strong tidal interactions .",
    "for example , for a solar type star , @xmath52 corresponds to a minimal tidal energy deposition of @xmath53 ( eq . [ e : de ] ) .",
    "since the angular velocity at periapse is @xmath54 and the solar moment of inertia @xmath55 , this corresponds also to a minimal angular spin deposition of @xmath56 and a minimal spin - up of @xmath57 . over time , the mass fraction of tidally scattered stars within @xmath46 will rise to @xmath58 ( for @xmath37 , @xmath52 and @xmath59 ) .",
    "tidally scattered stars thus constitute a non - negligible fraction of the stellar population in the mbh radius of influence , and will remain there as relics of the early stages of the mbh evolution even after its mass grows above the tidal disruption limit , possibly detectable by correlations between unusual spectral properties and highly eccentric orbits .",
    "however , we find that the _ tidal _ inspiral rate is only @xmath60 of the prompt disruption rate , and _ not _ the factor 23 enhancement due to tidal capture that was assumed by previous studies .",
    "we conclude that the contribution of tidal capture to the mbh mass budget and to the tidal flaring rate from galactic nuclei is negligible compared to prompt disruption .",
    "past studies , which assigned similar weights to prompt disruption and tidal capture , over - estimated the contribution of tidal disruption to the growth of the mbh by at least a factor of two .",
    "we have shown that strong tidal interactions of stars with a mbh or with other stars in the high density cusp around a mbh can deposit large amounts of orbital energy and angular momentum in a significant fraction of the stellar population within a large volume around the mbh .",
    "we propose that such interactions can alter the evolution and appearance of stars in galactic centers and thereby probe the evolution of the mbh and the stellar system around it .",
    "we explored tidal spin - up by star - star encounters , tidal scattering by a mbh and tidal inspiral into a mbh .",
    "we showed that tidal capture is inefficient in the presence of two body scattering .",
