    "the notion of biorthogonality is especially useful when dealing with elements that are analytic functions defined on a contour in the complex plane .  in this case , the linear functionals are usually realized as integrals along the contour involving a set of dual functions  @xmath7 , so@xmath8 however , it is important to stress that _ a priori _ there need not be a simple point - by - point relation between the functions and their duals ( unlike the standard situation in quantum mechanics ) .  in general , @xmath9 is _ not _ obtained just by conjugation , and differs substantially from @xmath10 , even when the contour of integration is a real line segment .",

    "a goal of this paper is to examine this consistency in some detail , and to discuss these connections .    while simple , this is still an interesting dynamical system .  however , there is some ambiguity about what @xmath119 represents when @xmath123 and @xmath122 are complex .",

    "@xcite , we choose to continue the model into the complex plane simply by complexification of the usual form of hamilton s equations of motion , without complex conjugation of any of the variables appearing in those equations .",

    "is conserved @xmath128 .",
    "so under this complexification procedure there are in fact two conserved real quantities , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",

    "@xmath146 and @xmath123 have transparent high energy limits .  from ( [ pclassical ] )",
    "it is straightforward to establish by direct calculation for real @xmath137 that @xmath143 evolves around a circle in the complex plane , of radius @xmath147 , whose center is on the real axis at @xmath148 .",
    "it also follows from ( [ pclassical ] ) that the momentum s angular velocity around the circle is _ not _ constant , but varies .",
    "in addition , for real @xmath137 a turning point is encountered if and only if @xmath149 , implying the @xmath123 circle has infinite radius and degenerates into a vertical straight line in the complex plane , as described by purely imaginary momentum trajectories @xmath150 .  correspondingly , the @xmath122 trajectory for @xmath151 is along a vertical line in the complex plane , with fixed @xmath135 .",
    "for example , this can occur when @xmath152 and @xmath153 , in which cases the @xmath122 trajectory bounces off  the real axis at @xmath154 .",
    "the @xmath155 motion is somewhat simpler , but still has interesting structure , and is given as follows.@xmath156 again , the momentum evolves along a circle of finite radius in the complex plane , approaching the origin as a limit , except in the special situations @xmath157 , which correspond to circles of infinite radius .  in these special cases ,",

    "so with the @xmath160  as exhibited in ( [ x(0)=npi ] ) , @xmath163 goes to @xmath164 as @xmath165 and goes to @xmath166 as @xmath167 .",
    "in fact , no matter what @xmath142 is , the @xmath155 solution always has an imaginary part that behaves as @xmath168 for at least one choice of sign .",

    "of course , as indicated by the explicit transformation ( [ classicalxtotheta ] ) , complex energy would require extending the free particle trajectories into both the complex @xmath175 and the complex @xmath176 planes .",
    "the classical trajectories and the classical canonical transformation which we have just described will appear explicitly in the quantum mechanics of the model , to be discussed in the next section , where they play pivotal roles in canonical integral representations of the wave functions and their duals .  but",
    "before ending our discussion of classical dynamics and turning our attention to quantization , some comments on the canonical structure of this system would seem to be in order .  indeed , this issue is brought into particular focus by our previous remarks concerning classical canonical transformations .",
    "we _ might _ have proceeded as in the usual case of a particle on the plane , and assumed the real and imaginary components of @xmath192 and @xmath193 are independently canonical , up to some overall isotropic  scale @xmath194 , with poisson brackets ( pbs ) given by @xmath195   _ { \\text{pb}}=\\sigma $ ] ,  @xmath196   _ { \\text{pb}}% = \\sigma$ ] ,  @xmath197   _ { \\text{pb}% } = 0 $ ] ,  @xmath198   _ { \\text{pb}}% = 0 $ ] ,  etc .  had we done so , we would then have had for _ any _ value of @xmath194 the brackets @xmath199   _ { \\text{pb}}=0 $ ] ,  @xmath200   _ { \\text{pb}}=0 $ ] ,  @xmath201   _ { \\text{pb}}=0 $ ] .",

    "hollowood @xcite has previously discussed separate but related issues in his study of solitons for complex toda theories using conventional hilbert space methods and perturbation theory .",
    "we may attempt to place an upper bound on the ground state @xmath629 using the conventional hilbert space norm through an adaptation @xcite of the variational argument of  iii in coleman @xcite .",

    "we find@xmath638 therefore , by choosing @xmath639such that @xmath640 is real and negative , and then letting @xmath641 , there is no lower bound on @xmath642 if @xmath643 .  thus in the usual fock space framework , there is no ground state if @xmath644 exceeds @xmath274 .",
    "this may indicate a phase - transition for the field theory .    for the field",
    "theoretic extension corresponding to the model ( [ h ] ) , with @xmath435 , the rhs of ( [ trialaverageh ] ) becomes just a sum over @xmath645 with various @xmath3 .",
    "thus the variational argument shows an instability whenever the sum over @xmath235  includes @xmath646 .",
    "the problem is now to determine how this variational argument is effected by using the bilocal norm instead of the usual hilbert space norm .",
    "the operator methods in @xcite  and/or the functional methods in @xcite  should suffice for this purpose .",
    "there have been studies of the variational principle for similar quasi - hermitian  theories @xcite and the techniques introduced in those studies should be applicable to expectations of ( [ liouvilleenergydensity ] ) .  this issue will be fully discussed elsewhere .",
    "here we only remark that the situation is reminiscent of @xmath647 field theory , which also has no ground state based on conventional variational arguments using the standard hilbert space norm and trial states with real expectations @xmath648 , but which appears to be an acceptable model when viewed as pt symmetric @xmath649 theory @xcite .",
    "this is unquestionably related to the use of the cpt norm , but more directly , it is due to the definition of the zero - mode problem on a contour in the lhp , and not the real axis .",
    "this obviates most physical intuition about the ground state of that theory , in our opinion .",
    "even so , there are obviously major differences between pt symmetric @xmath647 field theory and imaginary liouville theory as defined by ( [ liouvilleenergydensity ] ) , in that the apparent instability in @xmath650 field theory  is evident at the classical level for any coupling strength , whereas the instability indicated by ( [ trialaverageh ] ) for @xmath643 is a purely quantum effect .",
    "we made a thorough analysis of some complex one dimensional periodic potentials , of liouville type , within the framework of biorthogonal systems .",
    "we provided an extensive guide to the considerable literature for these models .",
    "we conclude that these systems are consistent at both classical and quantum mechanical levels , with remarkable and deep connections between the two levels , just as in the case of real liouville models .",
    "in fact , the connections are more intimate in the complex case , inasmuch as the classical structure is richer .",
    "we studied in some detail the correspondence and impact of the classical dynamics on that of the quantum problem .",
    "more specifically we have shown that the complex liouville model is equivalent to a projected free particle system , and we may choose that free particle projection to be chiral .  with that choice , the complex hamiltonian may be viewed as a completely local description for the free chiral particle , the only such local hamiltonian description known to us .",
    "we have used the remarkable properties of neumann polynomials as the biorthogonal partners of bessel functions on a circle in the complex plane . with those properties in hand , we obtained closed forms for the inner product and various other hermitian kernels .",
    "we enlarged this study to include a wide class of complex periodic one dimensional hamiltonians , and we obtained similar closed form results in several additional cases .     in our analysis ,",
    "the theory of pt symmetric models was often a guide but did not play a decisive role insofar as the states were self - orthogonal in the periodic sectors that we emphasized and some of the models that we considered were not pt symmetric .",
    "moreover , many of the concepts that we used are already contained in the previously existing framework of biorthogonal systems .",
    "as stressed in the title of the paper , the use of biorthonormal systems of vectors for the construction of consistent quantum mechanical systems was the real conceptual lift , applicable even when the states are self - orthogonal .",
    "the most important feature shared with the pt symmetric approach was simply that of a complex hamiltonian with real eigenvalues .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate biorthogonal systems for self - orthogonal subsectors of other solvable complex potential models , e.g. those in @xcite , for which the duals would seem to be the associated functions described in @xcite .",
    "another interesting and possibly important challenge is to combine the biorthogonal approach with the study of symmetries of the hamiltonian .  beyond the usual commutators between any local symmetry generators , there must also be commutation relations among the various bilocal kernels .",
    "thus the full set of symmetries of the corresponding quantum problem may not be local and may not be obvious .",
    "along these lines , it is perhaps a useful working hypothesis that any consistent local complex hamiltonian with real eigenvalues is related by a similarity transformation to that of a hermitian , albeit nonlocal , hamiltonian .",
    "however , this conceptual device may not always lead to practical calculational tools as this similarity transformation is usually not known , a priori , and may be difficult to implement when it is known .    a clear and readable discussion on the use of similarity transformations to expose the hermitian underpinnings of certain _ apparently _ non - hermitian ( i.e. quasi - hermitian ) theories is given in @xcite ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "the general theory is nicely illustrated in a recent paper on pt - symmetric @xmath651 quantum mechanics @xcite , where after the change of variable @xmath652 , @xmath653 , the relevant similarity transformation is very simple and easily implemented .",
    "while substantial progress has already been made on several pt symmetric field theories @xcite , it is important to apply the methods of biorthogonal systems to more general quantum field theories and many - body problems , particularly those of the complex liouville and toda type .",
    "it remains a challenge to consider situations involving self - orthogonal states in these models , to compute correlation functions using those states , and to investigate their possible relevance for string theories .",
    "the study of the present paper may lead to a deeper appreciation of the behavior of quantum liouville field theory for complex coupling constants , as sketched in section 8 .",
    "this would further understanding of subcritical string theory , especially the correlators for those models which exhibit interesting structure in the complex coupling plane ( cf . @xcite and references therein , especially @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , liouville theory with imaginary coupling ( or its close cousin under complex continuation  so - called timelike  liouville theory ) has already been analyzed using conformal field theory methods @xcite .",
    "we believe the hamiltonian analysis initiated above will help shed additional light on this subject .    moreover , the field theory extensions of the models described in section 7 are relevant to applications of conformal field theory and phase - transitions",
    ".  in particular , complex liouville field theory may be useful to understand freezing transitions @xcite .",
    "more recently , there is very interesting work @xcite involving complex liouville field theory in non - hermitian luttinger liquids and flux line pinning in planar superconductors .",
    "as for other possible physical applications of the techniques in this paper , it is perhaps interesting to conjecture that coupled bose - einstein systems with dissipative effects might be governed by relatively simple non - hermitian effective hamiltonians .",
    "this could be , in several respects , a completely quantum analogue of the classical driven / damped oscillator systems discussed in @xcite .",
