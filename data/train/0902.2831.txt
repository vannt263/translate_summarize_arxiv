    "despite the fact that there are still a great deal of unresolved problems , recent numerous observational and theoretical studies showed that active galactic nucleus ( agn ) plays an important role in galaxy evolution .",
    "the mass of central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) is believed to growth simultaneously with the formation of the bulge of the host where the smbh resides in as clued by the well - established @xmath3 relation ( e.g. , magorrian et al .",

    "another clue of the coevolution of smbh and starburst is the fact that both quasar activity density and star formation rate ( sfr ) density apparently peak at @xmath4 ( e.g. , nandra et al . 2005 ) . by adopting a variety of mechanisms of feedback from black hole growth on star formation occurring in the bulge",
    ", a series of models were developed to explain the co - evolution of agn and its host galaxy ( e.g. , fabian 1999 ; begelman & nath 2005 ; granato et al .",
    "2004 ; springel et al .",
    "2005a , b ; hopkins et al . 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "understanding how agn co - evolves with star formation in detail is , however , seriously impeded by the trouble caused by the orientation effect ( see review in antonucci 1993 ; elitzur 2007 ) .",
    "briefly , the starlight component is usually masked by the strong continuum and broad emission lines emitted from the central engine in the spectra of type i agns . on the contrary",
    ", the starlight component can be much more easily detected in type ii agns , however the agn continuum and broad lines are blocked by the torus .",
    "so far , a variety of approaches have been adopted to overcome the problem by different authors .",

    "( in preparation ) , these authors examined the co - evolution of agn and star formation by using the local partially obscured agns ( i.e. , seyfert 1.8/1.9 galaxies ) selected from the mpa / jhu sdss dr4 catalog ( e.g. , kauffmann et al .",
    "2003a , b , c ) .",
    "the spectra of these galaxies show good balance between the agn and starlight components , which allows the authors to directly determine the properties of both agn and stellar population simultaneously in individual object .",
    "they then proposed an evolutionary scenario that the eddington ratio decreases as the circumnuclear stellar population ages ( see also in heckman et al .",
    "2004 ; kewley et al .",
    "2006 , wild et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "we attempt to extend these studies to objects within @xmath0 in this paper .",
    "since the emission of evolved stars drops significantly at short wavelength region , the broad @xmath52800 emission line could be used to directly estimate the properties of central smbh when broad h@xmath6 emission is weak or strongly contaminated by the star light and when h@xmath7 emission is shifted out of the optical region . here , we focus on the quasars with hybrid spectral properties ( hereafter `` hybrid qsos '' for short ) : a ) the spectrum redward of the balmer limit is dominated by a starlight component ; b ) at the same time , the spectrum at blue end shows an evident broad @xmath52800 emission line that is emitted from the central agn . to our knowledge at present , similar object is only studied in detail ( for stellar population only ) in the particular post - starburst qso , unj1025 - 0040 , by brotherton et al .",
    "another striking case with similar spectrum is reported in sdssj231055 - 090107 ( canalizo et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we first select a sample of 15 hybrid qsos from the sdss .",
    "the detailed spectral analysis is then performed in three objects : sdssj163446.49 + 461946.7 ( at @xmath8 , abbreviated here as sdssj1634 + 4619 ) , sdssj102633.32 + 103443.8 ( at @xmath9 , abbreviated here as sdssj1026 + 1034 ) and sdss090036.44 + 381353.0 ( at @xmath10 , abbreviated here as sdss0900 + 3813 ) .",
    "the spectra of the three objects have high adequate average signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios of whole spectra ( see table 1 ) , appropriate emission profiles and stellar absorption features ( especially the 4000  break features ) .",

    "the @xmath11cdm cosmology with parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) is adopted throughout the paper .",
    "sdss is an ambitious project designed to eventually survey one - quarter of the entire sky in images and spectra ( york et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the survey is carried out by a dedicated wide - field ( 3 ) 2.5 m telescope located at apache point observatory .",
    "the telescope is equipped with two fiber - fed spectrographs and a mosaic ccd camera .",
    "each spectrum is taken with a 3 diameter fiber aperture .",
    "the spectra have a resolution @xmath15 ( corresponds to @xmath16 ) , and cover a wavelength range from 3800 to 9200  in the observer s frame .",
    "the spectra are spectrophotometrically calibrated within an accuracy of @xmath120% by observing subdwarf f stars in each 3 field of view .",
    "the raw spectra are reduced automatically by the developed pipelines , spectro2d and specbs ( glazebrook et al .",
    "1998 ; bromley et al . 1998 ) .    at first , according to the redshifts determined by the sdss pipelines , we select the galaxies and quasars within @xmath0 from the sdss data release 6 catalogs ( adelman - mccarthy et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the redshift range ensures that both @xmath52800 emission line and 4000  feature ( at the rest frame ) shift into the wavelength coverage at observer s frame . the @xmath52800 line emission is then required to be detected above 3@xmath17 significance level according to the emission - line measurements provided by the sdss pipelines .",
    "the selected sample contains 1,946 galaxies and 7,694 quasars fulfilling the above criteria .",
    "an automatic routine is developed to select the hybrid quasars whose spectra have an evident break around the rest - frame wavelength 4000 , i.e. , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 ( bruzual 1983 ; balogh et al .",
    "the selected spectra of quasars and galaxies are then inspected by eyes one by one .",
    "finally , the selection results in a sample of totally 15 candidates of hybrid qsos .",
    "we emphasize that the selection outlined above provides a representative sample of hybrid qsos ( though not necessarily complete ) .",
    "given the @xmath20 criterion , our selection would miss the qsos whose spectra are extremely blue or dominated by extremely hot stars .",
    "in the first case , the blue agn continuum dilutes the 4000  drop that is caused by the stellar absorptions .",
    "the starlight component is therefore hard to be identified and separated from the observed spectra ( the same for the second case ) .",
    "the sample is listed in table 1 . for each object",
    ", the table shows its plate number , modified julian date of the observation , number of fiber on the plate , redshift , equivalent width of the emission line , corresponding s / n ratio of , and average s / n ratio of the whole spectrum .",
    "the observed spectra are displayed in figure 1 .",
    "except the three objects sdssj1634 + 4619 , sdssj1026 + 1034 and sdss0900 + 3813 , detailed spectral analysis is a hard task for most of the candidates listed in the sample at the current stage , either because of the low average s / n ratios of the whole spectra or because of the poor profiles and blurry 4000  break features . in order to determine their physical properties , deeper spectroscopic observations are necessary for the remaining objects . at first glance",
    "each of the three spectra is dominated by both an underlying powerlaw continuum and a broad emission line attributed to agn at the blue part , and by a spectrum of an intermediate - massive star ( i.e. , a to g type ) at the red part .",
    "the evident starlight component allows us to separate the contribution of the host galaxy from each observed spectrum .",
    "additionally , the properties of the black hole accretion could be derived from the evident broad emission line .",
    "the observed spectra are at first smoothed with a boxcar of 6 pixels ( @xmath110 ) to enhance the s / n ratios and the accuracy of spectral measurements .",
    "the smoothed spectra are then reduced through the standard procedures by iraf package , including galactic extinction and redshift corrections .",
    "the galactic extinction is corrected for each spectrum by the color excess @xmath21 adopted from ned assuming an extinction curve with @xmath22 ( cardilli et al .",
    "each galactic extinction - corrected spectrum is then transformed to the rest frame according to the redshift given by the sdss pipelines .",
    "the reduced spectra at the rest frame are displayed in figure 2 ( see the solid curve in each panel ) .",
    "each spectrum clearly shows not only a discontinuity at around 4000  caused by the metal absorptions of stars , but also a strong broad emission line superposed on an underlying agn continuum at blue end .",
    "evident h@xmath23 and h , k absorption features can be identified in the spectra of both sdssj1634 + 4619 and sdssj1026 + 1034 .",
    "although the spectrum of sdss0900 + 3813 shows relatively weak h@xmath23 absorption , the h , k absorptions are still strong .",
    "the presence of nuclear accretion activity in the three objects is additionally supported by the marginally detectable high ionization lines , such as [ ] @xmath53868 , [ ] @xmath243426 , 3346 .    the single stellar population ( ssp )",
    "models developed by bruzual & charlot ( 2003 , bc03 ) are used to interpret the observed starlight spectra for the three hybrid qsos . at the beginning , we extract a series of spectra from the bc03 ssp models with the chabrier imf at different metallicities . for a given metallicity , we attempt to reproduce each observed starlight component by the linear combination of five instantaneous bursts at different ages .",
    "the ages range from 0.4 to 4.0gyr ( i.e. , 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.8 , 1.0 , 4.0gyr ) .",
    "since a starlight spectrum is predicted to evolve slightly after 1.0 gyr , the 4.0gyr old stellar population is used to reproduce the underlying old stellar population .",
    "the bursts younger than 0.4gyr are not considered in our spectral modeling both because of the evident h@xmath23 and absorptions and because of the likely degeneracy between the spectrum of very young stellar population and agn blue continuum .    in summary , in order to model the observed spectra",
    ", our template contains the starlight spectra of the five instantaneous bursts at the given stellar population ages , a powerlaw continuum and an uv template that are both attributed to agns , and a galactic extinction curve ( cardelli et al .",

    "the fitting is carried out for the several different metallicities ( from 0.02@xmath30 to 2.5@xmath30 ) to test if the results are robust in light of changing the metallicity .",
    "the fitting at extremely low metallicity ( i.e. , 0.02@xmath30 ) is excluded in the subsequent studies for sdss0900 + 3813 because a relatively high metallicity is required to reproduce the observed metal absorption lines .",
    "the fittings at the solar metallicity ( the base models , see below ) are illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the fraction of mass associated to each of the five instantaneous bursts used in our fitting .",
    "as shown in the figure , the modeling results at the different metallicities are highly consistent with each other . for sdssj1634 + 4619 and sdssj1026 + 1034",
    ", their spectra can be interpreted by the combination of an old stellar population ( @xmath31gyr ) and a younger one ( a few of 100myr ) .",
    "although there are uncertainties in the precise age estimates due to both metallicity effect and used models , a @xmath32myr and a @xmath33myr old young stellar populations are specifically required in sdssj1026 + 1034 and sdssj1634 + 4619 , respectively .",
    "in contrast , sdss0900 + 3813 is dominated by a relatively old stellar population ( @xmath34gyr ) , which is in agreement with its relatively weak h@xmath23 absorption feature that is already mentioned above .",

    "the hybrid qsos studied in this paper are clearly consistent with the @xmath2 sequence reported in the local seyfert galaxies , which implies that the evolution sequence could continue out to @xmath64 .",
    "note that the three hybrid qsos are located in the middle range of the evolutionary sequence , which implies that they are at the transition stage not only from young to old agns , but also from host - dominated to agn - dominated phase .",

    "the central agn activity is predicted to be heavily obscured by the surrounding gas and dust , especially in uv / optical bands .",
    "after the obscuration material is dispersed by the feedback from the accretion activity and emission from young , hot stars fades out ( i.e. , at about 1gyr after the beginning ) , luminous qsos are observable because the star light from host is overwhelmed by the strong radiation from the luminous qsos ( hopkins et al .",

    ", we could not entirely exclude the possibility that the lack of extremely young stellar population in our three hybrid qsos is caused by the used @xmath20 criterion ( i.e. , @xmath31 ) .",

    "we consequently conclude that the narrow emission lines in sdssj1026 + 1034 are mainly contributed from the central agn .",
    "the radio emission of sdssj1634 + 4619 is detected by the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; condon et al . 1998 ) and faint images of the radio sky survey at twenty cm ( first ) survey ( becker et al . 1995 ) at 1.4ghz .",

    "the average sfr of the latest burst is therefore estimated to be @xmath83 for sdssj1634 + 4619 .",
    "given the salpeter imf ( salpeter 1955 ) , the starburst - contributed radio luminosity is @xmath84 , which is one order of magnitude lower than the calculated total radio luminosity .",
    "it is widely accepted that galaxies interaction can trigger extreme nuclear accretion and star formation activity ( e.g. , toomre & toomre 1972 ; larson & tinsely 1978 ; sanders et al .",
    "1988 ; stockton 1999 ; heckman et al . 1984 ; di matteo et al . 2005 ; springel et al .",

    "recent _ hst acs deep imaging study identified significant fine structures such as shells and tidal tails in a small sample of host galaxies of low redshift qsos ( bennert et al .",
    "a companion galaxy at post - starburst phase ( @xmath85myr ) is identified in the particular case unj1025 - 0040 ( brotherton et al . 1999 ; canalizo et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the _ hst image shows an interacting companion for the `` q+a '' object sdssj231055 - 090107 ( canalizo et al .",
    "_ _    the optical images of sdssj1634 + 4619 taken by sdss show an unresolved source neighbored by a marginally detectable , very faint source to southwest in appearance .",
    "figure 5 shows the @xmath86-band image .",
    "the intensity contours are over - plotted on the image after the background level determined around the source is subtracted .",
    "to identify the faint companion more clearly , we project the image along the long sides of the two rectangles overlaid in figure 5 .",
    "figure 6 presents the count distributions along the two directions .",
    "as shown by the left panel in figure 6 , the peaks of sdssj1634 + 4619 and the possible companion are separated by about 8 pixels .",
    "this separation corresponds to a projected physical distance @xmath111kpc if the companion is at z=0.576 .",
    "finally , more deep spectroscopic observations and imagings are necessary to determine whether the companion interacts with sdssj1634 + 4619 physically or is just a foreground star / galaxy .",
    "we select 15 intermediate - z galaxies with hybrid spectra from sdss dr6 to study the issue of agn - host connection .",
    "the spectra redward of the balmer limit are dominated by starlight , and the spectra at blue end by both an agn continuum and a broad emission line .",
    "the spectra are analyzed in detail in three objects : sdssj162446.49 + 461946.7 , sdssj102633.32 + 103443.8 and sdssj090036.44 + 381353.0 . without intensive current star formation activities , the modeled recent",
    "burst ages range from @xmath1400myr to 1gyr . based on the -based black hole masses , the three hybrid qsos are consistent with the @xmath2 sequence previously established in local agns .",
    "we would like to thank the anonymous referee for very useful comments and important suggestions that improved the presentation .",
    "this search has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database , which is operated by jpl , caltech , under contract with the nasa .",
