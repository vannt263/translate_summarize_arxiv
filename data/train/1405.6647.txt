    "recent results from the lhc and direct dark matter detection experiments constrain considerably possible scenarios beyond the standard model ( sm ) , amongst others its supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions .",
    "these constraints originate essentially from the higgs mass  @xcite and its quite sm like signal rates , the absence of signals in searches for squarks and gluinos after the 8  tev run at the lhc  @xcite , and upper bounds on dark matter  nucleus cross sections from the lux experiment  @xcite .",
    "masses and couplings of higgs boson(s ) , susy particles and notably the lightest susy particle ( lsp , the dark matter candidate ) , are strongly correlated in susy extensions of the sm if one assumes at least partial unification of the soft susy breaking terms at a grand unification ( gut ) scale .",
    "hence it is interesting to study how the combined constraints affect the parameter space and , notably , which signals beyond the sm we can expect in the future .",
    "such studies ( after the discovery of the 126  gev higgs boson ) had been performed earlier in the minimal susy extension of the sm ( mssm )  @xcite and the next - to - minimal susy extension of the sm ( nmssm )  @xcite .",
    "these studies differ , however , in the treatment of the soft susy breaking terms in the higgs sector at the gut scale : in `` fully constrained '' versions of the mssm or nmssm these are supposed to be unified with the soft susy breaking terms in the squark and slepton sectors . in nuhm",
    "( non - universal higgs masses ) or `` semi - constrained '' versions of the mssm or nmssm one allows the soft susy breaking terms in the higgs sector to be different ; after all the quantum numbers of the higgs fields differ from those of quarks and leptons : higgs fields are in a real representation ( @xmath2 ) of su(2 ) , but do not fit into complete representations of su(5 ) ; these properties can easily have an impact on the presently unknown sources of soft susy breaking terms . in the nmssm",
    "including the singlet superfield @xmath3 , `` semi - constrained '' can indicate non - universal soft susy breaking terms involving the singlet only , or non - universal soft susy breaking terms involving su(2 ) doublet or singlet higgs fields . in the present study",
    "we allow for the latter more general case .",
    "previous studies of the nmssm with constraints at the gut scale  @xcite had found that wide ranges of parameter space comply with constraints from the lhc and on dark matter , and that less `` tuning '' is required than in the mssm  @xcite .",
    "these findings are confirmed by scans of the parameter space of the general nmssm ( without constraints at the gut scale )  @xcite , and motivate a thorough analysis of the semi - constrained nuh - nmssm with up - to - date experimental constraints , amongst others on higgs signal rates and bounds on dark matter  nucleus cross sections  @xcite .",
    "`` nuh '' appears without `` m '' since , apart from the higgs mass terms , also trilinear couplings involving higgs bosons only are allowed to differ from trilinear couplings involving squarks or sleptons at the gut scale , see the next section .",
    "using the code nmspec  @xcite within nmssmtools_4.2.1  @xcite together with micr @xcite we have sampled about 3.2  m viable points in the parameter space , which allows us to cover the complete range of masses and couplings of the lsp and additional higgs bosons , parts of which had not been observed in previous analyses . in this paper we confine ourselves to regions where an additional nmssm - specific higgs scalar is lighter than the sm - like higgs boson near 126  gev ; this region is strongly favoured by the mass of the sm - like higgs boson , and contains the most interesting phenomena to be searched for in the future .    in the next section we present the model , the applied phenomenological constraints , the definition of fine - tuning , and the ranges of parameters scanned over . in section  3 we discuss the impact of unsuccessful searches for squarks and gluinos at the lhc on fine - tuning and some of the parameters like the soft squark / slepton masses @xmath4",

    "we discuss the higgs sector , in particular prospects to detect the lighter nmssm specific higgs scalar . conclusions and",

    "one assumes that the soft susy breaking terms involving gauginos , squarks or sleptons are identical at the gut scale : [ eq:2.6 ] m_1 = m_2 = m_3 m_1/2 , [ eq:2.7 ] m_^2= m_^2=m_^2= m_^2=m_^2m_0 ^ 2 , [ eq:2.8 ] a_t = a_b = a_a_0 .    in the nuh - nmssm",
    "considered here one allows the higgs sector to play a special role : the higgs soft mass terms @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are allowed to differ from @xmath31 ( and determined implicitely at the weak scale by the three minimization equations of the effective potential ) , and the trilinear couplings @xmath32 , @xmath33 can differ from @xmath34 .",

    "the application of constraints from unsuccessful searches for sparticles at the first run of the lhc is more delicate : these bounds depend on all parameters of the model via the masses and couplings ( and the resulting decay cascades ) of all sparticles . however , it is possible to proceed as follows , using the most constraining searches for gluinos and squarks of the first generation in events with jets and missing @xmath53 : for heavy squarks and/or gluinos the production cross sections are so small that these points in parameter space are not excluded independently of the squark / gluino decay cascades . on the other hand , relatively light squarks and/or gluinos",
