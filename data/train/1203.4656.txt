    "during past decade , fluorescence of molecules placed near a metal nanostructure supporting surface plasmon ( sp ) has attracted renewed interest due to biosensing applications.@xcite while early studies mainly focused on fluorescence near rough metal films , @xcite more recent advances in near - field optics and in chemical control of molecule - nanostructure complexes spurred a number of fluorescence measurements from dye molecules and semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) linked to metal nanoparticles ( np).@xcite fluorescence quantum efficiency of such conjugate systems is determined by competition between strong local field enhancement of molecule s dipole moment near sp resonance@xcite and , hence , of radiative decay rate @xmath2 , and nonradiative energy transfer from excited dipole to optically - inactive electronic excitations in the metal characterized by nonradiative decay rate @xmath3.@xcite the interplay between these two mechanisms depends on separation , @xmath0 , of the emitter from the metal surface.@xcite as a result , fluorescence is enhanced at some optimal @xmath0 and is quenched close to np due to the suppression of quantum efficiency , @xmath4 , by non - radiative processes . both enhancement and quenching",
    "were widely observed in fluorescence experiments on au and ag nanoparticles.@xcite    when a dipole with excitation energy @xmath5 is situated near a spherical np of radius @xmath6 its energy is transferred to via coulomb interactions to electronic excitations in np ( single - particle or collective ) with angular momentum @xmath7 . within classical approach,@xcite",
    "these are collective modes described by resonances of np @xmath7-pole dynamic polarizabilities @xmath8 expressed in terms of _ local _ dielectric function @xmath9 , i.e. , bulk metal dielectric function @xmath10 for @xmath11 and dielectric constant of outside medium @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "the energy dissipation in np is then determined by @xmath14 which comes mainly from electron - phonon interactions and , for high @xmath5 , from optical transitions between d - band and sp - band .",
    "the distance dependence of energy transfer rate @xmath3 stems from electromagnetic interaction of molecular dipole with its image that , at small @xmath0 ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) , yields@xcite @xmath16 , similar to flat metal surface.@xcite recent fluorescence measurements from molecules near ( but not very close to ) relatively large ( tens of nm ) nps @xcite indicated a good agreement with classical electromagnetic models.@xcite    with decreasing distance between dipole and metal surface , the energy transfer rate gets significantly modified due to spatial dispersion of @xmath17 . for @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is fermi velocity , the high fourier harmonics of dipole s coulomb potential are no longer screened by conduction electrons in the metal so that the phase space restriction on excitation of electron - hole pairs over fermi level is lifted.@xcite for small @xmath0 , electron - hole generation becomes the dominant energy transfer mechanism that leads to a sharper distance dependence of energy transfer rate , @xmath20 ; the precise coefficient calculated within random phase approximation ( rpa ) differs in the literature.@xcite    while fluorescence quenching from a molecule near a relatively large np is essentially similar to that near flat metal surface,@xcite the energy transfer to _ small _ nps is significantly modified due to quantum - size effects .",
    "fluorescence near nanometer - sized au nps with diameter as small as 1.4 nm has attracted significant interest due to their large surface to volume ratio and , hence , lower ohmic losses , which is important for biosensing applications.@xcite for such nps , a spillover of a substantial fraction of electron density beyond np classical radius can significantly affect spatial dispersion of metal dielectric function @xcite and hence modify the dipole coulomb potential near np surface .",
    "the presence of strongly localized d - band with abrupt nearly classical density profile gives rise to a surface layer where coulomb potential is not screened by interband transitions.@xcite in small nps , the size - dependent landau damping of plasmons excited by the molecular dipole can increase the rate of energy dissipation.@xcite incorporation of all the above effects in a single model requires a microscopic approach of energy transfer rates near small nps .    in this paper , we present such a microscopic model , based on time - dependent local density approximation ( tdlda ) , for calculation of radiative and nonradiative decay rates of a molecular dipole near a small noble metal np . here",
    ", the molecule is represented by a point - like dipole while we focus on non - local and quantum - size effects in dielectric function of nanometer - sized metal np . to this end , we adopt quantum three - region model we developed recently@xcite that accounts for different density profiles of sp - band and d - band electrons @xcite in small noble metal np embedded in a dielectric medium .",
    "we find that calculated radiative decay rates , @xmath2 , are not significantly affected by non - local effects and are comparable to those calculated using semiclassical approaches@xcite with quantum corrections . at the same time , the energy transfer rate @xmath3 is significantly enhanced due to the generation of electron - hole pairs in metal at small molecule - np separations .",
    "we find , however , that quantum - size and non - local effects strongly affect the distance dependence of @xmath3 close to np surface and that @xmath1 behavior no longer holds ; namely , the energy transfer rate is significantly slower than that predicted by rpa calculations.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : dipole ] we set up the expressions for decay rates to be evaluated and derive the classical limit . in section [ sec : tdlda ] we outline the quantum three - region model used for evaluation of np polarizabilities . in section [ sec : numeric ] our numerical results are presented and discussed , and section [ sec : conc ] concludes the paper .",
