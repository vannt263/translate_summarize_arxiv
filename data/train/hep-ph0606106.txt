    "gauge theories on spaces with noncommuting coordinates , @xmath2=i\\,\\theta^{\\mu\\nu } \\ , \\ ] ] provide a very interesting new class of quantum field theories with intriguing and sometimes unexpected features .",
    "these noncommutative models can arise naturally as low - energy effective theories from string theory and d - branes . as field theories",
    "they must satisfy a number of restrictive constraints detailed below , and this makes them particularly interesting and challenging for purposes of particle physics model building . for general reviews of noncommutative gauge theories",
    "the reader can consult e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are two distinct approaches used in the recent literature for constructing quantum field theories on noncommutative spaces .",
    "the first approach uses the weyl - moyal star - products to introduce noncommutativity . in this case ,",
    "noncommutative field theories are defined by replacing the ordinary products of all fields in the lagrangians of their commutative counterparts by the star - products @xmath3 noncommutative theories in the weyl - moyal formalism can be viewed as field theories on ordinary commutative spacetime .",
    "for example , the noncommutative pure gauge theory action is @xmath4 where the commutator in the field strength also contains the star - product .",
    "the important feature of this approach is the fact that phase factors in the star - products are not expanded in powers of @xmath5 and the @xmath5 dependence in the lagrangian is captured entirely .",
    "this ability to work to all orders in @xmath5 famously gives rise to the ultraviolet / infrared ( uv / ir ) mixing  @xcite in the noncommutative quantum field theory which we will review below .",
    "the second indirect approach to noncommutativity does not employ star - products .",
    "it instead relies @xcite on the seiberg - witten map which represents noncommutative fields as a function of @xmath5 and ordinary commutative fields .",
    "this approach essentially reduces noncommutativity to an introduction of an infinite set of higher - dimensional ( irrelevant ) operators , each suppressed by the corresponding power of @xmath5 , into the action .",
    "there are two main differences compared to the weyl - moyal approach .",
    "first , in practice one always works with the first few terms in the power series in @xmath5 and in this setting the uv / ir mixing can not be captured .",
    "second , the seiberg - witten map is a non - linear field transformation .",
    "therefore , one expects a non - trivial jacobian and possibly a quantum theory different from the one obtained in the weyl - moyal approach . in this paper",
    "we will use the original direct formulation of the theory on a noncommutative space in terms of the weyl - moyal star product .    in the context of weyl - moyal noncommutative standard model building ,",
    "a number of features of noncommutative gauge theories have to be taken into account which are believed to be generic  @xcite :    1 .   the mixing of ultraviolet and infrared effects  @xcite and the asymptotic decoupling of u(1 ) degrees of freedom  @xcite in the infrared ; 2 .",
    "the gauge groups are restricted to u(@xmath6 ) groups  @xcite or products of thereof ; 3 .",
    "fields can transform only in ( anti-)fundamental , bi - fundamental and adjoint representations  @xcite ; 4 .",
    "the charges of matter fields are restricted  @xcite to @xmath7 and @xmath8 , thus requiring extra care in order to give fractional electric charges to the quarks .",
    "building upon an earlier proposal by chaichian _",
    "@xcite , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite constructed an example of a noncommutative embedding of the standard model with the purpose to satisfy all the requirements listed above .",
    "the model of @xcite is based on the gauge group @xmath9 with matter fields transforming in noncommutatively allowed representations .",
    "higgs fields break the noncommutative gauge group down to a low - energy commutative gauge theory which includes the standard model group @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath11 group here corresponds to ordinary qed , or more precisely to the hypercharge @xmath12 abelian gauge theory .",
    "the generator of @xmath11 was constructed from a linear combination of _ traceless _ diagonal generators of the microscopic theory @xmath13 because of this , the uv / ir effects  which can affect only the overall trace-@xmath14 subgroup of each @xmath15  were not contributing to the hypercharge @xmath16 however some of the overall trace-@xmath17 degrees of freedom can survive the higgs mechanism and thus contribute to the low - energy effective theory , in addition to the standard model fields .",
    "these additional trace-@xmath14 gauge fields logarithmically decouple from the low - energy effective theory and were neglected in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite . here , we take these effects into account",
    ".    we will find that the noncommutative model building constraints , and , specifically , the uv / ir mixing effects in the trace - u(1 ) factors in the item 1 above , lead to an unacceptable defective behavior of the low - energy theory , when we try to construct a model having the photon as the only massless colourless u(1 ) gauge boson .",
    "our findings pose extremely severe constraints on such models effectively ruling them out .",
    "one way out is to modify some of the assumptions .",
    "we will discuss the introduction of universal extradimensions and modifications of the noncommutative field theory at very high energy scales .",
    "the uv / ir mixing in noncommutative theories arises from the fact that certain classes of feynman diagrams acquire factors of the form @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is an external momentum and @xmath20 is a loop momentum ) compared to their commutative counter - parts .",
    "these factors directly follow from the use of the weyl - moyal star - product ( [ stardef ] ) . at large values of the loop momentum @xmath20 , the oscillations of @xmath18",
    "improve the convergence of the loop integrals .",
    "however , as the external momentum vanishes , @xmath21 the divergence reappears and what would have been a uv divergence is now reinterpreted as an ir divergence instead .",
    "this phenomenon of uv / ir mixing is specific to noncommutative theories and does not occur in the commutative settings where the physics of high energy degrees of freedom does not affect the physics at low energies .",
    "there are two important points concerning the uv / ir mixing  @xcite which we want to stress here .",
    "first , the uv / ir mixing occurs only in the trace - u(1 ) components of the noncommutative @xmath22 theory , leaving the @xmath23 degrees of freedom unaffected .",
    "second , there are two separate sources of the uv / ir mixing contributing to the dispersion relation of the trace - u(1 ) gauge fields : the @xmath24 effects and the @xmath25 effects , as will be explained momentarily .",
    "a study of the wilsonian effective action , obtained by integrating out the high - energy degrees of freedom using the background field method , and keeping track of the uv / ir mixing effects , has given strong hints in favour of a non - universality in the infrared  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the polarisation tensor of the gauge bosons in a noncommutative @xmath22 gauge theory takes a form  @xcite @xmath26 here @xmath27 are adjoint labels of @xmath22 gauge fields , @xmath28 , such that @xmath29 correspond to the overall @xmath14 subgroup , i.e. to the trace - u(1 ) factor .",
    "the term in ( [ poltensor ] ) proportional to @xmath30 would not appear in ordinary commutative theories .",
    "it is transverse , but not lorentz invariant , as it explicitly depends on @xmath31 nevertheless it is perfectly allowed in noncommutative theories .",
    "it is known that @xmath25 vanishes for supersymmetric noncommutative gauge theories with unbroken supersymmetry , as was first discussed in @xcite .    in general , both @xmath24 and @xmath25 terms in ( [ poltensor ] )",
    "are affected by the uv / ir mixing .",
    "more precisely , as already mentioned earlier , the uv / ir mixing affects specifically the @xmath32 components and generates the @xmath33 components in ( [ poltensor ] ) .",
    "the uv / ir mixing in @xmath32 affects the running of the trace - u(1 ) coupling constant in the infrared . for a pure noncommutative gauge theory in 4 continuous dimensions",
    "one finds , @xmath34 leading to a logarithmic decoupling of the trace - u(1 ) gauge fields from the @xmath23 low - energy theory , see refs .",
    "@xcite for more detail .    for nonsupersymmetric theories , @xmath33 can present more serious problems . in theories without supersymmetry ,",
    "@xmath35 at small momenta , and this leads to unacceptable quadratic ir singularities @xcite . in theories with softly broken supersymmetry ( i.e. with matching number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom ) the quadratic singularities in @xmath33 cancel  @xcite .",
    "however , the subleading contribution @xmath36 survives @xcite unless the supersymmetry is exact . for the rest of the paper we will concentrate on noncommutative standard model candidates with softly broken supersymmetry , in order to avoid quadratic ir divergencies . in this case",
    ", @xmath37 is a measure of susy breaking . ] as explained in @xcite .",
    "the presence of such @xmath25 effects will lead to unacceptable pathologies such as lorentz - noninvariant dispersion relations giving mass to only one of the polarisations of the trace - u(1 ) gauge field , leaving the other polarisation massless .",
    "the presence of the uv / ir effects in the trace - u(1 ) factors makes it pretty clear that a simple noncommutative u(1 ) theory taken on its own has nothing to do with ordinary qed .",
    "the low - energy theory emerging from the noncommutative u(1 ) theory will become free at @xmath38 ( rather than just weakly coupled ) and in addition will have other pathologies  @xcite .",
    "however , one would expect that it is conceivable to embed a commutative @xmath23 theory , such as e.g. qcd or the weak sector of the standard model into a supersymmetric noncommutative theory in the uv , but some extra care should be taken with the qed u(1 ) sector  @xcite .",
    "we will show that the only realistic way to embed qed into noncommutative settings is to recover the electromagnetic u(1 ) from a _ traceless _ diagonal generator of some higher @xmath22 gauge theory .",
    "so it seems that in order to embed qed into a noncommutative theory one should learn how to embed the whole standard model  @xcite .",
    "we will see , however , that the additional trace - u(1 ) factors remaining from the noncommutative @xmath22 groups will make the resulting low - energy theories unviable ( for the 4 dimensional models considered in the first half of this paper ) .    in order to proceed",
    "we would like to disentangle the mass - effects due to the higgs mechanism from the mass - effects due to non - vanishing @xmath39 hence we first set @xmath40 ( this can be achieved by starting with an exactly supersymmetric theory ) .",
    "it is then straightforward to show ( see @xcite ) that the higgs mechanism alone can not remove all of the trace - u(1 ) factors from the massless theory .",
    "more precisely , the following statement is true : _ consider a scenario where a set of fundamental , bifundamental and adjoint higgs fields breaks @xmath41 such that @xmath42 is non - trivial . then there is at least one generator of the unbroken subgroup @xmath42 with _ non - vanishing trace_. this generator can be chosen such that it generates a u(1 ) subgroup .",
    "_    we can now count all the massless u(1 ) factors in a generic noncommutative theory with @xmath40 and after the higgs symmetry breaking .",
    "in general we can have the following scenarios for massless u(1 ) degrees of freedom in @xmath42 :    1 .",
    "[ possa]@xmath43 is traceless and in addition there is one or more factors of trace - u(1 ) in @xmath42 .",
    "[ possb ] @xmath43 arises from a mixture of traceless and trace - u(1 ) generators of the noncommutative product group @xmath44 3 .",
    "[ possc ] @xmath43 has an admixture of trace - u(1 ) generators as in ( [ possb ] ) plus there are additional massless trace - u(1 ) factors in @xmath42 .    in the following sections we will see that none of these options lead to an acceptable low - energy theory once we have switched on @xmath45 , i.e. once we have introduced mass differences between superpartners .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that @xmath45 leads to strong lorentz symmetry violating effects in the dispersion relation of the corresponding trace - u(1 ) vector bosons , and in particular , to mass - difference of their helicity components .",
    "if option ( [ possa ] ) was realised in nature , it would lead ( in addition to the standard photon ) to a new colourless vector field with one polarisation being massless , and one massive due to @xmath39    the options ( b ) and ( c ) are also not viable since an admixture of the trace - u(1 ) generators to the photon would also perversely affect photon polarisations and make some of them massive .",
    "in the rest of this note we will explain these observations in more detail .",
    "we end this section with some general comments on noncommutative standard modelling . in an earlier analysis @xcite the trace - u(1 )",
    "factors were assumed to be completely decoupled in the extreme infrared and , hence , were neglected .",
    "however , it is important to keep in mind that the decoupling of the trace - u(1 ) s is logarithmic and hence slow . for a 4 dimensional continuum theory one finds that even in presence of a huge hierarchy between the noncommutative mass scale @xmath46 , say of the order of the planck scale @xmath47 , and the scale @xmath48 ( electroweak and qcd scale , respectively ) , where the su(@xmath6 ) subgroup becomes strong , the ratio @xmath49 is not negligible . in particular , the above inequality holds for any @xmath50 .",
    "hence , the complete decoupling of the trace - u(1 ) degrees of freedom at small non - zero momenta does not appear to be fully justified and the trace - u(1 ) would leave its traces in scattering experiments at accessible momentum scales @xmath51 ( see sect . 2 for more detail ) .",
    "however , eq . ( [ ration1 ] ) already gives us a hint how one can avoid that the trace - u(1 ) s leave observable traces .",
    "the logarithms in eq .",
    "( [ ration1 ] ) are a typical property of the 4 dimensional theory . adding universal extra dimensions ( where gauge fields can propagate into the extra dimensions )",
    "one expects that one gets a much faster power like decoupling .",
    "we will explore this possibility in in sect .",
    "[ powerlaw ] .",
    "finally , starting from the original motivation from string theory another possibility to avoid the conclusions stated above presents itself .",
    "viewed as originating from string theory , the noncommutative field theory is only a low energy limit . at very high",
    "scales the noncommutative field theory is not necessarily a good description anymore .",
    "we discuss a simple ( but not too unreasonable ) modification and study its consequences in sect .",
    "[ birefringence ] .",
    "uv / ir mixing manifests itself only in the trace - u(1 ) part of the full noncommutative u(@xmath6 ) . for this part it strongly affects @xmath52 and",
    "is responsible for the generation of nonvanishing @xmath53 ( if susy is not exact ) . in this section",
    "we will briefly review how the uv / ir mixing arises in the trace - u(1 ) sector and how this leads us to rule out options ( a ) and ( c ) discussed in sect .  1 .",

    "gauge and lorentz invariance restrict the lorentz structure to be identical to the one of the tree level term .",

    "( [ poltensor ] )",

    "let us start with a discussion of the effects noncommutativity has on @xmath52 and the running of the gauge coupling .",

    "hence , this rules out possibilities ( [ possb ] ) and ( [ possc ] ) from the introduction .",
    "in the introduction we already mentioned that a possible way out of the dilemma with the trace - u(1 ) s is the introduction of universal extra dimensions .",
    "let us now investigate this option .    in most of the following discussion",
    "we will adopt a four - dimensional point of view in describing extra - dimensional theories .",
    "that is , because we are interested in renormalisation group effects associated with the 4-dimensional momentum , it makes more sense to include the effects of extra dimensions by considering the effect of a simple kaluza - klein tower of states .",
    "( in the uv - complete string models there are other effects which , at one - loop order and in compact dimensions significantly larger than the string length , will be secondary . )",
    "intuitively it is obvious that the main factor affecting the running of the gauge couplings will be the noncommutativity parameter @xmath124 , and in particular how it mixes the additional ( compact ) dimensions with the ordinary four large dimensions . we will now give a somewhat heuristic presentation of how @xmath124 affects the running of the gauge couplings . a more precise and general calculation is given in @xcite and we will just quote the results from there in the last part of this section .",
    "let us start by briefly reviewing power law running in the uv at scales well above the compactification scale . in the uv regime",
    "the planar diagrams dominate the two point function and so there is no difference to the ordinary commutative case ( see @xcite ) . because of this it is sufficient to use an intuitive approach based on thresholds .",
    "consider first the most simple case of one compact extra dimension of size @xmath163 .",
    "neglecting threshold effects the one loop running of the gauge coupling in four dimensions typically follows ( @xmath164 ) @xmath165 where the @xmath166 are coefficients depending on the spin and representation of the particle @xmath167 . in the sum only particles with mass @xmath168 smaller than the momentum scale @xmath169 contribute ( in any suitable massive renormalisation scheme ) .",
    "this leads to the typical decoupling of massive modes . for simplicity ,",
    "let us now consider a situation where all particles have ( approximately ) the same mass @xmath170 .",
    "we find @xmath171 where we have chosen the sign of the constant @xmath172 such that it is positive when the theory is asymptotically free .",
    "( for example , in @xmath173 supersymmetric pure gauge theory @xmath174 in this notation . )    above the compactification scale , more precisely at @xmath175 , the first kaluza - klein mode gives an identical contribution to the @xmath176-function , and in general one finds @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the number of kaluza - klein modes ( including the zero mode ) contributing at the scale @xmath19 .",
    "since the mass of the @xmath179th kaluza - klein mode is given by @xmath180 one easily finds the approximate formula @xmath181 where we have introduced the constant @xmath182 to account for the details of the compactification and threshold effects .",

    "yields the flow equation for @xmath191 , @xmath192 if we start at small values for @xmath188 the coupling increases toward the infrared until it reaches a fixed point at @xmath193 .",
    "the corresponding coupling of the 4-dimensional theory is then @xmath194 in agreement with the last equation in ( [ flow ] ) .",
    "this discussion implies that power - law running in extra dimensions originates from a fixed point in the effective higher - dimensional coupling constant @xmath188 .",
    "this implies that the power - law running of @xmath195 is a strong coupling phenomenon in terms of @xmath188 and one should exercise caution since eqs .",
    "( [ flow ] ) and ( [ rescaled ] ) are one - loop results . in particular",
    "a large number of extra - dimensions increases the value of the fixed point coupling and the approximation may break down .",
    "the issues of existence of a fixed point of @xmath188 were investigated in literature on extra - dimensional gauge theories , see e.g. @xcite .    from now on we will continue assuming that ( ordinary commutative ) extra - dimensional gauge theories do provide a power - law running of the coupling in the extreme ultraviolet ( i.e. at energies well above the compactification scale ) . we will then show that in noncommutative settings the mixing between ultraviolet and infrared degrees of freedom will induce in the extreme infrared a power - law decoupling of the trace - u(1 ) degrees of freedom .      as specified in eq .",

    "in fact , the coupling depends only on the absolute values @xmath153 as well as @xmath197 , as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ pi11 ] ) and ( [ pi12 ] ) .",
    "since we are mostly interested in low - energy physics ( compared to the compactification scale ) the effects of extra dimensions can contribute only through loops in perturbation theory .",

    "( [ irrun ] ) one can see that in general noncommutative theory when we lower momentum - scale @xmath169 sufficiently , even very massive modes start to contribute .",

    "the enhancement by the @xmath208 factor gives the _ power - like _ decoupling of these unwanted degrees of freedom from the su(@xmath6 ) theory ( which is unaffected by the uv / ir mixing effects ) .",
    "if the matrix @xmath99 has nonvanishing entries that mix the ordinary four dimensions with the extra dimensions we may have a non - vanishing @xmath209 in the calculation of the polarisation tensor this leads to phase factors in the sum over the kaluza - klein modes , @xmath210 ( in addition to the usual @xmath5-dependent phases in non - planar contributions ) .",
    "in this situation it is advantageous to directly perform the sum over kaluza - klein modes in the polarisation tensor .",

    "this equation is valid for @xmath216 with @xmath46 still defined as @xmath217 .",
    "the fact that the actual running is now given by replacing the 4-dimensional components of @xmath124 with the total @xmath218 is not too surprising since the infrared running comes from very ultraviolet modes , i.e. it involves momenta much higher than the compactification scale where the theory is effectively higher - dimensional . at these scales",
    "there is no distinction between the ordinary four dimensions and the extra dimensions .",
    "( [ resultshort ] ) has the additional advantage that it already corresponds to the integrated result .",

    "@xmath222 is a renormalisation constant determined from the bare coupling and the planar diagrams only .",
    "therefore in the regime ( [ regimelow ] ) this constant is connected to the gauge coupling of the su(@xmath6)-part ( up to logarithmic corrections which we neglected in our approximation ) @xmath223      in noncommutative field theories the gauge coupling is not the only part of the polarisation tensor that is affected by power law running .",
    "recall that in noncommutative field theories the ( 4-dimensional ) polarisation tensor has an additional lorentz symmetry violating part @xcite , which is called @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ poltensor ] ) .    for softly broken supersymmetry only the ir - singular ( pole )",

    "therefore , if we have compactified extra dimensions , we must include the kaluza - klein modes , effectively multiplying the four - dimensional @xmath225 by the number of kaluza - klein modes .",
    "the number of contributing kaluza - klein modes is , again , given roughly by @xmath226 of eq .",
    "( [ flowir ] ) .",

    "we found in sect .",
    "[ massec ] that the lorentz violating mass term for the trace - u(1 ) factors remains roughly constant . hence trace - u(1 ) s are still unsuitable as photon candidates . with a similar argument as in sect .",
    "[ u2example ] one finds that this also holds for mixtures of trace and traceless parts .",
    "therefore a suitable photon candidate must be constructed ( as in four dimensions ) from an unbroken combination of traceless generators . in @xcite",
    "we found that such a combination can only exist together with additional unbroken u(1 ) s which have nonvanishing trace .",
    "here the results of sect .",
    "[ powerlaw ] help us , since they allow for a fast decoupling of trace - u(1 ) degrees of freedom .",

    "<S> restrictions imposed by gauge invariance in noncommutative spaces together with the effects of ultraviolet / infrared mixing lead to strong constraints on possible candidates for a noncommutative extension of the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> we study a general class of noncommutative models consistent with these restrictions . specifically we consider models based upon a gauge theory with the gauge group @xmath0 coupled to matter fields transforming in the ( anti)-fundamental , bi - fundamental and adjoint representations . </S>",
    "<S> we pay particular attention to overall trace - u(1 ) factors of the gauge group which are affected by the ultraviolet / infrared mixing . </S>",
    "<S> typically , these trace - u(1 ) gauge fields do not decouple sufficiently fast in the infrared , and lead to sizable lorentz symmetry violating effects in the low - energy effective theory . in a 4-dimensional theory on a continuous space - time making these effects </S>",
    "<S> unobservable would require making the effects of noncommutativity tiny , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this severely limits the phenomenological prospects of such models . </S>",
    "<S> however , adding additional universal extra dimensions the trace - u(1 ) factors decouple with a power law and the constraint on the noncommutativity scale is weakened considerably . finally , we briefly mention some interesting properties of the photon that could arise if the noncommutative theory is modified at a high energy scale .    </S>",
