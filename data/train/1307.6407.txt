    "anomalous diffusion of the power - law form @xcite @xmath0 of the mean squared displacement ( msd ) has been observed in a wide variety of systems . depending on the value of the anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath1 we distinguish subdiffusion ( @xmath2 ) and superdiffusion ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the special cases are that of normal brownian motion ( @xmath4 ) and wave - like , ballistic motion ( @xmath5 ) .    examples for subdiffusion include the anomalous motion of charge carriers in amorphous semiconductors @xcite , the motion of tracer beads in polymer melts @xcite and actin networks @xcite , the dynamics of sticky particles along a surface @xcite , or the spreading of tracer chemicals in subsurface hydrology @xcite .",
    "superdiffusion is observed in weakly chaotic systems @xcite , in bulk - surface exchange controlled dynamics in porous glasses @xcite , or for the motion of tracer beads in wormlike micellar solutions @xcite .",
    "in particular , numerous cases of anomalous diffusion have been reported for the motion of endogenous and artificial submicron tracers in living biological cells , following substantial advances in single particle tracking and spectroscopic tools over the last decade or so @xcite .",
    "thus , methods such as video tracking , tracking by optical tweezers , or fluorescence correlation spectroscopy have become routine tools to explore the motion of tracers such as larger biomolecules or microbeads in vivo . the anomalous diffusion of submicron - sized tracers is of interest for the understanding of biochemical processes in the cell , but also offers insight into the mechanical properties of the intracellular fluid and cellular mechanical structures as the passive or active tracer motion represents the basis for microrheology @xcite .",
    "examples for in vivo subdiffusion include the motion of endogenous granules ( lipids or insulin ) @xcite , of fluorescently labelled rna molecules @xcite , of the tips ( telomeres ) of eukaryotic dna and loci of bacterial dna @xcite , microbeads @xcite , viruses @xcite , pigment organelles @xcite , or of small proteins @xcite .",
    "potassium channels resident in the plasma membranes of living cells were shown to subdiffuse @xcite , as well as the motion of membrane proteins in the golgi membrane @xcite . in simulations ,",
    "subdiffusion of lipid and protein molecules in bilayers and monolayers was observed @xcite .",
    "superdiffusion in living cells is observed for motor - driven transport of viruses @xcite , microbeads @xcite , as well as magnetic endosomes @xcite .",
    "these experimental observations of anomalous diffusion have been modelled theoretically in terms of different generalised stochastic processes @xcite .",
    "the most popular models include obstructed ( coralled ) diffusion @xcite that leads to a turnover between free diffusion and a thermal plateau value .",
    "transiently , this process can be fitted with the law ( [ msd ] ) .",
    "continuous time random walks @xcite are based on random walk processes , in which the pausing time between successive jumps is power - law distributed such that no characteristic time scale exists , leading to anomalous diffusion of the form ( [ msd ] ) . in an external potential or in the presence of non - trivial boundary conditions this continuous time random walk process",
    "is conveniently described in terms of the fractional fokker - planck equation @xcite .",
    "the resulting motion of subdiffusive continuous time random walks in intrinsically noisy environments was recently studied @xcite .",
    "fractional brownian motion @xcite and the closely related fractional langevin equation @xcite are driven by gaussian noise , which is long - ranged correlated in time , again leading to behaviour ( [ msd ] ) . in the subdiffusive regime these two correlated gaussian processes are intimately connected with a viscoelastic environment @xcite .",
    "some of their properties are shared with scaled brownian motion @xcite .",
    "the law ( [ msd ] ) is also effected by the geometrical constraints imposed to a particle diffusing on a support with a fractal dimension @xcite .",
    "superdiffusion is modelled in terms of fractional brownian motion or lvy walks @xcite , a class of continuous time random walks with spatiotemporal coupling .    above theoretical approaches",
    "are based on the assumption that the environment is homogeneous and isotropic , or that over the relevant time and length scales of the measurement spatial variations of the environment in some sense are averaged out .",
    "yet there are clear indications that in biological cells the environment effects strong variations of the local diffusion constant .",
    "thus , maps of the local cytoplasmic diffusion coefficient in bacterial @xcite and eukaryotic @xcite cells indeed demonstrate substantial spatial variations .",
    "significant changes of the diffusivity along the trajectory of single tracer particles in cells may also be affected by transient binding as well as the abundance of biochemical energy supply and transcription activity in different compartments of eukaryotic nuclei @xcite .",
    "descriptions in terms of space - dependent diffusion coefficients @xmath6 are in fact widely used in hydrological applications to mesoscopically describe diffusion in heterogenous porous media @xcite . in particular , inhomogeneous versions of continuous time random walk models for water permeation in porous ground layers were developed recently @xcite .",
    "mathematically , spatially and temporally varying diffusivities give rise to anomalous sub- and superdiffusion in a range of stochastic models , compare refs .  @xcite .",
    "in particular , richardson type diffusion in turbulent media was modelled in terms of heterogeneous diffusion processes ( hdps ) @xcite . power - law forms for @xmath6 were proposed to capture the diffusion of a particle on a fractal support @xcite , yet , as shown below , this approach gives rise to weakly non - ergodic motion and is inherently different from the ergodic motion on fractals @xcite .",
    "the weakly non - ergodic properties of hdps were studied recently @xcite .    here",
    "we analyse in detail the motion of a diffusing particle subjected to a space - dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath6 , for the cases of exponential , power - law , and logarithmic @xmath7-dependencies .",
    "we demonstrate that these processes effect anomalous diffusion of the form ( [ msd ] ) of both sub- and superdiffusive forms as well as an ultraslow , logarithmic time dependence .",
    "moreover , we show that despite their description in terms of a time local diffusion equation , these processes exhibit a weak ergodicity breaking in the sense that the time and ensemble averaged msd do not converge , even in the long time limit , see below .",
    "our study reveals that the dynamics of the diffusing particle may crucially depend on its initial position , and that the time averaged msd may exhibit a splitting of the entire population of diffusing particles into faster and slower fractions .    in the following section we briefly review the properties of weak ergodicity violation of stochastic processes .",
    "section [ model ] introduces the hdp process in detail . in sections [ sec - power ] to [ sec - log ] we investigate the power - law , exponential , and logarithmic dependence of @xmath6 .",
    "finally , in section [ sec - out ] we draw our conclusions and present a brief outlook .",
    "commonly we characterise a stochastic process in terms of the ensemble averaged msd ( [ msd ] ) defined through the spatial average of @xmath8 , @xmath9 over the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath10 to find the particle at position @xmath7 at time @xmath11 . an alternative way to calculate",
    "the msd is via the time average @xmath12 over the time series @xmath13 , whose length is @xmath14 . in the time",

    "even when @xmath14 remains finite , a similar equivalence is obtained between the ensemble averaged msd ( [ msd ] ) and the time averaged msd @xmath18 , once we additionally average over a sufficiently large number of individual trajectories @xcite , @xmath19    once the process is non - stationary , the integral kernel @xmath20 ^ 2 $ ] will depend on both @xmath16 and @xmath11 , and the equivalence between ensemble and time averaged msds will break down , a phenomenon called weak ergodicity breaking @xcite . in particular , subdiffusive continuous time random walk processes exhibit the linear lag time dependence @xmath21 , contrasting the power - law form ( [ msd ] ) of the corresponding ensemble average @xcite . under confinement",
    ", @xmath22 converges to a plateau , whose value is defined in terms of the second moment of the corresponding boltzmann distribution , while the time average scales with @xmath16 as @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "concurrently , subdiffusive continuous time random walk processes age in the sense that physical observables described by this process explicitly depend on the time separation between initial system preparation and start of the measurement @xcite .",
    "the linear scaling of the time averaged msd is also observed for correlated @xcite and ageing @xcite continuous time random walks , while their respective ensemble averaged msds scale like eq .",
    "( [ msd ] ) or logarithmically in time .",
    "superdiffusive continuous time random walk processes of the lvy walk type exhibit an ultraweak violation of ergodicity in the sense that time and ensemble averaged msd only differ by a constant factor @xcite .    below",
    "we show a new variant of weak ergodicity breaking , namely , that under certain initial conditions the time averaged msd may scale like the square root of the lag time , @xmath24 , while the ensemble average exhibits the ultraslow scaling @xmath25 .",
    "do all anomalous diffusion processes give rise to weakly ergodic behaviour ?",
    "in fact , there exists ergodic subdiffusive motion .",
    "one example is the motion on a fractal support @xcite .",
    "another example is that of unbiased fractional brownian motion and the motion described by the fractional langevin equation , both reaching algebraically the ergodic behaviour @xcite .",
    "however , when a particle described by fractional brownian or fractional langevin equation motion is confined , transiently non - ergodic behaviour is observed , and the exponential relaxation to the thermal value of the ensemble averaged msd is replaced by an algebraically slow relaxation in the time averaged msd @xcite .    how can different anomalous stochastic processes be identified based on recorded single particle tracking data ? during the recent years several complementary methods have been presented @xcite .",
    "the use of multiple , complementary diagnosis tools simultaneously is of particular importance .",
    "for instance , when we analyse the velocity autocorrelation function , its shape appears almost identical for fractional brownian motion and confined subdiffusive continuous time random walks @xcite . among the applied methods are the first passage behaviour @xcite , the mean maximal excursion method @xcite , analysis of the fractal dimension of the trajectory @xcite , ratios of higher order moments @xcite , the distribution function of amplitude scatter between different trajectories @xcite , p - variation methods @xcite , and others @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the hdp model for anomalous diffusion .",
    "we explicitly define the process and briefly introduce the quantities used to analyse the special cases for the spatial variation of the diffusion coefficient @xmath6 investigated in the following sections , namely , power - law , exponential , and logarithmic dependencies on @xmath7 .",
    "we start with the stochastic langevin equation for the displacement @xmath13 of a particle diffusing in the absence of an external potential in a medium with the position - dependent diffusivity @xmath6 , namely@xmath26 here , @xmath27 represents a gaussian white ( @xmath28-correlated ) noise with unit norm @xmath29 and zero mean @xmath30=0 .",

    "thus , for positive @xmath33 , the modified form @xmath34 prevents the particle from getting stuck at the origin ( @xmath35 ) , while for negative @xmath33 the choice @xmath36 avoids the divergence of @xmath6 at the origin . the power - law form ( [ power - diff ] ) along with the regularisations for sub- and superdiffusion are shown in the top panel of fig .",

    "@xmath16 , a vanishing ergodicity breaking parameter is a sufficient condition for the ergodicity of a given stochastic process .",

    "<S> we consider diffusion processes with a spatially varying diffusivity giving rise to anomalous diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> such heterogeneous diffusion processes are analysed for the cases of exponential , power - law , and logarithmic dependencies of the diffusion coefficient on the particle position . combining analytical approaches with stochastic simulations , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the functional form of the space - dependent diffusion coefficient and the initial conditions of the diffusing particles are vital for their statistical and ergodic properties . in all three cases </S>",
    "<S> a weak ergodicity breaking between the time and ensemble averaged mean squared displacements is observed . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate a population splitting of the time averaged traces into fast and slow diffusers for the case of exponential variation of the diffusivity as well as a particle trapping in the case of the logarithmic diffusivity . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is complemented by the quantitative study of the space coverage , the diffusive spreading of the probability density , as well as the survival probability . </S>"
