    "a _ quandle _ ( sometimes called a _ distributive groupoid_)@xcite is a non - associative algebraic structure which is particularly connected to the study of classical knots . in particular",
    "a quandle may be defined as a set @xmath0 together with an left - invertible binary operation which we will write by exponentiation @xmath1 obeying the following relations : @xmath2 @xmath3 note that left invertibility is equivalent to also requiring that the equation @xmath4 with variable @xmath5 should have exactly one solution .",
    "these relations are analogues of the reidemeister moves for classical knots . in particular , eq . [ q1 ] reflects the first reidemeister move , left invertibility reflects the second , and eq .",
    "[ q2 ] reflects the third .",
    "for this reason , they are particularly suited to the study of knots .",
    "joyce@xcite showed in particular that there is a quandle naturally associated to any knot in @xmath6 which is a nearly complete ( up to mirror - reversal ) invariant of the knot .",
    "the quandle associated to a classical knot is a special case of joyce s quandle associated to any codimension two knotting .",
    "we briefly review this construction here , referring the reader to joyce s exposition for further details .",
    "+ let @xmath7 be a path - connected manifold , and let @xmath8 be a codimension two knotting ( neither @xmath7 nor @xmath8 need to be spheres ) .",
    "let @xmath9 be a tubular neighborhood of @xmath8 .",
    "then @xmath10 is a manifold with boundary .",
    "one component of @xmath11 will be @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 be the subgroup of @xmath14 which is the image of the homomorphism induced by the injection @xmath15 .",
    "we refer to this as the _ peripheral _ subgroup .",
    "note that @xmath13 is defined only up to conjugation ; any of its conjugates are also peripheral . +",
    "now suppose that in @xmath13 there is a preferred element @xmath16 , the _",
    "meridian_. in particular for any codimension two knot , the meridian is canonically defined up to conjugation .",
    "we may now define the quandle @xmath0 associated to the pair @xmath17 and the chosen meridian .",
    "the elements of @xmath0 are homotopy classes of paths that start at the basepoint of @xmath7 ( that is , the basepoint chosen for the fundamental group ) and end in @xmath12 , where homotopies are required to preserve these two conditions .",
    "the quandle operation on two elements of @xmath18 is defined geometrically as illustrated in fig .",
    "in particular , @xmath19^{[q']}$ ] is the homotopy class of paths containing the path @xmath20 , where the overbar indicates that the path is followed in reverse .",
    "it is a striaghtforward exercise to show that this is well - defined and meets the definition of a quandle operation .    , while the black circles represent points on @xmath12.[qop ] ]    note that there is an action @xmath14 action on @xmath18 : @xmath19g$ ] is the equivalence class including the homotopy class of the path @xmath21 .",
    "we follow the notation of joyce for this action .",
    "given a group @xmath22 , a subgroup @xmath13 , and an element @xmath16 in the center @xmath23 , joyce defines a quandle as follows .",
    "the underlying set is the set of right cosets of @xmath13 , @xmath24 .",
    "we define the quandle operation such that @xmath25 .",
    "this is well - defined , because if @xmath26 , then @xmath27 for some @xmath28 .",
    "then @xmath29 where the last equality follows from @xmath30 .",
    "we will denote a quandle constructed in this way by @xmath31 , or simply @xmath24 when there is a canonical choice for @xmath16 ( as there is when @xmath16 is a meridian and @xmath13 a peripheral subgroup ) .",
    "the work in this section is largely a generalization of the work of joyce@xcite for the case of classical knots .",
    "+ consider a codimension two pair @xmath32 , and the tubular neighborhood @xmath9 of @xmath8 .",
    "then we can define the quandle @xmath33 geometrically as in the first section . on the other hand we can define the quandle @xmath22 to be the quandle @xmath34 for p some arbitrarily chosen peripheral subgroup of @xmath35 , and @xmath16 the meridian in @xmath13 .",
    "+ now @xmath36 acts on @xmath0 by setting @xmath19g$ ] to be the equivalence class including the homotopy class of the path @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath16 is an element of the fundamental group , but we may also define an analogous element @xmath37 in the fundamental quandle to be the quandle element such that @xmath38 is the meridian of @xmath13 .    every element @xmath39 may be obtained as @xmath40 for some element @xmath41.[transq ]    * proof : * we choose representatives of @xmath42 whose endpoints on @xmath43 agree .",
    "then the path @xmath44 represents the same quandle class as @xmath45 .",
    "however , the path @xmath46 starts and ends at the basepoint , and hence represents some element of the fundamental group .",
    "thus ( abusing the notational difference between paths and their equivalence classes ) @xmath47.@xmath48 + this shows in addition that the group action on @xmath0 is transitive .",
    "@xmath49 iff @xmath50 for some @xmath28 .",
    "* proof : * if @xmath50 then it is straightforward to see that @xmath49 . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath49 , then there is a map of the disk into @xmath7 as shown in fig .",
    "[ tri ] .",
    "to @xmath51 with the endpoint of the path tracing out a path @xmath52 on @xmath43.[tri ] ]    but this disk shows that the path which follows @xmath53 is contractible .",
    "however , @xmath54 is in the peripheral group , and we have our result.@xmath48 + a similar argument shows that the stabilizer of @xmath40 is @xmath55 . for elements in that conjugate peripheral group are easily seen to stabilize @xmath40 . in particular if @xmath56 , then @xmath57 . on the other hand if some some element of the fundamental group stabilizes @xmath40 we may build another homotopy disk as in the previous lemma .",
    "as the stabilizer does not play a role in our following argument we leave the details of the construction as an exercise .",
    "+ let us now turn our attention to the quandle @xmath22 which is built from the fundamental group and the peripheral information .",
    "our goal is to establish the following result :    [ main ] @xmath58 as quandles ; hence the quandle can be recovered from the fundamental group and peripheral information .",
    "we begin by noting that the underlying set of @xmath22 is just the set of right cosets of @xmath59 .",
    "therefore @xmath59 naturally acts on @xmath22 , and this action is obviously transitive .",
    "indeed , every element of @xmath22 is of the form @xmath60 for some @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath62 iff @xmath50 for some @xmath28 .",
    "+ we now define a quandle morphism @xmath63 sending @xmath64 .",
    "this is well defined and invertible by our previous lemmas , so we need only show that it is a quandle map as well .",
    "now @xmath65 this is mapped to @xmath66 which is precisely @xmath67 . that the inverse map is also",
    "a morphism of quandles follows similarly .",
    "therefore this is an invertible quandle morphism , and hence an isomorphism of quandles , establishing thm .",
    "joyce has also proved a theorem for classical knots stating that the triple @xmath68 can be reconstructed from @xmath69 .",
    "this is because @xmath59 is isomorphic to @xmath70 , the free group on @xmath69 quotiented by taking all the relations on @xmath69 and treating the quandle operation as conjugation in the group .",
    "we write an element @xmath39 as @xmath71 when we wish to designate them as elements of @xmath70 .",
    "note that @xmath70 is canonically isomorphic to @xmath59 ( up to a choice of basepoint ) , by sending @xmath71 to the homotopy class of a wirtinger generator , @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "then in @xmath70 one may take @xmath16 to be any of the elements of the generators defined .",
    "@xmath70 acts on @xmath0 by @xmath73 .",
    "if an element of @xmath70 has two presentations , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , this implies that those products of wirtinger generators are homotopic rel basepoints , and this homotopy passes to a homotopy of @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",
    "it is then straightforward to check that this action of @xmath70 is just the geometrically defined action of @xmath59 on @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath13 will be the stabilizer of @xmath78 under this action , and so the triple can be recovered from the quandle .",
    "+ however , this only permits us to recover the triple when all the relations on @xmath79 can be written down in terms of conjugation",
    ". if @xmath79 has no such presentation , then this will not be possible .",
    "checking this condition is complicated , however , by the fact that @xmath0 will generally be infinite , and so the presentation we obtain will not be a finite presentation .",
    "nonetheless , for higher - dimensional knots in spheres , the above argument shows :    for codimension two knots in spheres of any dimension , the quandle and the triple @xmath68 can both be calculated from the other .",
    "more generally this holds for codimension two knots in simply connected spaces.[hid ]    thm .",
    "[ main ] does imply that any invariant based upon quandles for any knot should be interpretable as an invariant based upon classical knot invariants .",
    "thus , for example , the quandle cocycle invariants@xcite are determined by the triple @xmath68 , even for higher - dimensional knots .",
    "this becomes even more powerful when it is recalled that the peripheral group of a sphere is cyclic , and hence is determined by @xmath16 . on the other hand , since in general @xmath80 for some normal subgroup @xmath81 , this indicates that for higher - dimensional knots which as manifolds have large fundamental groups , the quandle has the potential to capture more information than for those with smaller fundamental groups .",
    "+ eisermann@xcite has in fact shown that the quandle cocycle invariants of classical knots is a specialization of certain colourings of their fundamental groups .",
    "his construction makes use of the full peripheral structure of the classical knot ( that is , the longitude and the meridian ) , and hence does not generalize immediately to higher dimensions .",
    "however , in light of our result here , we pose the question of whether a similar construction might not be possible in higher dimensions . + as a last application of our result , we give the following theorem .",
    "recall that _",
    "virtual _ knots are a combinatorial generalization of knot diagrams introduced by kauffman@xcite , and welded knots are a quotient of virtual knots given by adding an additional permitted move , first explored for braids in @xcite . when the diagrams are allowed to have two endpoints instead of being closed we obtain virtual ( welded ) _",
    "_ arcs__@xcite .",
    "* proof : * satoh@xcite has defined a map @xmath83 on welded knots and arcs ( hence on virtual knots and arcs ) which maps each knot or arc to a surface knot , and shown that @xmath83 preserves the quandle and fundamental group .",
    "in addition , a direct calculation shows that @xmath13 and @xmath16 are preserved by @xmath83@xcite .",
    "but the latter determine the quandle for the surface knot , and hence also for the virtual or welded knot or arc .",
    "+ to see that the quandle determines the triple @xmath82 , it suffices to check this for surface knots , as was done in thm .",
