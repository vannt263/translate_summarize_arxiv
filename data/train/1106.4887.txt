    "an extensive research program with polarized antiprotons has been proposed recently by the pax collaboration  @xcite .",
    "this program initiated a discussion of various methods to polarize stored antiprotons .",
    "one of the methods being considered is to use multiple scattering off a polarized target .",
    "if all particles remain in the beam ( scattering angle is smaller than the acceptance angle @xmath2 ) , only spin flip can lead to polarization buildup , as was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , spin - flip cross section is negligibly small  @xcite .",
    "hence the most realistic method is spin filtering  @xcite .",
    "this method implements the dependence of the cross section on orientation of the spins of the particles .",
    "therefore the number of antiprotons scattered out of the beam after the interaction with a polarized target depends on their spins , which results in the polarization buildup .",
    "the interaction with atomic electrons ca nt provide noticeable polarization because in this case antiprotons will scatter only in small angles and all antiprotons remain in the beam  @xcite .",
    "thus it is necessary to study antiproton - nuclear scattering .    at present , theory ca nt give reliable predictions for @xmath3  cross section below  @xmath4{gev}$ ] and different phenomenological models are usually used for numerical estimations . as a result ,",
    "the cross sections obtained are model - dependent .",
    "all models are based on fitting experimental data for scattering of unpolarized particles .",
    "these models give similar predictions for spin - independent part of the cross sections , but predictions for spin - dependent parts may differ drastically .",
    "different nucleon - antinucleon potentials have similar behavior at large distance ( ) because long - range potentials are obtained by applying g - parity transformation to well - known nucleon - nucleon potential .",
    "the most important difference between nucleon - antinucleon and nucleon - nucleon scattering is existence of annihilation channels . a phenomenological description of annihilation is usually based on an optical potential of the form @xmath5 imaginary part of this potential describes annihilation into mesons and is important at small distance .",
    "the process of annihilation has no generally accepted description , and short - range potentials in various models are different .",
    "one of the methods to polarize antiprotons being investigated is to use scattering off a polarized hydrogen target .",
    "spin - dependent parts of the cross section of @xmath6  interaction were previously calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite using the paris potential and in ref .",
    "@xcite with the help of the nijmegen potential .",
    "similar calculations were performed in ref .",
    "@xcite where various forms of julich potentials were explored .",
    "all models listed above predict a possibility to obtain a noticeable beam polarization in a reasonable time , but the value of the polarization degree predicted is essentially different .",
    "another possibility to polarize stored antiprotons being considered is to use polarized deuteron target instead of a hydrogen target .",
    "theoretical investigation of antiproton - deuteron scattering is the subject present paper is devoted to .",
    "we make use of the nijmegen model to calculate @xmath3 scattering amplitudes . in order to calculate @xmath0 cross sections we utilize the glauber theory  @xcite .",
    "we believe that the glauber approach has sufficient precision for the description of @xmath0 scattering in the energy region concerned .",
    "the figures confirming this statement are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] . in the present paper",
    "we show our predictions for the spin - dependent parts of @xmath0 cross sections along with the expected antiproton beam polarization degree . the comparison with the predictions from ref .",

    "our method of calculation is similar to that described in ref .",
    "we make use of the glauber theory to describe scattering by a deuteron . in the present paper",
    "we give the formulas for the standard glauber theory  @xcite which does nt include the d - wave contribution in the deuteron wave function and the spin dependence of @xmath3 scattering amplitudes .",
    "the modification of this theory taking these factors into account for the case of @xmath7 scattering can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . within the standard glauber theory",
    "the amplitudes for elastic and breakup scattering are given by the following matrix elements @xmath8 between initial @xmath9 and final @xmath10 states of the two - nucleon system . here",
    "the transition operator is @xmath11 where @xmath12  is the momentum transfer , @xmath13  is the impact parameter ( the transverse component of @xmath14 ) , @xmath15  are antiproton - nucleon elastic scattering amplitudes and @xmath16  is the antiproton momentum , @xmath17  being the nucleon mass and @xmath18   being the antiproton kinetic energy in the laboratory frame .",
    "note that the antiproton momentum and antiproton - nucleon scattering amplitudes should be calculated in the same reference system .",
