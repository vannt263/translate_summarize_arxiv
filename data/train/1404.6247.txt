    "three characteristics are computed for each institution @xmath0 ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) : the institution size ( @xmath1 ) , representing the total number of distinct authors that published at least one paper at institution @xmath0 ; the number of papers ( @xmath2 ) published under affiliation @xmath0 ; the cumulative number of citations @xmath3 collected by all papers @xmath2 .",
    "we find that @xmath4 follows a fat tailed distribution , indicating significant population heterogeneity among different institutions ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) . while most institutions are small , a few have a large number of scientists , often corresponding to large institutes or universities .",
    "we observe similar disparity in @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) : few institutions acquire a large number of citations , while most research labs or universities receive few citations .",
    "figures [ fig2]c - d show the correlation between the institution size @xmath6 and both the average publications impact @xmath7 and the average productivity @xmath8 of institutions .",
    "the average productivity and impact of an institution are different but complementary measures of scientific performance .",
    "we find the institution size has little influence on productivity ( @xmath9 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]d ) , yet it positively correlates with the impact of publications ( @xmath10 ) , indicating that large institutions offer a more innovative / higher impact environment than smaller ones as captured by citations per paper ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]c ) .",
    "also , as larger institutions have more internal collaborations , the number of co - authors in publications from large institutions might be larger and , as a consequence , attracts more citations @xcite .",
    "many institutions are small with few citations , hence they account for very small portion of the data . for the rest of the paper , we will focus on the thousand most cited institutions , accounting for more than @xmath11 of papers .",
    "they correspond to institutions with at least 698 citations within the aps data over the 120-year period ( shaded area in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "mobility is often important in furthering a professional career @xcite . in science ,",
    "the best lab for the type of research you are doing is usually not where you are @xcite .",
    "nowadays changing countries is a rite of passage for many young researchers who follow the resources and facilities @xcite .",
    "as the patterns and characteristics of these migrations are blurry , we need to systematically study the mobility of scientists .",
    "thanks to the large disambiguated data spanning the last 120 years that we have compiled , a systematic study of scientific mobility is now possible .    the strong correlations between the three quantities ( @xmath12 ) indicate any of the three could characterise an institution , serving as a proxy of its ranking against others . here , we choose @xmath13 ( the total number of citations ) as our parameter to approximate the ranking by reputation .",
    "other parameters such as the h - index of an institution or the number of papers @xmath14 could also be used @xcite .",
    "but the results should be insensitive to this choice owing to good correlations between these quantities ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively ) .",
    "the top - ranked institutions all correspond to well - known universities or research labs with long tradition of excellence in physics ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , corroborating our hypothesis that @xmath13 is a reasonable proxy for ranking .",
    "we can also observe the similarity and stability of other rankings when comparing with other metrics .",
    "is a reasonable proxy for ranking , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we focus on authors with similar career longevity , restricting our corpus to those who began their career between 1950 and 1980 and published for at least 20 years without any interruption exceeding 5 years . following these criteria , we arrived at a subset of 2,725 scientists to study the mobility patterns and their impact on their careers .",
    "a total of 5,915 career movements are recorded for this corpus .    in figure",
    "[ fig4]a we select three individuals as exemplary career histories .",
    "each line represents one individual , with circles denoting his / her publications , allowing us to observe his / her location .",
    "the size of the circle is proportional to citations the paper acquires in five years , approximating the impact of the work . by studying the whole corpus",
    ", we compute @xmath17 , the probability for a scientist to have visited @xmath18 different institutions along his career ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]c ) , finding that career movements are common but infrequent : only @xmath19 of them never moved at all ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "for the ones that move , they mostly move once or twice , @xmath17 decaying quickly as @xmath18 increases .",
    "we also compute @xmath21 , the probability to observe a movement at time @xmath22 , where @xmath23 corresponds to the date of the scientist s first publication .",
    "we find that most movements occurred in the early stage of the career ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]b ) , supporting the hypothesis that changing affiliations is a rite of passage for young researchers @xcite .",
    "this likely corresponds to the postdoc period where graduates broaden their horizons through mobility .",
    "this may also reflect the increasing cost of relocation and family constraints as family developed @xcite .",
    "a third characteristic is the geographical distance of movements , @xmath24 .",
    "existing literature hints for somewhat competing hypothesis in the role geography plays in career movements .",
    "indeed , research on human mobility suggests that regular human movements mostly cover short distances with occasional longer trips , characterized by a power law distance distribution @xcite ; in contrast , country - level surveys find increasing cross - country movements mostly due to cultural exposure and life quality concerns , indicating potential dominance in long distance moves in career choices comparing with typical human travels @xcite .",
    "we measure the distance distribution over all moves observed in our dataset , finding that our result is supported by a combination of both hypothesis .",
    "we find the probability to move to further locations decays as a power law @xcite , whereas the null model predicts this probability to be flat ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]d ) .",
    "this observation is consistent with studies on human mobility , that short distance moves dominate career choices .",
    "yet , when comparing the power law exponents , we find the exponent characterizing career moves ( @xmath25 ) is much smaller than those observed in human travel ( @xmath26 ) , corresponding to higher likelihood of observing long range movements .",
    "this observation might be explained by the influence that scientific collaborations can have on career movements as similar low exponents are observed for collaboration network between cities @xcite .        taken together",
    ", the preceding results indicate that career moves mostly happen during the early stage of a career and are more likely to cover short distances .",
    "the observed location in both time and space raises the question of how individual moves as a function of institutional rankings . to this end , denoting with @xmath27 the number of transitions from the institution of rank @xmath0 to the one of rank @xmath28 , we measure @xmath29 , the probability to have a transition from rank @xmath0 to rank @xmath28 as @xmath30 interestingly , we find that most movements involve elite institutions ( rank is small ) , and transitions between bottom institutions are rare ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]a ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that elite institutions are characterised by larger populations , hence translating into more events .    to account for the population based heterogeneity , we compare the observed @xmath29 with the probability @xmath31 expected in a random model where we randomly shuffle the transitions from institution @xmath0 to @xmath28 while preserving the total number of transitions from and to each institution . formally , in this null model , we have @xmath32 and we compare @xmath29 with the null model by computing the matrix @xmath33 @xmath34 is the ratio between the probability @xmath29 to have a transition from rank @xmath0 to @xmath28 divided by the probability @xmath31 when the movements are shuffled , measuring the likelihood for a move to take place by accounting for the size of the institutions .",
    "hence , @xmath35 indicates the amount of observed movements is about what one would expect if movements were random .",
    "similarly , @xmath36 indicates that we observe more transitions from @xmath0 to @xmath28 than we expected , whereas @xmath37 corresponds to transitions that are underrepresented .",
    "we find that career moves are characterized by a high degree of stratification in institutional rankings ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]b ) .",
    "indeed , we observe two distinct clubs ( red spots in fig .  [ fig5]b ) , indicating that the overrepresented movements are the ones within elite institutions ( lower - left corner ) or within lower - rank institutions ( upper - right corner ) , and scientists belonging to one of the two groups tend to move to institutions within the same group . on the other hand , both upper - left and lower - right corners are colored blue , indicating cross group movements ( transitions from elite to lower - rank institutions and vice - versa ) are significantly underrepresented .",
    "also , scientists from medium - ranked institutions move to the next institution with a probability that is indistinguishable from the random case . in other words ,",
    "their movements indicate no bias towards middle , elite or lower - ranked institutions .",
    "the high intensity of stratification in career movements raises an interesting question : how does individual performance in science relate to their moves across different institutional rankings ?    to answer this question , we need to quantify the performance change for each individual before and after the move .",
    "imagine that a scientist moves from @xmath0 to @xmath28 , and published @xmath38 papers at location @xmath0 and @xmath18 papers at @xmath28 .",
    "the impact of a paper @xmath39 can be approximated by @xmath40 , the number of citations cumulated within 5 years after its publication @xcite .",
    "let @xmath41 and @xmath42 be the lists of number of citations for papers published before ( @xmath43 ) and after ( @xmath44 ) the transition from @xmath0 to @xmath28 ( @xmath27 ) . to quantify the change in performance , we introduce @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the average of @xmath44 and @xmath43 , respectively , and @xmath48 corresponds to the standard deviation of the concatenation of both @xmath44 and @xmath43 while preserving the moment when the movement took place ( see sm for more information about @xmath48 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath49 captures the statistical difference in the average citations between papers published before and after the movement normalized by the random expectation when the same author s publications were shuffled .",
    "a positive @xmath49 indicates papers following the move on average result in higher citation impact , hence representing an improvement in scientific performance .",
    "a negative value corresponds to a decline in performance .    to quantify the influence of movements on individual performance , we divide all movements into two categories based on the performance change : movements associated with positive and negative @xmath49 , and measure @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we find the observed stratification in career moves is robust against individual performance ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]c - d ) .",
    "that is , the two clubs emerge for both categories in a similar fashion as in figure [ fig5]b , indicating the pattern of moving within elite or lower - rank institutions is nearly universal for people whose performance is improved or decreased following the move .",
    "comparing figure [ fig5]c and figure [ fig5]d , we find the red spot in lower - left corner is more concentrated in figure [ fig5]d than in figure [ fig5]c , hinting that being more mobile in the space of rankings may lead to variable performance . to test this hypothesis ,",
    "for each transition @xmath27 we calculate the rank difference between the origin and destination ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "a positive value of @xmath53 indicates @xmath54 , hence a movement to a lower - rank institution , whereas @xmath55 corresponds to transitions into institutions with a higher rank . in figure [ fig6 ]",
    "we measure the relation between @xmath49 and @xmath56 .",
    "when scientists move to institutions with a lower rank ( @xmath57 ) , we find that their average change in performance is negative , corresponding to a decline in the impact of their work .",
    "yet , what is particularly interesting lies in the @xmath58 regime . indeed ,",
    "when people move from lower rank location to elite institutions , we observe no performance change on average .",
    "this is rather unexpected , as transitioning from lower - rank institutions to elite institutions is thought to provide better access to ideas and lab resources , which in turn should fuel scientific productivity .",
    "a possible explanation may be that scientist who have the opportunity to make big jumps in the ranking space may have already had an excellent performance in their previous institutions . a move",
    "therefore will not affect their impact .    ) and the ranking difference ( @xmath56 ) associated to a transition shows that , when people move to institutions with a lower rank ( @xmath57 ) , their average change in performance is negative , corresponding to a decline in the impact of their work .",
    "yet , what is particularly interesting lies in the @xmath58 regime .",
    "indeed , when people move from lower rank location to elite institutions , we observe no performance change on average . ]",
    "in summary , we extracted affiliation information from the publications of each scientist , allowing us to reconstruct their career moves between different institutions as well as the body of work published at each location .",
    "we find career movements are common yet infrequent .",
    "most people move only once or twice , and usually in the early stage of their career .",
    "career movements are affected by geography . the distance covered by the move",
    "can be approximated with a power law distribution , indicating that most movements are local and moving to faraway locations is less probable .",
    "we also observe a high degree of stratification in career movements .",
    "people from elite institutions are more likely to move to other elite institutions , whereas people from lower rank institutions are more likely to move to places with similar ranks .",
    "we further confirm that the observed stratification is robust against the change in individual performance before and after the move .",
    "when cross - group movement occurs , we find that while going from elite to lower - rank institutions on average results in a modest decrease in scientific impact , transitioning into elite institutions , does not result in gain in impact .",
    "the nature of our dataset restricted our study on a sample of scientists . as a result of this selection process",
    ", our results are biased towards physicists from 1960s to 1980s with high career longevity . yet",
    ", these limitations also suggest new avenues for further investigations .",
    "indeed , as datasets become more comprehensive and of higher resolution , newly available data sources like web of science or google scholar can provide new and deeper insights towards generalization of the results across different disciplines , temporal trends , and more .",
    "further investigations regarding the influence of career longevity on scientific mobility should also be considered as it could reveal as well results of importance .",
