    "communication systems increasingly use wideband speech in applications such as videoconferencing and teleconferencing .",
    "however , the pstn and wireless networks mostly use the @xmath0 telephone band .",
    "part of this limitation is due to the @xmath6 sampling rate used in those systems .",
    "one way to increase the audio bandwidth is to increase the sampling frequency to @xmath7 .",
    "however , this is not practical in many situations either because of bandwidth limitations ( for example in wireless systems ) or because it would require huge modifications to legacy systems ( as in the pstn ) .",
    "another approach is to use the spectral redundancies of speech to recover the wideband components from the received narrowband speech .",
    "we propose , in this paper , a system to recover wideband speech from narrowband speech using a small amount of side information .",
    "unlike other approaches @xcite , which attempt to recover the @xmath8 band from the @xmath9 band , the proposed system recovers both the low - frequency ( @xmath4 ) and the high - frequency ( @xmath5 ) bands using only the @xmath0 telephone band and additional side information .",
    "the objective is to minimize the bit - rate of this side information towards an ultimate goal of @xmath10 .",
    "the system uses a speech - specific model , hence it does not work well for general audio .",
    "the complete system block diagram is shown in figure [ system ] .",
    "the inverse irm filter is an fir filter which , once convolved with the irm filter , gives a flat response in the @xmath11 range .",
    "since not all voice systems use irm filtered speech , this inverse filter is optional . for the remaining of the paper",
    ", the term `` narrowband '' signal will refer to the output of the inverse irm filter .",
    "note that the low - frequency and high - frequency bands are regenerated using different approaches .",
    "it is also worth noting that the up - sampling block includes the necessary anti - aliasing filter .",
    "for the low frequencies ( @xmath4 ) , we make the assumption that in this band , voiced speech can be represented as a set of , at most , two sinusoids ( i.e. the first two harmonics ) . a controlled sinusoidal oscillator is used to generate the pitch harmonics .",
    "the frequency of the oscillator is given by the pitch analysis and the phase is adjusted so that it remains coherent across frames .",
    "we make the assumption that the absolute phase is not too perceptually relevent .",
    "once the two harmonics are generated in the lower band , they must be scaled to the right amplitude ( figure [ fig_lf ] ) .",
    "the scaling factor is estimated using a multi - layer perceptron network .",
    "the network we use has 18 inputs :    * 16 mel frequency cepstral coefficients calculated on the narrowband signal , and * the pitch gain and delay .",
    "the two outputs of the network are the gains ( in the log domain ) for each of the two synthesized harmonics .",
    "we use 2 hidden layers with 10 units per layer .",
    "the two hidden layers use a hyperbolic tangent as the activation function , while the output layer uses linear activation functions , so that the outputs are not restricted to @xmath12 $ ] interval .      in order to evaluate the harmonics amplitude for training the neural network ,",
    "the first two harmonics are extracted using a least - square fit of windowed sinusoids .",
    "the amplitude of the two sinusoids is calculated as    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the windowed , rectified narrowband signal and @xmath15 is a 128 by 5 matrix where each column is one of the basis functions for the current frame . the first basis function is a hanning window ( windowed dc ) , while the others are windowed sines and cosines at the first and second harmonic .",
    "for instance , the second basis function is @xmath16 \\sin \\left ( \\frac{2\\pi n}{t}\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the length of the window and @xmath18 is the pitch period .",
    "the accuracy of the process depends on pitch evaluation .",
    "some of the problems encountered are due to pitch period doubling .",
    "the problem seems to be worse for females than males .",
    "for high frequency reconstruction , we use an lpc analysis to divide the signal into a spectrally - flat excitation and a synthesis filter representing the spectral envelope .",
    "the excitation and the envelope are extended independently in the @xmath5 band , as shown in figure [ fig_hf ] .",
    "it is important to note that the input of the process is pre - filtered to emphasize high frequencies .",
    "this improves the lpc analysis accuracy .      because of the phase considerations in extending the excitation , it is much easier to work in the time domain .",
    "there are two widely used methods to perform excitation extension in the time domain @xcite :    * over - sampling excitation , which causes spectrum folding by aliasing , and * using a non - linear function to generate harmonics at higher frequencies .",
    "because of the `` artificial tones '' caused by the folding method , we prefer the non - linearity approach .",
    "the absolute value function is a good candidate for this method since , unlike the square value , it does not require energy normalization .",
    "the wideband excitation generated in this fashion is phase - coherent with the original narrowband excitation and preserves the harmonic structure without any discontinuity in the spectrum . unlike the spectral folding technique which produces very tonal harmonics at higher frequencies , the absolute value function increases the noise level between the high - frequency harmonics ( sounding more natural ) .",
    "the whitening filter is used to flatten the spectrum of the extended excitation so that it is similar to the excitation that would have been calculated from wideband speech .",
    "this is done by performing an lpc analysis and using the resulting coefficients to whiten the extended excitation .",
    "a gain must then be applied so that the low - frequency energy is equal to the low - frequency energy of the narrowband excitation .",
    "several approaches were considered to extrapolate the high - frequency spectral envelope from the narrowband spectral envelope . in all cases ,",
    "the subjective quality was not satisfactory .",
    "this suggests that the high - frequency formant structure of speech can not be accurately predicted from the narrowband formants .",
    "hence , side information is used to transmit the high - frequency spectral envelope as shown in figure [ fig_hf ] .",
    "this spectral information is transmitted in the transform domain .",
    "specifically , the power spectrum of an lpc filter is first calculated on the original wideband speech .",
    "after proper energy scaling , the @xmath5 band of this power spectrum is vector quantized in the log - domain using 40 frequency - points ( 64 points for the whole @xmath19 spectrum ) .",
    "the receiver concatenates this high - frequency spectral information with its local calculation of the narrowband spectral envelope ( figure [ fig_hf ] ) .",
    "the full - band lpc filter ( @xmath20 in figure [ fig_hf ] ) can then be recovered by an inverse transform followed by levinson - durbin recursion .",
    "it was found that an 8-bit vector quantizer was sufficient to transmit a good estimate of the high band .",
    "we use a vq trained with a variant of the lbg algorithm . with a frame size of 256 samples at a sampling rate of @xmath7 ,",
    "the bit rate necessary to transmit this side information is minimal  @xmath3 .",
    "the objective of this work is to reduce this side information rate as close to zero as possible .",
    "because the phase of the original wideband signal is not preserved at both low and high frequencies , measuring the system performance using objective measures , such as the snr , is not possible .",
    "however , it has been noted that for the high - frequency band , the effect of replacing the original wideband excitation by the reconstructed excitation is very small . this leaves the envelope reconstruction as the main cause of distortion . using a codebook of 256 vectors for the high - frequency envelope",
    ", we obtain a mean spectral distortion of @xmath21 over the @xmath22 range .",
    "this spectral distortion could be further reduced by coding the difference between the real envelope and a prediction .",
    "note that the training set and test set are disjoint .",
    "each contains 40 minutes of speech after removing all silence .",
    "the result of the highband recovery is perceptually very close to the original wideband speech .",
    "however , unlike the high - frequency problem , the error in the estimation of the low - frequency harmonics is perceptible .",
    "some artifacts are caused by the fact that the amplitude of the added sinusoids are not coded .",
    "the mean error in estimating the low - frequency harmonics amplitudes with a multi - layer perceptron network is @xmath23 .    when starting from _ coded _ narrowband speech using either g. 729 ( at @xmath24 ) or efr gsm ( at @xmath25 ) , we obtain a quality comparable to the case when the narrowband speech is not coded .    figures [ fig_voi ] and [ fig_unv ] show the reconstructed wideband ( with a @xmath26 offset ) compared to the original wideband for both voiced and unvoiced speech .",
    "the spectra were calculated using a @xmath27 hanning window .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a method to recover wideband speech using narrowband speech and minimal side information .",
    "the resulting wideband speech has enhanced quality compared to narrowband speech .",
    "although the high - frequency band can be almost perfectly reconstructed , the low - frequency band still contains some noticeable artifacts .",
