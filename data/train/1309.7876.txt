    "<S> we experimentally demonstrate first - order ( fold ) and second - order ( cusp ) catastrophes in the density of an atomic cloud reflected from an optical barrier in the presence of gravity , and show their corresponding universal asymptotic behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the cusp point enables robust , field - free refocusing of an expanding atomic cloud with a wide velocity distribution . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the density attained at the cusp point in our experiment reached 65% of the peak density of the atoms in the trap prior to their release . </S>",
    "<S> we thereby add caustics to the various phenomena with parallels in optics that can be harnessed for manipulation of cold atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the structural stability of catastrophes provides inherent robustness against variations in the system s dynamics and initial conditions , making them suitable for manipulation of atoms under imperfect conditions and limited controllability . </S>",
    "<S> +    from the formation of galaxy clusters in the early universe to the optical caustics at the bottom of a pool , catastrophes play an important role in nature  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sudden changes in the behavior of every system around a catastrophe obey the same universal laws described by singularity theory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> catastrophes appear in nature in the common situation in which the observed behavior of a system reflects some nontrivial mapping of the parameters that govern it . </S>",
    "<S> thus , even if the phase - space distribution of the system is smooth , drastic shifts in its apparent behavior arise in places where the gradient of this mapping is zero . </S>",
    "<S> intuitively , such a mapping resembles ironing a wrinkled shirt , in which the fabric is forced onto a flat plane , leaving fold marks where the surface of the shirt was steeply curved . </S>",
    "<S> unsurprisingly , the lowest - order catastrophe is indeed called a fold catastrophe , occurring when the gradient of the mapping as a function of a single control parameter vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> when another control parameter is added , a higher - order catastrophe can arise , creating a ` cusp ' at the point where two fold lines meet  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> catastrophes are structurally stable exactly in the same sense that slight variations in the positioning of the shirt on the ironing board may cause the fold lines to move , but not to vanish  @xcite . in contrast , the focusing of rays by a lens is an unstable singularity , which ` dissolves ' as a result of any perturbation in the lens shape or any deviation from the correct imaging conditions . in optics , </S>",
    "<S> catastrophes are more widely known as caustics  @xcite , and their structural stability is reflected by their abundance : one does not have to carefully tune the position of his cup to observe a bright cusp feature at its bottom , and curved lines of light nearly always appear at the bottom of a swimming pool . </S>",
    "<S> this robustness makes catastrophes potentially useful for the manipulation of systems with limited controllability or under imperfect conditions , with examples ranging from particle manipulation with airy beams  @xcite to focusing of electron flow   @xcite and high - harmonic generation  @xcite .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we harness catastrophes in the field of atom optics  @xcite , adding caustics to the variety of optical concepts that have already been implemented in this field by using light forces and magnetic potentials to form atomic mirrors , waveguides and lenses  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we demonstrate fold and cusp density catastrophes , utilizing the latter to achieve longitudinal focusing of a freely expanding atomic cloud with a large longitudinal velocity spread . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , similar density singularities were previously studied in a completely different physical context : the large - scale structure of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of an initially smooth universe under its own gravitational potential generates density singularities , known as zeldovich pancakes  @xcite , which played a role in the generation of galaxy clusters  @xcite . in atomic systems , caustics have been theoretically studied in a variety of configurations  @xcite , and experimentally observed with cold atoms trapped in a magnetic waveguide  @xcite and with bose - einstein condensates in an optical lattice  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the case we study is the cold - atoms equivalent of a handful of marbles that are dropped to bounce on the floor . in our setup </S>",
    "<S> , the handful of marbles is actually a trapped cloud of @xmath0 ultracold @xmath1rb atoms at a temperature of @xmath2 , and the ` floor ' is a blue - detuned , @xmath3 thin light sheet that generates a repelling potential barrier a few millimeters below the cloud ( fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : experiment ] ) .     </S>",
    "<S> sketch of the experimental setup , showing a cloud of @xmath0 @xmath1rb atoms at @xmath2 and the optical fields that were used to tailor its initial density distribution immediately after turning off the trap ( see supplemental material ) . </S>",
    "<S> the atoms drop due to gravity and bounce off a ` floor ' created by a blue - detuned beam that generates a repelling potential . ]    at such a low temperature , once released from the trapping potential , the motion of the atoms is dominated by gravity and not by their initial velocities , and the cloud drops like a ball . </S>",
    "<S> if the size of the cloud is small compared to the drop height , it indeed seems to bounce off the barrier like a rigid ball ( see supplemental material ) , similarly to what has been observed with evanescent - wave  @xcite , magnetic  @xcite and optical dipole  @xcite atomic mirrors . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the atoms in our case are non - interacting , the rigid ball description is misleading . </S>",
    "<S> the accurate description of the dynamics along the vertical @xmath4 direction , which is the axis of interest , is therefore the propagation of an ensemble of particles that begin with some phase - space distribution of initial heights and velocities @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> as each atom propagates independently , this initial phase - space distribution evolves according to hamilton s equations . </S>",
    "<S> this can be considered as a time - dependent mapping between initial lagrangian coordinates @xmath5 to eulerian coordinates @xmath6 which describe the resulting height and position as a function of time . as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : draw]a , if the initial distribution can be assumed to lie along some one - dimensional starting curve @xmath7 , then the evolution of this curve defines a two - dimensional smooth manifold @xmath8 , called the lagrangian manifold , embedded in the three - dimensional space @xmath9 .     </S>",
    "<S> simplified illustration of two lagrangian manifolds @xmath8 spanned in the same system by the phase space flow of atoms starting with different sets of initial conditions ( @xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the critical set @xmath11 ( red ) is a smooth curve on @xmath8 , defining the singularity points in the projection of @xmath8 on the @xmath12 measurement plane . in the projection of @xmath11 on the measurement plane </S>",

    "<S> @xmath8 may define a few single - valued velocity functions @xmath17 , the projections of the corresponding linear densities @xmath18 need to be summed : @xmath19 the set of points at which the gradient @xmath20 diverges is called the critical set of the mapping . </S>",
    "<S> this is the set of points at which @xmath8 is perpendicular to the measurement plane , leading to singularities in @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> as was shown by whitney  @xcite , this critical set forms a smooth curve @xmath11 on the manifold @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting types of singularities can be defined by the derivatives of the projection of @xmath11 on the measurement plane ( the blue curves in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : draw ] ) as a function of the position along the curve itself . when this derivative is nonzero the singularity </S>",
    "<S> is called a fold . </S>",

    "<S> , we chose to span the manifold in which @xmath10 is close to a vertical line , i.e. a very small spread in @xmath21 , and a large spread in @xmath22 . to realize this manifold , we let a cold ( @xmath2 ) but large atomic cloud ( standard deviation of @xmath23 in @xmath22 ) drop from a height of @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the height distribution of the atoms as a function of time , extracted from a sequence of fluorescence images ( see supplemental material ) , differs drastically from the behavior of a rigid ball ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> calculated trajectories of atoms released from a hot ( @xmath25 ) pancake - shaped atomic cloud ( standard deviation of @xmath26 , compared to release height of @xmath27 ) , demonstrating refocusing of the cloud after @xmath28 , followed by splitting into two high - density peaks , one moving upwards and the other downwards . </S>",

    "<S> similar behavior was previously observed in an experiment for atom accumulation using an optical `` trap door ''  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying dynamics behind these waves are illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : results]a , which presents the trajectories of individual atoms assuming the same initial height distribution and velocity spread as in the experiment . specifically , atoms that begin at zero velocity one slightly above the other switch places at the instant of the bounce , since the lower atom arrives to the barrier first . </S>",
    "<S> however , conservation of energy implies that the higher atom must eventually cross the lower one to end back on top . </S>",
    "<S> this intersection of the trajectories of atoms from slightly different @xmath22 as they approach their peak height gives rise to density singularities . </S>",
    "<S> since this coalescence happens later for atoms that began higher , these density peaks seem to rise constantly with time , even though each of the individual atoms within the peaks follows the regular parabolic rise and fall . </S>",
    "<S> the critical set for this manifold was derived by neglecting the initial velocity spread of the atoms and rewriting eq .   as a function of the initial linear density distribution @xmath31 along @xmath10 : @xmath32 with @xmath33 being the set of initial positions that are mapped at time @xmath14 to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of this expression leads to a set of rising parabolic fold lines ( dashed lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : results]e ) , one for every bounce number @xmath34 : @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath36 the density peaks are composed of atoms whose trajectory is tangent to this parabola , which occurs when the atoms reach @xmath37 of their initial height . also evident from fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : results]a is the fact that the density peak lines separate between regions in which there are two valid atom trajectories ( for a given @xmath34 ) and regions where there are none , which is indeed a property of fold lines . </S>",
    "<S> another property of catastrophes of this type , derived by arnold , shandarin and zeldovich in their study on the large scale structure of the universe  @xcite , is asymptotic divergence of the form @xmath38 , with @xmath39 for a fold , and @xmath40 for a cusp . </S>",
    "<S> taking into consideration the measured initial parameters of the atomic cloud and the spatial resolution , the density distribution measured at the vicinity of the density peaks yields excellent fit to this behavior ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fits]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> + @xmath36 @xmath36     for fold type singularities , the measured density distribution at a given time ( dots ) is in excellent agreement with the theoretical distribution ( solid line ) using a divergence rate of @xmath39 . in comparison , </S>",
    "<S> divergence rates of @xmath41 ( green dashed line ) and of @xmath40 ( red dashed line ) are inconsistent with the measured results . for a cusp type singularity </S>",
    "<S> , the measured density distribution ( dots ) agrees with the theoretical distribution ( solid line ) using @xmath40 , and is inconsistent with divergence rates of @xmath39 ( green dashed line ) and of @xmath42 ( red dashed line).,scaledwidth=50.5% ]    viewing the dynamics of the atomic cloud as topological mapping provides the means for identifying the conditions in which it will exhibit catastrophic behavior of higher orders as well . in particular , locating a second - order cusp point bears practical significance since , being a turning point of a fold - line , a cusp is closer to ideal focusing , as it can create the situation in which most of the population of the atomic cloud is concentrated at the vicinity of a single point . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as described earlier , a cusp point is in fact as close as one can get to ideal focusing while remaining structurally stable ( in 2d ) . </S>",
    "<S> generally , the search for singularities becomes more complex at higher orders , yet the knowledge of the position of the first - order fold lines can direct us in this search . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , from the solution to hamilton s equations ( see supplemental material ) it can be shown that the projection of the critical set of the previous manifold on the @xmath13 plane forms straight lines , implying that @xmath11 is never perpendicular to the measurement plane . </S>",
    "<S> this rules out the emergence of higher - order catastrophes with this set of initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> thus , to demonstrate a cusp catastrophe we chose the opposite set of initial conditions : a small spread in @xmath22 , and a large spread in @xmath21 , corresponding to a manifold that is initially perpendicular to the previous one ( @xmath10 being a horizontal line ) . to create such initial conditions , </S>",
    "<S> we heated the cloud to @xmath25 using counter - propagating heating beams along the @xmath4-direction ( see fig .  [ experiment ] ) , and then reduced its vertical spread to @xmath43 mm ( see supplemental material ) .    as presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : results]f , the atoms initially expand ballistically and the density drops drastically . </S>",
    "<S> however , after @xmath44 the cloud refocuses , forming a high - density peak which then splits to form two density peaks , one moving upwards and one downwards . </S>",
    "<S> the trajectories plotted in fig .  [ fig : results]b reveal the underlying mechanism of this effect , which is indeed a cusp singularity that evolves into two fold lines . </S>",
    "<S> the analytic expression for the critical set @xmath11 this time was derived by assuming negligible initial spatial spread and solving : @xmath45 the resulting dynamics indeed show divergence of the density in the form of a cusp point that occurs after each bounce , as the atoms that began at rest reach back their original ( and maximal ) height , which then evolves into two fold lines  @xcite ( dashed lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : results]f ) . </S>",
    "<S> the top fold line is composed of atoms that began with positive initial velocity , and the other is composed of atoms that began with negative velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the turning point between positive and negative initial velocities generates the observed focusing at the cusp point . </S>",
    "<S> the divergence rate obtained from the measured density distribution is in excellent agreement with the theoretical value of @xmath46 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fits]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the measured density at the cusp point reached @xmath47 of the initial density of the cloud , immediately after its release from the trap . </S>",
    "<S> note that such focusing in the longitudinal direction can not be achieved with lens - like potentials , as such can not distinguish between fast and slow atoms that travel along the same path . </S>",
    "<S> in essence , this spatial focusing of atoms with a wide velocity distribution can be viewed as complementary to the method of @xmath48-kick cooling , which results in atoms that are cold , yet spread spatially  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + @xmath36 @xmath36 analyzing the density evolution of cold atoms in terms of catastrophe theory does not only place this system in its appropriate , universal context ; it also accurately reveals the rules that govern its dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the singularities demonstrated here are practically insensitive to the parameters of the reflecting potential in the same way that slight stretching or twisting of a folded sheet does not eliminate the fold . </S>",
    "<S> the robustness to the initial conditions stems from the fact that the critical set is completely defined by the shape of @xmath10 , regardless of the exact density distribution along this curve . in other words , the dashed lines in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : results]e and [ fig : results]f , are already there once the manifold is defined , and the specific initial density distribution only ` populates ' these lines . for example </S>",
    "<S> , had we started the cusp experiment with only positive velocities , we would have observed only the upward - going fold evolving from the cusp point , yet the location of this fold and the cusp point would have remained unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the density singularities we demonstrated evolve out of free propagation , and so enable focusing away from any trapping ( and perturbing ) fields . </S>",
    "<S> integrating caustics into the toolbox of atom optics therefore provides an alternative , versatile mechanism , particularly relevant when the analogy of the atomic ensemble to optical beams fails .    </S>",
