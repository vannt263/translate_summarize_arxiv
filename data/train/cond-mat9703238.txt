    "the mechanism of high - temperature superconductivity in hole - doped cuo@xmath2 materials remains a subject of vivid debate @xcite .",
    "the coulomb repulsion between the electrons is poorly screened , at least for low doping levels , and it may be responsible for the pairing @xcite .",
    "this is supported by experimental evidence that the symmetry of the paired state is @xmath12 with lobes in the direction of the cuo - bond .",
    "nevertheless , the results of hubbard- and _ t - j_-model calculations using realistic parameters lead to a suspicion that something more than the coulomb repulsion is needed @xcite . a large amount of experimental data such as superconductivity - induced phonon renormalizations @xcite , a large isotope effect away from optimal doping @xcite , and phonon - related features in the tunnelling spectra @xcite show effects of the electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) .",
    "it is therefore of interest to investigate whether the epi , which gives a pair - interaction , @xmath13 which is always negative ( attractive ) , could support @xmath12-wave pairing with a gap - anisotropy like @xmath14 . for this to occur",
    ", @xmath15 must be large when @xmath16 and @xmath17 have the same sign , and small when they have opposite signs .",
    "such an investigation is the main topic of the present paper .",
    "we first report _ ab initio _ local density - functional ( lda ) calculations of the crystal , electronic , and phononic structure , and of the @xmath0- and @xmath1-channel epis for the infinite - layer compound cacuo@xmath2 .",
    "unfortunately , no single - crystal measurements exist for an infinite - layer htsc , and the ceramic samples for which a @xmath18 of 110k was reported @xcite may be phase impure @xcite .",
    "however , the infinite - layer structure is uniquely simple for theoretical studies and high - temperature superconductivity is generally believed to take place in cuo@xmath2 planes .",
    "as we shall see , also the lda electronic structure of this material , properly relaxed , is very similar to that of the stoichiometrically doped , well - characterized htsc , yba@xmath2cu@xmath6o@xmath11 .",
    "our calculations are for 24 per cent hole - doped cacuo@xmath2 with the hole charge being neutralized by a homogeneous , negative background charge .",
    "we have chosen a doping of 0.24 holes per cuo@xmath2 because this places the fermi level at the uppermost saddle - point in the lda band structure , and because it agrees with the experimental ( average ) doping level .    in the second part of the paper we present analytical low - energy bands , originally derived from lda calculations for yba@xmath2cu@xmath6o@xmath11 @xcite , and derive the epi for the buckling - mode .",
    "this tight - binding model has previously @xcite been used to explain the in - plane dispersion of the inter - plane hopping integral @xmath19 , which is a crucial ingredient of the inter - plane tunnelling model of htsc @xcite.when augmented with a mean - field treatment of the coulomb repulsion @xmath20 between two holes in the same cu @xmath21 orbital , the model has correctly predicted the value of the inter - plane exchange coupling @xmath22 @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we consider the epi in optimally and overdoped htscs and shall assume that @xmath20 is screened completely .",
    "we shall derive an analytical expression for the coupling @xmath23 of the electrons to the buckling mode for a single plane and show that , for this mode , @xmath24 for @xmath21-wave pairing is positive definite .",
    "the analytical tight - binding model should also be useful for further studies .",
    "in this section we discuss the electronic energy bands and the equilibrium structure calculated with our full - potential linear - muffin - tin - orbital ( lmto ) method .",
    "the bands presented in fig . 1 agree in detail with those of previous calculations @xcite , and they hardly change upon hole doping by 10 per cent , except for a downwards shift of the fermi energy to the uppermost van hove singularity ( at r ) as shown in the figure . the fermi surface ( fs )  for the doped compound",

    "a_typical features just below @xmath33 first of all , the uppermost band at x is an antibonding out - of - plane @xmath34 band [ the o@xmath35-cu@xmath36 band at @xmath37 and the o@xmath35-cu@xmath38 band at @xmath39,$ ] whereas at r [ @xmath40 and @xmath41 $ ] the uppermost band is the usual @xmath42-band .",
    "this is due to a relatively strong dispersion , @xmath43 of the @xmath34 band in the @xmath44-direction , a dispersion which is opposite to that , @xmath45 of the @xmath28 band .",
    "secondly , near a the top of the antibonding in - plane @xmath34 band @xmath46nearly reaches @xmath47    our total - energy calculations however predict that this infinite - layer structure is unstable with respect to the @xmath48=0 oxygen out - of - phase buckling mode ( b@xmath49 ) .",
    "we have performed frozen - phonon calculations for both undoped and doped compounds and with both experimental and theoretical lattice parameters .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "we see that a double - well potential exists for such buckling motions , when the system is doped .",
    "the minimum is at 5@xmath50 if we use the experimental values : @xmath51=7.297 a.u . and @xmath52=0.829 , and at 7@xmath50 if we use our theoretically determined values : @xmath51=7.112 a.u . and @xmath52=0.895 .",
    "note that yba@xmath2cu@xmath6o@xmath53 has a 7@xmath50 static in - phase dimpling of the cu - o planes , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the buckling reduces the in - plane @xmath54=@xmath55 and @xmath56=@xmath57 hopping integrals and thereby causes the tops of the out - of - plane and in - plane @xmath34 bands to move well below @xmath3 . for the theoretically stable structure , our bands in fig . 3 and fermi - surface cross sections in fig .",
    "4b are similar to those of other cuprates . comparing in detail with the calculated fs of yba@xmath2cu@xmath6o@xmath11 @xcite , where the dimple causes the saddlepoint at the fermi level ( that of the odd plane band ) to be bifurcated by @xmath58 to the positions @xmath59",

    "( the difference between the saddlepoints at @xmath61=@xmath63 and @xmath61=0 in cacuo@xmath2 is due to the opposite @xmath61-dispersions of the @xmath28 and @xmath34 bands . )    by comparison of the fs cross - sections in figs 4a and b , we see that the static buckle squares up the ( 10)-oriented cross sections and thus creates _ large , flat _ (",
    "100)- and ( 010)-oriented pieces on the fs , centered near respectively @xmath64 and @xmath65    the calculated instability suggests that out - of - plane buckling occurs generally in such materials when the fermi level is lowered to the top of the @xmath34 bands .",
    "inclusion of the coulomb correlations , would presumably cause such instabilities to occur at lower doping levels than we predict with the lda because , in a mean - field treatment , the energy of the majority - spin cu @xmath21 orbital is lowered .",
    "the striped anti - ferromagnetic low - temperature - tetragonal ( af - ltt ) phases recently found by neutron scattering in @xmath66-doped la@xmath2cuo@xmath67 @xcite and the local buckling instabilities found in 15 per cent doped la@xmath2cuo@xmath67 by exafs @xcite are presumably examples of this .",
    "only when pinned , do the af stripes seem to be decremental to superconductivity .",
    "we now present the phonon dispersions calculated for the doped compound .",
    "we use newly developed linear - response full - potential lmto method @xcite whose accuracy was proven on lattice - dynamical , superconducting , and transport properties for a large variety of metals @xcite .",
    "the theoretical lattice constants were used in this calculation since the shallowness of the b@xmath49-well calculated with the experimental parameters casts serious doubts on the validity of the harmonic approximation .",
    "the technical details of this calculation can be found elsewhere @xcite .    from the calculated phonon dispersions in fig . 5",
    ", we first notice that the structure is stable .",
    "secondly , we notice that a low frequency ( 1.8 thz ) mode exists near the point m. this mode is quadrupolar with the oxygen squares rotated around the copper atoms .",
    "it can also be viewed as an in - plane buckling mode and is strongly coupled to the in - plane @xmath34 bands .",
    "the mode also involves displacements of the ca atoms in the z - direction .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the structure with flat planes , this quadrupolar mode is unstable ( at m , @xmath68 = 3.7@xmath69 thz ) .",
    "this is connected with the atypical feature near point a of the band structure in fig . 1 . here",
    "again we see that , for structural stability of this compound , out - of - plane distortion is required .",
    "a large amount of theoretical work has been done to estimate the epi in the cuprates using the frozen - phonon approach @xcite , the rigid - muffin - tin @xcite , and tight - binding approximations @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are numerous attempts to deduce the strength of the epi from experiments @xcite .",
    "so far , no general agreement is reached , although the lda frozen - phonon calculations @xcite for selected , high - symmetry phonons in yba@xmath2cu@xmath6o@xmath11 and optimally doped la@xmath2cuo@xmath67 indicate that @xmath40.5 - 1.5 .",
    "compared herewith , our linear - response method is more accurate because it allows calculation for arbitrary phonon wave vectors @xmath48 . we have checked this method on epis for a large number of classical superconductors @xcite and the results indicate that , granted the lda , we can obtain reliable estimates of @xmath70 for the high - t@xmath71 materials .    due to the recent experimental evidence for @xmath21 symmetry of the gap @xcite , we have calculated the strength of the epi in a general @xmath72-channel .",
    "we use a standard expression for the mode dependent coupling : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the average over the brillouin zone , @xmath75 is the electronic @xmath72-density of states per spin at the fermi level @xmath76 @xmath77 is the phonon line - width due to epi in the @xmath72-channel , @xmath78 is the phonon energy , and we have used rydberg units . for the electronic energies , @xmath79 we have dropped the band index @xmath80 because the fs of cacuo@xmath2 has only one sheet . the approximation in the second line of ( [ e1 ] )",
    "is , that the bands are linear in the range @xmath81 this approximation ought to be scrutinized in a future work . finally , the coupling constant @xmath82 is the sum over all phonon branches @xmath83 and the average over the brillouin zone .",
    "5 shows @xmath84 for the different phonon branches as a function of @xmath48 along high - symmetry directions .",
    "the epi is seen to be particularly large for the buckling modes ( the two uppermost of the branches marked by circles )",
    ". remember that for flat planes , these contributions to the epi would vanish .",
    "it is furthermore seen that the epi is strongly enhanced along @xmath25x , and peaks near @xmath25x/3 reaching a maximum of about 2.5 .",
    "this is partly due to nesting corresponding to _ sliding _ of the nearly flat ( 100)- or ( 010)-oriented part of the fs on itself , or on the part parallel to it and displaced by @xmath85 or @xmath86 respectively .",
    "these sliding - nestings cause @xmath87 to be large near the following flat regions of @xmath48-space : @xmath88 @xmath89 and @xmath90 with @xmath91 and @xmath92 considerably smaller than @xmath93 and @xmath94 considerably smaller than @xmath95 this kind of nesting enhancement is well - known in the theory of htsc @xcite .",
    "a second reason for the peaking of @xmath84near @xmath25x/3 is a particular wave - vector dependence the ep coupling constants @xmath96 for the buckling modes ; this we shall return to in the next section where we consider the tight - binding model . from fig .",
    "5 we see that the epi is small in other points of the brillouin zone . averaging over 15 @xmath48-points in the @xmath25xm - plane yields : @xmath97=0@xmath98 and averaging over the zra - plane gives : @xmath99=@xmath100 .",
    "these values are respectively upper and lower bounds for @xmath101 averaged over all @xmath48 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath102  is too small to account for the high - temperature superconductivity in doped cacuo@xmath103    finally , we discuss our calculation of the @xmath1-channel epis . using eqs .",
    "( [ e1]-[e2 ] ) we have analyzed all symmetry - allowed channels of superconductivity and came to the conclusion that , apart from the @xmath0-channel , relatively large positive values of @xmath104 are only obtained for pair - function symmetry @xmath21 . note that if @xmath105 were a constant , independent of @xmath106 and @xmath107 @xmath104 would vanish for @xmath108 the @xmath109are presented in fig .",
    "6 and may be compared with @xmath84 in fig .",
    "also for @xmath109 there is a strong enhancement near @xmath25x/3 and , in particular , for the buckling modes .",
    "it is also seen that near the m - point , @xmath110 vanishes for the buckling modes and is negative for all other modes .",
    "averaging over @xmath48 in the @xmath25xm and zra planes give respectively : @xmath111 and @xmath112=@xmath113 these values are _ positive _ and only _",
    "slightly smaller _ than the corresponding values of @xmath114 .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling is thus _",
    "highly anisotropic _ in 24 per cent hole - doped cacuo@xmath2 , and probably in all htscs near optimal doping .",
    "in the bottom part of fig . 7 we specify an electronic 8-band orthogonal tight - binding hamiltonian for a single , dimpled cuo@xmath2 plane , which we feel is generic for cuo@xmath2-htsc s and contains the relevant degrees of freedom . in the upper part",
    ", we synthesize the eight plane - bands .",
    "this hamiltonian was originally @xcite derived from the lda bands of yba@xmath2cu@xmath6o@xmath11 by integrating out the very - high - energy degrees of freedom , neglecting the chains , and projecting onto one plane ( or , for a bi - layer , to the even or the odd linear - combination , or , for an infinite - layer , to a single @xmath61 ) @xcite .",
    "we have recently @xcite deduced the parameter values of this hamiltonian for a number of further htsc s and showed that ( apart from fermi - level position ) the only strongly material - dependent parameters are the energy @xmath115 of the cu@xmath116 hybrid @xcite , which depends on the distance of apical oxygen from plane copper , and the integral of hopping @xmath117 from the cu@xmath30 orbital to an o@xmath118 orbital , which is proportional to the buckling - angle @xmath119 for simplicity , we assume tetragonal symmetry in fig.7 as well as in most of the following . for a discussion of the inter - plane hopping , we refer to ref .",

    "value for @xmath231 at x , but it _ vanishes _ for @xmath106 at x and @xmath232 at y. this is exactly what is needed for the electron - phonon interaction to support @xmath21-pairing .",

    "the integral ( [ e7 ] ) , as well as the one for the normal density of states , @xmath253 may be expressed analytically in terms of elliptic integrals if we use a band structure with @xmath254 i.e. the 4-band model .",

    "we conclude that the linear electron - phonon interaction for buckled planes may support , but is hardly sufficient to cause , high - temperature superconductivity based on @xmath21-pairing .",
    "the most important mode seems to be the buckling mode , because it modulates the saddlepoints of the energy bands where the density of states is high and where the superconducting gap is observed to be maximum .",
    "moreover , the buckling mode does not interact with the electrons for @xmath48 near @xmath258 where the coulomb repulsion is maximum .",
    "considering the facts that the linear epi for the buckling mode is proportional to the small static ( on the scale of phonon frequencies ) buckling , and that this mode is calculated to be highly anharmonic , it seems imminent to investigate the role of anharmonicity .",
