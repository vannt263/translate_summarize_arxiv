    "in recent studies , the idea of establishing the existence of so - called  critical elements \" ( or the earlier  minimal blow - up solutions \" ) has led to significant progress in the theory of  critical \" dispersive and hyperbolic equations such as the energy - critical nonlinear schr \" odinger equation @xcite , mass - critical nonlinear schr \" odinger equation @xcite , @xmath0-critical nonlinear schr \" odinger equation @xcite , energy - critical nonlinear wave equation @xcite , energy - critical and mass - critical hartree equations @xcite and energy - critical wave maps @xcite .",
    "+   + in this paper we exhibit the generality of the method of  critical elements \" by applying it to a parabolic system , namely the standard . ] navier - stokes equations ( nse ) : @xmath5 typically , @xmath6 is interpreted as the velocity vector field of a fluid filling a region in space , and @xmath7 is the associated scalar pressure function . +   + the  critical \" spaces are those which are invariant under the natural scaling of the equation . for nse , if @xmath8 is a solution , then so is @xmath9 for any @xmath10 .",
    "the critical spaces are of the type @xmath11 , where @xmath12 . for the navier - stokes equations , one can take , for example , @xmath13 or the smaller space @xmath14 .",
    "in fact , one has the  chain of critical spaces \" given by the continuous embeddings @xmath15 these are the spaces in which the initial data of solutions in the critical settings live , and we will also refer to them as  critical spaces \"  that is , spaces of functions on @xmath16 whose norms satisfy @xmath17 . +   + in the recent important paper @xcite , l. escauriaza , g. seregin and v. ver ' ak showed that any  leray - hopf \" weak solution which remains bounded in @xmath18 can not develop a singularity in finite time .",
    "their proof used a blow - up procedure and reduction to a backwards uniqueness question for the heat equation , and was then completed using carleman - type inequalities and the theory of unique continuation . here ,",
    "we approach the same problem using the method of  critical elements \" .",
    "although we do also use the main tools appearing in @xcite to complete our proof , we hope that it is more intuitively clear in our exposition why those particular tools are needed .",
    "+   + the precise statement of the main result we address in this paper is the following :    [ thm : regularity ] let @xmath19 satisfy @xmath20 and let @xmath21 be the associated `` mild solution '' to nse satisfying @xmath22 .",
    "suppose that there is some @xmath23 such that @xmath24 for all @xmath25 such that @xmath6 is defined",
    ". then @xmath6 is defined ( and smooth ) for all positive times .",
    "( theorem [ thm : regularity ] of course follows from the result in @xcite . )",
    "we believe the methods given below will work as well if we replace @xmath0 by @xmath26 in theorem [ thm : regularity ] and hence can be used to give an alternative proof of the result in @xcite in the case of mild solutions . for technical reasons ( described below ) we start with the above result and plan to return to the more general case in a future publication .",
    "+   + the  mild solutions \" to nse which we consider in our approach have the form @xmath27 for some divergence - free initial datum @xmath28 , with the linear solution operator @xmath29 and nonlinearity @xmath30 given by @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the convolution of @xmath28 with the heat kernel , and the equation ( [ eem ] ) , ( [ ns1 ] ) comes formally from applying the helmholtz projection operator @xmath33 to ( [ eq : nsea ] ) which fixes @xmath34 and eliminates the term @xmath35 , and then solving the resulting non - homogeneous heat equation by duhamel s formula . under sufficient regularity assumptions , mild solutions",
    "are in fact classical solutions , and the existence of such a solution on some time interval is typically established via the contraction - mapping principle in an appropriate function space .",
    "+   + we follow the method of c. kenig and f. merle . in a series of recent works @xcite",
    ", they use the method of  critical elements \" to approach the question of global existence and  scattering \" ( approaching a linear solution at large times ) for nonlinear hyperbolic and dispersive equations in critical settings .",
    "for example , for the 3d non - linear schr \" odinger equation @xmath36 ( nls ) , they considered ( [ eem ] ) with @xmath37 the free schr \" odinger operator , and both @xmath38 ( the focusing case ) , and @xmath39 ( the defocusing case ) , the exponents needed for the  @xmath40-critical \" and  @xmath41-critical \" settings , respectively .",
    "note that in the case ( [ nls3 ] ) of cubic nonlinearity , the equation is invariant under the same scaling as the navier - stokes equations .",
    "+   + in all cases , the general strategy was essentially the same , which we ll describe now in the @xmath0 setting : +   + for any @xmath42 , one uses fixed - point arguments to assign a maximal time @xmath43 such that a solution @xmath6 to ( [ eem ] ) which remains in @xmath0 for positive time exists and is unique in some scaling - invariant space @xmath44 for any fixed @xmath45 , where @xmath44 denotes a space of functions defined on the space - time region @xmath46 .",
    "define @xmath47 the type of result proved in @xcite ( variants of which were proved in @xcite and which we will prove here as well ) is that @xmath48 implies that @xmath49 and @xmath50 as @xmath51 for some @xmath52 . in other words ,",
    "@xmath6 exists globally and scatters .",
    "typically this is known to be true for @xmath53 for sufficiently small @xmath54 . in the case of nse",
    ", the scattering condition is replaced by decay to zero in norm  in other words , we set @xmath55 . for globally defined @xmath0-valued solutions ,",
    "such decay was proved in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "+   + it is worth pointing out that the @xmath0 decay , which is proved quite easily in @xcite by decomposing the initial data into a large part in @xmath56 and a small part in @xmath0 , solving the corresponding equations and employing the standard energy arguments , is actually used heavily in our proofs , and significantly reduces the difficulty from the nls case treated in @xcite .",
    "+   + the general method of proof , which can be referred to as `` concentration - compactness '' @xmath1 `` rigidity '' , is comprised of the following three main steps for a proof by contradiction : +    1 .",
    "+   + assuming a finite maximal threshold @xmath57 for which @xmath58 implies global existence and scattering but such a statement fails for any @xmath59 , there exists a solution @xmath60 with @xmath61 , for which global existence or scattering fails .",
    "+   + such a critical element @xmath60 produces a  compact family \"  that is , up to norm - invariant rescalings and translations in space ( and possibly in time ) , the set @xmath62 is pre - compact in a critical space .",
    "3 .    +   + the existence of the compact family produces a contradiction to known results .",
    "+    steps 1 - 2 are accomplished by considering a minimizing sequence of solutions @xmath63 with initial data @xmath64 such that @xmath65 , @xmath66 for which global existence or scattering fails ( typically quantified by @xmath67 ) .",
    "+   + then the main tool for realizing this program is a  profile decomposition \" associated to that sequence , which explores the lack of compactness in the embedding @xmath68 .",
    "for example , in @xcite the following decomposition ( based on @xcite ) was used for treatment of the nls case : there exists a sequence @xmath69 , with associated linear solutions @xmath70 , and sequences of scales @xmath71 and shifts @xmath72 and @xmath73 , such that ( after a subsequence in @xmath74 ) @xmath75 where the  profiles \" in the sum are orthogonal in a certain sense due to the choices of @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and @xmath79 is a small error for large @xmath80 and @xmath74 . ( from this , a similar decomposition is then established for the time evolution of @xmath81 . ) using this setup , it is shown that in fact the solution to nls with initial datum @xmath82 is a critical element for some @xmath83 , which establishes step 1 .",
    "compactness ( step 2 ) is established using the same tools .",
    "( we will discuss step 3 momentarily . )",
    "+   + our ultimate goal here is to give such a proof in the context of the navier - stokes equations , where we would consider ( [ eem ] ) , ( [ ns1 ] ) for @xmath84 , with @xmath85;{l^3(\\mathbb{r}^3 ) } ) \\cap l^5({\\mathbb{r}^3}\\times ( 0,t))$ ] and @xmath86 defined accordingly , and @xmath87 since a profile decomposition has already been established by i. gallagher in @xcite for solutions to the navier - stokes equations evolving from a bounded set in @xmath0 ( based on the decomposition for the initial data in @xcite ) , we restrict ourselves in this paper to the case of data in @xmath0 .",
    "we expect that the result in @xcite can be extended to the @xmath88 setting , which would then allow for an extension of our approach to that case .",
    "we plan to return to this in a future publication profile decomposition has been established by the second author in @xcite , and the program in @xmath89 has been completed in a collaboration of the second author with i. gallagher and f. planchon , to appear soon . ] .",
    "+   + we take @xmath90;{{\\dot h^\\frac{1}{2}}}({\\mathbb{r}^3 } ) ) \\cap l^2((0,t);{{\\dot h^\\frac{3}{2}}}({\\mathbb{r}^3}))\\ ] ] and as before let @xmath91 the profile decomposition of @xcite for solutions corresponding to a bounded sequence @xmath92 of divergence - free fields takes the form ( after a subsequence in @xmath74 ) @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the solutions to the navier - stokes equations with initial data @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively , and @xmath79 and @xmath98 are again small errors for large @xmath80 and @xmath74 .",
    "( we remark that the absence in the above decomposition of the time shifts @xmath99 which appeared in ( [ prof ] ) greatly simplifies matters on a technical level ; in @xcite , this was a significant consideration . )",
    "the above program is then completed in theorems [ thm : a ] , [ thm : b ] and [ thm : c ] as follows : +   + by known local - existence and small - data results , there exists a small @xmath100 such that @xmath101 implies that the solution exists for all time and tends to zero in the @xmath102 norm .",
    "we thereby assume a finite critical value @xmath103 ( as in step 1 ) such that any solution @xmath6 with @xmath58 must exist globally and decay to zero in @xmath102 , and @xmath104 is the maximum such value .",
    "+   + the failure of the global existence and decay property , which occurs for some solution @xmath6 with @xmath105 for any @xmath59 , is expressed by @xmath106 , where we define for @xmath107 @xmath108 (",
    "so @xmath109 whenever @xmath110  and therefore also , by standard embeddings , @xmath111 so such solutions are smooth by the  ladyzhenskaya - prodi - serrin condition \" , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+   + in theorems [ thm : a ] and [ thm : b ] , we establish the existence of a solution (  critical element \" ) @xmath60 with initial datum @xmath112 and @xmath113 such that @xmath114 and , further , that for any such solution , there exist @xmath115 , @xmath116 as @xmath117 and @xmath118 such that , for @xmath119 and @xmath120 , @xmath121 is pre - compact in @xmath122 .",
    "+   + the pre - compactness in @xmath26 of such a @xmath123 is shown to be inconsistent with @xmath124 in theorem [ thm : c ] , by using the backwards uniqueness results for parabolic equations established in @xcite as well as the theory of unique continuation for parabolic equations to show that in fact @xmath125 .",
    "( in general , step 3 requires something specific to the particular case being studied  for example the morawetz - type estimate for nls used in @xcite  as opposed to the methods used to establish steps 1 and 2 which are fairly general in nature . ) +   + one interesting scenario in which such a @xmath123 would be compact in @xmath26 is if , in ( [ eq : kay ] ) , one could take @xmath126 for some @xmath127 ( with @xmath128 ) , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , and one imposes that @xmath131 ( i.e. , @xmath132 ) for some given non - zero @xmath133 .",
    "this is the case of a  self - similar \" solution which was first ruled out in the important paper @xcite by j. neas , m. ruika and v. ver ' ak in the ( spatially global ) @xmath26 setting ( see @xcite for more general results ) .",
    "theorem [ thm : c ] can therefore be thought of as a generalization of the result in @xcite .",
    "( such solutions are of course ruled out as well by the more recent paper @xcite , but the proof here is much simpler for that purpose . ) +   + * acknowledgements : * we would like to thank professors isabelle gallagher and vladim ' ir ver ' ak for many helpful comments and discussions . the second author would like to extend a personal and special thank you as well to vladim ' ir ver ' ak for his continuing help , guidance and support .",
