    "<S> the separate quark flavour contributions to the pion and kaon valence quark distribution functions are studied , along with the corresponding electromagnetic form factors in the space - like region . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are made using the solution of the bethe - salpeter equation for the model of nambu and jona - lasinio with proper - time regularization . </S>",
    "<S> both the pion and kaon form factors and the valence quark distribution functions reproduce many of the features of the available empirical data . the larger mass if the strange quark naturally explains the empirical fact that the ratio @xmath0 drops below unity at large @xmath1 , with a value of approximately @xmath2 as @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> with regard to the elastic form factors we report a large flavour dependence , with the @xmath4-quark contribution to the kaon form factor being an order of magnitude smaller than that of the @xmath5-quark at large @xmath6 , which may be a sensitive measure of confinement effects in qcd . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly though , the total @xmath7 and @xmath8 form factors differ by only 10% . </S>"
