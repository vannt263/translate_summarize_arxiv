    "<S> suppose moreover that the shared secret is to be recovered by these subgroups _ only when all parties _ within each group collaborate ( so that it is unnecessary to trust all parties within each group ) . a possibility to achieve this consists in : </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) the @xmath1 parties share ( many copies of ) @xmath44 , ( ii ) each party randomly measures either the @xmath23 or the @xmath24 observable , ( iii ) the @xmath1 parties are _ randomly _ separated into two groups and all parties assigned to the same group collaborate to compare their inputs and outputs , ( iv ) both _ groups _ announce their sum of inputs , </S>",
    "<S> ( v ) parties in the same group compute the product of their measurement outcome and deduce , using eq .  , the shared secret bit upon learning the sum of inputs of the other group , ( vi ) parties in one group use the shared secret keys to encrypt the message and send it to the other .    in the device - independent setting , </S>",
    "<S> security analysis is carried out by treating each physical subsystem together with their measurement device as a black box ; conclusions are drawn directly from the measurement statistics . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the above protocol does not rely on the assumption of a ghz state nor the particular measurements being performed , but rather the strong correlation present in eq .    for the right combination of inputs , the product of outputs are perfectly ( anti ) correlated . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the protocol essentially works by first distributing the correlated data needed to establish the secret keys , and performing the secret sharing  @xcite between any two complementary subgroups of the @xmath1 participating parties as they deem fit . </S>",
    "<S> since the product of outcomes for each group is uniformly random , the protocol is secure against cheating by any dishonest parties within the group ; no one can retrieve the shared key without collaborating with everyone else within the same group . </S>",
    "<S> what about eavesdropping by an external , post - quantum but non - signaling adversary eve ?    since the ghz correlations of eq .   </S>",
    "<S> are biseparable , a naive attack by eve may consist in preparing for the @xmath1 parties the biseparable , non - signaling boxes that reproduces exactly eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in the tripartite case , in accordance with the biseparable decomposition , she would prepare with equal probability 4 different versions of a deterministic box for one of the parties , and correspondingly 4 different versions of a pr box for the remaining two parties . </S>",
    "<S> if the decomposition that she chooses matches exactly the way the parties are separated into two groups , then after step ( iv ) , she learns exactly the key and hence the message shared by these parties . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the grouping is decided only after the measurement phase , she can guess the bipartition correctly only with a chance of @xmath45 in the tripartite case , and more generally @xmath46 in the @xmath1-partite scenario . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , this guessing probability rapidly approaches 0 as @xmath1 increases , making it extremely difficult for eve to succeed with this eavesdropping strategy for large @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ application ii : bipartite leakage - resilient qkd._next , let us describe a quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocol between two parties , a and b , which is as leakage - resilient  @xcite as one could hope for . </S>",
    "<S> the protocol consists of : ( i ) preparation of many copies of @xmath44 , ( ii ) for each of these @xmath1-partite systems , a _ randomly chosen subset _ , say , @xmath42 of the @xmath1 subsystems </S>",
    "<S> are distributed to a , while the remaining @xmath47 subsystems are distributed to b , ( iii ) for each of these subsystems , a and b randomly measure @xmath23 or @xmath24 , ( iv ) both _ parties _ announce their sum of inputs , ( v ) for each @xmath1-partite system distributed from the source , a and b compute the product of their local measurement outcomes and deduce , using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> , the shared secret bit upon learning the sum of inputs of the other party .    as with the mss protocol described above </S>",
    "<S> , the secret key is established through the perfect ( anti ) correlation present in the product of the outputs . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> the gist of the protocol only relies on the correlation given by eq .  , rather than the actual state and measurement giving rise to this correlation , rendering the protocol ideal for device - independent analysis </S>",
    "<S> however , in contrast with usual device - independent cryptography where leakage of information is not allowed , the above protocol is as leakage - resilient as one can hope for  the adversary eve can certainly recover the secret key if all the output bits from either party leak to her , but if she misses merely one output bit from each party , the additional information that she gains from the leakage can not improve her guess of the secret key . now , </S>",
    "<S> if we _ assume _ that eve has no control over how the subsystems are distributed in step ( ii ) but otherwise only constrained by the non - signaling principle , then as with the mss protocol , for @xmath1 sufficiently large , her advantage of preparing some biseparable , non - signaling boxes for a & b is minimal .    _ </S>",
    "<S> discussion._ let us now comment on some possible directions for future research . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , we have only provided intuitions on why the protocols proposed above may be secure even in a device - independent setting . for odd @xmath0 , since the ghz correlations violate the mermin - bell inequality maximally ( see appendix [ app : biv ] ) , the result of franz _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite implies that these correlations are necessarily monogamous with respect to any potential quantum eavesdropper . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly suggests that if we assume an independent - and - identically - distributed ( i.i.d ) scenario , a formal security proof of these protocols against a quantum adversary may be given even in the case with noisy correlations , , the anl of @xmath48 is also extremely robust to noise . ] and in a device - independent setting . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , a security proof without this assumption is even more desirable , and a possible path towards this is to prove that the protocols are even secure against an adversary that is only constrained by the non - signaling principle  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our arguments on why the protocols are not immediately susceptible to a straightforward attack by such an eavesdropper , despite the fact that the correlations are biseparable , is an evidence pointing in this direction .    for leakage - resilient qkd , one could also imagine , instead of the above protocol , doing an existing qkd protocol many times in parallel and then using the xor of the secret key bits to generate the final secret key . </S>",
    "<S> although such a protocol requires many more qubits to establish the final secret key , it can clearly offer high level of leakage resilience . how would such a protocol perform compared with the above protocol based on @xmath44 ? </S>",
    "<S> this certainly deserves some further investigation .    </S>",
    "<S> coming back to anl itself , let us note that the requirement of ( 1 ) nonlocality and ( 2 ) biseparability with respect to all bipartitions _ may arguably not _ </S>",
    "<S> , by themselves , imply that an outsider can not attribute unambiguously the nonlocality to _ any definite subset(s ) _ of the @xmath1 parties . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , one may start with the tripartite ghz correlation @xmath49 , cf . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  , and trivially construct an example @xmath50 for arbitrary @xmath1 parties by introducing parties that are uncorrelated with the first three . </S>",
    "<S> while such an @xmath1-partite correlation @xmath51 indeed satisfies the two requirements stated above , one can unambiguously attribute the nonlocality present only to the three parties that give rise to @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that such an identification is _ incomplete _ since the production of such a biseparable correlation only requires the nonlocal collaboration between two parties , and it is still impossible for an outsider to determine which two parties have collaborated nonlocally in producing the given correlation ( fig .  [ fig : polytopes ] and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : anl ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> a more precise definition of anl may thus require also a specification of the extent ( size ) of the nonlocal resource needed in producing the given correlation , a task that shall be pursued elsewhere  @xcite . for our ghz examples , except for the cases where @xmath1 is even with @xmath52 odd , it can be shown ( see appendix  [ app : m - sep ] ) using the result of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the correlations of eq .   </S>",
    "<S> are not triseparable , i.e. , not producible by a partitioning of the parties into three groups ( where only parties within the same group are allowed to collaborate nonlocally ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the generation of these correlations indeed requires the nonlocal collaboration of at least @xmath53 parties in one group ; an analogous statement for the remaining cases would be desirable .    </S>",
