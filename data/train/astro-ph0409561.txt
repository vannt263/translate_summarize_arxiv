    "grs 1915 + 105 is one of the most fascinating x - ray sources in our galaxy .",
    "it is the biggest stellar mass black hole ( bh ) with a mass of 14@xmath04.4 m@xmath1 ( harlaftis and greiner 2004 ) , one of the brightest x - ray sources , and a definite source of apparent superluminal ejection ( mirabel & rodrguez 1994 ) .",
    "an up - to - date accurate review of the source can be found in fender & belloni ( 2004 ) .",
    "+ since the launch of the _ integral _ observatory we have monitored the source with dedicated simultaneous _ integral _ and _ rxte _ pointed observations but also , most of the time , with ( nearly ) simultaneous observations from the ground in the radio and/or infrared domain . while our second year of monitoring is about to start , we report here the results of the first year of this programme focusing mainly on the data acquired in march - may 2003 during an unprecedented high energy coverage ( fig . [",
    "fig : lc ] )",
    "the source is extremely variable in both the soft and hard x - rays ( hannikainen et al .",
    "2003 , top left panel of fig . [",
    "fig : rev48spec ] ) , while the average spectrum is very soft .",
    "our preliminary analysis showed that the source was in a class of variability never observed before ( hannikainen et al .",
    "2003 ) showing high spikes with quasi periodic period of about 5 minutes , hard rises and soft declines . while a first spectral analysis of an average spectrum was given in hannikainen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the variability implies a better definition of the good time interval from which to accumulate spectra if one wants to understand the origin of the variations . with rxte / pca we produced spectra every 16  s and fitted them with a simple model of multi colour disc black body and a power law , while we accumulated spectra from integral / jem - x and isgri from the high level and the low level ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rev48spec ] , hannikainen et al .",
    "2005 , in prep . ) .",
    "the best fit parameters obtained from the integral spectra are kt@xmath2=1.42@xmath00.03 kev and @xmath3 for the high luminosity periods , and kt@xmath4 kev and @xmath5 for the low luminosity one . while we can see a slight evolution of the disc temperature and the powerlaw photon index , the inner radius of the disc stays approximatively the same .",
    "the flux of the power law however changes drastically .",
    "it seems , therefore , that the variability of this class , unlike most of the others , is driven by changes in the powerlaw component usually attributed to comptonisation of the disc photons by a `` corona '' .",
    "this is compatible with the pca analysis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rev48spec ] ) where no apparent correlation between the disc parameters and the spikes are visible , while the variations of the powerlaw photon index may be tightly linked to changes of luminosity .",
    "analysis of this observation with more physical elaborated models is in progress ( hannikainen et al . 2005 , in prep . ) .",
    "from _ integral _ revolution 53 on , grs 1915 + 105 was found in its steady `` hard '' state ( class @xmath6 from belloni et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the huge multi - wavelength campaigns performed during revolutions 57 and 62 ( fuchs et al . 2003 , 2005 , in prep .",
    ") revealed the simultaneous presence of a strong compact jet , a hard x - ray tail , and strong quasi periodic oscillation ( qpo , at least during revolution 57 when we had simultaneous _",
    "rxte _ observations ) , while monitoring with the ryle telescope showed that the source was very active in radio at the same time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ) . the analysis of our whole _ rxte _ data set revealed the presence of strong low frequency qpos ( lfqpo ) in each observation with frequencies between 1 - 2.5 hz , and amplitudes between 11.5 - 15 % rms ( rodriguez et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "unlike usually observed no correlation was found between the source count rate and the qpo frequency .",
    "we studied the energy dependence of the qpo amplitude ( qpo spectra ) in 22 spectral bins .",
    "this allowed us to perform spectral fits and we showed that although the source spectral parameters were similar in all _ rxte _ observations , the qpo spectra differed markedly ( rodriguez et al .",
    "2004 ) : while in the first observation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qpospec ] , right ) an obvious cut - off was found ( at @xmath7 kev ) , in the following ones the cut - off energy either evolved towards higher energy ( up to @xmath8 kev ) , or simply disappeared .",
    "+ our spectral studies revealed that the spectra of grs 1915 + 105 could be well represented by a thermal comptonisation component , and an extra powerlaw accounting for emission at higher energies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qpospec ] , left ) .",
    "while quite puzzling , those results , and especially the evolution of the cut - off energy in the qpo spectra can be easily understood if we assume that part of the hard x - rays are emitted by the compact jet ( through direct synchrotron or synchrotron self - compton as expected see e.g. markoff & nowak 2004 ) , while another part would come from inverse comptonisation on the basis of the jet . in this context",
    "the qpo would originate in the latter component , while the jet emission would not contain any modulation .",
    "the qpo spectra would therefore be due to the relative contribution of both components to the total x - ray spectrum : the stronger the jet , the lower the cut - off energy of the qpo , and vice - versa .",
    "+ we point out that this interpretation qualitatively matches several observational / theoretical facts .",
    "the compact jet model has succesfully been used in the fitting of different bh binaries ( e.g. markoff et al .",
    "2001 ) . in grs 1915 + 105 ,",
    "there is a need for an additional parameter to account for the hardest part of the spectrum .",
    "the compact jet is detected ( fuchs et al . 2003 ) , and is strongest when the qpo cut - off energy is the lowest ( rodriguez et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the qpo spectral shape seems to be qualitatively the same as the relative contribution of the comptonised component to the overall spectrum ( fig .",
