    "among the long - standing problems in physics , a fundamental one , from a theoretical point of view , is the absence of a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "even if a lot of work has been devoted , especially in the direction of string theory and subsequent modifications , i.e. the branes , a complete scheme is still lacking . on the other hand in the traditional path",
    "integral approach to quantum gravity , a typical problem is that the generating functional @xmath1 \\exp is_{g}\\left [ g_{\\mu \\nu } \\right ] \\label{p01}\\ ] ] is ill defined because @xmath2 $ ] does not represent a measure and moreover there is no convergence .",
    "however , in the context of a wkb approximation with a fixed background , one can obtain interesting informations .",
    "indeed , if one considers a background @xmath3 , the gravitational field splits into @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a quantum fluctuation around the background field .",
    "@xmath6 becomes @xmath7 \\simeq \\exp is_{g}\\left [ \\bar{g}_{\\mu \\nu } \\right ] \\int { \\cal d}h_{\\mu \\nu } \\exp is_{g}^{\\left ( 2\\right ) } \\left [ h_{\\mu \\nu } \\right ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath8 $ ] is the action approximated to second order . in the context of the euclidean path integration ,",
    "last expression becomes @xmath9 \\right ) \\simeq \\exp \\left ( -i_{g}\\left [ \\bar{g}_{\\mu \\nu } \\right ] \\right ) \\int { \\cal d}h_{\\mu \\nu } \\exp \\left ( -i_{g}^{\\left ( 2\\right ) } \\left [ h_{\\mu \\nu } \\right ] \\right ) .\\ ] ] previous equation can be cast in the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the decay probability per unit volume and time , while @xmath12 is the prefactor coming from the saddle point evaluation and @xmath13 is the classical part of the action .",
    "if a single negative eigenvalue appears in the prefactor @xmath12 , it means that the related bounce shifts the energy of the false ground state@xcite . in particular , it is possible to discuss decay probabilities from one spacetime to another one @xcite . for certain classes of gravitational backgrounds , namely the static spherically symmetric metrics , it could be interesting the use of other methods based on variational approach . in a series of papers ,",
    "we have used such an approach to show that a model of spacetime foam can be concretely realized if one considers a collection of schwarzschild wormholes whose energy is given by a casimir energy@xcite .",
    "we recall that the casimir energy involves a subtraction procedure between zero point energies having the same boundary conditions . in this paper",
    "we would like to apply such methods to another class of static spherically symmetric wormholes involving the electromagnetic field .",
    "this class is described by the reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) metric which is a solution of the einstein - maxwell equations with two basic parameters : a mass @xmath14 and a charge @xmath15 .",
    "together with the schwarzschild metric also the rn metric shares the property of being asymptotically flat .",
    "this means that the casimir energy computation for such wormholes class will be made with flat space as a reference space .",
    "the final expression will be compared with that one obtained for the schwarzschild wormholes showing that the casimir energy for rn wormholes is always higher than the casimir energy for the schwarzschild wormholes .",
    "this means that rn wormholes can not be taken as a representation of the ground state of a foamy spacetime . to this purpose",
    "we will fix our attention to the following quantity @xmath16 representing the total energy computed to one - loop in a rn background .",
    "@xmath17 is the reference space energy , which in this case is flat space . @xmath18",
    "is the energy difference between the rn and the flat metrics , stored in the boundaries and @xmath19 is the quantum correction to the classical term .",
    "the analogy between @xmath19 and the prefactor of eq.@xmath20 is the key to obtain information about instability . indeed",
    "if we discover that the spectrum of the second order differential operator associated with the quantum fluctuations of transverse and traceless tensors ( tt ) admits bound states , then we have instability . in this paper",
    "we will assume that only one unstable mode appears in the spectrum of tt tensors ; this is sufficient to apply coleman arguments about transition from a vacuum to another one .",
    "note that with this assumption we are in the worst situation , namely the schwarzschild and rn wormholes can be compared .",
    "in fact without the negative mode a spontaneous transition from vacuum to vacuum can not happen .",
    "therefore in this framework , it is sufficient to compute the stable part of the casimir energy to compare these different pictures . to concretely compute eq.@xmath21 we refer to the following hamiltonian with boundary @xmath22 where @xmath0 is the _ lapse _ function",
    ", @xmath23 is the _ shift _ function and @xmath24 @xmath25 is the energy - momentum tensor contribution of the electromagnetic field .",
    "@xmath26 represents the energy stored into the boundary .",
    "since the metric considered has no off - diagonal elements , the hamiltonian becomes @xmath27 however the physical quantity of interest is the casimir energy .",
    "therefore we will consider the following expectation value @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the total hamiltonians referred to the rn and flat spacetimes respectively for the volume term@xcite and @xmath31 is a _ trial wave functional _ of the gaussian form .",
    "note that the flat space is a particular case of the rn space with the parameters @xmath32 . since the reference space is the same one of the schwarzschild space , it is immediate to recognize that if an instability appears , flat space could decay via a schwarzschild black hole pair creation or via a reissner - nordstrm black hole pair creation .",
    "therefore to give indications about the  _ ground state ",
    "_ of a foamy spacetime , it is important to establish if @xmath33 to one - loop approximation .",
    "it is important to remark that it is the vacuum energy difference with the same asymptotic reference space that gives the possibility to choose which vacuum is appropriate and not the direct energy difference between these possible candidates .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows : in section [ p1 ] , we introduce the reissner - nordstrm metric ; in section [ p2 ] , we compute the boundary energy by means of quasilocal energy ; in section [ p3 ] , a variational calculation will be set up to compute the casimir energy and in particular we will restrict our analysis to the transverse - traceless tensor metric fluctuations ( tt ) ; in section [ p4 ] , we evaluate the spectrum of the operator associated with tt tensors ( laplace - beltrami operator ) and we compare the result with what we have obtained in case of schwarzschild wormholes ; in section [ p5 ] , we summarize and conclude .",
    "units in which @xmath34 are used throughout the paper .",
    "the rn line element is @xmath35 with @xmath36 where @xmath37 ; @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the electric and magnetic charge respectively .",
    "when the electric charge is considered the electromagnetic potential assumes the form @xmath40 and the electromagnetic tensor @xmath41 is @xmath42 . in the case of a pure magnetic field ,",
    "the form is @xmath43 and the electromagnetic tensor becomes @xmath44 @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , although the gravitational potential @xmath46 assumes the same form , the gravitational perturbation contribute in a different way .",
    "when @xmath47 the metric describes the schwarzschild metric . when @xmath48 , the metric is flat . for @xmath49 , we can distinguish three different cases :    * @xmath50 . in this case",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath51 admits two real distinct solutions located at @xmath52 with @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in the wormhole language",
    ", we will say that @xmath56 is the inner throat and @xmath57 is the outer throat . in the horizon language @xmath56",
    "is a cauchy horizon and @xmath57 is an event horizon . for each root",
    "there is a surface gravity defined by @xmath58 whose values are @xmath59 and for each surface gravity there exists a bifurcation surface associated to a wormhole throat . the _ hawking temperature _ associated with the surface gravity of the event horizon is @xmath60 * @xmath61 .",
    "this is the extreme case .",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath62 admits two real coincident solutions located at @xmath63 and its form is @xmath64 .",
    "here we discover that @xmath65 and @xmath66 . *",
    "@xmath67 . in this case",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath51 admits two complex conjugate solutions located at @xmath68 respectively .",
    "cases a ) and b ) imply @xmath47 when @xmath69 .",
    "we will restrict our attention on case a ) only .",
    "quasilocal energy is defined as the value of the hamiltonian that generates unit time translations orthogonal to the two - dimensional boundary for the explicit derivation of the hamiltonian in presence of a bifurcation surface . ] , @xmath70 where @xmath71 at @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature corresponding to the reference space , which in this case is flat space . the radial coordinate @xmath74 continuous on @xmath75 is defined by @xmath76 which in its integrated form becomes @xmath77 with @xmath78 when @xmath79 .",
    "the surfaces located at @xmath57 and @xmath56 are bifurcation surfaces denoted by @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively .    in analogy with the schwarzschild case ,",
    "see fig.[f1 ] , we will restrict our analysis to the regions i and ii of fig.[f2 ] , corresponding to the bifurcation surface @xmath80 .",
    "the constant time hypersurface we will consider will be denoted by @xmath82 , where the plus sign of eq.@xmath83 is relative to @xmath84 , while the minus sign is related to @xmath85 . in @xmath86",
    "the evaluation of @xmath87 can be obtained as follows : first we consider the static einstein - rosen bridge associated to the rn space @xcite    @xmath88    where @xmath0 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 are functions of @xmath74 defined by eq.@xmath91 .",
    "second , we consider the boundary @xmath92 , located at @xmath93 , and its associated normal @xmath94 .",
    "the expression of the trace @xmath95 gives for the rn space @xmath96 note that if we make the identification @xmath97 , the line element @xmath98 reduces to the rn metric written in another form ; for our purposes the form of @xmath99 can be left unspecified .",
    "thus the computation of @xmath100 gives @xmath101 _ { |r = r}\\ ] ] @xmath102 .\\ ] ] when @xmath103 , ( and therefore @xmath104 ) , we obtain @xmath105 = m.\\ ] ] as expected , since the rn space is a.f . , we have obtained that the classical contribution to the energy is exactly the arnowitt - deser - misner mass ( adm ) @xcite . since the rn metric is a.f .",
    ", the computation of the classical energy term leads to @xmath106 which can be computed by means of quasilocal energy .",
    "thus in complete analogy with the schwarzschild case , we conclude that flat space can not decay into rn space because the associated boundary energy ( adm ) is different , for every value of the mass @xmath14 included the extreme value .",
    "however if we look at the whole hypersurface @xmath107 , the total classical energy becomes @xmath108 with @xmath109 @xmath110 here the boundaries @xmath92 and @xmath111 are located in the two disconnected regions @xmath112 and @xmath113 respectively with coordinate values @xmath114 and the trace of the extrinsic curvature in both regions is @xmath115 thus one gets @xmath116 where for @xmath117 we have used the conventions relative to @xmath85 and @xmath111 . therefore for every value of the boundary @xmath118 , ( provided we take symmetric boundary conditions with respect to the bifurcation surface ) , we have @xmath119 namely the energy is conserved . as stressed in ref.@xcite , since we have a spacetime with a bifurcation surface , the quantities @xmath120 and @xmath121 have the same relative sign , while the total energy is given by the sum @xmath122 .",
    "the energies associated to the boundaries are symmetric and they have the same relative sign while the total energy reflects the orientation reversal of the two boundaries .",
    "apparently , eq.@xmath123 seems to violate causality , because of the minus appearance in front of the expression .",
    "however , as reported in appendix[app3 ] , it is such a sign that makes the computation causality preserving .",
    "since the total classical energy is conserved we can discuss the existence of an instability .",
    "to this aim we refer to the variational approach to compute the energy density to one - loop@xcite .",
    "in previous section we have fixed our attention to the classical part of eq.@xmath21 . in this section ,",
    "we apply the same calculation scheme of refs.@xcite to compute one loop corrections to the classical rn term . like the schwarzschild case ,",
    "there appear two classical constraints @xmath124 and two _ quantum _ constraints @xmath125 for the hamiltonian respectively , which are satisfied both by the rn and flat metric on shell .",
    "@xmath126 @xmath127 is known as the _ wheeler - dewitt _ equation ( wdw ) .",
    "our purpose is the computation of @xmath128 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the total hamiltonians referred to the rn and flat spacetimes respectively for the volume term@xcite and @xmath31 is a wave functional obtained following the usual wkb expansion of the wdw solution . in this context , the approximated wave functional will be substituted by a _ trial wave functional _ of the gaussian form according to the variational approach we shall use to evaluate @xmath129 . to compute such a quantity",
    "we will consider on @xmath130 deviations from the rn metric spatial section of the form , @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the spatial rn background .",
