    "the bosonic d - brane has an unstable tachyonic mode on the perturbative vacuum .",
    "it has been conjectured @xcite that there is a local minimum of the tachyon potential ( non - perturbative vacuum ) , where the tension of the d - brane and the negative contribution from the tachyon potential exactly cancel each other . on this vacuum , there should be no d - branes and hence no open string excitations at all , leaving only the closed string sector .",
    "it has been also conjectured that the solutions on this non - perturbative vacuum represent various lower dimensional d - branes ( descent relations ) .    for studying these conjectures , string field theories",
    "have proved to be very useful , and there have appeared many interesting works in this direction @xcite@xcite . in particular , witten s cubic open string field theory ( csft ) @xcite combined with the level truncation approximation @xcite has been successful in verifying the conjecture on the potential height to a very high degree of accuracy @xcite . though most of these conjectures , the potential height problem and the descent relation , have later been proved @xcite in another formulation of open string field theory called boundary string field theory ( bsft ) @xcite , there still remains an important problem to be understood : how the open string excitations disappear around the non - perturbative vacuum .",
    "note that for analyzing this problem we have to treat all the modes in open string theory other than the tachyon mode .",
    "therefore , csft whose action is given in a closed form seems to be rather suited for this problem than bsft which has concise expression only for the tachyon field .",
    "one of possible ways to prove the absence of physical open string excitations is to show that they all have infinite masses @xcite .",
    "another and roughly an equivalent way is to show that the physical components of the open string field fluctuations lack their kinetic terms in the sft action and hence become non - dynamical @xcite ( kinetic term means the quadratic term of the fluctuations containing the derivatives with respect to the center - of - mass string coordinate ) . in relation to this , an interesting deformed version of csft has recently been proposed in @xcite as a possible sft model around the non - perturbative vacuum .",
    "the brst operator in this model is simply equal to the ghost zero - mode , @xmath0 , and hence the quadratic term @xmath1 contains no kinetic term at all .",
    "what we have to do for proving the absence of open string excitations on the non - perturbative vacuum is to derive this kind of sft from the ordinary csft .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore , using the level truncation approximation , the possibility that csft action expanded around the non - perturbative vacuum contains no kinetic terms for physical fluctuations .",
    "let the action of csft be given by @xmath2 , and let us expand the original string field @xmath3 as @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the classical solution representing the non - perturbative vacuum .",
    "then the term in @xmath6 quadratic in the fluctuation @xmath7 is @xmath8 .",
    "since the three - string interaction vertex defining the star - product @xmath9 contains any powers of the derivative @xmath10 with respect to the center - of - mass @xmath11 of the string coordinate @xmath12 , the kinetic term for the fluctuation @xmath7 consists of terms with any number of derivatives .",
    "our expectation is that these kinetic terms all vanish for the physical components of @xmath7 , where `` physical '' means being brst invariant .",
    "we are going to study this possibility in the level ( 2,6 ) truncation by taking as the fluctuations only the scalar modes at levels zero and two . as the kinetic terms we take the quadratic and the quartic ones in the derivatives @xmath10 .",
    "as the simplest and encouraging example , let us quote our result in the level @xmath13 approximation , namely , let us take only the level zero scalar field @xmath14 ( see sec .",
    "the kinetic term for @xmath14 quadratic in the derivative is @xmath15 \\left({\\partial}_\\mu t\\right)^2 , \\label{eq : skin}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the classical value of @xmath14 at the non - perturbative vacuum .",
    "this kinetic term vanishes at @xmath17 , which is close to the value of @xmath16 obtained as the stationary point of the level ( 0,0 ) potential , @xmath18 .",
    "even this simplest example supports our expectation that the kinetic term for the physical fluctuations totally vanish .    in our analysis in the level ( 2,6 ) approximation",
    ", we consider the kinetic terms quadratic and quartic in the derivatives for the three scalar fluctuation modes at levels zero and two .",
    "then the coefficients of the kinetic terms form @xmath19 matrices in the space of fluctuations .",
    "since there is only one physical component among the three scalar fluctuations , the two matrices , one for the kinetic term with two derivatives and the other with four , must have a common zero - mode ( namely , the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue zero ) in order for the physical fluctuation to disappear from the kinetic terms .",
    "we examine numerically whether this condition is satisfied in the neighborhood of the non - perturbative vacuum , and obtain results which support our expectation .",
    "the organization of the rest of this paper is as follows . in sec .  2 , after making a setup for the level truncation calculation in csft , we present the derivative expansion of the kinetic term of the action and the brst transformation at a generic translation invariant background .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "3 we carry out the numerical analysis of the kinetic terms and the brst transformations of the fluctuations to examine whether the kinetic terms for the physical fluctuation can disappear in the neighborhood of the non - perturbative vacuum . finally in sec .  4",
    ", we discuss future problems .",
    "in this section , as a preparation for the analysis in sec .  3 , we fix our conventions for the csft action , and then present the derivative expansion of the kinetic terms and the brst transformation for the scalar fluctuation modes in the level ( 2,6 ) approximation .",
    "we shall first recapitulate the gauge - fixed action and the brst transformation of csft in the siegel gauge .",
    "they are both obtained from the gauge invariant action : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the open string coupling constant , and @xmath22 denotes the integrations over the anti - ghost zero - mode @xmath23 and the center - of - mass coordinate @xmath11 of the @xmath24-th string .",

    "this action has an invariance under the brst transformation @xmath52 : @xmath53 physical quantities in the present sft are required to be invariant under the brst transformation .      as mentioned in sec .  1",
    ", we are interested in the kinetic term of the string field fluctuation around the non - perturbative vacuum . to analyze it in the simplest framework",
    ", we adopt the level ( 2,6 ) truncation and take the scalar fields at levels zero and two , both as the vacuum coordinates and the fluctuations .",
    "namely , we restrict the @xmath54 component field sector of @xmath28 to the following form : @xmath55 then , reexpressing the three component field @xmath56 as @xmath57 with @xmath58 being a ( translation invariant ) vacuum value and @xmath59 the fluctuation around @xmath58 , we carry out the derivative expansion of the kinetic term of the fluctuation @xmath59 obtained from the action @xmath6 ( [ eq : s ] ) : @xmath60    here we are making the simplification of considering only the scalar fields @xmath61 . in particular , we took only the trace part of the tensor fields @xmath62 which appear in the expansion of @xmath28 in the form @xmath63 .",
    "we have also discarded the vector field at level two which appear as the coefficient of @xmath64 .",

    "note that this curve passes the point @xmath223 , implying that @xmath222 holds near the non - perturbative vacuum .    however , the corresponding curve for @xmath214 is totally outside the region of our interest in the @xmath140 plane .",
    "therefore , we instead studied the behavior of @xmath214 as a function of @xmath14 for a number of fixed values of @xmath140 ( see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : testyzall ] we see that @xmath214 has a zero at a rather small @xmath14 when the @xmath140 coordinate is close to that of the non - perturbative vacuum .      in this section ,",

    "they are hoped to improve in a better treatment , in particular , by taking into account the mixing with the vector and tensor components at level two which we neglected in this paper .",
    "we have carried out the same analysis also in the level ( 2,4 ) approximation , and found that the results are not qualitatively changed .",
    "our analysis in this paper is incomplete in various aspects , and further detailed studies are needed for confirming the absence of kinetic terms .",
    "we have to extend the space of fluctuations to incorporate the vector and tensor components even in the level ( 2,6 ) approximation .",
    "this is indispensable for making clear the full brst structure of the fluctuations .",
    "we have to consider the kinetic terms with more than four derivatives .",
    "and we have to raise the order of the level truncation .",
    "what is more important is of course the analytical understanding of the absence of the kinetic terms , though this must be a difficult task since the exact solution @xmath5 for the non - perturbative vacuum  would be needed .",
    "conversely , the missing kinetic terms for the fluctuations could give a hint for finding the exact solution .",
    "it is also an interesting question whether the csft expanded around the non - perturbative vacuum  is a topological theory described by a brst exact action @xcite .",
