    "electrostatic interaction in aqueous solutions including charged interfaces is of interest in a wide range of areas such as biological macromolecules , colloidal suspensions and nanoparticle assembly .",
    "the structure of screened ions near charged surfaces , so - called the electric double layer , controls many macroscopic properties of the system such as the zeta potential and colloidal renormalized charges @xcite , and is affected by the interfacial chemistry , the surface charge distribution , the ionic specificity , and so on . in the presence of divalent ions , electrostatic correlation plays a very important role , which could lead to the overscreening of counterions near highly charged surfaces , i.e. , the charge inversion phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the electrostatic correlation is probably responsible for a lot of many - body phenomena such as like - charge attraction @xcite and ion crowding in membrane channels @xcite , and many - body systems such as electrodes in ionic liquids @xcite .",
    "the correct understanding of correlation effects and their relation with interfacial properties are then considered to be of significant in many applications .",
    "electrostatic correlation should be seriously studied in many conditions , e.g. , if a system includes highly charged surfaces , multivalent counterions , or if the system is at low temperature .",
    "the correlation strength is often measured by a coupling parameter @xcite defined as @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the counterion valence , the average surface charge density , the electronic charge , the dielectric permittivity , and the thermal energy , respectively .",
    "the coupling parameter can be simplified to @xmath6 , the product of @xmath7 and the ratio of the bjerrum length @xmath8 to the gouy - chapman length @xmath9 .",
    "these two length scales describe the ion - ion and ion - interface interaction strengths , respectively .",
    "the classical poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory is often used , but it is mean - field and works only when @xmath10 since it ignores the ion correlation , thus fails to capture correlation - induced electrostatic phenomena .",
    "many extended theories beyond the mean field have been proposed and applied for different problems , e.g. , to include the steric effect or dielectric self energy @xcite .",
    "a first - principle description of electrostatic correlation should follow the integral - equation theory @xcite , which turns out to be a difficulty in resolving high - dimensional obstacles .",
    "phenomenologically , the electrostatic correlation is taken into account in a ginzburg - laudau - type functional which yields a modified pb equation with a biharmonic term to describe the contribution from the correlation energy @xcite and a correlation length as a parameter to be accurately fitted by simulations or experiments .    in most of theoretical and computational studies under the primitive model @xcite , a homogeneous dielectric profile for electrolytes near surfaces",
    "is often assumed , e.g. , 80 for the relative dielectric constant of water solvent .",
    "this is far from a high - accurate description of the solvent .",
    "water molecules are ordered near micro- or macro- ions , weakening the shielding for ion - ion interactions .",
    "this has led to models for ion - concentration- or field - dependent dielectric permittivities .",
    "historically , the dependence of the dielectric permittivity on the ionic solution has been discussed as early as 1940s @xcite .",
    "later , booth considered the dielectric constant of polar electrolytes as a function of the electrostatic field strength @xcite , which was followed by many related studies from molecular dynamics simulations @xcite to continuum theory @xcite .",
    "recent work also reported that the dielectric decrement is relevant to ion - specific effects @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the booth s model was utilized to modify the poisson - boltzmann equation to predict the capacitance with effects of morphology and dielectric permittivity @xcite .",
    "coupled with the booth s model , the langevin - poisson - boltzmann ( lpb ) equation was developed to investigate the effects of polarization saturation to the contact potential at the colloid surface and the long - range interaction between colloids @xcite .",
    "more recently , bonthuis",
    "_ et al_. @xcite and bonthuis and netz @xcite through molecular dynamics simulations showed that the interfacial dielectric function is closely related to the molecular solvent structure of the surface . by incorporating the structure properties in the dielectric profile ,",
    "the bonthuis - netz model @xcite has been successful in predicting the ion distribution with good agreement to a bunch of physical experimental results and particle simulations .    when moving an ion from a high - dielectric region to a lower one , it costs the solvation energy and thus favors to stay away .",
    "this explains the ion depletion near the water / air interface @xcite .",
    "so with the decrement of the double - layer dielectric permittivity by the field , ions are repelled .",
    "in contrast , we should see that the ion - ion correlation becomes stronger for lower @xmath4 since the coupling parameter @xmath11 is proportional to @xmath12 , favorable for the ion congregation .",
    "these mutual effects to the interfacial ion structure are less understood .",
    "this is our purpose to find an appropriate model to account for both effects .",
    "we considered the effect of inhomogeneous dielectric function , which is either space - dependent or field - dependent under the continuum theory .",
    "we go one step further to couple the dielectric function with the self - consistent field ( scf ) theory @xcite to incorporate the correlation energy ( the self energy of a test ion ) . a self - consistent system composed of a self - energy modified pb equation ( or possion - nernst - planck equation for charge dynamics ) and a generalized debye - hckel ( dh ) equation is derived , which can characterize the inhomogeneous dielectric background .",
    "this scf model gives rise to many difficult issues for numerical approximation .",
    "on one hand , the inhomogeneity of dielectric permittivity introduces the difference in the solvation energy ( born energy ) , which is inversely proportional to the product of the dielectric constant and the ionic radius @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to handle the exclude - volume effect of ions , essentially giving rise to a multi - scale problem , which was discussed by wang @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the solution of the generalized dh equation is always a difficult issue even when the dielectric profile is homogeneous , since it is a green s function equation .",
    "numerical methods for this high - dimensional problem are computationally expensive .",
    "more efficient numerical methods should be proposed .",
    "these technical issues will be resolved by introducing an asymptotic decomposition of the self energy , where the approximate dh equation is represented by an integral over the three - dimensional domain .",
    "the traditional scf equations for charged systems are based on a point - charge assumption , formulated from the variational field theory .",
    "the solution of this set of equations blows up at a high coupling parameter @xmath11 because the ionic size effect is ignored and thus the correlation energy is divergent @xcite .",
    "this shortcoming is fixed in this paper , thus allowing us to explore new physics at the higher coupling regime .",
    "we simulate 1:1 and 2:1 salts for electrolytes through the proposed scf model and particle - based monte carlo simulations , and find excellent agreement between two approaches .",
    "meanwhile , it is illustrated that many important features are captured by the modified scf equations , e.g. , the depletion due to the low dielectric zone and the charge inversion for strong - coupling systems .",
    "furthermore , we find from the booth dielectric model that the electric field causes the ordered water alignment only for the first few layers , which however greatly changes the surface potential of the charged interface .",
    "these results demonstrate attractive features of the modified scf model , and then promising for the use in understanding more physical and biological phenomena .",
    "let @xmath4 be the dielectric permittivity of the solvent with a binary salt of valences @xmath13 .",
    "subject to suitable boundary conditions , the electrostatic potential @xmath14 in the electrolyte is described by the classical poisson equation , @xmath15 where @xmath3 is the elementary charge and @xmath16 is the concentration function of the ions of species @xmath17 . by the mass conservation",
    ", the modified nernst - planck equation is used to describe the dynamics of charged particles in an electrolyte , i.e. , the equation for @xmath16 is , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the diffusion constant , and @xmath20 is the inverse thermal energy . the first term in the right side of eq .",
    "describes the diffusion of ions , and the second term is the contribution from the ion convection due to the energy gradient and @xmath21 is the electrostatic energy of an ion at the position , called the potential of mean force as approximated by the sum of the mean potential energy and the correlation energy @xmath22 , following a lot of work @xcite .",
    "the physical meaning of the potential of mean force is the free energy cost of moving a test ion from the bulk solvent region into its current position , where the correlation energy is related to a green s function to be discussed later on . in equilibrium ,",
    "the nernst - planck equation eq . has an explicit formula for ionic concentration , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the concentration in bulk solution .",
    "this leads to the self - energy modified pb equation , @xmath25 this equation is beyond the classical pb theory in the sense that electrostatic correlations have been included in the self energy to improve the approximation of the mean - force potential .",
    "equation is available for cases with symmetric or asymmetric ionic sizes and valences . for physical systems with high surface charge densities or large surface electric potentials , since the ion density near the interface increases exponentially and does not saturate .",
    "we introduce a local treatment by using the entropic contribution of water molecules in the free energy and use the lattice gas formalism to derive the ion density distribution with maximal charge density constraints @xcite , though the influence of this treatment is debated in @xcite . in this case , the equilibrium ion concentration with steric entropic effect of each particle in the solvent is given by , @xmath26 with @xmath27,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the lattice volume of an ion . at the dilute limit or at the bulk solvent",
    "@xmath29 decays to zero .",
    "we then modify eq . into ,",
    "@xmath30 it should be noted that the use of asymmetric lattice volumes is also possible though the relation between the ion concentration and the electric energy has to be in a form of a transcendental equation @xcite , which has the exact explicit solution only for the same size .",
    "we should remark that the ionic steric effect is essentially short - range correlation effect and nonlocal @xcite .",
    "this should be modified by , e.g. , the modified fundamental measure theory @xcite , when this steric effect has to treated more accurately .    in order to close the above equation system , we define the self energy @xmath31 by following the scf theory @xcite , where it is defined as the self - green s function limit , @xmath32 , \\label{ugfs}\\ ] ] and @xmath33 is the green s function described by a generalized debye - hckel ( dh ) equation , and @xmath34 is the free - space green s function described by @xmath35 . in order to take into account the effect of variable dielectric permittivity , the dh equation in the scf theory is expressed as @xcite , @xmath36 where the dielectric permittivity @xmath37 and ionic strength @xmath38 locally depend on the position of the test ion of species @xmath17 , which characterizes its ionic size effects to the dielectric function and excluded volume , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the effective dielectric permittivity inside the ion and is thought to be related with the ionic specificity , e.g. , ionic polarizability .",
    "the ions can also be treated as conducting spheres with adjustable hydrated radius .",
    "this treatment has been shown to perform well in matching the simulation and experimental results and explaining the hofmeister effect for ions near dielectric interfaces @xcite .",
    "however , we will not investigate polarizable effects in this work and assume a constant interior dielectric constant @xmath41 .",
    "at the point charge assumption @xmath42 , eq . is divergent for a space - dependent @xmath4 , thus this modification is essential to ensure a finite self energy @xmath31 .",
    "it can be emphasized that ionic specific effects can be accounted for by defining a species - dependent @xmath43 in eq . .",
    "the large potentials usually appear near the surfaces with strong surface charges , the treatment with steric entropy is useful to control numerical stability and performs well to constrain the concentration of counterions in a physically significant regime . for the case of asymmetric ionic sizes ,",
    "we take the lattice volume @xmath28 as the volume of a counterion , considering the ion distribution is far below the saturation density and not sensitive to the size of the coions . on the other hand",
    ", we do introduce the effect of asymmetry in ion size when calculating the self energy with eq . .",
    "we find this consideration is necessary when the ion - ion correlation between coions is also strong , e.g. , for 2:2 electrolytes .",
    "let @xmath44 be a length scale to characterize the geometric length of interfaces , @xmath45 be the bjerrum length in water solvent , and @xmath46 be the debye screening length .",
    "following dimensionless parameters and variables in @xcite , we define @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "we define the dimensionless variables for the surface charge density @xmath53 and the dipole moment @xmath54 for the use in next sections .",

    "we shall note that after the nondimensionalization the dielectric permittivities @xmath60 and @xmath61 since they are divided by the water dielectric constant .",
    "it is not difficult to see that @xmath62 denotes the effective dielectric function , and @xmath63 represents the effective charge of the test ion and hence the strength of its self energy .",

    "this system of self - consistent equations is general for different electrolytes and arbitrary surface geometries .",
    "the solution of the dh equation is challenging , not only because of its high dimensions but also because it is a multiscale problem , i.e. , the sizes of nanoparticles and mobile ions are of two different spatial scales .",
    "to approximate @xmath31 , we denote an inverse debye length function by @xmath64 , and set @xmath65 without loss of generality , then the dh equation is written as , @xmath66 where similar to @xmath67 defined by eq . , @xmath68 is six dimensional and locally depend on the location of the test ion , @xmath69 we recall the dimensionless @xmath4 is unitary in the bulk solvent region .    to resolve the multiscale problem in the approximation of the self energy ,",
    "we decompose the solution for @xmath31 into two parts by @xmath70 such that @xmath71 satisfies , @xmath72 where @xmath73 we shall see that @xmath74 is piecewise constant , which is uniform outside the ionic cavity .",

    "@xmath42 , the self green s function @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 . here ,",
    "@xmath84 and @xmath85 do not depend on the site of the test ion , and we then remove the difficulty of solving two space scales .",

    "let @xmath88 since @xmath84 and @xmath85 are both smooth functions , we transform the green s function equation into the equation for @xmath89 , @xmath90 where , after using the property @xmath91 for any smooth @xmath92 , we can write , @xmath93^{1/2}.\\ ] ] for the free - space green s function , we introduce @xmath94 . subtracting eq . and @xmath95 into eq",

    "each step includes a multiplication of two dense matrices , which is too expensive to implement .",
    "however , @xmath102 is actually pretty good asymptotic approximation to the green s function , and we could expect that @xmath103 may include enough information to understand the green s function . at this point , the expression for @xmath104 is , @xmath105 \\nonumber \\\\ & & = -\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{r})}\\int \\frac{v^2(\\mathbf{r}'')\\mathcal{h}^{(1)}(\\mathbf{r}'',\\mathbf{r})}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}''| } d\\mathbf{r } '' . \\label{tildeu1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , we find an approximate solution for the self energy , @xmath106,~i=\\pm , \\label{eq : uasym}\\ ] ] where @xmath104 is tge integral expression .",
    "the global dielectric and ionic strength variations due to dielectric interfaces are included in @xmath107 . for general @xmath63 , eq .",
    "multiplied by @xmath63 is the self energy of the ion .    for weak coupling cases , e.g. , dilute electrolytes with monovalent ions , the born energy ( the second term in eq . ) dominates the self energy .",
    "this term is a local property which only depends on the local dielectric constant and ionic radius .",
    "this energy has been incorporated into the classical mean - field pb theory by paunov _",
    "this modified pb theory captures some important effects due to inhomgeneous dielectric media in dilute electrolytes .",
    "the modified equation can be solved simply by the iterative numerical methods . however , for strong coupling cases as discussed in the present work , the nonlocal correlation effect ( the first term in eq . ) is of great importance and non - ignorable .",
    "as is shown , the correlation energy corresponds to the solution of the self green s function . in order to approximate",
    "the sophisticated procedure of solving the generalized dh equation , we make use of the concept of born series and arrive at the integral formula as , which corresponds to a matrix - vector multiplication in discretization form , and thus is achievable in practical use .",
    "it should be remarked that the convergence of the born series depends on the smoothness of the dielectric permittivity .",
    "the accuracy may be low when a large gradient is present in the dielectric profile .",
    "when the interface is regular such as planes or spheres , this can be tackled by taking the integral region as the solvent region and introducing a wkb - type approximation by using the image charge method ; see @xcite for planar interfaces . for a general geometry ,",
    "an efficient approximation remains an open question .      in this section ,",
    "we introduce the dipolar model for the dielectric permittivity .",
    "the solvent molecules of the solution generally contain permanent dipoles .",
    "when an external electric field is applied , the dipoles are oriented against the field and the solvent is polarized .",
    "as aforementioned in the introduction , the dependence of polarization and dielectric permittivity on the electric field strength was systematically discussed by booth @xcite in the 1950s . in the dimensional form",
    ", the booth s relation is expressed by the formula , @xmath108 with the field strength @xmath109 , the langevin function @xmath110 and the dipole density @xmath111 , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the permanent dipole moment of a solvent molecule and its number density .",
    "considering the case of water solvent , we have the limit in bulk electrolytes @xmath114 , which gives @xmath115 . in eq .",
    ", we have neglected the finite size effect of solvent molecules by assuming them as point dipoles .",
    "this field - dependent dielectric effect was involved into the classical pb model by paunov _",
    "_ @xcite and was named later as dipolar pb ( dpb ) equation by abrashkin _",
    "_ @xcite . usually , it is reasonable to neglect the small change in the dipolar density for water solvent , i.e. , assume @xmath116 , which yields the langevin pb equation @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this neglect repairs the divergence of the dipole density , and thus the langevin equation gives more reasonable prediction for the dielectric function than the diploar model @xcite .",
    "we then follow the simplified version for ignoring the density fluctuation of water , and include the self - energy contribution due to the dielectric inhomogeneity and the electrostatic correlation . in dimensionless form ,",
    "the langevin - scf equation ( scf - l ) reads , @xmath117 where @xmath21 and @xmath29 are expressions described in eqs . and and @xmath118 we have @xmath119 and @xmath120 .    besides the above field - dependent or booth s model for dielectric permittivity , there have been many discussions for other effects to local variations of the dielectric permittivity . with the simple dipole moment model , one can see that ions in electrolytes undergo solvation shells and prevent the surrounding water molecules from being oriented against the external field .",
    "the dielectric permittivity of the solution will be decreased when ions are added to it , and one can obtain equations for the salt - concentration - dependent dielectric permittivity for electrolytes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the ionic polarization also plays a role in the dielectric function because ions act as induced dipole moments in an external field @xcite .",
    "when these effects are considered , the potential of mean force @xmath21 in the scf model has to be modified again .",
    "however , we will limit the discussion to eq . and save them as future work if these effects have to be included to describe unexplored physics .",
    "now we consider a special case of a charged nanoparticle with radius @xmath121 surrounded by an electrolyte ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : schem ] ) .",
    "the surface charge is distributed uniformly on the surface with density @xmath2 to make the potential field spherically symmetric .",

    "we have the neumann boundary condition for electric potential on the surface @xmath123 note here we have used the dimensionless surface charge density and @xmath58 , and the dielectric permittivity is also dimensionless which is relative to the water dielectric permittivity . the origin of the sphere is set to be @xmath124 in the spherical coordinates . clearly , we have the fact that the @xmath17th ion can not penetrate the region @xmath125 due to the hard - wall repulsion to mobile ions",
