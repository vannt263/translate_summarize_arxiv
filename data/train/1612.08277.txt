    "the magnitude of the drag force exerted on a colloidal particle moving slowly enough in a fluid is proportional to its speed .",

    "most well - known is the drag coefficient of a rigid sphere in a three dimensional ( 3d ) fluid @xcite .",

    "the latter tends to the former as the ratio of the viscosity of the droplet to that of the ambient fluid approaches infinity .",

    "the drag coefficient of a disk in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) fluid can not be calculated in the stokes approximation @xcite .",
    "this stokes paradox can be helped when the fluid is sandwiched by 3d fluids .",
    "this situation , for example , is realized by using a lipid - bilayer membrane , which is the main part of biomembrane and has the fluidity @xcite . the drag coefficient was calculated for a small disk in a flat fluid membrane surrounded by 3d fluids occupying semi - infinite spaces on both sides @xcite ; the result was utilized experimentally ( @xcite ) .",

    "raft - like liquid domains in an artificial fluid membrane have also been studied in the context of phase separation @xcite .",

    ", we introduce a dimensionless parameter defined as @xmath2 in @xcite , @xmath3 is supposed to vanish .",
    "cases where the membrane viscosities are slightly different were studied in @xcite , where the drag coefficient is calculated up to a linear order of @xmath3 .",
    "however , as described later , one boundary condition is overlooked there .",
    "this error is corrected and the drag coefficient is recalculated up to the same order in @xcite . in the present study , using the corrected boundary condition , we calculate the drag coefficient of a liquid domain by considering terms of higher order with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , as @xmath3 approaches unity , _",
