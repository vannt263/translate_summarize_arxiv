    "the problem of time ( pot ) @xcite is a multi - faceted conceptual incompatibility between various areas of theoretical physics . whilst usually stated as between gr and qm ,",
    "in fact 8/9ths of it is already present at the classical level @xcite .",
    "i adopt a ` top down ' classical and then quantum approach .",
    "moreover , we arrive there by considering the conceptually and philosophically interesting case of background - independent physical theories @xcite , which have the pot as a consequence .",
    "the quantum version of the pot is more severe , the almost - complete classical manifestation of the problem is expected to be a useful precursor as regards the form , and resolution , of the quantum version of the problem .",
    "we begin with the temporal relationalism facet of the pot .",
    "temporal relationalism is the root of the well - known quantum - level frozen formalism problem of the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation @xcite .",

    "\\1 ) temporal relationalism can be mathematically implemented by manifest reparametrization invariance , manifest    parametrization irrelevance , or geometrical actions that happen to be dual to the latter @xcite .",
    "\\2 ) temporal relationalism leads directly to the hamiltonian constraint @xmath2 .",
    "thus it leads to the frozen formalism problem manifesting wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation @xmath3 at the quantum level .",
    "[ this is to be contrasted with the time - dependent schrdinger equation and other time - dependent quantum wave equations . ]",
    "\\3 ) the primarily timeless situation is resolved at the classical level along the lines of mach s time principle  time is to be abstracted from change @xmath4 ( for configurations @xmath5 which form the configuration space @xmath6 ) .",
    "this is in a manner that extends the concept of the astronomers ephemeris time @xcite .",
    "sec 3 then considers configurational relationalism : a group @xmath7 of physically irrelevant transformations acting upon @xmath6 .",
    "this is to be implemented by corrections to the changes ( deparametrized velocities ) .",
    "one then extremizes the action with respect to the @xmath7 auxiliaries ( known as ` best matching ' @xcite , which is a type of reduction ) .",
    "moreover , the output of this extremization features in the expression for @xmath8 for theories with nontrivial @xmath7 .",
    "minisuperspace does not manifest nontrivial configurational relationalism @xcite , but relational particle mechanics ( rpm ) does @xcite , as follows .",
    "its action is s = 2 , w : = e - v ( ) , t : = m_iijj_a , bq^ii_a , bq^jj/2 , _ , ^i : = - - ^i , here @xmath9 is the ` potential factor ' , with constituent parts @xmath10 the potential energy and @xmath11 the total energy .",
    "@xmath12 is the kinetic term , built out of the kinetic metric ( alias in this case mass matrix ) @xmath13 and the best - matching derivative @xmath14 with respect to the translational auxiliary @xmath15 and the rotational auxiliary @xmath16 .",
    "underlining denotes spatial vector ( also lower - case latin indices , whereas upper - case ones denote particle labels ) , and bold font denotes configuration space quantity ( here possessing both of these types of indices ) .",
    "then varying with respect to @xmath15 gives the zero total momentum constraint @xmath17 , and with respect to @xmath16 gives the zero total angular momentum constraint @xmath18 .",
    "best matching then involves solving the velocity formulation of these constraints for the extremal values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 themselves . in 2-@xmath19",
    "these can be entirely solved for @xcite ( in 3-@xmath19 they can be solved for _ locally _ , meaning away from the physically bona fide collinear configurations for which , nonetheless , the configuration space geometry becomes singular ) .    for full gr ,",

    "best matching here then involves solving the so - called thin sandwich problem @xcite : solving the linear momentum constraint for the gr shift with spatial metric @xmath21 and its label - time velocity @xmath22 as data on a spatial hypersurface @xmath20 . the thin sandwich [ fig 1.b ) ]",
    "is the infinitesimal limit of the thick sandwich [ fig 1.a ) ] , and features as a second facet of the pot @xcite .",
    "fig 1.c ) recasts this in best matching form , which is more general over the set of theories [ e.g. fig 1.d ) exhibits the corresponding best matching for the rpm triangle ] .",
    "this thin sandwich problem is in general a major unsolved problem @xcite ; however , the current article , demonstrates that it is surmountable for the practically relevant subcase of gr that is slightly inhomogeneous cosmology .",
    "since slightly inhomogeneous quantum cosmology is a case of considerable interest ( see below ) , this adds substantial value to quantum gravity schemes @xcite that require thin sandwich resolution at an early stage .",
    "note that the above lagrange multiplier implementation of configurational relationalism ( rooted in conventional principles of dynamics practise ) spoils temporal relationalism .",
    "this is resolved by a more careful choice of configurational relationalism s auxiliaries",
    "@xcite , as per sec 3 .",
    "take this as a first indication that attempted resolutions of individual pot facets have a great tendency to interfere with each other @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a full modification of the principles of dynamics to be compatible with temporal relationalism .",

    "this article s model ",
    "slightly inhomogeneous cosmology  combines temporal features of minisuperspace and rpm into one arena , and with the added benefit of being more cosmologically realistic than either model .",
    "we set this model up in secs 4 ( configurations ) , 5 ( the model s @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) and 6 ( the model s relational action ) .",
    "slightly inhomogeneous cosmology is a perturbative treatment about some minisuperspace .",
    "in particular , this article considers a second - order perturbation treatment about the spatially isotropic @xmath0 model with a single minimally - coupled scalar field .",
    "this shares many features with halliwell and hawking s @xcite model ; differences from this due to relationalism being followed in this article are laid out in secs 2 to 6 .",
    "i choose this model for the following reasons .",
    "\\1 ) closed models are machian , @xmath23 is the simplest case , and the most conventional for closed - universe cosmologies .",
    "\\2 ) one needs at least 2 degrees of freedom for a relational formulation of a physical system , for the relational minimum is that one physical quantity evolves in terms of another .",
    "\\3 ) cosmology conventionally makes use of scalar fields .",
    "the simplest case is one scalar field .",
    "it is not hard to extend to n scalar fields as regards this article s considerations .",
    "a cosmological constant term is needed @xcite to support the closed spatially-@xmath0 homogeneous isotropic friedmann ",
    "walker ( flrw ) cosmology with scalar field matter in the case with matter effects are presumed small .",
    "slightly inhomogeneous cosmology matters foremost due to how the inhomogeneous fluctuations that underlie structure formation @xcite  galaxies and cmb hotspots  might have been seeded by quantum cosmological fluctuations , as magnified by some inflationary mechanism @xcite .",
    "moreover , this particularly practically relevant setting suffices to manifests all facets of the problem of time ( pot ) .",
    "the constraints underlying many of these facets are provided in sec 7 for the above model , with the indirect formulation of its machian classical emergent time in sec 8 , and the sandwich equation and its aforementioned successful solution in sec 9 .",
    "i next name the remaining pot facets ; see the section ascribed to each for the facet s meaning plus the specific example of that facet in slightly inhomogeneous cosmology .",
    "constraint closure @xcite ( sec 10 ) , expression in terms of beables @xcite ( sec 11 ) , spacetime relationalism ( sec 12 ) , foliation independence ( sec 13 ) @xcite and spacetime construction @xcite ( sec 14 ) .",
    "minisuperspace is trivial as regards the configurational relationalism , constraint closure , foliation dependence and spacetime construction facets of the pot . on the other hand , rpm is trivial for the spacetime relationalism and construction and foliation dependence facets .",
    "slightly inhomogeneous cosmology , however , is motivated by having all nine facets non - trivial [ i demonstrate the eight of them that occur at the classical level in this article . ]",
    "thus this model arena serves as the successor of both of minisuperspace and rpm s qualitative insights into the pot .",
    "further successes in resolving this model include : understanding the degrees of freedom count and constraint algebra , and providing a ` basis set ' of beables for this model .",
    "( in contrast with observables being quantities that _ are observed _ , beables are quantities that just _ are_. this is more appropriate for whichever of cosmology or closed - system qm @xcite . )",
    "sec 15 conciudes with this work s frontiers , including an outline of these results quantum counterparts .",

    "i.e. the action in question is to be _ manifestly reparametrization - invariant_.    via its use of a label time @xmath25 , this is a relatively conventional presentation . then for instance",
    "a primary notion of velocity can defined as the derivative with respect to @xmath25 :    : = / ( ) q^/ .",
    "next , one can straightforwardly build the kinetic term @xmath26 .",

    "i.e. making no use of @xmath25 .",
    "consequently , there is no primary notion of velocity , kinetic energy , lagrangian , and more @xcite .",
    "velocities have been supplanted at the primary level by differentials ( ` changes in configuration ' ) : q^ .",

    "this article supplies some of those , and in doing so delineates how refoliation invariance and spacetime construction nontriviality require the plain ( rather than modewise ) analysis .",
    "these two differ because mode expansions are of the spheres of homogeneity themselves .",
    "thus , whereas one can refoliate flrw spacetime in whatever other manner ( paralleling dirac s insight for minkowski spacetime treated thus @xcite ) , one can not expect the modewise split to carry over to other foliations .",
    "hence use of the modewise split amounts to an extra use of privileged structure .    in the slightly inhomogeneous cosmology arena , at the classical level",
    "the modewise approach leads to a timefunction that bears small corrections relative to the usual concept of cosmic time .",
