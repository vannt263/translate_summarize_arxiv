    "besides being of fundamental interest , ionic systems including electrolyte solutions , molten salts and ionic liquids deserve great attention from practical point of view . for example , new ionic liquids with very low vapor pressure may find applications in environmentally clean industry . over the last ten years",
    "the phase and critical behavior of ionic fluids has been a subject of intense research . for reviews of experimental and theoretical situation",
    "see refs . @xcite and the references cited therein .",
    "basic properties of ionic systems can be described by the primitive model ( pm ) consisting of a mixture of @xmath3 species of charged hard spheres . a two - component mixture of positive @xmath4 and negative @xmath5 charges having all the same diameter @xmath6 is a simple charge - asymmetric pm ( spm ) . in the case",
    "@xmath7 we have a well - known restricted primitive model ( rpm ) .",
    "early studies @xcite established that the rpm has a gas - liquid ( gl)-like critical point . a reasonable theoretical description of the gl critical point of the rpm was accomplished at a mean - field ( mf ) level using integral equation methods @xcite and debye - hckel ( dh ) theory @xcite . over the last decade",
    "numerous simulation studies have been devoted to the location of gl phase transition of this model @xcite and the most reliable current estimations turn out to be near @xmath8 , @xmath9 when the temperature @xmath10 and the density @xmath11 are in standard dimensionless units . due to controversial experimental findings , the critical behavior of the rpm has also been under active debates @xcite and strong evidence for an ising universal class has been found by recent simulations @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies .    in spite of significant progress in this field ,",
    "ionic systems are far from being completely understood .",
    "the investigation of more complex models is very important in understanding the nature of critical and phase behavior of real ionic fluids which demonstrate both the charge and size asymmetry as well as other complexities such as short - range attraction .",
    "the studies of the effects of charge - asymmetry on the phase diagram have been recently started using both the computer simulations @xcite and theoretical methods @xcite .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations show that spm exhibits a gl - like phase transition , specifically @xmath12 decreases with the increase of @xmath2 while @xmath13 rapidly increases .",
    "unfortunately , the results obtained within the framework of both the original dh theory and the mean spherical approximation ( msa ) are independent of @xmath2 .",
    "the results for the @xmath2-dependence of the critical temperature , obtained within the framework of the field - theoretical analysis @xcite contradict the simulations displaying the increase of temperature with @xmath2 . on the other hand , the recent results found based on the dh theory incorporated bjerrrum ion pairs and their solvation in the residual ionic fluid @xcite ( theories dhbjci and dhbjcihc ) demonstrate the decrease of @xmath14 with charge asymmetry for @xmath15 which agrees with mc data .",
    "this implies `` ... that recognizing ionic association is inescapable for a successful theory '' @xcite .",
    "the motivation of this paper is to check the above statement by means of the theory that exploites the method of collective variables ( cvs ) @xcite .",
    "our aim is to answer the question : is the theory , which does not include the effects of association explicitely in the hamiltonian , capable of correctly describing , at least on the qualitative level , the gl - like phase diagram of spm ? to this end , we develop a theoretical approach which is based on the functional representation of configurational boltzmann factor in terms of cvs . for a general case of a two - component model which includes both the short- and long - range interactions we derive an exact expression for the functional integral of the grand partition function ( gpf ) . the cv action obtained depends upon the two sets of cvs : @xmath16 ( and conjugate @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 ( and conjugate @xmath19 ) describing the total number density and charge density fluctuations , respectively .",
    "we start with the saddle point ( or mf ) solutions @xmath20 ( and @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 ( and @xmath23 ) , and then we expand the cv action functionally around the mf solutions . as a result , we obtain an infinite expansion in terms of cvs @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( or @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) . for spm , based on the gpf in the gaussian approximation , we propose a method for the calculation of chemical potential conjugate to the total number density .",
    "the method allows us to take into account the higher order fluctuation effects and consists in solving the equations for chemical potentials by means of successive approximations that correspond to the contributions of the higher - order correlations .",
    "its initial idea to some extent resembles the idea sketched out by hubbard in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the cvs were first introduced in the 1950s @xcite and then on their basis the so - called cvs method was developed @xcite . nearly at that time , other functional approaches based on the stratonovich - hubbard transformation @xcite were originated . as was shown",
    "recently @xcite both groups of theories are in close relation .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section  2 , starting from the hamiltonian of an asymmetric two - component model with long- and short - range interactions , we derive the exact functional representation of the gpf .",
    "we obtain an explicit expression for free energy of spm in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) that leads to the well - known results , i.e. the dh limiting law ( dhll ) for the point charge particles and the free energy in the optimized random phase approximation ( orpa ) ( or msa ) for spm . in section  3",
    "we study the gl critical point of spm taking into account the correlation effects of higher order .",
    "the results obtained demonstrate qualitative agreement with the mc simulation data for both the critical temperature and the critical density .",
    "we conclude in section  4 .",

    "in this paper we have studied the gl phase behaviour of a charge asymmetric primitive ionic model . for this purpose",
    "we have derived the exact expression for the functional of gpf of a two - component asymmetric ionic model which includes both the short- and long - range interactions among charged hard spheres .",
    "we have shown that the well - known approximations for the free energy , in particular dhll and orpa , can be reproduced within the framework of this approach .",
    "on the other hand , the gpf functional can be reduced to the form found in the ksshe theory @xcite .",
    "this means that the field - theoretical analysis of the expression for gpf given by ( [ 2.5])-([2.5a ] ) has to lead in the two - loop approximation to the same @xmath2-dependence for the critical temperatures as in @xcite which does not agree with the mc simulations . here",
    ", we have proposed an alternative method for the study of the gl phase equilibria in spm .",
    "it consists in the calculation of the chemical potential @xmath182 conjugate to the total number density by means of successive approximations .    in conclusion",
    ", we have obtained the expression for the chemical potential @xmath182 in which the effects of indirect correlations between the number density fluctuations are taken into consideration via a charge subsystem .",
    "based on this expression supplemented with the maxwell constraction the coexistence curves for @xmath1 have been calculated .",
    "the @xmath2-dependences obtained for both the critical temperature and the critical density qualitatively agree with mc simulations .",
    "the results demonstrate that the terms responsible for the charged clustering need not be included into the hamiltonian explicitely in order to describe , at least qualitatively , the gl phase diagram of spm . instead",
    ", the interaction between charge and density fluctuations should be properly taken into account . to achieve a quantitative agreement ,",
    "the higher order terms should be taken into consideration in the cv action .",
    "this task will be considered elsewhere .",
