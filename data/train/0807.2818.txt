    "young and massive stars have been found within one parsec from the galactic center ( gc ) @xcite .",
    "some of them are @xmath11000 au from the central smbh . how these massive stars were brought to the vicinity of the smbh",
    "has been a mystery .",
    "one possible scenario is the following . a star cluster formed at a few tens of pc from the gc , and then spiraled in due to the dynamical friction @xcite .",
    "previous simulations @xcite have shown that the timescale of spiral - in of the star cluster can be short enough",
    ". however , how close the stars can actually approach the smbh is not clear .",
    "another possible scenario is the in - situ formation in an accretion disk @xcite .",
    "giant molecular clouds fall into the gc and form massive gaseous disks around the central bh .",
    "stars form in the disk if it becomes gravitationally unstable and results in fragmentation",
    ". however , accretion disks have difficulty producing stars with eccentric orbits and a compact assembly of stars like irs 13e , which is located at @xmath2 pc in projection from the gc and contains half a dozen young stars and probably an imbh @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that if a gas cloud undergoes a very close encounter ( pericenter distance of 0.01 pc ) with the central smbh , the tidal compression could trigger the star formation , resulting in stars in close , bound orbits .",
    "however , how a cloud can come that close to the gc is not clear . on the other hand ,",
    "if the star cluster has an eccentric orbit , the orbits of stars escaped from the cluster are also eccentric . the remnant of the core looks like irs 13e .",
    "we performed a fully self - consistent @xmath0-body simulation in which the internal dynamics of the cluster , that of the parent galaxy , and interactions between cluster stars and galaxy stars are correctly handled . in previous simulations , when the internal dynamics was followed by an accurate @xmath0-body code , the parent galaxy had to be modeled as a fixed potential with some fitting formulae for the dynamical friction .",
    "this means that the orbital evolution is not accurate .",
    "@xcite showed that the actual orbital decay of the cluster is faster than that of previous simulations and the main reason is stars with a mass grater than 90% of an initial cluster escaping from this cluster .",
    "we describe the method of our @xmath0-body simulation in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we show the results of simulations .",
    "section 4 is for summary .",
    "we adopted two models for the galactic center . for both values",
    ", we adopted a model based on a king model with the non - dimensional central potential @xmath3 as galaxy models .",
    "we placed the central smbh with the mass of @xmath4 @xcite and our galaxy models represent the central region of our galaxy ( see figure [ fig : density ] ) .",
    "the difference between two models corresponds to the initial position of a star cluster .",
    "one ( gl ) is for a run with the initial position of the cluster 12.5 pc from the gc , and the other ( gs ) 5 pc from the gc .",
    "their total masses on the real scale ( excluding the smbh ) are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the number of particles is @xmath7 for both models .",
    "gs has better mass - resolution , but a smaller half - mass radius of 9.6 pc .",
    "gl has a larger half - mass radius of 22 pc for the farther initial position of the cluster .",
    "these models are summarized in table [ tb : modelg ] .    as a model of a star cluster",
    ", we adopted a king model with non - dimensional central potential of @xmath8 . for runs from the initial distance of 12.5 pc from the gc",
    ", we used a model with 64k particles and the total mass of @xmath9 ( sc64k ) . for runs from 5pc",
    ", we used a model with 32k particles and the total mass of @xmath10 ( sc32k ) .",
    "initial mass function of stars in the clusters is a salpeter with lower and upper cutoff at 1 and 100 @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "we assigned each star a mass randomly chosen from the salpeter initial mass function , irrespective of its position .",
    "the tidal radii of the models are 1.1 pc for sc64k and 0.65 pc for sc32k .",
    "they are smaller than the tidal limits at their initial positions .",
    "the cluster models are summarized in table [ tb : modelsc ] .",
    "we used the bridge code @xcite to handle the interaction between the parent galaxy and the star cluster fully self - consistently .",
    "the bridge scheme is a tree - direct hybrid scheme .",
    "only the internal motion of the star cluster is calculated by the direct scheme with high accuracy , and all other interactions are calculated by the tree algorithm .",
    "the splitting between the direct part and tree part is through the splitting of the hamiltonian in a way similar to the mixed variable symplectic @xcite . with the bridge scheme , we can treat a large-@xmath0 system with embedded small - scale systems fully self - consistently and accurately .",
    "we used two sets of numerical parameters for each galaxy model .",
    "they are summarized in table [ tb : param ] . in our model ,",
    "the softening length between galaxy particles and the smbh is 0.2 pc .",
    "therefore , our simulation has the resolution limit around 0.2 pc for the motion of the star cluster and cluster stars within the parent galaxy .",
    "we used the opening angle @xmath12 with the center - of - mass approximation for the tree .",
    "the simulation is performed using grape6 @xcite .      in our simulation",
    ", we adopted collisions of stars in a star cluster and formation of an imbh in the cluster .",
    "recent simulations showed that in a dense star cluster , runaway collisions of stars form a very massive star @xcite .",
    "if it is massive enough , it will collapse into an imbh @xcite .",
    "while the massive star grows through collisions , it loses its mass due to the stellar wind .",
    "very massive stars lose their mass rapidly @xcite .",
    "however , these processes are not well understood for stars more massive than @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , we treated the collision criterion and the mass - loss rate as parameters . in this section",
    ", we describe our model of stellar collision and evolution and discuss the difference caused by these parameters .",
    "if the core collapse occurs in the star cluster , collisions between stars in the core occur rather frequently .",
    "we let two stars merge in the star cluster if they approach to twice the sum of stellar radii , which is also adopted in @xcite .",
    "if two stars approach , the tidal capture occurs : the tidal force exerts stellar oscillations and the stars lose their orbital energy and become binary @xcite .",
    "the critical distance for the tidal capture is around 3 - 4 times the radius of the star for two identical stars .",
    "when a tidally captured binary is actually formed , it would merge fairly quickly because of perturbations from nearby stars .",
    "for the radii of stars , we adopted the result of @xcite ( here after hpt00 ) .",
    "the structure of very massive stars with @xmath14 is investigated by @xcite and @xcite , while that of stars more massive than @xmath13 is not .",
    "we used the results of hpt00 for very massive stars with @xmath15 .",
    "massive stars ( @xmath15 ) have a core - halo structure @xcite .",
    "the result of hpt00 we adopted is close to the size of the core in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we adopted twice the sum of the radii as the collision criterion . to see the effect of the different criterion",
    ", we also performed simulations using the sum of the stellar radii as the collision criterion @xcite .",
    "we also take into account the mass loss due to the stellar wind for very massive stars . @xcite",
    "have investigated the mass - loss rate for massive stars with @xmath16 .",
    "however , the stellar evolution of stars with @xmath17 is not well understood .",
    "furthermore , merged stars show a evolution different from that of single stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , we treat the mass - loss rate as a parameter .    our model for the stellar wind is based on line - driven winds developed by castor et al .",
    "( 1975 ; hereafter cak ) .",
    "we used the formalism of @xcite .",
    "the mass - loss rate of the cak model is given by @xmath18 ^{(1-\\alpha)/\\alpha},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the luminosity of the star , @xmath20 is the eddington parameter , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the power index and normalization of the line opacity distribution .",
    "the eddington parameter is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the mass of the star , @xmath25 is the gravitational constant , @xmath26 is the speed of light , and @xmath27 is the opacity .",
    "for fully ionized plasmas with hydrogen mass fraction @xmath28 , the opacity is given by @xmath29 @xmath30 g@xmath31 , where we assumed @xmath32 .",
    "for very massive stars , the luminosity is proportional to the mass because in such massive stars , the contribution of radiation to the total pressure is very large @xcite .",
    "hence , we assumed @xmath33 , here @xmath24 is the mass of the star .",
    "we adopted @xmath34(cak ) , @xmath35 @xcite , @xmath36 ( suzuki , private communication ) , which is close to the eddington luminosity . from these values , we obtained @xmath37 on the other hand , the recent results @xcite show a higher mass - loss rate .",
    "therefore , we also adopted a mass - loss rate five times higher , similar to the result of @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the mass for stars with 1000 @xmath38 initial mass is shown in figure [ fig : mloss ] .",
    "we neglected the mass loss of the stars less than 300 @xmath11 because they are small enough .",
    "we assumed that very massive stars formed by runaway collisions form black holes ( bhs ) at the end of their main - sequence lifetime @xcite . for the lifetime , we adopted the results of hpt00 for stars with masses less than 100 @xmath11 , interpolated the results of @xcite for stars with masses up to 1000 @xmath11 , and extrapolated them for more than 1000 @xmath11 .",
    "we assigned new ages to stars born by stellar collisions using the following formalism of @xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the masses of stars ( @xmath42 ) , @xmath43 is the age of the star , and @xmath44 is the main - sequence lifetime .",
    "the new star looks rejuvenated .",
    "however , the assumption used to derive equation ( [ eq : lifetime ] ) is that the convection core of the primary will occupy the core of the merger with the mass and composition unchanged .",
    "@xcite and also @xcite found that in the case of unequal - mass merger the core of the secondary will first occupy the center of the merger , resulting in significant mixing - in of hydrogen into the new convection core .",
    "so equation ( 4 ) might underestimate the lifetime of the merger .",
    "we assumed that the massive star directly collapses to an bh .",
    "the final evolution of the very massive star depends on its helium core mass at the end of its life .",
    "if it is more massive than @xmath45 , it collapses directly to an bh without mass loss @xcite .",
    "we performed simulation for isolated star clusters and investigated the difference caused by the parameters .",
    "the model of star cluster is sc64k .",
    "the runs are summarized in table [ tb : run1 ] .",
    "each parameter has two values .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : m_star ] .",
    "the difference due to @xmath46 is smaller than that due to the mass - loss rate because the stellar radii is smaller than the radius , but it becomes larger when the mass grows .",
    "the mass - loss rate significantly affects the final mass . in any case , however , the mass accretion rate due to stellar collisions was higher or almost the same as the mass - loss rate",
    ". the mass loss will not prevent the formation of an imbh in the star cluster .",
    "we performed fully self - consistent @xmath0-body simulations of a star cluster and its parent galaxy system .",
    "runs are summarized in table [ tb : run2 ] . for the mass - loss rate and collision criterion , we adopted two extreme cases .",
    "they are upper and lower limits of the mass of imbhs .",
    "the orbit of the star cluster decayed due to the dynamical friction and the cluster was disrupted by the tidal force .",
    "the evolutions of star clusters are shown in figure [ fig : star_cluster ] .",
    "top and middle panels show the orbital and bound - mass evolution of the star clusters .",
    "bottom panels show the mass of the most massive star in the star cluster .",
    "black points in the bottom panels show the times when imbhs formed .    in each case , when the pericenter distance becomes less than 2 pc , the star clusters are almost completely disrupted .",
    "the disruption time , @xmath47 , is summarized in table [ tb : results ] .",
    "we defined the disruption as the time when the number of stars bound to the cluster becomes less than ten .    before the cluster was completely disrupted , an imbh formed in the cluster through the runaway collisions of stars .",
    "a massive star grew via repeated collisions and finally the mass of the massive star reached 3000 - 16000 @xmath11 .",
    "the evolution of the massive star is shown in bottom panels of figure [ fig : star_cluster ] .",
    "the imbh mass strongly depends on the mass - loss rate .",
    "the time when the imbh formed was earlier than the disruption time except for the run hs32k .",
    "these results are summarized in table [ tb : run2 ] .    after the disruption of the star cluster , the imbh formed sinks into the gc on the time scale of the chandrasekhar dynamical friction @xcite .",
    "the time scale of the orbital evolution due to the dynamical friction is proportional to the mass of the star cluster ( imbh ) .",
    "the imbh mass of ld64k is around three times more massive than that of hs64k .",
    "the orbital evolution of ld64k is roughly three times faster than that of hs64k . on the other hand",
    ", the orbital decay of the cluster looks faster than the time scale .",
    "this is because the dynamical friction was enhanced due to the stars escaping from the cluster @xcite .",
    "the orbital evolution of the star cluster became slower and slower at the end of the simulation .",
    "this is because we adopted a large softening length between the smbh and galaxy particle , which is 0.2 pc .",
    "if the softening length were smaller , the cluster would approach closer to the gc and carry resonant stars .",
    "we will perform a simulation with a smaller softening length and report the results in a forthcoming paper .",
    "figure [ fig : snapshot ] shows the projected distribution of stars at the end of the run ( 7.25myrs ) of ld64k .",
    "only stars which were originally members of the star cluster are plotted .",
    "the arrows in the right panel show the proper motions of the stars .",
    "red ones move clockwise and green ones move counterclockwise .",
    "this figure looks very similar to k - band images of the gc ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , they reached a distance of @xmath48 pc from the gc .",
    "we can see that , even though the cluster is almost completely disrupted at 2pc , there are a number of stars which were brought much closer to the central smbh .",
    "we found that many stars were carried near the gc though almost all stars became unbound at around 1 - 2 pc from the gc .",
    "figure [ fig : evolution ] shows how these stars were brought near the central smbh .",
    "red solid curves show the orbit of the star cluster . here",
    ", we plotted the trajectory of six stars of ld64k .",
    "all of them have escaped from the cluster by 3myrs , as can be seen from the separation of black and red curves .",
    "one would imagine that their orbits do not evolve once they have escaped from the cluster .",
    "however , actually these stars `` follow '' the spiral - in of the cluster remnant .",
    "this behavior occurs due to the 1:1 resonance with the imbh formed in the cluster .",
    "these stars have a pericenter distance of less than 0.1pc at the end of the simulation .    in figure",
    "[ fig : evolution ] , stars r1-r4 were brought to the gc by the 1:1 mean motion resonance .",
    "figure [ fig : orbit ] shows the orbit of r1 in a rotating frame where the distance between the smbh and imbh is scaled to unity .",
    "star r1 escaped from the cluster at @xmath49 myr and was orbiting around the smbh until @xmath50 myr . at @xmath50 myr , it was captured into the resonance .",
    "its orbit was a horseshoe orbit for @xmath50 myr to @xmath51 myr . from @xmath51 myr to @xmath52 myr",
    ", the orbit of r1 is that of a retrograde quasi - satellite .",
    "after that , it escaped from the resonance .",
    "stars r2 through r4 show similar behaviors .",
    "their distances from the gc have become smaller by a factor of five or more while they are in the resonance with the imbh .",
    "some of them escape from the resonance on the way to the gc .",
    "some stars are scattered by the imbh during the resonance and change their orbit into those approaching the gc .",
    "we categorized such stars into a resonance and scatter group ( rs ) , and show one example in figure [ fig : evolution ] . in this case",
    ", its semi - major axis does not decrease gradually , but suddenly through close encounters with the imbh ( see figure [ fig : evolution ] , middle - bottom panel ) . these resonant stars ( r and rs ) make up more than 90 % of stars whose pericenter distances , @xmath53 , are less than 0.5 pc from the gc ( table [ tab : origin ] ) .",
    "the right - bottom panel in figure [ fig : evolution ] shows the orbital evolution of a star which escaped from the star cluster by a slingshot occurring in the star cluster .",
    "we categorized such stars into a slingshot group ( s ) .",
    "some of them come very close to the gc .",
    "moreover , these stars have very high inclinations ( some have retrograde orbits ) to the orbital plane of the star cluster because the escape direction from the star cluster is isotropic .",
    "they may be the origin of the stars which have high inclinations in the gc .",
    "table [ tab : origin ] summarizes these results .",
    "we can see that the 1:1 resonance with the imbh is the main mechanism which brings the stars close to the gc .",
    "figure [ fig : n_rp ] shows the cumulative number of escaped stars as a function of pericenter distance at the end of simulations .",
    "solid curves include all stars and dashed curves only massive stars ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "dotted curves show the expected number of stars if the fraction of stars is independent of @xmath53 .",
    "we can see that there is a much larger number of massive stars in the central sub - parsec region than expected from the initial mass function .    in the case of run",
    "ld64k , there are 16 massive stars ( @xmath55 ) with the pericenter distance less than 0.5 pc .",
    "five of the 16 stars reached within 0.2 pc and three reached within 0.1 pc ( see table [ tab : m_stars ] ) .",
    "more than 10 % of stars with @xmath56 pc have masses @xmath57 .",
    "if the distribution of stars does not depend on their masses , the expected number of massive stars for the radius of 0.1pc is around 0.3 .",
    "if there is no mass - dependent evolution effect , the chance that we find more than three stars with @xmath58 pc is @xmath59 . in the other cases ,",
    "a few persent of stars near the gc was massive at @xmath60 ( pc ) and the fraction is higher at more deeper region . in the initial mass function ,",
    "only 0.5% stars have mass more than @xmath61 and @xmath62% after runaway collisions because many massive stars are used up for the formation of the imbh .",
    "figure [ fig : n_rp ] also shows that the number of the trojan stars depends both on the mass of imbh and the spiral - in timescale of imbh .",
    "the number of resonant stars decreases when the imbh mass is smaller .",
    "however , as the imbh spirals in towards the gc in 5 - 6 myrs , the number of trojan stars is not much different from that in our standard run ( ld64k ) .",
    "these results imply that star clusters selectively carry massive stars close to the gc .",
    "massive stars sink to the center of their parent star clusters due to the mass segregation , while the stripping by the tidal force removes less massive stars from the outskirts of star clusters . as a result ,",
    "massive stars tend to remain in star clusters and are carried to a few parsec from the gc before they escape from the cluster .",
    "slingshot stars also include many massive stars because slingshots occur at the center of the star cluster where massive stars are gathering .",
    "thus , star cluster scenarios can naturally explain why massive stars lie within the central parsec .      at the end of the simulation ,",
    "only one massive star is bound to the imbh .",
    "however , several stars were bound till @xmath63 myrs for ld64k .",
    "these bound stars look like irs 13e , which is located at @xmath2 pc in projection from the gc and contains half a dozen massive and young stars within @xmath64 pc . because of their very similar proper motions",
    ", it has been suggested that they are bound to an imbh and irs 13e is the remnant of a star cluster containing an imbh with @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : core ] shows the proper motion of stars bound to the imbh at @xmath66 myr for ld64k .",
    "the tidal radius is 0.15 pc and larger than the frame , but a few stars are within 0.01 pc .",
    "this is similar to the observation of the irs 13e ( see figure 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "using @xmath0-body simulation , we showed that many young and massive stars are carried to the gc by a star cluster due to the 1:1 mean motion resonance with an imbh which is formed in the cluster .",
    "in addition , we found that slingshots in the star cluster throw stars into orbits which pass near the gc .",
    "these orbits have very high inclinations and are sometimes retrograde orbits .",
    "they are new channels which carry young stars to the central parsec .",
    "our simulation demonstrated the existence of massive stars and we explained why they form a disk - like structure .",
    "the possible existence of two counter - rotating disks might suggest that two clusters have spiraled in .",
    "the interaction and resonance between stars and imbhs from multiple clusters might be responsible for the existence of stars which are very close to the central smbh .",
    "the authors thank takeru suzuki for the data of very massive stars , eiichiro kokubo and yusuke tsukamoto for helpful discussions , and the referee , stefan harfst , for useful comments on the manuscript .",
