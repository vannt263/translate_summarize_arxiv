    "in 1943 - 44 , von neumann became convinced that the calculation of the flows of compressible fluids containing strong shocks could be accomplished only by numerical methods .",
    "he conceived the idea of capturing shocks , i.e. , of ignoring the presence of a discontinuity . employing a lagrangian description of compressible flow , setting heat conduction and viscosity equal to zero , von neumann replaced space and time derivatives by symmetric difference quotients .",
    "calculations using this scheme were carried out ; the approximation resulting from these calculations ( see @xcite ) showed oscillations on the mesh scale behind the shock .",
    "von neumann boldly conjectured that the oscillations in velocity represent the heat energy created by the irreversible action of the shock , and that as @xmath1 and @xmath2 tend to zero , the approximate solutions tend in the weak sense to the discontinuous solution of the equations of compressible flow .",
    "in @xcite it was counterconjectured that von neumann was wrong in his surmise , i.e. , that although the approximate solutions constructed by his method do converge weakly , the weak limit fails to satisfy the law of conservation of energy",
    ".    in @xcite j.goodman and p.lax investigated von neumann s algorithm applied to the scalar equation @xmath3 ( it is called the hopf equation @xcite ) , in the semidiscrete case . using numerical experimentation and analytical techniques the demonstrated the weak convergence of the oscillatory approximations , and that the weak limit fails to satisfy the scalar equation in question .    von neumann s dream of capturing shocks was realized in his joint work with richtmyer in 1950 , see @xcite .",
    "oscillations were eliminated by the judicious use of artificial viscosity ; solutions constructed by this method converge uniformly except in a neighborhood of shocks , where they remain bounded and are spread out over a few mesh intervals .",
    "the limits appear to satisfy the conservation laws of compressible flow .",
    "the conservation of mass and momentum is the consequence of having approximated these equations by difference equations in conservation form ; but the von neumann - richtmyer difference approximation to the energy equation is not in conservation form .    in the paper @xcite t.hou and p.lax",
    "compared the results of a von neumann - richtmyer calculation with the weak limit of of calculations performed by von neumann s original method .",
    "the aim of this paper , at first , it is to introduce the idea of understanding of conservation laws ; the second is to proposed a numerical method for calculation of hydrodynamic shocks profile _ without using differences schemes_.    we believe that there is no discontinues in the nature of shocks . discontinues solution of hydrodynamic equations only a rough mathematical model of shocks .",
    "when viscosity is taken into account , for example , the shocks are seen to be smeared out , so that the pure mathematical surface of discontinuety are replaced by the thin layers ( @xmath4@xmath5 m ) in which pressure , density , temperature and etc .",
    "vary rapidly but continuosly ( see fig.[fi0 ] ) .",
    "the equations of compressible flow in one space dimension can be written in the following lagrangian form : @xmath6 it is a classical approach . here",
    "@xmath7 is velocity , @xmath8 is pressure , @xmath9 specific volume , and @xmath10 internal energy , connected with @xmath8 and @xmath9 via an equation of state .",
    "here we mostly study the case when the equation of state is given by the @xmath11-law with @xmath12 @xmath13 substituting that into the ( [ system0 ] ) we get the following equation @xmath14 the first equation of ( [ system0 ] ) is conservation of momentum , the second equation conservation of mass , the third the work equation .",
    "we will consider a steady - state shock .",
    "imagine a long pipe containing a fluid initially in equilibrium ( thermally and mechanically ) , into which a piston is pushing from one end with constant speed , as shown in fig.[fi0 ] . in the presence of dissipation the specific volume , @xmath9 , and the fluid velocity , @xmath7 are as shown by the curves .",
    "_ our problem is to calculate the exact shape of this curves . _",
    "the shock is steady , at least approximately , after it has gone to a sufficiently great distance from the initiating piston .",
    "then @xmath15 , etc .",
    "depend on @xmath16 and @xmath17 only through the combination @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a speed of the shock relative to the original , or lagrangian , coordinates .",
    "now , we are going to study the equations ( [ system0 ] ) in specific sense .",
    "namely , we are going to rewrite mentioned equations in the sense of @xmath0distributions .",
    "we give the definition of the special kind of solutions of the some conservation laws in the sense of @xmath0-distributions and consider the method for the numerical calculations of the smooth shocks and soliton like solutions of the hopf equation and equations of compressible flow in the mentioned sense . this method based on orthogonal system of the hermite functions as a base for calculation of such solutions ( i.e. shocks and infinitely narrow solitons ) .",
    "calculations of profiles of infinitely narrow soliton and shock wave are reduced to the nonlinear system of algebraic equations in @xmath20 , @xmath21",
    ". we proved , using the schauder fixed point theorem @xcite , that the mentioned system has at least one solution in @xmath20 .",
    "we showed that there is possibility to find out some of the solutions of this system using the newton iteration method @xcite .",
    "we considered examples and numerical tests .",
    "we also should emphasis that proposed numerical approach do not use a difference scheme ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider a bit of theory which we will apply to conservation laws .",
