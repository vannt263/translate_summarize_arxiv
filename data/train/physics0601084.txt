    "nowadays , the standard classical electrodynamics is perceived as the paradigm of a causal and deterministic classical field theory .",
    "the most general approach to the calculation of electric and magnetic fields is explicable in terms of the so - called lienard - wiechert potentials .",
    "their conventional form in the case of an arbitrary moving classical point charge of magnitude @xmath1 is given as@xmath2 :    @xmath3 _ { ret};\\qquad \\mathbf{a}=\\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon _ { 0}}\\left [ \\frac{\\frac{\\mathbf{u}}{c}}{r-\\frac{\\mathbf{u\\cdot r}}{c}}\\right ] _ { ret }   \\label{uno}\\ ] ]    where the corresponding quantity in brackets means that it is evaluated at the retarded time @xmath4 ; @xmath5 is the distance from the retarded position of the charge to the point of observation and @xmath6 is a velocity of a charge at the instant of time @xmath7 .    as our intention to make clear the main proposals of this work , we first discuss the fundamental underlying structure of existing solutions .",
    "electric and magnetic field values @xmath8 and @xmath9 are related to potentials ( [ uno ] ) by the equations :    @xmath10    straightforward application of operations ( [ dos ] ) performed on ( [ uno ] ) provides the standard expression for field strengths of an arbitrary moving point charge@xmath2 :    @xmath11 _ { ret}+\\left [ \\frac{\\mathbf{n}}{k^{3}r}\\times \\left\\ { \\left ( \\mathbf{n}-\\frac{\\mathbf{u}}{c}\\right ) \\times \\frac{\\mathbf{\\dot{u}}}{c}\\right\\ } \\right ] _ { ret}\\right\\ }",

    "the first terms @xmath18 and @xmath19 are usually regarded as _ velocity fields _ because they are independent of acceleration @xmath20 .",
    "the electric velocity field @xmath18 falls off as @xmath21 that is the substantial feature of the radial ( longitudinal ) field components associated with the static coulomb law . by this reason the velocity fields",
    "are also referred as _ bound or longitudinal fields_. on the contrary , the second parts of solutions ( tri)-([cuatro ] ) , denoted as @xmath22 and @xmath23 are linear functions of acceleration , falling off proportional to @xmath24 .",
    "these terms are responsible for the radiation and take no place in the case of uniformly moving charge ( as well as at rest ) , giving priority to bound components in the formation of electromagnetic ( em ) field .",
    "the latter fact poses a question of considerable fundamental interest concerning the nature and physical characteristics on bound fields .",
    "it implies a fundamental question of whether the applicability of the standard retardation condition to all components of electromagnetic field has solid theoretical , methodological and empirical grounds .",
    "put in other terms , should be there an explicit empirical test of the applicability of the retardation condition to bound field components ?",
    "doubts about the soundness of the conventional treatment of bound fields appear already when one studies the transition between the initial state of rest ( or uniform motion ) and the subsequent state of acceleration of the charge .",
    "the origin of this important insight resides in the belief that a fully consistent approach to classical electrodynamics demands the continuity of electromagnetic phenomena in all situations .",
    "this allowable inference was recently explored in@xmath25 .",
    "the mathematical analysis of boundary - value problems for dalembert and poisson s equations showed that the present set of solutions to maxwell s equations does not ensure the continuity in transition between , on one hand , the general case of an arbitrary moving charge and , on the other hand , the static or quasi - static ( uniform motion ) limits .",
    "independent approach implemented in@xmath26 also unambiguously indicates that the transition between two different states of uniform velocity of a charge via an intermediate state of acceleration results in a type of discontinuity in functional form .",
    "the peculiar historical background of the classical em theory gives an additional motivation to focus our attention on bound fields .",
    "the problem of propagation of em interactions was the crucial point in choosing appropriate theoretical foundations for classical electrodynamics in the 19th century . by the time hertz began his experiments in providing evidence in favor of em",
    "waves in air , the set of fundamental solutions to maxwell s equations did not imply any explicit separation into bound and radiation field components . only lorentz s modification of maxwell s theory ( 1892 ) provided lienard ( 1898 ) and wiechert ( 1901 ) with inhomogeneous wave equations .",
    "the retarded solutions were found under the retardation constraint which , as it is generally accepted , was just experimentally verified by hertz in 1888@xmath27 .",
    "it gave a rise to the fact that bound and radiation field components of lienard - wiechert solutions propagate at the same rate .",
    "thus , in light of our discussion we can see that hertz s experiments were not especially thought - out to bring solid empirical grounds on the physical characteristics of bound fields as well as to test the applicability of the retardation constraint on them . in modern retrospective",
    ", this uncertainty in respect to bound components might imply some sort of methodological incompleteness in hertz s experimental approach as it has been recently inferred in@xmath28 and , therefore , any attempt to provide a fuller experimental information on bound fields acquires a fundamental importance in the framework of the classical em theory . as response to these conceptual questions ,",
    "in this work we propose _ an experimental approach _ to velocity ( bound ) fields to test the applicability of the standard retardation constraint to bound field components .",
    "recently , hertzs - type experiment has already been attempted@xmath29 in order to remove above - mentioned uncertainties in respect to electric bound field components .",
    "however , no explicit information was obtained as regards to the nature of electric bound fields and the front of the detected signal apparently propagated at the light velocity as it is assumed in the standard em theory .",
    "however , the subsequent analysis showed that there was no preliminary theoretical estimation of the relative contribution of bound and radiation components into the final signal .",
    "this estimation is crucial if one takes into account that em radiation terms fall off as @xmath24 and at large distances predominate , determining the time shift of the signal front measured by oscilloscope .",
    "additionally , the chosen spheroid shape of the receiving antenna used in experimental measurements made it especially unsensitive to the direction of the propagating electric field .",
    "there is also another experimental difficulty connected to the estimation of the relative contribution of bound components when the radiation is very intensive , i.e. for frequencies @xmath30 @xmath31 .",
    "in fact , the intensity of em radiation rapidly increases with @xmath32 , hence hindering the sensitivity of measuring devices in respect to bound fields that fall off as @xmath21 .",
    "contrarily , for the low frequency radiation the time resolution of registration systems decreases considerably and results insufficient to measure any em signal with due precision . without such preliminary discussion and analysis ,",
    "the experimental approach effected in@xmath29 looks rather unreliable .",
    "put in other terms , one can not avoid the preliminary calculation of an optimal range of variations of @xmath5 and @xmath32 in which the experimental treatment of bound fields might be attended with expected precision .",
    "in addition to the feebleness of the effects produces by bound fields that fall off as @xmath21 , there are also several technical circumstances that make direct observation of bound fields an extremely difficult task .",
    "all known radiation devices ( antennas etc ) are designed to enhance the radiation to the utmost , i.e. to reach the maximum value of the ratio of radiation - to - bound field strength . in other words",
    ", the use of radiation devices in their traditional form can be rather counterproductive and , therefore , there should be a radically different experimental approach based on a substantial rise of the ratio of bound - to - radiation field strength .",
    "as follows , we shall present an experimental scheme that is methodologically conceived to surmount all above - mentioned technical difficulties and to provide unambiguous explicit information on bound magnetic components .",
    "the main idea of our method is based on the analysis of em field in the plane of the loop antenna with oscillating current .",
    "section @xmath33 is devoted to the underlying idea of how the spreading velocity of bound magnetic fields can be measured in an idealized case . in section",
    "@xmath34 a methodological approach will be described in more details as concerns a particular experimental set - up ( described in section 4 ) which implements multi - section type of antennas in order to increase the ratio of bound - to - radiation field strenght .",
    "finally , section 5 presents results of numerical calculations and their comparison with experimental data .",
    "this section will be devoted to the illustration of the background of the consistent methodological approach to empirical identification of bound magnetic fields . by analogy with the retarded vector potential @xmath35",

    "( [ ocho ] ) has a general applicability to usual electric circuits since the velocity of conduction electrons is always much lower than @xmath41 . the first term on the right hand side of expression ( [ ocho ] ) is the classical integral form of the biot - savart law when the current @xmath52 in the circuit @xmath49 is steady ( i.e. @xmath53 ) .",
    "the velocity dependent ( bound ) component @xmath19 arises from the term proportional to @xmath54 $ ] whereas the acceleration field @xmath23 is due to the @xmath55 $ ] term .",
    "traditionally , in the general ( time - dependent ) case solutions to corresponding dalembert equations are found under the retardation constraint applied to the whole electromagnetic field , hence providing the same spreading velocity to bound and radiation fields as it takes place in the standard eq .",
    "( [ ocho ] ) . in view of overwhelming empirical evidences that radiation components propagate at the velocity of light @xmath41 , we keep the standard retardation constraint unmodified in respect to acceleration fields @xmath23 .",
    "contrarily , we assume that there is no explicit empirical evidence on the way how bound fields propagate in empty space . using the underlying structure of the eq .",
    "( [ ocho ] ) , we are now in a position to deal with bound and acceleration fields separately and to explore a wide range of hypothetic retardation constraints in respect to bound components , i.e. the situation when the spreading velocity of bound fields @xmath19 , denoted as @xmath56 , varies continuously in the range @xmath57 . in the context of this hypothesis ,",

    "the introduction of the dissimilar approaches to the treatment of bound and radiation fields adds to the difficulty of its justification in the framework of the conventional classical electrodynamics .",
    "the theoretical exploration of this case will conceivably imply the extension of foundations and perhaps the rise of new concepts .",
    "one possible justification might be based on the use of a two - parameter lorentz - like gauge ( so - called @xmath56-gauge)@xmath60 which leaves original maxwell s equations unmodified and introduces an arbitrary propagational velocity @xmath57 for scalar components of electric field ( i.e. they can be identified with bound fields ) .",
    "recently , @xmath56-gauge approach is widely discussed as a possible explanation of apparently superluminal group velocity of evanescent waves@xmath61 . even though the foundations of the hypothetic distinction of propagational velocities of bound and radiation components remain at present stage unclear , the use of eq .",
    "( [ ochoa ] ) allows us to conceive a general methodological scheme capable to test the applicability of the standard retardation constraint to bound fields , i.e. the case @xmath62 .",
    "certainly , any discrepancy between experimental observations and theoretical predictions based on the condition @xmath62 would not automatically imply the correctness of our hypothesis in form of the eq . ( [ ochoa ] ) but rather no applicability of the standard retardation constraint to bound fields . in the latter case @xmath63 , the eq .",
    "( [ ochoa ] ) can be taken as a first approximation to make theoretical predictions that can be verified by experiment .",
    "for further convenience , let us resort to a certain idealization in our attempt to use the basic equation ( [ ochoa ] ) in a less cumbersome representation , keeping untouched all fundamental features related to the bound and radiation components . by these reasons ,",
    "we first consider an example of idealized oscillating magnetic dipole given in form of a loop antenna with the radius @xmath64 .",
    "it will be assumed that the magnetic dipole moment @xmath65 varies harmonically with time at the angular frequency @xmath32 .",
    "then the idealization implies two requirements : @xmath66 the radius of the loop @xmath64 is considerably smaller than the distance @xmath5 from the center of the antenna to the point of observation ; @xmath67 the wavelength @xmath68 of emitted em radiation greatly exceeds the perimeter of the loop , i.e. @xmath69 .",
    "the second requirement means that at a given frequency @xmath32 the magnitude of conduction current has nearly the same value @xmath52 in all parts of the loop circuit at a present instant of time @xmath70 .",

    "notice also that the _ quasi - stationary current _ approximation remains valid for bound components in the whole range @xmath75 i.e. @xmath76 .    having assumed the above idealizations , the alternative expression ( ochoa ) results considerably simplified . by analogy with the standard procedure@xmath50 (",
    "a reader interested in a full derivation can found it in the appendix ) , all contributions into the magnetic field in the plane of an oscillating magnetic dipole are :    @xmath77 _ { v}}{r^{3}}+\\frac{c}{v}\\frac{\\left [ \\dot{i}\\right ]",

    "( [ nueve ] ) have the common origin and arise from the bound component @xmath19 .",
    "the contribution proportional to @xmath80 is a dynamic counterpart of a steady magnetic field produced by a static magnetic dipole of magnitude @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath21-term is due to a finite size of the antenna loop which stipulates the difference  in the value of retarded time @xmath81 for em signals out - coming from different segments of the perimeter of ea .",
    "in other words , a bound field perturbation emitted from the nearest half - part of the loop arrives at the point of observation before an equivalent signal from the farthest half - part .",
    "this retarded time shift leads to the contribution proportional to @xmath82 or @xmath83 ( for a more detailed explanation , see appendix ) .",
    "the last @xmath24-term is submitted to the standard retardation constraint @xmath62 and corresponds to the magnetic dipole radiation which falls off as @xmath24 .",
    "let us now take into consideration a receiving loop antenna ( ra ) under the set of approximations assumed earlier for the ea .",
    "let us place both ea and ra loops in the same plane @xmath84 as it is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the origin of the coordinate frame coincides with the center of the ea loop and @xmath85 denotes the position - vector of the center of the ra loop .  the generation of an electromotive force ( e.m.f . )",

    "@xmath87    the time variation of the magnetic field @xmath88 in the area of the ra is determined by the frequency of oscillations @xmath32 of the conduction current @xmath72 in the circuit of the ea .",

    "the second @xmath21-term disappears in the strong limit @xmath93 . in this hypothetic case",
    ", there is no retardation for bound fields and at the point of observation every perturbation emitted from the nearest half - part of the loop will be counteracted by an equivalent signal from the farthest half - part .",
    "therefore , the _ in - plane _ geometry shown in fig.1 should be sensitive to any variation of the parameter @xmath56 , since it directly affects the value of the second @xmath21-term .",
    "this fundamental feature allows us to formulate a methodology of a consistent experimental approach to bound magnetic components . obviously , as it has already been inferred in the introduction , any practical realization of the above - considered scheme may be accompanied by a number of rather delicate technical difficulties .",
    "so , in our approach to idealization of experimental conditions , let us first assume that the current @xmath72 in the ea oscillates harmonically at the angular frequency @xmath32 as @xmath94 .",
    "then , an observer can measure the phase of the e.m.f .",
    "@xmath95 induced in the ra and compare it with the phase of some reference harmonic signal @xmath96 . in the following , we shall show how it can be implemented .    in the approximation of harmonic conduction current in the ea , eq .",

    "@xmath101 are functions of @xmath5 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 but at large distances @xmath5 , the radiation term proportional to @xmath104 predominates .",
    "therefore , the phase of the radiation term @xmath105 can be taken for the definition of the reference signal @xmath106 :    @xmath107    if the range of variations @xmath57 is assumed , there are two natural limit cases : @xmath108 @xmath62 and @xmath109 @xmath93 .",
    "considering the first limit , which corresponds to the standard assumption , eq .",
    "( [ trece ] ) takes the form :    @xmath110    the first subplot in fig.@xmath33 shows the comparison between the signal @xmath111 induced in the ra and the reference signal @xmath106 , according to their evolution with @xmath5 and @xmath70 . in the second subplot of fig.@xmath33",
    "we specify relative contributions of @xmath80 , @xmath21 and @xmath24-terms and their mutual harmonic phase shifts . it explains why @xmath111 and @xmath106 are not synchronized , i.e. there is always a finite time shift @xmath112 between instants when both signals @xmath111 and @xmath106 cross a zero line .",
    "however , at large distances the radiation @xmath24-term predominates considerably so that @xmath80 , @xmath21-terms can be referred only as weak perturbations of the dominant @xmath24-component . in other words , the signal @xmath111 tends to take the harmonic form proportional to @xmath113 , hence forcing the time shift @xmath112 to vanish at large distances ( far field zone ) .",
    "the same analysis is also applicable in the general case for the whole range of variations of the parameter @xmath56 , i.e. @xmath57 .",
    "in fig.@xmath34 we show diagrams that correspond to the second hypothetic limit @xmath114 . at short distances ,",
    "there is also clearly visible finite time shift @xmath112 when both signals @xmath115 and @xmath106 cross a zero line .",
    "we remind here that in this limit case the contribution proportional to @xmath21 disappears so that only @xmath80 and @xmath24-terms can be seen in the second sub - diagram of fig.@xmath34 . moreover ,",
    "if at distances @xmath116 the first @xmath80-term results already negligible in comparison with @xmath24-term ( it will be fulfilled in our experimental conditions ) the variation of the time shift @xmath117 does not exhibit any oscillations as it is shown in fig.@xmath118 .",
    "we have thus reached the conclusion that the type of variation of @xmath117 is very sensitive to the particular value of the parameter @xmath56 and hence can be subjected to the empirical test .",
    "further on we shall refer this approach as a _ zero crossing method_.    summarizing the discussion of idealized antennas , we would like to emphasize that the requirements imposed by this approximation are hardly available in real experimental practice .",
    "on the one hand , the value of the e.m.f . @xmath119 depends essentially on the radius @xmath64 of the loop antenna because it is proportional to @xmath120 . on the other hand , in order to reach the criteria of the quasi - stationary current approximation , one can not decrease the radius @xmath64 without moderation , since the precision of measurements critically depends on the intensity of ea and ra signals .",
    "therefore , there should be a balance between mutually excluding requirements . in our attempt to reduce dependence on the radius of the loop",
    "@xmath64 , we resorted to the help of so - called multi - section antennas . as we will show in the next section , the approximation of _ quasi - stationary current _ and",
    "the maximum ratio of bound - to - radiation field strength can be easily implemented for finite size multi - section antennas ( even in the range of high frequencies @xmath32 ) , keeping valid the approach based on the zero crossing method .",
    "in this section we shall discuss the methodology of experimental approach to bound fields in the case of multi - section emitting and receiving antennas which constitutes a practical realization of particular experimental scheme considered in section 4 .",
    "the ea and ra are composed from four and two sections , respectively , as it is shown in fig.@xmath121 .",
    "the arrows mean directions of conduction currents at some given instant of time .",
    "therefore , the symmetric form of multi - section emitting and receiving antennas implies no net current in radial directions .",
    "this property is important to reduce considerably undesirable electric dipole radiation in the case of ea and , in addition , to suppress any disturbing effect produced by electric dipole radiation in ra .",
    "put in other terms , it provides us with a higher ratio of bound - to - radiation field strength ( note that standard antennas are designed to reach the highest ratio of radiation - to - bound field strength in order to enhance the radiation ) .",
    "this circumstance is of crucial importance as concerns empirical observations of bound magnetic fields as well as the precision of measurements .    in respect to the approximation of quasi - stationary current",
    ", the use of multi - section antennas improves considerably the basic criteria @xmath69 .",
    "in fact , all radial parts of  each section make no contribution in generation of magnetic fields ( bound or radiation ) due to the cancelation of current flows in adjacent parts of neighbor sections .",
    "it stands out the role played by the arc fragment of every section , being thus the only part of the multi - section antenna capable to produce magnetic fields . since the resultant magnetic field",
    "is determined entirely as a superposition of magnetic fields created by each section , then the applicability of the approximation of quasi - stationary current resides on its validity for each section . as a consequence , we can consider the criteria for the quasi - stationary current approximation of a multi - section antenna as :    @xmath122    where @xmath123 denotes the critical value of the frequency of oscillations and @xmath124 means the number of sections .",
    "thus , the use of multi - section type of antennas was fully justified in our approach by the above - exposed practical reasons .",
    "let us now describe a technical realization of the experimental set - up as regards the emitting multi - section antenna ( see fig.@xmath125 ) .",
    "a fast high - voltage spark gap ( sg ) constitutes the driving circuit of the ea and it is connected with the multi - section emitting circuit via the blocking capacitor @xmath126 which also plays the role of the energy storage element .",
    "the whole circuit , presented in fig.@xmath125 , can be viewed as @xmath127-contour with the proper frequency @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the inductance of the ea .",
    "we also assume that the values of @xmath129 , @xmath126 and the radius @xmath64 are given in the range of applicability of the approximation of quasi - stationary current , i.e. @xmath130 . the high - voltage supply ( hv ) is connected to the ea via the resistor @xmath131 .",

    "the magnitude of the initial current flow in the ea depends on the value of high - voltage @xmath132 and the discharge time @xmath133 .",
    "the technical realization described above and presented in fig.@xmath125 , generally speaking , does not imply harmonic oscillations in the circuit of the ea . as a consequence ,",
    "further on we shall assume the exponential character of the discharge process , i.e. @xmath134 and the shape of the emitted signal will be conditioned by the kirchhoff equation for the emitting circuit :    @xmath135    where @xmath136 is the characteristic resistance of the ea .",

    "based on these results , one can conclude that empirical data unambiguously indicate on the non - applicability of the standard retardation constraint ( @xmath62 ) to bound fields .",
    "since the standard classical electrodynamics is generally acknowledged nowadays as the most orthodox example of a causal and deterministic classical field theory , one can suppose that the standard theory may contain certain ( perhaps , empirically unverified ) causal assumptions which go beyond what is fair to assume in the framework of the mathematical formalism .",
    "the first experimental indication on a difference between propagation velocity of bound and radiation fields can be regarded as an unexpected causal asymmetry in the structure of possible solutions to maxwell s equations .",
    "the latter has no grounds in the formalism of the existing electromagnetic theory and implies that a possible interpretive framework can be wider than the standard account allows . in our opinion , the presence of this fundamental uncertainty in the classical em theory is due to the fact that perhaps there has not been realized the considerable importance in careful drawing and empirical testing distinction between bound and radiation field components . put in other terms , it has to imply a considerable shift of attention towards the conception of the velocity dependent ( bound ) components of em field because they may result of a crucial importance in illuminating alternative foundations of the classical electrodynamics .    in this respect",
    ", advocates of alternative views may appeal to the fact that at the time of hertz experiments on propagation of em interactions there was already a consistent rival approach to electromagnetic phenomena that emphasized the distinction between spreading velocity of bound and radiation em field components . in the history of physics it is regarded as helmholtz s electrodynamics@xmath221 .",
    "moreover , maxwell s equations appeared in helmholtz s theoretical scheme in a limit when the spreading velocity of bound ( electrostatic in helmholtz s classification ) electric components tended to infinity . in this case , the propagation velocity of radiation waves ( electrodynamic components in helmholtz s classification ) resulted equal to the velocity of light as it was assumed in maxwell s theory ( for more details , see@xmath222 ) . recently , the same conclusion on a possibility of essential difference between spreading velocity of bound and radiation em field components was obtained in completely independent and mathematically consistent approaches to the classical electromagnetic theory based on maxwell s equations@xmath223 .",
    "we also have to point out the fact of a nearly perfect coincidence between experimental data and theoretical predictions based on the eq .",
    "( [ ochoa ] ) for the spreading velocity of bound fields highly exceeding the velocity of light ( @xmath224 ) .",
    "this circumstance can be considered as a strong indication on the validity of a new generalized biot - savart law in form similar to the eq .",
    "( [ ochoa ] ) which differs form the generally accepted expression ( ocho ) only as regards the spreading velocity of bound components , i.e. the condition @xmath57 .    nevertheless , speaking in strict terms , any discrepancy of experimental observations with theoretical predictions made on the basis of the standard condition @xmath62 does not automatically imply the correctness of our hypothesis in form of the eq .",
    "( [ ochoa ] ) but rather experimentally observed violation of the applicability of the standard retardation condition to bound fields . by its significance and importance , this experimental fact may be comparable with the violation of bell s inequalities in quantum mechanics .",
    "it is very likely that both manifestations of non - locality might have the same origin .",
    "moreover , we are inclined to think that non - local characteristics of bound fields shed a new promising light on a possible close relationship between classical electrodynamics and quantum mechanics .    having in mind the challenge of measuring very feeble effects produced by bound fields , we have introduced into experimental practice multi - section emitting and receiving antennas that are designed to rise substantially the ratio of bound - to - radiation field strength .",
    "however , our experimental experience led us to the conclusion that a direct measurement of the spreading velocity of bound fields still must be qualified as a rather difficult task even if one implements experimental facilities available in modern physics laboratories . in this respect",
    ", we would like to emphasize some technical circumstances of our experimental approach . due to a rapid fall of bound field amplitudes as @xmath21 and @xmath80 ,",
    "the range of variation @xmath225 of the distance between emitting and receiving antennas has been essentially restricted by approximately @xmath226 .",
    "if we consider em waves travelling with the velocity of light @xmath41 , the difference @xmath227 means the time shift @xmath228 . in order to achieve a necessary precision of measurements ( within the time range of @xmath184 ) , the front of a generated signal must not exceed the value of @xmath203 , ( i.e. @xmath229 for a period of one quasi - harmonic signal ) which corresponds to the angular frequency @xmath230 .",
    "numerical calculations show that a typical size of antenna ( emitting at the frequency @xmath231 ) is about several @xmath232 and , therefore , at small distances ( for instance , @xmath233 ) comparable with the size of the ea , the amplitude of the output signal should be of the order of @xmath234 .",
    "the crucial parameter that is the ratio of bound - to - radiation field strength also falls down rapidly with the distance as approximately @xmath235 . in our experiments ,",
    "this ratio is close to unity at @xmath236 and results negligible already at distances exceeding @xmath226 .",
    "hence , if there is an intention to produce any observable separation of bound and radiation components at @xmath237 , the value of the ratio of bound - to - radiation field strength has to be close to unity at this distance , i.e. one has to assume that @xmath238 .",
    "it implies a considerable rise of the front of generated signals up to nearly @xmath239 which already will exceed the permissible time shift of about @xmath184 , making impossible any visual distinction between bound and radiation contributions into the resultant signal .",
    "thus , at present stage these circumstances made it almost unattainable task to undertake direct measurements of spreading velocity of bound magnetic fields .",
    "having in mind experimental facilities available at the time of hertz s experiments ( 1886 - 1891 ) , we might intuitively assume that the problem of propagation of electromagnetic interactions could hardly have been resolved definitely at the end of the 19th century in  favor of one of the rival theories ( maxwell s or helmholtz s electrodynamics ) .",
    "nevertheless , in contrast to our possible reservations , hertz s contemporaries accepted his experiments almost unconditionally , i.e. by the beginning of the 20th century the problem of propagation of electromagnetic interactions had been considered as definitely resolved .",
    "it gave a rise to the conviction that the standard retardation condition ( @xmath62 ) has a general validity for all components of em field .",
    "in this respect , we stress again that hertz s experiments were not especially thought - out to test the applicability of the retardation condition to bound fields , since at the time of hertz s experiments the classical electromagnetism had not yet been completed in its modern theoretical framework . therefore , from the point of view of the modern em theory , this fact implies a methodological incompleteness of hertz s experimental approach . in our opinion , these historical circumstances combined with the extreme feebleness of the effects produced by bound fields deprived the majority of physicists ( from the beginning of the 20th century up till now ) of the interest towards experimental study of bound fields properties .",

    "santamaria rueda ( moscow , russia ) for financial support which resulted crucial in the realization of this project .",
    "first , it is worth reminding that eq .",
    "( [ ocho ] ) was obtained in@xmath42 at the low velocity relativistic limit of the exact solution ( seis ) of the dalembert equation ( [ siete ] ) when the centripetal acceleration of the moving charges is ignored .",
    "the latter requirement implies that in places where the antenna loop is curved , the current flow @xmath72 and the rate of time variation of current @xmath240 are parallel to the tangential direction along the loop . to illustrate the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ nueve ] ) from the hypothetical general case driven by eq .",
    "( [ ochoa ] ) , we shall use the same assumptions as it is done in@xmath42 and follow the analogous procedure implemented in@xmath50 .",
    "thus , if the radius @xmath64 of the loop of the antenna is negligible in comparison with the distance to the point of observation @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath241 , then the shape of the antenna has no importance and it can be chosen in a way to simplify theoretical calculations .",
    "so , let us consider the small current carrying coil _",
    "abcd _ shown  in fig.@xmath242 .",
    "the arrow indicates the direction of the flowing current .",
    "the sections _ ad _ and _ bc _ are arcs circles , with centers at the point of observation @xmath243 .",
    "both circles have the radius value @xmath5 and @xmath244 respectively , where @xmath245 .",
    "thus , if the length of the section _ ad _ is equal to @xmath246 ( where @xmath241 ) , then the length of _ bc _ is @xmath247 .",
    "let us now determine the magnetic field @xmath9 at the point of observation @xmath243 and at the time of observation @xmath70 . according to eq .",
    "( ochoa ) the contributions of the currents in the sections _ ab _ and _ cd _ are both zero since @xmath248 .",
    "thus , we can calculate the value of the magnetic field generated only by the sections _ bc _ and _ ad _ :                  the circumstance that the section _ ad",
    "_  is placed closer to the point of observation @xmath243 means that any signal travelling with the finite velocity and produced in this section at some initial instant @xmath253 will arrive at the point @xmath243 earlier than its _ bc _ counterpart , generated at the same time @xmath253 .    under the assumption @xmath57 , bound components of the magnetic fields @xmath254 and @xmath255 arrive at the point of observation @xmath243 with different values of retardation time @xmath256 and @xmath257 respectively .",
    "therefore , both values of current @xmath258 _ { v}$ ] in ( [ a2 ] ) and ( [ a3 ] ) have been generated at different initial instants of time @xmath259 and @xmath260 , where @xmath70 is the time of observation at @xmath243 .",
