    "the transmission matrix @xmath132 given by ( [ tom ] ) is an essential ingredient in the evaluation of the cgf .",

    "it is interesting that the tails in the @xmath156 distribution are determined only by the reservoir temperatures .",
    "in the present paper we have extended our previous work on the cumulant generating function and the large deviation function for the simple harmonic chain to the case of an alternating mass chain . from a technical point of view",
