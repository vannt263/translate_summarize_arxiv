    "the motion equations are given by    @xmath20    [ eq : hamiltonequations ]    where @xmath21 .",
    "accordingly , by introducing eq.([eq : hamiltonian ] ) into eq.([eq : hamiltonequations ] ) we obtain    @xmath22    [ eq : motionequations ]    from eq.([eq : hamiltonian ] ) and the normalization condition @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 for space - like , null and time - like curves ) we have the condition @xmath25 on the another hand , from eq.([eq : motionequations1 ] ) and eq.([eq : motionequations2 ] ) we have , @xmath26 and also @xmath27 respectively .",
    "whereas , from eq.([eq : motionequations3 ] ) and eq.([eq : motionequations4 ] ) we obtain    @xmath28    where @xmath29    we can write the last system in the form    @xmath30    where @xmath31 @xmath32 is called the `` effective potential '' ( see equations ( 3.68 ) pg . 160 in @xcite ) . in terms of the solution in eq.([eq : solutions ] ) , one obtains    @xmath33    where @xmath34 thus the three - dimensional motion of the particle in an axis - symmetric potential can be reduced to the two - dimensional motion of the particle in a `` newtonian potential '' @xmath12 .      to study the circular motion of the test charged particle we start with the conditions @xmath36 then , from the first of these equations , eqs.([eq : hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ eq : hamiltonianexplic ] ) , we have the energy of the particle @xmath37 from the second condition in eq.([eq : firstconditions * ] ) we have @xmath38 notice that if @xmath39 , from eqs.([eq : energy * ] ) and ( [ eq : w ] ) , we obtain @xmath40 thus , by introducing the corresponding metric coefficients of the line element in eq.([eq : metric ] ) , such as @xmath41 which lacks of physical meaning .",
    "hence , the condition @xmath42 is equivalent to @xmath43    the minimum radius for stable circular orbit occurs in the inflection points of the effective potential .",
    "thus we must solve the equation @xmath44 or , equivalently , to solve the equation @xmath45 on the other hand , by calculating the derivative respect to @xmath3 in both sides of eq.([eq : energy * ] ) we obtain for the angular moment @xmath46 where @xmath47 and we have used the einstein - maxwell equation @xmath48 . by substituting this value for @xmath49 in ( [ eq : energy * ] ) we obtain the energy of the particle @xmath50 since the lagrangian in eq.([eq : lagrangian ] ) does not depend explicitly on the variables @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and one can obtain the following two conserved quantities @xmath53 and also @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath49 are , respectively , the energy and the angular momentum of the particle as measured by an observer at rest at infinity .",

    ", we investigate a toomre - kuzmin - like potential since we are dealing with an axisymmetric system , which has the form @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a unitary free parameter to guarantee the correct units , and straightforwardly , one can get the expression @xmath72 and , after a long algebra , we can write the form of the effective potential felt by charged particle with mass moving with total angular momentum @xmath49 @xmath73 where we denote the following terms @xmath74     with fixed parameters @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , for 30 contour lines in ranges r[-50,50 ] and z[-1,10].,title=\"fig : \" ]   with fixed parameters @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , for 30 contour lines in ranges r[-50,50 ] and z[-1,10].,title=\"fig : \" ]   with fixed parameters @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , for 30 contour lines in ranges r[-50,50 ] and z[-1,10].,title=\"fig : \" ]    in this situation , we do not have any considerable difference between the figures and around the origin it is possible to check the singularity and the lines away to the center .    on the other hand",
    ", we can express the effective potential directly related to energy .",
    "in doing so , we use the relations in eqs.([eq : energy ] ) , ( [ eq : angularmomentum ] ) and ( [ eq : circuprecess ] ) that give three linear differential equations , involving the four unknowns @xmath79 .",
    "it is possible to study the motion of test particles with only these relations , if we limit ourselves to the particular case of equatorial trajectories , i. e. @xmath80 .",
    "indeed , since the gravitational configuration is symmetric with respect to the equatorial plane , a particle with initial state @xmath35 and @xmath81 will remain confined to the equatorial plane which is , therefore , a geodesic plane . substituting the conserved quantities of eqs.([eq : energy ] ) and ( [ eq : angularmomentum ] ) into eq.([eq : circuprecess ] ) , we find @xmath82 where @xmath83 is an effective potential .",
    "we assume the convention that the positive value of the energy corresponds to the positivity of the solution @xmath84 .",

    "the motion of charged test particles is governed by the behavior of the effective potential in eq.([eq : effectivepot ] ) .",
    "the radius of circular orbits and the corresponding values of the energy @xmath55 and angular momentum @xmath49 are given by the extrema of the function @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , the conditions for the occurrence of circular orbits are @xmath87 thus , by calculating the condition in eq.([eq : circularconditios ] ) for the effective potential in eq.([eq : effectivepot ] ) , we find the angular momentum of the particle in circular motion @xmath88 conventionally , we can associate the plus and minus signs in the subscript of the notation @xmath89 to dextrorotation and levorotation , respectively . moreover , by inserting the value of the angular momentum in eq.([eq : circangularmomentum ] ) into the second equation of eq.([eq : circularconditios ] ) , we obtain the energy @xmath90 of the particle in a circular orbit as @xmath91 where @xmath92 ^ 2 }                              { 4 m^2 c^2 r^2    \\left(2 r \\phi_{,r } - 1\\right)^2}.                              \\label{eq : xi - general}\\ ] ] therefore , each sign of the value of the energy corresponds to two kind of motions ( dextrorotation and levorotation ) indicated in eqs.([eq : energycir ] ) and ( [ eq : xi - general ] ) by the superscripts @xmath93 .",
    "one of the most important tests of general relativity and modified theories of gravitation in astrophysical scale is the perihelion advance of celestial objects . in this section",
    ", we present the analytic expressions which determine the perihelion advance of charged test particle , moving in a conformastatic spacetime under the presence of a magnetic field . starting with the first integral in eq.([eq : circuprecess ] ) , we restrict the analysis to the motion of a particle on the plane with @xmath35 .",
    "then , we have @xmath94 ,     \\label{eq : orbit}\\ ] ] where all the quantities are evaluated at @xmath35 and we have used the expressions for the energy and angular momentum of the particle given by eqs.([eq : energy ] ) and ( [ eq : angularmomentum ] ) , respectively . with the change of variable @xmath95 , eq.([eq : orbit ] ) can be transformed into @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 \\ .",

    "we now illustrate the results by considering a particular conformastatic spacetime generated from the harmonic potential of a punctual mass @xmath102 thus , by inserting eq.([eq : upotential2 ] ) into eq.([eq : explicf ] ) we obtain for @xmath103 @xmath104}{\\left ( 1   - \\frac{q \\sqrt{g } m}{c l }   \\right)^2}.   \\label{eq : fequation}\\ ] ] accordingly , the perihelion advance of a particle in this spacetime is given by @xmath105}{\\left ( 1   - \\frac{q \\sqrt{g } m}{c l }   \\right)^2 } ,                           \\label{eq : advance1}\\ ] ] where the term @xmath106 satisfies the equation @xmath107",

    "moreover , this neutrality is essentially due to the influence of the solar wind , but a global net charge , e.g. in stars , is still on discussion @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,<,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to get a real use of eq.([eq : periheliondrift ] ) , we follow the procedure presented in @xcite .",
    "first , we rewrite both the angular momentum ( [ eq : circangularmomentum ] ) and the energy ( [ eq : energycir ] ) , which depend on the radial distance @xmath2 , in terms of the parameters that describe the orbit of rotating test particles . for the radial distance",
    ", one can use the ellipse formula in the euclidean plane as @xmath114 where @xmath17 is the semimajor axis and @xmath115 the eccentricity of the orbit .",
    "moreover , we can rewrite eq.([eq : periheliondrift ] ) by using physical units related to observations as @xmath116 where we have introduced the solar mass @xmath117 and the period @xmath118 of the rotating body .",
    "the parameter @xmath119 allows us to transform units from radians to ( secular ) degrees .",
    "moreover , in order to obtain a real effective advance @xmath120 and to alleviate the error propagation , we define a deviation formulae away from general relativity standard result @xmath121 induced by the coupled einstein - maxwell fields as @xmath122 where a dimensionless parameter",
    "@xmath123 measures the tiny variation of the orbits through time .",
    "as we have checked in the studied cases in table ( [ table1 ] ) , a variation of @xmath123 must not exceed @xmath124 of the ratio between the einstein - maxwell contribution @xmath125 and observations @xmath126 .    when applied to the observational data @xcite plus a supplementary precession corrections from epm2011 @xcite , one can test eq.([eq : periheliondrift3 ] ) .",
    "thus , we obtain the results presented in table ( [ table1 ] ) for the perihelion precession of inner planets of the solar system , two neo s asteroids named 433 eros and 3200 phaethon , and neo 2p / encke comet .",
    "the data for the astrophysics parameters of planets like semimajor axis , eccentricity , period and mass , can be found in jpl solar system dynamics ( http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?planets ) and for asteroids and comets , in jpl small body database ( http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi ) .",
    "the orbital periods are in units of years .",
    "as shown in table ( [ table1 ] ) , the theoretical results match the observations , and a slight improvement is obtained as compared to the standard einstein gravity which turns our model closer to the observations .",
    "we conclude that the gravitational interaction generated by the magnetic field of the central body can play an important role in astrophysical observations .",
    "it is worth to say that the values of @xmath71 seem to be sensitive to the variation of the eccentricity of the orbits and the mass of the object as seen in the studied cases and the values have a close resemblance to ppn parameters that have a bound @xmath127 @xcite .    in addition , some other considerations must be noted .",
    "the constant @xmath128 enters explicitly the expression for the perihelion advance in eq.([eq : circuprecess ] ) , and it represents null , time - like and space - like curves . for @xmath129 , we do not have a solution since eq.([eq : periheliondrift3 ] ) diverges . for time - like trajectories ,",
    "no physical results are obtained , because in the corresponding newtonian limit a differential equation is obtained , whose solution implies that @xmath2 is negative .",
    "moreover , no significant differences were found for different values of the charge of the order @xmath131 , which is the value where the behavior of the energy and angular momentum becomes affected by the presence of the effective charge . in the same sense , no differences could be found when using both solutions for the angular momentum @xmath132 and energy @xmath133 .",
    "in this work we have shortly shown the characteristics of the motion of a charged particle along circular orbits in a spacetime described by a conformastatic solution of the einstein - maxwell equations . as a particular example",
    "we have considered the case of a charged particle moving in the gravitational field of a punctual source placed at the origin of coordinates .",
    "our analysis is based on the study of the behavior of an effective potential that determines the position and stability properties of circular orbits .",
    "we also have investigated the behaviour of effective potentials .",
    "in addition , we have also calculated an expression for the perihelion advance of a test particle in a general magnetized conformastatic spacetime obtaining a good agreement with the observed values for the perihelion of inner solar planets and some selected neo asteroids .",
    "it is worth noting that all results presented were obtained with the initial assumption of a neutral particle , in accordance with the fact that planets are largely neutral .",
    "specifically , in the perihelion drift , we find that the differences between a neutral particle and a charged particle are sightly small , when realistic values for the effective charge are used .",
    "this means that the electromagnetic interaction between the charge and the central magnetized body does not seriously affect the value of the perihelion advance .",
    "nevertheless , the magnetic field enters explicitly the metric components and , consequently , affects the motion of neutral test particles through the gravitational interaction .",
    "this explains why the numerical predictions of the perihelion advance generated by a punctual magnetized mass are in better agreement with observations than the predictions of einstein s theory alone . as a future prospect",
    ", we will apply the poincar surface - of - section method for analyzing weakly perturbed hamiltonian conformastatic systems .",
