    "the last few years have seen growing evidence for non - vanishing neutrino rest masses in the results from neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite .",
    "however , the direct bounds on neutrino masses remain rather weak .",
    "while the electron neutrino mass is known to be smaller than about 2.2 ev @xcite , the muon neutrino mass has to be smaller than 170 kev @xcite , a bound about 5 orders of magnitude worse and still as high as 30 % of the electron mass .",
    "the situation is even worse by another two orders of magnitude for which is known from aleph to be smaller than 18.2 mev @xcite . in this paper",
    "we explore leptonic decays for improving on the bound of .",
    "in the standard model the leptonic branching ratios of are given as br ( l |_l ) = v_cs ^2 f_d_s^2 _ d_s m_d_s m^2_l f(1 - ) ^2 with @xmath1 is the corresponding ckm matrix element , @xmath2 the life - time , @xmath3 the mass of the , @xmath4 the decay constant and @xmath5 the lepton mass , and f is a phase space factor which depends on the neutrino mass ( f = 1 when neutrino mass is zero ) .",
    "several quantities cancel when the ratio of two leptonic branching ratios is taken and furthermore this ratio is quite sensitive to the mass @xcite . neglecting the muon neutrino mass to first approximation",
    ", the ratio between muonic and tauonic decays can be parametrised as a function of @xmath6 mass to first order in @xmath7 r = = r_0 ( m _ = 0 ) ( 1 - c ( ) ^2 ) @xmath8 is obtained as r_0(m_=0)=  = 9.79 @xmath9 is given by [ eq : ratio ] c = = 28.77 the values were obtained using @xmath10=1777 mev and @xmath11=1969 mev @xcite .",
    "the ratio r as a function of is plotted in fig.1 .",
    "as expected , the figure shows that the ratio decreases as the mass of @xmath12 is increased .",
    "furthermore , it follows from eq .",
    "[ eq : ratio ] that to improve the bound on down to 10 mev would correspond to a 0.1 % effect on @xmath13 only . to achieve the latter bound would be especially interesting , because it would close the window for observation of a mev majorana neutrino in double beta decay via atomic mass dependent effects@xcite .",
    "we have not yet discussed the role of radiative corrections to the ratio @xmath8 . for the case of @xmath14",
    "decays these have been carefully calculated and are well - known@xcite",
    ". a complete calculation of analogous radiative corrections for decays is yet to be done .",
    "it is expected that these corrections would be in the range of 2 to 4 % .",
    "this will modify the bound on @xmath6 mass . to extract a meaningful limit on the mass of @xmath6",
    "it will be necessary to have the radiative corrections to the value of r available .",
    "one can also compare inclusive decay rates , rather than the exclusive modes above .",
    "the ratio r _ , = is free from any dependence on energy resolution and for a point - like the expression is as given in @xcite .",
    "this gives a correction of 2.4 % in the direction of increasing the tau branching ratio . in both cases , it would be desirable to have an estimate of the remaining structure dependent corrections , although we believe that they would not be larger than the effects already included here .",
    "similar considerations can be applied to the decays of @xmath15 as well . however , the rates in that case are suppressed by the ckm suppression as well as phase space , and the branching ratios are smaller than for @xmath16 decays by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "this make @xmath15 unsuited for extracting mass limits on the tau neutrino .",
    "the current status of leptonic branching ratios of interest are compiled in tab .",
    "1 . as can be seen , all measurements still have large errors . taking the pdg values",

    "however recently there have been improvements in investigations of decays at lep .",
    "using the branching ratio values of aleph @xcite a ratio of r = 8.5 @xmath17 5.2 can be obtained , unfortunately still having a much too large an error for the purpose at hand .",
    "the situation might be improved by producing a clean and statistically large sample by looking at diffractive production in antineutrino - nucleon scattering at a neutrino factory @xcite or accurate measurements at the planned cleo - c charm factory @xcite . for the latter",
    "an accuracy on both branching ratios of 4 % is predicted .",
    "if we assume that the central values remain the same as obtained by aleph this would imply a value of r = 8.5 @xmath17 0.5 , which is significantly away from @xmath8 . the accuracy in r , of about 6 % , would be a great improvement over the current one , but still not quite at the level needed to get improved bounds on the @xmath6 mass , which calls for a level of less than 1 % .",
