    "a cool atmosphere with an extremely low metal abundance seems the best explanation for its red color .    for a surface temperature as low as that indicated by the red color of j1102 + 4113 , both pure hydrogen and pure helium model atmospheres",

    "such scaling is needed because not all the light from the object is captured by the spectroscopic fiber .",
    "the scaling is greater than the typical sdss value of 035 ( adelman - mccarthy et  al .",
    "2008 ) , probably because the fiber placement did not account for the 14 proper motion of j1102 + 4113  between the imaging and spectroscopic epochs .",
    "we first fit pure - hydrogen atmosphere models ( kowalski 2006b ; kowalski & saumon 2006 ; kowalski 2007 ) to the photometry of j1102 + 4113  ( excluding the @xmath52 band , whose uncertainties are too large to be useful ) , assuming a typical wd gravity of @xmath53 ( e.g. , fontaine , brassard , & bergeron 2001 ) . the resulting fit yields @xmath54  k. synthetic photometry from this model is shown as the blue triangles in figure [ rwdfnu3 ] .",
    "the fit is reasonable given the model uncertainties , although the formal @xmath55 is quite poor : @xmath56 for 4 degrees of freedom ( @xmath57 minus @xmath44  minus a normalization factor ) , with about @xmath975% of the @xmath55 signal coming from the discrepancy at @xmath47 .",
    "the red optical colors are produced in the far red wing of ly@xmath30 ( perturbed at high density ) , while the dips in the near - ir spectrum are due to h@xmath7@xmath40h@xmath7 collision - induced absorption ( cia ) .",
    "while j1102 + 4113  is 022 redder in @xmath58 than any pure - h model , it is an open question how well such models reproduce the relevant physics at @xmath59  k. hydrogen in the atmosphere of a @xmath59  k wd is approaching a density where nearby molecules are strongly correlated and where the refractive index is significantly greater than unity .",
    "furthermore , there are still uncertainties about the reliability of h@xmath7 cia opacities in wds .",
    "observationally , there are few wds known near that temperature with which comparisons with models can be made . at @xmath6  k",
    ", cia will affect the optical colors of wds and their @xmath58 colors will become bluer .",
    "however , given all the physical effects discussed above that may not be handled correctly in the models , it is not certain how optically red pure - h atmospheres become before they turn bluer . in short",
    ", the models could be sufficiently in error to explain the formally poor fit of the pure h model predictions to the j1102 + 4113  data .",
    "the distance to the wd in our pure - h model fit is 35 pc , making the tangential velocity @xmath60 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the cooling time to reach @xmath44=3830 k is @xmath61 gyr , assuming a typical wd mass of 0.6 @xmath62 with a core of equal parts c and o ( fontaine et  al . 2001 ) .",
    "including @xmath63 gyr for its progenitor s lifetime ( fontaine et  al .",

    "alternatively , at the same temperature , if @xmath65 ( 9.5 ) , then j1102 + 4113  would have the following approximate properties : @xmath66 ( 1.36 ) @xmath62 , @xmath67 ( 10 ) pc , @xmath68 ( 83 ) km s@xmath3 , cooling time 7 ( 3 ) gyr and progenitor lifetime @xmath69 gyr .",
    "if j1102 + 4113  has @xmath70 , then it would be at @xmath71  pc with @xmath72 and its total age would be greater than the age of the universe unless it is an unresolved double degenerate or a product of common - envelope binary star evolution ( fontaine et  al . 2001 ) .",
    "we can calculate the components of the object s space velocity relative to the sun , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which are positive in the directions of galactic center , galactic rotation , and the north galactic pole , respectively .",

    "thus , the space velocities of j1102 + 4113  are most consistent with those of the halo . however",
    ", if j1102 + 4113  is at @xmath82 pc , it could be a young , thick disk wd with an unusually ( but not unprecedentedly ) high mass .",
    "a parallax measurement is needed to discriminate between these possibilities and to pin down the mass of j1102 + 4113 .",
    "we next fit pure he models ( kowalski & saumon 2004 , 2006 ) to the data ( again assuming @xmath53 ) , but were not able to find a realistic fit .",
    "if the near - infrared photometry is omitted , a good fit is found with @xmath44=3360 k. synthetic photometry from this model is shown as the red squares in figure [ rwdfnu3 ] ; the model near - infrared fluxes greatly overpredict the observed fluxes .",
    "thus , a good fit can not be found to the combined optical and near - ir photometry of j1102 + 4113  with a pure he model : if the temperature is increased to move the peak of the fit to shorter wavelengths , the slope of the optical fit will deviate unacceptably from the observations ( see the blue lines in figure [ wd_mixed ] ) .",
    "we also consider mixed h / he models , as even a tiny amount of hydrogen in a helium - dominated atmosphere ( @xmath83 ) can induce sufficient h@xmath7@xmath40he cia to cause a significant near - infrared flux deficit ( see , e.g. , figure 5 of bergeron & leggett 2002 ) .",
    "the results of normalizing mixed h / he models with @xmath84  k to the photometry are shown in figure [ wd_mixed ] ; for slightly higher or lower @xmath44  ( @xmath81500  k ) the overall results are similar . none of the mixed h / he models yield a better match to the data than the pure hydrogen model , although a model with @xmath85 fits at wavelengths @xmath86 microns .",
    "in summary , the poor fit of pure - he models to the photometry means that there is certainly hydrogen in the atmosphere of this wd .",
    "however , the h / he ratio can not be pinned down with current models , due to uncertainties in how accurately the models treat the complicated physics involved ( refraction , non - ideal equation of state , non - ideal chemistry , perturbed lyman series absorption , etc .",
    "; see kowalski 2006a ) .",
    "both h / he@xmath871 and h / he@xmath881 are possible .",

    "<S> that temperature and gravity would place this white dwarf at 35 pc from the sun with a tangential velocity of 290 km s@xmath3 and space velocities consistent with halo membership ; furthermore , its combined main sequence and white dwarf cooling age would be @xmath411 gyr . </S>",

    "<S> whatever its origin , the optical colors of this object are redder than predicted by any current pure hydrogen , pure helium or mixed hydrogen - helium atmospheric model , indicating that there remain problems in our understanding of the complicated physics of the dense atmospheres of cool white dwarfs . </S>"
