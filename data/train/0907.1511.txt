    "over the past ten years , there has been a huge amount of research into theories with large extra dimensions @xcite , where the standard model matter fields are confined to a four - dimensional hyper - surface ( or _ brane _ ) , with only gravitational degrees of freedom permitted to propagate in the higher - dimensional bulk .",
    "one consequence of these theories is that the fundamental energy scale of quantum gravity , @xmath9 , is related to the four - dimensional planck energy @xmath10 by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the size and number of extra dimensions respectively .",
    "this means that @xmath9 may be as small as @xmath14(tev ) , raising the exciting prospect of observing quantum gravity effects in the near future ( see the reviews @xcite for details and references ) .    amongst quantum gravity processes ,",
    "the potential to create higher - dimensional black holes in trans - planckian particle collisions at the lhc has attracted intense interest in the literature .",
    "it is anticipated that such mini black holes will evaporate very quickly , due to hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the evaporation of higher - dimensional mini black holes is modelled in terms of four stages : the so - called ` balding ' , ` spin - down ' , ` schwarzschild ' , and ` planck ' phases @xcite . of these ,",
    "the ` schwarzschild ' phase is the simplest to study and the hawking emission during this phase has been analyzed in depth by a number of authors , using both analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite techniques .    the ` spin - down ' phase of the evolution has received considerable attention recently @xcite .",
    "a complete analysis of the ` spin - down ' phase is lacking because the graviton emission has yet to be fully modelled ( see @xcite for work in this direction ) , leaving open the question of whether the idea that `` black holes radiate mainly on the brane '' @xcite is valid for this phase of the evolution ( see @xcite for some papers discussing this issue ) .",
    "the effect of including the ` spin - down ' phase in simulations of black hole events at the lhc has recently been examined in detail @xcite ( for an earlier work , see @xcite ) .",
    "it is found that , even if the black hole loses a substantial amount of angular momentum during the ` balding ' phase , the ` spin - down ' phase makes a significant difference to the properties of black hole events , which can not be adequately approximated by the isotropic evaporation of the ` schwarzschild ' phase .",
    "another key finding of @xcite is that the ` spin - down ' phase is not , as previously thought , short - lived compared with the ` schwarzschild ' phase ( in fact , it is not possible to fully distinguish a separate ` schwarzschild ' phase , with the rotation of the black hole being significant for most of its lifetime ) .",
    "the significance of the ` spin - down ' phase complicates black hole events at the lhc @xcite , making their detection more challenging .",
    "it also means that measuring all the parameters describing a particular black hole event is likely to be very difficult .",
    "our purpose in this letter is to investigate a key difference in the evaporation during the ` spin - down ' phase compared with the ` schwarzschild ' phase , namely the non - isotropy of the emission .",
    "we are seeking aspects of the anisotropic emission which are particularly sensitive to the parameters describing the higher - dimensional black hole , with the intention that this will aid the development of detection and measurement strategies using full monte - carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec - theory ] , we briefly review the mathematical description of the higher - dimensional rotating black hole and hawking radiation from it . in section [ sec - profile ]",
    "we consider the emission , on the brane , of positive and negative helicity spin-1/2 and spin-1 particles .",
    "we focus on the angular distribution of the emitted energy by these particles , and how this depends on the energies of the individual emitted particles , the angular momentum of the black hole , and the number of extra dimensions . finally , in section [ sec - conclusions ] , we present our conclusions , making some remarks on the prospects of using our results to determine some of the properties of rotating higher - dimensional black holes at the lhc .",
    "the gravitational field around a ( @xmath15)-dimensional uncharged rotating black hole is described by the well - known myers - perry solution @xcite .",
    "the projected line - element follows by fixing the values of the additional angular coordinates describing the extra space - like dimensions @xcite .",
    "then , the gravitational field on the brane takes the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 we have also assumed that the black hole metric has only one non - zero angular momentum component , in a plane parallel to the brane , as we are interested in black holes created by the collision of particles on the brane .",
    "the mass @xmath18 of the black hole and its angular momentum @xmath19 are then proportional to @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , @xmath22 where @xmath23 $ ] is the area of an @xmath24-dimensional unit sphere , and @xmath25 is the @xmath26-dimensional newton s constant . by demanding that the impact parameter between the colliding particles is small enough for a black hole to be created , an upper bound can be imposed on the angular momentum parameter @xmath27 as follows : we have @xmath28 @xcite , where @xmath29 .",
    "the radius of the black hole s event horizon @xmath30 is the largest , positive root of @xmath31 , and , for @xmath32 , there is only one such root in the region @xmath33 , which may be implicitly written as @xmath34 .",
    "the four - dimensional background ( [ metric ] ) is the one felt by the brane - localized standard model fields and thus the one that should be used for the derivation of the field equations for scalars , fermions and gauge bosons . by using the newman - penrose formalism and generalizing teukolsky s four - dimensional analysis @xcite",
    ", one may derive a ` master ' partial differential equation for the field perturbation @xmath35 on the brane @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath36 is the helicity , or spin - weight , @xmath37 , that we use to distinguish the radiative components of the spin-@xmath38 field .",
    "the brane ` master ' equation for the particular background ( [ metric ] ) turns out to be separable - by using a factorized ansatz for the field perturbation expressed as a fourier mode series @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the fourier coefficients , we write @xmath41 to denote the set of ` quantum numbers ' of each mode , and @xmath42 are the spin - weighted spheroidal harmonics , the ` master ' equation leads to two decoupled ordinary differential equations , namely @xmath43 { } _ hr_\\lambda , \\label{radial}\\ ] ] and @xmath44 { } _ hs_\\lambda(x ) \\ , .",
    "% \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{angular}\\ ] ] in the above , we have defined the quantities @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the constant of separation between the radial and angular equations .",
    "the black - hole background ( [ metric ] ) emits elementary particles on the brane in the form of hawking radiation with temperature @xmath48 in this letter , we focus on the power emission rate , that may be expressed in two forms : in terms of unit time and energy and integrated over all angles @xmath49 @xmath50 or in terms of unit time , frequency and angle of emission , @xmath51 in the above expressions , @xmath52 and @xmath53 is a statistics factor for fermions and bosons , respectively .",
    "the extra factor @xmath54 in the emission rates for gauge bosons comes from the two linearly independent polarization states of the spin-1 field . finally , the quantity @xmath55 is the transmission probability , defined as the flux of energy transmitted down the event horizon over the incident flux of energy on the black hole ",
    "it is this quantity that modifies the form of the radiation spectra of a black hole from the purely thermal one of a black body . for details of the derivation and computation of the emission rates ( [ power - int ] , [ power - ang ] ) , including the numerical techniques used in solving the differential equations ( [ radial ] , [ angular ] ) , we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the emission rates for scalars , fermions and gauge bosons were studied in detail . amongst the results in those papers",
    ", it was found that the emitted power was significantly enhanced with both @xmath13 and @xmath56 - the enhancement factor for all species of particles was of order @xmath57 as @xmath13 changed from 1 to 6 , and of order @xmath58 as @xmath56 increased from zero towards its maximum value @xmath59 .",
    "the differential emission rate per unit time , frequency and angle of emission ( [ power - ang ] ) was also studied .",
    "the angular variation in the spectra was characterized by two main features : in the low - energy regime , the spin - rotation coupling for fermions and gauge bosons caused the polarization of the emitted radiation in directions nearly parallel to the rotation axis ; as either the angular momentum of the black hole and/or the energy of the emitted particle increased , this feature receded and the centrifugal force caused the concentration of the emitted radiation , for all species of particles , on the equatorial plane , i.e. transversely to the rotation axis of the black hole .",
    "in this section , we will investigate further the angular profile of the emitted radiation on our brane from a higher - dimensional black hole by focusing on the emission of individual helicity modes .",
    "we will therefore consider only the emission of brane - localized fermions and gauge bosons , and ignore henceforth the single - component scalar fields . in each case",
    ", the energy flux for positive helicity particles is obtained from ( [ power - ang ] ) by including only the term with @xmath60 ; similarly the energy flux for negative helicity particles is obtained from the @xmath61 term in ( [ power - ang ] ) @xcite .    the study of the differential emission rate ( [ power - ang ] ) for spin-1/2 and spin-1 particles of ref .",
    "@xcite considered only the ` total ' emission , i.e. the sum of the emission of both helicity modes in each case .",
    "the spin - weighted spheroidal harmonics satisfy the property ( after an overall choice of sign ) @xmath62 as a result , the sum of the squared values of the spin - weighted spheroidal harmonics for the two helicities @xmath63 is bound to be symmetric under the change @xmath64 , and the plots showing the angular variation in the ` total ' emission are symmetric in the two hemispheres",
    ". however , it is clear that the emission of single - helicity modes is not going to have the same property , and it is this additional variation in the angular distribution that we investigate here . with a similar motivation ,",
    "certain aspects of the angular distribution of the emission spectra of spin-1/2 particles were studied also in @xcite .    [ cols= \"",
    "< , < , < \" , ]     thus far we have not considered the role the number of extra dimensions plays in this angular distribution . in the case of the ` total ' emission rates , where the contribution from both helicity modes was considered , the dependence on @xmath56 and @xmath13 was also very prominent , however , as both parameters caused the same effect in the spectra , namely their enhancement , it was impossible to distinguish their role . in fig .",
    "[ n ] , we present a set of plots of the energy emissivity of the black hole integrated over the frequency @xmath65 , in terms of the emitted angle for three different values of the angular momentum parameter ( @xmath66 ) , and for three different values of the number of extra dimensions ( @xmath67 ) in each case . the purpose is to investigate the dependence of the _ shape _ of the curves on @xmath13 , rather than the magnitude of the emission .",
    "to this end , we rescale our data so that the peak of the emission curve for the sum of the two helicity modes is at unity at @xmath68 with the rescaled integrated emissivity curves for each helicity mode shown below .    the spin-1 profiles in fig .",
    "[ n ] vary more than the spin-1/2 profiles as the number of extra dimensions , @xmath13 , changes , but none of the profiles change a great deal except in the spin-1 case when the angular momentum of the black hole is comparatively small ( @xmath69 ) . from this",
    "we conclude that the angular distribution of emitted particles is not a good indicator of the number of extra dimensions .",
    "however , this also means that the angle - dependent spectra carry a strong dependence only on the angular momentum parameter , and this opens the way for the determination of @xmath56 . from fig .",
    "[ n ] , we see that the profiles of the individual helicity particles are more sharply peaked for spin-1 compared with spin-1/2 particles , at the same value of @xmath70 , but , interestingly , the total power emission ( summing over the two helicities ) has a broader shape in the spin-1 case compared with the spin-1/2 case , for all values of @xmath70 .",
    "the authors of @xcite also studied the angular distribution of the flux of negative helicity fermions , but for a particular value of the frequency @xmath71 .",
    "[ 3d ] confirms , for all frequencies in the power flux , their observation for the fermion particle flux that there is an asymmetry in the emission in helicity - dependent states , which becomes more strongly peaked as the angular - momentum parameter @xmath70 increases . from fig .",
    "[ n ] , it can also be seen that the asymmetry in the power flux decreases as the number of extra dimensions @xmath13 increases , which was found to be the case for the fermion particle flux at a particular frequency in @xcite .",
    "the possibility of creating higher - dimensional black holes at the lhc and subsequently observing their hawking radiation is one of the most exciting consequences of models with large extra dimensions .",
    "the recent inclusion of black hole angular momentum in simulations of such black hole events @xcite , as well as improving the accuracy of the simulations , has also indicated that black hole rotation is likely to have major consequences for the detection of hawking radiation .",
    "this is particularly true for the emission , on the brane , of particles with non - zero spin , which , in practice , are the main particles which will be detected should black holes be formed at the lhc .",
    "the primary consequence of including black hole rotation is that the hawking emission is no longer isotropic @xcite . in this letter",
    "we have examined further the nature of this anisotropy for particles of spin-1/2 and spin-1 , considering separately the positive and negative helicity states , to determine whether any features of the anisotropic emission could , at least in principle , be used to derive information about the evaporating black hole or the higher - dimensional space - time .",
    "there are three main space - time parameters which it would be desirable to probe in black hole events : the number of extra dimensions @xmath13 , the size of the extra dimensions @xmath12 , and the energy scale of quantum gravity @xmath9",
    ". these will be the same for all black hole events , so a large number of events can be used in their determination . in addition , one would be interested , for individual black hole events , in measuring the mass @xmath72 and angular momentum @xmath19 of the black hole when it is first formed ( or , equivalently , @xmath73 and @xmath70 ) .",
    "the question of how to extract information about these parameters from the hawking radiation is still not completely resolved . for rotating black holes ,",
    "since increasing either @xmath13 or @xmath70 increases the hawking flux , disentangling this degeneracy in the values of @xmath13 and @xmath70 from , for example , the numbers of emitted particles , may be difficult . in this paper",
    ", we have found that , for both fermion and gauge boson emission , the shape of the angular distribution of total energy emission for both positive and negative helicity particles depends only weakly on the number of extra dimensions @xmath13 , for all values of the black hole angular momentum parameter @xmath70 .",
    "this means that the shape can not be used to measure the value of @xmath13 , with only the magnitude of the power emitted depending strongly on its value . on the other hand ,",
    "the angular distribution of energy emission for both species of particles was found to depend strongly on @xmath70 and can therefore be used as a good indicator of the angular momentum of the produced black hole . by measuring @xmath70 for many black hole events , it would be possible to build up a distribution of @xmath74",
    ".    another interesting measurement would be the direction of the axis of rotation of the black hole .",
    "rotating black holes preferentially emit spin-1 particles over fermions ( with approximately an order - of - magnitude greater energy emission ) and low - energy spin-1 particles are emitted almost entirely in directions nearly parallel to the axis of rotation , particularly for smaller values of @xmath13 .",
    "on the other hand , the fermion energy emission is strongly peaked on the equatorial plane , providing complementary evidence for the direction of the axis of rotation @xcite .",
    "measuring particles of a specific helicity further refines this measurement by effectively indicating the ` arrow ' of the black hole angular velocity vector along this axis .    in our study of the physics of hawking emission from higher - dimensional black holes ,",
    "we have taken the usual semi - classical approach of calculating the emission from a fixed black hole geometry .",
    "this does not model the evolution of the black hole during the evaporation process , with the black hole losing mass and angular momentum .",
    "it is also anticipated that the black hole will recoil as it emits particles @xcite , due to momentum conservation , and that the axis of rotation may well change direction .",
    "every particle emitted , observed or unobserved , changes the mass and angular velocity of the black hole . in practice ,",
    "the process is stochastic and hence each black hole decay is unique . nevertheless ,",
    "by combining the spectra of semi - classical theory with monte carlo methods ( as in @xcite ) , one may model the likely ` ensemble ' of black hole decays .",
    "this approach will be crucial for determining whether the physics effects we have described in this paper will be detectable in real data and for devising detection strategies .",
