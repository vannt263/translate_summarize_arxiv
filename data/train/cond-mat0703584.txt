    "prompted by considerable technological interests , the physics of itinerant electrons coupled to spin - orbit ( so ) potentials has been the subject of extensive investigations in recent years.@xcite in materials of interest , the main sources of so coupling are the rashba interaction arising from structural inversion asymmetries of low - dimensional structures,@xcite and the dresselhaus interaction present in bulk crystals lacking inversion symmetry.@xcite depending on the material characteristics , one of the above interactions , or even both , may be present , lifting the spin degeneracy of the electron dispersion . when measured at the fermi level , the resulting energy splitting , @xmath1 ,",

    "we show that , even for weak or moderate couplings to phonons , the effective reduction of the bare dos induced by the rashba interaction leads to a strong increase of @xmath10 , and to phonon satellite peaks in the interacting dos , which are typical signatures of an effectively strong el - ph coupling . due to the two - dimensionality of our model , and to the rashba type of so coupling , our results could be relevant for both metal and semimetal surface states , for which the el - ph interaction has been shown to be relevant,@xcite and for surface superconductors,@xcite with the hypothesis that pairing is provided by the coupling to phonons .",

    "this is the quantity which is usually used to quantify the so strength in semiconductors such as gaas and inas .    for @xmath13",
    "the situation is drastically different . in this case in fact , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , the fermi level crosses only the @xmath51 band but , since @xmath52 has a minimum at @xmath53 , the fermi surface is still constituted by two concentric circles . the resulting fermi sea is therefore given by the area of the annulus comprised by the two circles and in the limit of @xmath54 , with @xmath55 , the fermi surface @xmath56 coalesces into a circle of radius @xmath33 , @xmath57 , while the fermi velocity @xmath48 vanishes as @xmath58 . since @xmath59 ,",

    "let us introduce now the coupling to the phononic degrees of freedom . in the present paper , we consider the following holstein - type of interaction hamiltonian @xmath61 where @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for a phonon with momentum @xmath64",

    "the present analysis is therefore a starting point for more general formulations of the el - ph hamiltonian .",
    "the thermal green s function of the electrons subjected to the total hamiltonian @xmath67 satisfies the following dyson equation @xmath68^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is a fermionic matsubara frequency and @xmath70 is the temperature .",
    "@xmath71 is the non - interacting electron propagator and @xmath72 is the self - energy due to the coupling with phonons . due to the so interaction appearing in @xmath73 , these quantities are @xmath74 matrices in the spin sub - space . from eqs .",

    ", we shall consider a self - consistent born approximation ( non - crossing approximation ) which neglects all el - ph vertex corrections .",
    "furthermore , we shall not consider many - body corrections to the phonon propagator .",
    "these limitations will be discussed in sec.[disc ] and , for the moment , it suffices to keep in mind that this approximation scheme should be not too poor as long as the coupling to the phonons is sufficiently weak .",
    "hence , given the phonon propagator @xmath79 the resulting electron self - energy matrix in the non - crossing approximation reduces to : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the el - ph coupling constant . from eq.([self3 ] ) it is clear that , due to the momentum independence of the el - ph interaction , the self - energy ( [ self3 ] ) depends only upon the frequency .",
    "furthermore , by substituting @xmath82 for @xmath83 in eq.([self3 ] ) , the resulting second - order self - energy is diagonal in the spin space .",
    "this holds true for all orders of iteration , so that @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the unit matrix . the green s function ( [ self1 ] )",
    "can therefore be rewritten as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the electron propagator in the chiral basis for the interacting case while the self - energy is @xmath88 where @xmath89 in the above expression , we have introduced an upper momentum cut - off @xmath90 which prevents the integral over @xmath91 from diverging .",
    "such divergence is an artifact due to the use of a momentum independent el - ph matrix element @xmath66 in eq.([ham2 ] ) and of the electron gas model of @xmath73 . on physical grounds ,",
    "the introduction of @xmath90 is equivalent therefore to defining a finite brillouin zone of area @xmath92 or , equivalently , a finite bandwidth @xmath93 when @xmath94 .",
    "in the following , @xmath95 will be chosen to be much larger than the other relevant energy scales of the system ( @xmath96 , @xmath29 , @xmath9 ) .",
    "a finite @xmath90 , or @xmath95 , permits also to define a finite electron density @xmath97 which , relative to the cut - off @xmath90 , becomes @xmath98 where @xmath99 is an infinitesimal positive quantity and the second equality has been obtained by using @xmath100.@xcite in the following , we shall present results in terms of the electron number density @xmath101 which attains the limiting value @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) for completely filled ( empty ) bands .    before turning to the next sections , where we present our numerical results ,",
    "it is worthwhile showing how the so effects on the dos enter the self - energy function . by transforming the integration over @xmath91 in an integration over the energy , eq.([self7 ] ) can be rewritten as follows : @xmath104 where , for simplicity , terms of order @xmath105 have been omitted in the upper limit of integration , and @xmath106 is the reduced non - interacting dos obtained from eqs.([dos1 ] ) and ( [ dos2 ] ) . from the above expressions , it is therefore straightforward to realize the importance on the el - ph properties of the square root singularity of the dos at low energies . as we shall see in the following , the effective electron mass and the electron spectral properties in the presence of",
    "so interaction will differ qualitatively from the corresponding results for @xmath94 .",
    "as a function of the bare chemical potential @xmath78 for @xmath107 and several values of the so interaction @xmath29 .",

    "hence , for fixed values of @xmath112 , @xmath65 and @xmath29 , the electron self - energy @xmath113 is obtained by iteration of eqs.([self5 ] ) , ( [ self6 ] ) , and ( [ self7 ] ) , while eq.([enne1 ] ) is used to extract the corresponding electron density for a given value of @xmath78 . for all cases",

    "this energy decrease represents the ground state energy of a single electron in interaction with phonons and provides a measure of the strength of the el - ph interaction . for non - zero so coupling , @xmath117",
    ", two features are apparent in fig .",
    "first , in the low density limit , @xmath110 is no longer a linear function of @xmath78 and , second , the ground state energy @xmath118 is even more lowered with respect to the @xmath94 case .",
    "this latter feature indicates that , for fixed @xmath112 , a single electron is more strongly coupled to phonons as @xmath29 increases .     as a function of the electron density number @xmath110 for @xmath107 and for several values of the so interaction @xmath29 . ]    a more quantitative estimation of the role of so coupling on the el - ph properties is given by the electron effective mass enhancement @xmath0 .",
    "this quantity can be evaluated from @xmath119 provided sufficiently low temperatures are considered .",
    "we have checked that for @xmath108 the effective mass ratio extracted from eq .",

    "[ fig3 ] we report our results for @xmath0 as a function of the electron number density @xmath110 for the same parameter values of fig . [ fig2 ] .",
    "for @xmath94 we obtain the typical trend for a 2d electron gas in the non - crossing approximation : @xmath0 is almost a constant and approximately equal to the migdal - eliashberg result @xmath120 for relatively large densities while , for @xmath121 , @xmath0 decreases towards the one electron result.@xcite for @xmath122 , the mass enhancement follows the @xmath94 case for densities larger than @xmath123 , corresponding to the range of densities for which @xmath110 is proportional to @xmath78 ( see fig .",

    "in this section we review the meaning of the approximations used in the present work and discuss alternative models for the study of the el - ph interaction in strong rashba so systems .",
    "let us start by considering the limitations of the non - crossing approximation for the electron self - energy . for zero so interaction , or for fermi energies sufficiently larger than @xmath29 ,",

    "however , as we have seen , for non - zero so interaction the electrons behave as effectively strongly coupled to the phonons when the fermi level is below @xmath29 .",
    "this is because of the square - root singularity in the dos when @xmath55 . in the @xmath163 regime , therefore , the non - crossing approximation , although making evident the trend towards strong coupling , may not be adequate for a more trustworthy description of the system .",
    "it is instructive at this point to consider the limiting situation where only one electron is present . by using second - order perturbation theory (",
    "that is simply the non - crossing approximation with the bare electron green s function ) it is easy to evaluate the mass enhancement factor . at zero temperature , and setting for simplicity @xmath164 , this is given by @xmath165 it is clear from the above expression that for @xmath166 the mass enhancement factor is governed by an effective coupling , say @xmath167 , proportional to @xmath168 , amplified with respect to @xmath112 by the square - root divergent dos .",
    "equation ( [ 2pt ] ) clarifies also that the relevant adiabatic parameter for @xmath169 is @xmath170 , rather than @xmath171 ( where @xmath95 plays the role of the bandwidth ) , and that the effective coupling @xmath167 increases as @xmath172 .",
    "consequently , in the adiabatic limit @xmath173 perturbation theory breaks down for any finite @xmath112 because @xmath174 .",
    "this leads us to suspect that , in analogy with the adiabatic limit of the one - dimensional lattice holstein model,@xcite the ground state of a single electron for @xmath173 is always a bound polaron .",

    "it is possible to interpret the coupling to the phonons in terms of an effective el - ph coupling @xmath167 which grows as @xmath29 increases .",
    "for example , in the range of electron densities @xmath126-@xmath179 , the mass enhancement factor plotted in fig .",

    "indeed , provided that @xmath183 , the effective coupling turns out to be of order @xmath184 , where the square - root term stems from the singularity of the dos , eq.([dos ] ) , in analogy with the general definition of the effective el - ph interaction in the presence of a van hove singularity.@xcite at this point it is possible to estimate the validity of the self - consistent non - crossing approximation for the self - energy considered in the previous sections .",
    "in fact , according to migdal s theorem generalized to systems with diverging dos,@xcite the el - ph vertex correction factors beyond the non - crossing approximation are at least of order @xmath185 , so that neglecting them would introduce an error of order @xmath186 .",
    "estimates of @xmath186 for the different cases discussed in this paper can be obtained by evaluating @xmath187 from fig.[fig3 ] . in this way the fermi energy is roughly given by @xmath188 , which then can be inserted in the definition of @xmath186 .",
    "for the low density value @xmath126 we find @xmath189 for @xmath150 and @xmath190 for @xmath149 , showing that the non - crossing approximation is quantitatively inaccurate in this case .",

    "let us turn now to discuss the general form of the self - energy for the case in which the el - ph matrix element is momentum dependent . here",
    "we consider the situation in which the momentum dependence is only through the modulus @xmath194 of the momentum transfer @xmath64 , as is the case , for example , with the 2d frhlich model , for which the coupling goes like @xmath195 .",
    "as shown in the appendix , a fully general expression of the self - energy valid also beyond the non - crossing approximation is : @xmath196 where @xmath197 and @xmath198 are scalars . compared to eq.([self6 ] ) , the above expression has an additional term which is off - diagonal in the spin subspace , renormalizing therefore the so coupling .",
    "this term disappears ( @xmath199 ) only when the el - ph matrix element is momentum independent , like in the holstein model , and at the same time the self - energy is evaluated in the non - crossing approximation . in all other cases , like , _",
    "e.g. _ , the frhlich model in the non - crossing approximation , @xmath198 is nonzero . for sufficiently large values of @xmath200 such that the weak so limit @xmath201 holds true",
    "so that the fermi level lies far above the 1d singularity of the dos , @xmath198 turns out to be of order @xmath202 , and can be disregarded in comparison with @xmath203 . on the contrary ,",
    "when @xmath204 , @xmath197 and @xmath198 have comparable magnitude , and the full momentum and frequency dependent of both terms must be considered for a consistent evaluation of the el - ph effects .",
    "in this paper we have addressed the role of the rashba so interaction in the properties of a coupled el - ph gas in two dimensions . by using a self - consistent non - crossing approximation for the electron self - energy ,",
    "we have studied the mass enhancement factor and the spectral properties .",
    "we have shown that , for sufficiently strong so interaction , the electron becomes strongly coupled to the phonons even if el - ph coupling @xmath112 can be classified as weak .",
    "we identify this behavior as being due to a topological change of the fermi surface for strong so interaction , which gives rise to a square - root singularity in the dos at low energies .",
    "signatures of such effectively strong el - ph coupling are found in the mass enhancement factor , which becomes as large as @xmath205 for el - ph coupling of only @xmath107 , and in the energy dependence of the interacting dos , displaying low energy peaks separated by multiples of the phonon energy @xmath65 .",
    "this latter feature could be tested experimentally by tunneling or photoemission experiments in systems where the fermi level can be tuned to approach the square - root singularity of the dos .",
    "we have then discussed limitations of the non - crossing approximation approach and possible generalizations of the theory for momentum - dependent el - ph matrix elements . since the problem of el - ph coupling in the presence of so interaction is relevant for several systems such as metal and semimetal surface states , surface superconductors , or low - dimensional heterostructures , and given the current interest in spintronic physics",
    ", we hope that our work will stimulate further investigations .      in this appendix",
    "we evaluate the form of the electron self - energy when the el - ph interaction is momentum dependent .",
    "in particular , we consider the hamiltonian @xmath206 , where @xmath73 is the rashba spin - orbit hamiltonian of eq.([ham ] ) and @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the el - ph matrix element which we assume depends only on the modulus of momentum transfer @xmath64 .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite @xmath209 in terms of the eigenvectors of @xmath73 , whose annihilation operators @xmath210 ( @xmath32 ) are related to @xmath211 through @xmath212 where @xmath213 is the azimuthal angle of @xmath23 . in this basis , @xmath73 is diagonal with dispersion relation given by eq.([energy2 ] ) while @xmath214 becomes @xmath215 with @xmath216 by applying wick s theorem , it turns out that , to all orders of the el - ph interaction , the green s function in the chiral basis has zero off - diagonal components so that , if @xmath217 , the matrix green s function in the original spin sub - space becomes @xmath218 consequently , by using dyson s equation ( [ self1 ] ) , the matrix self - energy in the spin sub - space is @xmath219 where @xmath220 in order to obtain eq.([selfq ] ) , it suffices to demonstrate that the momentum dependence of self - energy in the chiral basis , @xmath221 , is only via @xmath31 .",
    "this is accomplished by noticing that the el - ph matrix element in the chiral basis , eq.([app4 ] ) , depends on the direction of the momentum transfer @xmath222 solely through @xmath223 .",
    "hence , if the electronic dispersion depends only on the modulus of the momentum , as is the case with eq.([energy2 ] ) , a general self - energy diagram in the chiral basis will be independent of the direction of @xmath23 which , by using ( [ app7 ] ) , is consistent with eq.([selfq ] ) ."
