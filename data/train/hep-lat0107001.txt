    "the anisotropic lattice is drawing more attention as a useful technique of the lattice qcd simulation in various physics such as the spectroscopy of exotic states , finite temperature qcd and the heavy quark physics .",
    "however , the advantage of having a fine lattice spacing in the temporal direction is obtained at the sacrifice of manifest temporal - spatial axis - interchange symmetry .",
    "therefore improper use of the anisotropic lattice could lead to an unphysical result due to the lack of lorentz symmetry in the continuum limit .",
    "this can be a serious problem for those physics in which the precision of the results is crucial .",
    "one way to avoid this problem is to tune the anisotropy parameters of the action by imposing the conditions with which the lorentz invariance is satisfied for some physical observables . in the wilson plaquette gauge action",
    "there is only one anisotropic parameter in the action @xcite .",
    "wilson loops are used to obtain the relation between the anisotropic parameter and the physical ratio of the lattice spacings in temporal and spatial directions , @xmath9 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the spatial and the temporal lattice spacings @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "not much is known about the quark action .",
    "this is because the previous works with the quark action on the anisotropic lattice have been devoted to the charmonium systems @xcite . in order to apply the anisotropic lattice to the systems containing the light quarks",
    ", one has to study how one can tune the parameter of light quark action in practical simulations .",
    "in this paper we study the @xmath0 improved wilson action on the anisotropic lattice using the quenched lattices with three lattice spacings , at fixed renormalized anisotropy , @xmath10 .",
    "these scales covers the range of the spatial lattice cutoff @xmath1112 gev .",
    "we first tune the bare anisotropy in the quark action numerically so that the renormalized fermionic anisotropy is equal to that of the gauge field by imposing the relativistic dispersion relation of mesons .",
    "this calibration is performed to the level of 1 % statistical accuracy in whole quark mass region below the charm quark mass .",
    "the extrapolation of tuned bare anisotropy to the chiral limit is performed by fitting to presumable forms , and causes additional systematic uncertainty of 1 % at the chiral limit .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in the calibration from the lattice artifact is estimated by comparing the results from different types of dispersion relations .",
    "it results in 3 % on our coarsest lattice , and tends to vanish in the continuum limit . using the result of the calibration we compute the light hadron spectrum on anisotropic lattices , and examine how the uncertainty in the calibration affect the spectrum at the parameters of physical interest .",
    "it is found that the uncertainty of 2 % in calibration induces systematic error of 1 % in the spectrum .",
    "thus the systematic uncertainty on the anisotropic lattice is under control , as well as the statistical one .",
    "we also show that the anisotropic lattices produce consistent results with those on the isotropic lattices , and that the lorentz invariance of the simple matrix element is satisfied within errors .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section describes the @xmath0 improved wilson quark action , which has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the calibration procedures are discussed in section  [ sec : calibration ] . in section  [ sec",
    ": numerical ] , we perform the calibration of the bare anisotropy in the quark action . the systematic uncertainty induced by this tuning",
    "is fully examined . in section [ sec : spectroscopy ] we apply the anisotropic lattice to the light hadron spectroscopy . in the last part of this section , the systematic uncertainty due to the anisotropy is again investigated in terms of the effect on hadron spectrum . the last section is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "we employ the @xmath0 improved quark action on the anisotropic lattice .",
    "the form of action has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is the same as the fermilab action @xcite but defined on the anisotropic lattice . in this section we summarize the result which will be necessary in the following calculations .",

    "the tadpole - improvement @xcite is achieved by rescaling the link variable as @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this is equivalent to redefine the hopping parameters with the tadpole - improved ones ( with tilde ) through @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we define the anisotropy parameter @xmath6 as @xmath27 at the tadpole - improved tree - level , and for sufficiently small quark mass , the anisotropy @xmath6 coincides with the cutoff anisotropy @xmath9 .    in this work , we set the coefficients of the spatial part of the wilson term and the clover coefficients as the tadpole - improved tree - level values , namely , @xmath28 and perform a nonperturbative calibration only for @xmath6 with the meson dispersion relation .",
    "it is useful to define @xmath29 @xmath30 so that the bare quark mass in the spatial lattice unit , @xmath31 , is expressed as @xmath32 which is analogous to the case of the isotropic lattice .      in this subsection",
    ", we examine the dispersion relation of the free quark on the anisotropic lattice .",
    "first the tree - level relation of bare anisotropy with @xmath33 is derived from the condition that the rest mass and the kinetic mass coincide .",
    "then , we discuss how the dispersion relation is distorted at the edge of brillouin zone due to our choice , @xmath34 @xcite .    from the action ( [ eq : action ] ) , the free quark propagator satisfies the dispersion relation @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the bare quark mass in the temporal lattice unit . setting @xmath39 , eq .",

    "one can tune the bare anisotropy parameter @xmath6 so that it gives the same values for the rest and the kinetic masses @xcite .",

    "\\label{eq : gamma_f_in_m_0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath42 dependence starts with the quadratic term for @xmath34 , therefore the dependence on the quark mass is small for sufficiently small @xmath42 .",
    "for example , let us consider the case of @xmath45 gev , which corresponds to our coarsest lattice in the simulation .",
    "the charm quark mass corresponds to @xmath46 and at this value @xmath6 is different from @xmath33 only 3 % .",
    "up to this quark mass region , one can expect that the difference of @xmath6 from @xmath33 is also small in the numerical simulation .",
    "this is examined in section  [ sec : numerical ] .    with our choice of wilson parameter , @xmath34",
    ", the action ( [ eq : action ] ) leads the smaller spatial wilson term for the larger cutoff anisotropy @xmath33 .",
    "the question is how the contribution of the doubler eliminated by the wilson term becomes significant for practical value of @xmath33 . in the following argument on this subject",
    ", we only treat the case @xmath6 almost equal to @xmath33 , i.e. the region of @xmath42 sufficiently smaller than unity .",
    "figure  [ fig : dispersion ] shows the dispersion relation ( [ eq : dispersion ] ) for several values of @xmath42 in the case of @xmath10 , which we use in the numerical simulation .",
    "let us examine the practical case , @xmath47 gev , which corresponds to the lowest spatial cutoff of our three lattices .",
    "for the light quark mass region , @xmath48@xmath49 corresponds to 80200 mev , and roughly covers the mass region which we use in the hadron spectroscopy in section  [ sec : spectroscopy ] .",
    "@xmath50 rapidly decrease at the edge of the brillouin zone , and the height at @xmath51 is around 400 mev . for two quarks with momenta @xmath52 , additional energy of doublers",
    "is @xmath53 mev , and is expected to affect not severely on the spectrum and other observables . for higher lattice cutoff ,",
    "the situation becomes better .",
    "then we regard the doubler contribution is sufficiently small on the lattice we use in the simulation .",
    "@xmath54 roughly corresponds to the charm quark mass with @xmath55 gev . in the case of heavy - light hadrons , such as @xmath56 mesons and @xmath57 baryon ,",
    "the scale of momentum transfered inside hadrons is of the order of @xmath58 , and the same argument for light quark case holds .",
    "on the other hand , for the heavy quarkonium , the typical energy and momentum exchanged inside the meson are in the order of @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively @xcite . for the charmonium , @xmath61 ,",
    "then typical scale of the kinetic energy is around @xmath62 mev .",
    "it seems not sufficiently smaller than the two doublers contribution , and hence one need to choose larger lattice cutoff in the calculation of heavy quarkonium .",
    "on anisotropic lattice , one must tune the parameters so that the anisotropy of quark field , @xmath63 , equals to that of the gauge field , @xmath64 : @xmath65 since @xmath64 and @xmath63 are in general functions of both of gauge parameters ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) and quark parameters , ( @xmath29 , @xmath6 ) , the simulation with dynamical quarks requires to tune these bare parameters simultaneously . in the quenched case , however , this tuning is rather easy to be performed , since @xmath64 can be determined independently of @xmath6 . after the determination of @xmath33 , one can tune @xmath6 so that a certain observable satisfies the condition ( [ eq : xi ] ) . in this work , we use the relativistic dispersion relation of meson , @xmath68 as our main calibration procedure .",

    "@xmath71 , this condition satisfies that the rest mass and the kinetic mass equal to each other . for finite lattice spacings , above dispersion relation only holds up to the @xmath72 correction term . in the continuum limit",
    ", this higher order term in @xmath73 would vanish and the relativistic dispersion relation would be restored .    in the numerical simulation , we fit @xmath74 to the form eq .",
    "( [ eq : dr1 ] ) and obtain the value of @xmath63 for each input value of bare anisotropy @xmath6 .",
    "then we linearly interpolate @xmath63 in terms of @xmath6 and find out @xmath75 , the value of @xmath6 with which @xmath71 holds .    in order to estimate the systematic errors we also use the dispersion relation which corresponds to the lattice klein - gordon action @xcite , @xmath76 thus the comparison of these two calibration conditions",
    "typically shows the size of the lattice discretization errors .    expanding this expression in @xmath73 ,",
    "@xmath77 is related to @xmath63 as @xmath78 the same input @xmath6 gives smaller value for @xmath77 than @xmath63 , and therefore the tuned bare anisotropy @xmath79 results in larger value in the former case .",
    "the goal of this section is to determine the tuned bare anisotropy of quark field , @xmath75 , at each fixed quark mass in the region from strange to charm quark masses .",
    "the reason for this choice of the quark mass range is that the simulation is easier which saves the amount of work in the exhaustive study for calibrations .",
    "fitting the result as a function of the quark mass , we obtain @xmath75 to the statistical accuracy of 1 % level for the whole quark mass region below the charm quark mass including the chiral limit .",
    "then we estimate the systematic uncertainties of @xmath75 which are mainly due to @xmath80 and @xmath20 lattice artifacts .",
    "we also investigate how these systematic errors as well as the statistical error affect the meson masses , in the region @xmath81 .",
    "the response of hadron masses with respect to @xmath6 in the light quark mass region , @xmath82 , needs additional care , and is the subject of next section . at the end of this section",
