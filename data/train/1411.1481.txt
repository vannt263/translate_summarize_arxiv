    "it is almost 90 years since the peculiar behavior in the radial velocity curve of eclipsing binaries during eclipse was discovered by the pioneering studies of rossiter ( 1924 ) ( for @xmath12  lyr ) and mclaughlin ( 1924 ) ( for @xmath12 per ) .",
    "they called this phenomenon as the `` rotational effect , '' since it is caused by the combination of two factors that ( 1 ) the visible part of the stellar disk changes during the course of eclipse , and ( 2 ) each point of the disk has its own line - of - sight velocity due to stellar rotation .",
    "more specifically , in a typical eclipsing binary system where the rotation and orbital motion are in the same direction , this effect may be briefly described as follows : velocity ) is zero . ]",
    "+  ( i ) at the ingress phase , the radial velocity ( starting from net - zero when all disk is visible ) is generally positive and systematically increases until the maximum value is attained just before the mid - eclipse , since the relative contribution of the receding limb ( where the line - of - sight velocity is maximum ) becomes more important as the obscured fraction of remaining part of the disk progressively increases .",
    "+  ( ii ) at the egress phase of eclipse , on the contrary , starting from the most negative value ( caused by the approaching limb just re - appeared after mid - eclipse ) , the net ( negative ) radial velocity again gradually increases with time as the visible fraction of remaining part of the disk progressively increases , until it eventually ends with net - zero when the whole disk is visible .",
    "+  ( iii ) at the mid - eclipse near the light minimum between ( i ) and ( ii ) , a conspicuous `` leap '' is observed , since the radial velocity abruptly changes its sign here from positive to negative .",
    "this effect , which is occasionally called as `` rossiter  mclaughlin effect '' ( hereinafter referred to as `` r  m effect '' ) after the discoverers , recently received hot attention of astronomers especially in connection with observations of transiting planets , since it can be applied to diagnose the properties ( e.g. , rotational velocity , axis of rotation , etc . ) of not only the host star but also the planetary system ( see , e.g. , ohta et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "yet , when it comes to eclipsing binaries belonging to the field of stellar physics , studying the properties of the eclipsed component by actively utilizing the r ",
    "m effect seems to have been rarely tried so far , despite its conceptual potentiality ( e.g. , kallrath & milone 2009 ) .",
    "is this effect practically applicable to investigating the rotational features ( e.g. , rotational velocity , degree of differential rotation , etc . ) of eclipsing binaries by analyzing the observed radial - velocity curve during the phase of eclipse ?",
    "we recently came to an idea of examining this possibility by making use of the unusual occultation phenomenon timely occurred in the exclusively well studied and most familiar star , our sun , since a deep ( even if partial ) solar eclipse by the moon took place in the morning of 2012 may 21 at okayama astrophysical observatory , where sufficient experiences of precise radial velocity determinations by using the 188  cm reflector+ hides spectrograph have been accumulated over more than 10 years thanks to the long - continuing `` okayama planet search program '' targeting evolved g  k giants ( e.g. , sato et al .",
    "this situation motivated us to challenge a new spectroscopic study on this occasion .",
    "thus , following our research plan of this line , we first obtained the observed radial velocity curve of `` the sun as a star '' during the course of the eclipse by using hides , and then analyzed it to get information on the solar rotational properties as much as possible .",
    "the comparison of such obtained results with the actual solar parameters ( which we already know very well ) would make an interesting and valuable touchstone for discussing the possibility and the prospect of the r  m effect mentioned above .",
    "the purpose of this article is to report the consequence of this experiment .",

    "m effect based on their high - precision radial - velocity observations of integrated sunlight reflected by the moon during the venus passage on 2012 june 6 . while this study is similar to theirs ( though the transiting object is not venus but the moon in our case ) , our aim is different in the sense that it is not only to detect the r ",
    "m effect but also to extract therefrom as much information of solar rotation as possible .",

    "that is , the bare end of the optical fiber was directly exposed to the solar radiation , so that the collected light was further sent to hides ( high dispersion echelle spectrograph ) via the fiber link system ( kambe et al .",
    "the fov ( field of view ) of our observation is a circle area with angular diameter of @xmath24  deg ( corresponding to 0.21 str ; see the explanation below ) centered on the sun .",

    "this reduced the fiber modal noise considerably as well as decreasing the sunlights by less than one thousandth . *",
    "the fov of the diffusor was restricted to about @xmath26  str by the vacuum vessel s window , which allowed to keep monitoring the whole sun disk under somewhat poor guiding while considerably limiting the scattered light coming directly from the sky . *",
    "a hole of the filter box ( or more exactly , in an alminum plate just after the vaccum vessel of the iodine cell ) with diameter of 17  mm worked as an entrance aperture to the fiber .",
    "this assures that the f - ratio of the incident light ( f/3.8 ) is close to that of our normal observations with the telescope and the fiber system .",
    "* these fiber - entrace components were put on a portable equatorial telescope mount ( vixen gp.d ) for automatically tracking the sun .",
    "practically , as we did not have sufficient time to set up the telescope mount properly between the end of the regular night observing run and the solar eclipse , we had to compensate the tracking error manually from time to time .",
    "for this purpose , we put pinhole and target plates on the same mount , which were separated by about 200  mm with their axes being aligned to the fiber input end beforehand .",
    "we guided the sun so that the solar image on the target plate did not move by more than 15 arcmin . at the output end of the optical fiber ( i.e. , at the entrace of the spectrograph )",
    ", a microlens was used to convert the f - ratio of the incident light to that of the spectrograph ( f/29 ) , and then an image slicer was placed to keep a moderate wavelength resolving power .",
    "this optics is identical to that of our hides fiber - link ( kambe et al . 2013 ) . in this way",
    ", we could obtain spectra almost equivalent to those of the sun seen as a star ( solar flux spectra ) .",
    "although the observations were done over the time span of @xmath1  hours ( jd  2456068.352456068.51 or 5:209:20 jst ) covering the eclipse , the sky condition was not always desirable , especially before / around the beginning of eclipse where the observations were often disturbed due to clouds .",
    "just after the eclipse began ( from @xmath16  jd 2456068.4 ) , however , the condition was significantly improved ; since then , we could conduct our observations almost continuously and satisfactorily ( even if thin cirrus passed by sometimes ) .",
    "consequently , we could obtain 184 spectra ( with i@xmath27 lines imposed mainly at @xmath16  50006000  @xmath28 ) covering 44007500  @xmath28 with three mosaicked ccds ) with a wavelength resolving power of @xmath29 .",
    "the exposure time for each spectrum frame was set to @xmath30  s in most cases ( while the overhead time for ccd readout was @xmath31  s ) .",
    "the reduction of the spectra ( bias subtraction , scattered - light correction , aperture determination , flat - field correction , spectrum extraction , wavelength calibration , continuum normalization , etc . ) was carried out by using the echelle package of iraf .. the typical signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) of the finally resulting spectra are @xmath16 400500 ( between minimum @xmath32 and maximum @xmath33 ) , as estimated from photon counts at @xmath34  @xmath28 . as an example , we show in figure 4 one of our typical spectra ( taken at just outside of the eclipse ) in two wavelength regions of 53355375  @xmath28 ( conspicuous i@xmath27 lines ) and 66856725  @xmath28 ( absence of i@xmath27 lines )    as we can see from figure 4 , our hides spectrum appears similar to kurucz et al.s ( 1984 ) solar flux spectrum , except that lines in our spectrum are slightly shallower because of the difference in the resolving power . as a more quantitative check , we measured the equivalent widths [ @xmath35(oao ) ] of @xmath36 ( almost blend - free ) fe  i and fe  ii lines on our spectrum in @xmath16  62007400  @xmath28 , and compared with those @xmath35(kpno ) measured from kurucz s ( 1984 ) kpno spectrum atlas , which were already published in takeda et al .",
    "( 2005 ; cf .",
    "table  e1 therein ) .",
    "we found a fairly good correlation between @xmath35(oao ) and @xmath35(kpno ) , as represented by a linear regression relation of @xmath35(oao ) = 0.963 @xmath35(kpno ) + 1.59 ( where @xmath35 is measured in m@xmath28 ) with a correlation coefficient of @xmath37 .",
    "accordingly , our spectrum may be regarded practically as that of the sunlight integrated over the disk .",
    "the radial velocity of the sun - as - a - star for each frame was derived from the spectrum of @xmath16  50006000  @xmath28 region ( where many reference lines of i@xmath27 molecules are manifestly imprinted ) basically following the standard procedure ( e.g. , sato et al .",
    "2002 ) , while using the sky spectrum taken on 2012 january 17 as the template spectrum .-",
    "cell technique , only the differential radial velocity of the spectrum is obtained relative to an arbitrarily adopted template spectrum . in this sense , only their time variations are of significance , while the absolute values themselves do not have much meaning . ] the spectrum of the relevant wavelength range was divided into segments of several  @xmath28 , and @xmath38 ( radial velocity relative to the template ) was determined for each segment @xmath39 ( @xmath39 = 1 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) .",
    "then , the radial velocity of the sun - as - a - star relative to that of the template ( @xmath42 ) and its probable error ( @xmath43 ) were computed by averaging these @xmath38 over the segments as follows : @xmath44 and @xmath45    the actually used segments for computing the final result and its error with equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) were carefully chosen by excluding those showing large deviation from the main trend ; and the number of finally adopted segments was @xmath46 ( about half of the total ) .    here ,",
    "given that only relative time variations are relevant in the present study ( cf .",
    "footnote 6 ) , we can add any constant to @xmath42 ( relative velocity in reference to the template ) . actually , these @xmath42 values ( i.e. , velocity differenes between jan .",
    "17 and may 21 ) turned out to be rather large , which may be ascribed either to the large time span between observed dates or to some systematic effect because the template spectrum was obtained in the normal mode of hides using the 188  cm telescope ( i.e. , different optical system from that used in this study ) .",
    "since the time average of @xmath42 over the whole period is @xmath47  km  s@xmath6 , we apply an offset by this amount and hereafter use @xmath48  km  s@xmath6 ) as the formal observed radial velocity , which is convenient because @xmath49 outside the eclipse takes values nearly zero .",
    "the resulting radial velocities @xmath49 are presented in electronic table  e ( tablee.dat ) for all spectra , and how they varied during the course of eclipse is displayed in figure 5 , where the related quantities such as s / n and @xmath43 are also shown .",
    "it is evident from figure 5d that the variation of @xmath49 has a characteristic shape of the r ",
    "m effect ( though the sense of change is contrary to what was explained in section 1 , since the occultation began from the side of the receding limb in this case ) .    regarding the error involved in @xmath49",
    ", we can see from figure 5c that @xmath43 is between @xmath50  m  s@xmath6 and @xmath30  m  s@xmath6 , which is about twice as large as that we have normally accomplished for similar s / n in our planet search observations .",
    "we also note a correlation between @xmath43 and s / n in the sense that @xmath43 tends to increase at s / n  @xmath51 ( cf .",
    "figure 6 ) . since",
    "such cases of comparatively lower s / n correspond to the phases of dimmed sunlight ( before the eclipse disturbed by clouds , or near to the mid - eclipse ; cf .",
    "figure 5 ) , we speculate that differences between the actually observed integrated spectrum and the adopted template sky spectrum may be responsible for this tendency of somewhat larger @xmath43 ( i.e. , intrinsic changes of line profiles must have occurred because light contributions from various parts of the disk were inhomogeously integrated in such cases ) . at any event , @xmath43 does not have any significant influence  jd 2456068.372456068.38 ) is not due to errors in @xmath49 .",
    "this is most probably due to the fact that lights from various parts of the solar disk were inhomogeneously / irregularly contributed in the integrated observed flux , since clumpy clouds were incessantly passing through in front of the sun at this period . ] on the essential behavior of @xmath49 , as we can see in figure 5d where the error bars are hardly recognized .",
    "this observed @xmath49 curve will be compared with the simulated theoretical @xmath52 in section 4 , the computational details for which are described in the next section 3 .",
    "we assume that the sidereal angular rotational velocity of the sun ( @xmath53 ) depends on the heliographic latitude ( @xmath3 ) as @xmath54 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( in deg  day@xmath6 ) are the parameters corresponding to the equatorial rotation velocity and the degree of differential rotation , respectively . )",
    "is often applied ( see , e.g. , takeda & ueno 2011 ) . here",
    ", we decided to adopt the former simpler one . ]    since @xmath55@xmath56 cartesian coordinate system is defined on the solar disk in such a way that @xmath56 axis is aligned with the rotational axis ( cf .",
    "figure 7 ) , the following relation between @xmath3 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 holds ( @xmath57 is the solar radius ) : @xmath58    then , as the line - of - sight velocity due to solar rotation @xmath59 at @xmath60 is expressed as @xmath61 we can calculate @xmath59 at any point on the solar disk with the help of equations ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 5 ) , if @xmath62 are specified .",
    "this @xmath63 ( in the heliocentric system ) is then corrected by subtracting the heliocentric correction @xmath64 due to earth s motion ( not only disk - position - dependent but also time - dependent ; computed by following the procedure described in subsection 4.1 of takeda & ueno 2011 ) was evaluated by using the `` rvcorrect '' task of iraf , while taking into account ( i ) the rotation of the earth ( diurnal velocity ) , ( ii ) the motion of the earth s center about the earth ",
    "moon barycenter ( lunar velocity ) , and ( iii ) the motion of the earth ",
    "moon barycenter about the center of the sun ( annual velocity ) .",
    "practically , the heliocentric correction @xmath64 ( for the observation at time @xmath65 on the disk point @xmath66 ) was computed at the coordinate ( @xmath67 ) on the celestial sphere , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( the disk - center position of the sun ) were obtained by interpolating the solar ephemeris table .",
    "note that this @xmath64 can not be simply represented by the disk - center value of @xmath70 , since it significaltly depends on the position of the solar disk . ] to obtain the topocentric value @xmath71 corresponding to our observation at okayama : @xmath72 consequently , @xmath52 ( simulated radial velocity of the eclipsed sun ) is evaluated by averaging @xmath71 over @xmath73 ( visible part of the solar disk ) while weighting it according to the brightness at each disk point : @xmath74 where the numerical integration was performed by dividing the solar disk into 36000 ( @xmath75 : with steps of 1@xmath13 and 0.01@xmath57 ) tiny sections ( figure 7 ) . regarding the disk brightness @xmath76 ,",
    "we adopted a linear limb - darkening relation : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the specific intensity at the disk center , @xmath25 is the direction cosine ( @xmath79 ) , and @xmath43 is the limb - darkening coefficient assumed to be 0.7 ( corresponding to @xmath80 and @xmath81  50006000  @xmath28 ; cf .",
    "fig . 17.6 in gray 2005 ) .",
    "by @xmath82 on the radial velocity curve , and found that the resulting variation was practically negligible ( i.e. , @xmath16  67  m  s@xmath6 at most ) . ]    in this way , we could compute @xmath52 at any phase of eclipse for various combinations of @xmath62 .",
    "several examples of @xmath83 curves are depicted in figure 8a ( changing @xmath8 while @xmath9 is fixed at 0 ) and figure 8b ( changing @xmath9 while @xmath8 is fixed at 14.0 ) .",
    "we are now ready to extract information of ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) by comparing @xmath52 with @xmath49 . for this purpose ,",
    "we first computed 441 radial velocity curves @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ; @xmath86 is the number of available spectra for each of the observing times ) , resulting from combinations of 21 @xmath8 values ( from 12.0 to 16.0 with a step of 0.2 ) and 21 @xmath9 values ( from @xmath87 to + 5.0 with a step of 0.5 ) .",

    "this situation is illustrated in figure 9 , where we can see that the surface of @xmath94 is like an elongated trough , in which pinpointing @xmath62 corresponding to @xmath88-minimum is hardly possible .",
    "actually , this is attributed to the fact that both @xmath8 and @xmath9 influence on the radial velocity curve in a similar manner .",
    "that is , as manifested in figure 8 , the effect of increasing @xmath8 ( for a fixed @xmath9 ) is qualitatively the same as that of increasing @xmath9 ( for a fixed @xmath8 ) , which means that an increase of @xmath9 can be compensated by an appropriate decrease of @xmath8 without causing any appreciable change in the shape of @xmath83 .",
    "this is the reason for the difficulty of establishing @xmath62 from the radial - velocity alone .",
    "nevertheless , we can at least state that any combination of @xmath62 satisfying the equation @xmath95 gives the overall best - fit between @xmath83 and @xmath96 , as shown in the contour diagram of figure 9 .",
    "then , how is this relation compared with the real @xmath62 values known for the sun ? according to seven representative studies ( ward 1966 ; godoli & mazzucconi 1979 ; balthasar & whl 1980 ; arvalo et al . 1982 ; howard 1984 ; balthasar et al .",
    "1986 ; sivaraman et al .",
    "1993 ) where the solar differential rotation was investigated based on the sunspot - tracing method , the resulting @xmath62 [ in the definition of equation ( 3 ) ] they determined were in good agreement with each other ( cf . figure 12 of takeda & ueno 2011 ) , which give @xmath97 and @xmath98 on the average ( the value with @xmath99 in the parenthesis is the standard deviation ) .",
    "interestingly , these empirical values are remarkably consistent with equation ( 11 ) , since it yields @xmath100 for @xmath101 . actually , we can confirm in figure 10 that the @xmath52 curve computed for @xmath102 satisfactorily matches our @xmath49 data .",
    "is somewhat insufficient at the velocity minimum of jd  2456068.43 .",
    "since the fit is more satisfactory for the second half of observation after the mid - eclipse , we suspect that the conditions before and after the mid - eclipse was not strictly symmetrical .",
    "it is interesting to note that a similar asymmetric tendency is observed in the comparison of theoretical and observed line - width described in the appendix .",
    "accordingly , we interpret that this difference of @xmath103 in @xmath0 before and after mid - eclipse ( worse for the former and better for the latter ) was caused because the crescent part being visible just before mid - eclipse happened to include some unusual region ( presumably related to active phenomena ) which could not be properly treated by our simple modeling . in any event , since the solution is essentially determined by the latter half period after mid - eclipse where the fit is remarkably good , this slight @xmath103 inconsistency just before mid - eclipse does not cause any serious problem . ]      as we have shown above , we could successfully derive the realistic relation between @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( describing the nature of solar rotation ) based on the radial velocity data of the sun - as - a - star ( showing the typical r  m effect ) alone , which were obtained during the 2012 may 21 solar eclipse , though separate determinations of @xmath8 and @xmath9 were not possible .",
    "then , how is the prospect of applying the r ",
    "m effect for studying the rotational properties of eclipsing binaries ?",
    "first , we would point out that useful information on the equatorial rotation velocity ( @xmath104 ) can be obtained by using the r ",
    "m effect even if the nature of differential rotation is unknown , since the latter effect on the radial velocity curve is quantitatively less significant ( e.g. , compare figure 8b with figure 8a ) .",
    "let us suppose in the present case that @xmath9 is unknown and we had to assume the rigid rotation ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "then , we would obtain @xmath106 from equation ( 11 ) , which differs from the true @xmath8 value only by @xmath107 .",
    "alternatively , it may be reasonable to assume @xmath108 ( solar case ) for analyzing the r ",
    "m effect of general eclipsing binaries , which would not cause any serious error , since the differential rotation parameter of a ",
    "f stars studied by ammler - von eiff and reiners ( 2012 ) ( which they call @xmath23 , being equivalent to @xmath109 ) ranges from @xmath110 to @xmath111 . considering that spectroscopic determination of @xmath112 ( though @xmath39 is often known and near @xmath113 for eclipsing binaries ) with a precision of @xmath114 based on spectral line profiles is very difficult ( especially for double - line binaries where spectral lines of both components are blended and spectra are appreciably time - variable ) , @xmath104 determination by utilizing the r ",
    "m effect would be valuable from the viewpoint of its accuracy .",
    "on the other hand , we expect it much more difficult to get information on the differential rotation based on the r ",
    "m effect alone .",
    "of course , determination of @xmath9 might be possible if @xmath8 ( or equatorial rotation velocity ) is precisely known in advance based on some other independent way , which however does not seem easy in general cases .",
    "rather , we consider that this r  m effect may be useful to `` check '' the detailed rotational features established by other more sophisticated method such as the magnetic doppler imaging ( making use of the spectrum variation caused by stellar rotation and starspots ) based on high - dispersion spectro - polarimetry ( e.g. , donati & collier cameron 1997 ; collier cameron & donati 2002 ) .    here , we should recall that many eclipsing binaries ( especially close of binaries of shorter periods ) are tidally locked , so that the rotation and orbital motion are synchronized .",
    "if this is already known firmly , it may not be much meaningful to determine the rotational velocity or the differential parameter in an independent way .",
    "yet , the accomplishment of co - rotation is not necessarily evident in general cases , especially for the case of young binaries , for which direct confirmation of the rotational parameters based on the r ",
    "m effect should still be meaningful .",
    "for example , in case where the tidal synchronization is realized , we should obtain @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "it would thus make the most definite evidence for the existence of co - rotation to confirm these two conditions .",
    "finally , it should be kept in mind that an r ",
    "m effect analysis such as done in this study presupposes an availability of observational data satisfying rather high requirements ( a series of many high dispersion spectra with sufficiently high s / n ratios , which have to be obtained in sufficiently high time resolution ) , since the time - variable radial velocity at each eclipse phase should be determined precisely .",
    "considering that many interesting eclipsing binaries are comparatively faint ( and that the integrated star light appreciably gets dimmer during the eclipse ) , these demands may appear somewhat too severe . yet",
    ", such observations would become practically feasible when observing times of large 810  m class telescopes equipped with high - speed spectrometers are flexibly available .",

    "as a supplementary analysis to our radial velocity study , we also examined based on our observational data how the width of a spectral line varies during the eclipse and whether it can be reproduced by theoretical simulations .",
    "since we want to measure the line width influenced by the doppler motion due to solar rotation , the spectral line should neither be too strong ( to avoid large intrinsic width such as the case of a saturated line ) nor too weak ( to allow a sufficiently precise measurement ) .",
    "considering these requirements , we selected the fe  i line at 6703.568  @xmath28 ( @xmath117 = 2.76  ev ) for this purpose , which is in the wavelength region almost unaffected by i@xmath27 lines ( cf .",

    "gray 2005 ) as well as the gaussian instrumental profile corresponding to @xmath29 , and finally integrated over the visible disk to get the final profile . in this computation",
    ", we adopted an adjusted ( astrophysical ) @xmath124 value of @xmath125 ; that is , kurucz and bell s ( 1995 ) original @xmath124 of @xmath126 was increased by + 0.26  dex , so that the observed line strength can be reproduced for the solar fe abundance of @xmath127 .",
    "regarding the macroturbulence parameters , we assumed @xmath128  km  s@xmath6 and @xmath129  km  s@xmath6 by consulting figure 2 of takeda ( 1995 ) , while considering that the mean - forming depth of this line is @xmath130 .",
    "as to the combination of @xmath62 , three representative cases satisfying equation ( 11 ) were simulated : ( 13.0 , + 5.5 ) , ( 14.0 , 0.0 ) , and ( 15.0 , @xmath131 ) .",
    "we then calculated the fwhms for each of the resulting theoretical profiles corresponding to various eclipse phases , which are to be compared with the observed fwhms directly measured from our 184 spectra .",
    "such comparisons are displayed in figure 11a , where we can see that the line width shows a variation with the following characteristics : +  at the ingress phase , it first decreases gradually until attaining a minimum width around @xmath16  jd  245668.42 where only the approaching east limb is visible ( near to the minimum @xmath0 ) .",
    "+  then it turns to grow as the receding west limb begins to reappear , and eventually shows a maximum sharp peak at the mid - eclipse ( at jd  245668.44 ) where both of the approaching east limb and the receding west limb are equally visible .",
    "+  after that , in the egress phase , the width decreases abruptly and again becomes minimum around @xmath16  jd  245668.46 when only the receding west limb is visible ( near to the maximum @xmath0 ) , then begins to gradually increase toward the eclipse end .",
    "it is immediately noticed from figure 11a that the mutual differences between the fwhm curves computed for three @xmath62 combinations are very subtle and hardly discernible .",
    "thus the situation is quite the same as the case of the radial velocity , meaning that separate determinations of @xmath62 based on the fwhm analysis are not possible .    according to the comparison shown in this figure , our observed fwhm data surely exhibit such an expected qualitative tendency , though not necessarily satisfactory in the quantitative sense .",
    "especially , the deviation is appreciable at the phases before the mid eclipse ( jd  2456068.42456068.3 ) , while a more or less tolerable consistency is observed after the mid - eclipse .",
    "it is interesting that this asymmetric situation is somewhat similar to the case of figure 10 as mentioned in subsection 4.2 ( footnote 12 ) .",
    "we also point out that the line depth is expected to become slightly larger at the mid - eclipse compared to the value outside of the eclipse according to our calculation , which does not observed in our spectra ( cf .",
    "figure 11b ) .",
    "this may imply that our line - profile modeling needs to be further improved if much better fitting is to be pursued .",
