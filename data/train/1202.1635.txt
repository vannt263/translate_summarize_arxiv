    "many natural phenomena can be modelized by means of a family of differential equations and each one can be put ( maybe after some manipulations ) in the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 are local coordinates in an open neighborhood of the point @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is an @xmath9-dimensional manifold , @xmath10 are the coordinates of tangent vectors in the open neighborhood of the point @xmath11 and @xmath12 is a real valued function whose domain is an open of @xmath13 .    under the assumption of @xmath12 being locally lipschitzian , an initial condition @xmath14 uniquely determines a maximal solution @xmath15 .",
    "however , the domain of @xmath15 does not need to be the whole real line @xmath16 , but only an open interval , @xmath17 , which depends on the initial condition .",
    "all the solutions give a local flow @xmath18 , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is an open subset of @xmath21 containing @xmath22 and if we denote @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath6 satisfies @xmath25 , @xmath26 , wherever it makes sense .",
    "the space @xmath8 is called the phase space and @xmath6 is also called the phase map .",

    "we note that when a trajectory has more than one point , a natural orientation is induced by the canonical orientation of the real numbers @xmath16 .",
    "then , we can consider @xmath8 as a disjoint union of critical trajectories and oriented trajectories to obtain a phase portrait of the dynamical system @xmath6 .",
    "it is well known that ( under some assumptions , see @xcite ) if @xmath28 is a local flow on @xmath8 , then there exists a global ( @xmath29 ) flow @xmath6 in @xmath8 such that the oriented trajectories of @xmath28 and @xmath6 coincide .",
    "consequently their phase portraits are the same . as a consequence of this type of result",
    "we have considered convenient to reduce our study to the case of global flows .",
    "this allows us a functorial approach to the study of dynamical systems and their properties .    on the other side , for every topological space @xmath3 , a continuous action",
    "@xmath30 induces a group homomorphism @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the group of homeomorphisms of @xmath3 provided with the compact - open topology .",
    "this allows us to study a flow as a particular case of a transformation group .",
    "the pioneering work of h. poincar @xcite in the late xix century studied the topological properties of solutions of autonomous ordinary differential equations .",
    "we can also mention the work of a. m. lyapunov @xcite who developed his theory of stability of a motion ( solution ) of a system of @xmath33 first order ordinary differential equations . while much of poincar s work analyzed the global properties of the system",
    ", lyapunov s work looks at the local stability of a dynamical system .",
    "the theory of dynamical systems reached a great development with the work of g.d .",
    "birkhoff @xcite , who may be considered as the founder of this theory .",
    "he established two main lines in the study of dynamical systems : the topological theory and the ergodic theory .",
    "previously , the authors have developed some results on proper homotopy theory and exterior homotopy theory to classify non - compact spaces and to study the shape of a compact metric space . in this paper , we describe some basic ideas that permit a new treatment of the study of dynamical system . the main objective proposed by the authors is to describe functorially a way of using exterior spaces to study dynamical systems . in our approach , the main key to establish a connection between exterior spaces and dynamical systems is the notion of absorbing open region ( or @xmath34-exterior subset ) .",
    "given a flow on space @xmath3 , an open set @xmath35 is said to be @xmath34-exterior if for every @xmath36 there is @xmath37 such that @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "the space @xmath3 together with the family of @xmath34-exterior open subsets is an exterior space which is denoted by @xmath40 .    on the one hand , using exterior spaces , we construct two limit subflows @xmath0 and @xmath1 associated with a flow @xmath3 .",
    "one of the important results of our study ( see corollary [ reticulo ] ) is the following :    _ if @xmath3 is a locally compact @xmath41 space , then @xmath42 and @xmath43 ; furthermore we have that _",
    "@xmath44 where @xmath45 is the subflow of periodic points , @xmath46 is the subflow of right ( positive ) poisson stable points and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 is the right limit set of the point @xmath49 ) . under the condition of being @xmath34-regular at infinity",
    "( see proposition [ eleigualbarele ] ) , we have that @xmath50 and in some cases we can also ensure that @xmath1 is compact . the constructions @xmath51 induce classifications ( for flows ) of the following type : two flows @xmath52 are said to be @xmath53-equivalent if there is a flow morphism @xmath54 such that @xmath55 is a homotopy equivalence .",
    "this will determine equivalence classes of flows having , for instance , the same number of critical points or the ` same type ' of periodic trajectories .",
    "on the other hand , using again exterior spaces , we construct ` slightly different ' end spaces @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , which agree when @xmath3 is locally path - connected and @xmath60-regular at infinity . in this case , the end spaces have a pro - discrete topology ( with additional conditions , a pro - finite topology ) .",
    "the importance of this end space is that each right semi - trajectory of the flow has an end point in this space .",
    "this fact allows one to give a set map @xmath61 and the corresponding @xmath62-decomposition of the flow @xmath63 in general , there will be end points which are not reached by right semi - trajectories and end points of semi - trajectories that are not reached by right semi - trajectories contained in the limit subflow . in this paper , we give sufficient conditions to ensure that an end point can be reached by right semi - trajectories of @xmath64 ( see proposition [ erepresentableuno ] ) .",
    "these end spaces will be used ( not in this work ) to construct completions ( compactification under some topological and dynamical conditions ) of a flow .",
    "these completions are related to freundenthal compactifications @xcite and will permit us to apply some nice properties of compact flows to a more general class of topological flows .    it is important to observe that applying the results of this paper to the reversed flow we will obtain all the corresponding dual concepts , constructions and properties .",
