    "more interestingly , coupled cavities have been thought of as a conduit to transfer and engineer entanglement between distant atomic qubits @xcite , which would be required for distributed quantum computing .",

    "the strength of the coupling between the cavities is characterized by the parameter @xmath6 .",
    "the magnitude of this parameter is related to the hopping strength of photons to hop between the cavities .",

    "the magnitude of this interaction strength between the @xmath2-mode and the classical driving field is given by the parameter @xmath8 which incorporates the effects of the active medium and the external pumping .",
    "a similar approach is adopted to explain the maser action which includes many external modes@xcite .",
    "the external classical field affects entanglement as it delivers energy into the pumped cavity which supports the @xmath2-mode",

    "firstly , the dynamics in the absence of the external pumping is studied .",
    "these results are useful to understand the effects of pumping .",
    "the hamiltonian to study the dynamics in the absence of external driving corresponds to setting @xmath9 in @xmath10 . in that case , the hamiltonian evolution is easily obtained since the commutator @xmath11 $ ] vanishes .",

    "this type of hamiltonian is known in other contexts such as the symmetric beam splitter@xcite , the parametric conversion in a medium with oscillatory dielectric constant@xcite and has recently been used to examine intrinsic phase coherence in a laser@xcite .",
    "the bilinear coupling @xmath14 , between the modes can not entangle them during evolution if both the modes are in classical states initially@xcite ; for instance , the @xmath2-mode in a coherent state and the @xmath5-mode in vacuum state . to generate an entangled state from a product state , during evolution in the presence of bilinear coupling , at least one of the modes has to be in a nonclassical state .",
    "so , it is meaningful to assume the initial state of the cavities to be a number state .",

    "the universal measure of entanglement for bipartite pure states@xcite is the von neumann entropy @xmath35 defined as s=- , where tr stands for trace and @xmath36 is the reduced density matrix for the @xmath2-mode field .",

    "therefore , @xmath45 equals @xmath46 whenever @xmath31 is an odd multiple of @xmath32 .",
    "the reason for the increase in the entanglement as the total number of photons increases is readily inferred from the expression for entropy @xmath35 given after eq.[rdm ] .",

    "there are @xmath49 terms in the expression for @xmath35 and the maximum @xmath35 is @xmath50 which increases with @xmath19 .",
    "the evanescent coupling allows photons to hop from one cavity to the other .",
    "this allows a redistribution of energy between the cavities .",
    "since the @xmath2-mode is subjected to external pumping , the energy of the pump field is fed to the @xmath2-mode which , in turn , is used to energize the @xmath5-field .",

    "it is reasonable to assume the function to be linear in @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "classically , this amounts to an interaction proportional to the product of the field strength of the @xmath2- mode and the amplitude of the driving field .",

    "this is understandable as large pumping leads to large energy input .",
    "since @xmath75 is sufficient enough for energy transfer between the modes , both the modes will have more number of fock states in their superposition .",
    "hence , a large entanglement is possible . if @xmath65 , a representative value for small @xmath6 , the coupling is not good enough for the energy to flow from the @xmath2-mode .",
    "thus , the @xmath5-mode will have fewer number of fock states in the superposition .",

    "strong coupling between the modes reduces the effect of the driving - field fluctuations on the entanglement .",
    "as stressed earlier , sufficient coupling between the cavities allows for efficient flow of energy and the maximum value of @xmath29 during evolution is also large .",
    "it is , therefore , possible to choose the cavity - cavity coupling so that the effects of fluctuations are minimized . in other words ,",
    "smaller coupling between the cavities necessitates a more stable pumping .",
    "two coupled cavities generate entangled , bipartite , non - gaussian states . in the absence of external pumping , the cavities exchange energy periodically .",

    "the covariance criterion of entanglement is insensitive to the driving amplitude if the driving is linear .",
    "however , with quadratic pumping , the states occurring during the evolution are such that the covariance criterion identifies entanglement . if the couping between cavities is weak , increasing the driving field amplitude decreases the peak entanglement attainable during evolution compared to the pump - free evolution . therefore , it is important to tailor the pumping strength to match the cavity - cavity coupling . during evolution ,",
    "maximum entanglement between the fields in the cavities occurs when the mean number of photons in the two cavities are equal . + for weak coupling between the cavities , the maximum attainable entanglement decreases rapidly as the pumping strength is increased .",

    "this is because of preferential increase in the energy of the pumped cavity leading to large difference in the mean number of photons of the two cavities . on the other hand ,",
    "if the coupling between the cavities is stronger , the maximum entanglement attained during evolution increases for larger range of values of the pumping strength . also , the change of entanglement with pumping strength is not as rapid as the change if the coupling between the cavities is weak .",
