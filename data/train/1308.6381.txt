    "effective forces arising between two surfaces confining a fluid close to its critical point , known in the literature as critical casimir forces @xmath3 @xcite , have been studied theoretically and experimentally for systems belonging to various bulk and surface universality classes of critical phenomena .",
    "different geometries of confining surfaces have also been considered @xcite .",
    "these diverse studies show that critical casimir forces are very sensitive to tiny changes in temperature : a slight variation in the temperature can lead to pronounced changes in the range and magnitude of @xmath3 - even the sign of the force reverses .",
    "such sensitivity is rather rare but very valuable feature of effective interactions .",
    "it might be of importance for systems such as colloidal suspensions with a near - critical solvent . there , by tuning the critical casimir interactions arising between colloidal particles one can control the phase behavior @xcite of colloids , their aggregation and the stability of colloidal suspensions @xcite .    for colloids immersed in a binary liquid mixture , it has been observed that by varying temperature towards the bulk demixing phase boundary from a one - phase region of a solvent at its constant composition , the colloidal particles coagulate reversible at well defined near - critical temperatures @xcite .",
    "the strongest coagulation of colloids is observed for off - critical compositions of the solvent , i.e. , at thermodynamic states of the solvent which correspond to a nonzero conjugate ordering field @xmath4 of the order parameter of the solvent .",
    "recall that @xmath4 is the deviation @xmath5 of the chemical potential difference of the two species @xmath6 and @xmath7 forming a binary liquid mixture from its critical value , or a chemical potential deviation @xmath8 from its critical value in the case of a simple fluid .     and",
    "the surface field @xmath9 corresponding to the scaling variable @xmath10 . below the pseudo - critical point of the strip @xmath11 ( not determined here ) , this line can be identified with the pseudo - coexistence capillary condensation .",
    "thermodynamic paths of fixed scaling variable @xmath12 ( as indicated on the plot ) along which we have calculated the critical casimir force are shown by solid lines . for @xmath13 the chosen values of @xmath14 correspond to the bulk fields ( subsequently from the left to the right ) : @xmath15 . ]    various theoretical studies for systems belonging to the ising universality class provide some evidence @xcite for a pronounced dependence of critical casimir forces @xmath3 on @xmath4 .",
    "the only geometry considered so far in this context is the geometry of two parallel plates , however , the critical casimir scaling functions for parallel plates can be used to approximate the ones for the sphere - plate or sphere - sphere geometry .",
    "this can be done by using the derjaguin approximation in the limit of surface - to - surface separations small in comparison with the sphere radius @xcite .",
    "although in most experimental realizations , the temperature is varied at the fixed value of @xmath4 , no results for @xmath3 along such thermodynamic paths are available . in the present paper",
    "we report a systematic study of the critical casimir forces along several bulk iso - fields for a @xmath0 ising model with a strip geometry .",
    "we assume that boundaries of the strip are equal and belong to the so - called normal transition surface universality class @xmath16 @xcite , which is characterized by a strong effective surface field acting on the corresponding order parameter of a system .",
    "normal transition surface universality class is an appropriate characterization of a critical fluid in a presence of an external wall or a substrate @xcite . in the case of colloidal suspensions immersed in a binary liquid mixture ,",
    "surface fields describe a preference of colloidal particles for one of the two components of a binary liquid mixture .",
    "we consider the bulk iso - fields which lie on both sides of the bulk coexistence @xmath2 and close to it , where we expect the most pronounced variation of the critical casimir force . on that side of the bulk coexistence line which corresponds to the bulk phase not preferred by the surfaces ( e.g. , a negatively magnetized phase for positive surface fields ) , the bulk iso - fields cross the pseudo - coexistence line of capillary condensation , i.e. , the bulk pseudo - coexistence line shifted away from @xmath2 due to the confinement . we explore in some detail the behavior of @xmath3 as a function of temperature in the region between the capillary condensation line and the bulk coexistence line .    in order to calculate the free energy of a system we use a quasi - exact numerical density - matrix renormalization - group method ( dmrg ) .",
    "the dmrg method @xcite , which is based on the transfer matrix approach @xcite , provides a numerically very efficient iterative truncation algorithm for constructing the effective transfer matrices for strips of fixed width and infinite length @xcite . at present , strips of widths up to @xmath17 lattice constants can be studied .",
    "the quantitative data for thermodynamic quantities , especially the free energy , are very accurate and can be provided in a wide range of temperatures and in the presence of arbitrary bulk and surface fields .",
    "this allows to determine the scaling functions of the critical casimir forces .",
    "it is know that the critical casimir scaling function depends in a nontrivial way on the spatial dimension .",
    "however , the existing results along other thermodynamic paths , e.g. , along isotherms or along the bulk coexistence , show that the qualitative behavior of @xmath3 in higher spatial dimensions is similar to the one in @xmath0 ; we expect the same to be true also along the bulk iso - fields .",
    "results of our study are directly applicable to the lipid membranes .",
    "these are @xmath0 liquids consisting of two ( or more ) components , such as cholesterol and the saturated and unsaturated lipid , which undergo separation into two liquid phases , one rich in the first two components and the other rich in the third @xcite .",
    "lipid membranes serve as model systems for cell plasma membranes @xcite .",
    "recent experiments suggests that cell membranes are tuned to the miscibility critical point of @xmath0 ising model @xcite so that the critical casimir forces may arise between macromolecules embedded in the membrane @xcite .     and the surface field @xmath18 providing the scaling parameter @xmath10 .",

    "the scaling fields describing the deviation from the bulk criticality are the reduced temperature @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the bulk critical temperature , and the bulk magnetic field @xmath4 .",

    "<S> using quasi - exact numerical density - matrix renormalization - group techniques we calculate the critical casimir force for a two - dimensional ( @xmath0 ) ising strip with equal strong surface fields , along the thermodynamic paths corresponding to the fixed nonzero bulk field @xmath1 . using the derjaguin approximation </S>",
    "<S> we also determine the critical casimir force and its potential for two discs . </S>",
    "<S> we find that varying the temperature along the iso - fields lying between the bulk coexistence and the capillary condensation critical point leads to a dramatic increase of the critical casimir interactions with a qualitatively different functional dependence on the temperature than along @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> these findings might be of relevance for biomembranes , whose heterogeneity is recently interpreted as being connected with a critical behavior belonging to the @xmath0 ising universality class . </S>"
