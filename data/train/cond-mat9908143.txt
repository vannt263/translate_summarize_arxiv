    "since the discovery of weak localization twenty years ago @xcite much attention has been given to its scaling properties in low dimensions in infinite homogenious media .",
    "there is also weak localization correction to transort properties of a mesoscopic conductor that is shorter than decoherence length .",
    "such a conductor is neither scalable nor homogeneous , so that one generally expects the wlc to depend on details of sample structure .",
    "still , the wlc exhibits some universal features .",
    "we concentrate in this work on evaluation of wlc to transport properties of two - terminal mesoscopic diffusive conductor .",
    "we employ here a new technique that allows to calculate not only the current in the conductor but also all noise characteristics of the current , so - called _ full counting statistics_.@xcite beside the fact that this method provides more information about transport properties of the conductor than the traditional green s function @xcite and rmt @xcite methods , it gives compact and clear general expressions that are valid for inhomogeneous conductors .    due to the lack of space , it is impossible to review all the results obtained .",
    "we concentrate on the most important ones that concern the universal features of wlc : its form for quasi - one - dimensional conductors , general formula for the current correction and its possible dependence on momentum relaxation time , universal cooperon mode .",
    "we disregard influence of magnetic field and spin - orbit interaction of the wlc .",
    "the method in use presents an extension of keldysh green function ( kgf ) method ( see @xcite for review ) and is based on the following trick : let us define a one - electron green function by means of @xmath0 ( notations of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where @xmath1 is for the time being an one - electron arbitrary operator , @xmath2 is a time - dependent parameter , @xmath3 is @xmath4 matrix in keldysh indexes .",
    "it is easy to show by traditional diagrammatic methods that the expansion of @xmath5 in @xmath2 generates diagrams for higher order correlators of @xmath1 .",
    "the trick can be readily applied to the problem of full counting statistics of the current.@xcite to this end , we set @xmath1 to the operator of the current through a cross section of the conductor , @xmath2 to constant value .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the following @xmath6-dependent action to express the probability for @xmath7 electrons to be transferred through the conductor during time interval @xmath8 @xmath9 derivatives of @xmath10 give moments of @xmath11 , first and second derivative corresponding to average current and current noise respectively .      to calcultate @xmath10 in semiclassical limit for duffusive conductor ,",
    "one derives a diffusion equation for the new kgf in coinciding points , @xmath12 , @xmath13 being density of states .",
    "it turns out that @xmath14 and the equation takes traditional form @xcite @xmath15 at any energy , d being diffusive coefficient .",
    "the boundary conditions to eq .",
    "[ difu ] are set by kgf in terminals , terms with @xmath6 can be incorporated into these conditions , so that @xmath16 equals @xmath17 in the right and left reservoir respectively , @xmath18 being electron distribution functions in corresponding reservoirs .",
    "the equation [ difu ] can be solved in a rather general form yielding @xmath19 where @xmath20 satisfies diffusion equation with boundary conditions @xmath21 .",
    "physically , @xmath20 is a normalized voltage distribution in the conductor .",
    "this solution leads to the following quasiclassical action : @xmath22\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath23 being full conductance .",
    "this generalizes results of @xcite , those were obtained by rmt methods .",
    "one can find in @xcite why both methods give the same results .",
    "the advantage of the method is that one obtains the wlc directly to @xmath10 .",
    "it is given by a usual cooperon ladder @xcite ( fig .",
    "1 ) made of new kgf . due to its ladder nature , the correction can be express in terms of eigenvalues @xmath24 of the ladder section operator @xmath25 where @xmath26 presents impurity potential .",
    "it reads @xmath27 here dimensionless @xmath28 characterize cooperon propagation .",
    "we derive corresponding diffusion equation for these eigenvalues and matrix eigenfunction @xmath29 , @xmath30 it is essential that the eigenvalues do depend on @xmath31 , the momentum relaxation time .",
    "this is not the same as transport scattering time that enters diffusion coefficient and in principle shall be considered as an independent parameter .",
    "the relevant branch of eigenvalues corresponds to @xmath32 .",
    "that simplifies the equation considerably .",
    "finally we arrive at the following relation for eigenvalues @xmath28 @xmath33 that implicitly presents the result for the wlc in the most general form .",
    "we note an interesting feature of the results : although each eigenvalue @xmath34 does depend on @xmath31 , the wlc does not since the corrections to different @xmath34 cancel each other .",
    "so that we can replace @xmath34 by effective @xmath35 those are given by equation that does not contain @xmath31 @xmath36    since @xmath37 at @xmath38 , and the average current @xmath39 , the wlc to conductivity is obtained by perturbation expansion in @xmath40 yielding @xmath41 where brackets denote average with respect to @xmath42-th cooperon state at @xmath43 .      there is even more universality in the case of quasi - one - dimensional conductor where d(x ) depends only on single coordinate and only one cooperon branch has to be taken into account .",
    "the eigenvalues reduce to @xmath44 , @xmath45 and the spatial dependence of diffusion coefficient is of no importance .",
    "the sum in [ wcl ] can be taken explicitly yielding @xmath46      at @xmath47 cooperon eigenvalues never approach zero .",
    "this is a kind of finite - size effect specific for mesoscopic conductor .",
    "we note that there is a universal cooperon mode with eigenfunction @xmath48 that becomes gapless in the absence of magnetic field provided @xmath49 .",
    "this indicates a strong divergence of wlc in this regime that can be lifted by magnetic field .",
    "@xmath40 approaches @xmath50 in the limit of @xmath51 that corresponds to a current fluctuation which is much smaller than the average current .",
    "these fuctuations are exponentially suppessed by @xmath52 , and diverging @xmath53 provides anomalous magnetic dependence of their probability .",
