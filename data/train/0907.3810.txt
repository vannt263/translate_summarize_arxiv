    "weighted networks represent the natural framework to describe natural , social , and technological systems , in which the intensity of a relation or the traffic between elements are important parameters @xcite . in general terms , weighted networks ( wn ) are an extension of the concept of network or graph @xcite , in which each edge between vertices @xmath0 and @xmath1 has associated a variable , called weight , taking the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the adjacency matrix and @xmath4 is a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "practical realizations of weights in real networks range from the number of passengers traveling yearly between two airports in the airport network @xcite , to the intensity of predator - prey interactions in ecosystems @xcite or the traffic measured in packets per unit time between routers in the internet @xcite .",
    "a non - weighted network can thus be understood as a binary network , in which @xmath5 , taking the value @xmath6 when vertices @xmath0 and @xmath1 are connected , and zero otherwise . leaving aside the issue of the proper characterization of the topological observables associated to networks and their weighted extensions @xcite , a most relevant aspect of wn is the effect of the weight distribution and structure on the properties of dynamical processes taking place on top of them @xcite .",
    "these can have an impact in problems ranging from the information transport in mobile communication networks @xcite , the risks of congestion on internet @xcite , the disease spreading in the air transportation network @xcite or biological issues such as the role of weak interactions in ecological networks @xcite .",
    "in general , the theoretical understanding of dynamical processes on networks is based at a mesoscopic level on the heterogeneous mean - field ( hmf ) approximation and the annealed network approach @xcite , which assume that the degree is the only relevant variable characterizing the vertices , and that dynamical fluctuations are not relevant .",
    "all dynamical variables can therefore be described in terms of deterministic rate equations , as a function of time and degree . here",
    ", we develop the hmf theory for general local diffusive processes on wn by extending the annealed network approximation @xcite to the weighted case .",
    "we also define the concept of _ annealed weighted network _ ,",
    "in which hmf theory is exact .",
    "we show the validity of our approach by obtaining an exact mean - field solution of the paradigmatic random walk process on wn .",
    "a comparison with numerical simulations allows to set the limits of validity of hmf on quenched weighted networks , showing also that it yields in some cases severely incorrect results . finally , we present an example of the application of the annealed weighted network approximation to more complex dynamics on wn to obtain hmf rate equations .",
    "our approach allows for a straightforward mean - field description of diffusive dynamics on weighted networks , but at the same time calls for a careful interpretation of mean - field results on quenched networks , an issue already discussed in the non - weighted case @xcite .",
    "hmf indeed does not take into account the quenched structure of the considered network , which however can play a fundamental role inducing strong deviations even in the apparently safe case in which only degree dependent weights are present .",
    "this should be recalled when mean - field predictions are to be compared with numerical simulations or used as a baseline to make predictions on processes on real weighted networks .",
    "the hmf theory for dynamical processes on binary complex networks is ultimately based on the annealed network approach @xcite , that consists in replacing the adjacency matrix @xmath3 , which in a real quenched network is composed by zeros and ones at fixed positions , by the probability @xmath7 that vertices @xmath0 and @xmath1 are connected . at a statistical degree coarse - grained level , we can replace @xmath3 by the ensemble average @xmath8 @xcite , defined as the probability that two vertices of degree @xmath9 and @xmath10 are connected ; that is , by the degree class average ( for undirected networks ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes a sum over the set of vertices of degree @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the degree distribution ( probability that a randomly chosen vertex is connected with other @xmath13 vertices ) @xcite and @xmath15 is the conditional probability that a vertex of degree @xmath13 is connected to a vertex of degree @xmath16 @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the original network is replaced by a fully connected graph in which each edge has associated a connection probability @xmath8 that depends only on the degree of its endpoints .",
    "the annealed network approach can be directly applied in calculations at the microscopic ( vertex ) level or , otherwise , fruitfully extended to a more intuitive mesoscopic ( degree class ) level . in the case of diffusive dynamics",
    ", the reasoning runs as follows . in diffusive dynamics , particles or interactions move from one vertex to another by jumping to a randomly chosen nearest neighbor .",
    "therefore , the probability that vertex @xmath0 interacts with vertex @xmath1 , @xmath17 ( the _ propagator _ of the diffusive interaction ) , is given by @xmath18 performing a coarse - graining in degree classes , we can define the probability that a vertex of degree @xmath13 interacts with a vertex of degree @xmath16 , namely @xmath19^{-1 } \\sum_{i \\in k }",

    "( [ eq:1 ] ) . with this concept in hand ,",
    "writing down the hmf rate equations for any diffusive dynamical process turns out to be straightforward @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ eq:2 ] ) also encodes the idea of an _ annealed network _ @xcite . in opposition to quenched networks , in which edges are frozen between pairs of vertices , annealed networks are dynamical objects , changing in time over a certain timescale @xmath20 , while keeping constant the degree distribution @xmath14 and correlations @xmath15 . when the network time scale is very small , @xmath21 , connections in the network are completely reshuffled between any two microscopic steps of the dynamics . in this case , the annealed network is completely defined by the quantities @xmath14 and @xmath15 . from a computational point of view , a diffusive dynamics is easily simulated in these networks , by assigning to each vertex of degree @xmath13 nearest neighbors that are randomly selected among all the vertices in the network , according to the probability @xmath22 . in the case of degree",

    "writing the mean - field rate equations for most diffusive dynamical processes on wn is now easy : the analytics describing the dynamics on simple binary networks can be generalized to the weighted case simply by replacing the propagator @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",

    "therefore , an annealed weighted network can be understood as an annealed binary network , which is completely reshuffled between dynamic time steps , preserving its degree distribution @xmath14 and an effective degree correlation pattern given by @xmath42 .",

    "overall , our work provides a straightforward method to describe any dynamical process on weighted network in therms of hmf , but it also puts a word of warning in a _ tout court _ extrapolation of hmf results to real quenched weighted network .",
    "in fact , while hmf provides a first estimate of the behavior of diffusive systems when the weights are not excessively strong , it fails in the regime of large weights . these observations add a new ingredient to the issue of the non mean - field behavior observed in several dynamical processes on binary networks @xcite .",
    "this mean - field failure can in some cases be attributed to the build up of dynamical correlations between vertices @xcite , especially at low particle densities , that invalidate the hmf assumptions .",
    "in fact , when considering the effects of weights on dynamics the situation becomes more complex , as the random walk analysis proves . in this case",
    ", dynamical correlations can not play any role , since we are dealing with a single particle .",
    "the lack of mean - field behavior must thus be ascribed to the presence of _ topological traps _ , which slow down the dynamics and are enhanced by the presence of strong weights .",
    "the development of new theoretical tools beyond mean - field to tackle the understanding of dynamical systems in such critical structures , and incorporating these elements , becomes therefore an important future research venue .",
