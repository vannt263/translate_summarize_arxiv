    "interference is a main performance - limiting factor in wireless systems .",
    "it is spatially correlated since it stems from a single set of transmitters  even in the presence of independent fading .",
    "it is temporally correlated since a subset from the same given set of nodes transmits in different time slots .",
    "while it has been long recognized that _ correlated fading _ reduces the performance gain in multi - antenna communications , see , , @xcite , interference correlation has been completely ignored until very recently .    in this paper , we analyze the effect of interference correlation on multi - antenna reception in poisson networks , where interferers form a poisson point process ( ppp ) , using tools from stochastic geometry and point process theory .    a fundamental source of delay in wireless networks is the time it takes for a node to successfully connect to a nearby neighbor .",
    "consequently , the _ local delay",
    "_ , defined as the mean time , in numbers of time slots , until a packet is successfully received over a link between nearest neighbors , is an important quantity to study .",
    "we focus on the case where nodes are distributed on the two - dimensional plane as a homogeneous poisson point process ( ppp ) .",
    "we tackle the problem in three steps .",
    "first , we analyze the local delay in a poisson network with interference but without noise . by poisson network here",
    "we mean that both the set of all nodes and the set of transmitters form ppps , which implies that the channel access scheme is ( slotted ) aloha . the channel fading and the transmit / receive",
    "states are assumed iid over time , while the nodes are either highly mobile , in which case a new realization of the ppp is drawn in each time slot , or completely static , in which case only a single realization exists , and the nodes stay fixed forever .",
    "secondly , we ignore interference but consider random link distances . in this case",
    ", the  network \" is just a collection of independent links .",
    "we take the distances to be static ( but random ) and derive the mean delay ( ensemble average ) over the links for different types of fading and power control strategies .",
    "thirdly , we combine noise and interference .",
    "it turns out that without power control , the local delay is infinite for all path loss exponents .",
    "so power control is critical , but it complicates the analysis since it changes the interference distribution",
    ".    a mathematical framework for the analysis of the local delay in poisson networks is provided in ( * ? ? ?",
    "17.5 ) and @xcite .",
    "we build on this framework and our preliminary work in @xcite to obtain concrete results on the local delay for all four basic types of nearest - neighbor transmission .",
    "we also derive optimum transmit probabilities that minimize the delay and analyze the asymptotic behavior of the minimum achievable local delay in detail .",
    "we shall see that in some cases , the local delay is infinite .",
    "this phenomenon is called _ wireless contention phase transition _ in @xcite .",
    "an infinite local delay does not imply that certain nodes can not reach their nearest neighbors in finite time ; in fact , conditioned on the link distance , the local delay is always finite .",
    "it implies , however , that the distribution of the local delay has a heavy tail , or , in other words , that the fraction of links with large local delays is significant .        the first explicit results on the interference correlation in spatial networks appeared in @xcite .",
    "denoting the interference at location @xmath0 in time slot @xmath1 by @xmath2 , it was shown that the temporal ( pearson s ) correlation coefficient in a poisson network with aloha transmit probability @xmath3 , unit transmit powers , and independent and identically distributed ( iid ) block fading with second moment @xmath4 is @xmath5 this remarkably simple result shows that the correlation coefficient is proportional to the transmit probability and that rayleigh block fading cuts the correlation to a half compared to the case of no fading .",
    "so the common randomness of the node positions causes a significant correlation in the interference , even with severe iid fading .",
    "another line of work that implicitly addresses interference correlation focuses on the local delay . the local delay , introduced in ( * ? ? ?",
    "17 ) and @xcite and further analyzed in @xcite , is defined as the mean time it takes a node to successfully communicate with its nearest neighbor .",
    "the transmission success events are correlated but they are _ conditionally independent _ given the point process , which permits closed - form expressions in the case of poisson networks @xcite .",
    "it turns out that if the transmitter density exceeds a critical value , the correlation in the success events is strong enough so that nearest - neighbor communication is no longer possible in finite time on average .",
    "so the local delay is not only a basic metric that quantifies the performance of a network , it is also a sensitive indicator of correlation .",
    "we consider a _ poisson network _ , where the interferers , all equipped with one antenna , form a stationary poisson point process ( ppp ) @xmath6 of intensity @xmath7 .",
    "the receiver under consideration is assumed to be located at the origin @xmath8 and equipped with @xmath9 antennas , and a desired transmitter is added at distance @xmath10 from the origin .",
    "all channels are subject to iid rayleigh fading .",

    ", it is well known that @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "despite the independent fading , the interference at each antenna is correlated due to the common interferer locations , hence the events @xmath22 and @xmath23 are not independent .",

    "let @xmath31 .",
    "then the sir condition for a single antenna is @xmath32 and we have @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the iid fading coefficients to each antenna , and @xmath35 is the interference at each antenna , correlated through the common randomness @xmath36 .",
    "we obtain @xmath37 ( a ) follows from the independence of the fading random variables @xmath38 , and ( b ) follows from the probability generating functional of the ppp .",
    "the last step is the calculation of the integral , which yields the result .",
    "we term the polynomial @xmath39 the _ diversity polynomial_. the first four are @xmath40 and a general expression is @xmath41 for all @xmath42 , since @xmath43 , @xmath44  @xmath45 \" indicates an upper bound with asymptotic equality , here as @xmath46 .",
    "the diversity polynomials for @xmath47 are shown in , together with these lower and upper bounds .",
    "the polynomial may also be defined by its @xmath28 roots @xmath48\\ ] ] and fixing either @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "since all the coefficients are positive , @xmath51 is convex for @xmath52 and thus bounded by @xmath53 the derivative is asymptotically @xmath54 for @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the result is exact , , @xmath57 , @xmath58 . from the bounds in it follows that @xmath59 @xmath60 and the bounds are shown in .",
    "if the interference was independent across the antennas , we would have @xmath61    due to the dependence , @xmath62 for all @xmath63 and only @xmath50 , but @xmath64 corresponds to @xmath65 , which would imply @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the dependence increases as @xmath68 ( with growing @xmath69 ) . for @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 ( complete correlation ) .",
    "[ cor : div_loss ] the diversity loss , defined as @xmath73 , is @xmath74 as @xmath46 , @xmath75 .    from thm .",
    "[ thm : simo_prob ] we obtain @xmath76 . for the limit ,",
    "we need to show that @xmath77 this holds since @xmath78 and @xmath63 .",
    "the fact that @xmath79 is also apparent from the asymptotic behavior of the derivative .",
    "next we determine the conditional probability that @xmath80 holds given that @xmath81 hold .",
    "@xmath82 and @xmath83    the conditional probability is @xmath84 , which , using the recursion @xmath85 , yields the result .",
    "the limit follows from the proof of cor .",
    "[ cor : div_loss ] .",
    "so the correlation is strong enough that , assuming @xmath86 , for each @xmath87 , there is an @xmath1 such that for any @xmath88 , @xmath22 occurs with probability exceeding @xmath89 if @xmath90 hold .",
    "let @xmath91 be the indicator that @xmath22 occurs .",
    "pearson s correlation coefficient between @xmath92 and @xmath93 , @xmath94 , is @xmath95 the correlation coefficients for different parameters are shown in .",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath96 ( full correlation ) for @xmath70 , while @xmath97 for @xmath64 .",
    "so a larger path loss exponent @xmath98 results in higher correlation .",
    "this can be explained as follows : for large @xmath69 , the interference is dominated by a few nearby interferers , and if one of them is close enough to cause an outage at one antenna , it is likely to do so also at another .",
    "conversely , as @xmath99 , the interference is dominated by the many far interferers , each one with an independently fading channel to each antenna , which decorrelates the events .    in the high - reliability regime ,",
    "where @xmath100 or @xmath25 is small , the correlation is the largest ; it is upper bounded by and approaches @xmath101 as @xmath102 or @xmath103 .      in a selection combining scheme",
    ", a transmission is successful if @xmath104 } \\{\\sir_k\\ } > \\theta$ ] .",
    "the probability @xmath105 that the sir at at least one antenna exceeds the threshold follows from as @xmath106 assuming independent interference , the probability of the same event would be @xmath107 which differs substantially from . the gap between the outage probabilities @xmath108 and @xmath109 is illustrated in . while there is always a gain in increasing the number of antennas @xmath110 ,",
    "it is significantly smaller than under the assumption of independent interference .",
    "also , it can be observed that the outage probability is no longer monotonically decreasing in @xmath69 for all @xmath110 .    while @xmath111 quickly as @xmath46 , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath105 is less clear .",
    "a plot is shown in .",
    "we have the following result .    for all @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and , as @xmath46 , @xmath115    conditioned on @xmath36 ,",
    "the success probability goes to @xmath116 since all events @xmath22 are independent ( and have positive probability ) , , @xmath117 .",
    "thus @xmath118 which is the same as the desired limit @xmath119 by monotone convergence .",
    "for the bound on the tail probability , let @xmath120 for @xmath86 .",
    "we have @xmath121 replacing spatial diversity with temporal diversity , we can apply ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2 ) and set the transmit probability to @xmath116 ( since in our case all interferers always transmit ) , and it follows that @xmath122 .",
    "so diverges , which means that @xmath123 decays more slowly than @xmath124 for any @xmath87 .",
    "the complete joint sir distribution for @xmath125 is @xmath126    from thm .  1",
    ", we obtain @xmath127 by the replacement @xmath128 in the last two lines of the derivation in the proof . since @xmath129 the result follows from .    for comparison ,",

    "the diversity loss can be quantified exactly using the _ diversity polynomial_. its effects are that @xmath131 as opposed to @xmath132 for independent interference , and that the success probability in a selection combining scheme approaches @xmath116 at best polynomially instead of exponentially .    the larger the path loss exponent ( the smaller @xmath133 ) , the more drastic the effect of the interference correlation .",
