    "compared to the skin depth one expects a symmetric absorption spectrum ( @xmath40 = 0 ) , whereas for samples large compared to the skin depth absorption and dispersion are of equal strength yielding an asymmetric resonance line ( @xmath40 = 1 ) .",
    "a second reason for the asymmetry , which also occurs in insulators , arises from the influence of non diagonal elements of the dynamic susceptibility : in systems with interactions of low symmetry and sufficiently broad resonance lines ( @xmath43 ) the line shape shows characteristic distortions depending on the frequency and orientation of the exciting microwave field @xcite , where eq .",
    "( [ dyson ] ) yields a useful approximation of the spectrum .    comparing the spectra at 200 k with those at 300 k",
    "one recognizes an increasing asymmetry with increasing temperature : the average d / a ratio increases from about 0.05 at 200 k to 0.35 at 300 k. this can be understood in terms of the skin effect due to the increase of the conductivity with increasing temperature .",

    "they appear to be strongest for the @xmath37 plane , where the d / a ratio exhibits the most pronounced angular dependence . at the same time the d / a ratio is strongly correlated with the resonance linewidth , as they both attain their maximum values at the same angle .",
    "however , for these broad signals , the baseline is not so well defined as in the case of narrow lines and a shift in the d / a ratio can be compensated by resonance field and baseline . for this reason , the angular dependence of the d / a ratio can be an artificial effect , which is probably related to the large linewidth .",
