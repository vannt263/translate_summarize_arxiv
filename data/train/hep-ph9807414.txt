    "the final - state interaction in the nonleptonic weak decay is difficult to estimate when a large number of multibody channels are open . while the short - distance final - state interaction is small@xcite and its computation is noncontroversial , we have little understanding , theoretically or experimentally , of the long - distance final - state interactions .",
    "the long - distance final - state interaction phases were computed from the high - energy regge exchange amplitudes in the elastic rescattering approximation@xcite .",
    "the experimental data appeared in favor of large final - state interaction phases at least for the @xmath3 decay@xcite .",
    "it was asserted that the measured phases of the two - body @xmath3 decay amplitudes can be reproduced in the elastic approximation to the final hadron interactions@xcite .",
    "however , it is fairly obvious from an analysis of the partial - wave unitarity with the diffractive scattering@xcite that the elastic approximation can not be justified at high mass scales , for instance , in the b decay where the two - body final states can couple to a very large number of multibody final states",
    ". even when we are interested in the final - state interaction phases of the two - body channels alone , we can not determine them without knowing the coupling of the two - body channels to the multibody channels .",
    "the regge amplitudes alone do not provide all necessary pieces of information .",
    "actually , strong interactions and cp - conserving weak interactions are entangled in the decay phases . in this paper",
    "we shall make a modest attempt toward understanding of the inelastic final - state interactions .",
    "because of the limitation in the numerical computation of the long - distance effects , we are able to present our results only in a semiquantitative way .",
    "we present two approaches here .",
    "the first one uses the analyticity of the s - matrix .",
    "for the two - body decay , the phase and the magnitude of amplitude are tightly related to each other by a dispersion relation no matter how many multibody channels couple to two - body channels .",
    "the same phase - amplitude relation does not hold for the multibody decay .",
    "so far no theorist has ever attempted to study the correlation between the phase and the magnitude from this aspect .",
    "no dynamical assumption is introduced in this approach .",
    "the origin of difficulty in the final - state interaction at high mass scales is in that so many channels are open and communicate with each other . in the second approach",
    "we analyze the decay in terms of the @xmath1-channel eigenstates of the s - matrix and treat a large number of open eigenchannels statistically by introducing a randomness hypothesis@xcite .",
    "while we give up much of numerical predictability in this approach , we are still able to see general trends in the final - state interaction at high mass scales .",
    "both approaches lead us to conclude that the long - distance final - state interaction phases should be small for two - body heavy hadron decay .",
    "though our conclusion favoring small final - state interactions may be in line of some of the existing literature , our method and picture are completely orthogonal to them .    in section",
    "ii , after a brief review of the analyticity of the decay amplitude into general @xmath4-body channels , we derive for the two - body decay a dispersion relation which relates the phase and the amplitude through the omns - mushkelishvili integral@xcite . using this dispersion relation we separate from the physical decay amplitude the final - state interactions below an arbitrarily chosen timelike energy scale .",
    "we see in this form that a final - state interaction phase of any origin can not persist to very high energies .    in section iii , we shall study the final - state interaction phases from the viewpoint of the eigenphase shifts of the strong - interaction s - matrix .",
    "we write the hadron scattering amplitude in terms of the eigenphase shifts , and classify the eigenchannels into the resonant and nonresonant ones according to the dual resonance model .",
    "then we express the final - state interaction in terms of the eigenphase shifts .",
    "we study the high - energy behaviors of the eigenphase shifts from the scattering data .    in section",
    "iv we introduce the dynamical postulate that the composition of eigenchannels is statistically random when very many of them exist in degeneracy .",
    "we make a quantitative estimate of the decay amplitude phases within the limitation of the method .    finally in section",
    "v , we apply our findings to the actual @xmath3 and @xmath2 decays . for the @xmath3 decay , the elastic approximation combined with the regge asymptotic behavior is not allowed in determining the final - state interaction phases .",
    "the random - phase method is probably a poor approximation .",
    "the observed large phase difference between different isospin channels can be accommodated but not predicted .",
    "the random phase approximation has the best chance in the @xmath2 decay where the final hadron multiplicity is high .",
    "all two - body decay amplitudes are dominantly real up to cp violations in the @xmath2 decay . if the color suppression exists prior to final - state interaction corrections , it should be preserved even in the presence of final - state interactions .",
    "interestingly , the same high - energy behavior of the eigenphase shifts that makes the elastic scattering amplitudes purely imaginary leads to the almost real two - body decay amplitudes .",
    "we consider the weak decay @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a heavy particle such as the @xmath3 and @xmath2 mesons .",
    "the final state is generally a multiparticle state of @xmath4 hadrons .",
    "going off the @xmath6 mass shell , we call the @xmath6 mass squared as the variable @xmath1 and examine the analytic property of the invariant decay amplitude @xmath7 in the complex @xmath1-plane",
    ".    the analytic property of the s - matrix elements was extensively studied decades ago@xcite .",
    "we obtained many rules of computation by examining the feynman diagrams though a rigorous proof without referring to the diagrams was given only in the limited cases . to avoid inessential complications",
    ", we consider the case where @xmath6 and the final hadrons are all spinless .",
    "we shall use the _ in - out _",
    "formalism@xcite to simplify our notations .",
    "the invariant amplitude for the decay into the @xmath4-hadron state @xmath8 is defined by @xmath9 where the one - particle states are normalized as @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is actually the function of all possible lorentz invariants made of @xmath12 and @xmath13 . aside from @xmath14 , there are @xmath15 independent invariants , which we may choose as @xmath16 since there is one linear dependency relation , @xmath17 we may include short - distance strong interactions in @xmath18 by using the qcd - corrected effective hamiltonian .",
    "though we shall treat @xmath18 as a local operator , the analytic property to be discussed below does not depend on locality of @xmath18 .",
    "what is important is that @xmath18 transfers no energy - momentum .    to study analyticity",
    ", we introduce the auxiliary ( unphysical ) amplitude , @xmath19 we can obtain @xmath20 by imposing the incoming boundary condition on the @xmath4 hadrons in eq.([amp ] ) .",
    "diagramatically , it amounts to flipping the sign of @xmath21 in all feynman propagators .",
    "if @xmath18 is time - reversal invariant , it holds that @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are obtained from @xmath12 and @xmath13 by reversing the signs of their space components .",
    "eq.([timereversal ] ) reads @xmath25 where the asterisk denotes a complex conjugate .",
    "the reversal of the signs of the space components of @xmath12 does not change the lorentz invariants , @xmath26 and @xmath1 . since",
    "both @xmath27 and @xmath28 are real below all thresholds and therefore coincide with each other there , eq.([timereversal2 ] ) means that they actually represent values of a single analytic function on two different riemannn sheets . in terms of the lorentz invariants , eq.([timereversal2 ] ) can be written as @xmath29 when @xmath18 is not t - invariant , it is convenient to work with each short - distance - corrected weak hamiltonian individually after separating out a t - violating phase ; @xmath30 . then eq.([ra ] ) is valid for @xmath31 .",
    "we shall use the words `` t - violation '' and `` cp - violation '' as equivalent , assuming the cpt invariance .",
    "one problem about the multibody decay amplitude is that there are so many variables ; three independent variables even for the three - body decay , one more than in the mandelstam representation for two - body scattering .",
    "more a serious obstacle is that the real analyticity relation eq.([ra ] ) holds only when we go across all cuts in @xmath1 and @xmath26 from @xmath32 to @xmath33 simultaneously .",
    "we are able to write a dispersion relation in one of the variables keeping the others fixed , for instance , in variable @xmath1 keeping @xmath34 ) fixed to @xmath35 .",
    "then @xmath36 , which is not simply related to the physical amplitude , enters the dispersion integral . in the case of a three - body final state , for instance",
    ", such an amplitude is the complex conjugate of the unphysical amplitude @xmath37 in which the particle pairs ( 1,2 ) and ( 1,3 ) interact with the wrong sign phases @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , while the particle pair ( 2,3 ) interacts with the right sign phase @xmath40 . only for the two - body decay amplitudes does eq.([ra ] ) give the simple real analyticity relation : @xmath41 so that the discontinuity in the complex @xmath1-plane is directly related to a physical process .",
    "for the decays of @xmath0 , we can write only multivariable dispersion relations as an extension of the mandelstam representation .",
    "we see little chance of extracting a useful information out of them .",
    "the standard dispersion relation relates the real part of @xmath7 to the imaginary part . to relate the phase to the magnitude",
    ", we write the dispersion relation for logarithm of @xmath7 .",
    "notice that @xmath42 has the same analytic property as @xmath7 except for cuts due to zeros of @xmath7 . choosing the contour of the cauchy integral as usual",
    ", we can write the dispersion relation in the once - subtracted form : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the lowest threshold of final states . the phase @xmath45 should be normalized to zero at @xmath46 in this representation to keep @xmath42 finite at @xmath46 .",
    "when eq.([omnes1 ] ) is exponentiated , it is the representation of mushkelishvili which was first applied by omns to a study of the electromagnetic form factors .",
    "hereafter we shall refer to this exponentiated dispersion relation as the omns - mushkelishvili representation@xcite .",
    "the application was limited to the energy region where the two - body scattering is elastic .",
    "contrary to some misconception@xcite , however , the same dispersion relation can be derived for the two - body decay even in the presence of inelastic channels .",
    "we emphasize this point since otherwise the representation will be of no use in the heavy hadron decay .",
    "the key observation here is that once the phase along the cut is known , a real analytic function is unique .",
    "actually there is one uncertainty that can not be fixed by the analyticity .",
    "it arises from possible zeros of @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath7 has zeros at @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , they generate logarithmic singularities for @xmath42 and contribute to the dispersion integral .",
    "when such zeros are included , the amplitude @xmath7 is expressed as @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "we need some physical argument to determine the polynomial @xmath51 . in the days of the bootstrap theory we used to resort to a certain philosophy of determinism : there must not be a free parameter which we can not control on .",
    "we do not think that we can argue along the same line in the context of qcd .",
    "in our case we avoid this problem as follows .",
    "let us write eq.([omnes2 ] ) back in the form @xmath52 and then define @xmath53 by @xmath54 @xmath53 is the unphysical decay amplitude in which the final - state interactions of the energy range from the threshold to @xmath55 has been removed . in terms of this amplitude ,",
    "the physical decay matrix element @xmath7 is expressed as @xmath56 in this form all strong - interaction corrections below @xmath55 are explicitly factored out in the exponent .",
    "the correction factor includes both short- and long - distance corrections except for the interaction responsible for formation of hadrons . concerning the hadron formation interaction , we encounter a fundamental issue in the final - state interaction theory .",
    "both the final - state interactions and the formation of hadrons result from the same qcd force . nonetheless , in order to formulate the final - state interaction theory , we must separate the hadron formation forces from the long - distance interactions between hadrons .",
    "the representation above provides one way to do so .",
    "while @xmath53 can not be measured in experiment , it is the closest to what theorists have been calculating for decay matrix elements by various methods without final - state interactions .",
    "the appropriate choice of a value for @xmath57 in eq.([omnes3 ] ) is @xmath58    a remark is in order on the two - body final state .",
    "the dispersion relation in eq.([omnes3 ] ) holds for any two - body final state . in the elastic energy region",
    ", we normally choose an isospin or an su(3 ) eigenstate for it .",
    "the reason is that such a state is an eigenchannel of the strong interaction s - matrix , and therefore that the phase is identified with the strong interaction phase by watson s theorem@xcite . at high energies where two - body states couple to multibody final states , however , two - body final states are",
    "no longer eigenstates of the s - matrix , no matter which isospin states we may choose .",
    "then it happens that the net phase @xmath45 of the two - body decay amplitude depends not only on strong interactions but also on weak interactions , even when one computes amplitudes due to a single effective weak hamiltonian .",
    "though this was already pointed out@xcite in the past , it is worth emphasizing since it is the origin of all complications when rescattering is inelastic .",
    "we shall see the point more clearly in section iii . from this viewpoint , two - body isospin eigenstates in the inelastic region are just as bad as the @xmath59 eigenstates of indefinite isospin in the elastic region .",
    "when inelastic channels are open , writing for instance the decay amplitudes for @xmath60 in the @xmath61 and @xmath62 amplitudes contributes to very little to solving the problem .",
    "imagine that @xmath45 approaches the asymptotic value @xmath63 at some value @xmath64 well below @xmath65 : approaches its asymptopia as early as hadron scattering amplitudes do .",
    "if @xmath45 should keep oscillating , @xmath42 would behave like @xmath66 along some direction in the complex @xmath1-plane , which would prevent us from writing the dispersion relation to start with . ]",
    "@xmath67 the exponent of eq.([omnes3 ] ) can be estimated for such @xmath45 as @xmath68 the contribution of o@xmath69 from the region below @xmath70 is negligibly small if @xmath71 .",
    "the dominant contribution comes from the asymptotic energy region .",
    "when exponentiated , this integral generates an enhancement or suppression factor of @xmath72 for @xmath7 .",
    "if , for instance , the phase reaches @xmath73 , the strong interaction correction would alter the amplitude by factor 16 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "it means an enhancement or a suppression of factor @xmath76 in rate .",
    "there is no evidence for such a huge dynamical enhancement or suppression when we compare the observed two - body decay rates with the theoretical estimates in the @xmath3 and @xmath2 decays .",
    "the so - called color suppression observed in the b decay should be attributed not to a severe dynamical suppression by strong interactions but to lack of strong - interaction corrections , since the suppression exists prior to final - state interactions .",
    "the obvious alternative to the asymptotic behavior of eq.([asym ] ) is @xmath77 the enhancement or suppression is milder in this case .",
    "the fractional power @xmath72 does not appear in the conventional calculation of the decay matrix elements .",
    "the short - distance qcd corrections enter in fractional powers of @xmath78 . _",
    "if _ we wish to reproduce the short - distance correction factor of the renormalization group with our final - state interaction integral , we would choose such that @xmath45 approach zero asymptotically as @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 is a constant determined by the anomalous dimension of @xmath18 , and @xmath82 is from the running qcd coupling .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of eq.([rgbehavior ] ) leads to @xmath83 for the amplitude .",
    "since our correction factor includes both short- and long - distance effects , eq.([rgbehavior ] ) should represent only the portion of the asymptotic phase that is attributed to the short - distance interactions .",
    "we must study the long - distance effects by some other means .",
    "the main result of our dispersion relation is that the phase of the two - body decay amplitude of a heavy hadron should be zero or a small value for a large initial mass ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "it should certainly not be @xmath85 .",
    "it is worth noting that , unlike the phase , the magnitude of the amplitude can be subject to substantial final - state interaction corrections since it picks up the effects of all energies .",
    "in this section we study the decay phases from the viewpoint of the eigenphases of the s - matrix of high - energy scattering . we need to know about the composition of the eigenchannels and their high - energy asymptotic behavior .",
    "we shall use the dual resonance model as our guide since it is the most successful model that incorporates the relevant aspects of the quark model spectroscopy and long - distance hadron scattering .    the partial - wave s - matrix of strong - interaction is diagonalized in terms of the eigenchannels carrying the quantum numbers of hadron @xmath6 .",
    "labeling the eigenchannels by @xmath86 we can express the s - matrix elements as @xmath87 without loss of generality we normalize the eigenphase shifts to zero at their respective thresholds .",
    "experimentally observed are the hadronic states with each particle carrying definite momentum .",
    "we project those states onto the @xmath88 eigenstates and denote them by @xmath89 . by completeness of eigenchannels , @xmath89 can be expanded as @xmath90 where we can choose @xmath91 to be an orthogonal matrix as a consequence of t - invariance for strong interactions .",
    "the partial - wave amplitude @xmath92 for elastic scattering is expanded in the eigenphase shifts as @xmath93 or in the real and imaginary parts , @xmath94 both @xmath91 and @xmath95 are @xmath1-dependent . strictly speaking ,",
    "once multibody states are included , we must label the eigenchannels with continuous parameters .",
    "therefore the discrete summation in eqs.([expansion ] ) and ( [ scattering ] ) is symbolic .",
    "the state density per unit energy in a volume characteristic of strong interactions ( @xmath96 ) may substitute as the effective number of states for multibody channels .",
    "actually the dual resonance model@xcite of the late 1960 s answers to how many states exist at energy @xmath97 . in this model ,",
    "the number of states was counted to be@xcite @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the regge slope ( @xmath1001gev@xmath101 ) , @xmath102 is the space - time dimension , and @xmath103 , which takes a value @xmath104mev for @xmath105 .",
    "this state density @xmath106 contains the states of all angular momentum @xmath107 at mass @xmath97 for the interval of @xmath108 1gev@xmath109 . while the highest @xmath110 state has no degeneracy , degeneracy of states rapidly increases with descending @xmath110 .",
    "it also includes the states of negative norm on the daughter regge trajectories in the case of 4-dimensional space - time .",
    "nonetheless the state density of eq.([statedensity ] ) , particularly the exponential dependence , gives an order - of - magnitude estimate for the number of the j=0 states in the dual resonance model .",
    "hagedorn@xcite introduced a statistical model of hadrons with quite a different motivation .",
    "it is amusing that his model led to essentially the same state density with a very close value ( @xmath108160 mev ) for @xmath111 but with a slightly difference power of @xmath1 in front .",
    "in hagedorn s model , the closeness of @xmath111 to the pion mass was explained by the fact that every time energy increases by @xmath111 , one more pion evaporates and causes the exponential growth of the state density .",
    "the phenomenological success of the dual resonance model@xcite confirmed that the @xmath1-channel resonances are dual to the non - pomeron regge exchanges while the pomeron is dual to the nonresonant continuum in the @xmath1-channel@xcite .",
    "the dual resonance model at tree - level incorporates only the non - pomeron trajectories .",
    "the pomeron term was included by adding the two - body nonresonant intermediate states . at high energies , the resonant states are so broad in width that they are not recognized as resonances but make up the smooth regge asymptotic behavior of non - pomeron exchange .",
    "in the yet higher energy region , the diffractive scattering dominates so that the s - channel states consist almost entirely of nonresonant states .",
    "henceforth we shall call the @xmath1-channel states dual to the pomeron and to the non - pomerons as the nonresonant and the resonant channels , respectively , even though no resonance peak appears in the resonant channels at high energies .",
    "we shall also use the words , the diffractive and nondiffractive channels , for them . in the dual resonance model ,",
    "the effective number of the nonresonant channels is even larger than @xmath106 of the resonant channels in the high - energy limit .",
    "the distinction between the pomeron and the non - pomeron trajectories is best described by the quark diagram@xcite .",
    "( see figure 1 . )",
    "the non - pomeron exchange in the boson - boson scattering is described by a pair of quark - antiquark in the intermediate state ( fig.1a ) which represents a tower of resonances in the s - channel and at the same time the regge trajectory exchanges in the @xmath112-channel .",
    "in contrast , the pomeron exchange corresponds to the `` disconnected '' quark diagram of the @xmath113 four - quark intermediate states in the @xmath1-channel as shown in fig.1b . in the context of qcd one pair of @xmath114 exchanges relatively soft gluons with the other pair of @xmath114 in the pomeron exchange@xcite .",
    "this quark diagram not only ensures the exchange degeneracy for a pair of non - pomeron trajectories with opposite signatures , as observed in scattering experiment@xcite , but also explains the absence of the mesons with exotic quantum numbers such as @xmath115 in meson spectroscopy .      the t - invariance relation in section ii",
    "can be easily extended to the decay amplitude into the eigenchannels . using the completeness condition @xmath116 and @xmath117",
    ", we obtain @xmath118 where @xmath119 . accordingly the decay amplitude @xmath120 into the eigenchannel @xmath121 carries the eigenphase @xmath122 . inserting the complete set of eigenchannels and using the expansion of @xmath123",
    ", we obtain @xmath124 the decay amplitude @xmath125 for @xmath126 is now expressed in the terms of the eigenchannel decay amplitudes @xmath120 : @xmath127 separating the phase @xmath122 from @xmath120 as @xmath128 we put eq.([weakamp ] ) in the form @xmath129 comparing eq.([weakamp \" ] ) with eq.([scattering0 ] ) , we clearly see that the net phase of @xmath125 has little to do with that of @xmath92 .",
    "the phase of @xmath125 agrees with that of @xmath92 , barring an accident , only when there is only one eigenchannel so that the elastic unitarity holds , @xmath130 it was pointed out that the partial - wave projection of the diffraction amplitude for the @xmath131 scattering at the @xmath2 mass is far short of the unitarity limit@xcite ; @xmath132 . for the @xmath3 decay , which occurs near the resonance region or a little above it ,",
    "the nonleading regge terms can not be ignored in two - body scattering .",
    "we shall see in section v that even after adding the non - pomeron terms the elastic unitarity does not hold at the @xmath3 mass .",
    "the amplitude @xmath133 defined in eq.([weakamp ] ) still contains strong - interaction effects . to define the eigenchannel decay amplitude free of final - state interactions",
    ", we must separate out not only the phase correction but also the magnitude correction @xmath134 by @xmath135 .",
    "if all inelastic channels are approximated as two - body or quasi - two - body states , @xmath134 can be written in the omns - mushkelishvili representation : @xmath136 where @xmath137 stands for the principal value integral .",
    "one obvious property of @xmath134 is that it is positive definite . whether @xmath138 gives an enhancement ( @xmath139 ) or a suppression ( @xmath140 ) depends on the sign of @xmath122 for all values of @xmath1 from the threshold @xmath141 to @xmath142 , not just the on - shell value @xmath143 . in the nonresonant channels",
    ", we shall argue later that @xmath95 is small in magnitude and the sign of @xmath95 can be easily flipped as energy changes when a large number of channels mix .",
    "if so , a correlation of the magnitude correction @xmath138 with the on - shell phase value @xmath144 is tenuous , if any . with the magnitude enhancement factor written out , eq.([weakamp \" ] ) turns into @xmath145    for the resonant channels , one can compute the feynman diagram for the decay process @xmath146(resonance ) @xmath147(two - body ) through a resonance @xmath148 .",

    "experiment shows that the imaginary part dominates over the real part for the invariant amplitude @xmath157 of elastic scattering at high energies . theoretically , the dominance of im@xmath157 is a general consequence of analyticity and crossing symmetry , not specific to the regge theory , when the total cross section approaches a constant up to powers of @xmath158 .",

    "the smallness of re@xmath203/im@xmath203 for the diffractive scattering suggests that @xmath209 spreads over positive and negative values ( modulo @xmath210 ) in an approximately symmetric distribution with respect to @xmath211 .",
    "for such a distribution a large cancellation occurs among different eigenchannels in re@xmath212 while every term adds up in im@xmath213 .",

    "since even a small coupling strongly mixes a pair of degenerate states , any two - body state in the highly inelastic energy region is a linear combination of many eigenchannels .",
    "the expansion coefficients of a given state into eigenchannels , namely @xmath91 , is sensitive to the strength of channel couplings , but many features of physics , for instance @xmath95 , should not be sensitive to small variations of channel couplings .",

    "then , first of all , the phase of @xmath125 approaches a common limit in eq.([averagem ] ) independent of isospins or charge states of @xmath89 , say , @xmath266 and @xmath267 .",
    "the common limit does not depend on the effective weak interaction @xmath18 .",
    "this marked simplicity is valid only in the random phase limit . considering that im@xmath203 takes roughly the same value for all meson - meson scatterings ( cf .",
    "eq.([estimate ] ) ) , we expect the common decay phase is not very sensitive to the final hadrons .",
    "we have pointed out earlier that in the quasi - two - body approximation to the inelastic channels , @xmath134 is positive definite and uncorrelated with the on - shell @xmath122 .",
    "if this is the case , the terms of different eigenchannels cancel each other in im@xmath125 because of the random signs of @xmath268 : @xmath269 in contrast , all eigenchannels add up in the real part since @xmath270 in the restricted range of eq.([range ] ) .",
    "it is similar to the situation in the elastic scattering amplitude of eq.([scattering ] ) , but this time the cancellation occurs in the imaginary part instead of the real part . because of the deviation of @xmath271 from unity due to enhancement and suppression",
    ", the cancellation may not be as good as in the scattering .",
    "we can set with eqs.([averagem ] ) and ( [ averagedelta ] ) a loose upper bound on the imaginary - to - real ratio for @xmath125 . in terms of @xmath272 , it is given by was simply written as @xmath45 . ]",

    "therefore the actual value of the imaginary - to - real ratio is most likely much smaller than 0.4 . by pushing our approximation further ,",
    "let us set @xmath277 to a common number is not correlated with @xmath278 or @xmath140 , setting @xmath277 to a number independent is justifiable . ] and",

    "next we look into the contribution of the resonant channels to the decay phase .",
    "it falls like @xmath284 relative to the diffractive contribution .",
    "in addition to the @xmath285 suppression , the chiral structure of the weak interaction suppresses the transition from the initial state @xmath6 of @xmath286 to the resonant channels .",
    "let us examine this suppression .",
    "keeping in mind that in the dual resonance model the resonant channels are made of two - quark states in the quark diagram ( fig.1a ) , we examine the transition of @xmath287 to the resonant state @xmath288 . with minor modifications . ]",
    "the bare weak hamiltonian which causes the transition is the four - quark operator , @xmath289 where we have suppressed the dirac structure of the quark bilinears .",
    "the short - distance qcd corrections to @xmath18 induce the effective interactions such as @xmath290 and the penguin interaction @xmath291 .",
    "the weak transition @xmath146 is the so - called annihilation or exchange process .",
    "the matrix elements of the annihilation and exchange processes are suppressed by the decay constant @xmath292 of the meson @xmath6 and , for the non - penguin interactions , also by the factor @xmath293 of chirality mismatch on the side of @xmath148 . the suppression due to the first one ,",
    "@xmath294 , together with the energy dependence suppression @xmath285 or @xmath295 is severe enough to make the phase difference contribution of the resonant channels negligibly small .",
    "it should be reminded that the _ resonances _ in the resonant channels are so broad ( @xmath296 ) that no sharp resonance enhancement arises .",
    "the suppression of @xmath294 occurs for the transition @xmath146 through the penguin interaction too .    in short ,",
    "the dominant decay process is through the spectator diagrams which lead to @xmath113 not @xmath114 in the final state .",
    "the decay @xmath297 followed by a pair annihilation into @xmath114 is no other than the annihilation or exchange process , as we can see by drawing the diagram .",
    "the rescattering of @xmath113 without a @xmath114 annihilation is a diffactive process not a resonant one in the sense of the dual resonance model .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the decay phase due to the resonant channels are negligibly small .",
    "we estimate a typical magnitude of the phase differences of this origin as @xmath298 for the decay modes where the spectator process dominates .",
    "when the chiral mismatch occurs for @xmath148 , a decay matrix element is suppressed by the additional factor of @xmath299 .",
    "what we can measure in experiment is not the absolute phases but the phase differences .",
    "though the phase of @xmath300 is independent of the charge or isospin states of @xmath89 , the fluctuation around the average value can be isospin dependent and therefore generate phase differences .",
    "the physical origin of this type of phase differences can be explained as follows : a pair of decay amplitudes have different compositions of diffractive eigenchannels .",
    "therefore the interference between eigenchannels sums up to different net phases for the amplitudes .",
    "the phases of this origin are washed out in the random limit .",
    "the interference between the diffractive and nondiffractive eigenchannels is another possible source of the relative phases .",
    "we first examine the relative phase due to the fluctuations .",
    "the fluctuation is the standard deviation from the random phase limit of @xmath300 . averaging out the product of four @xmath91 in the phase space of o(n ) group for @xmath301 and @xmath302/(n-1)n(n+2)$ ] for @xmath303@xcite . ]",
    ", we obtain for @xmath304 @xmath305 where the brackets denote the averages such as @xmath306 the sum @xmath307 is the total rate for the decays induced by @xmath18 without strong interaction corrections . since the decay amplitude is dominantly real , the phase difference is more sensitive to @xmath308 than to @xmath309 .",
    "the relative magnitude of the standard deviation @xmath310 to the average @xmath311 depends on the channel number @xmath312 .",
    "if @xmath312 is nearly as large as the dual resonance model indicates , or even a small fraction of it , @xmath313 is negligibly small and no relative phase arises from fluctuations . in this case , the two - body channel couples to an enormous number of inelastic nonresonant channels though its couplings to individual channels are very weak accordingly .",
    "the fluctuations almost even out when this happens . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath312 is so small that @xmath314 is comparable to the branching fraction to the channel @xmath89 , @xmath308 can be close to @xmath315 itself . when @xmath311 is small by an accidental cancellation of high degree among different eigenchannels , the fluctuation can be large in proportion . to ensure that the random phase is a good approximation , therefore",
    ", we should apply its predictions only to the two - body modes having relatively large branching fractions .",
    "the phase differences arising from an interference with the resonant eigenchannels are suppressed by the chiral structure of the weak interaction operators and decrease like @xmath285 with energy .",
    "their contribution is of the order of @xmath316 as given in eq.([phasedifference ] ) in general .",
    "however , our argument fails in the modes where the spectator process is forbidden or highly suppressed . in such processes the diffractive eigenchannels dual to the pomeron are missing or highly suppressed so that large phases and phase differences may potentially arise .",
    "it is unfortunate that the decay branching is generally very small for them .",
    "we shall look into the specific cases of the d and b mesons with a few critical remarks on some of the recent attempts to compute the final - state interaction phases of the two - body decays of @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "the most prominent two - body decay of the d meson is the @xmath317 modes . from the observed decay rates of @xmath318 and @xmath319 ,",
    "the phase and magnitude of the decay amplitude were determined for @xmath320 of definite isospin .",
    "they discovered a large relative phase between the i=1/2 and 3/2 decay amplitudes@xcite ; @xmath321 with the amplitude ratio @xmath322 since the d meson mass is too low for the pomeron to dominate in the @xmath190 scattering , our argument in the preceding section does not apply with a good accuracy .",
    "the phases of the @xmath1-wave @xmath190 elastic scattering amplitudes @xmath323 at energy @xmath324 was computed with the regge theory and identified with the phases of the decay amplitudes for the @xmath190 isospin eigenstates .",
    "the result of calculation in ref.@xcite happens to be in a good agreement with the observed phase difference , eq.([phase ] ) , within the uncertainties in the values of the regge parameters .",
    "we argue however that such an agreement is fortuitous . in order to identify the scattering phases with the decay phases",
    ", the scattering must be elastic .",
    "the authors of ref@xcite computed only the phase difference of the @xmath190 amplitudes , not the magnitudes of them .",
    "if they had done so , they would have obtained @xmath325 they do not satisfy the elastic unitarity : @xmath326 and @xmath327 .",
    "the @xmath61 amplitude is deep inside the argand diagram while the @xmath328 amplitude nearly satisfies the elastic unitarity .",
    "actually , if one insists that @xmath190 scattering be elastic at @xmath329 , one can make @xmath330 unitary in a model - independent way . since the @xmath328 channel is exotic , _ i.e.",
    ", _ contains no @xmath1-channel resonances dual to the non - pomeron trajectories , the imaginary part of @xmath330 in eq.([unitary ] ) comes entirely from the pomeron .",
    "the non - pomeron trajectories can contribute only to the real part in the case of @xmath330 .",
    "therefore one should make up for the unitarity violation of @xmath330 by adjusting its real part : @xmath331 which gives @xmath332 unlike @xmath330 the unitarity deficit of @xmath333 is very large . to recover the elastic unitarity for @xmath333 , the pomeron daughters and the exchange - degenerate pairs of trajectories such as the daughters of @xmath238-@xmath239 and of @xmath334-@xmath335 must contribute just as much as or more than the parent trajectories .",
    "if so , the regge expansion itself would be unjustified at this energy .    in the @xmath61 channel",
    "there is an obvious candidate for a cause of inelasticity , that is , @xmath336 channel which should enter according to the flavor su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "then the @xmath337 involves at least two eigenchannels , the @xmath61 channels of the * 8 * and * 27 * representations of su(3 ) .",

    "many @xmath341 states are contained in @xmath338 , with which @xmath317 mixes in general .",
    "it is not surprising if many eigenchannels are open for both @xmath61 and @xmath62 already at the energy of the @xmath3 meson    is there any chance to identify the @xmath342 decay phase with the @xmath317 scattering phase all the way up to high energies despite the presence of inelastic channels ?",
    "we do not think so . in eq.([unitary ] ) the real part of @xmath343 is positive for @xmath61 and negative for @xmath328 at the @xmath3 meson mass .",
    "if it happens that @xmath333 and @xmath330 approach purely imaginary numbers at high energies , @xmath344 would turn counter clockwise to @xmath215 and @xmath345 would turn clockwise to @xmath216 .",
    "the phase - amplitude dispersion of section ii then requires that @xmath346 is enhanced over @xmath347 by factor @xmath348 , where @xmath349 is the highest energy up to which one is willing to make the identification of the decay phase with the scattering phase .",
    "this relative enhancement factor is far too large unless @xmath349 is chosen to be comparable to @xmath324 .",
    "to summarize , the d - meson mass is not low enough to allow identification of the final - interaction phase with the elastic scattering phase .",
    "yet it is not high enough for our random s - matrix approximation to work with a good accuracy . the large phase difference obtained by experimentalists can be accommodated but not predicted .",
    "the meson - meson scattering at energy @xmath350 is most likely asymptotic for @xmath131 , @xmath190 , @xmath351 or even for @xmath352 .",
    "the resonances exist only at much lower energies , which means that the contribution of the nondiffractive scattering , _",
    "i.e. , _ the non - pomeron exchanges , to the asymptotic scattering amplitude is negligible .",
    "for instance , if we make an estimate for the elastic @xmath190 scattering at energy @xmath353 using the regge parametrization of ref@xcite , the diffractive contribution gives @xmath354 the nondiffractive contributions modify it only slightly into @xmath355 and @xmath356 .",
    "the two - body scattering is clearly in the asymptotic energy region .",
    "the @xmath1-wave inelasticity for @xmath190 is @xmath357 from our estimate in eq.([estimate ] ) .",
    "there is no chance for the elastic approximation to work at this energy .",
    "the fact that the largest branching fractions observed in the @xmath2 decay are at the level of 1% is a clear evidence for the presence of very many open channels .",
    "the @xmath2 decay is the process where our results of section iv should apply best .",
    "we shall restate our predictions for the @xmath2 decay below .",
    "first of all , the two - body @xmath2 decay amplitudes should be dominantly real up to cp violation phases . according to our very crude estimate made in eq.([deltaestimate ] ) , the decay phases should be @xmath358 or smaller .",
    "the relative phases should be even smaller .",
    "as has already been pointed out , this is in a sharp contrast to the conclusion of the elastic approximation which predicts that the phase differences are small but the phases themselves are close to @xmath359 . though some of the existing literature reach the same or similar conclusions , our @xmath1-channel picture for the origin of the almost real decay amplitudes is quite different from and orthogonal to them .",
    "our phase - amplitude dispersion relation corroborates the smallness of the decay phases .",
    "up to the short - distance qcd corrections , the magnitude of the final - state interaction phase is independent of isospins in the first - order approximation .",
    "this small and common final - state interaction phase is the reason why the color suppression appears to hold well in the @xmath2-decay .    as for a phase difference between a pair of decay amplitudes ,",
    "the portion of the relative phase that arises from the first - order correction to the random phase limit is not calculable , but small when the channel number @xmath312 is large .",
    "the typical branching fraction for the two - body modes @xmath360 , where @xmath174 is @xmath361 , is somewhere between 0.1% and 1% while the inclusive nonleptonic branching due to @xmath362 should be close to 70% .",
    "therefore the effective number of open channels @xmath312 with this set of quantum numbers is a hundred or more . for the decay modes such as @xmath363 that have relatively large branching fractions , the randomness approximation gives reliable predictions while the phases of the suppressed decay modes such as @xmath364 can not be reliably predicted in this approximation .",
    "in other words , the phase of the @xmath365 amplitude can be large .",
    "the reason is that the two isospin amplitudes @xmath366 of @xmath365 nearly cancel each other in the @xmath367 combination , thus enhancing the phase fluctuation contributions .",
    "the relative phase which arises from the interference with the subdominant nondiffractive eigenchannels is negligibly small since the contribution of the nondiffractive channels is suppressed by @xmath368 . according to our estimate in eq.([phasedifference ] )",
    ", the phase difference of this origin is expected to be @xmath369 the phase difference due to the fluctuations is more important in comparison .",
    "we are unable to estimate the relative importance between the fluctuations and the short - distance effects to the phase differences .",
    "notable exceptions are the decay modes for which the annihilation or exchange process dominates . for example , the decay @xmath370 for which no spectator diagram can be drawn . in this case",
    "the decay proceeds only through @xmath371 in the picture of the dual resonance model .",
    "there are no diffractive eigenchannels in the @xmath1-channel for this mode .",
    "therefore the @xmath370 amplitude can have a large phase unlike the amplitude for the spectator - dominated mode @xmath372 .",
    "the rescattering from @xmath373 to the @xmath374 final state can occur through a @xmath114 pair exchange , namely , the non - pomeron exchange . by stretching the corresponding quark diagram out , however , we find that the this rescattering decay process is actually due to one of the annihilation diagrams .",
    "unfortunately the branching fraction is too small for such interesting decay modes .",
    "a reliable computation of the long - distance final - state interaction phases is nearly an impossible task .",
    "the elastic rescattering approximation is probably not viable even for the d decay .",
    "it is out of question for the b decay .",
    "nonetheless we are able to extract a few relevant pieces of information with the phase - magnitude dispersion relation and with the eigenphase analysis .",
    "the conclusion from the dispersion relation is rigorous while the argument based on the eigenphase shifts resorts to the random channel - mixing postulate and the dual resonance model .",
    "the complexity of long - distance strong interactions appears formidable if we try to go any step further along this line . it may be possible to reach essentially the same qualitative conclusions with more an intuitive qualitative reasoning@xcite",
    "we have tried in a way different from anybody else , maybe in a hard way .",

    "<S> we attempt to understand the final - state interaction in the two - body nonleptonic decay of a heavy particle for which many multibody ( @xmath0 ) decay channels are also open . </S>",
    "<S> no matter how many multibody channels couple to the two - body channels , the analyticity of the s - matrix relates the phase and the magnitude of the two - body decay amplitude through a dispersion relation . in general , however , the phase can not be determined by strong interactions alone . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion relation requires on a general ground that the final - state interaction phases be small for the two - body decay amplitudes when the initial particle is very heavy . </S>",
    "<S> we then analyze the final - state interaction phases in terms of the @xmath1-channel eigenstates of the s - matrix and obtain semiquantitative results applicable to the @xmath2 decay with a random s - matrix hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> we use the high - energy scattering data and the dual resonance model as a guide to the relevant aspects of strong interaction dynamics at long and intermediate distances . </S>"
