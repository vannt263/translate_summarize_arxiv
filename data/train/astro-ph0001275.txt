    "planetary systems are born in dusty circumstellar disks .",
    "once planets form , the circumstellar dust is thought to be continually replenished by collisions and sublimation ( and subsequent condensation ) of larger bodies such as asteroids , comets , and kuiper belt objects ( nakano 1988 ; backman & paresce 1993 ) .",
    "such debris disks have now been directly imaged around several nearby main sequence stars : @xmath2 pictoris , hr 4796a , vega , fomalhaut and @xmath3 eridani ( holland et al .",
    "1998 ; jayawardhana et al .",
    "1998 ; koerner et al . 1998",
    "; greaves et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the presence of debris disks around stars which , in some cases , may be @xmath4 - @xmath5 years old suggests that an appreciable amount  perhaps tens of lunar masses  of dust may be present even in mature planetary systems .",
    "the ring of dust recently imaged at 850@xmath1 m around the nearby k2v star @xmath3 eridani is also spatially analogous to the kuiper belt of our own solar system ( greaves et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the g8v star 55 cancri , at a distance of 13 pc , is unique in having both planets as well as a substantial dust disk .",
    "it contains one planet of about 2 jupiter masses in an orbit with a semi - major axis of 0.11 au ( butler et al . 1997 ) and evidence for a second planet at several au in the form of a residual drift in the stellar velocity over the past 10 years ( marcy & butler 1998 ) .",
    "the dust disk , first inferred by dominik et al .",
    "( 1998 ) using iso observations at 25@xmath1 m and 60@xmath1 m , is much larger , with a radius of @xmath0 50 au .",
    "recent near - infrared coronographic observations of trilling & brown ( 1998 ) have resolved the 55 cancri dust disk and confirm that it extends to at least 40 au ( 3.24  ) from the star .",
    "we have recently commenced a mini - survey of the parent stars of known extrasolar planets using the submillimeter common user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) .",
    "our program is to obtain 850@xmath1 m and 450@xmath1 m flux measurements in the photometry mode since the expected disk sizes are too small to be spatially resolved at present .",
    "our goals are to explore the kinship between circumstellar dust and planets and to provide significant constraints on the nature and amount of dust associated with the kuiper belts of these extrasolar planetary systems . here",
    "we report the detection of sub - millimeter emission from 55 cnc during the first observing shift our survey program .",
    "we observed 55 cnc with the scuba instrument ( holland et al .",
    "1999 ) on the jcmt on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the data were obtained on 1999 february 4 - 9 ut using the scuba photometry mode .",
    "although scuba operates at 450 and 850@xmath1 m simultaneously , the observing conditions are generally poorer at the shorter wavelength .",
    "zenith atmospheric opacities were exceptionally good at 850@xmath1 m , ranging from 0.10 to 0.15 .",
    "observations of uranus were used for calibrations .",
    "pointing accuracy was 2  , which is small compared with the beam size of 15  at 850@xmath1 m ( fwhm ) and 8  at 450@xmath1 m .",
    "the data were reduced using the scuba user reduction facility ( jenness & lightfoot 1998 ) .",
    "we also obtained mid - infrared observations of 55 cnc on 1999 may 3 ut using the oscir instrument on the keck ii telescope .",
    "oscir is a mid - infrared imager / spectrometer built at the university of florida , using a 128@xmath6128 si : as blocked impurity band ( bib ) detector developed by boeing . on keck ii",
    ", oscir has a plate scale of 0.062/pixel , providing a 7.9@xmath67.9  field of view .",
    "we used a chop frequency of 4 hz and a throw of 8  .",
    "images were obtained in n(10.8 @xmath1 m ) and ihw18(18.2 @xmath1 m ) filters , with on - source integration times of 120 sec and 300 sec , respectively .",
    "the standard stars @xmath1 uma and @xmath7 boo were used for flux calibration .    in the sub - millimeter",
    ", we measure 2.8@xmath80.5 mjy at 850@xmath1 m and 7.9@xmath84.2 mjy at 450@xmath1 m from 55 cnc , presumably due to thermal emission of dust in a kuiper belt - like population . in the mid - infrared , where the emission is dominated by the stellar photosphere",
    ", we measure 1.0@xmath80.1 jy at 10.8@xmath1 m and 280@xmath828 mjy at 18.2@xmath1 m .",
    "the mid - infrared images do not show any evidence for spatial extension .",
    "this is not surprising given that 55 cnc has little or no excess above the photosphere at these wavelengths .",
    "table 1 lists all available mid - infrared to sub - millimeter flux measurements and limits from our observations , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "following backman & gillett ( 1987 ) , we can write the fractional luminosity of dust as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the luminosities of the dust debris and the star , respectively . for 55 cnc , based on its far - infrared excesses , @xmath14 , some two orders of magnitude lower than that of the debris disk prototype @xmath2 pictoris .",
    "figure 1 shows that a single - temperature blackbody can match the far - infrared and sub - millimeter flux measurements of 55 cnc quite well .",
    "if one assumes that the emission at @xmath15 25@xmath1 m is primarily due to the stellar photosphere , a @xmath16 k blackbody fits the iso 60@xmath1 m measurement and the scuba 450 and 850@xmath1 m detections .",
    "it is also roughly consistent with the iso 90@xmath1 m limit .",
    "figure 1 also includes a modified blackbody fit with @xmath17 k and @xmath180.5 , where @xmath19 , for comparison .",
    "this can fit the 60@xmath1 m and sub - millimeter points well , but does not meet the iso 90@xmath1 m constraint .",
    "a blackbody temperature of 100 k for the grains suggests that the dust disk around 55 cnc has a central disk hole with a minimum radius of 13 au",
    ". if the dust temperature is closer to 60 k , the hole could be as large as 35 au .",
    "this would not conflict significantly with the coronograph image of trilling & brown ( 1998 ) where reliably detected emission begins at @xmath0 27 au from the star .",
    "thus , the 55 cnc dust disk is likely to be well outside the orbits of the two known planets in the system .",
    "since @xmath2=0 corresponds to large grains and @xmath2=1 to small grains for optically thin emission , our best - fit to the data in figure 1 would imply a population of grains with @xmath20 .    to better constrain the disk parameters using data at all wavelengths",
    ", we used the model discussed by dent et al .",
    "calculations are made with a 2-d continuum radiative transfer code which includes the star and a thin disk with inner and outer boundaries @xmath21 , and a power - law mid - plane density @xmath22 .",
    "the dust emission is characterized by a single characteristic grain size @xmath23 , a critical wavelength @xmath24 and an opacity index @xmath2 ; shortwards of @xmath24 the grains act as blackbodies while longwards the emissivity is given by @xmath25 .",
    "we have assumed the @xmath26 power - law density distribution derived from the near - infrared observations also continues down to the inner radius @xmath27 . for 55 cnc , the best fit model ( figure  2 ) has @xmath27 of 10 au , a grain size @xmath23 = 100 @xmath1 m and opacity index @xmath28 .",
    "both the simple fit and model are roughly consistent with the iso 90 @xmath1 m upper limit , although the lower @xmath2 may provide a better fit to this data .",
    "the model indicates an upper limit to the dust density in the region 3au@xmath2910au of @xmath3010% of the density at 10au , thus the region where planets are detected is significantly depleted of dust .",
    "since the sub - millimeter flux is less sensitive to the temperature of the grains than the infrared flux , we can use it to estimate the dust mass .",
    "following jura et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , the dust mass @xmath31 is given by      if @xmath33 denotes the distance from the sun to 55 cnc . assuming a dust absorption coefficient @xmath34 between 1.7 and 0.4 @xmath35 g@xmath36 at 850@xmath1 m ( greaves et al .",
    "1998 ) , we obtain a dust mass of 0.0008 - 0.005 earth masses , for @xmath37= 100 - 130 k. the lower value of @xmath34 is suggested by models of large , icy grains ( pollack et al .",
    "1994 ) , while the higher estimate has been used for previous observations of debris disks ( holland et al .",
    "however , as for all the extrasolar debris disks , very large grains could dominate the total mass while adding little submillimeter emission , so our mass estimates only provide lower limits .",
    "our dust mass estimates are consistent with dominik et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who derive @xmath38 by fitting a disk model to the iso and iras data . on the other hand , using a low albedo ( near - infrared reflectance of 6% ) and an average particle density of 1 g @xmath39 , trilling & brown ( 1998 )",
    "estimate a dust mass of 0.4 @xmath40 in the 55 cnc disk from their scattered light observations .",
    "their estimate is inconsistent with ours .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy is not clear .",
    "one possibility is that trilling & brown ( 1998 ) may have overestimated the disk brightness in the near - infrared due to difficulties in background subtraction .",
    "the amount of dust in our solar system s kuiper belt is not well determined .",
    "based on far - infrared observations of @xmath41 and @xmath9 , backman , dasgupta & stencel ( 1995 ) and stern ( 1996 ) have placed an upper limit of 10@xmath42 on the kuiper belt mass in the form of dust ( particles with @xmath43 1 cm ) . however , teplitz et al . ( 1999 ) show that the dust mass could be as high as @xmath44 depending on assumptions about albedo , distribution in particle size , contribution of foreground and background sources to the far - infrared emission , etc .",
    "thus , the 55 cnc disk may be somewhat `` dustier '' than our kuiper belt .",
    "it also appears somewhat `` over - dusty '' for 55 cnc s stellar age of @xmath0 5 gyr ( gonzalez & vanture 1998 ; baliunas et al .",
    "1997 ) , when compared to dust masses in the handful of nearby , well - studied debris disks .",
    "trilling & brown ( 1998 ) suggest that the apparent dust mass excess in 55 cnc is consistent with the idea that the inner planet migrated toward the star from its birthplace ( trilling et al .",
    "1998 ; murray et al .",
    "1998 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "a planet migrates inward by exchanging angular momentum with a circumstellar disk which initially extends to a few stellar radii .",
    "this migration could transfer material from the inner part of the disk to the outer part , enhancing the mass at kuiper belt distances .",
    "if that is true , other extrasolar planetary systems with `` hot jupiter '' planets should also harbor appreciable amounts of dust in their outer regions .",
    "we expect to test this prediction during our on - going sub - millimeter survey of parent stars of radial - velocity planets .",
    "the radiation field of a g8 star is generally too weak to expel dust grains by radiation pressure . in the case of 55 cnc ,",
    "the poynting - robertson timescale is much shorter than the estimated @xmath05-gyr age of the star ( dominik et al .",
    "1998 ) . therefore",
    ", the dust grains in the system must be replenished by collisions or sublimation of larger bodies such as asteroids , comets , and kuiper belt objects .",
    "in summary , we have detected sub - millimeter thermal emission from dust in the 55 cnc planetary system .",
    "our results confirm that state - of - the - art sub - millimeter instruments are able to detect continuum emission from even a relatively small amount of dust surrounding nearby sun - like stars .",
    "the observed dust mass in the 55 cnc system appears to be somewhat higher than that associated with the kuiper belt in our solar system .",
    "far - infrared observations from the _ space infrared telescope facility _ and the _ stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy _ as well as detailed modeling will be crucial for reliably constraining the spatial extent , size distribution and composition of the dust .",
    "we are grateful to charles telesco , scott fisher and robert pia for their assistance with the oscir observations at keck .",
    "we also wish to thank the staff of jcmt and keck for their outstanding support .",
