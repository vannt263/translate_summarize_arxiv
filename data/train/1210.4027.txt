    "recently , the new generation of wide - field survey projects , such as the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs-1 ) @xcite and the palomar transient factory ( ptf ) @xcite , have carried out searches for supernovae without an inherent galaxy bias .",
    "@xcite identified a class of hydrogen - poor `` super - luminous supernovae ( slsne ) '' with typical @xmath14band absolute magnitudes of around @xmath15 , which is 10 to 100 times brighter than normal core - collapse sne .",
    "their intrinsic brightness has allowed them to be discovered in the pan - starrs1 survey between @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied one of the closest examples , sn  2010gx ( @xmath2 ) , in detail showing it to transition to a normal type ic sn at 40 days after peak , while multi - colour photometry rules out @xmath7ni as powering the peak magnitude .",
    "two physical mechanisms for sn  2010gx ( and the supernovae like it from @xcite ) have been proposed .",
    "one is that the type ic sn is boosted in luminosity by energy deposition from magnetar spin down @xcite .",
    "the second is the shock breakout through a dense wind @xcite , or shock - interaction of the sn ejecta with massive c - o shells @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that most slsne tend to occur in star - forming dwarf galaxies , which have high specific star formation rates .",
    "their intrinsic rate is @xmath17mpc@xmath18year@xmath19 ; or @xmath20 of the normal core - collapse sn rate @xcite .",
    "however beyond this we lack information on their explosion sites and what the progenitor star population may be .",
    "an important question is whether or not the apparent preference they have for dwarf host galaxies is related to requiring low metallicity progenitor stars . as low metallicity affects stellar structure and evolution through changes in stellar winds , opacity and rotation , quantitative measurements are required . in this letter",
    "we study the host galaxy of one of the nearest slsne , sn  2010gx , and search for evidence of late emission from radioactive @xmath7ni decay .",
    "we used gemini south and north observatories with gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) to collect @xmath8 photometry between @xmath6 days after the maximum of sn  2010gx ( table1 ) . to check for the presence of residual supernova flux at @xmath21 days after peak , we aligned and rescaled all images to the same pixel grid using iraf / geomap and geotran packages and made the assumption that the final image taken in january 2012 only contains flux from the host galaxy .",
    "we performed imaging subtraction using the high order transform of psf and template subtraction ( hotpants ) software , to subtract the january 2012 images from the earlier epochs .",
    "the host galaxy subtracts off almost perfectly and no sn signal is detected . to determine a limiting magnitude for the sn flux in the three epochs",
    ", we added 6 fake stars , one at the supernova position and five within a surrounding radius of 0.6 arcmin to each of the @xmath21 days images .",
    "we ran this procedure multiple times with a range of fake star magnitudes and repeated image subtraction with hotpants .",
    "we determined @xmath22 and @xmath23 detection limits by requiring that we could visually detect a fake sn exactly at the position of sn  2010gx and that the measured standard deviation of the set of fake stars added was 0.2 and 0.3 magnitudes respectively .",
    "the resulting upper limits are in table1 .    the apparent magnitudes ( sdss ab system ) of the host galaxy , sdss j112546.72 - 084942.0 , are @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "these were obtained from aperture photometry ( within iraf / daophot ) on the best seeing images , using a zero - point calibration achieved with 10 sdss reference stars .",
    "as deep , pre - explosion images of the host galaxy were not available , we compared our photometry results to both sdss catalog magnitudes , and our own photometry performed on the sdss images . in the @xmath14band , the sdss catalog petrosian magnitude for the object is @xmath28 , while we measure @xmath29 mag in the sdss image .",
    "the large uncertainty is due to the marginal detection .",
    "our deep gemini image shows the host resolved from a fainter neighbouring galaxy ( which is unresolved from the host in sdss ) .",
    "if we use a large aperture on our gemini @xmath14band image , to include flux from the neighbouring galaxy then we obtain @xmath30 mag . within the uncertainties ,",
    "the sdss and gemini magnitudes are similar and there is no hint that the @xmath31 days gemini images are brighter than the sdss images and contain sn flux .",
    "long slit spectroscopy of sn  2010gx was carried out on 5 june 2010 @xcite with the gemini south telescope + gmos .",
    "the b600 grating ( i d @xmath32 ) was used ( 1800s exposure ) to obtain a spectral coverage in the observer frame of @xmath33  ( henceforth referred to as the `` blue spectrum '' ) .",
    "although this spectrum contains flux from sn  2010gx , we fitted a high order polynomial ( order 15 ) through the sn continuum and subtracted off this contribution leaving a flat spectrum for which emission lines between @xmath34  could be measured .",
    "we could not measure the h@xmath35 line in this spectrum as it was contaminated by a strong sky line and slit nodding was not employed .",
    "a second spectrum was obtained on 23 dec .",
    "2011 with gmos at the gemini north telescope , using the r400 grating ( i d @xmath36 ; @xmath37s exposures ) , to cover @xmath38  ( henceforth referred to as the red spectrum ) .",
    "the use of an order - blocking filter ( @xmath39 ) truncated the wavelength coverage in the blue .",
    "detrending of the data , such as bias - subtraction , was established using standard techniques within iraf .",
    "for the red spectra , individual exposures were nodded along the slit , and we used two - dimensional image subtraction to remove the sky background .",
    "the spectra were wavelength calibrated using daytime arcs ( cuar lamp ) and flux calibrated with the spectrophotometric standard feige 34 .    for both red and blue spectra ,",
    "a @xmath40 slit was used , yielding a resolution ( as measured from narrow night sky lines ) of @xmath41  in the red , and @xmath42  in the blue .",
    "the combined blue and red spectra provide spectral coverage between 4300 and 8500and the overlap region was used to ensure a uniform flux calibration .",
    "three strong lines ( [ oiii ] @xmath43 , [ oiii ] @xmath44 , and h@xmath45 ) lie within the overlap region .",
    "we measured the line fluxes in both spectra and applied a linear scaling to bring the blue spectrum into agreement with the red .",
    "the line fluxes of these three lines agreed to within @xmath46 after this rescaling .",
    "line flux measurements were made after fitting a polynomial function to subtract the continuum , and fig.3 shows the final combined spectrum of the host galaxy with this continuum subtracted .",
    "we fitted gaussian line profiles within a custom built idl environment , fixing the full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the mean of the three strong lines ; 6.03  and 4.45  for the red and blue spectra respectively ( see table2 ) .",
    "we further normalized the spectrum and determined the equivalent width of each feature .",
    "the uncertainty estimation is calculated using the expression from @xcite , derived from the equivalent width of the line and the rms of the continuum ( also listed in table2 ) .",
    "the fact that sn  2010gx was not detected after the host galaxy image subtraction at epochs between @xmath47 and @xmath48 days allows us to determine an upper limit for the mass of @xmath7ni ejected .",
    "this is somewhat uncertain as it relies on assuming that the gamma ray trapping in sn  2010gx behaves like in other ic sne in the nebular phase , and the late luminosity is directly proportional to the mass of @xmath7co present at any epoch .",
    "we measured sn  2010gx fluxes at the effective rest wavelength of the @xmath49 filters and used a luminosity distance of 1114.7mpc ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "we determined the upper limit of the luminosities and compared with sn  1998bw@xcite , a ic sn with a high @xmath7ni mass , in johnson @xmath51 and cousins @xmath52 in the rest frame ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the most interesting measurement is the @xmath53band limit for sn  2010gx flux at @xmath47 days , which is significantly below what we would expect if sn  1998bw were at this distance . if we take @xmath54 as the representative @xmath7ni mass for sn  1998bw @xcite , then the flux limit of sn  2010gx ( 0.8 that of sn  1998bw ; fig.2 ) , suggests an upper limit of about @xmath55 of @xmath7ni ejected by sn  2010gx .",
    "we carried out an abundance analysis of the host galaxy based on the determination of the electron temperature , and detection of the [ oiii ] @xmath5 auroral line ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "firstly , the emission line fluxes were reddening corrected using the @xcite milky way law of a@xmath56e(@xmath57 ) .",
    "we assumed case b recombination which requires an intrinsic line ratio of h@xmath35/h@xmath58 and h@xmath59/h@xmath60 at t@xmath61k @xcite .",
    "the observed ratio of h@xmath35/h@xmath62 yields an extinction coefficient c(h@xmath45)@xmath63 , which we used to calculate reddening - corrected line fluxes .",
    "the observed line fluxes and errors are listed in table2 .",
    "we confidently detected the [ oiii ] @xmath5 auroral line ( s / n@xmath41 ) in the gmos spectrum ( see fig.3 ) , allowing us to estimate the electron temperature and calculate the oxygen abundance directly .",
    "as in @xcite , we used a custom - written pyraf script based on the iraf / nebula package .",
    "the direct method of estimating oxygen abundances uses the ratio of the intensities of [ oiii ] @xmath44 , @xmath43/[oiii ] @xmath5 lines to determinate the electron temperature ( t@xmath64 ) in the ionized gas region .",
    "we find an oxygen abundance of @xmath65 dex , remarkably low even for dwarf galaxies ( see fig.3 ) . assuming a solar value of @xmath66 dex",
    ", this implies that the host galaxy is 1.2 dex below solar abundance or just @xmath67 .",
    "the reddening - corrected , and @xmath68corrected flux of h@xmath35 is @xmath69 ( ergs@xmath19@xmath70 ) , from which we determined the star formation rate ( sfr ) of the host to be @xmath71year@xmath19 from the calibration of : sfr ( @xmath10year@xmath19)@xmath72 10@xmath73 l(h@xmath35 ) ( ergss@xmath19 ) .",
    "we also estimated the sfr from the [ oii ] @xmath74 line flux , which gives @xmath75year@xmath19 and is consistent with h@xmath35 measurement .",
    "@xcite used [ oii ] @xmath74 to estimate the sfr of the ultra - luminous ps1 - 12bam host , which at @xmath76 has h@xmath35 shifted to the nir .",
    "the agreement between the sfr estimates from [ oii ] @xmath74 and h@xmath35 for the host of sn  2010gx supports [ oii ] @xmath74 being reliable for these types of galaxies at higher redshift .",
    "we detected the galaxy ism absorption of the mg ii @xmath77  doublet in the gemini spectrum of 1 apr .",
    "2010 @xcite .",
    "the equivalent widths are @xmath78 and @xmath79  respectively , giving a ratio @xmath80 .",
    "the strength of the line @xmath81 component is comparable with that seen toward grb lines of site and somewhat higher than observed for ps1 - 12bam @xcite .",
    "the fact that the line ratio is significantly smaller than 2 ( the ratio of their oscillator strengths ) suggests we are not on the linear regime , nor the square root regime on the curve of growth which prevents further use of the lines as physical diagnostics .",
    "nevertheless the absorption line strengths are similar to ps1 - 12bam and grb sightlines .",
    "the line centroids give identical redshifts ( @xmath82 ) to the [ oiii ] emission lines ( @xmath83 ) detected in the same spectrum , giving reassurance that the mg ii absorption does arise in the host .",
    "the @xmath14band absolute magnitude of the host galaxy is @xmath3 ( adopting a hubble constant of h@xmath84kms@xmath19mpc@xmath19 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , to obtain the luminosity distance 1114.7 mpc ;",
    "@xcite ) , applying the milky way extinction of 0.13 @xcite ) , a k - correction @xmath87 @xcite and a correction for internal dust extinction of @xmath88 mag .",
    "the latter comes from the measured intrinsic h@xmath35/h@xmath45 ratio and assuming @xmath89 ( applicable for an lmc environment ; @xcite ) @xcite . ]",
    "the observed photometric @xmath90 , @xmath91 colour terms were corrected for milky way extinction @xcite and used to fit the sed of a stellar population model @xcite .",
    "we used the low - metallicity ( z@xmath92 ) models , assuming a salpeter initial mass function with red horizontal branch morphology .",
    "the measured colours give reasonable agreement with a population model of age between 20 to 30 myr , and a stellar mass around @xmath93 .",
    "we also employed the magphys galaxy sed models of @xcite .",
    "fig.1 shows the observed sed and the redshifted magphys best - fit model spectrum : total stellar mass of @xmath94 and hence a specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) of @xmath95year@xmath19 .",
    "it has already been demonstrated that the peak luminosity of super - luminous sne such as sn  2010gx can not be due to @xmath7ni @xcite .",
    "chomiuk et al .",
    "illustrated that applying arnett s rule @xcite , results in an unphysical solution , with the mass of @xmath7ni exceeding the total c+o ejecta mass .",
    "our search for a luminous tail phase in sn  2010gx was not motivated by what powers the peak luminosity , rather it is to determine if there is any sign of radioactive @xmath7co at this stage and any similarity to @xmath7ni - rich ic sne such as sn  1998bw .",
    "the only robust conclusion we can draw is that there is unlikely to be any excessive mass of @xmath7co above and beyond about @xmath55 . at a similar phase , sn",
    "2010gx is fainter than sn  1998bw as shown in fig.2 .",
    "this limit on the late luminosity will also allow restrictions on the magnetar models of @xcite when put in context with other super - luminous supernovae of similar types ( inserra et al . in prep ) .",
    "our detection of the [ oiii ] @xmath5 auroral line gives confidence to our measurement of the remarkably low metallicity of @xmath65 dex ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "in fig.3 we show a compilation of other dwarf galaxies with the [ oiii ] @xmath5 direct method measurements , including four grb hosts from @xcite .",
    "the host of sn  2010gx is on the lower end and is amongst the lowest metallicity dwarf galaxies known .",
    "it has been clear from the early discoveries of these sne at @xmath96 @xcite , that the hosts are faint dwarf galaxies and @xcite showed that they have high ssfrs . if the extremely low value we determine is a common factor amongst these sne then it will be a major constraint on the progenitor channel .",
    "the magnetar scenario suggested by @xcite to explain these sne may benefit from low metallicity progenitors .",
    "massive stars rotate more rapidly at smc metallicity ( @xmath97 ) than solar ( hunter et al . 2008 ; martayan et al .",
    "2007 ) , although @xmath67 is unexplored territory .",
    "evolutionary models of rotating stars have focused attention on low metallicity environments as mass - loss is reduced hence angular momentum loss is lower .",
    "the energy input required from a magnetar requires the neutron star to be both highly magnetic ( @xmath98 g ) and rotating rapidly at formation ( @xmath99ms ) .",
    "it must also occur in a wolf - rayet or carbon - oxygen star , since there is no sign of hydrogen in the spectra of sn  2010gx or any similar sne .",
    "@xcite gives an estimated relative rate of the number of 2010gx - like sne compared to the total core - collapse sn rate of @xmath20 .",
    "if the progenitor channel requires low metallicity ( as we measure ) , high mass ( to produce a wc star ) and fast rotation ( to produce a rapidly rotating magnetar ) then this very low rate may not be unexpected .",
    "estimate that @xmath1001% of the star formation in the local universe ( @xmath101 ) is in galaxies with @xmath102 ; around 13% of massive stars above the sn threshold of @xmath103 are @xmath13 ( assuming a salpeter imf ) ; and about 10% of o - stars in the smc rotate faster than @xmath100300kms@xmath19 .",
    "one can speculate that all of these three conditions are required to produce the rate of the 2010gx - like sne and the estimated rate ( which is itself uncertain ) would be qualitatively reproduced .",
    "the high - mass requirement could also be substituted for an interacting binary system which causes spin - up in the co - core that collapses , similar to the proposed grb systems .",
    "the @xcite scenario of interaction with a dense wind would probably require extreme progenitor mass and pulsational mass - loss .",
    "the fact that we see wolf - rayet stars at very low metallicity ( e.g. in izw13 at @xmath104 ) @xcite could suggest that pulsational mass - loss is more prevalent at low metallicity .",
    "this one measurement is intriguing new information on these extreme sne but further measurements of the metallicity , star formation rate and volumetric rates of these supernovae are required to constrain their explosion channels further .",
