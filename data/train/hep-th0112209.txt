    "the asymptotic critical behavior , characterized by universal quantities ( exponents and amplitude combinations ) , is now theoretically well established @xcite with accuracy @xcite .",
    "however , the comparison of the theoretical results with experimental or numerical data is made easier when the theoretical expressions are extended into regimes where the asymptotic pure scaling breaks down @xcite ( calculations done far away from the critical point , characterized by nonuniversalities and including eventually crossover phenomena , see reviews @xcite ) .",
    "this extension has appeared necessary notably when measurements on colloids @xcite , but also on complex systems such as ionic fluids @xcite or polymers @xcite , seemed to yield strong nonuniversalities in approaching the critical point .",
    "indeed theoretical studies have suggested that , in some cases , those nonuniversalities could be due to a phenomenon of `` retarded criticality '' which characterizes measurements done outside the asymptotic critical domain @xcite .",
    "several recent theoretical ( and/or numerical ) studies have as well explicitly considered the evolution of effective exponents with emphasis on their monotonic or non - monotonic character @xcite .",
    "furthermore the description of the classical - to - critical crossover for ising systems is not yet clear - cut @xcite . for these reasons and because our preceding determination of nonasymptotic critical behavior from field theory @xcite did not yield continuous functions covering an entire crossover region , it seems to us useful to consider again those calculations in order to ( see also @xcite ) :    1 .",
    "extend them to a complete account of the classical - to - critical crossover which characterizes the framework of field theory @xcite , 2 .",
    "include the seventh order series for the critical exponents determined by murray and nickel @xcite in order to account as closely as possible for the up - to - date estimates of universal asymptotic critical quantities ( exponents and amplitude combinations ) provided by guida and zinn - justin @xcite ( referred to in the following as gz ) .    in the previous work @xcite , and contrary to an initial attempt @xcite regarding the homogeneous phase ( @xmath1 ) , we provided only continuous expressions of @xmath3 valid for @xmath4 ( @xmath3 is the temperature - like scaling field which is proportional to the absolute value of the reduced critical temperature @xmath5 ) .",
    "the crossover was not completely described because it was thought at that time that the field theoretical framework had a range of validity strictly limited to the first correction to scaling term .",
    "consequently , the practical limit of physical validity of the functions was imposed by the range of @xmath3 where the second correction to scaling term specific to field theory becomes non negligible and this occurs @xcite about @xmath6 .",
    "since then , it has appeared that the range of validity of field theory could be much larger than that and even could cover the entire classical - to - critical crossover region @xcite that it describes .",
    "somehow it is interesting to give expressions valid in the entire crossover region if only because it may be compared to other kinds of classical - to - critical crossovers either experimental @xcite or from numerical studies @xcite which , under some particular conditions , are identical @xcite to the field theoretical form ( but see also our comment in @xcite ) .    for technical reasons , in the preceding work @xcite we did not constrain our theoretical expressions to include very closely the estimates of universal asymptotic critical quantities of that time ( with their error bars ) so that uncertainties were underestimated and then our estimates of the correction amplitude ratios were , presumably , also not firmly determined . moreover small errors existed in the preceding study of the inhomogeneous phase @xcite ( as indicated elsewhere @xcite ) which have been eliminated from the present work ( nevertheless , we have explicitly verified ( see fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the errors have had no important consequence on the final results as it could be clearly deduced from a comparison of our estimates of universal amplitude - combinations @xcite with those of guida and zinn - justin @xcite ) .",
    "as in the preceding work @xcite , and using the same resummation method , we have considered the correlation length @xmath7 ( in the homogeneous phase @xmath8 for the @xmath0-vector model with @xmath91 to 3 ) , the susceptibility @xmath10 and the specific heat @xmath11 ( in the homogeneous phase @xmath8 with @xmath91 to 3 and in the inhomogeneous phase @xmath12 with @xmath91 ) and the coexistence curve ( spontaneous magnetization ) @xmath13 ( in the inhomogeneous phase with @xmath91 ) .    for practical reasons , it is useful to fix our notations relative to the actual asymptotic critical behaviors ( i.e. , in terms of the physical variable @xmath14 instead of @xmath15 , see also section [ useof ] ) :    [ eq : notat ] @xmath16 \\label{eq : notata } \\\\ \\chi \\left ( \\tau \\right ) & = & \\gamma ^{\\pm } \\;|\\tau |^{-\\gamma } \\left [ 1+a_{\\chi } ^{\\pm } \\;|\\tau |^{\\delta } + o\\left ( |\\tau |^{2\\delta } \\right ) \\right ]   \\label{eq : notatb }",

    "one usually restricts the consideration of the critical singularities to small values of latexmath:[$t\\propto    obtention of nonasymptotic critical behavior supposes the explicit consideration of non - necessarily small values of @xmath3    let us suppose that we want to calculate the susceptibility @xmath33 as function of the ( non - necessarily small ) temperature - like scaling field @xmath3 .",
    "calculations of such a nonasymptotic critical behavior from ( the massive ) field theory ( in three dimensions ) @xcite present the following features ( additional details may also be found elsewhere @xcite ) :    1 .",
    "the function @xmath10 is primarily performed under the implicit form because the quantities @xmath33 and @xmath3 are primarily given as perturbation series in powers of the renormalized coupling parameter @xmath34 ( up to fifth @xcite or sixth @xcite order ) : the functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 are resummed for @xmath34 varying in the range @xmath37 0,g^{*}\\right [ $ ] where @xmath38 is the zero of the wilson function ( or the `` @xmath18-function '' ) @xmath39 also primarily given as power series of @xmath34 ( up to sixth order @xcite ; @xmath38 is the fixed point value of @xmath34 ) .",
    "[ fit]the consideration of discontinuous values of @xmath34 is a compelling need of the numerical resummation procedure . consequently fitting an ad hoc function of @xmath3 to the calculated points",
    "eliminates the auxiliary variable @xmath34 and provides us with the final expression of @xmath40 as the explicit continuous function of @xmath3 we are looking for in the range @xmath41 0,+\\infty \\right [ $ ] .",
    "the actual calculation of the quantities of interest [ like @xmath35 ] for values of @xmath34 close to @xmath38 , at which point they are singular ( due to the critical singularity we expect to closely reproduce ) , requires expressing them under an integral representation like : @xmath43    \\label{eq : integrale}\\ ] ] in which @xmath44 and @xmath45 are not singular at @xmath38 and are primarily given as power series of @xmath34 ( up to seventh order @xcite ) .",
    "especially , @xmath46 and @xmath47 provide the field theoretical estimates of the critical exponents @xmath19 and @xmath20 . only the elementary series @xmath48 , @xmath45 and @xmath49",
    "are resummed using the sophisticated method mentioned in the following step [ the value @xmath50 is chosen small enough to allow a direct simple summation of the series @xmath51 .",
    "[ leroy]to sum perturbation series like @xmath44 , @xmath45 or @xmath49 for a given value of @xmath34 a borel  leroy transformation is used , combined with a conformal mapping .",
    "an estimation of the error is deduced from the observation of the convergence properties of the series when varying the free parameters of the transformation .",
    "this leads us to fixe those parameters ( resummation criteria ) in such a way as to obtain a combination of the error bounds on e.g. , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath49 which gives a kind of envelope for @xmath52 via two functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( and similarly for @xmath36 ) .",
    "since the critical singularities are similar in the two phases of the transition , the calculations in the inhomogeneous phase ( @xmath12 ) do not require the consideration of new series for the exponents compared to the homogeneous phase ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "hence the same three series @xmath48 , @xmath45 and @xmath49 express the critical singularities via integrals similar to that given in ( [ eq : integrale ] ) , only new critical amplitude functions of @xmath34 ( hence not singular at @xmath38 ) must be calculated @xcite and summed using the transformation mentioned in step [ leroy ] .        in the present work ,",
    "the fitting procedure of step [ fit ] of section [ remind ] is performed in the entire range of values of @xmath55 0,g^{*}\\right [ $ ] .",
    "consequently the entire classical - to - critical crossover specific to the field theoretical framework is completely accounted for by our final functions [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fdet],[eq : ddet ] ) and tables [ tabhom1][tabhom3 ] ] .",
    "this is illustrated , for the ising model ( @xmath1 ) , by fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) which displays the evolution of two effective exponents @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which are defined as for example [ see eqs .",

    "( [ fig1 ] ) shows the effective exponents ( calculated from the crossover functions of tables [ tabhom1 ] and [ tabinhom1 ] ) which interpolate between critical and classical ( mean field ) values following a form of crossover dictated by the framework of field theory .",
    "indeed the ( massless or critical , i.e. , for @xmath59 ) scalar field theory in three dimensions is defined on a special trajectory of the renormalization group ( a renormalized trajectory @xcite [ rt ] ) which takes its origin at the gaussian fixed point ( characterized by classical values of the `` critical '' exponents ) and joins the wilson - fisher fixed point ( where the critical exponents take on their critical values according to the universality class considered ) .",
    "of course , the crossover so induced is not universal , it is specific of the framework used . in fact",
    ", strictly speaking , only the extreme asymptotic moving away from the wilson - fisher fixed point induced by small non - zero values of @xmath3 is universal ( critical exponents and critical amplitude combinations ) , even the first - correction amplitude ( defined in the close vicinity of the fixed point when @xmath3 is not very small ) is not universal .",
    "for example , in the present work , a specific definite sign of the first correction amplitude is imposed due to the rt chosen , however in actual systems that kind of correction may well be of the opposite sign and even absent @xcite .",
    "fortunately , nonuniversal does not mean necessarily absent in actual critical behaviors .",
    "it may well occur that actual systems ( or models ) display , more or less partially , the kind of crossover calculated from field theory @xcite . see section [ useof ] for a practical use of the crossover functions .",
    "let us now give some technical informations on the fitting procedure of step [ fit ] of section [ remind ] that must be applied two times for each quantity considered because of the two error bounds `` @xmath60 '' and `` @xmath61 '' ( see sections [ remind ] and [ criteria ] for the meaning of these bounds ) .    in order to analytically reproduce the functions calculated point by point",
    ", we use the following general form @xcite : @xmath62 in which @xmath63 is the maximum number of factors ( in a preliminary work @xcite we had @xmath64 , in the present work @xmath63 can be as large as @xmath65 ) , and with : @xmath66 in which @xmath21 is the correction exponent .",
    "we have adjusted each of the parameters @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath21 so as to fit the discretized evolutions of the quantities considered ( @xmath74 , @xmath33 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) as continuous functions of the temperature - like variable @xmath3 in the range @xmath77 $ ] . of course , there are some external constraints on the values of these parameters which facilitate their adjustment :    1 .   the exponents @xmath68 and @xmath21 must take on values already known from the resummation of the corresponding elementary series .",
    "2 .   the amplitude @xmath67 is easily determined with few points corresponding to very small values of @xmath3 .",
    "3 .   to make it easy to get a close reproduction of the crossover towards the classical behavior when @xmath78 , there are constraints : * on @xmath79 , so that we have ( see , for example , eqs .",
    "( a9 , a10 ) of s. caracciolo et al .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath80 this leads to : @xmath81 * on one of the couple @xmath69 s by imposing that a known classical behavior is reached in the limit @xmath82 then it comes : @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 the classical values of the critical exponents and amplitude respectively .",
    "this leads to the constraints for one of the @xmath86 s : @xmath87 ^{1/y_{i_{0}}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the classical values @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath89 or @xmath90 and @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 or @xmath94 for respectively the susceptibility , the correlation length , the coexistence curve and the specific heat [ @xmath73 is the additive critical part of the specific heat and @xmath95 its classical value ; @xmath96 in the inhomogeneous phase ( @xmath97 ) , while @xmath98 in the homogeneous phase ( @xmath8 ) ] .    with the above prescriptions , we have been able to reproduce the original calculated points with a maximum ( local in @xmath3 ) of relative deviation less than @xmath99 ( in the worst case and for a limited number of functions especially in the inhomogeneous phase ) .",
    "however , globally ( mean value of the local deviations over the entire range of @xmath3 ) , the adjustment is much better for all the quantities .",
    "the results of those adjustments to the discrete calculated points are given in tables [ tabhom1][tabhom3 ] .",
    "we emphasize that the large number of digits displayed in the tables lays no claim to a better accuracy than in the work of gz , it is simply required to obtain a careful fit of the crossover functions to the discontinuous points primarily calculated from the available perturbative series .      in our preceding work @xcite , the resummation criteria of step [ leroy ] of section [ remind ] which gave the bounds `` @xmath60 '' and `` @xmath100 '' were not chosen so as to closely reproduce the uncertainty of the ( at that time up - to - date ) estimates of universal asymptotic critical quantities ( exponents and amplitude combinations ) .",
    "they simply proceeded from a primary analysis of the convergences of the elementary series [ i.e. , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , etc@xmath103 ] resulting from the ( unique ) resummation technique considered .",
    "this makes a notable difference because a given function brings several elements into play [ see , e.g. , eq .  ( [ eq : integrale ] ) ] introducing a possible frustration of the individual resummation criteria .",
    "moreover , when one determines the error bar for an individual quantity , one often rounds it up because several resummation methods may have been considered yielding answers slightly different from each other . since the various asymptotic critical behaviors of the functions of interest ( @xmath10 , etc@xmath103 ) result from the combination of a small number of elementary series @xcite ( namely : @xmath44 , @xmath102 , @xmath104 and a few amplitude functions ) , the individual criteria were combined in our preceding work @xcite so as to provide an envelope of the error accounting automatically for correlations ( frustrations ) between the error bounds",
    "this has induced some underestimation of the errors when the universal critical exponents or amplitude combinations were ( re)-considered from the final expressions of the functions compared to their independent estimates .",
    "the spirit of the present work is different .",
    "we have constrained the resummation criteria of the elementary series so as to get as closely as possible the gz estimates for the universal quantities despite the possible frustrations of the error bounds mentioned above .",
    "thus we have taken into account the extensions up to seven loops of the series for the critical exponents given by murray and nickel @xcite .",
    "for the reasons indicated just above , and also because the error estimates of the amplitude combinations of gz are deduced from the analysis of the parameter dependence in the equation of state @xcite ( they have not been obtained from the direct analysis of specific series for the quantities of interest ) , we have encountered some difficulties in fixing the resummation criteria for some amplitude series ( it is likely that gz have overestimated the error for some quantities ) . in addition , in doing so and concerning the amplitudes",
    "we have introduced an imbalance between the error estimates of the two phases .",
    "indeed our criteria are adjusted so as to get universal _ ratios _ ( or combinations ) of amplitudes which , structurally in the present work , express themselves as series strictly defined in the inhomogeneous phase . on the contrary ,",
    "the resummation criteria in the homogeneous phase ( for only one amplitude function ) have been fixed without constraint .",
    "consequently , the resulting error estimates of the correction amplitudes that we presently obtain are larger than in the previous work of refs . @xcite and notably in the inhomogeneous phase case ; they are presumably overestimated ( see below and part [ error ] ) .",
    "table [ tabcritexpo ] shows our estimates of the critical exponents ( resulting from our resummation criteria ) compared to the gz estimates .",
    "one may observe some very small differences due to the fact that , in the present work , the scaling relations are automatically satisfied for each bound `` @xmath105 '' or `` @xmath61 '' ( see step [ leroy ] of section [ remind ] ) while only the central values of the gz exponent estimates satisfy the scaling relations ( the apparent errors for @xmath106 have been determined independently @xcite ) .",
    "table [ tabcritexpo ] shows how much the respective estimates meet the scaling relations in both cases .",
    "tables [ tabunivampl ] and [ tabunivampl2 ] display the values of the universal combinations of leading critical amplitudes as they are accounted for by our crossover functions .",
    "the degree of agreement with gz is graphically illustrated by figs ( [ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] ) .    from tables",
    "[ tabhom1][tabhom3 ] one may observe that our bounds on the correction exponent @xmath21 differ from gz .",
    "this is due to the correlation of errors mentioned above .",
    "indeed , we have never considered @xmath107 as an independent constituent of the asymptotic critical behavior .",
    "instead it has been ( numerically ) deduced from the resummation criteria associated with the elementary series @xmath102 and @xmath104 because of the definition @xmath108 with : @xmath109    the resummation criteria for the elementary series @xmath49 have been chosen so as to yield estimates on the bounds on @xmath38 very close to those of gz ( see table [ tabptfix ] ) .",
    "similarly , the present determinations of ( and the uncertainties on ) the first correction - to - scaling terms displayed in tables [ tabunivcorrampl1 ] and [ tabunivcorrampl2 ] differ from our preceding work @xcite essentially because of our systematic account for the up - to - date estimates of the leading amplitude combinations ( see tables [ tabunivampl ] and [ tabunivampl2 ] ) .",
    "notice the likely unrealistic smallness of the correction amplitude @xmath110 in the case `` min '' .",
    "this confirms our probable overestimation of the error on the correction terms ( see part [ error ] ) .",
    "it is worth indicating that the values displayed in tables [ tabunivcorrampl1 ] and [ tabunivcorrampl2 ] are not obtained from the crossover functions of tables [ tabhom1][tabhom3 ] by simply using the expression [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : fdet ] ) ] :    @xmath111    which would be the right expression if the correction exponent in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fdet ] ) was the actual correction exponent @xmath21 instead of the effective exponent @xmath112 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ddet ] ) . to get the values displayed in tables [ tabunivcorrampl1 ] and [ tabunivcorrampl2 ] we have made specific fits of the functions @xmath113 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fdet ] ) to the theoretical points with @xmath114 in ranges of values of @xmath115 ( as in the preceding work @xcite ) .",
    "as already said above , the structural form of the classical - to - critical crossover that we produce here is not universal , it is peculiar to the field theoretical framework which corresponds to having performed a limit ( the continuum limit ) in the renormalization group ( rg ) theory @xcite .",
    "the approximation induces the idea that , strictly speaking , the `` nonasymptotic '' calculations would , in fact , be only valid in the close vicinity of @xmath116 . hence , _ we do not expect our functions to reproduce the experimental data in the entire range _",
    "@xmath117 0,+\\infty \\right [ $ ] .",
    "however , the width @xmath118 of the domain of agreement between experiments and field theory is not universal : it could actually be reduced ( purely and simply ) to the strict asymptotic critical region ( pure scaling laws ) or include exclusively the first correction to scaling , but , fortunately it may sometimes be much larger and could even cover the entire crossover region ! it is our aim to allow experimentalists to determine the width @xmath118 of the domain of agreement .",
    "notice that , we do not aim at determining ( or providing ) all the ingredients needed to describe the variety of classical - to - critical crossovers that may be produced by actual systems , this would be too difficult ( due to the infinite variety of nonuniversal contributions ) .",
    "simply , we think our calculation accurate enough to allow the determination of @xmath118 for any system allowing , in some sense , the determination of subclasses of universality .",
    "as already explained @xcite , the comparison of the theoretical functions with experimental data involves a very small number of adjustable parameters :    1 .",
    "non - universal global factors , 2 .",
    "the proportionality factor @xmath119 between the temperature like scaling field @xmath3 and @xmath120 ( neglecting higher analytical contributions in @xmath121 which may sometimes be non - negligible @xcite but are out of the scope of our present aim ) : @xmath122 3 .",
    "additive regular background terms for the specific heat , 4 .",
    "eventually @xmath116 .",
    "for example the comparison with experimental measurements of the susceptibility @xmath33 may be made as follows : @xmath123 in which @xmath124 represents the experimental data and @xmath125 our function for one @xcite of the two bounds `` @xmath60 '' and `` @xmath61 '' .",
    "one generally expects theoretically that @xmath126 and @xmath119 take on the same values @xcite for the two sets of measurements above and below @xmath116 provided that the range of values of @xmath127 is not too large .",
    "the fact that @xmath126 must be unchanged is the consequence of the universality of the ratio @xmath128 with as @xmath129 : @xmath130 in which @xmath131 and @xmath132 are related to our previous definition [ eq .  ( [ eq : notatb ] ) ] as follows : @xmath133    as for the stability of @xmath119 this is because the ratio @xmath134 is universal .",
    "the values of the universal amplitude combinations included in our calculated functions are given in tables [ tabunivampl ] , [ tabunivampl2 ] , [ tabunivcorrampl1 ] and [ tabunivcorrampl2 ] .      if one introduces @xmath119 literally as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : theta ] ) , then the fitted leading critical amplitude involves two adjustable parameters .",
    "this is not very suitable . for practical use",

    "so introduced , @xmath137 _ is a nonuniversal parameter which exclusively controls the magnitude of the corrections to scaling_. hence we can progressively adjust the theoretical functions to the data starting from the data close to the critical point with @xmath138 and then introducing more and more data with @xmath139 ( notice that @xmath140 ) up to the point where consistency is lost .",
    "the domain @xmath118 of @xmath121 where the experimental data and the field theory agree may involve correction - to - scaling terms higher than the first one and this is why it is interesting to have the theoretical expression under the form of a complete classical - to - critical crossover @xcite .",

    "for the specific heat , it comes : @xmath141 in which @xmath142 is an additive non critical ( i.e. , regular or analytic in @xmath121 ) background and @xmath143 a nonuniversal multiplicative factor which must be the same in the two phases .",
    "let us emphasize that the field theoretical form obtained for @xmath144 involves a specific critical additive background term which reproduces the famous `` classical jump '' of the specific heat [ see fig ( [ fig4 ] ) ] .",
    "of course , the magnitude of this jump is not universal but in the case where an actual system would reproduce the entire classical - to - critical crossover of field theory , then it should also exhibit this jump ( up to the global additive background @xmath142 analytic in @xmath121 ) .    if , in addition to @xmath75 and @xmath33 , we also possess coexistence curve data , we would have a stronger constraint since then no other adjustable parameter would be required to fit those new data . indeed in the relation : @xmath145 everything is fixed since @xmath146 is related to @xmath143 and @xmath126 due to the universal amplitude combination @xcite @xmath147 and @xmath119 must have the same value whatever the quantity considered .",
    "if we had simultaneously also access to experimental measurements of the correlation length @xmath74 , then the constraint would be even stronger since again the theory must agree with the data without new adjustable parameter .    in order to facilitate the use of the crossover functions displayed in table [ tabhom1][tabhom3 ] ,",
    "text - files of fortran code are provided @xcite .",
    "we have accounted for the error estimates by providing two sets ( `` max '' and `` min '' ) of functions .",
    "in general the accuracy of the experimental measurements are much smaller than in the present theoretical calculation so that it is not very important to make a difference between the two sets of functions . one or the other choice would provide essentially the same quality of the adjustment in the fitting procedure .    sometimes accounting for the difference between the bounds `` max '' and `` min '' may have some importance so that neither one or the other agrees with the measurements but a mixing of the two would . in such a case we propose to introduce the mixing via the introduction of a supplementary adjustable parameter @xmath148 .",

    "as said in part [ criteria ] it is likely that the close account of the gz estimates has led us to overestimate the uncertainty on the correction terms so that it seems to us useful to provide also the reader with functions reproducing the complete classical - to - critical crossover according to the resummation criteria of the previous ( but corrected , see @xcite ) work of refs @xcite although ( or rather because ) , this time , the error are underestimated .",
