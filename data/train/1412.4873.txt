    "the superconducting ( sc ) radio - frequency ( rf ) cavity is a key component of modern particle accelerators  @xcite .",
    "its performance is described by the peak surface magnetic - field , @xmath0 , and the quality factor , @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath0 is proportional to the accelerating gradient defined by the average electric field that the charged particles see during transit , which determines necessary accelerator length to achive a target particle energy .",
    "@xmath1 is defined by the ratio of stored energy to dissipation per rf cycle .",
    "a higher @xmath1 is necessary to maintain the cryogenic load manageable as @xmath0 increases .",
    "improvements of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are vital technological challenges for a future high - energy accelerator , such as the international linear collider @xmath2-upgrades  @xcite .",
    "the recently - developed surface processing recipe involving impurity - doping enabled to obtain higher @xmath1 than what had been achieved previously  @xcite .",
    "however , typical achievable @xmath0 of impurity - doped nb cavities remain rather small  @xcite .",
    "the record value of @xmath0 of nitrogen - doped nb cavities is @xmath3 , and that of titanium - alloyed nb cavities is @xmath4 .",
    "the multilayer coating  @xcite also attracts attention as an idea for realizing high - field and high-@xmath1 scrf cavity , but still is in a proof - of - concept stage  @xcite .",
    "how large @xmath0 can be achieved by cavities based on these new technologies is a topic of interest in the scrf community .",
    "the fundamental limit of @xmath0 is thought to be imposed by the superheating field , @xmath5 , at which the bean - livingston ( bl ) barrier for penetration of vortices disappears  @xcite . for a type ii sc with a large ginzburg - landau ( gl ) parameter , @xmath6 is computed in all temperature range below the critical temperature @xmath7  @xcite , which is applicable to materials like the dirty nb , @xmath8 , @xmath9 etc .",
    ", if the surface can be regarded as ideally flat . according to studies on surface topographies of scrf materials  @xcite , however , the surface is covered by multi - scale structures characterized by the fractal nature  @xcite .",
    "in particular , nano - scale defects distribute with much higher density than micrometer- or millimeter - scale defects and almost continuously exists on the surface .",
    "@xmath5 is reduced at each nano - defect .",
    "then the limit of @xmath0 of a real cavity would be imposed not by @xmath6 but by an effective superheating field @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a suppression factor that contains effects of nano - defects .    in this paper , the field limit of scrf cavity made of a type ii sc with a large gl parameter is studied with taking effects of nano - defects into account .",
    "we consider a simple model of nano - defect and derive a formula for suppression factor , @xmath11 , in the framework of the london theory . combining the formula with data of surface topographic studies , @xmath12 of materials with large gl parameters can be evaluated .",
    "there exist several types of defect models that treat the suppression of @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "in particular , buzdin and daumens  @xcite and aladyshkin et al .",
    "@xcite studied the groove with triangular section and derived simple formulae for locally suppressed @xmath6 , which can incorporate a geometry of defect via an angle parameter and are useful for modeling surface topographies  @xcite .",
    "their formulae are , however , derived under an assumption that the groove has an infinite depth , which can be applied to a defect with a depth much larger than penetration depth ( @xmath13 )  @xcite , but can not be applied to that smaller than penetration depth ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "we consider a model of a groove with triangular section as shown in fig .",
    "gray and white regions represent an sc and the vacuum , respectively .",
    "the surface of sc is parallel to the @xmath15 plane .",
    "the groove and the applied magnetic - field are parallel to the @xmath16-axis .",
    "a geometry of groove is specified by a depth , @xmath17 , and an angle , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) . a slope angle",
    "is then given by @xmath20 .",
    "the sc material is a type ii sc with a large gl parameter , and its coherence length and penetration depth are given by @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the assumption @xmath23 is necessary for treating the model in the framework of the london theory .",
    "the parameters of the model are summarized in table  [ table1 ] .",
    ".parameters of the model . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath12 of this model can be evaluated by calculating forces acting on a vortex in the framework of the london theory  @xcite .",
    "suppose there exist a single vortex next to the groove , as shown in fig .",
    "this vortex feels two distinct forces , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath24 is a force from an external magnetic - field , and @xmath25 is that from the surface .",
    "the former draws the vortex into the inside , and the latter pushes the vortex to the outside .",
    "when the total force @xmath26 vanishes , the derivative of free - energy with respect to vortex position vanishes , namely , the bl barrier disappears .",
    "thus @xmath12 is a field at which these two competing forces are balanced . in order to evaluate these forces , current densities at the vortex position",
    "are necessary , which can be calculated by using a powerful mathematical tool ; the method of conformal mapping .",
    "a lot of examples of the technique relevant to this work are summarized in a text book  @xcite or a previous study  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that calculations based on the london theory suffers divergences of current density at the vortex core and the sharp corner .",
    "these artifacts disappear if the suppression of superfluid density by current and the non - locality of current - field relation of the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory are taken into account .",
    "we choose instead to introduce a cutoff scale of the london theory , @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "this small - scale cutoff makes an effective minimum distance between the surface and an axis of vortex core , and @xmath25 becomes finite .",
    "the screening - current density at the sharp corner diverges , but that at a vortex next to the corner becomes finite due to an effective minimum distance between them , and @xmath24 also becomes finite .",
    "note that introducing a finite curvature - radius of the corner  @xcite makes the model more realistic , eliminates a divergence of screening - current density , and makes @xmath24 finite without cutting off , which might be a work to be addressed in a future , but @xmath25 diverges if a cutoff is not introduced .",
    "a cutoff is indispensable as long as @xmath12 is evaluated in the framework of the london theory .",
    "the model introduced above and following calculations based on the london theory only gives qualitative results , but may be a good starting point to evaluate local reduction of the surface barrier by small topographic defects and the maximum field at which this surface barrier vanishes .       and",

    "the calculation of @xmath32 is a two - dimensional problem that can be formulated on the complex plane of the complex variable @xmath35 , which can be easily solved by using the conformal mapping that maps the sc with flat surface on the complex @xmath36-plane into that with groove on the @xmath37-plane ( see appendix  [ appendix_jm ] ) .",
    "then the components of @xmath32 are given by  @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a screening current far from the groove , @xmath40 is the inverse of the map @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 $ ] , and @xmath44 ( see appendix  [ appendix_k1k2 ] ) . the screening current distribution calculated from eq .",

    "note here that @xmath86 is a good approximation at @xmath87 where it is close to @xmath88 of the gl or the quasi - classical ( qc ) theory  @xcite , but is not necessarily a good approximation at a low temperature , @xmath89 . to evaluate @xmath12 at @xmath89 accurately ,",
    "whole calculations should be carried out in the qc theory .",
    "we choose instead to improve the approximation by incorporating a correction based on the result of the qc theory : @xmath5 increases from @xmath90 at @xmath87 to @xmath91 at @xmath89  @xcite .",
    "then we can estimate @xmath92 at @xmath89 as @xmath93 substituting @xmath94 , we obtain @xmath95 . note that @xmath11 also depends on the temperature via @xmath21 and is proportional to @xmath96 , but is not sensitive to @xmath76 at a small slope angle as shown in fig .",
    "thus @xmath97 is thought to be valid at a broad temperature range .",
    "it is interesting to compare the above value with test results of nitrogen - doped nb cavities . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , @xmath98 is above the maximum field that has been achieved so far , and all other results are below it . in order to go beyond the limit of ep surface ( @xmath97 ) , a surface processing technology that can realize a further smooth surface with @xmath99 is necessary .",
    "mechanical polishing techniques that enable mirror - like finishes  @xcite might be effective . on the other hand , for the case that the buffered chemical polishing ( bcp ) is applied instead of ep , surfaces have broader distributions of slope angle ( @xmath100 ) as shown in the surface topographic study@xcite , and @xmath11 would be further suppressed . in much the same way as the above , @xmath11 of surface of other materials with large gl parameters including multilayer scs , and those after various surface processing technologies can also be evaluated by using eq .  ( [ eq : bs ] ) , if data of topographic studies are available .    it should be noted that a surface layer of nb cavity after the low - temperature baking ( ltb ) is an example of the dirty - limit nb , but the field limit of ltb - processed cavity can not be naively evaluated by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs ] ) , because this system is not a simple semi - infinite sc .",

    "in such a system , it is known that a vortex is pushed to a direction of sc with a larger penetration depth  @xcite ; a vortex is repelled from nb with a smaller penetration depth behind the dirty layer .",
    "thus , in a study of the field limit of ltb - processed nb cavity , this non - trivial effect on the vortex dynamics should be carefully taken into account .",
    "this topic should also be addressed in a future work .",
