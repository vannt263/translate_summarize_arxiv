    "at sufficiently high density a quark matter is expected to become a color superconductor , which has stirred a lot of interests @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of color superconductivity is essentially the quark analogue of bcs scenario@xcite , which implies that if there is an attractive interaction in a cold fermi sea , the system is unstable against the formation of a diquark(cooper pair ) condensate@xcite . in qcd case at asymptotically high density ,",
    "the dominant interaction between two quarks is due to the one - gluon exchange , which is attractive in the color antitriplet channel .",
    "a first principle calculation can be carried out perturbatively at this density and the asymptotic formula for the energy gap and the transition temperature have been derived @xcite . at moderately high density that is accessible in a compact star ,",
    "the instanton mediated interaction may dominate , which is again attrarctive in the color antisymmetric channel .",
    "because of its nonperturbative origin , one has to resort to various phenomenological models , such as njl model@xcite to explore the color superconductivity in this case .",
    "color superconductivity has a very rich phase structure because of its color and flavor as well as spin degrees of freedom@xcite .",
    "it is well - established that at extremely high density , where the chemical potential is much larger than the strange quark mass , the ground state is characterized by the so - called color - flavor locked(cfl)condensate@xcite .",
    "but actually the chemical potential is unlikely to be much larger than 500mev in the cores of a compact star .",
    "therefore , the heavier strange quark may not be able to participate the pairing with up and down quarks .",
    "the color superconducting phase with only two light quarks is normally called the 2sc phase . however , because of the @xmath1-equilibrium and the charge neutrality conditions of the quark system , nontrivial relations will be imposed between the chemical potentials of different quark flavors@xcite . in turn , such relations could substantially influence the pairing dynamics .",
    "it was shown that gapless 2sc@xciteand gapless cfl@xciteas well as gapless loff@xcitecould appear in quark matter regarding the influence of @xmath1-equilibrium and the charge neutrality .",
    "one of the main consequences of color superconductivity in dense quark matter is the opening of an energy gap , which impacts on the transport and thermodynamic properties of quark matter .",
    "the general pairing potential is retarded and contains damping terms ( landau damping in case of one - gluon exchange of qcd ) , which corresponds to branch cuts along the real axis of the complex energy plane .",
    "consequently , the gap function depends on the energy- momentum and acquires a nontrivial imaginary part along the axis of real energy .",
    "a gap function with a nonzero imaginary part is actually well known from strongly coupled electronic superconductors , as studied in eliashberg theory@xcite .",
    "but the parallel case has not been analyzed in detail until recently by rueter @xcite .",
    "our main work in this paper is to derive the equation of the imaginary part of the gap function in weak coupling .",

    "the current work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we shall demonstrate some general properties of the energy gap as a function of the energy and momentum .",
    "then we review the eliashberg equations for the energy gap at real energy in section 3 .",
    "its solution will be presented in section 4 and the concluding remarks will then be given in section 5 . moreover",
    ", technical details on the derivation of the real part of the gap will be sketched in appendix a. our units are @xmath3 and 4-vectors are denoted by capital letters , @xmath4 in our formulas .",
    "before embarking on the calculation of the imaginary part of the energy gap , we shall clarify some general properties of the energy gap regarding its functional dependence on the energy and momentum dictated by the invariance under a space inversion , @xmath5 , or a time reversal , @xmath6 .",
    "these properties are model independent and exact to all orders of the coupling strength .",
    "while , some of them may be known in the case of electronic superconductivity , they remain murky for color superconductivity .",
