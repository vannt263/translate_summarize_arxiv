    "since their discovery by scharmer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , dark - cored penumbral filaments have attracted much interest because they could reveal the primary mode of magnetoconvection taking place in sunspot penumbrae .",
    "the dark cores of penumbral filaments are narrow ( @xmath1  km ) lanes running along the filament axes , surrounded by two lateral brightenings .",
    "it has been proposed that dark - cored penumbral filaments are the manifestation of magnetic flux tubes ( stterlin et al .",
    "2004 ; bellot rubio et al .  2005 ; borrero 2007 ) or field - free gaps in the penumbra ( spruit & scharmer 2006 ; scharmer & spruit 2006 ) , but no consensus has been reached yet .",
    "the morphology and temporal evolution of these structures are well known from high - resolution ( 0102 ) filtergrams .",
    "imaging observations show the two lateral brightenings to move with the same speed and direction as a single entity .",
    "spectroscopic measurements at 02 resolution ( bellot rubio et al .  2005",
    "; rimmele & marino 2006 ) have revealed that the evershed flow is concentrated preferentially in the dark cores , where it seems to be an upflow near the umbra / penumbra boundary .",
    "they also provide some evidence that the dark cores possess weaker magnetic fields than their lateral brightenings .",
    "one - wavelength longitudinal magnetograms at 02 resolution ( langhans et al .",
    "2005 ; langhans et al .",
    "2007 ) show lower circular polarization signals in the dark cores as compared with the bright edges , supporting the conclusions derived from spectroscopy .",
    "however , high - precision vector magnetic field measurements of these structures have never been made because of the relatively modest angular resolution attained by ground - based spectropolarimeters .    in this letter",
    ", we report on the first spectropolarimetric measurements of dark - cored penumbral filaments .",
    "the observations were taken with hinode s solar optical telescope at a resolution of 03 .",
    "dark - cored filaments turn out to be prominent structures in polarized light , showing anomalous , very asymmetric stokes @xmath2 profiles in sunspots outside the disk center .",
    "in addition , we find that the dark cores possess weaker and more horizontal fields than their surroundings .",
    "we used the spectropolarimeter ( sp ; lites et al .",
    "2001 ) of the solar optical telescope ( sot ) aboard hinode ( kosugi et al .  2007 ) to observe the 630.2  nm lines emerging from ar 10923 on november 10 and 14 , 2006 . on those days",
    "the spot was located at heliocentric angles of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the four stokes profiles of the two lines were measured by scanning the spectrograph slit across the spot in steps of 0148 , with a wavelength sampling of 2.153  pm  pixel@xmath0 .",
    "the sp slit width and the ccd pixel size are 016 .",
    "the integration time per slit position was 4.8  s , resulting in a noise level of @xmath5 as measured in the continuum of stokes @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath2 .",
    "image stabilization down to 001 rms was provided by the sot tip - tilt system ( shimizu et al.2007 ) .",
    "these measurements reach a spatial resolution of about 032 , while the diffraction limit of the sot is @xmath8 at 630.2  nm .",
    "the data have been corrected for dark current , flat field , and instrumental polarization .",
    "we estimate that residual instrumental crosstalk is not larger than a few @xmath9 .",
    "the calibrated stokes profiles have been used to create maps of continuum intensity , @xmath10 , total circular polarization , @xmath11 , total linear polarization , @xmath12 , total polarization , @xmath13 , and area asymmetry , @xmath14 , where the integrals extend over a wavelength range of 0.1098  nm to encompass the 630.25  nm line .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows two @xmath15 regions in the limb - side and center - side penumbra of ar 10923 at a heliocentric angle of 50@xmath16 .",
    "the small white arrows mark the positions of six dark - cored penumbral filaments . as noticed by stterlin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the dark cores show higher continuum intensity contrasts in the center - side penumbra ( right panels ) .",
    "we find the dark - cored filaments to be much more prominent in polarized light than in continuum intensity ( compare , e.g. , the first and fourth panels of figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this is also the case for the november 14 observations , when the spot was at only @xmath4 from disk center .",
    "the fact that dark - cored filaments show up more prominently in polarized light implies that there is no one - to - one correspondence between the underlying magnetic fields and their continuum intensity signatures .",
    "thus , a complete characterization of the penumbra can not be based solely on intensity measurements .",
    "the dark cores exhibit smaller circular and linear polarization signals than the bright structures surrounding them , which is highly suggestive of weaker fields .",
    "contrary to one - wavelength magnetograms , the tcp , tlp and tp signals are not affected by velocities , but no unambiguous conclusion on field strengths can be drawn from simple inspections of these parameters because they still depend on temperature .",
    "an interesting fact is that the dark - cored filaments are detected as structures of enhanced stokes @xmath2 area asymmetries in the limb - side penumbra of spots away from disk center ( bottom left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . on the center side",
    "they are not distinct features in area asymmetry .",
    "very likely , this is the result of projection effects that shift the optical depth scale toward higher geometrical heights and thus place the evershed flow deeper in the line forming region or even outside of it .",
    "the enhanced area asymmetries imply the existence of gradients / discontinuities of velocity ( and possibly other atmospheric parameters ) along the line of sight ( los ) which are stronger in the filaments than in the surroundings .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the anomalous stokes @xmath2 spectra emerging from dark - cored filaments .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] displays the circular polarization profiles observed along the dark core of a limb - side filament near the inner penumbral boundary . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the spectra from the surrounding umbra at the same radial distances ( cf .  the dots in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the bright penumbral grain that forms the head of the filament exhibits regular stokes @xmath2 profiles with the polarity of the spot .",
    "further outward along the dark core , the circular polarization profiles show three lobes indicating the existence of opposite polarity fields along the los , _ one of which is strongly doppler - shifted to the red_. its los velocity can roughly be estimated as @xmath17 km  s@xmath0 from the wavelength separation between the redmost stokes @xmath2 peaks .",
    "this magnetic field component gradually takes over , giving rise to one - lobed stokes @xmath2 spectra at a distance of @xmath18 and two - lobed profiles of opposite polarity farther than @xmath19 .",
    "in contrast , the circular polarization profiles emerging from the adjacent background umbra keep the polarity of the spot at all radial distances , and do not exhibit anomalous shapes .    the multi - lobed stokes @xmath2 spectra observed in limb - side filaments at 03 resemble those measured from the ground at much lower angular resolution . in our data , we can for the first time distinguish between the dark cores and the lateral brightenings , each of which may differ in their magnetic properties .",
    "thus , these measurements constrain horizontal variations of the physical parameters relative to those along the los much more tightly than earlier observations . both fig .  2 and",
    "the observed stokes @xmath2 asymmetries indicate a complex magnetic topology in the dark - cored filaments , with discontinuities or gradients along the los , and possibly also lateral gradients .",
    "to explain the observations , the height variations / discontinuities of atmospheric parameters must be present well within the stokes @xmath2 formation region ( i.e. , significantly above the @xmath20 level ; cabrera solana et al .",
    "2005 ) , as otherwise they would be unable to produce the multi - lobed profiles depicted in fig .",
    "finally , we note that one - wavelength longitudinal magnetograms of complex spectra such as the ones discussed here may even fail in retrieving the correct polarity of the field , depending on the exact wavelength of the observations .",
    "we estimate the vector magnetic field of dark - cored penumbral filaments and their surroundings by inverting the observed spectra with the sir code ( ruiz cobo & del toro iniesta 1992 ) .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the november 14 data set , since on that day the stokes profiles show negligible asymmetries in the absence of strong los velocities ( due to the proximity of the spot to disk center ) .",
    "the spectra can be fitted remarkably well in terms of one - component model atmospheres featuring constant ( height - independent ) vector magnetic fields , los velocities , and microturbulent velocities ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the temperature stratification is determined by changing the slope and @xmath21 value of the penumbral model of bellot rubio et al .",
    "in total , the inversion returns the values of 8 free parameters .",
    "we assume zero stray light contamination and unity magnetic filling factors .",
    "[ fig4 ]    figure  [ fig4 ] displays continuum intensity and total polarization maps of a small region in the limb - side penumbra of ar 10923 on november 14 .",
    "at least four dark - cored filaments can easily be recognized , especially in the polarization map .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] are the field strengths and inclinations resulting from the inversion , expressed in the local reference frame ( lrf ) .",
    "the dark cores stand out clearly as long , narrow streaks of weaker ( @xmath22 g ) and more inclined ( @xmath23 ) fields than the lateral brightenings or surrounding structures .",
    "in general , we find a very smooth magnetic topology in this part of the penumbra , which is only altered by the presence of the dark cores .",
    "note that the inclination map shows extended patches in the penumbra where the polarity of the magnetic field is opposite to that of the spot , i.e. , field lines returning back to the solar surface ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the existence of such field lines has been inferred from inversions of stokes profiles at lower resolution , but this is the first time they are detected so close to the umbra ( see also ichimoto et al .",
    "2007 ) . as pointed out by bellot rubio ( 2007 )",
    ", the existence of field lines returning to the solar surface well within the penumbra may pose a serious problem for the gappy model of spruit & scharmer ( 2006 ) .",
    "the nearly diffraction - limited ( 03 ) spectropolarimetric measurements performed by hinode reveal that dark - cored penumbral filaments are conspicuous structures in polarized light , showing higher contrasts than in continuum intensity .",
    "the total polarization signal emerging from the dark cores is smaller than that observed in the lateral brightenings , which is highly suggestive of lower field strengths .",
    "we have confirmed this hyphotesis by carrying out an inversion of the spectra observed in a sunspot very close to disk center .",
    "the dark cores possess @xmath25  g weaker fields than the lateral brightenings and surrounding structures , i.e. , they are not field - free . in addition , the field is deduced to be more horizontal in the dark cores than in the lateral brightenings , by some @xmath26 .",
    "the field strength and inclination differences are surprisingly small , which might indicate still insufficient angular resolution and/or simplistic modeling ( the inversions performed here just provide _ average _ values of the atmospheric parameters along the los ) .",
    "high - resolution magnetograph observations ( langhans et al",
    ".  2007 ) suggest that the actual differences could be larger .",
    "our results are consistent with the idea that dark - cored filaments represent magnetic flux tubes embedded in an ambient field .",
    "their properties coincide with those inferred from uncombed inversions of visible and infrared lines ( weaker and more inclined fields in the tubes as compared with the background atmosphere ; large area asymmetries and multi - lobed stokes @xmath2 profiles caused by strong evershed flows along the tubes ; see , e.g. , beck 2006 and borrero et al .",
    ". they also agree with the properties of moving penumbral tubes as deduced from numerical simulations ( schlichenmaier et al .",
    "1998 ; schlichenmaier 2002 ) .",
    "according to the simulations , the field is weaker in the tubes to maintain horizontal mechanical equilibrium .",
    "it is also more inclined because the tubes rapidly bend when they reach the subadiabatic layers of the photosphere during their ascent . in the moving tube simulations ,",
    "evershed flows exceding 10 km  s@xmath0 are driven by gas pressure gradients that build up as a consequence of the radiative cooling of the plasma . by contrast , no mechanism capable of explaining evershed flows of several km  s@xmath0 has been identified in the gappy penumbral model as yet .",
    "the eveshed flow is an ingredient without which the observed stokes @xmath2 shapes and area asymmetries can not be understood .",
    "hopefully , further analyses of hinode spectropolarimetric observations will help distinguish between competing models of the penumbra ( bellot rubio 2007 ) .",
    "initial efforts in this direction are presented by jurak et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and ichimoto et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "hinode is a japanese mission developed and launched by isas / jaxa , with naoj as domestic partner and nasa and stfc ( uk ) as international partners .",
    "it is operated by these agencies in co - operation with esa and nsc ( norway ) .",
    "this work has been partially funded by the spanish mec through project esp2006 - 13030-c06 - 02 ."
