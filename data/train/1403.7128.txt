    "near - earth objects ( neos ) play an important role in shaping the geological histories of terrestrial planets .",
    "recent studies have shown neo impacts are common in inner solar system ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for other terrestrial planets",
    ", it has been suggested that the impact flux is comparable to the near - earth environment @xcite .",
    "although over 99% of the impactors are asteroids @xcite , comets are generally of special interests , as they carry significant amount of volatile and organic material , which is life - essential . on earth ,",
    "kilometer - sized cometary impacts occur every @xmath1  yr @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "close comet - planet approach is also significant in terms of the accretion of water and organic materials on the planet : comets eject a large amount of material into the vicinity of their nuclei , and they may still influence the planet without a direct impact .",
    "although approaches are more common than impacts , it is still too rare for us to observe and study a real case : the closest cometary approach to the earth since the establishment of modern science was d/1770 l1 ( lexell ) , which missed the earth by @xmath2 earth radius . from the impact rates",
    ", we estimate that close approach within 25 earth radius with kilometer - sized comets occurs once every @xmath3  yr .",
    "this is equivalent to the frequency of cometary approach within 50 martian radius to mars assuming that the cometary impact flux ( like the total impact flux ) is comparable between earth and mars .    yet",
    "this is what would happen later this year : a dynamically new comet , c/2013 a1 ( siding spring ) , is to miss mars by @xmath4 martian radius at 2014 oct .",
    "19.8 ( ut ) ( figure  [ fig - a1orb ] and [ fig - dist ] ) .",
    "c / siding spring was discovered on 2013 jan . 3 at a heliocentric distance of 7.2  au ; subsequent follow - up observations revealed a 10  coma which indicated distinct cometary activity at such a large heliocentric distance @xcite .",
    "as of 2014 feb .",
    "1 , the comet is determined to be in a hyperbolic orbit , with @xmath5 ; the current estimated miss distance between c / siding spring and mars is about @xmath0 martian radii or @xmath6  km . ] .",
    "dynamically new comets are constrained on loosely bounded or unbounded orbits , and are thought to originate from the outer region of solar system , namely the oort cloud . due to the fact that they have had nil access to the inner solar system , they preserve valuable and unique information about the pre - solar nebula . however , comparing to the periodical comets , which usually return to the inner solar system on a frequent and predictable basis , the dynamically new comets are difficult to investigate due to their small number and limited opportunity to study individual objects ( generally only once ) . the most productive method to study comets  in - situ exploration  is currently very difficult to be used on dynamically new comets , due to very short lead - time available for preparing and operating such missions .    as such",
    ", the close approach offers an unprecedented and extremely rare opportunity to directly study how material may be transferred from comets to terrestrial planets as well as the dynamically new comet itself .",
    "currently there are three operational orbiters ( mars reconnaissance orbiter , mars odyssey and mars express ) and two operational rovers ( opportunity and curiosity ) on mars ; in addition , two orbiters ( mars atmosphere and volatile evolution or maven , and mars orbiter mission or mom ) will arrive @xmath7 month before c / siding spring s closest approach .",
    "the fleet will have front seats for this event ; however , the small miss distance of the encounter also means that they may pass inside the dust coma / tail of c / siding spring .",
    "while the martian atmosphere will shield incoming dust particles ( meteoroids ) for the two rovers , the five orbiters will be at risk of bombardment of dust particles originated from the comet .",
    "cometary dusts pose a significant threat of causing physical damage to the spacecrafts ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , meteoroids originated from c / siding spring have higher kinetic energy than nominal sporadic ( background ) meteoroids , as the relative speed between the comet and mars is twice as high as the latter .",
    "early studies of c / siding spring before its close visit to mars will be essential in the sense of monitoring the evolution of the comet and helping assess the risk posed to the spacecrafts .    here",
    "we present our observations and modeling effort of c / siding spring in the hope to characterize the physical properties of the comet .",
    "we will first discuss our observations and their significance for constraining the particle size distribution ( psd ) of the comet , then we will present the semi - analytic model that will be used to match the observation and parameterize the cometary dust activity . eventually , we will use the best - matched parameters to investigate the fluency of cometary dust particles experienced by mars ( and anything in the proximity ) during the close encounter .",
    "after being released by the parent body , different sizes of dust particles follow different keplerian trajectories as they feel different radiation pressure and gravity from the sun .",
    "the ratio of later two quantities is defined as @xmath8 , of which @xmath9 where @xmath10 is particle density and @xmath11 is size .",
    "if we ignore the initial velocity of the particles with respect to the nucleus and compute a large number of particles with different @xmath8 released at different times , we can produce the so - called syndyne - synchrone diagram as defined by @xcite .",
    "occasionally , the earth - comet geometry is favorable to so that different syndyne curves ( i.e. equal-@xmath8 curves ) are well separated from each other as seen by the observer , which allows us to qualitatively constrain the psd of the comet .",
    "the occurrence of such geometry depends on the orientation of the orbital plane of the comet .",
    "we find out that for c / siding spring , such geometry would occur in september to november 2013 , while the solar elongation of the comet is adequate for optical observations ( figure  [ fig - obs - geom ] and [ fig - synpanel ] ) .",
    "the next `` slots '' will occur in june 2014 and september 2014 , but they are either suffered from small solar elongation or being too close to the encounter event .",
    "we conduct broad - band observations with a 0.18-m f/7 refraction telescope and 4k@xmath123k ccd camera ( pixel size 1.5  ) at jade scope observatory near siding spring , australia ( @xmath13  e , @xmath14  s ) , on november 12 , 20 and 23 , 2013 ( details summarized in table  [ tbl - obs ] ) .",
    "observations are unfiltered and the ccd sensor is most sensitive at @xmath15  nm .",
    "the raw frames are then subtracted by dark and bias fields and divided by flat fields .",
    "after initial reduction , the frames are registered with the nomad catalog @xcite so that they can be combined and stacked following the motion of c / siding spring .",
    "eventually , we end up with three `` master '' images from each night(figure  [ fig - img ] ) .",
    "we compute the syndyne - synchrone curves for the three master frames ( figure  [ fig - syn ] ) and immediately notice that c / siding spring s tail is skewed to smaller @xmath8 values ( i.e. larger particles ) , dominantly at the order of 0.01 .",
    "if we use @xmath16 @xcite and assume @xmath17 , @xmath18 is equivalent to @xmath19 or @xmath20 for a spherical particle .",
    "this number is significant because @xmath20 is considered to be the lower end of threat regime by spacecraft designers @xcite .",
    "since optical observation strongly favors micron - sized particles due to their higher scattering efficiency , the absence of tail structure at larger @xmath8 suggests that the cometary tail is dominated by larger , spacecraft - threatening particles .",
    "we develop a semi - analytic dust tail model ( dtm ) to parameterize the cometary dust tail .",
    "the key of parameterization involves the initial velocity , i.e. the velocity vector of the particles at the time it is ejected from the cometary nucleus .",
    "we start from the revised @xcite s model by @xcite which was used to study the perseid meteor stream formed by 109p / swift - tuttle :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the ejection velocity relative to the nucleus in @xmath23 , @xmath24 is heliocentric distance of the comet , @xmath10 is the bulk density of the meteoroids , @xmath25 is the radius of the cometary nucleus , and @xmath26 is the mass of the meteoroid .",
    "brown & jones reported a satisfactory agreement between the model and the observation for the case of perseid meteor stream , however they noted that the agreement might be due to the nature of high ejection velocity of p / swift - tuttle and may not be applicable to other comets . to accommodate this issue",
    ", we introduce a `` reference '' ejection velocity that had been used in other studies ( such as * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and rearrange the terms :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 ( in @xmath23 ) is a reference ejection velocity of particles with _ size _ @xmath29 and bulk density @xmath30 ejected by a cometary body of _ diameter _ of 1  km at a heliocentric distance of @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the dependence on heliocentric distance ; the introduction of @xmath32 will be elaborated in the next section .",
    "the @xmath28 corresponding to the constant of 10.2 in brown & jones model would be @xmath33 .",
    "we assume the particles are symmetrically released at the comet s sub - solar point at a direction @xmath34 from the sunward direction .",
    "this @xmath35 limit is chosen following the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the initial velocity model is fed by a monto - carlo subroutine that generates random particle with sizes following a power law : @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the accumulative particle number , and @xmath38 is the size distribution index .",
    "we then solve kepler s equation rigorously from the start time to the time of observation to determine the position of the particle .",
    "these steps are repeated until we have a sufficient number of particles to simulate the morphology of the cometary tail .    at the end",
    ", we compute the spatial intensity on a sky plane coordinate ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) .",
    "we consider a simple model without secondary effects such as the response efficiency of ccd sensor to different wavelength and the scattering efficiency due to particle shape .",
    "we consider the light contribution from each particle :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the modified geometric albedo .",
    "the intensity at ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) will just be the sum of intensities from all particles within the region ( @xmath43 ) :    @xmath44    finally , a 2-dimensional intensity map is created by looping around all possible ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) and computing the value of @xmath45 at each position .",
    "the treatment of @xmath32 is somewhat tricky , as a number of @xmath32 have been suggested by previous workers . for example , some studies from both cometary and meteor communities suggested @xmath46 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite s original model suggested @xmath47 , while @xmath48 @xcite and @xmath49 @xcite were also used .",
    "we notice that most studies adopted @xmath46 do not have data that cover a broad range of @xmath24 ; our initial test with @xmath46 also shows noticeable mismatch at large @xmath24 ( e.g. @xmath50  au ) .",
    "this may be due to the fact that the range of @xmath24 is not broad enough to constrain @xmath32 more effectively , but could also due to , for example , the onset of water - ice sublimation at @xmath51  au that dramatically enhances the ejection regime and hence no unique @xmath32 can be defined .    to investigate this matter",
    ", we use the observations of c/2012 s1 ( ison ) which are available in a broad range of @xmath24 .",
    "the unfiltered observations were taken at xingming observatory , china , from a few days after the discovery ( @xmath52  au ) to a few weeks before the perihelion ( @xmath53  au , see table  [ tbl - obs - ison ] ) .",
    "the dtm model is run at grids with @xmath54 $ ] and @xmath55~\\mathrm{m \\cdot s^{-1}}$ ] , with orbital elements from jpl  54 ( table  [ tbl - orb ] ) .",
    "a few parameters at the far ends are not tested as initial trials indicate that they are unlikely to contain the best fits .    except the nucleus size of c / ison , which has been reported to be at the order of 1  km @xcite",
    ", we have to make some assumptions , such as the albedo and particle density .",
    "although the nucleus size will not effectively affect our final result ( since its contribution is modest in most cases and can be balanced by a slightly larger or smaller @xmath28 term ) , we still keep it in the simulation as we hope that @xmath28 can be comparable to c / siding spring and other comets .",
    "the set of parameters are summarized in table  [ tbl - dtm - ison ] .",
    "the simulation results and the observations are then compared and graded separately by both authors on a boolean basis ( i.e. as `` possible fit '' or `` definitely not a possible fit '' ) .",
    "finally , the grades are summed and is scale to a score from 0 to 100 .",
    "the final score chart ( figure  [ fig - ison - score ] ) indicates that @xmath56  ( m / s ) , @xmath57 is the best fit .",
    "it is encouraging that no dramatic morphological change is presented near the water - ice sublimation line ( @xmath51  au ) , which means that the @xmath32 we found is an unique approximation to the entire @xmath24 range .",
    "the change at @xmath58  au case is most likely due to the contamination from cometary gas emission , as no filters were used to block the primary emission lines ( e.g. c@xmath59 and c@xmath60 that falls in the @xmath61  nm range where the imaging ccd is sensitive at ) ; we may remove the @xmath58  au case and it does not alter our result .",
    "after pinned down the @xmath32 constant , we run the dtm model for the case of c / siding spring with @xmath28 ranging from 1.0 to 4.2  m / s to determine @xmath28 . the input parameters and orbital elements summarized in table  [ tbl - orb ] and [ tbl - dtm - para ] .",
    "since the epochs of our observations are fairy close , we only simulate the nov .",
    "23 case , as the master frames were stacked from more frames and had a slightly better airmass .",
    "we estimate @xmath62  km considering two comparable comets which the nucleus diameters are constrained at a higher level of confidence : 19p / borrelly ( m1=8.9 , m2=13.8 , @xmath63  km ) and c/1996 b2 ( hyakutake ) ( m1=7.3 , m2=11.1 , @xmath64  km ) , in contrast c / siding spring has m1=8.6 , m2=10.4 .",
    "the simulation result is shown in figure  [ fig - a1dtm ] . comparing the simulation to the observation ( figure  [ fig - img ] ) , we see @xmath65  m / s as the optimal match .",
    "we note that the strong size gradient indicated in the syndyne diagram ( figure  [ fig - syn ] ) actually forged the result : since optical observation strongly favors smaller particles that dominates the west - end sector of the tail ( i.e. toward the clockwise direction ) , the west - end boundary ( about p.a .",
    "@xmath66 ) marks the true boundary of the tail .",
    "as we only simulate particles with @xmath67 , the simulated particles should mostly distribute within the anticlockwise direction of p.a .",
    "@xmath66 , which only the @xmath65  m / s case satisfies .",
    "such converge allows us to make a stronger conclusion on the optimal @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath65  m / s value is comparable to some comets that were previously studied , including 4p / faye , 22p / kopff and the rosetta mission target , 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko ( c.f .",
    "* note that the @xmath28 here needs to be @xmath68 to make the numbers comparable ) , although the dynamical origins of these comets seems to be different .",
    "it is interesting to note that this similarity comes with the fact that comets with similar dynamical origins can have a much deviated @xmath28 : for example , @xmath28 for 2p / encke is about a magnitude larger",
    ". this may be purely by coincidence , but further studies with larger sample size may determine if there is anything physical .",
    "eventually , we run the simulation for the encounter with best - fit parameters found in the previous iterations ( summarized in table  [ tbl - dtm - para ] ) , to study the influence of cometary dust at mars and its vicinity . unlike other meteor stream models ,",
    "our model does not include planetary perturbation ; but we think this is acceptable for the case of c / siding spring since the comet is far from the ecliptic plane ( @xmath69 ) until the encounter .    the synchronic feature on figure  [ fig - syn ] suggests that c / siding spring was active at least a year before our observations , therefore we choose @xmath70  d ( corresponding to 2012 jan .",
    "23 ) to be the start date of the simulated cometary activity to catch any early activities .",
    "state vectors of simulated particles are recorded within @xmath71  d of the closest encounter ( 2014 oct .",
    "18 , 18:30 ut to 2014 oct .",
    "20 , 18:30 ut ) in a step of 1  min . since simulating the entire set of cometary particles",
    "will take @xmath72 a bit of time ( comets typically release particles at a rate of @xmath73 ) , we only simulate a representative number of particles and scale them up afterwards .",
    "we first need to examine the dust production rate of c / siding spring ; this can be tied to the so - called @xmath74 quantity @xcite .",
    "the number of ejected particles in the particle size range ( @xmath75,@xmath76 ) can be related to @xmath74 by @xcite :    @xmath77}\\ ] ]    where @xmath78 for @xmath79 and @xmath80 for @xmath81 , with @xmath82 is the size population index , @xmath83 is the bond albedo and @xmath84 is the normalized phase function .",
    "we obtain the @xmath74 measurements conducted by a group of observers and collected by the `` cometas obs '' .",
    "the measurements show a steady @xmath74 near 1500  cm from @xmath85  au to @xmath86  au .",
    "by assuming @xmath87 when the comet gets into the water - ice sublimation line ( to include possible early onsets , we use a loose constraint , @xmath88  au ) , we estimate the @xmath74 of c / siding spring at 1  au to be 3700  cm , which corresponds to @xmath89 .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig - plot2r ] : mars will miss the dust cone by some 20 martian radius or 67,800  km .",
    "what about the extreme cases in the uncertainty ranges ? to investigate this , we run further simulations with some educative guesses about the uncertainty ranges : a factor of 10 for the minimum particle size , a factor of 2 for the diameter of the cometary nucleus , and 50% for the reference velocity .",
    "four combinations are tested with other parameters remain the same as table  [ tbl - dtm - para ] .",
    "the combinations and results are shown in table  [ tbl - flux ] and figure  [ fig - flux ] .    for scenario 4 , which the minimum particle size / mass remains unchanged ( i.e. particles",
    "are confined within the spacecraft - threatening category ) , we still find no direct encounter between mars and the dust cone . for the other three scenarios , the dust cone does reach mars .",
    "the peak times are about 3060  min . behind the closest approach .",
    "we see some `` peak - lets '' in the time series plots which should be artifacts due to low statistics rather than anything physical",
    ". the low statistics also make it difficult to determine the duration of the event , but we can crudely estimate the full - wide - half - maximum to be @xmath90  hr or less .",
    "the peak fluxes are at the order of @xmath91 while the accumulative fluxes are at the order of @xmath92 , appropriate to the meteoroids larger than @xmath93  kg .",
    "the absence of encounter in scenario 4 suggests that the particles that arrive mars in scenarios 13 are at the range of @xmath93 to @xmath94  kg , which are below the spacecraft- threatening regime .",
    "@xcite also studied the meteoroid influence at mars during the encounter of c / siding spring but with a different approach : they construct a symmetric analytic model of the coma that relates the dust production rate to the total magnitude ( m1 ) of the comet .",
    "as a separate check , the meteoroid flux experienced by giotto and stardust spacecrafts during their encounter with 1p / halley and 81p / wild were reproduced by this model and compared with the actual data , which order - of - magnitude agreement were found . since more parameters were on loose at the time of their study , they parameterized their result and reported an accumulative flux of @xmath95 for particles over @xmath96  kg under nominal conditions",
    ". they also conducted simulation with a dynamical meteor stream model that uses @xcite s ejection model ( wiegert , private comm . ) and found the numbers from the two models agreed within an order of magnitude , although the number from the dynamic model is in fact lower by a factor of 2 , of which they attributed to the difference in modeling assumptions .    since their study",
    ", the m1 of c / siding spring has been revised from 5.2 to 8.6 ; using eq .  18 in their study and @xmath17",
    ", we find a new value of @xmath97 .",
    "this is still more than three order of magnitude higher than our result . to investigate this difference , we test our model with @xmath28 set to the value equivalent to the @xcite s model and find a much closer value ( @xmath98 ) , which would allow an order - of - magnitude agreement to moorhead et al s result from the dynamical model . from here",
    "we suggest that the difference between the two results is primary contributed by different input parameters .",
    "the sporadic meteoroid influx on mars is about half of the influx on earth @xcite or @xmath99 for meteoroid",
    "larger than @xmath94  kg . for comparison ,",
    "the peak flux of the 2012 draconid meteor storm is @xmath100 for meteoroid larger than @xmath94  kg assuming a general power law distribution @xcite between the cumulative number of meteoroids larger than @xmath101 and @xmath94  kg respectively . ] .",
    "from here , our simulation seems to indicate that the meteoric influx at mars due to c / siding spring is comparable to the sporadic background . for the case of smaller - sized meteoroids ,",
    "the sporadic influx is about 3 magnitudes higher from @xmath94  kg to @xmath93  kg , which would still put the influx due to c / siding spring no higher than the sporadic background . the simulation also suggested that the bulk of the outburst ( if any ) would not be longer than the orbital period of the orbiters around mars . for the opportunity and curiosity rovers , the potential meteor outburst takes place at martian morning and afternoon respectively , which prevent any meteor observations from the rover .",
    "the impact on martian moons is another interesting topic . at the time of the encounter",
    ", deimos will be about 2 martian radius closer to the cometary nucleus than mars itself .",
    "depending on its physical property and impact angle , a @xmath102 meteoroid may produce a sub - meter crater on phobos and deimos .",
    "unfortunately , such crater is below the resolution of our current best images ( about 5  m per pixel ) , but it is worth pointing out that the high speed nature of meteoroids originated from c / siding spring should create larger craters more efficiently than nominal sporadic meteoroids .      as one of the closest cometary approaches to a major planet among known objects ,",
    "we expect the dust tail of c / siding spring to be disrupted by the gravitational field of mars to some degree . to investigate this matter , we integrate a snapshot of the locations of some 12,000 dust particles ( generated from previous simulations under the nominal condition ) from @xmath103 to @xmath104 days ( with @xmath105 being the time of closest approach ) .",
    "the integration is performed with the hnbody package @xcite using the symplectic intergrator , with the barycenter of the martian system included .",
    "the result is shown as figure  [ fig - pert3d ] and [ fig - pertobs ] .",
    "we find that at @xmath106  days , the apparent size of the `` clump '' reaches the order of @xmath107 or 30  as seen on earth , which may be detectable by ground - based telescopes .",
    "we reported the observations and modeling works of c / siding spring , a dynamically new comet that will make a close approach to mars on 2014 oct . 19 . by fitting the observations with syndyne simulations",
    ", we found that the tail of c / siding spring was dominated by larger particles at the time of observation .",
    "synchrone simulation suggested that the particles dominate the optical tail was released by the comet as early as late 2012 , when the comet was more than @xmath108  au from the sun .",
    "we then developed a semi - analytic model to simulate the cometary dust activity .",
    "the modeling result suggested a modest ejection velocity of c / siding spring that is comparable to a few other comets , including p / churyumov - gerasimenko , target of the rosetta mission .    the same model was then used to study the meteoroid influence to mars during the encounter , fed with the constraints found in the previous steps .",
    "we found that the planet will miss the dust cone by some 20 martian radius ( 67,800  km ) under nominal situation .",
    "although the planet may be engulfed by the cometary dust tail if we made an educative guess about the uncertainties and pushed the parameters to the extreme cases , the simulation suggested that the meteoroids reach the vicinity of mars are dominated by non - spacecraft - threatening meteoroids , and the meteoric influx is not significantly higher than the sporadic background influx ; the duration of the event is at the order of 1  hr . from our simulation",
    ", it seems that intense and enduring meteoroid bombardment at mars and its vicinity region is unlikely during the flyby of c / siding spring .",
    "we also study the potential gravitational disruption of the cometary dust tail .",
    "a simple numerical integration suggested that the dust `` clump '' created by the gravitational drag would be at the order of tens of arcsecs at @xmath106  days as seen from the earth which may be detectable by ground - based facilities .    at the time of the writing , c / siding spring",
    "is about 4  au from the sun .",
