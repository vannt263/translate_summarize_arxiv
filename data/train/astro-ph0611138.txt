    "strongly lensed galaxies are particularly useful for studies of galaxy evolution due to the magnification of the galaxy magnitude : since surface brightness is conserved by lensing , the stretching of the galaxy shape increases the apparent brightness of the source galaxy .",
    "these apparently brighter objects are then prime candidates for detailed follow - up studies at a fraction of the telescope time that would be necessary for comparable but unlensed galaxies .    if a strongly lensed galaxy also happens to be a lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) , so much the better .",
    "lbgs are galaxies in which the low - flux region of the spectrum blueward of the ly@xmath18 hydrogen line at 1216  has been redshifted into the @xmath19 band ; lbg samples thus provide a vital window into the galaxy populations of the high redshift ( @xmath20 ) universe ( e.g. , adelberger et al .",
    "1998 , 2003 ; steidel et al .   1998 ; giavalisco et al .  1998 ) .",
    "lbgs , however , are generally rather faint , and detailed studies of these high - redshift galaxies profit from the additional magnification provided for by strong lensing ( nesvadba et al .  2006 ) .",

    "the sdss ( york et al .",

    "the two components of this system are sdss j002240.91 + 143110.4 , which is a luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) , and sdss j002240.78 + 143113.9 , which is a very blue and elongated object .",

    "the resulting spectrum ( fig .",

    "the arc is a very blue high surface brightness object north of the lrg , subtending an angle of @xmath31162about the galaxy .",
    "the arc consists of three components , which are the blue a1 ( sdss j002240.78 + 143113.9 ) the reddish blue a2 ( sdss j002240.96 + 143113.9 ) , and the blue a3 ( sdss j002241.14 + 143112.7 ) .",
    "the arc containing these three components extends over 9.6 in length and has a length to width ratio of 6:1 .",
    "in order to confirm the identification of the system as a gravitational lens , we carried out follow - up imaging and spectroscopy on the astrophysical research consortium ( arc ) 3.5 m at apache point observatory on the night of 2006 august 24 ( ut ) .",
    "the imaging was obtained under photometric conditions and with a seeing of 1.01.2@xmath32 ( fwhm ) during the first half of the night .",

    "three exposures of 300  sec each were obtained in each of the sdss @xmath34 filters ; a 15@xmath32 dithering pattern about the lrg was employed .",

    "the images were then co - added with the swarp package ( bertin 2000 , v2.16 ; see fig .",
    "3 ) , and object detection and measurement were made with sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "we used a weighted coaddition , accounting for flux scaling between the images , and aperture photometry with an aperture of 3@xmath32 .",
    "photometric zeropoints were derived by matching objects detected in the co - added images with objects in the sdss imaging data and comparing their sextractor mag_auto instrumental magnitudes with their sdss model magnitudes .",
    "the @xmath34 magnitudes measured from these co - added images are listed in table 1 .",
    "an astrometric solution for the coadded images was measured relative to the sdss overlapping bright stars in the field of view .",
    "slit spectroscopy was carried out with the dis iii ( dual imaging spectrograph ) using the standard medium red / low blue grating setup during the second half night of night .",
    "six exposures were obtained under moon - less conditions for a total exposure time of 140 min .",
    "the seeing was 1@xmath321.2@xmath32 ( fwhm ) .",
    "a slit width of 1.5was employed , and the slit was oriented to cover as much of the three components of the 8 oclock arc as was possible .",
    "the standard medium red / low blue grating setup covers an effective spectral range of 3600   to 9600   at a linear resolution of 2.43pix@xmath17 in the blue part of the spectrum and 2.26pix@xmath17 in the red ; the spatial scale is 0.4pix@xmath17 .",
    "henear lamp exposures were taken for wavelength calibration . the hst spectrophotometric standard",
    "g191-b2b was observed for flux calibration .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the iraf ccdred package and the doslit task .",
    "the six individual spectroscopic exposures of the 8 oclock arc were combined using the scombine task , and the red and blue spectra were spliced together using the splicespec task from gordon richard s distools external iraf package .",
    "the redshift of the 8 oclock arc was estimated to be @xmath0 based on measurements of ly@xmath18 @xmath35 1215.7 , siii @xmath351260.4 , oi+siii @xmath35(1302.2 + 1304.4 ) , cii @xmath351334.5 , siiv @xmath351393.8 , siiv @xmath351402.8 , siii @xmath351526.7 , civ+civ @xmath351549.5 , and alii @xmath351670.8 , confirming that the arc is indeed a gravitational lens .",

    "we began with a simple mass model to reconstruct the lensing plane .",
    "we used the pixel positions of the three lensed images and the counter image in the coadded spicam @xmath2 band images as measured by sextractor , since the counter image ( a4 ) is not resolved in either the @xmath3 or @xmath4 band coadded images .",
    "the measured positions are shown as blue triangles in figure [ figmodel ] .",
    "we then assumed a singular isothermal ellipse ( sie ) , and used the gravlens / lensmodel software of keeton ( 2001 ) to perform fits ; the resulting fitted position are plotted in figure [ figmodel ] as open boxes .",
    "the best fit sie model yields an einstein radius of @xmath37 , or @xmath38 kpc .",
    "the best fit @xmath39 is 2.1 for ndf=7 , where we assumed positional errors of @xmath400.1 .",
    "since both the redshift of the lrg and the lbg are known we were able to determine the angular diameter distance to the source ( @xmath41 ) , to the lens ( @xmath42 ) , and between the source and lens ( @xmath43 ) , to be 1141 , 752 and 863 @xmath12 mpc , respectively .",
    "the total magnification was found to be a factor of @xmath14 ( @xmath44 for each of the three arc images ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the mass distribution doing the lensing was predicted to be @xmath45  km  s@xmath17 , which is large but not unprecedented for an elliptical galaxy .",
    "( e.g. , crampton et al . 2002 modelled a velocity disperson of 387@xmath405  km  s@xmath17 for the strongly lensed elliptical galaxy cfrs  03.1077 , and bernardi et al .",
    "2006 find @xmath4650 galaxies with @xmath47  km  s@xmath17 from a sdss sample of 39,320 elliptical galaxies . )",
    "the fitted ellipticity and position angle are @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "these fitted values agreed well within 1@xmath50 with the observed values for these parameters for the lrg in the sdss dr4 database ( 0.46 and 12@xmath51 , respectively ) .    from this simple sie model we can determine the mass interior to @xmath52 using @xmath53 .",
    "we find that @xmath54 . as we know the lens distance we can determine the mass - to - light ratio and we find a value of @xmath55 ( @xmath4-band ) .",
    "the spectrum of the 8 oclock arc ( fig .",
    "4 ) shows that the lensed source galaxy is an lbg , albeit an uncommonly bright one : lensed , it is 4.6 mag brighter ( @xmath2-band ) than an @xmath56 lbg ( adelberger & steidel 2000 ) .",
    "even after accounting for a lensing magnification of @xmath57 (   [ sec : model ] ) , the 8 oclock arc is 1.9 mag ( @xmath31 a factor of 6 ) more luminous than @xmath56 for lbgs .    for comparison ,",
    "cb58 is a typical @xmath56 lbg lensed by the large @xmath58 foreground cluster ms 1512 + 36 ( yee et al .",
    "furthermore , cb58 is magnified by a factor of @xmath46 30 and has an apparent brightness only about one - third that of the 8 oclock arc ( seitz et al .",
    "we also note that the relative simplicity of the environment surrounding the 8 oclock arc s lensing lrg permits a quite robust determination of the lensing amplification , whereas the lensing amplification for cb58 is rather sensitive to the assumed cluster mass distribution model .",
    "we can also estimate the star formation rate of the 8 oclock arc lbg using a scaling relation given in pettini et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "the relation is given for cb58 but for the accuracy necessary here we can take cb58 and the 8 oclock arc to be at the same redshift : @xmath59 where the additional factor of 3 over the pettini et al .",
    "relation ( their eq .",
    "[ 6 ] ) takes into account the fact the 8 oclock arc s total apparent brightness is roughly three times that of cb58 .",
    "for the 8 oclock arc , @xmath60 and we take the other parameters to be the same , leading to sfr @xmath61 ( @xmath62 = 70 km  s@xmath17  mpc@xmath17 and @xmath63=0.1 ) , or sfr @xmath64 ( @xmath65 , @xmath26 ) . this should be taken as an estimate only , as the pettini et al .",
    "relation is based upon uv continuum luminosity and gives the highest of all the star formation rate estimates for cb58 .",
    "followup measurements of the 8 oclock will provide more detailed rate estimates . taking the estimate at face value ,",
    "the 8 oclock arc is in the top @xmath66 of star formation rates given for lbgs in shapley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "understanding the environment of the lrg and the lensed lbg is critical for interpreting the results of the gravitational lens modeling .",
    "therefore , we have run maxbcg cluster finder ( koestler et al .",
    "2006 ) on the area .",
    "the lrg sits near a maxbcg cluster , with a center at ( @xmath18,@xmath67)@xmath68 = ( 5.6749,14.5003 ) and a photometric redshift of @xmath69 and richness @xmath70 .",
    "this is a reasonably massive cluster , and the lensing lrg sits just 260 kpc from the brightest cluster galaxy .",
    "this may give an additional sheet surface mass contribution to the lensing , but it is likely that this is a very small effect ( kochanek , private communication ) .",
    "we have reported on the discovery of a strongly lensed lbg at a redshift of @xmath0 , the arc of which we have named the `` 8 oclock arc . '' at an apparent magnitude of ( @xmath2,@xmath3,@xmath4 ) @xmath5 ( 19.95,19.22,18.98 ) , it displaces cb58 as the brightest known lbg by over a magnitude .",
    "the arc consists of three lensed images of the lbg and subtends a length of 162(9.6 ) around the the lensing galaxy , an early type galaxy at @xmath1 .",
    "the length - to - width ratio of the arc is 6:1 .",
    "a fourth ( counter ) image is also visible in the co - added arc 3.5 m @xmath2-band image .    a simple sie lens model for the system yields an einstein radius of @xmath71 ( @xmath72 @xmath12  kpc ) , a total lensing mass within the einstein radius of @xmath73 , and a magnification factor for the lbg of @xmath14 . based upon this model s value for the magnification factor ,",
    "it is clear that the lbg is not only apparently bright but also quite intrinsically luminous ( about @xmath74 ) .",
    "furthermore , a simple scaling relation from pettini et al .  ( 2000 ) indicates that the lbg may be experiencing an episode of vigorous star formation , perhaps as high as 160 @xmath16 yr@xmath17 .",
