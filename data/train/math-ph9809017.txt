    "[ [ some - history ] ] some history + + + + + + + + + + + +    i should say some words about the history of discrete gravity .",
    "classical gravity deals with a smooth ( not necessarily four - dimensional ) manifold @xmath1 , pseudo - metric tensor @xmath2 on it and the classical einstein - hilbert action @xmath3 the various stationary points of which are studied . here",
    "@xmath4 is the intrinsic curvature at the point @xmath5 , @xmath6 - some functional of matter fields @xmath7 . in the pure ( no matter ) gravity case @xmath8",
    ", we consider only this case here .",
    "quantum gravity takes into account not only stationary points but also all other configurations with some weights , that is with a formal ( but which becomes positive for euclidean metrics ) density @xmath9 on some configuration space @xmath10 of matter fields and metric tensors .",
    "all earlier attempts to do this brought the conclusion that @xmath10 should also include smooth structures on @xmath1 and even @xmath1 itself , that is the space , its topology , should be random .",
    "now the only reasonable way to pursue this program is to discretize everything from the beginning and then to perform some scaling limits . that is the space becomes a finite complex",
    ", smooth structure becomes a piecewise linear structure , metrics and curvature are encrypted in one - dimensional and two - dimensional skeletons of the complex , matter fields are spins which live on the cells of the complex .",
    "it appears that such quantization ( discretization ) is equally applicable to other physical systems : relativistic particles , strings etc . , but with different interpretations .",
    "for example , the quantized ( in such a way ) string consists of a two - dimensional complex ( representing a coordinate system and metrics on the string itself ) and spins - vectors in @xmath11 which provide a mapping of the vertices of the complex into the @xmath12-dimensional euclidean space , thus approximating the classical string .",
    "the discretization of the classical gravity was first considered by regge @xcite where he gave definitions of some exact mathematical objects related to the classical general relativity : finite discrete space time , its curvature and einstein - hilbert action .",
    "it was afterwards included in the fundamental monograph @xcite but in seventies it was still considered outside of the main streamline of physics and only rare papers were devoted to it . among them",
    "however there was a well known paper by s. hawking @xcite where the applications to quantum gravity were discussed .",
    "in eighties there are already more than 100 papers concerning discrete quantum gravity .    in nineties",
    "the the number of papers is more than 1000 and still grows at the moment .",
    "mainly it is due to the appearing algebraic formal techniques to deal with such problems .",
    "this formal techniques follows physical insights on relations of quantum gravity with string theory , random matrix models etc .",
    "moreover , recent papers in theoretical physics often contain the following sententions :  two - dimensional random geometry is now placed at the heart of many models of modern physics , from string theory and two - dimensional quantum gravity , attempting to describe fundamental interactions , to membranes and interface fluctuations in various problems of condensed matter physics ",
    ", see @xcite .    for a probabilist",
    "the quantum gravity is a source of inspiration and also new mathematics and new philosophy of probability .",
    "the paper can serve an introduction to quantum gravity for a probabilist : it is a mathematical text on the quantum gravity for the planar pure gravity case .    [",
    "[ dynamics - contre - equilibrium ] ] dynamics contre equilibrium + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    mostly we consider combinatorial techniques , instead of more popular in physics random matrix models , the central point is the famous @xmath13 exponent .",
    "another goal of the paper is to consider stochastic dynamics which leaves quantum gravity equilibrium distribution invariant .",
    "we start theoretical study of this dynamics ( earlier it was only used for monte - carlo simulation ) .",
    "the study of dynamics constitutes ( but mainly it is self - contained ) a third part of the series of papers ( see @xcite ) where more general class of processes was studied .",
    "these processes have also some universal character in probability : they cover most concrete processes .",
    "also they have many examples in computer science and biology .    here the probability is the classical probability .",
    "the quantum gravity constitutes a bunch ( a lot ! ) of papers overfilling last 10 years well - known physical journals .",
    "discrete quantum gravity is now considered as a promising direction towards unifying largest and smallest scales in the nowadays picture of nature .",
    "i consider one part of this field which evidently uses probabilistic intuition but it is difficult to find even formulations ( i do not mention proofs ! ) which could be satisfactory for a mathematician : even when the  probabilities  are hopefully positive they are not normalized . and this is not because of negligence of the authors but because some deep reasons seem to be behind the curtains .    in the existing physical literature",
    "a permanently developing algebraic and geometric techniques overwhelms the subject .",
    "thus it can be useful to step away from algebra and geometry , discussing some simple probabilistic aspects of quantum gravity : even such simple project appeared to rise many natural but still not answered questions .",
    "there are now two variants in the discrete approaches to quantum gravity : quantum regge calculus ( where links ( edges ) have lengths as random variables ) and dynamical triangulations ( where lengths of edges are constant ) . the word _ dynamical _ in the second approach is a little bit misleading because there is no dynamics at all in this approach : main techniques uses gibbs equilibrium distributions on large matrices .",
    "that is why i will call here these approaches equilibrium .",
    "the dynamics appeared earlier in monte carlo simulations of quantum gravity .",
    "here i try to give a probabilistic ( not numerical ) study of relevant markov processes .",
    "what is new here ( i  do not know earlier rigorous results ) is that we want to advocate not numerical but analytic and probabilistic studies of such processes .",
    "why such processes can be useful not only in computer monte - carlo experiments but also as giving theoretical information ?",
    "there are many reasons - we give here a short list .    *",
    "well known difficulty in averaging over all topologies is that , in 4 dimensions , it includes some questions which are known to be algorithmically unsolvable .",
    "dynamics substitutes this problem with a new one : instead of averaging we are looking for a process ( with arbitrary initial state ) which will generate all topologies it can generate .",
    "this process should have some symmetries but also it should be a legitimate ( for example non - exploding ) stochastic process . *",
    "what one would like to have ( as in the stochastic quantization in quantum field theory and glauber dynamics in statistical mechanics ) is a markov process leaving gibbs measure invariant .",
    "this is quite natural in quantum field theory where there are whiteman axioms and in statistical mechanics where there is a deterministic dynamics more fundamental than the gibbs measure itself . in quantum gravity",
    "both these factors are absent and an alternative viewpoint could be advertised : that the process itself can be taken to be more fundamental than the gibbs measure itself . *",
    "dynamics allows to consider the region below the critical point where equilibrium distribution has no sense . on the contrary",
    "this region is even more natural for the dynamics - like a growing universe ( in the computer time , the term which i know from a paper by a. migdal ) .",
    "moreover dynamics gives also some sense to distributions in the critical point without performing scaling limits .",
    "i do not know the physical counterpart of all this but its naturalness from probability point of view is evident .",
    "* i have absolutely no physical arguments for the choice and even relevance of the dynamical models , but that is also true for all modern approaches due to the lack of experimental confirmation .",
    "the leading thread can only be probabilistic intuition and beauty .",
    "relevant question are : what is universality and generic situation ?",
    "it was argued recently , see @xcite , that computer science could play some role in future physical theories .",
    "probabilistic aspects which we discuss here make this relation quite evident by a preliminary model of the universe growing via some grammar ( more exactly a graph grammar ) similarly to the random evolution of a language . *",
    "mathematical thermodynamic theory existing for statistical mechanics and quantum theory brought many new ideas .",
    "it is some surprise that an attempt to construct similar theory for growing complexes brought quite unexpected phenomena ( see @xcite,@xcite ) ( hopefully having some physical significance ) .",
    "one of the effects is that one can not fix an origin in an infinite universe without zermelo axiom , any constructive introducing of a local observer changes drastically the space time in his neighborhood .",
    "* it can not be easy to find critical exponents by monte - carlo simulation because the asymptotic is dominated by the exponential term which depends strongly on the details of the model .",
    "what is usually simulated is the uniform distribution on the set of triangulations with fixed number of cells .",
    "if we consider a growing complex then we could not find a markov process giving the necessary exponents ( the famous @xmath13 ) but only some random transformation of measures , that is called usually a nonlinear markov processes , giving these exponents .",

    "but it is quite different from the classical random walks .",
    "we shall see below its relationship with some computer science problems .",
    "we shall also see how this formal object can be tied to the euclidean space : in physical papers one can also see similar steps - abstract object ( random triangulation , internal metrics etc . )",

    "we want to compare @xmath774 and @xmath775 , for this we iterate the latter recurrent equation for @xmath775 to the very end , that is we get the sum of terms @xmath776 , in each of them all factors equal @xmath777 for some @xmath727 .",

    "we make an assumption that a move can only be done if it gives non - equivalent complex .",
    "we formulate the following lemma without proof .",
    "the following example shows that large time and large @xmath57 limits are not interchangeable , that is @xmath793 for local quantities .",
    "this the simulation is slow and dangerous in this case . consider the sequence of such chains @xmath794 having the embedded state spaces @xmath795 take a vertex @xmath235 at time @xmath35 and consider random variables @xmath796 - number of edges at @xmath235 at time @xmath108 .",
    "we have @xmath797 and it could be natural to think that @xmath798 .",
    "but the following argument shows more complicated situation .      proof . for fixed @xmath57 the process @xmath796 is markov with state space @xmath801 with rates @xmath799 .",
    "in fact , each edge incident to @xmath235 can be changed to a transversal and , for each triangle containing @xmath235 , its edge not containing @xmath235 can be erased by gv - move , this will give one more incident edge .",
    "the limiting random walk is null recurrent and thus big fluctuations in it occur until it reaches equilibrium for fixed @xmath57 .",
    "now consider markov chains where the only transitions are a - moves .  to get ergodic chains we change the generator which produces jumps",

    "let @xmath277 be the rate of the inverse a - move at vertex @xmath157 , also for each possible vertex @xmath235 of degree @xmath425 on @xmath804 with equal probability we take one pair of triangles ( on the right hand side of the a - move ) and do the inverse a - move .",
    "once the vertex @xmath157 appeared it can disappear afterwards .",
    "let @xmath805 the time when vertex @xmath157 appeared .      proof .",

    "two edges ( marked 1 on the figure ) appear on some link ( @xmath817 on the figure ) .",
    "thus here the transition is @xmath818 with rate @xmath819 . here and further factor @xmath260 because the same move can be produced also by the opposite vertex .",
    "inverse move @xmath820 with rate @xmath821 ; 2 .",
