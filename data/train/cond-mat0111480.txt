    "<S> for @xmath35 there are only two pairs of real poles : @xmath36 and @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the poles at @xmath38 originate from the singularities of the dos of the bcs superconductors .    </S>",
    "<S> the poles at @xmath39 come from the qd s green function and are two real roots of the equation @xmath40 inside the gap ( @xmath41 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these two poles give the positions of the quasi - particle states of the qd inside the gap . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that they are real indicates that these two quasi - particle states are exactly bound states , usually called the andreev bound states ( abs ) .    before coupling to the superconductors , the unperturbed qd has a bound state at @xmath42 for the electron spectrum and one at @xmath43  for the hole spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> after coupled to the superconductors , through the electron - transfer with the two superconductors via andreev process , the electron part and the hole part of the qd s green function are coupled together , and give rise to significant modifications to the qd s energy spectrum : the original bound state at @xmath42 for electron ( or @xmath44 for hole ) renormalizes into two symmetrical  bound states at @xmath45 for both electron and hole spectrum .    to express @xmath46 as the algebraic function of @xmath42 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , we transform the equation @xmath40 into a quartic equation of @xmath49 @xmath50 : </S>",

    "<S> _ discussion . </S>",
    "<S> _ in addition to the splitting of the original energy level @xmath67 into the two abs , another modification to the qd s energy spectrum is that the qd begins to have a continuum energy spectrum outside the gap . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , one way to calculate the current integral ( @xmath68\\}$ ] ) is to divide the qd s spectrum into the continuum part ( @xmath69 ) and the discrete part ( @xmath70 ) , and then evaluate their contributions to the current separately . </S>",
    "<S> however , this method involves a numerical integration and faces the problem of explaining why the peaks at @xmath36 in @xmath71 vs. @xmath42 curve and in @xmath72 vs. @xmath42 curve exactly cancel out when the two parts add up to give the total current , see fig.1 .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , from our approach , this exact cancellation can be shown naturally . </S>",
    "<S> the current is obtained by adding the residues of the four poles . </S>",
    "<S> since the residues at @xmath63 vanish , the total current curve has no peaks arising from the dos singularities of the superconductors .    </S>",
    "<S> now only residues at @xmath73 contribute to the total current and give rise to a sharp peak in @xmath74 vs. @xmath42 curve at @xmath75 the reason for the appearance of the peak at @xmath76 is that when @xmath77 , the upper and the lower abs have same phase . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath42 departs from the fermi level , the phase of the upper and lower abs begins to differ and this difference severely reduces the supercurrent across the junction . </S>",
    "<S> fig.2 shows the central peaks at different @xmath78 the peaks broaden when @xmath48 increases .    </S>",
    "<S> a direct application of this result is a way to align the energy level of the qd to the fermi level of the superconductor in the actual experiment : when changing the gate voltage , the state with the maximum supercurrent is at @xmath79    _ conclusion . _ in summary , we have calculated analytically the supercurrent across an s - qd - s junction . </S>",
    "<S> the central results are eq.[18 ] and eq.[21 ] . </S>",
    "<S> they give the analytical result of both the positions of abs and the supercurrent . </S>",
    "<S> we show two additional advantages of our method : ( 1 ) it presents a natural definition of the andreev bound states inside the qd . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) it explains the disappearance of the peaks at the gap edge in @xmath74 vs. @xmath67 curve .  </S>",
    "<S> the method devised in the paper can also be used in computing other equilibrium properties of the superconductor - normal hybrid systems .    </S>",
