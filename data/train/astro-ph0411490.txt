    "* hereafter ct00 ) studied the projected properties of a family of mass models which are triaxial generalisation of modified hubble mass model .",
    "the model was first proposed by @xcite as a numerical model for a triaxial stellar system in dynamical equilibrium and later casted into analytical form by @xcite .",
    "it was found by ct00 that these models show ellipticity variations and isophotal twists in their projections along the line of sight .",
    "moreover , the radial profiles of the parameters of the elliptical isophotes were found to be smooth functions of the radius ( see ct00 ) .",
    "however , many elliptical galaxies , devoid of any features , indicating the absence of shells or dust , are found to exhibit small scale variations in the radial profiles of the parameters of elliptical isophotes .",
    "this indicates that density distributions of such ellipticals may be more complex than that of ct00 .",
    "above fact inspired us to modify the models of ct00 by adding the additional radial functions , each multiplied by a low - order spherical harmonic .",
    "the projected surface density @xmath2 of resultant mass model can be calculated analytically .",
    "this makes possible to investigate some of the projected properties analytically .",
    "we calculated the profiles of surface density @xmath2 , axial ratio @xmath3 and position angle @xmath4 of the major axis as functions of radius .",
    "the analytical expression of the @xmath2 is very useful for the calculations of @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in the asymptotic regions analytical expressions",
    "can be derived , while in the intermediate regions simple numerical methods can be adopted for these calculations .",
    "the inclusions of additional terms in the density distribution , allows us to produce varieties of the radial profile of @xmath3 and @xmath4 that can be compared with photometric data of real galaxies .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that the observed ellipticities and the position angle , at small and at large radii can be used to derive the intrinsic axial ratios of the mass model , as a function of the viewing angles .",
    "since the viewing angles of galaxies are largely unknown , it will be worth - while to get an estimate of the intrinsic axial ratios independent of the viewing angles . in this regard , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sf94 ) , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter tc01 ) found that in case the observed parameters exhibit correlations when a model with a given set of intrinsic parameters is viewed in all possible orientations , one can obtain a probable estimate of the intrinsic shape , independent of the viewing angles .",
    "furthermore , it was also shown by tc01 that the intrinsic shapes of triaxial mass models can be estimated using photometric properties and further , the results of shape estimation would be insensitive to the choice of models , if one considers ensembles of models which represent above mentioned correlations between the observed parameters .",
    "thus , another aim of our present study is to build ensembles of models showing the correlations between observed parameters so that one could get an estimate of model independent shape .    in  2",

    "the isodensity contours of many real elliptical galaxies show such small scale variations in the profiles of @xmath3 and @xmath4 as functions of @xmath101 rather than the smooth monotonically increasing or decreasing profiles of @xmath3 and @xmath4 as those found in ct00 .",
    "this suggests that the radial profiles of @xmath3 and @xmath4 of our present traixial models , as a function of viewing angles @xmath56 , can be compared with observations .",

    "it is interesting to note here that our model with remaining four values of @xmath122 also show the qualitatively similar correlations as those found in fig .",

    "[ fig : fig4 ] , we have presented them for only two choices of @xmath139 and @xmath140 in figs . [ fig : fig5 ] and [ fig : fig6 ] , respectively .",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "although some differences in the patterns between a highly prolate and a highly oblate triaxial are exhibited , they occupy overlapping regions .",
    "this suggests that @xmath146 is not a suitable observed parameter to develop well - separated correlations for two different choices of @xmath138 required for the shape determination .",
    "but the non - overlapping correlations between the observed parameters @xmath133 and @xmath134 are appeared to be useful in the prediction of the intrinsic shapes of the mass models by mean of the graphical method of shape estimate of sf94 .    despite the radial profiles of projected properties of our models",

    "to get more insight over this issue , an experiment to recover the intrinsic shape of a model galaxy is presented in the next section where we have used bayesian statistics and exploited the correlations by employing the above mentioned observed parameters and ensembles of models .      in order to get an estimate of the intrinsic shape of a model galaxy , we followed ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "<S> the projected properties of triaxial generalization of the modified hubble mass models are studied . </S>",
    "<S> these models are constructed by adding the additional radial functions , each multiplied by a low - order spherical harmonic , to the models of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the projected surface density of mass models can be calculated analytically which allows us to derive the analytic expressions of axial ratio and position angles of major axis of constant density elliptical contours at asymptotic radii . </S>",
    "<S> the models are more general than those studied earlier in the sense that the inclusions of additional terms in density distribution , allows one to produce varieties of the radial profile of axial ratio and position angle , in particular , their small scale variations at inner radii . </S>",
    "<S> strong correlations are found to exist between the observed axial ratio evaluated at @xmath0 and at @xmath1 which occupy well - separated regions in the parameter space for different choices of the intrinsic axial ratios . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations can be exploited to predict the intrinsic shape of the mass model , independent of the viewing angles . </S>",
    "<S> using bayesian statistics , the result of a test case launched for an estimation of the shape of a model galaxy is found to be satisfactory .    ,    ,    ,    galaxies : triaxial - galaxies : photometry - galaxies : structure . </S>"
