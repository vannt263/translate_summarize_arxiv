    "non - relativistic particle physics is often associated with atomic physics , the interactions between nuclei , and the low - energy phenomena of the strong interactions of the charm and bottom quarks , which form quarkonium bound states .",
    "but non - relativistic dynamics also governs the interactions of weak - scale particles such as the top quark or the hypothetical supersymmetric partners of the standard model ( sm ) particles , when they are slowly moving . in this review",
    "we cover three topics in contemporary high - energy physics where the unique non - relativistic dynamics caused by instantaneous , potential interactions plays an important if not defining role : the production of top - quark pairs in electron - positron collisions in the threshold region , which can provide a measurement of the top - quark mass with unchallenged precision and could be realized at a future high - energy @xmath0 collider .",
    "the hadronic pair production of top quarks at tevatron and lhc , or yet unobserved heavy particles at the lhc , where in addition to the coulomb force soft gluon radiation contributes to enhanced quantum corrections , which should be summed . and finally , the pair annihilation of dark matter particles within the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "while the first two processes are determined by the long - range colour coulomb force , the low - velocity annihilation of heavy neutralinos in the mssm can be dramatically enhanced by the short - range electroweak yukawa force generated by the exchange of gauge and higgs bosons .",
    "we discuss the phenomena and results but also emphasize theoretical methods and techniques .",
    "since there is always a small relative velocity @xmath1 in the problem , non - relativistic systems involve ( at least ) the three scales @xmath2 ( mass ) , @xmath3 ( momentum ) , @xmath4 ( energy ) , and it is appropriate to formulate effective lagrangians to organize the calculation , even if the underlying theory  qcd , the sm , or the mssm  is known .",
    "the three topics discussed here have further in common that the relevant lagrangian couplings are weak at all three scales .",
    "this allows for a systematic treatment with approximations of well - defined parametric accuracy , even though ordinary perturbation theory in the coupling breaks down , as will be discussed .",
    "each of the three topics provides its own specific challenges . in top - quark pair production near threshold in @xmath0 collisions , it is the high precision of the envisioned mass measurement , which demands calculations with unprecedented third - order accuracy in the non - relativistic approximation that can be achieved by a combination of effective field theory and multi - loop techniques . in hadronic production",
    "the required precision is less , but the coloured partonic initial state of quarks and gluons implies that soft - gluon resummation must be integrated into the non - relativistic expansion , and a more general treatment of colour is needed for final states which can be produced in various colour representations .",
    "dark matter ( dm ) annihilation involves yet another issue .",
    "the non - relativistic `` sommerfeld '' enhancements from electroweak gauge boson exchange are operative only , when the dm particles are in the tev range , such that the inverse bohr radius scale is of order of or larger than the mass of the electroweak gauge bosons . for such heavy , weakly interacting particles , the mass splitting between the members of the electroweak multiplet",
    "are small , so that co - annihilation effects at dark matter freeze - out are generic .",
    "while the non - relativistic treatment is only performed at leading - order , the complexity of the problem arises from a large number of interacting two - particle states , kinematically closed channels in the schrdinger problem , which must be solved numerically , and the large number of final states that contribute to the pair annihilation cross section in a model such as the mssm .",
    "the outline of this review is as follows : in the next section we briefly summarize several methods and technical tools , which are necessary to perform the calculations . in particular , we briefly describe the threshold expansion , introduce nrqcd and pnrqcd , and mention a few details in connection to the underlying multi - loop calculations .",
    "section  [ sec:3 ] is devoted to the top - quark pair production cross section near threshold in @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "we introduce the main ingredients in the third - order calculation and discuss the numerical results . in section  [ sec:4 ] top - quark and supersymmetric pair production is considered at hadron colliders . after describing the joint soft and coulomb resummation formalism , the top - pair invariant mass distribution near threshold is considered .",
    "we then summarize results on the resummed total top and susy pair production cross sections , and compare it to fixed - order results , and results with soft - gluon but without coulomb resummation .",
    "section  [ sec:5 ] leads through the effective field theory treatment of sommerfeld enhancement in dark matter annihilation with a short discussion of a method to determine the enhancement reliably in situations with several channels without extreme degeneracies .",
    "we also highlight a few results for a wino - like dark matter particle and a series of models that interpolates from a higgsino- to wino - like neutralino .",
    "we conclude our review with a summary in section  [ sec : sum ] .",
    "before addressing more specifically the three topics of this review , we summarize the main methods and techniques .      close to the production threshold of two heavy particles ( for simplicity , with equal masses ) there are three characteristic scales : the mass of the particle , @xmath2 , its three - momentum of order @xmath5 , and the kinetic energy @xmath6 .",
    "for example , for top quarks we have @xmath7  gev , @xmath8  gev and @xmath9  gev , and thus a strong hierarchy among the scales .",
    "furthermore , @xmath10 , which means that the strong coupling @xmath11 is always in the perturbative regime . in this review ,",
    "we only consider systems where this condition is satisfied .",
    "the presence of the small parameter @xmath1 leads to a breakdown of the standard perturbation expansion in @xmath12 due to kinematic @xmath13 enhancements .",
    "a reorganized , non - relativistic expansion must be used , where both @xmath12 and @xmath1 are simultaneously considered as small but @xmath14 of order one . in terms of feynman diagrams , a summation of certain terms to all orders in @xmath12 is required .",
    "at the same time , since @xmath1 is small , one does not need the full dependence on @xmath1 of every fixed - order diagram .    for a given feynman diagram",
    "the expansion in @xmath1 can be constructed without first computing the full expression using the threshold expansion  @xcite .",
    "the method exploits that every diagram can be decomposed into a sum of terms , for which each loop momentum is in one of the following four momentum regions : @xmath15 in each region the integrand of the feynman diagram is expanded in the small parameters of the respective region . afterwards the loop integration over the complete @xmath16-dimensional space - time volume is performed .",
    "the property of dimensional regularization that scaleless integrals vanish , guarantees that no double counting occurs .",
    "the arguments in favour of this construction provided in  @xcite rely on assumptions on the location of singularities in the feynman integrand and examples .",
    "further justification can be found in @xcite .",
    "it may happen that the separation of the integrand into regions generates spurious ultraviolet and infrared divergences .",
    "however , they cancel in the sum of all contributions .",
    "the procedure described in the previous subsection is essentially equivalent to the explicit construction of effective non - relativistic lagrangians within dimensional regularization , since the terms that arise in the threshold expansion can be interpreted as modified propagators and vertices . in a certain sense",
    ", the threshold expansion defines these lagrangians in dimensional regularization by providing the precise rules for performing consistent matching calculations .",
    "to be definite , we refer to a system of a heavy quark ( q ) and antiquark interacting via gluons .",
    "the effective lagrangians are constructed in two steps following the following scheme for integrating out momentum modes : + @xmath17 & \\mu >",

    "the first step leads to nrqcd  @xcite .",
    "its lagrangian has the following structure @xmath21 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where explicit expressions of the individual contributions can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the bilinear heavy - quark lagrangians @xmath22 and @xmath23 contain the kinetic terms for the two - component quark and antiquark fields @xmath24 and @xmath25 and the interactions with the chromomagnetic field in an expansion up to including terms of order @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 contains four - fermion quark - antiquark terms and @xmath28 is the pure gluon part , again expanded in @xmath29 . finally , @xmath30 is the same as the light - quark lagrangian in full qcd .",
    "the feynman rules derived from the lagrangian  ( [ nrqcd ] ) can , e.g. , be found in  @xcite .",
    "all matching coefficients relevant for a third - order calculation can also be found in  @xcite .",
    "a subtlety that is explained there in detail is that the short - distance coefficient functions of the operators in the nrqcd lagrangian must be kept @xmath16-dimensional in dimensional regularization .    in the second matching step in the above scheme",
    "soft modes and potential massless modes are integrated out .",
    "it has been suggested in the context of the threshold expansion in  @xcite and at the level of an effective lagrangian in  @xcite .",
    "the result is the so - called potential nrqcd ( pnrqcd ) lagrangian developed in various forms in  @xcite .",
    "it only contains ultrasoft light fields and potential heavy quarks , which simplifies the scaling in the velocity expansion .",
    "note that since the components of the hard momentum integrated out in the first matching step are larger than those of the modes in the effective theory , the nrqcd lagrangian is local .",
    "this can no longer be expected for pnrqcd .",
    "however , since only the three - momentum of the potential modes @xmath31 is of order of the soft scale @xmath3 , the non - locality of the pnrqcd lagrangian refers only to space but not to time .",
    "the relevant terms in the pnrqcd lagrangian are given by  @xcite    @xmath32(x+{\\bf r } ) \\",

    "the first two terms of @xmath35 contain the kinetic terms including the relativistic corrections and the third term is responsible for heavy - quark potential interactions .",
    "note that the heavy - quark potentials generated in the matching to pnrqcd enter this term as short - distance coefficients of the spatially non - local but temporally local , i.e. instantaneous , pnrqcd interactions .",
    "ultrasoft interactions between the heavy quarks and the gluon field are contained in the last two terms of  ( [ eq : pnrqcd ] ) and the @xmath36 terms in the first line .",
    "the latter do not contribute to colour - singlet production of a @xmath37 pair , in which case ultrasoft effects enter for the first time at third order in non - relativistic perturbation theory .",
    "perturbation theory in pnrqcd closely resembles quantum - mechanical perturbation theory , since the leading colour - coulomb interaction is part of the unperturbed theory .",
    "thus , the propagator of pnrqcd includes the leading coulomb interaction exactly , which effects the required resummation of conventional perturbation theory to all orders .",
    "the pnrqcd feynman rules can again be found in  @xcite .",
    "the computation of matching coefficients with high precision involves fixed - order multi - loop calculations .",
    "for the topics reviewed in this article , the highest order is demanded in the calculation of the three - loop corrections to the static potential and the matching coefficient between qcd and nrqcd of the vector current . for calculations of this type",
    "it is necessary to have a high level of automation , which reaches from the generation of the feynman diagrams to the final summation and expansion in @xmath38 .",
    "the scheme used for the three - loop vector - current matching coefficient requires particularly little manual interaction and is described in detail in  @xcite .    for the generation of the contributing feynman diagrams we use the fortran program qgraf  @xcite .",
    "the output is passed via q2e  @xcite , which transforms feynman diagrams into feynman amplitudes , to exp  @xcite that generates form  @xcite code .",
    "at the same time a topology is assigned to each diagram .",
    "the form code is processed to perform traces , apply projectors , and map the resulting scalar expressions to functions , which have a one - to - one relation to the topologies .",
    "they contain the exponents of the involved propagators as arguments . at this point",
    "one has in general a large number of different functions .",
    "thus , in a next step one passes them to a program which implements the laporta algorithm  @xcite and performs a reduction to a small number of so - called master integrals .",
    "the latter have to be computed using analytical or numerical methods . in the case of the three - loop corrections to the static potential",
    "all but three coefficients in the @xmath38 expansion could be computed analytically .",
    "for the three - loop corrections to the matching coefficient a significant number of integrals have been evaluated numerically using the program fiesta  @xcite , which is based on sector decomposition .",
    "top - quark pair production near threshold in @xmath0 annihilation provides a unique possibility to measure a number of parameters with high precision . among them",
    "are the top - quark mass and width , the strong coupling constant , and the top - quark yukawa coupling .",
    "in particular the mass determination attracts lot of attention , since the current uncertainty can be improved by about an order of magnitude , and at the same time the renormalization scheme is precisely defined . to reach this goal precise predictions",
    "are needed including both qcd and electroweak higher order corrections .",
    "the top - antitop system near threshold involves only scales in the perturbative regime  @xcite , which allows for systematic approximations .",
    "next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) qcd corrections have been computed at the end of the 1990s by several independent groups  @xcite .",
    "the results are summarized and compared in  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the nnlo corrections led to a significant shift of the cross section , and the theoretical uncertainty estimated through scale dependence remained larger than naively expected .",
    "the prospect of an accurate mass measurement at a future high - energy @xmath0 collider therefore makes it mandatory to push the theoretical calculation to the third order .    in this section",
    "we sketch the computation of the cross section @xmath39 close to threshold to third order in non - relativistic perturbation theory .",

    "in particular , we describe in section  [ sub::c3 ] the calculation of the three - loop corrections to the matching coefficient @xmath46 and in section  [ sub::a3 ] the three - loop corrections to the static potential .",

    "section  [ sub::further ] contains further results , in particular a discussion of higgs boson contributions at order @xmath55 , of p - wave effects and of non - resonant contributions .",
    "one ingredient of the n@xmath56lo corrections to top - quark threshold production is the three - loop matching coefficient between qcd and nrqcd .",

    "in this last section we turn to a potentially important non - relativistic effect in the pair annihilation of dark matter ( dm ) particles . while the nature and origin of dark matter are still unknown it is intriguing that the observed abundance can be explained rather naturally as thermal relic of a tev scale particle with weak interaction strength .",
    "the relic density is determined by the total annihilation cross section , @xmath354 , averaged over the velocity distribution of the particles . since the abundance froze out when the temperature of the universe was about @xmath355 , where @xmath356 is the dm particle mass , the typical velocities @xmath357 are non - relativistic . when dm particles annihilate in the present universe , potentially revealing themselves in cosmic ray signatures , the typical velocities are @xmath358 , and the annihilation occurs even deeper in the non - relativistic regime .",
    "for heavy , weakly interacting , tev - scale dark matter the exchange of the electroweak gauge ( and higgs ) bosons between the slowly moving dm particles generates a yukawa potential , which leads to an enhancement of ladder diagrams .",
    "unlike the case of the long - range coulomb potential due to gluon or photon exchange discussed up to now , the enhancement does not increase as @xmath359 at very small velocities , but is cut off at @xmath360 by the mass of the mediator particle . nevertheless , additional particle exchange is not suppressed by the size of the electroweak coupling @xmath361 when the dm mass is much larger than the mediator mass .",
    "this so - called sommerfeld effect can exceed the lowest - order annihilation cross section by orders of magnitude .",
    "the yukawa potential has only a finite number of bound states of order @xmath362 .",
    "when the dark matter mass is varied , resonant enhancements of the dm pair scattering wave - functions occur whenever a bound state approaches the threshold , which can yield pronounced sommerfeld enhancements stronger than in the coulomb case .",
    "the relevance of the sommerfeld effect was first pointed out for ( wino- or higgsino - like ) neutralino dm annihilation into two photons  @xcite , and subsequently for relic - density calculations  @xcite , although it was not until 2008 , when an anomalous positron excess was measured by pamela , that sommerfeld enhanced dm models attracted more attention as a mechanism to boost the dm annihilation rates  @xcite .",
    "we note that for heavy dark matter with mass far above the electroweak scale , the mass splittings between the states of the dm electroweak multiplet are naturally in the gev or sub - gev range . at freeze - out a multitude of co - annihilation processes , including charged states are still active , and sommerfeld enhancements are generic .",
    "this occurs in particular in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "sommerfeld enhancements in cosmic ray signatures and in the thermal relic abundance have therefore been discussed extensively for relevant mssm scenarios with neutralino dm  @xcite , but also for generic multi - state dark matter models  @xcite .    in the following",
    "we summarize the work of @xcite , which aims at improving the calculation of the dark - matter annihilation cross section and relic abundance by including the sommerfeld radiative corrections in the general mssm , beyond the previously considered wino- and higgsino - limit , where the neutralino can be an arbitrary admixture of the electroweak wino , higgsino and bino states .",
    "as in previous sections a non - relativistic effective theory ( of the mssm ) is constructed to separate the short - distance annihilation process from the long - distance sommerfeld effect , which is encoded in the matrix elements of local four - fermion operators .",

    "[ figure : courtesy c. hellmann],width=245 ]    the presence of several particle species @xmath367 entails many complications . since electroweak gauge boson exchange may change the two - particle state ( for instance , scatter a neutralino pair into a pair of oppositely charged , nearly degenerate , charginos ) , the short - distance annihilation process is described by a matrix in the space of two - particle states , which is not diagonal .",
    "the off - diagonal terms can not be obtained from the tree - level cross sections computed by numerical programs .",

    "<S> non - relativistic physics is often associated with atomic physics and low - energy phenomena of the strong interactions between nuclei and quarks . in this review </S>",
    "<S> we cover three topics in contemporary high - energy physics at or close to the tev scale , where non - relativistic dynamics plays an important if not defining role . </S>",
    "<S> we first discuss in detail the third - order corrections to top - quark pair production in electron - positron collisions in the threshold region , which plays a major role at a future high - energy @xmath0 collider . </S>",
    "<S> threshold effects are also relevant in the production of heavy particles in hadronic collisions , where in addition to the coulomb force soft gluon radiation contributes to enhanced quantum corrections . </S>",
    "<S> we review the joint resummation of non - relativistic and soft gluon effects for pair production of top quarks and supersymmetric particles to next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> the third topic deals with pair annihilation of dark matter particles within the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model . here </S>",
    "<S> the electroweak yukawa force generated by the exchange of gauge and higgs bosons can cause large `` sommerfeld '' enhancements of the annihilation cross section in some parameter regions .    </S>",
