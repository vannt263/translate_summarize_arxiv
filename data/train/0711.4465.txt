    "consider the problem of estimating the astrophysical parameters ( aps ) of a star from its spectrum using a grid of pre - labelled spectra .",
    "let @xmath0 , @xmath1 be the data vector ( spectrum or multiband photometry ) and @xmath2 , @xmath3 be the ap vector ( e.g.  , , etc . ) .",
    "standard approaches involve performing a global regression on the grid to infer the mapping @xmath4 , using , for example , a artificial neural network ( ann ) ( e.g.  bailer - jones et al .",
    "1998 ) or a support vector machine ( svm ) ( e.g.  tsalmantza et al .  2006 ) .",
    "although these methods meet with reasonable success , they have problems when it comes to estimating multiple aps , in particular if some aps have a relatively weak signature ( as is the case with  and [ fe / h ] : compare the vertical scales in fig .  [ formod ] ) . to overcome this we should weight the variables according to their sensitivity with respect to the aps of interest . in principle ,",
    "anns and svms implicitly learn this weighting from the data , but this is difficult with many noisy variables .",
    "furthermore , a global regression approach is strictly flawed , because while the photon counts in a band varies uniquely with the aps , the converse is not true ( fig .",
    "[ formod ] ) .",
    "the global regression is trying to solve an inverse problem and the lack of uniqueness could lead to a poor fit .",
    "this degeneracy problem is exacerbated at low spectral resolution and by noise .",
    "the new algorithm addresses these issues by explicit use of the sensitivities , @xmath5 , of each band @xmath6 to each ap @xmath7 .",
    "these are estimated by fitting a ( smooth ) function , @xmath8 to each band , which i refer to as the _ forward model _",
    "[ formod ] ) .",
    "sensitivities are estimated from these via first differences .",
    "these are used to improve the commonly - employed nearest neighbour ( or @xmath9 minimization ) technique .",
    "we locally interpolate the grid , defining `` optimal '' directions for interpolation using the sensitivities , and predicting the photon counts at off - grid points using the forward model .",
    "task : estimate aps of measured vector @xmath10 . the core algorithm ( for @xmath11 )",
    "is as follows , where subscripts refer here to iterations ( see fig .",
    "[ principle ] )    1 .",
    "fit the forward model to the grid , @xmath12 2 .",
    "initialize : find nearest grid neighbour to @xmath10 .",
    "call this @xmath13 3 .   use the forward model to calculate the local sensitivities , @xmath14 4 .",
    "calculate the discrepancy ( residual ) , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 for the first iteration ) 5 .",
    "make a step in ap space , @xmath17 .",
    "this is the new ap prediction 6 .",
    "use the forward model to predict the corresponding ( off - grid ) flux , @xmath18 7 .",
    "iterate steps 36    for the general case of @xmath19 , step 5 is simply an average over the update calculate for each band , i.e.  @xmath20 . for multiple aps ( @xmath21 )",
    ", we can write this in matrix format as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 $ ] is the @xmath24 matrix of reciprocal sensitivities , i.e.   @xmath25 ( mathematical rigour being sacrificed to some degree ) .",
    "the actual algorithm is a bit more complex ( e.g.  modified step size ) .",
    "i apply the algorithm to a set of synthetic optical photometry of stars showing variation in  and .",
    "the @xmath26 photometric bands are part of a system originally designed for gaia ( jordi et al .",
    "the data show a large variation in aps ( fig .",
    "[ residuals ] ) , and the grid is quite sparse , comprising just 233 objects .",
    "the test set contains 234 objects , with no ap combinations in common between the grid and test set .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of the test set has been reduced to 10 per band .",
    "the algorithm applied is actually a simpler version of the general case described above : the forward model in steps 3 and 6 is a local linear interpolation ( i.e.  a plane ) of the neighbours in ap space ( not data space ! ) to the current point under consideration .",
    "thus the forward models are robust but suboptimal ( as we are no longer taking advantage of the reasonable assumption that @xmath27 is smooth ) .",
    "the progress of the algorithm in terms of the ap estimates is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ iterations ] for two of the 234 test cases .",
    "these have been selected to demonstrate both good and poor convergence for the two aps .",
    "the residuals of the estimates over all 234 objects are shown in fig .",
    "[ residuals ] , plotted against the true aps .",
    "the rms errors are 1.65dex in  and 0.042dex in  ( corresponding to 480k at 5000k ) .",
    "these compare to 0.99dex for  and 0.028dex for   ( 320k at 5000k ) for an svm model trained and tested on the same data .",
    "the systematic error in  is also seen with the svm and is characteristic of the weak ap problem ( but not , i believe , unassailable ) .",
    "the algorithm currently performs slightly worse than one of the best generic regression algorithms available ( an svm ) , yet this is not bad considering that ( a ) it is in an early stage of development , and ( b ) the results were obtained using a ( suboptimal ) _ linear _ forward model . unlike anns , the dimensionality of the algorithm s fitting depends on the number of aps ( @xmath28 ) , not the number of data dimensions ( @xmath29 ) , so it should scale well to typical spectral problems ( @xmath28 is a few , @xmath29 is a few thousand ) .",
    "moreover , the method has the ability to detect and report multiple solutions which arise from degeneracies in the data ( see fig .",
