    "the critical jamming transition of soft frictionless spheres at zero temperature provides a framework for understanding the mechanical and low - temperature response of a wide range of disordered materials  @xcite .",
    "however , in order to connect the jamming scenario to systems that include , for example , temperature , attractive interactions , or friction , it is important to understand how these effects perturb the physics of the jammed solid .",
    "for example , spheres with frictional interactions are able to jam at lower densities than those without friction when subjected to an external shear stress , leading to a so - called anisotropic  shear - jammed \" state  @xcite .",
    "several studies have studied shear jamming in frictionless particle packings  @xcite and have shown that finite systems can shear jam  @xcite . here ,",
    "we focus primarily on mechanical properties of the shear - jammed state of athermal , frictionless , soft repulsive spheres , and report three main findings . first ,",
    "although the density range over which frictionless shear jamming occurs vanishes in the thermodynamic limit , as previously observed  @xcite , frictionless shear jamming is _ not _ a finite - size effect . in isotropic jamming",
    ", the lack of long - range correlations in the bond forces associated with particle - particle contacts means that the average residual shear stress , @xmath0 , is zero by symmetry and fluctuations scale as @xmath1 relative to the pressure , @xmath2 .",
    "however , because the shear - jammed state has long - ranged bond force correlations , it can support a non - zero residual shear stress as well as pressure in the thermodynamic limit , unlike the isotropically - jammed state , which supports only pressure .",
    "second , the shear - jamming transition is different from the isotropic jamming transition . in isotropic jamming ,",
    "the property that shear stress fluctuations vanish in the thermodynamic limit gives rise to different scaling of the bulk modulus , @xmath3 , and shear modulus , @xmath4  @xcite ; the vanishing of @xmath5 as the transition is approached from above is one of the defining characteristics of jamming .",
    "in shear jamming , the fact that the shear stress does not vanish in the thermodynamic limit changes the scaling of the shear modulus so that @xmath5 remains constant at the shear - jammed transition .",
    "our third main finding is that despite these striking differences , the shear and isotropic jamming transitions share an important symmetry . the effect of shear on the scaling behaviors discussed above is a result of an induced rotation of the six - dimensional eigenvectors of the stiffness tensor  @xcite .",
    "once this rotation is taken into account , the @xmath6 symmetry of isotropic jamming is preserved in the rotated subspace . therefore , despite having different scaling exponents for the shear modulus , shear jamming and isotropic jamming should be considered members of the same universality class .",
    "we study 3@xmath7 athermal disordered packings of @xmath8 to @xmath9 frictionless spheres in cubic boxes with periodic boundary conditions . particles",

    ", we study 50:50 bidisperse packings with 1:1.4 diameter ratio .",
    "to create our packings , we conduct @xmath23 1000 to 10000 independent runs for each value of @xmath24 and @xmath25 studied .",
    "each run begins with a completely random ( infinite - temperature ) configuration .",

    "each curve ends at low @xmath24 or high @xmath40 due to statistics ; the more configurations we study , the higher each curve extends in @xmath40 .",

    "if @xmath40 were to vanish with increasing @xmath25 , the shear - jammed states would become indistinguishable from isotropically - jammed states in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the fact that @xmath40 does not need to be scaled by @xmath25 in order to collapse the data suggests that shear - jammed states with distinct properties from isotropically - jammed states still exist in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we now consider systems strained past the point of shear - jamming into the jammed state . specifically , we generate systems at logarithmically spaced values of shear stress @xmath47 . to obtain these configurations ,",
    "we start with a system that has been sheared beyond the onset of shear jamming as described above .",
    "we then pick a target shear stress , @xmath48 at the upper end of the range of shear stresses we want to study , and adjust the strain until the target shear stress is obtained to within @xmath49 . to approach @xmath48 efficiently",
    "we exploit the definition of the elastic constants , @xmath50 . to linear order the needed strain is @xmath51 .",

    "the scaling variable for the stress is @xmath69 . ]    similarly , the scaling behavior of the elastic constants reflects the anisotropy of the shear - jammed state . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "isotropically - jammed systems are characterized by just two elastic constants , the bulk modulus @xmath3 ( which jumps discontinuously at jamming , scaling as @xmath70 where @xmath71 ) and the shear modulus @xmath4 ( which increases continuously , scaling as @xmath72 with @xmath73 ) . for shear - jammed systems ,",

    "integrals over these correlation functions contribute to components of the stress tensor .",
    "if a bond correlation function approaches a constant value at large separations , then the corresponding component of the stress tensor remain constant as @xmath99 ; if it is short - ranged , the corresponding component of the stress tensor vanishes as @xmath54 . in the appendix , we show that these bond correlation functions can be written in a way that respects the broken symmetry of shear - jammed systems .",
    "in such systems , there is still no long - ranged order in the @xmath100 orientation , but long - ranged order does exist in the @xmath29 orientation , giving rise to the results shown in figure  [ fig : g ] .",
    "a remarkable symmetry emerges at the shear jamming transition .",
    "we first note an important symmetry at the isotropic jamming transition . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the bulk modulus jumps to a non - zero value while the shear modulus remains zero , so @xmath101 . by spatial isotropy , the various shear moduli  @xcite in finite systems near jamming all scale the same way ;",
    "the @xmath6 rotational symmetry of isotropic jamming induces a symmetry in the various elastic moduli , all of which vanish linearly with @xmath57 as @xmath102 and @xmath103 .    a convenient way to see",
    "this symmetry is by viewing the elastic constant tensor @xmath104 as a linear transformation from the six - dimensional space of strain tensors to the six - dimensional space of stress tensors ( explicitly implemented , for example , in mandel notation . )",
    "the resulting @xmath105 mandel stiffness matrix has 6 eigenvalues ; at the isotropic jamming transition , one of these is nonzero while the remaining 5 vanish in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the eigenvector of the mandel matrix corresponding to the nonzero eigenvalue corresponds to the bulk modulus , while the 5 eigenvectors corresponding to the vanishing eigenvalues are related to the shear moduli .",

    "figure  ( [ fig : cik ] ) indicates that this same scenario appears to arise during shear jamming , despite the fact that shear breaks rotation invariance .",
    "measuring the eigenvalues of the mandel matrix transformation as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we find that the constant values of both @xmath3 and @xmath74 as the shear jamming transition is approached from above ( @xmath118 ) both reflect the behavior of a _ single _ eigenvalue of this transformation .",
    "thus @xmath119 for some symmetric tensor @xmath108 given by the corresponding eigenvector ; the components of @xmath108 are described in the inset of fig .",
    "( [ fig : cik ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the other five eigenvalues vanish at the shear - jamming transition with the same exponent that governs the shear moduli in isotropic jamming",
    ". these results are consistent with earlier findings by peyneau and roux  @xcite , who found that one eigenvalue was much larger than the others in stressed systems close to the jamming transition . in other words ,",
    "both isotropic jamming and shear jamming select a distinguished direction @xmath108 in the six - dimensional space of elastic moduli . in the case of isotropic jamming , this direction projects entirely onto the bulk modulus , but for shear jamming it projects onto both @xmath3 and @xmath74 . in both cases ,",
    "we observe an emergent @xmath6 symmetry in the remaining five dimensions .",
    "note from the inset to figure  [ fig : cik ] that by far the dominant contribution to @xmath108 comes from the bulk modulus , with only a small contribution from @xmath74 .",
    "this behavior is reflected in the values of @xmath3 and @xmath74 at the transition ; while clearly nonzero , the magnitude of @xmath74 is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the value of @xmath3 .",
    "the small value of @xmath74 and its small contribution to @xmath108 may be a result of the fact that the packing is frictionless .",
    "frictional packings may have much larger values of @xmath74 relative to @xmath3 and much higher anisotropies in their structure .",
    "our results imply that the distinguishing hallmark of the jamming transition , whether isotropic or shear - induced , is to break symmetry in six - dimensional stress space below the jamming transition by picking out one distinguished direction at the jamming transition , leaving @xmath6 symmetry in the remaining five directions .",
    "this suggests that the scaling theory for shear jamming will be the same as for regular jamming ,  rotated \" in this six - dimensional space , and that the distinguished role of pressure in scaling near isotropic jamming will be replaced in shear - jamming by that of the stress along the tensor direction @xmath108 .",
    "in summary , we find that shear - jammed states are different from isotropically - jammed states .",
    "this is due to the anisotropy induced by shear , even for frictionless sphere packings in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "shearing induces long - ranged bond correlations ; as a result , the shear stress , @xmath47 , is proportional to the pressure with a prefactor that does not depend on @xmath25 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this leads to modified scaling exponents for @xmath47 and the elastic constant @xmath74 , so that @xmath74 , like the bulk modulus , jumps discontinuously at the onset of shear jamming .    however , the differences between shear - jammed and isotropically - jammed states , although striking , are more superficial than fundamental . the discontinuous behavior of @xmath74 in shear",
    "jamming is due to a rotation of the dominant eigenvector @xmath108 of the stiffness matrix .",
    "this rotation seems to preserve an emergent @xmath6 symmetry in the 5-dimensional subspace orthogonal to @xmath108 .",
    "an interesting question is whether this symmetry emerges for any combination of stresses leading to jamming @xcite .",
    "note that there are other potential ways of creating shear - jammed states .",
    "one could start with an isotropically - jammed state , apply a shear stress and then decrease the pressure @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one could start with unjammed states at lower density and apply simultaneous shear and compression until the system jams . with our protocol of starting with isotropically unjammed systems near the onset of jamming , and then straining the system until it shear jams",
    ", it becomes more difficult to create shear - jammed states with increasing system size because one must start with isotropically unjammed states that are closer to the onset of jamming .",
    "however , the strain that must be applied to shear - jam the system does not increase with system size .",
    "these results suggest that the difficulty of preparing shear - jammed states is an artifact of our protocol .",
    "if one starts with unjammed states and compresses and shears the system simultaneously towards the onset of jamming , or if one approaches the jamming transition from the jammed side , it should be possible to consistently create shear - jammed states even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it remains to be seen whether states prepared in these different ways still obey the emergent @xmath6 symmetry that we observe .",
    "there is no doubt , however , that shear - jammed configurations in frictionless packings are well - defined in the thermodynamic limit , since a combination of shear and compression on an infinitely large system will undoubtedly produce a jammed state with long - ranged bond - force correlations .",
    "the scalings of @xmath2 , @xmath47 , @xmath53 , @xmath3 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 can be understood microscopically in terms of the behavior of spatial bond correlations .",

    "the authors owe a great intellectual debt to leo kadanoff .",
    "his demonstration of how scaling arguments can be used to understand and categorize the universality of physical phenomena was an inspiration for many of the ideas in this paper .",
    "his catholic taste in choosing problems , his success in developing simple models to understand complex phenomena , and his complete lack of snobbishness in deciding what problems were important allowed theory and experiment to work together to make progress throughout many areas of science .",

    "<S> we study the shear jamming of athermal frictionless soft spheres , and find that in the thermodynamic limit , a shear - jammed state exists with different elastic properties from the isotropically - jammed state . </S>",
    "<S> for example , shear - jammed states can have a non - zero residual shear stress in the thermodynamic limit that arises from long - range stress - stress correlations . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the shear and bulk moduli , which in isotropically - jammed systems vanishes as the jamming transition is approached from above , instead approaches a constant . despite these striking differences </S>",
    "<S> , we argue that in a deeper sense , the shear jamming and isotropic jamming transitions actually have the same symmetry , and that the differences can be fully understood by rotating the six - dimensional basis of the elastic modulus tensor .    </S>",
