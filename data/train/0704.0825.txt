    "the parent compounds of cuprate superconductors are the mott insulators with an antiferromagnetic ( af ) long - range order ( aflro ) , then via the charge carrier doping , one can drive these materials through a metal - insulating transition and enter the superconducting ( sc ) dome @xcite .",
    "it has become clear in the past twenty years that cuprate superconductors are among the most complex systems studied in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "the complications arise mainly from ( 1 ) a layered crystal structure with one or more cuo@xmath1 planes per unit cell separated by insulating layers which leads to a quasi - two - dimensional electronic structure , and ( 2 ) extreme sensitivity of the physical properties to the compositions ( stoichiometry ) which control the carrier density in the cuo@xmath1 plane @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "both experimental investigation and theoretical understanding are extremely difficult .    by virtue of systematic studies using the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) , the low - energy electronic structure of cuprate superconductors in the sc state is well - established by now @xcite , where an agreement has emerged that the electronic quasiparticle - like excitations are well defined , and are the entities participating in the sc pairing . in particular , the lowest energy states are located at the @xmath0 $ ] point of the brillouin zone , where the d - wave sc gap function is maximal , then the most contributions of the electron spectral function come from the @xmath0 $ ] point @xcite .",
    "moreover , some arpes experimental results unambiguously established the bogoliubov - quasiparticle nature of the sharp sc quasiparticle peak near the @xmath0 $ ] point @xcite , then the sc coherence of the quasiparticle peak is described by the simple bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) formalism @xcite .",
    "however , there are numerous anomalies for different families of cuprate superconductors , which complicate the physical properties of the electronic structure @xcite . among these anomalies",
    "is the dramatic change in the spectral lineshape around the @xmath0 $ ] point first observed on the bilayer cuprate superconductor bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 , where a sharp quasiparticle peak develops at the lowest binding energy , followed by a dip and a hump , giving rise to the so - called peak - dip - hump ( pdh ) structure in the electron spectrum @xcite .",
    "later , this pdh structure was also found in yba@xmath1cu@xmath3o@xmath4 @xcite and in bi@xmath1sr@xmath1ca@xmath1cu@xmath3o@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , although the sharp quasiparticle peaks are identified in the sc state along the entire fermi surface , the pdh structure is most strongly developed around the @xmath0 $ ] point @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the pdh structure in bilayer cuprate superconductors in the sc state is the mostly remarkable effect , however , its full understanding is still a challenging issue .",
    "the earlier works @xcite gave the main impetus for a phenomenological description of the single - particle excitations in terms of an interaction between quasiparticles and collective modes , which is of fundamental relevance to the nature of superconductivity and the pairing mechanism in cuprate superconductors . however , the different interpretive scenario has been proposed @xcite .",
    "this followed from the observation of the bilayer splitting ( bs ) for both normal and sc states in a wide doping range @xcite .",
    "this bs of the cuo@xmath1 plane derives the electronic structure in the bonding and antibonding bands due to the present of cuo@xmath1 bilayer blocks in the unit cell of bilayer cuprate superconductors , then the main features of the pdh structure is caused by the bs @xcite , with the peak and hump corresponding to the antibonding and bonding bands , respectively .",
    "furthermore , some arpes experimental data measured above and below the sc transition temperature show that this pdh structure is totally unrelated to superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the recent arpes experimental results reported by several groups support this scenario , and most convincingly suggested that the pdh structure originates from the bs at any doping levels @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this pdh structure in bilayer cuprate superconductors has not been treated starting from a microscopic sc theory .    within the single layer @xmath6-@xmath7-@xmath8 model ,",
    "the electronic structure of the single layer cuprate superconductors in the sc state has been discussed @xcite based on the framework of the kinetic energy driven superconductivity @xcite , and the main features of the arpes experiments on the single layer cuprate superconductors have been reproduced , including the doping and temperature dependence of the electron spectrum and quasiparticle dispersion . in this paper , we study the electronic structure of bilayer cuprate superconductors in the sc state along with this line . within the kinetic energy",
    "driven sc mechanism @xcite , we employed the @xmath6-@xmath7-@xmath8 model by considering the bilayer interaction , and then show explicitly that the bs occurs due to this bilayer interaction . in this case , the electron spectrum is split into the bonding and antibonding components by this bs , then the sc peak is closely related to the antibonding component , while the hump is mainly formed by the bonding component .",
    "in other words , the well pronounced pdh structure in the electron spectrum of bilayer cuprate superconductors is mainly caused by the bs .",
    "furthermore , the spectral weight in the @xmath0 $ ] point increases with increasing the doping concentration . in analogy to the normal - state case @xcite , both electron antibonding peak and bonding hump have the weak dispersions around the @xmath0 $ ] point , in qualitative agreement with the experimental observation on bilayer cuprate superconductors in the sc state @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the basic formalism is presented in sec .",
    "ii , where we generalize the kinetic energy driven superconductivity from the previous single layer case @xcite to the bilayer case , and then evaluate explicitly the longitudinal and transverse components of the electron normal and anomalous green s functions ( hence the bonding and antibonding electron spectral functions ) . within this theoretical framework",
    ", we discuss the electronic structure of bilayer cuprate superconductors in the sc state in sec .",
    "it is shown that the striking pdh structure in bilayer cuprate superconductors is closely related to the bs .",
    "finally , we give a summary and discussions in sec .",
    "it has been shown from the arpes experiments @xcite that the two - dimensional @xmath6-@xmath7-@xmath8 model is of particular relevance to the low energy features of cuprate superconductors . for discussions of the physical properties of bilayer cuprate superconductors ,",
    "the @xmath6-@xmath7-@xmath8 model can be expressed by including the bilayer interactions as , @xmath9 supplemented by an important on - site local constraint @xmath10 to avoid the double occupancy , where @xmath11 representing the nearest neighbors of a given site @xmath12 , @xmath13 representing the next nearest neighbors of a given site @xmath12 , @xmath14 is plane index , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is the electron creation ( annihilation ) operator , @xmath17 is the spin operator with the pauli matrices @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the chemical potential , and the interlayer coherent hopping has the form , @xmath20 which is strongly anisotropic and follows the theoretical predictions @xcite . in particular",
    ", this momentum dependent form ( 2 ) has been experimentally verified @xcite . for this @xmath6-@xmath7-@xmath8 model ( 1 ) , it has been argued that crucial requirement is to impose the electron single occupancy local constraint for a proper understanding of the physical properties of cuprate superconductors . to incorporate the electron single occupancy local constraint ,",
    "the charge - spin separation ( css ) fermion - spin theory has been proposed @xcite , where the constrained electron operators are decoupled as , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with the spinful fermion operator @xmath23 represents the charge degree of freedom together with some effects of the spin configuration rearrangements due to the presence of the doped hole itself ( dressed holon ) , while the spin operator @xmath24 represents the spin degree of freedom , then the bilayer @xmath6-@xmath7-@xmath8 hamiltonian ( 1 ) can be expressed in this css fermion - spin representation as , @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the doping concentration .",
    "it has been shown that the electron single occupancy local constraint is satisfied in analytical calculations within this css fermion - spin theory , and the double spinful fermion occupancy are ruled out automatically @xcite .",
    "although in common sense @xmath29 is not a real spinful fermion , it behaves like a spinful fermion @xcite . as in the single layer case @xcite , the kinetic energy terms in the bilayer @xmath6-@xmath7-@xmath8 model",
    "have been transferred as the dressed holon - spin interactions , which can induce the dressed holon pairing state ( hence the electron cooper pairing state ) by exchanging spin excitations in the higher power of the doping concentration . before calculation of the electron normal and anomalous green s functions of the bilayer system in the sc state",
    ", we firstly introduce the sc order parameter . as we have mentioned above , there are two coupled cuo@xmath1 planes in the unit cell , and in this case , the sc order parameters for the electron cooper pair is a matrix @xmath30 , with the longitudinal and transverse sc order parameters in the css fermion - spin theory can be expressed as ,    @xmath31    respectively , where the spin correlation functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and the longitudinal and transverse dressed holon pairing order parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    within the @xmath6-@xmath8 type model , robust indications of superconductivity with the d - wave symmetry in doped cuprates have been found by using numerical techniques @xcite . on the other hand , it has been argued that the sc transition in doped cuprates is determined by the need to reduce the frustrated kinetic energy @xcite . although it is not necessary for the strong coupling of the electron quasiparticles and a pairing boson in their arguments @xcite ,",
    "a series of the inelastic neutron scattering experimental results provide a clear link between the electron quasiparticles and magnetic excitations @xcite .",
    "in particular , an impurity - substitution effect on the low energy dynamics has been studied by virtue of the arpes measurement @xcite , this impurity - substitution effect is a magnetic analogue of the isotope effect used for the conventional superconductors .",
    "these experimental results @xcite reveal that the impurity - induced changes in the electron self - energy show a good correspondence to those of the magnetic excitations , indicating the importance of the magnetic fluctuation to the electron pairing in cuprate superconductors .",
    "recently , we @xcite have developed the kinetic energy driven sc mechanism based on the css fermion - spin theory @xcite , where the dressed holons interact occurring directly through the kinetic energy by exchanging spin excitations , leading to a net attractive force between dressed holons , then the electron cooper pairs originating from the dressed holon pairing state are due to the charge - spin recombination , and their condensation reveals the sc ground - state . within this sc mechanism @xcite ,",
    "the doping and temperature dependence of the electron spectral function of the single layer cuprate superconductors in the sc state has been discussed @xcite . in this section ,",
    "our main goal is to generalize these analytical calculations from the single layer case to the bilayer system . as in the case for the sc order parameter , the full dressed holon normal and anomalous green s functions",
    "can also be expressed as @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",

    "this result shows that although there is a single electron interlayer coherent hopping ( 2 ) in bilayer cuprate superconductors in the sc state , the electron interlayer pairing interaction vanishes .",
    "this reflects that in the present kinetic energy driven sc mechanism , the weak dressed holon - spin interaction due to the interlayer coherent hopping ( 2 ) from the kinetic energy terms in eq .",
    "( 3 ) does not induce the dressed holon interlayer pairing state by exchanging spin excitations in the higher power of the doping concentration .",
    "this is different from the dressed holon - spin interaction due to the intralayer hopping from the kinetic energy terms in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , it can induce superconductivity by exchanging spin excitations in the higher power of the doping concentration @xcite .",
    "our this result is also consistent with the arpes experimental results of the bilayer cuprate superconductor bi(pb)@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite , where the sc gap separately for the bonding and antibonding bands has been measured , and it is found that both d - wave sc gaps from the antibonding and bonding components are identical within the experimental uncertainties .    to our present understanding , two main reasons why the electronic structure of bilayer cuprate superconductors in the sc state can be described qualitatively in the framework of the kinetic energy driven superconductivity by considering the bilayer interaction are as follows .",
    "firstly , the bilayer interaction causes the bs , this leads to that the full electron normal ( anomalous ) green s function is divided into the longitudinal and transverse parts , respectively , then the bonding and antibonding electron spectral functions ( sc gap functions ) are obtained from these longitudinal and transverse parts of the electron normal ( anomalous ) green s function , respectively . although the transverse part of the sc gap parameter @xmath125 , the antibonding peak around the @xmath0 $ ] point is always at lower binding energy than the bonding peak ( hump ) due to the bs . in this sense ,",
    "the pdh structure in the bilayer cuprate superconductors in the sc state is mainly caused by the bs .",
    "secondly , the sc state in the kinetic energy driven sc mechanism is the conventional bcs like as in the single layer case @xcite .",
    "this can be understood from the electron normal and anomalous green s functions in eq .",
    "( 9 ) . since the spins center around the @xmath127 $ ] point in the mf level @xcite , then the main contributions for the spins comes from the @xmath127 $ ] point . in this case , the longitudinal and transverse parts of the electron normal and anomalous green s functions in eq .",
    "( 9 ) can be approximately reduced in terms of @xmath128}\\sim 0 $ ] and one of the self - consistent equations @xcite",
    "@xmath129 $ ] as ,    @xmath130    where the electron coherent weights @xmath131 , the electron quasiparticle coherence factors @xmath132 and @xmath133 , the sc gap function @xmath134 and the electron quasiparticle spectrum @xmath135 , with @xmath136 $ ] .",
    "as in the single layer case @xcite , this reflects that the hole - like dressed holon quasiparticle coherence factors @xmath137 and @xmath138 and hole - like dressed holon quasiparticle spectrum @xmath139 have been transferred into the electron quasiparticle coherence factors @xmath140 and @xmath141 and electron quasiparticle spectrum @xmath142 , respectively , by the convolutions of the corresponding longitudinal and transverse parts of the mf spin green s function and full dressed holon normal and anomalous green s functions due to the charge - spin recombination @xcite . as a result , these electron normal and anomalous green s functions in eq .",
    "( 12 ) are typical bilayer bcs like @xcite .",
    "this also reflects that as in the single layer case @xcite , the dressed holon pairs condense with the d - wave symmetry in a wide range of the doping concentration , then the electron cooper pairs originating from the dressed holon pairing state are due to the charge - spin recombination , and their condensation automatically gives the electron quasiparticle character .",
    "these are why the basic bilayer bcs formalism @xcite is still valid in discussions of sc coherence of the quasiparticle peak and hump , although the pairing mechanism is driven by the intralayer kinetic energy by exchanging spin excitations , and other exotic magnetic scattering @xcite is beyond the bcs formalism .",
    "we have studied the electronic structure of bilayer cuprate superconductors in the sc state based on the kinetic energy driven sc mechanism @xcite .",
    "our results show that the electron spectrum of bilayer cuprate superconductors is split into the bonding and antibonding components by the bs , then the observed pdh structure around the @xmath0 $ ] point is mainly caused by this bs , with the sc peak being related to the antibonding component , and the hump being formed by the bonding component . the spectral weight increases with increasing the doping concentration . in analogy to the two flat bands appeared in the normal state ,",
    "the antibonding and bonding quasiparticles around the @xmath0 $ ] point disperse weakly with momentum , in qualitative agreement with the experimental observation on the bilayer cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "our these results also show that the bilayer interaction has significant contributions to the electronic structure of bilayer cuprate superconductors in the sc state .",
    "it has been shown from the arpes experiments @xcite that the bs has been detected in both normal and sc states , and then the electron spectral functions display the double - peak structure in the normal state and pdh structure in the sc state .",
    "recently , we @xcite have studied the electron spectrum of bilayer cuprate superconductors in the normal state , and shown that the double - peak structure in the electron spectrum in the normal state is dominated by the bs . on the other hand , although the antibonding and bonding sc peaks have different dispersions , the antibonding and bonding parts have the same d - wave sc gap amplitude as mentioned above . incorporating our previous discussions for the normal state case @xcite and the present studies for the sc state case , we therefore find that the one of the important roles of the interlayer coherent hopping ( 2 ) is to split the electron spectrum of the bilayer system into the bonding and antibonding components in both normal and sc states . as a consequence , the well pronounced pdh structure of bilayer cuprate superconductors in the sc state and double - peak structure in the normal state",
