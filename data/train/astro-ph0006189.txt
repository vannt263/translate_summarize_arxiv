    "an instrument description of the _ orfeusii _ echelle spectrometer as well as its performance and the data reduction are given by barnstedt et al .",

    "the high latitude galactic halo star hd93521 was one of the pi targets chosen to be observed for possible h@xmath10 absorption .",

    "these authors could not detect other components at higher velocities presumably because the sensitivity of the _ copernicus _ spectrometer was too low for such a weak component .    on the other hand it was well known from high resolution ground based measurements that the interstellar -line shows a complex profile toward hd93521 : mnch & zirin ( @xcite ) found two main components ( out of four altogether ) at velocities of @xmath312kms@xmath4 and @xmath356.3kms@xmath4 indicating at least one intermediate velocity cloud ( _ ivc _ ) .",
    "later on rickard ( @xcite ) reported a good correlation between the cak - lines in front of hd93521 to the profile of the hydrogen 21 cm lines .",

    "this paper presents the detection of molecular hydrogen in absorption in the galactic disk as well as in an _ ivc _ in the galactic halo . following the arguments and findings by mnch & zirin ( @xcite ) , rickard ( @xcite ) , albert ( @xcite ) and danly et al .",
    "( @xcite ) we designate absorption features occuring at radial velocities near @xmath312kms@xmath4 as produced by gas components belonging to the galactic disk and the absorption features near @xmath362kms@xmath4 as gas belonging to the galactic halo .",

    "with the _ orfeusii _ echelle spectrometer it was possible for the first time to observe h@xmath10 absorption components at higher velocities toward hd93521 . a comparison for some h@xmath10 absorption features in the rotational level @xmath13=1 with ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and a typical line is shown on a radial velocity scale in fig .",
    "these unsmoothed data show convincingly the presence of a higher velocity component shifted by about @xmath350kms@xmath4 against the galactic disk component discussed above .",
    "altogether for six @xmath13=1 features the corresponding equivalent widths were determined using a multi - gaussian fit with linear continuum .",

    "the equivalent widths of table  [ tab2 ] have been fitted to a curve of growth as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] with a @xmath15-value of @xmath25kms@xmath4 .",
    "the resulting logarithmic column density is @xmath16=1@xmath17=14.32 with an uncertainty of @xmath180.25dex , the latter arising in large part from the errors made in determining the equivalent widths .    in the rotational level @xmath13=2",
    "just one line exhibits an absorption feature near @xmath362kms@xmath4 above our detection limit .",
    "the equivalent width @xmath14@xmath1116m of this w2r2 line ( 965.793 , @xmath19=0,0323 ) leads to a value of @xmath20=2@xmath17@xmath213.88 applying the curve of growth shown in fig .",

    "we calculate an excitation temperature @xmath21@xmath2800k",
    ". this value must be regarded as an upper limit .",
    "the fact that comparable absorption features for the @xmath13=0 rotational level in the lyman - bands have not been observed implies a lower limit for the corresponding excitation temperature .",
    "assuming again a boltzman distribution for the population densities of these rotational levels an excitation temperature of 300k leads to a logarithmic column density @xmath16=0@xmath17@xmath213.6 and therewith to equivalent widths below 10m , and thus below the detection limit of the _ orfeus _ echelle spectrometer",
    ". the stronger r0 components of the werner bands could not be used for this evaluation because they are superimposed by the corresponding r1 components . in the w1 - 0 band",
    "the wavelength difference of both components is 19m , corresponding to about 0.6 electronic pixel . within the above excitation temperature range we estimate the total logarithmic column density of molecular hydrogen to be @xmath22h@xmath6=14.6@xmath180.35 for the _ ivc _ located in the galactic halo toward hd93521 .",
    "the _ orfeus fuv _ spectrum of hd93521 shows absorption by interstellar h@xmath10 at two radial velocity components around @xmath312 kms@xmath4 and @xmath362kms@xmath4 .",
    "the hydrogen fraction in its molecular form is 0.0025 for the galactic disk gas and about 190 times smaller for the galactic halo component .",
    "these calculations are based on the column densities reported by spitzer & fitzpatrick ( @xcite ) . attributing their velocity components 1 - 4 ( @xmath366.3 to @xmath338.8kms@xmath4 ) as gas belonging to the galactic halo we get @xmath23@xmath24=19.69 and @xmath23@xmath25=19.88 from the other 6 velocity components .",
    "the estimated range for the excitation temperature indicates that uv pumping also takes place in the gas of the _ ivc _ in the galactic halo .",
    "orfeus could only be realized with the support of all our german and american colleagues .",
    "the orfeus program was supported by dara grants we3os8501 and we2qv9304 and nasa grant nag5 - 696 .",
