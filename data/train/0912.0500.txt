    "it has been the major goal of particle physics to discover a theoretical framework for unifying gravity with the other three known forces , _ viz .",
    "_ , electromagnetism , and the weak and strong nuclear forces . such a theory must be compatible with quantum theory at very small scales corrsponding to very high energies .",
    "even the possibly less ambitious goal of reconciling general relativity with quantum theory has been elusive and may require new concepts to accomplish .",
    "there has been a particular interest in the possibility that a quantum gravity theories will lead to lorentz invariance violation ( liv ) at the planck scale , @xmath1 m. this scale corresponds to a mass ( energy ) scale of @xmath2 gev / c@xmath3 .",
    "it is at the planck scale where quantum effects are expected to play a key role in determining the effective nature of space - time that emerges as general relativity in the classical continuum limit .",
    "the idea that lorentz invariance ( li ) may indeed be only approximate has been explored within the context of a wide variety of suggested planck - scale physics scenarios .",
    "these include the concepts of deformed relativity , loop quantum gravity , non - commutative geometry , spin foam models , and some string theory ( m theory ) models .",
    "such theoretical explorations and their possible consequences , such as observable modifications in the energy - momentum dispersion relations for free particles and photons , have been discussed under the general heading of `` planck scale phenomenology '' .",
    "there is an extensive literature on this subject .",

    "one should keep in mind that in a context that is separate from quantum gravity considerations , it is important to test li for its own sake  @xcite .",
    "_ liv gratia liv_. the significance of such an approach is evident when one considers the unexpected discoveries of the violation of @xmath4 and @xmath5 symmetries .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that a violation of @xmath6 would imply liv  @xcite    we will consider here some of the consequent searches for such effects using high energy astrophysics observations , particularly observations of high energy cosmic @xmath0-rays and ultrahigh energy cosmic rays .",
    "we know that lorentz invariance has been well validated in particle physics ; indeed , it plays an essential role in designing machines such as the new lhc ( large hadron collider ) .",
    "thus , any liv extant at accelerator energies ( `` low energies '' ) must be extremely small .",
    "this consideration is reflected by adding small lorentz - violating terms in the free particle lagrangian .",
    "such terms can be postulated to be independent of quantum gravity theory , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "alternatively , it can be assumed that the terms are small because they are suppressed by one or more powers of @xmath7 ( with the usual convention that @xmath8 . ) in the latter case , in the context of effective field theory ( eft ) , such terms are assumed to approximate the effects of quantum gravity at `` low energies '' when @xmath9 .    one result of such assumptions is a modification of the dispersion relation that relates the energy and momentum of a free particle or photon .",
    "this , in turn , can lead to a maximmum attainable velocity ( mav ) of a particle different from @xmath10 or a variation of the velocity of a photon _ in vacuo _ with photon energy .",
    "both effects are clear violations of relativity theory",
    ". such modifications of kinematics can result in changes in threshold energies for particle interactions , suppression of particle interactions and decays , or allowance of particle interactions and decays that are kinematically forbidden by lorentz invariance  @xcite .",
    "a simple formulation for breaking li by a small first order perturbation in the electromagnetic lagrangian which leads to a renormalizable treatment has been given by coleman and glashow  @xcite .",
    "the small perturbative noninvariant terms are both rotationally and translationally invariant in a preferred reference frame which one can assume to be the frame in which the cosmic background radiation is isotropic .",
    "these terms are also taken to be invariant under @xmath11 gauge transformations in the standard model .",
    "using the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite , we denote the mav of a particle of type @xmath12 by @xmath13 , a quantity which is not necessarily equal to @xmath14 , the low energy _ in vacua _ velocity of light .",
    "we further define the difference @xmath15 .",
    "these definitions can be generalized and can be used to discuss the physics implications of cosmic - ray and cosmic @xmath0-ray observations  @xcite .",
    "in general then , @xmath16 .",
    "the physical consequences of such a violation of li depend on the sign of the difference between these two mavs . defining    @xmath17",
    "one can consider the two cases of positive and negative values of @xmath18 separately  @xcite .",
    "_ case i : _ if @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , the decay of a photon into an electron - positron pair is kinematically allowed for photons with energies exceeding    @xmath21    the decay would take place rapidly , so that photons with energies exceeding @xmath22 could not be observed either in the laboratory or as cosmic rays . from the fact that photons have been observed with energies @xmath23 50  tev from the crab nebula , one deduces for this case that @xmath24tev , or that -@xmath25 .    _ case ii : _ for this possibility , where @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , electrons become superluminal if their energies exceed @xmath28 .",
    "electrons traveling faster than light will emit light at all frequencies by a process of ` vacuum erenkov radiation . '",

    "note that this limit is two orders of magnitude weaker than the limit obtained for case i. however , this limit can be considerably improved by considering constraints obtained from studying the  spectra of active galaxies  @xcite .",
    "a constraint on @xmath18 for @xmath33 follows from a change in the threshold energy for the pair production process @xmath34 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the square of the four - momentum is changed to give the threshold condition    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the energy of the low energy photon and @xmath37 is the angle between the two photons . the second term on the left - hand - side comes from the fact that @xmath38 .",
    "it follows that the condition for a significant increase in the energy threshold for pair production is @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 , or equivalently , @xmath42 .",
    "the observed @xmath0-ray spectrum of the active galaxies mkn 501 and mkn 421 while flaring  @xcite exhibited the high energy absorption expected from @xmath0-ray annihilation by extragalactic pair - production interactions with extragalactic infrared photons  @xcite .",
    "this led stecker and glashow  @xcite to point out that the mkn 501 spectrum presents evidence for pair - production with no indication of liv up to a photon energy of @xmath3020  tev and to thereby place a quantitative constraint on liv given by @xmath43 .",
    "as previously mentioned , liv has been proposed to be a consequence of quantum gravity physics at the planck scale  @xcite . in models involving large extra dimensions ,",
    "the energy scale at which gravity becomes strong can occur at a quantum gravity scale , @xmath44 , even approaching a tev  @xcite . in the most commonly considered case , the usual relativistic dispersion relations between energy and momentum of the photon and the electron are modified  @xcite by a term of order @xmath45 .    generalizing the liv parameter @xmath18 from equation ( [ delta ] ) to an energy dependent form , we find    @xmath46    it follows that the threshold condition for pair production given by equation ( [ threshold ] ) implies that @xmath47 since pair production occurs for energies of at least 20 tev , we find a constraint on the quantum gravity scale  @xcite @xmath48 .",
    "this constraint contradicts the predictions of some proposed quantum gravity models involving large extra dimensions and smaller effective planck masses . in a variant model of ref .",
    "@xcite , the photon dispersion relation is changed , but not that of the electrons . in this case",
    ", we find the even stronger constraint @xmath49 .",
    "one possible manifestation of lorentz invariance violation , from planck scale physics produced by quantum gravity effects , is a change in the energy - momentum dispersion relation of a free particle or a photon . if this results from the linear planck - supressed term as in equation  ( [ pcube ] ) above , this results in a photon velocity retardation that is of first order in @xmath50  @xcite . in a @xmath51 cosmology , where present observational data indicate that @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the resulting difference in the propagation times of two photons having an energy difference @xmath54 from a @xmath0-ray burst ( grb ) at a redshift @xmath55 will be    @xmath56    for a photon dispersion of the form @xmath57 ) , with @xmath10 being the usual low energy velocity of light  @xcite . in other words , @xmath18 , as defined earlier , is given by @xmath58 .",
    "the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope , ( see figure [ glast ] ) , with its  _ burst monitors ( gbm ) _ covers an energy range from 8 kev to 40 mev and its _ large area telescope ( lat ) _ covers an energy range from 20 mev to @xmath59 gev",
    ". it can observe and study both grbs and flares from active galactic nuclei over a large range of both energy and distance .",
    "this was the case with the grb 090510 , a short burst at a cosmological distance corresponding to a redshift of 0.9 that produced photons with energies extending from the x - ray range to a  of energy @xmath60 31 gev .",
    "this burst was therefore a perfect subject for the application of equation ( [ delay ] ) .",
    "_ fermi _ observations of grb090510 have yielded the best constraint on any first order retardation of photon velocity with energy @xmath61 .",
    "this result would require a value of @xmath62  @xcite in large extra dimension scenarios , one can have effective planck masses smaller than @xmath63 gev , whereas in most qg scenarios , one expects that the minimum size of space - time quanta to be @xmath64 .",
    "this implies a value for @xmath65 in all cases .    in particular ,",
    "we note the string theory inspired model of ref .",
    "this model invisions space - time as a gas of d - particles in a higher dimensional bulk where the observable universe is a d3 brane .",
    "the photon is represented as an open string that interacts with the d - particles , resulting a retardation @xmath66 .",
    "the new _ fermi _ data appear to rule out this model as well as other models that predict such a retardation .",
    "the dispersion effect will be smaller if the dispersion relation has a quadratic dependence on @xmath50 as suggested by effective field theory considerations  @xcite .",
    "this will obviate the limits on @xmath67 given above .",
    "these considerations also lead to the prediction of vacuum birefringence ( see next section ) .",
    "a possible model for quantizing space - time which has been actively investigated is _ loop quantum gravity _ ( see the review given in ref .  @xcite and references therein . )",
    "a signature of this model is that the quantum nature of space - time can produce a vacuum birefringence effect .",
    "( see also the eft treatment in ref .",
    "this is because electromagnetic waves of opposite circular polarizations will propagate with different velocities , which leads to a rotation of linear polarization direction through the angle @xmath68t/2=\\xi                k^2 t/2m_{pl } \\label{rotation}\\ ] ] for a plane wave with wave - vector @xmath69  @xcite .",
    "again , for simple planck - suppressed liv , we would expect that @xmath70 .",
    "some astrophysical sources emit highly polarized radiation .",
    "it can be seen from equation ( [ rotation ] ) that the rotation angle is reduced by the large value of the planck mass . however , the small rotations given by equation ( [ rotation ] ) can add up over astronomical or cosmological distances to erase the polarization of the source emission . therefore ,",
    "if polarization is seen in a distant source , it puts constraints on the parameter @xmath71 .",
    "observations of polarized radiation from distant sources can therefore be used to place an upper bound on @xmath71 .",
    "equation ( [ rotation ] ) indicates that the higher the wave number @xmath72 , the stronger the rotation effect will be .",
    "thus , the depolarizing effect of space - time induced birefringence will be most pronounced in the  energy range .",
    "it can also be seen that the this effect grows linearly with propoagation time .",
    "the difference in rotation angles for wave - vectors @xmath73 and @xmath74 is    @xmath75    replacing the time @xmath76 by the distance from the source to the detector , denoted by @xmath77 .",
    "the best secure bound on this effect , @xmath78 , was obtained using the observed 10% polarized soft  emission from the region of the crab nebula  @xcite .",
    "clearly , the best tests of birefringence would be to measure the polarization of  from grbs .",
    "we note that linear polarization in x - ray flares from grbs has been predicted  @xcite .",
    "most bursts have redshifts in the range 1 - 2 corresponding to distances of greater than a gpc .",
    "should polarzation be detected from a burst at distance @xmath77 , this would place a limit on @xmath79 of    @xmath80    where @xmath81 is the distance to the burst in units of 0.5 gpc  @xcite .",
    "detectors that are dedicated to polarization measurements in the x - ray and  energy range and which can be flown in space to study the polarization from distant astronomical sources are now being designed  @xcite .",
    "shortly after the discovery of the 3k cosmogenic background radiation ( cbr ) , greisen  @xcite and zatsepin and kuzmin  @xcite predicted that pion - producing interactions of such cosmic ray protons with the cbr should produce a spectral cutoff at @xmath82 50 eev .",
    "the flux of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) is expected to be attenuated by such photomeson producing interactions .",
    "this effect is generally known as the `` gzk effect '' .",
    "owing to this effect , protons with energies above @xmath60100  eev should be attenuated from distances beyond @xmath83 mpc because they interact with the cbr photons with a resonant photoproduction of pions  @xcite .",
    "let us consider the photomeson production process leading to the gzk effect .",
    "near threshold , where single pion production dominates ,    @xmath84    using the normal lorentz invariant kinematics , the energy threshold for photomeson interactions of uhecr protons of initial laboratory energy @xmath85 with low energy photons of the cbr with laboratory energy @xmath86 , is determined by the relativistic invariance of the square of the total four - momentum of the proton - photon system .",
    "this relation , together with the threshold inelasticity relation @xmath87 for single pion production , yields the threshold conditions for head on collisions in the laboratory frame    @xmath88    for the proton , and    @xmath89    in terms of the pion energy , where m is the rest mass of the proton and m is the rest mass of the pion  @xcite .    if li is broken so that @xmath90 , the threshold energy for photomeson is altered .. this process would be allowed by liv in the case where @xmath91 is negative , producing a sharp cutoff in the uhecr proton spectrum .",
    "( for more details , see refs .",
    "@xcite . ]    because of the small liv perturbation term , the square of the four - momentum is shifted from its li form so that the threshold condition in terms of the pion energy becomes    @xmath92    where @xmath93 , again in units where the low energy velocity of light is unity .",
    "equation ( [ livpi ] ) is a quadratic equation with real roots only under the condition    @xmath94    defining @xmath95 ev with @xmath96 k , equation ( [ root ] ) can be rewritten    @xmath97      if liv occurs and @xmath98 , photomeson production can only take place for interactions of cbr photons with energies large enough to satisfy equation ( [ cg ] ) .",
    "this condition , together with equation ( [ livpi ] ) , implies that while photomeson interactions leading to gzk suppression can occur for `` lower energy '' uhe protons interacting with higher energy cbr photons on the wien tail of the spectrum , other interactions involving higher energy protons and photons with smaller values of @xmath86 will be forbidden .",
    "thus , the observed uhecr spectrum may exhibit the characteristics of gzk suppression near the normal gzk threshold , but the uhecr spectrum can `` recover '' at higher energies owing to the possibility that photomeson interactions at higher proton energies may be forbidden .",
    "we now consider a more detailed quantitative treatment of this possibility , _ viz .",

    "the kinematical relations governing photomeson interactions are changed in the presence of even a small violation of lorentz invariance .",
