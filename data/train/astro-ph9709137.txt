    "we present the analysis of the distribution of ly-@xmath0 clouds at @xmath2 .",
    "our line sample was drawn from the hst fos spectra of 152 qsos . in order to achieve self - consistency",
    "we reduced all the spectra from scratch .",
    "the line sample consists of lines between the ly-@xmath3 and ly-@xmath0 emission lines .",
    "we excluded : metal systems and regions adjacent to them , lines within 3000  km / s from the qso emission redshift , and lines with @xmath4   .",
    "the resulting sample has 595 lines .",
    "the evolution of the ly-@xmath0 forest lines is usually described with @xmath5 . for a non - evolving population of clouds @xmath6 , depending on @xmath7 . at @xmath8 , @xmath9 is significantly higher than 1 , indicating strong evolution ( e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the results from the hst key project showed that for low redshifts @xmath9 is smaller , and in principle consistent with no evolution ( @xcite , @xcite ; see @xcite for completed key project results ) .",
    "we estimated @xmath9 for various subsets of our sample .",
    "see @xcite for detailed description of the sample and the analysis .",
    "we present the major results in tab .  1 and on fig .  1 .",
    "we confirm that line density evolution at @xmath10 is much slower than at higher redshifts and that it is consistent with the no evolution case .",
    "it is possible that the number density of weak lines increases with decreasing redshift . in any case",
    ", there is a significant difference in the evolution of weak and strong lines . while number densities of strong and weak lines are comparable at @xmath11 , the former outnumber the latter more than twice at @xmath12 .",
    "this can be an indication that the weak and strong lines are members of separate populations of the absorbers .",
