    "the sensitivity of tunneling to the influence of the environment has been in the focus of intense research over the last years @xcite .",
    "a popular model for the investigation of tunneling processes is a double - well potential with an energy barrier that separates two energetically degenerate minima . in an idealized system",
    ", the barrier can be coherently traversed by a quantum mechanical particle ( _ coherent tunneling _ ) . a real physical system , however , experiences the influence of the surrounding `` outer world '' .",
    "this coupling disturbs the coherent tunneling process and it constitutes the origin of decoherence and dissipation in the quantum system . to model the dissipative influence , the environment is commonly described as an ensemble of harmonic oscillators ( _ heat bath , reservoir _ ) being at thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath1 . a bilinear coupling between the quantum system and the bath mimics phenomenologically the interaction of the system with the `` rest of the world '' .",
    "by this method , the quantum mechanical analogue of the generalized langevin equation can be derived .",
    "the spectrum of the uncoupled symmetric bistable potential consists of a ladder of doublets being pairs of energetically nearly degenerate energy eigenstates .",
    "the degeneracy is lifted by the tunneling splittings within the single doublets .",
    "the doublets themselves are separated by large interdoublet energy gaps which are of the order of the related characteristic system frequency scale , the latter are generally orders of magnitude larger than the tunneling splittings .    by now , two different situations have been in the center of detailed investigations on the dissipative tunneling dynamics in a bistable potential : ( i ) on the one hand , one considers the regime of low temperatures , i.e. , @xmath2 is of the order of the energy splitting of the lowest tunneling doublet . a common approach to simplify the _ spatially continuous _ dynamics",
    "consists then in restricting the problem to the two lowest energy eigenstates , being the solely significantly thermally populated in this deep quantum regime .",
    "coupling the two - level system to a bosonic bath of harmonic oscillators leads to the prominent _ spin - boson problem _ @xcite .",
    "( ii ) on the other hand , the starting point is classical rate theory . _",
    "semi - classical _ tunneling corrections to the relaxation rate are calculated by use of various instanton techniques @xcite .",
    "this formalism is applicable when the quantized energy levels lie very dense below the barrier , i.e. , in cases when the energy barrier is large compared to the characteristic level splitting of the quantum system .",
    "moreover , a _ local equilibrium _ is required , restricting this approach only to time-_in_dependent systems . by complex - time path",
    "integral techniques , the free energy is calculated in a semiclassical steepest - descent method .",
    "this leads to the dissipative bounce solution which in turn determines the semiclassical decay rate .",
    "modern experimental developments have paved the way to study the influence of time - dependent external driving forces like a laser beam or an rf - field .",
    "such time - dependent driving fields have most interesting implications for quantum systems like , for instance , the effect of _ coherent destruction of tunneling _",
    "@xcite , the effect of quantum stochastic resonance @xcite , or the occurrence of quantum steps in hysteresis loops @xcite , to name but a few ( for recent reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "such driving fields may also be used to control and reduce decoherence in open quantum systems @xcite .    the present work deals with tunneling processes in a time - dependent bistable potential in a temperature regime where the two - level approximation ( _ spin - boson regime _ ) is invalid .",
    "likewise , the ( possibly ) strong time - dependent external fields prevents the use of _ semiclassical _ methods .",
    "our analysis therefore bridges those two well established limiting regimes in quantum rate theory .    with this objective in mind , we release the restriction of the bistable potential to its two lowest energy eigenstates and extend the model to include more energy eigenstates which are populated at higher temperatures .",
    "this implies an interesting consequence : since the energy splittings of the higher doublets are larger , tunneling becomes more favorable via the higher doublets .",
    "however , for the temperature being too large , tunneling is again hampered due to the decoherent influence of the environment .",
    "this interplay among tunneling , vibrational relaxation ( i.e. , transitions _ between _ the doublets ) and thermal effects leads to a rich and complex dynamics .",
    "the specific problem we tackle is the following : let us consider a quantum particle which is initially localized in one of the two wells of a double - well potential .",
    "what is then the _ rate _ with which the probability of finding the particle in this well decays in presence of an ohmic - like environment ?",
    "in addition , what are the asymptotic well populations ?",
    "an additional manipulation of the potential barrier , i.e. , a static bias or a time - dependent harmonic driving may be applied . in this work",
    ", we provide an analytic method to solve this non - trivial problem - also in presence of a time - dependent driving field - in a very general manner .",
    "we restrict ourselves neither to a large semi - classical potential barrier , nor to a weak system - bath interaction nor to weak driving fields .",
    "our analysis is based on the real - time path integral technique which uses the feynman - vernon formulation as a starting basis . by treating the",
    "bath induced correlations between quantum paths within a generalized non - interacting cluster approximation , a generalized master equation for the diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix is derived .",
    "it turns out that the approximation is appropriate in the regime of moderate temperature and/or moderate system - bath coupling .",
    "a further simplification of the integro - differential equation leads to a markovian approximated master equation whose rate coefficients are obtained in the form of closed analytical expressions . by comparing the results of the full generalized master equation versus the markovian approximated master equation and versus the numerical quasiadiabatic propagator path integral algorithm @xcite , we conclude that the analytical approximation permits correct predictions for the decay process out of the initially populated potential well .",
    "the rate governing the long - time dynamics of the decay is obtained as the _ smallest eigenvalue _ of the matrix of the ( time averaged ) rate coefficients .",
    "the dependence of this quantum relaxation rate and of the asymptotic population of the metastable well on the various physical parameters is investigated in detail .",
    "we stress that the developed method is _ not _ restricted to this specific problem but can be applied to many different other physical situations where a potential with a discrete energy spectrum can be assumed .",
    "a short summary of this present work has been published in ref .",
    "before we proceed , we motivate that the stated problem is not of formal academic nature but , in contrast , has several applications to real physical systems . for that purpose ,",
    "we have collected numerous experimental works in the following subsection [ subsec.exp ] . in the subsequent subsection [ subsec.theo ] we briefly review the few existing theoretical works and discuss some of their shortcomings and inconsistencies which we attempt to overcome by our techniques .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec.model ] our specific model is introduced .",
    "the succeeding section [ sec.realtimepathint ] is devoted to the derivation of the dissipative real - time path integral which is cast in the discrete variable representation ( dvr ) , i.e. , the eigenbasis of that system operator which couples to the reservoir .",
    "the example of the double - doublet system illustrates this transformation in section [ subsec.dds ] . in section [ sec.gnica ]",
    "we introduce an approximation to the so far exact real - time path integral expressions .",
    "this approximative treatment of the bath induced path correlations allows for the derivation of a generalized master equation ( gme ) .",
    "this is shown in section [ sec.gme ] , where also the lowest order expressions for the integral kernels of the gme are given . in section [ sec.rate ]",
    "we extract the leading rate for the decay out of one of the two potential wells .",
    "this is possible if one applies an additional markovian approximation to the gme .",
    "a detailed study of the dependence of the quantum relaxation rate on the various model parameter is put forward in section [ sec.results ] . moreover ,",
    "an investigation of the asymptotic well population is presented .",
    "finally , our conclusions together with an outlook are presented in section [ sec.conclusio ] .",
    "several experiments where dissipative multilevel systems are involved have been performed in many different physical systems .",
    "we report on four timely examples to motivate the importance and the need for a consistent and general theory for the above stated problem .",
    "the first set of experiments deals with quantum tunneling of magnetization in nanomagnets @xcite . a macroscopic sample of molecular magnets consists of a large number ( typically @xmath3 ) of chemically identical magnetic clusters of the same magnetic size .",
    "they are regularly arranged on a crystal lattice .",
    "the single molecules have usually a large spin quantum number , typically @xmath4 . experiments ( see below ) indicate a strong uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy .",
    "it favors a doubly - degenerate spin alignment along the c - axis of the crystal , @xmath5 , and generates an energy barrier for the reversal of magnetization .",
    "this implies two - fold degenerate excited states corresponding to the spin - projections @xmath6 in a double - well potential @xcite . at sufficiently low temperatures",
    ", the spins can tunnel through the anisotropy barrier .",
    "two such materials are currently studied in detail : the first is referred to as @xmath7-acetate .",
    "it possesses a tunneling barrier of @xmath8 ( @xmath9 denotes the boltzmann constant ) .",
    "resonant tunneling of magnetization reveals itself as quantum steps in hysteresis loops which go along with maxima in the relaxation rate for specific values of an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the second candidate is known as @xmath10 and has the advantage that the anisotropy barrier is approximately three times smaller than in @xmath7 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this property enhances the observed effect by several orders of magnitude as compared to the case with @xmath7 . for",
    "the @xmath10 samples several experiments on quantum tunneling of magnetization have been reported as well @xcite .",
    "especially interesting for us are the measurements by wernsdorfer _",
    "_ @xcite ; those are performed at non - adiabatic driving fields and at temperatures where many doublets contribute to the dynamics .",
    "a second class of experiments addresses tunneling of the magnetic flux in superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the total flux threaded through the squid ( or the phase difference across a current biased josephson junction ) obeys a collective motion of a macroscopic number of quasiparticles .",
    "the classical equation of motion for the flux dynamics maps to that of a particle moving dissipatively in a ( symmetric ) double - well potential .",
    "its lowest left ( right ) well corresponds to one of the two fluxoid states 0 ( 1 ) of the squid .",
    "for sufficiently low temperature , the transition between these states occurs via tunneling through the potential barrier .",
    "measurements of the relaxation of a fluxoid state initially prepared in an rf - squid have addressed two different physical situations : the results in ref .",
    "@xcite have been interpreted as _",
    "incoherent tunneling _ in a _ macroscopic two - state system _ and those in ref .",
    "@xcite have been explained as _ resonant tunneling _ between two quasi - degenerate localized states in different fluxoid wells .",
    "the rate of tunneling out of the metastable well _ vs. _ the applied external flux exhibits a series of local maxima .",
    "these occur at those values of the external flux where the adiabatic energy levels of the biased squid potential form avoided level crossings . by applying a resonant time - dependent external rf - field , han _ et al . _",
    "@xcite created a population inversion between the two adjacent fluxoid wells .",
    "furthermore , silvestrini _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported the observation of energy level quantization in underdamped josephson junctions _ above _ the crossover temperature which separates the classical from the quantum regime .",

    "in the latest work of this group , friedman _ et al . _",
    "@xcite report on the realization of a quantum superposition of macroscopic states in an rf - squid .",
    "similar observations were recently made by the group of mooij @xcite where symmetric and antisymmetric quantum superpositions of macroscopic states of a dc - squid have been created .",
    "another set of experiments concerns the tunneling dynamics of substitutional defects in solids @xcite .",
    "for instance , in a crystalline environment tunneling arises from defect ions which do not fit properly in the sites offered by the host lattice .",
    "the symmetry of the host crystal determines a complicated potential energy landscape with several degenerate minima for the defect ion .",
    "@xcite studied the relaxation rates of individual microscopic defects in a mesoscopic disordered bi - metal . since the sample dimensions were comparable to the phase - breaking length for quantum transport @xcite at low temperatures , the sample s conductance was highly sensitive to the positions of the scattering centers .",
    "their observations were found to be consistent with predictions of the dissipative two - level system @xcite at low temperatures .",
    "however , measurements at higher temperatures @xcite have indicated the failure of the two - level theory @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the study of thermally assisted tunneling of atomic hydrogen and deuterium in boron - doped crystalline silicon reveals @xcite that the relaxation rate calculated by a path integral centroid formalism differs from experimental measurements by two orders of magnitude . finally , enss and hunklinger @xcite have pointed out several discrepancies between predictions of a semiclassical tunneling model , where the two wells are approximated by harmonic oscillators ( _ harmonic - well approximation _ , see also appendix [ app.harmwell ] ) , and experimental measurements at low temperatures .",
    "they proposed an improved approach by taking into account elastic interactions among the tunneling systems to resolve these discrepancies .    the last class of experiments concerns systems in chemical physics with the goal of controlling of chemical reactions @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen pair transfer in the hydrogen - bonded cyclic dimers of numerous carboxylic acids is used as a prototype system to study the relation between quantum tunneling and chemical kinetics .",
    "the measurements show that the free hydrogen - bonded dimers possess two energetically degenerate equilibrium configurations .",
    "they correspond to the two minima of a double - well potential .",
    "both quantum tunneling and vibrational excitation are important for the transfer of the hydrogen pair .",
    "this has been studied experimentally in detail in refs .",
    "a specific control scheme ( `` hydrogen - subway '' ) has been proposed @xcite to steer intramolecular hydrogen transfer reactions in malonaldehyde by ultrashort laser pulses .",
    "the conventionally proposed method for the transfer consists in applying a laser pulse that lifts an initially localized wavepacket in the reactant region _ over _ the barrier thus allowing propagation towards the final product configuration .",
    "the new approach in ref .",
    "@xcite is to drive the wave packet not over but _ through _ the barrier .",
    "this is achieved by exciting higher lying doublets where tunneling occurs on a much shorter time - scale than in the lower doublets .",
    "the advantage of this new proposal is that it requires laser intensities which are considerably smaller than those used in the conventional approach .",
    "previous theoretical works dealing with dissipative spatially continuous quantum systems , being driven or undriven , naturally fall into two classes : approaches that are more of a numerical or analytical flavor , respectively .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the harmonically driven double - well potential has been investigated numerically in presence of dissipation . for that purpose ,",
    "a master equation for the reduced density matrix has been derived on the basis of the standard born - markov assumption @xcite .",
    "subsequently , an analytical floquet approach is used to derive the master equation . in doing so",
    ", an improved master equation has been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", the floquet theory is applied on the level of the schrdinger equation and the born - markov approximation is made for the quasienergy spectrum . in both cases ,",
    "the system - bath coupling is treated perturbatively .",
    "this restricts the method to the _ weak - coupling regime_. the same regime of a weak system - bath coupling was treated by naundorf _",
    "also , standard redfield ( i.e. , weak - coupling ) techniques have been applied to derive a master equation .",
    "the specific shape of a laser pulse is determined in order to control hydrogen tunneling in a dissipative environment @xcite . in the strong coupling regime ,",
    "the harmonically driven double - well potential has been studied in the context of quantum hysteresis and quantum stochastic resonance @xcite . in this work , the system has been iterated numerically using the tensor multiplication scheme within the quasiadiabatic propagator path integral technique developed by makri and makarov @xcite .",
    "more analytical oriented works in the context of dissipative multilevel bistable systems have been performed by several groups @xcite . the starting point in refs .",
    "@xcite is a multilevel system with interdoublet transition terms ( vibrational relaxation ) which are _ not _ strictly derived from a _ continuous _ double - well potential ; these are constructed phenomenologically .",
    "this leads to the assumption that the vibrational coupling occurs only between vibrational states located inside the same well .",
    "the group of silbey @xcite considered a _",
    "static _ multilevel system .",
    "additionally , only tunneling states differing by one quantum of vibrational excitation are assumed to be connected .",
    "finally , it is assumed that the vibrational coupling within each well is the same for both wells .",
    "this _ a priori _ excludes the case with a static asymmetry of the potential .",
    "the group of morillo and cukier @xcite started out from a similar hamiltonian like in @xcite .",
    "they restricted the model further and included only the _ two doublets _ with the lowest energy , i.e. , the so - called _",
    "double - doublet system_. the authors for the first time included a time - dependent driving which couples to a phenomenologically constructed dipole operator of the multilevel system .",
    "the system - bath interaction is treated perturbatively within a generalized redfield approach . in a sequence of articles @xcite",
    ", dekker analyzed the real - time dynamics of a quantum particle in the dissipative static double - well potential _ ab initio _ by means of a multisite spin - hopping model .",
    "he derives the reduced quantum liouville equation for the particle , thereby not restricting the dynamics to the lowest doublet only .",
    "the interdoublet vibrational dynamics is approximated by coarse - graining the density matrix elements on a time scale of many vibrational periods .",
    "it is further assumed that the localized states in the wells are approximated by the eigenfunctions of a harmonic oscillator ( _ harmonic - well approximation _ ) .",
    "this latter assumption can be justified as long as the barrier height is large compared to the interdoublet energy gap . in this parameter regime , however , the application of the standard semiclassical rate theory @xcite is appropriate , and even simpler to apply . in the deep quantum regime with low to intermediate barrier heights ,",
    "this assumption increasingly becomes invalid and leads to considerable deviations of the approximated wave functions from the exact ones ( cf .",
    "also appendix [ app.harmwell ] ) .",
    "also , the eigenenergies of the harmonic potential are considerably different from the exact ones for a shallow energy barrier .    a related",
    "problem has been investigated in a series of theoretical works by ovchinnikov and co - workers @xcite by applying _",
    "semiclassical _ techniques . in ref .",
    "@xcite larkin and ovchinnikov developed a method to calculate the decay rate of metastable voltage states of josephson junctions .",
    "they constructed a kinetic equation for the probabilities of population of many energy levels .",
    "the transition probabilities are determined for a cubic potential in semiclassical approximation for _ weak _ system - bath coupling .",
    "this procedure assumes a decay into the continuum via quantum tunneling or thermal hopping .",
    "however , within confining potentials such as a double - well this assumption may be not justified .",
    "the effect of time - dependent driving is included within an approximation . the low temperature case where tunneling prevails is considered in ref .",
    "@xcite for vortices moving in a washboard potential being weakly coupled to the environment . also quasiclassical conditions have been assumed .",
    "the problem of divergent expressions for the decay rate at avoided level crossings is cured in ref .",
    "@xcite where a _ two - level approximation _ at the avoided level crossings is invoked .",
    "the authors treat the problem within the harmonic well ( i.e. , quasiclassical ) approximation for a constant spectral density of the bath modes , and for a weak system - bath coupling .",
    "the semiclassical expressions of ref .",
    "@xcite are applied to josephson junctions ( i ) in ref .",

    "@xcite to study the influence of temperature for resonant macroscopic quantum tunneling .",
    "finally , the theory is adapted to squids in ref .",
    "@xcite to explain the experimental findings of ref .",
    "however , the theoretical results follow qualitatively those obtained from the standard wkb - approximation .",
    "the calculated decay rate differs from the experimental results by two - to - four orders of magnitude for small static potential asymmetries , i.e. , with still large barriers , where the semiclassical treatment should yield rather good agreement .",
    "in contrast , for large bias asymmetries , one of the two barrier heights becomes rather small so that the semiclassical approximation is expected to yield worse results .",
    "the agreement with the experimental data turned out to be of the same order of magnitude .",
    "this inconsistency may be mainly traced back to the fact that the semiclassical treatment is not appropriate for a system in the deep quantum regime when only two to six levels lie below the energy barrier .    in summary ,",
    "_ no _ analytic treatment exists in the prior literature where tunneling and vibrational relaxation is investigated consistently in the regime where a finite number of discrete energy eigenstates rules the dissipative dynamics .",
    "this is so even for the situation that no time - dependent driving acts upon the system .",
    "while standard redfield theory for a weak system - bath coupling is used frequently , the theory for the strong coupling regime for static as well as for driven multilevel systems is still in its infancy .",
    "the main objective of this work is to fill this gap in deriving analytical schemes that cover the physics in this prominent regime of a moderate - to - strong system - bath coupling .",
    "we consider a quantum particle with mass @xmath12 , position operator @xmath13 and momentum operator @xmath14 moving in a one - dimensional double - well potential @xmath15 which may include a static asymmetry .",

    "the spectrum consists of a ladder of pairs of energy eigenstates ( _ doublets _ ) .",
    "the energy gaps within each doublet generally are several orders of magnitude smaller than the inter - doublet energy gaps and are responsible for the _ tunneling dynamics _ between the two wells .",

    "<S> a study of the dynamics of a tunneling particle in a driven bistable potential which is moderately - to - strongly coupled to a bath is presented . upon restricting the system dynamics to the hilbert space spanned by the @xmath0 lowest energy eigenstates of the bare static potential , a set of coupled non - markovian master equations for the diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix , within the _ discrete variale representation _ , is derived . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting dynamics is in good agreement with predictions of _ ab - initio _ real - time path integral simulations . </S>",
    "<S> numerous results , analytical as well as numerical , for the _ quantum relaxation rate _ and for the _ asymptotic populations _ are presented . </S>",
    "<S> our method is particularly convenient to investigate the case of shallow , time - dependent potential barriers and moderate - to - strong damping , where both a semi - classical and a redfield - type approach are inappropriate . </S>",
