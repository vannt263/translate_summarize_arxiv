    "early studies of the advection and diffusion of a large - scale magnetic field threading a turbulent disc indicated that a _ weak _ large - scale field would diffuse outward rapidly ( van ballegooijen 1989 ; lubow , papaloizou , & pringle 1994 ; lovelace , romanova , & newman 1994 ; lovelace , newman , & romanova 1997 ) .",
    "this rapid outward diffusion may however be offset by the highly conducting surface layers of the disc where the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) and associated turbulence is suppressed ( bisnovatyi - kogan & lovelace 2007 ; rothstein & lovelace 2008 ) .",
    "the magnetic field is `` frozen - in '' in the conducting surface layers which tend to flow inward at approximately the disc accretion speed .",
    "this conclusion is supported by an analytic model for the vertical profiles of the velocity and field components of a stationary accretion disc developed by lovelace , rothstein , and bisnovatyi - kogan ( 2009 ) .",
    "this model predicts that the inward or outward transport of the poloidal magnetic flux is determined by both the plasma @xmath6 ( the ratio of the midplane plasma pressure to the midplane magnetic pressure ) and the efficiency of the magnetic disc wind in removing angular momentum from the disc ( bisnovatyi - kogan & lovelace 2012 ) . guilet and ogilvie ( 2012 , 2013 ) independently developed an analytic model for the vertical structure of a turbulent / diffusive disc threaded by a large scale magnetic field , and they find a reduction in the rapid outward field diffusion .",
    "accretion discs around black holes are considered in many cases to be threaded by a large - scale magnetic field ( lovelace 1976 ) .",
    "this field may be transported inward from the interstellar medium by the accreting disc plasma ( as investigated here ) , or it may arise from dynamo activity in the disc ( e.g. , pariev , colgate , & finn 2007 ) .",
    "of course the discs around magnetized stars may be threaded at large distances by the disconnected stellar magnetic field ( lovelace , romanova , & bisnovatyi - kogan 1995 ) .",
    "the large - scale field may be in the form of magnetic loops threading the disc and extending into a low density plasma corona as sketched in figure 1 .",
    "differential rotation of the disc acts to open the magnetic loops which have footpoints at different radii ( newman , newman , & lovelace 1992 ) . also , the differential rotation acts to give an axisymmetric field .",
    "such large scale magnetic fields can have an essential role in forming jets and winds .",
    "in previous axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of a disc threaded by magnetic loops , the disc was treated as a conducting boundary condition with plasma outflow and keplerian azimuthal velocity ( romanova et al .",
    "these simulations showed that the innermost loop inflates and opens significantly faster than the outer loops due to the larger differential rotation of the disc close to the star .",
    "the opened magnetic fields carry away energy , angular momentum , and mass from the disc .",
    "one or more neutral layers form between the regions of oppositely directed magnetic field lines leading to field reconnection and annihilation .",
    "the aim of the present work is to understand the dynamics of the magnetic field loops _ and _ the dynamics of the disc in response to the twisting of the loops .",
    "the magnetic field mediates an outflow of energy , angular momentum and matter from the disc to a jet and wind . at the same time",
    "the disc accretion rate can be strongly enhanced by the angular momentum outflow to the jet or wind .",
    "we treat the disc as a viscous / diffusive plasma taking into account fully the back reactions of the coronal field on the disc .",
    "the turbulent viscosity @xmath7 of the disc is modelled with an @xmath8 coefficient using the shakura and sunyaev ( 1973 ) prescription .",
    "the turbulent magnetic diffusivity @xmath9 is modeled with a second @xmath10 coefficient as proposed by bisnovatyi - kogan and ruzmaikin ( 1976 ) . the viscosity and diffusivity",
    "are assumed to arise from turbulence triggered by the magneto - rotational instability inside the disc ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) , but this turbulence is not modeled in the present simulations . the low density coronal plasma outside the disc is treated using ideal mhd .",
    "we carry out axisymmetric simulations using a godunov - type scheme to solve the mhd equations , including viscosity and magnetic diffusivity inside the disc as described by ustyugova et al .",
    "our initial magnetic field configuration consists of three loops in the simulation region .",
    "new unmagnetized matter is supplied to the disc at the outer boundary .",
    "for this configuration the innermost loop opens up rapidly and forms a collimated magnetically dominated jet near the @xmath11axis and an uncollimated matter dominated wind at larger distances from the axis .",
    "the second loop opens at a later time due to the smaller shear in the disc and it produces a matter dominated wind .",
    "the outermost loop reconnects before there is time for it to open .",
    "the loop configuration allows us to evaluate _ both _ the accretion speed of the magnetic field and accretion speed of the disc matter .",
    "this allows a comparison with the analytic model of field accretion of lovelace et al .",

    "spherical @xmath31 coordinates .",
    "however , for some purposes cylindrical coordinates are advantageous , and they are denoted @xmath32 .    both the viscosity and the magnetic diffusivity of the disc plasma are thought to be due to turbulent fluctuations of the velocity and magnetic field . outside of the disc , the plasma is considered ideal with negligible viscosity and diffusivity .",

    "the momentum flux density tensor is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the viscous stress contribution from the turbulent fluctuations of the velocity and magnetic field .",
    "as mentioned we assume that these can be represented in the same way as the collisional viscosity by substitution of the turbulent viscosity .",
    "moreover , we assume that the viscous stress is determined mainly by the gradient of the angular velocity because the azimuthal velocity is the dominant velocity of the disc .",
    "the leading order contribution to the momentum flux density from turbulence is therefore    @xmath43    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the plasma angular velocity .",

    "in addition to the boundary conditions , which are required for the well - posedness of our problem , we impose additional conditions on variables to eliminate numerical artifacts in the simulations .",
    "for instance , we require that the radial velocity at the surface of the star be negative .",
    "thus there there is no outflow of matter , angular momentum , or energy from the star .",
    "we also require that along the external boundary the radial velocity be inwards inside the disc and outwards outside the disc so the disc matter will tend to accrete and matter in the corona will tend to be ejected .",

    "the simulations clearly show the inward advection of the magnetic field at about the same speed as the matter advection before the field decays by annihilation .    at early times ( @xmath240 ) , we find that the innermost field loop twists and its field lines become open",
    ". for the different field loops we estimate two important time scales : one is the time scale for each loop to open due to differential rotation of its foot points , and the other is the field annihilation time scale owing to the disc s magnetic diffusivity .",
    "the innermost field loop opens rapidly before there is significant annihilation . on the other hand",
    "the outer loop decays significantly before there is time for it to open .",
    "the twisting of the opened field lines of the inner loop leads to the formation of _ both _ an inner collimated magnetically dominated jet and at larger distances from the axis a matter dominated uncollimated wind . for later times ( @xmath1 )",

    "we show that the derived @xmath2 agrees approximately with the predictions of a model where the accretion speed is the sum of a contribution due the disc s viscosity ( which gives a radial outflow of angular momentum in the disc ) and a term due to the twisted magnetic field at the disc s surface ( which gives a vertical outflow of angular momentum ) ( lovelace et al . 2009 ; 1994 ) . at later times",
    "the magnetic contribution to @xmath2 becomes small compared with the viscous contribution .",
