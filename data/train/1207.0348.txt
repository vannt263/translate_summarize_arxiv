    "strangeness production has always been an important observable for probing the state of matter created in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the yields of the various strange hadrons , properly normalized to those in elementary nucleon - nucleon interactions , are expected to exhibit different behavior in partonic than in hadronic environments @xcite .",
    "the number of created strange quark - antiquark pairs per participating nucleon is significantly higher in central pb+pb collisions than in p+p interactions at all collision energies .",
    "a maximum in the yield of the @xmath0  relative to that of the @xmath1  in central pb+pb collisions was observed by na49 at about 30  beam energy @xcite and interpreted as evidence for the onset of deconfinement .",
    "microscopic models such as hsd and urqmd do not predict a maximum . in the statistical model",
    "this structure can only be reproduced by including additional features like those introduced in @xcite , i.e. high mass resonances beyond the ones listed in @xcite and a significant contribution by @xmath2 meson states .",
    "there are no indications for a similar non - monotonic energy dependence of this ratio in p+p interactions . in order to better understand the observed maximum in the energy dependence observed in central pb+pb collisions , measurements of the system size dependence of strangeness production",
    "are needed for different strangeness carriers and at various energies .",
    "na49 has published data on the system - size dependence of hyperon ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) @xcite and ( anti-)proton yields and distributions @xcite in pb+pb collisions at 40  and 158  beam energy .",
    "results on pions , kaons , @xmath5 mesons and @xmath3  hyperons in c+c and si+si at 158  were reported in ref .",
    "pion and kaon production was also studied in p+p interactions at 158  @xcite .",
    "the present study completes these results by a measurement of the centrality dependence of pion and kaon production in pb+pb collisions at 40  and 158  beam energy as well as for c+c ( 66% most central ) and si+si ( 29% most central ) interactions at 40 .",
    "these results provide a link between the centrality selected data on pion and kaon production at lower ( sis , ags ) and higher ( rhic ) energy . at sis and ags energies kaon and pion production was studied in centrality selected au+au collisions as well as in collisions of smaller systems such as si+al @xcite . here , a rather linear increase is observed for relative kaon production with the number of participants . on the other hand , at rhic energies",
    "a clear saturation behavior is found for collisions with more than approximately 60 nucleons participating in the collision @xcite .",
    "the same observation has also been made at top sps energies comparing central c+c , si+si and pb+pb collisions @xcite .",
    "statistical models based on the grand - canonical ensemble ( g - ce ) have been used to describe strange particle yields in central collisions of heavy nuclei at high energies @xcite . for smaller reaction volumes , because of the lower number of produced strange quarks , restrictions due to strangeness conservation arise , which suppress strangeness production with respect to the infinite volume limit .",
    "this is taken into account by using canonical ensembles in the statistical model calculations .",
    "the transition from the canonical to the grand - canonical ensemble would thus result in a characteristic volume dependence of strangeness production @xcite .",
    "when comparing statistical model results to experimental data in terms of reaction volume , the latter has to be related to an experimental observable . in refs .",
    "@xcite the reaction volume was assumed to be proportional to the number of wounded nucleons ( see section iii ) . however with this approach the data at sps energies and above could not be described satisfactorily @xcite .",
    "good agreement can be achieved , if the relevant volume is subject to additional geometric constraints which restrict strangeness conservation to subvolumes , as realized for example in the percolation models .",
    "the corresponding calculations suggest that not only for small systems several subvolumes are formed , but that also in central collisions not all nucleon - nucleon collisions are included in the central volume @xcite . a simpler implementation of this ansatz is realized in the so - called core - corona model @xcite .",
    "it is built on the assumption that the fireball created in nuclear collisions is composed of a core , which has the same properties as a very central collision system , and a corona , which is a superposition of independent nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "the sizes of core and corona can be defined by the condition that the corona is formed by those nucleon - nucleon collisions in which both partners interact only once during the whole collision process .",
    "the fraction of single scatterings is calculated using straight line geometry as described in the glauber model @xcite .",
    "this approach was recently successfully applied to the system - size dependence of strangeness production at rhic energies @xcite and for the above mentioned hyperon production at sps @xcite .",
    "the common features of such model calculations at fixed energy are a fast increase of relative strangeness production with system size for small reaction volumes ( below approximately 60 participating nucleons ) and eventual saturation for large system sizes .",
    "the na49 detector is a large acceptance hadron spectrometer at the cern sps  @xcite .",
    "the main components are four large time projection chambers ( tpcs ) and two super - conducting dipole magnets with a one meter vertical gap , aligned in a row , and a total bending power of 9  tm .",
    "the magnetic field was set a factor of four lower for data taking at 40  than at 158 .",
    "two two - meter long tpcs ( vtpcs ) inside the magnets each with 72 pad - rows along the beam direction allow for precise tracking , momentum determination , vertex reconstruction , and particle identification ( pid ) by the measurement of the energy loss ( @xmath6 ) in the detector gas with a resolution of 6% .",
    "the other two tpcs ( mtpcs ) downstream of the magnets have large dimensions ( 4  m x 4  m x 1.2  m , 90 pad - rows ) and provide additional momentum resolution for high momentum particles as well as pid by @xmath6  measurement with a resolution of around 4% . a momentum resolution in the range @xmath7",
    "is achieved .",
    "two time - of - flight scintillator arrays of 891 pixels each ( tof ) , situated just behind the mtpcs symmetrically on either side of the beam axis , add additional k/@xmath8 separation power in the laboratory momentum range from one to ten  ( near mid - rapidity for kaons ) . a veto - calorimeter ( vcal ) placed 20 meters downstream of the target accepts all beam particles and projectile fragments as well as most of the spectator neutrons and protons @xcite .",
    "the geometrical acceptance of vcal was readjusted for each beam energy by means of a collimator for optimum projectile spectator coverage .",
    "vcal is used for off - line ( on - line ) selection of event centrality in pb+pb ( c+c and si+si ) collisions .",
    "the na49 detector is described in detail in reference  @xcite .    for pb+pb collisions a primary sps beam of 40  and 158was directed onto a pb target while for c+c and si+si interactions",
    "a fragmented pb beam of 40  was used .",
    "the fragments were identified by magnetic rigidity ( @xmath9 ) and by a pulse - height measurement in a scintillation counter in the beam . for c+c and si+si interactions",
    "beam particles with @xmath10 around 6 and @xmath10 around 14 , respectively , were selected online .",
    "a refined @xmath10 selection was done offline , which yielded a pure c - beam , whereas for the `` si - beam '' the different charges could not be separated well enough , thus a mixture of ions with @xmath10 = 13 , 14 , and 15 ( intensity ratio 34:44:22 ) were accepted .",
    "the target disks had thicknesses of 10  mm ( carbon ) , 5  mm ( silicon ) and 200  @xmath11 m ( lead ) corresponding to 7.9% , 4.4% , and 0.5% interaction lengths for the respective beam particles .",
    "the pb ( light ion ) beam passed through a quartz cherenkov ( scintillator ) detector , from which the start signal for the time - of - flight measurement was obtained , and three stations of multi - wire proportional chambers which measured the trajectory and energy loss of individual beam particles .",
    "a minimum bias trigger for pb+pb interactions was derived from the signal of a gas cherenkov device right behind the target .",
    "only interactions which reduce the beam charge and thus the signal seen by this detector by at least 10% were accepted .",
    "the interaction cross section thus defined is 5.7 b at both energies .",
    "the trigger for the c+c and si+si data taking at 40  was based on the energy deposited in vcal .",
    "the 66% most central c+c and 29% most central si+si interactions were selected by requiring an energy in vcal below the imposed threshold .",
    "these fractions are determined using the inelastic a+a cross sections ( 10% uncertainty ) , the trigger cross sections ( 5% uncertainty ) , and a simulation of the vcal response .",
    "the data sample used for this analysis was collected in specific minimum bias runs of the na49 experiment and thus are different from the central data presented earlier [ 2 ] .",
    "the recorded minimum bias pb+pb collisions were divided into five consecutive centrality bins : c0 - c4 ( see tab . [ centrality ] and ref .",
    "the centrality selection is based on the forward going energy of projectile spectators as measured in vcal .",
    "we quantify centrality by the fraction of cross - section according to intervals of forward going spectator energy . for each centrality interval a characteristic quantity , the mean value of `` wounded nucleons '' @xmath12  is calculated .",
    "a nucleon is considered wounded , if its interaction occurs in the nuclear overlap volume .",
    "@xmath12  is determined by generating vcal spectra with events from the venus 4.12 monte carlo code @xcite .",
    "the simulation took into account the energy resolution of the calorimeter and contributions of participants to the energy recorded by vcal .",
    "after cross calibration of experimental and simulated spectra for effects of the experimental trigger in the most peripheral centrality bin the meqan number of interacting ( wounded ) nucleons ( @xmath12 ) was extracted from the model data for each of the selected cross section fractions @xcite .",
    "the latter were selected to be identical at 40  and 158 .",
    "thus only insignificant differences of @xmath12  are observed between both energies except for the 10% discrepancy in the most peripheral centrality interval which we attribute to the slightly different online trigger conditions .",
    "table [ centrality ] summarizes these numbers together with the number of analyzed events .",
    "for convenience we quote here the centrality of the c+c and si+si collisions at 158  @xcite which are used for comparison in this paper : the most central 15.3% ( @xmath132 ) and 12.2% ( @xmath143 ) , respectively",
    ".    .[centrality ] overview of the analyzed data and centrality classes for minimum bias pb+pb collisions .",
    "the centrality is given as fraction of the total inelastic cross section .",
    "@xmath15 is the average number of wounded nucleons per event , and @xmath16 the number of analyzed events .",
