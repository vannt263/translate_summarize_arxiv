    "pg1159 stars form a spectroscopic group of about 40 very hot , h - deficient post - agb stars .",
    "fuse spectroscopy of four pg1159 stars , namely k1 - 16 , ngc7094 , abell78 ( [ wc]-pg1159 ) , and pg1159@xmath0035 has shown that these are fe deficient @xcite .",
    "reasons for this phenomenon may be dust - fractionation ( depleted elements are incorporated in dust grains and are then expelled from the photosphere by radiation pressure ) or the s - process ( n captures during the agb phase ) which transforms fe into trans - iron elements .",
    "the detection of s - process signatures in h - deficient post - agb stars can verify our current understanding of the synthesis of trans - iron elements in agb stars : these stars contribute to the metal enrichment of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and hence affect the galactic chemical evolution .",
    "the planetary nebula ( pn ) ngc7094 ( png066.7@xmath028.2 ) has been identified by ( k1@xmath019 , * ? ? ?",
    "according to @xcite its distance is 2.2 kpc and its apparent size is 1025@xmath1994 @xcite .",
    "its central star ( cs ) is of so - called hybrid pg1159-type , i.e. it exhibits h in its spectrum .",
    "@xcite determined @xmath2 = 110kk , @xmath3 , h=0.36 , he=0.43 , and c=0.21 ( mass fractions ) . @xcite",
    "have shown that the star is fe deficient . in this analysis",
    ", we aim to determine the abundances of trans - iron elements in its photosphere . due to the lack of reliable atomic data ,",
    "we are restricted to ni , only .    at the relevant @xmath2 , nivi and nivii",
    "are the dominant ionisation stages in the line - forming region .",
    "unfortunately , the strongest nivii lines are located at lower wavelengths than the fuse range includes .",
    "most of the nivi lines are accessible in the stis wavelength range . based on fuse and stis observations ,",
    "we perform a nlte spectral analysis in order to determine the ni abundance .",
    "the fuv spectrum of ngc7094 is strongly contaminated by interstellar absorption lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ism ] ) .",
    "these hamper the identification of stellar photospheric lines .",
    "thus , modeling the ism is inevitable for a precise analysis of the fuse observation .",
    "moreover , the fuv and uv spectra contain a number of lines which display p cygni profiles ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : ism ] ) due to the stellar wind .",
    "@xcite determined a terminal wind velocity of @xmath4 , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hst / ghrs and iue observations ) determined mass - loss rates of @xmath5 from civ @xmath61548.2 , 1550.8and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* orfeus ) measured @xmath7 from ovi @xmath61031.9 , 1037.6 .    in order to reproduce the observations , we have to model both , the photospheric spectrum as well as the ism absorption lines . for our photospheric models ,",
    "we adopt the parameters by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see above ) .",
    "we employed _ tmap _ , the tbingen nlte model atmosphere package @xcite , to calculate those photospheric lines which are not affected by the stellar wind .",
    "we consider opacities of all elements from h to ni .    for the calculation of lines which display p cygni profiles we used the wind code by l. koesterke ( priv .",
    "comm . ) . from nevii @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ism ] ) , we determined @xmath9 and @xmath7 .",
    "this is in agreement with the values given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the ism absorption lines are modeled with the owens program which takes into account different radial and turbulent velocities , temperatures , chemical compositions , as well as column densities for each included element .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ism ] , we show a comparison of our synthetic spectra with the observations .",
    "the combination of photospheric and ism models is in good agreement with the observations and fine - tuning of the parameters will improve the result .    our spectral analysis of the stis and fuse observation of the cspn ngc7094 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : feni ] ) confirms the fe underabundance found by @xcite .",
    "we can determine an even lower upper limit of 0.025 times the solar abundance .",
    "one explanation for the iron - deficiency and the non - existing nickel overabundance in ngc7094 could be that iron was transformed by n - captures to even heavier elements than nickel .",
    "we presently are unable to test this idea because of the lack of atomic data .",
    "we would like to stress that , in contrast to the other pg1159 stars , the mere iron - deficiency in ngc7094 is particularly mysterious , because it is a hybrid - pg1159 star .",
    "we recall that the hybrid - pg1159 stars are the outcome of an aftp ( agb final thermal pulse ) with residual hydrogen ( h@xmath10 ) from the envelope that was mixed with intershell matter ( werner et al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "one would expect to see at least the iron that was contained in the convective h - envelope , hence fe / h @xmath11solar , i.e. , @xmath12 ( by mass ) .",
    "this is not the case in ngc7094 : the upper limit for fe / h ratio is much smaller : @xmath13 .",
