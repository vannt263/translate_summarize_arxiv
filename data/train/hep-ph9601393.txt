    "high - energy experiments at @xmath7 colliders have proved to be very fruitful . the construction of high energy @xmath6 colliders has not been pursued as actively .",
    "the probable reason for this lack of activity is the absence of @xmath8-channel resonance production and pair production for new particles in @xmath6 collisions due to lepton number conservation .",
    "however , precisely because direct channel resonances are not expected , high energy @xmath6 collisions could be a clean way to uncover physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "this has become evident from the works presented in this workshop.@xcite    in this presentation , we discuss the production of the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson ( @xmath9 ) , and the associated production with a weak boson .",
    "we also study the possibility of detecting strong @xmath3 scattering in the @xmath10 channel , which is unique for an @xmath6 collider , and quantitatively evaluate the enhancement of @xmath3 production due to a doubly - charged higgs boson . the results presented here",
    "are essentially based on two recent papers.@xcite",
    "in @xmath6 collisions single higgs boson production at lowest order can occur via the processes @xmath11    ( emem_higgs.ps width 17 cm )    the cross sections are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : higgs](a ) versus c. m. energy @xmath12 for @xmath13  gev and ( b ) versus @xmath14 at @xmath15  tev . for @xmath16  gev and @xmath15  tev",
    "the cross section is 9  fb for @xmath17 via @xmath18 . in comparison ,",
    "the higgs production cross sections in @xmath7 collisions for the same @xmath12 and @xmath19 are 95  fb for @xmath20 and 60  fb for @xmath21 mechanisms.@xcite searching for the sm higgs boson in @xmath6 collisions is limited by the rather small cross sections , especially for heavier @xmath14 .    for @xmath22 gev or so",
    ", the higgs boson decays dominantly to @xmath23 and a higgs signal identification is quite feasible .",
    "the only complication comes from the case in which @xmath19 is close to @xmath24 , when the @xmath25-production processes @xmath26 are large backgrounds to the higgs processes ( [ eq : smhiggs ] ) respectively .",
    "for example , for the production of a 100  gev higgs boson at @xmath15  tev , @xmath27  fb and @xmath28  fb ( with @xmath29 ) . however , it is important to notice that the higgs signal is very distinctive .",
    "the @xmath9-production is central while the @xmath25-production is peaked at forward and backward scattering angles ; thus the @xmath25 background can be selectively suppressed by angular cuts .",
    "( emem_mhiggs.ps width 11 cm )    to address the @xmath9 signal observability quantitatively , we evaluate the complete @xmath30 background including both @xmath31 with @xmath32 and the two - photon production of @xmath23 .",
    "based on the fact that the two - photon background can be reduced substantially by keeping the photon propagators far off - shell , we impose the following acceptance cuts @xmath33 s in the final state ( since the @xmath34 s in the signal events are populated at high transverse momenta @xmath35 ) : @xmath36    .",
    "the higgs boson signal in the production of @xmath0 for @xmath37@xmath38 gev and the background from @xmath39 with the invariant mass of the @xmath23 pair in the range @xmath40 , with @xmath41  gev . for simplicity",
    "we take b@xmath42 , and assume that all the signal falls within @xmath43 .",
    "the acceptance cuts are @xmath44 gev and @xmath45 on the final state electrons , and @xmath46 gev and @xmath47 on the final state @xmath34 s . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     at @xmath48 tev , the signal rate is reduced by 40% , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate ] ) , which makes the signal observation more difficult .",
    "an improvement was made to include the @xmath49 discrimination through the di - jet mass of their decay products .",
    "typically , one assumes the jet energy resolution to be@xcite @xmath50 in gev units ( where the symbol @xmath51 means adding in quadrature ) .",
    "if we now identify dijets having measured mass in the intervals @xmath52 \\quad { \\rm and } \\quad \\left[{1\\over 2}(m_w+m_z ) , \\ ; 1.15m_z\\right]\\ ] ] as @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively , then simulation@xcite indicates that true @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 events will be interpreted statistically as follows : @xmath58 this helps improve the signal observability and the results are shown in table  [ table3 ]",
    ".    the use of @xmath59 ( with @xmath34-tagging ) , with combined branching fraction of about 22% , could be helpful in determining the contribution of the @xmath60 background process and further improving the signal identification .",
    "( emem_hmm.ps width 11 cm )    a search for a doubly - charged higgs boson in a model with a scalar triplet could also be carried out at an @xmath6 collider .",
    "what makes the @xmath6 collider unique in this instance is that the doubly - charged higgs boson can be produced as an @xmath8-channel resonance .",
    "jack gunion@xcite recently discussed the lepton - number violating process @xmath62 and found interesting results .",
    "we here consider the process @xmath63 followed by @xmath64 decays .",
    "detailed analyses of the doublet plus triplet model can be found in the literature@xcite and we will not repeat the discussion of the model here . with certain assumptions for simplicity ,",
    "there are then two independent parameters left in the model:@xcite the mass parameter @xmath65 and the mixing angle @xmath66 between the higgs doublet and the triplet fields , which is related to the ratio of the vacuum expectation values .",
    "figure  [ fig : hmm ] presents the @xmath67 distribution at @xmath15  tev including the resonance process @xmath68 with @xmath69 or 0.3  gev , taking maximum mixing @xmath70 .",
    "a significant enhancement above the sm background occurs .",
    "if existed at all , such a doubly - charged higgs boson should manifest itself in @xmath71 collisions .",
    "discussions here should be essentially applicable for the doubly - charged vector bosons as well.@xcite",
    "we have calculated the single and associated higgs boson production and found that they may give observable signals , although the cross sections are generally not as large as those in @xmath7 collisions .",
    "we have also investigated the possibility of observing strong @xmath72 scattering , which occurs through the weak isospin @xmath10 channel and is unique to @xmath6 collisions .",
    "we have developed certain kinematic cuts to significantly reduce the @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath60 backgrounds to the strong @xmath76 signal in hadronic decay modes .",
    "the @xmath60 background persists at large @xmath77 , which makes the observation of strong @xmath72 scattering difficult . on the other hand ,",
    "if good jet energy resolution can be obtained , then @xmath78 and @xmath25 may be distinguished so that the `` faked '' background from @xmath79 final state may be further suppressed .",
    "if doubly - charged higgs bosons exist , the @xmath8-channel enhancement in @xmath3 final state would be very substantial at an @xmath6 collider .",
    "finally , by colliding @xmath80 beams the strong @xmath81 signal in the process @xmath82 can be enhanced over the @xmath75 , @xmath83 , and @xmath60 backgrounds .",
    "similarly , the @xmath4 signal will be favored with the use of @xmath84 beams .",
    "this survey of cross sections and processes should provide useful benchmarks for serious studies of the potential of such a machine for new physics discovery .",
