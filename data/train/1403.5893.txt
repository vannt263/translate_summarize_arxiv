    "the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model with the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , first introduced in 1963 @xcite , is the simplest model that describes the interaction between a two - level atom and a single mode quantized radiation field .",
    "the rwa is applicable when the applied electromagnetic field frequency @xmath2 is near resonance with the atom transition frequency @xmath3 and the interaction between the atom and the radiation field is weak .",
    "the reason is that the contribution of the counter - rotating terms of the system is very small .",
    "typical new era of experiments witness the breakdown of the jc model in terms of both coupling and detuning , including circuit qed experiments with superconducting qubits coupled to lc and waveguide resonators @xcite and cooper - pair boxes or josephson phase qubits coupled to nanomechanical resonators @xcite .",
    "each of these artificial atoms has an internal degree of freedom ( d.o.f . )",
    "that can be either up or down , creating a spin-1/2 system .",
    "these systems generally allow coupling strengths up to @xmath4 in the so - called ultrastrong coupling regime , or the qubit transition frequency far - detuned from the field frequency @xcite .",
    "an adiabatic approximation approach @xcite was proposed to treat the parameter regime outside the near - resonance and weak - coupling assumption of rwa based on the displaced oscillator basis . in this basis",
    "the hamiltonian are truncated to a block - diagonal form and the blocks are solved individually .",
    "the time evolution of the two - level - system occupation probability with thermal and coherent state initial conditions for the oscillator exhibits clear signals of collapse and revival .",
    "the quantum rabi model @xcite , or jc model without the rwa , was recently declared solved exactly in @xcite . by means of the representation of bosonic operators in the bargmann space braak",
    "argued that the regular spectrum of the rabi model was given by the zeros of a transcendental function , which is given as an infinite power series .",
    "al . mapped the model to a polynomial equation with a single variable in terms of tunable extended bosonic coherent states @xcite .",
    "they recover braak s exact solution in an alternative more physical way and point out that both methods have one thing in common : the spectrum can not be obtained without truncation in the power series @xcite .",
    "thus the rabi model is quasi - exactly solvable in the sense that only a finite part of the spectrum can be obtained in closed form and the remaining part of the spectrum can only be determined by numerical means @xcite . the number of ca .",
    "1350 calculable energy levels in each parity subspace are obtained in double precision by an elementary stepping algorithm up to two orders of magnitude higher than braak s solution @xcite .",
    "quantum integrability is , according to braak s criterion , equivalent to the existence of quantum numbers that classify eigenstates uniquely .",
    "the rabi model is integrable because it has two d.o.f . and",
    "the eigenstates can be uniquely labelled by two quantum numbers associated with the energy and the parity , respectively .",
    "moreover , examples of nonintegrable but ( quasi)exactly solvable system are given with broken parity symmetry or vanished level splitting of an additional qubit @xcite .",
    "these theoretical progress has renewed the interest in the rabi and related models .",
    "analytical solutions of this model have brought clarity and intuition to several important problems and experimental results in contemporary quantum information .",
    "furthermore , it is expected that the experiments could reach the deep strong coupling regime @xcite where the ratio of the coupling strength to the relevant frequencies exceeds unity .",
    "perturbative methods and the concept of rabi oscillations should be superseded by novel physics such as parity chains and photon number wave packets .",
    "to describe the collective behavior of multiple atomic dipoles interacting with an electromagnetic field mode , the dicke model @xcite was introduced where the pauli operators are summed and transformed into a bosonic operator .",
    "though very successful in treating the system of an alkaline atomic ensemble @xcite in an optical microcavity with the number of atoms over @xmath5 , it does not apply well to the case of multiqubit superconducting circuits with @xmath6 .",
    "theoretical studies for a finite number @xmath7 of qubits in the system often employ the tavis - cummings ( tc ) model @xcite under rwa , where all the spins are grouped into a total large spin .",
    "the tc model has received much attention and has been involved in both experiments and theories @xcite .",
    "being exactly solvable only when the coupling is homogeneous and when the eigenfrequencies between the qubits and the photon mode are equal , it was recently agarwal extended beyond the rwa for quasi - degenerate qubits in the parameter regime in which the frequencies of the qubits are much smaller than the oscillator frequency and the coupling strength is allowed to be ultrastrong .",
    "the case of inhomogeneous coupling is drastically different - there is no such straightforward way to access the hilbert space .",
    "the extension to the inhomogeneous coupling system is limited to rwa lopez , ian or numerical exact approach on the entanglement evolution of two independent jc atoms @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that more efforts are paid to the system composed of two nonidentical qubits @xcite , or the @xmath8 dicke model which couples three qubits to a single radiation mode and constitutes the simplest quantum - optical system allowing for greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states @xcite .",
    "we in this paper solve the tc model beyond the rwa with @xmath7 qubits coupled to a single oscillator mode by comprehensively considering the recently developed approaches in solving the jc model with extension to the case of inhomogeneous coupling .",
    "a systematic truncated method is developed in finding the exact wave functions of the model with @xmath7 discrete and one continuous d.o.f . in the basis of the displaced operators we construct the hamiltonian by primitive building blocks and",
    "allow transitions between adjacent blocks in addition .",
    "we take mainly arbitrary two qubits interacting with a bose field as an example .",
    "the analytical eigensolutions are derived in the zeroth - order and first - order approximation to the exact wave function in deep strong coupling parameter regimes .",
    "the procedure is easily extended to systems with more than two qubits .",
    "we further examine the solvability and integrability of the system and level crossing points in the energy spectrum of the same parity space are related to a hidden symmetry in the system .",
    "then , starting from any initial state of the system we are able to derive the time evolution properties of the qubits by using a linear combination of the analytical eigensolutions and tracing over the oscillator field . in other words ,",
    "some general techniques are applied to investigate the time evolution of the rather complicated multiqubit - field system .",
    "subsequently , we can apply the approximated eigensolutions to study the dynamical evolution of the entanglement between the two qubits as a fundamental consequence of quantum mechanics and as a resource for communication and information processing @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the analytical eigen solutions of the tc model beyond the rwa is given after introducing the general procedure of constructing the determinant of the secular equation .",
    "iii is devoted to the dynamical behaviors of the qubits , in which the analytical eigensolutions are employed to approximately describe the time evolution of the probability of finding both qubits in their initial state and the population inversion when the quantum field is prepared initially in the displaced coherent state . in sec .",
    "iv we further study the entanglement dynamics for two qubits starting from the bell state and the field in a coherent state . finally , we make some discussions on the characteristics of case of unequal coupling strengthes for the two qubits from the present study in sec . v.",
    "the system we consider here consists of @xmath7 qubits inhomogeneously interacting with a single - mode bose field .",
    "it is described by the tc hamiltonian beyond the rwa ( we set @xmath9 ) @xcite@xmath10where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the bosonic creation ( annihilation ) operator of the single bosonic mode with frequency @xmath13 , @xmath3 denotes the energy splitting of @xmath14-th qubit described by pauli matrices @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , and @xmath17 is the dipole - field coupling strength between the qubit @xmath14 and the field .",
    "here we have rotated the system around the @xmath18axis by an angle @xmath19 realized through a unitary transformation @xcite @xmath20 .",
    "basically the calculation here applies to arbitrary non - identical two - level atoms and non - uniform coupling strengths @xmath21 in any form .",
    "we also note that the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) conserves the global parity operator defined as @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath23 = 0 $ ] . in the following we use the parity operator to decompose the hilbert space into even and odd subspaces .    for the convenience of description , we take @xmath24 as an illustrative example .",
    "denote the upper and lower eigenstates of @xmath25 as @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively .",
    "formally we treat qubit 2 as a new member to the rabi model @xcite and unfold the dimension of the space from 2 to 4 . in the basis of product space of the two qubits , i.e. @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 , and @xmath31 ,",
