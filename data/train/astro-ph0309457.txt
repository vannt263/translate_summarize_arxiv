    "the observation of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) has now spanned over forty years . over that period ,",
    "many source models have been proposed to explain the origin of these remarkable events . in the past five years , theoretical models",
    "have been suggested that would potentially produce dipole distributions oriented towards m87 @xcite or centaurus a @xcite .",
    "in addition , the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) has reported findings suggesting a 4% dipole - like enhancement oriented towards the galactic center present in its events with energies around @xmath1  ev @xcite .",
    "this result seemed to be corroborated by findings published by the fly s eye experiment in 1999 that suggested the possibility of an enhancement in the galactic plane also at energies around @xmath1  ev @xcite , and also by a re - analysis of data from the sugar array that was published in 2001 @xcite that showed an enhancement in the general vicinity of the galactic center .",
    "however , both agasa and fly s eye are subject to a limiting factor ; they are both located too far north in latitude to directly observe the galactic center itself .",
    "the re - analysis of sugar data actually demonstrated an excess that was offset from the galactic center by @xmath2 and was more consistent with a point source than a global dipole effect @xcite .",
    "while the current high resolution fly s eye ( hires ) experiment is subject to a similar limitation in sky coverage as the agasa and fly s eye experiments , we will show that , by properly estimating the hires aperture and angular resolution , we can effectively exclude these dipole source models to a certain degree of sensitivity .",
    "however , we are not able to completely exclude the findings of agasa or the theoretical predictions mentioned above .    our methods for detecting the presence of a dipole source model will be based upon comparisons between the real data and a large quantity of events generated by our monte carlo simulation program .",
    "the simulated data possess the same aperture and exposure as the actual hires - i monocular data set . in order to measure the presence of a dipole effect in our event sample , we use first a conventional binning technique that considers the event counts for the full range of opening angles from the center of each proposed dipole distribution .",
    "we then show how the asymmetric angular resolution of a monocular air fluorescence detector can be accommodated in this method .",
    "we ascertain the 90% confidence interval for a dipole source model for each of the three dipoles considered by comparing our real data with large numbers of similar - sized simulated data sets .",
    "we then consider the effects of systematic uncertainties on our measurements . to conclude",
    ", we use a novel technique measuring the information dimension @xcite , @xmath3 , of our sample to place an independent 90% confidence interval on the scaling parameter , @xmath4 , that we use to quantify our dipole source model .",
    "a dipole source model can be described , as first proposed by farrar and piran @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the relative density of cosmic rays in a given direction , @xmath7 is the opening angle between that direction and the global maximum of the distribution , and @xmath4 is the customary anisotropy amplitude @xcite : @xmath8 the cases of @xmath9 and @xmath10 correspond to 100% dipole distributions in the direction of the center and anti - center of the dipole source model , respectively .",
    "the case of @xmath11 corresponds to an isotropic source model .    a simple scheme for measuring @xmath4 consists of constructing a _ dipole function _ in the following manner :    1 .",
    "the opening angle is measured between the arrival direction of an event and the center of the proposed dipole source model .",
    "the cosine of the opening angle is then histogrammed .",
    "the preceding steps are repeated until all of the events are considered .",
    "the resulting curve produced by the histogram is the dipole function .",
    "the dipole function has two variable parameters : the bin width , @xmath12 , and the total number of counts in all of the bins . at first glance",
    ", it would seem that the total bin count is fixed upon the total number of events , but we will show that this is nt necessarily the case when we consider how to accommodate angular resolution .    in the simplest case of a sample that contains a very large number of events with a constant exposure and aperture over the entire sky , the dipole function will be proportional to equation [ equation : dipole ] .",
    "we propose two simple ways that one can quantify the dipole function for this sample ; the most obvious way is to consider its slope .",
    "we can see by referring to equation [ equation : dipole ] that this is equal to @xmath13 .",
    "a second way of quantifying @xmath4 is to consider the mean cosine value , @xmath14 for the dipole function : @xmath15 both methods of quantification produce values that are dependent upon @xmath4 .",
    "while the dependence of @xmath14 is linear in @xmath4 for the case of homogeneous full - sky coverage , we will find that this is not necessarily the case when considering the cumulative exposure of a ground - based air fluorescence detector .",
    "we now consider the real data sample consisting of events that were included in the hires - i monocular spectrum measurement @xcite .",
    "this set contains 1526 events observed between may  1997 and february  2003 with measured energies greater than @xmath0  ev . the hires monocular data set represents a cumulative exposure of @xmath16  km@xmath17sr@xmath18yr at @xmath19  ev .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we are able to place upper limits on the value of @xmath20 for each of our three proposed dipole source models . however , these limits are not small enough to exclude the theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "also , they do not exclude the findings of the agasa collaboration in terms of the intensity of the dipole effect that they observed or in terms of the energy considered because the events in the dipole effect observed by the agasa detector possessed energies below @xmath0  ev @xcite .",
    "since it appears that angular resolution has little impact on the measurement of @xmath4 and we do not appear to be systematically limited , we conclude that the driving factor in making a better determination of @xmath4 will simply be larger event samples .",
    "hires - i mono will continue to have the largest cumulative aperture of any single detector for the next three to five years , thus it will continue to serve as an ever more powerful tool for constraining dipole source models .",
