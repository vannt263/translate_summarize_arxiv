    "a major goal in investigating the scaling violations of the structure functions as measured in deeply inelastic scattering is to determine the qcd scale parameter @xmath3 , or equivalently the strong coupling constant @xmath4 , at a typical reference scale @xmath5 .",
    "the qcd renormalization group equations for mass factorization at space  like momentum transfer are solved referring to either @xmath6space @xcite or mellin ",
    "space @xcite representations .",
    "the formulation of the evolution equations in mellin space has the advantage that only ordinary differential equations , unlike integro - differential equations in @xmath6-space , have to be solved .",
    "moreover , to maintain factorization ",
    "scheme invariance the evolution equations have to be consistently expanded in the strong coupling constant , which allows an analytic integration of the differential equations , i.e. a complete analytic solution .",
    "the only numerical element consists in the inverse mellin transform of the solution to @xmath6space via a contour integral around the singularities of the solution in the complex @xmath0plane .",
    "the solution in fixed order perturbation theory has isolated poles on the real axis bounded by some positive number from above .",
    "resummations of small@xmath6 contributions can be easily implemented in this approach in a consistent way  @xcite . in the qcd fit",
    "only the parameters of the non  perturbative input distributions and @xmath3 have to be varied and the evolution kernels consisting out of the anomalous dimensions and the wilson coefficients to the respective order in the coupling constant need not to be recalculated but are kept fixed as ( tabulated ) @xmath7dependent arrays along the contour used for the numerical mellin inversion .",
    "this makes qcd fits using mellin ",
    "space programs particularly fast .",
    "the analytic solution of the evolution equations in mellin space allows to study factorization ",
    "scheme invariant evolution equations of different kind  @xcite .",
    "these equations describe the evolution of physical observables . in the non  singlet case",
    "a flavor non  singlet combination of structure functions forms the input distribution , which can be measured at a starting scale @xmath8 .",
    "the usual flavor singlet evolution can be mapped into the evolution of two structure functions as e.g. @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 , or @xmath2 and @xmath12 , @xcite . here",
    "the non  perturbative input distributions are formed by the measured structure functions at a scale @xmath8 , and have therefore not to be determined in the qcd  analysis .",
    "the evolution kernels in @xmath6space are complicated multiple mellin convolutions of wilson coefficients , splitting functions @xmath13 and of some mellin ",
    "inverse splitting functions and wilson coefficients in general ,  see  @xcite .",
    "these physical evolution kernels can be easily calculated in analytic form in mellin@xmath0 space unlike in @xmath6space , where , as is well known , already the mellin  inverse of leading order splitting functions takes a complicated form  @xcite and the convolutions to be performed were never done analytically .",
    "due to the sizeable contribution of charm to the structure functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the kinematic regime of hera ( @xmath14 ) an exact treatment requires the account for heavy quark effects on @xmath9 and @xmath10 which is easiest described in analytic form in mellin@xmath0 space .",
    "the standard qcd analysis and fits using scheme ",
    "invariant evolution provide different methods to determine the strong coupling constant @xmath15 . in the upcoming high  precision analyses , which aim on measurement errors of @xmath16 , it is of particular importance to diminish all theoretical and conceptual uncertainties . for this purpose",
    "the use of both these methods will be essential .",
    "so far no specific representation of the heavy flavor wilson coefficients in mellin@xmath0 space , in the way used for those of the light flavors , were derived .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to present these parameterizations in terms of a semi - analytic approach .",
    "the representation is based on meromorphic functions in the mellin variable @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath17 dependence is given by a series of numerical expansion coefficients until a desired accuracy is reached .",
    "interpolations in the variable @xmath18 are used along the inversion contour to keep the analysis as fast as possible .",
    "the present parameterizations enable to perform scheme ",
    "invariant evolutions including the effect of heavy flavor coefficient functions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we summarize the basic notations to describe the neutral  current heavy flavor contributions to deep ",
    "inelastic scattering up to next  to  leading order  @xcite . in section  3",
    "we present the parameterization of the different contributions to the qcd wilson coefficients for heavy flavor production for complex values of mellin@xmath0 and apply these representations to calculate the heavy flavor structure functions using sample densities for the light partons , including the study of their accuracy .",
    "section  4 contains the conclusions .",
