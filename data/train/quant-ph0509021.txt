    "entanglement is the physical property that schrdinger described as _ not one but the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics_. it has played a fundamental role in the study of the completeness of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "nowadays , in quantum information theory , entanglement is considered as a physical resource , equivalent in many aspects to the role energy played in classical and quantum mechanics .",
    "most applications in this novel field , like quantum teleportation  @xcite , quantum communication  @xcite , quantum cryptography  @xcite , and some algorithms of quantum computation are carried out by using this intriguing quantum property  @xcite .",
    "a thorough study of entanglement in quantum information theory would demand a natural classification between discrete  @xcite and continuous variables  @xcite .    in the last few years two apparently different fields , entanglement and relativity ,",
    "have experienced intense research in an effort for treating them in a common framework  @xcite .",
    "most of those works investigated the lorentz covariance of entanglement through purely kinematic considerations , and only a few of them studied _ ab initio _ the entanglement dynamics .",
    "for example , in the context of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , pachos and solano @xcite considered the generation and degree of entanglement of spin correlations in the scattering process of a pair of massive spin-@xmath0 charged particles , for an initially pure product state , in the low - energy limit and to the lowest order in qed .",
    "manoukian and yongram @xcite computed the effect of spin polarization on correlations in a similar model , but also for the case of two photons created after @xmath1 annihilation , analyzing the violation of bell s inequality @xcite .",
    "in an earlier work , grobe et al .",
    "@xcite studied , in the nonrelativistic limit , the dynamics of entanglement in position / momentum of two electrons which interact with each other and with a nucleus via a smoothed coulomb potential .",
    "they found that the associated quantum correlations manifest a tendency to increase as a function of the interaction time .    in this paper ,",
    "we study to the lowest order in qed the interaction of a pair of identical , charged , massive spin-1/2 particles , and how this interaction increases the entanglement in the particle momenta as a function of time .",
    "we chose to work at lowest order , where entanglement already appears full - fledged , precisely for its simplicity .",
    "in particular this allows to set aside neatly other intricacies of qed , whose influence on entanglement should be subject of separate analysis . here , the generation of entanglement is a consequence of a conservation law : the total relativistic four - momentum is preserved in the system evolution .",
    "this will also be the case in any interaction verifying this conservation law , as occurs in closed multipartite systems , while allowing the change in the individual momentum of each component . in the asymptotic limit , the infinite spacetime intervals involved in the s - matrix result in the generation of an infinite amount of entanglement for interacting particles with well - defined momentum .",
    "qed is a place where infinities can be avoided , and this will be also true , even though for other physical reasons , in the case of divergences appearing in momentum entanglement , a distinctive feature of continuous variables  @xcite .",
    "we will also discuss two different possibilities of establishing transfer of entanglement between momentum and spin degrees of freedom in the collective two - particle system : through dynamical operations or lorentz boosts .    in sec .",
    "[ fte ] , we analize at lowest order and at finite time the generation of momentum entanglement between two electrons . in sec .",
    "[ ges ] , we calculate the schmidt decomposition of the amplitude of a pair of spin-1/2 particles , showing the growth of momentum entanglement as they interact via qed .",
    "we obtain also analytic approximations of the schmidt modes , both , in momentum and configuration spaces . in appendix",
    "[ entangfi ] , we include some notations and definitions related to entanglement theory for discrete and continuous variables . in appendix",
    "[ maj ] , we address the possibilities of transferring entanglement between momenta and spins via dynamical action , with local operations and classical communication ( locc ) , or via kinematical action , with lorentz transformations .",
    "to address the properties of entanglement of a two electron system one needs the amplitude ( wave function ) @xmath2 of the system , an object with 16 spinor components dependent on the configuration space variables @xmath3 , @xmath4 of both particles .",
    "the wave functions were studied perturbatively by bethe and salpeter  @xcite and their evolution equation was also given by gell - mann and low  @xcite .",
    "the wave function development is closely related to the two particle green function , @xmath5 which describes ( in the heisenberg picture ) the symmetrized probability amplitude for one electron to proceed from the event @xmath6 to the event @xmath3 while the other proceeds from @xmath7 to @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath8 describes the electron at 3 and @xmath9 the one at 4 , then @xmath10 will be their correlated amplitude at 1 , 2 . in the free case",
    "this is just @xmath11 , but the interaction will produce a reshuffling of momenta and spins that may lead to entanglement .",

    "given a state @xmath146 , it is defined as the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix with respect to @xmath160 or @xmath161 , @xmath162 where the @xmath103 s are given in eq .",

    "an interesting work where the schmidt decomposition for continuous variables is analyzed discretizing the corresponding integral equations can be found in ref .",
    "another method for obtaining the continuous variables schmidt decomposition , based in decomposing the bipartite wave function in complete sets of orthonormal functions , is developed in ref .",
    "in sec.[ges ] we computed the entanglement in momenta for a pair of identical spin-1/2 particles which interact through exchange of a virtual photon .",
    "the sharper the initial momentum distribution of the incident fermion , and the longer the interaction time , the larger the entanglement in momenta .",
    "heisenberg s principle , on the other hand , establishes a limit to the precision with which the momentum may be defined and hence to the achievable degree of entanglement .",
    "it is possible , in principle , to transform the entanglement in momenta into entanglement in spins .",
    "this is easily seen in terms of the majorization criterion  @xcite , which is of practical interest because the experimentalist usually manipulates spins . here",
    ", we will analyze this entanglement transfer .",
    "majorization is an area of mathematics which predates quantum mechanics . quoting nielsen and chuang , `` majorization is an ordering on d - dimensional real vectors intended to capture the notion that one vector is more or less disordered than another '' .",
    "we consider a pair of @xmath167-dimensional vectors , @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "we say @xmath170 is majorized by @xmath171 , written @xmath172 , if @xmath173 for @xmath174 , with equality instead of inequality for @xmath175 .",
    "we denote by @xmath176 the components of @xmath177 in decreasing order @xmath178 .",
    "the interest of this work in the majorization concept comes from a theorem which states that a bipartite pure state @xmath179 may be transformed to another pure state @xmath180 by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) if and only if @xmath181 , where @xmath182 , @xmath183 are the vectors of ( square ) coefficients of the schmidt decomposition of the states @xmath179 , @xmath180 , respectively .",
    "locc adds to those quantum operations effected only locally the possibility of classical communication between spatially separated parts of the system .",
    "according to this criterion , it would be possible in principle to obtain a singlet spin state @xmath180 beginning with a momentum entangled state @xmath179 whenever @xmath181 .",
    "the possibility of obtaining a singlet spin state from a momentum - entangled state can be extended to a more efficient situation : the possibility of distillation of entanglement .",
    "this idea consists on obtaining multiple singlet states beginning with several copies of a given pure state @xmath179 .",
    "the distillable entanglement of @xmath179 consists in the ratio @xmath184 , where @xmath185 is the number of copies of @xmath179 we have initially , and @xmath104 the number of singlet states we are able to obtain via locc acting on these copies .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that for pure states the distillable entanglement equals the entropy of entanglement , s. thus , in the continuous case ( infinite - dimensional hilbert space ) , the distillable entanglement is not bounded from above , because neither is s. according to this , the larger the entanglement in momenta the more singlet states could be obtained with locc .",
    "another approach to the study of entanglement transfer between momentum and spin degrees of freedom is the kinematical one .",
    "in fact , the lorentz transformations may entangle the spin and momentum degrees of freedom . to be more explicit , and following the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider a certain bipartite pure wave function @xmath190 for two spin-1/2 fermions , where @xmath88 and @xmath74 denote respectively the spin degrees of freedom of each of the two fermions , and @xmath191 and @xmath192 the corresponding momenta .",
    "this would appear to an observer in a lorentz transformed frame as @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the spin 1/2 representation of the wigner rotation @xmath195 .",
    "the wigner rotations of eq .",
    "( [ eqmced5 ] ) can be seen as conditional logical operators , which rotate the spin a certain angle depending on the value of the momentum .",
    "thus , a lorentz transformation will modify in general the entanglement between momentum and spin of each individual electron .",
    "we distinguish the following three cases .",
    "\\i ) _ product state in all variables .",
    "_ in this case , @xmath196 and the entanglement at the rest reference frame is zero . under a boost , the wigner rotations of eq .",
    "( [ eqmced5 ] ) entangle the momentum of each fermion with its spin , and thus the entanglement momentum - spin grows  @xcite .",
    "\\ii ) _ entangled state spin - spin and/or momentum - momentum . _",
    "we consider now a state @xmath197 with @xmath180 an arbitrary state of the spins , and @xmath198 an arbitrary state of the momenta . in this case",
    ", a lorentz boost will entangle in general each spin with its corresponding momentum , and a careful analysis shows that the spin - spin entanglement never grows  @xcite .",
    "of course , by applying the reversed boost the entanglement momentum - spin would be transferred back to the spin - spin one , and thus the latter would grow .",
    "this particular case shows that , for the state we considered in sec .",
    "[ ges ] , given by eqs .",
    "( [ eqsges1 ] ) , ( [ eqsges1bis ] ) and ( [ eqsges3 ] ) , the entanglement could not be transferred from momenta into spins via lorentz transformations .",
    "thus , the dynamical approach would be here more suitable .",
    "\\iii ) _ entangled state momentum - spin . _",
    "according to the previous theorem , the momentum - spin entanglement may be lowered , transferring part of the correlations to the spins , or increased , taking some part of the correlations from them . to our knowledge",
    ", there is not a similar result for the momentum , that is , whether the momentum entanglement can be preserved under boosts , or it suffers decoherence similarly to the spins , and part of it is transferred to the momentum - spin part .",
    "this is a very interesting question , which we will treat more deeply in future works ."
