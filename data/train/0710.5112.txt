    "recent cosmological studies using cmbr , supernovae , and other types of astronomical sources and phenomena have greatly improved our understanding of the recent expansion and acceleration history of the universe . whereas a consistent picture has emerged ( the `` concordance cosmology '' ) , in which the dynamics of the universe is currently dominated by a mysterious dark energy , its physical nature remains one of the key outstanding problems of physical science today . for a summary of developments in this field see ratra & vogeley ( 2007 ) .    aside from the cmbr , most experimental methods to study the expansion history of the universe , and thus its matter - energy contents , require samples of standardisable sources whose distances can be determined in a consistent way , e.g. , the supernovae of type ia .",
    "it is clear that both low and high redshift sources play an important role in these studies .",
    "low to moderate redshift sources allow us to define and probe the acceleration of the universe and the properties of the dark energy at the current epoch , whereas higher redshift sources allow us to probe the properties of the dark energy at earlier epochs and possible changes in its properties , which is perhaps the best path towards understanding its physical nature .",
    "confidence in luminosity and coordinate distance determinations , which are the foundation of the studies discussed here , is bolstered when more than one method yields the same results .",
    "like supernovae , powerful radio galaxies are observed out to redshifts greater than one , and their observable properties can be used to determine the coordinate distances to them , or equivalently the luminosity distances or distance moduli ( daly 1994 ) .",
    "it is thus interesting to study these sources and to determine whether cosmological results obtained with radio galaxies agree with those obtained with supernovae and other methods .",
    "in addition , the radio galaxy and supernova samples may be analyzed jointly to improve the determinations of the radio galaxy model parameters .    in this paper , eleven new radio galaxies",
    "are combined with a previously studied sample of nineteen sources , to yield a sample of thirty radio galaxies suitable for cosmological studies .",
    "this sample is analyzed here in three cosmological models .",
    "the first model allows for quintessence and non - relativistic matter in a spatially flat universe ; the second model allows for non - relativistic matter , a cosmological constant , and space curvature ; and the third model allows for a rolling scalar field in a spatially flat universe ( peebles & ratra 1988 ) .",
    "all of these models are based on the equations of general relativity , and rely upon this as the correct theory of gravity .",
    "the primary objectives are to obtain and compare constraints on model and cosmological parameters using different samples of type ia supernovae , extended radio galaxies , and a combined sample of supernovae and radio galaxies .",
    "similar results obtained with the radio galaxy and supernovae methods , which determine similar quantities over similar redshifts , will bolster our confidence in each method .",
    "this is because the methods rely upon measurements of entirely different quantities that are then applied using completely different astrophysical arguments , and thus provide independent measures of coordinate distances and cosmological parameters .",
    "results obtained from the combined sample allow strong constraints to be placed on the radio galaxy model parameter , which provides a direct link to and diagnostic of the physics of the energy extraction that produces the large - scale jets in these systems . finally ,",
    "if very similar best fit model parameters are obtained in different cosmological scenarios , tben these parameters can be used to determine the dimensionless coordinate distance to each source .",
    "the dimensionless coordinate distances thus obtained are then used for a separate study .",
    "in addition , the dimensionless coordinate distances to the radio galaxies can be used to define the distance modulus to each radio galaxy , which can be combined with those of supernovae to increase the sample sizes .",
    "the use of powerful extended radio galaxies as a cosmological tool is reviewed in section 2 .",
    "results obtained with radio galaxies , supernovae , and combined samples of radio galaxies and supernovae are presented in section 3 .",
    "determinations of distance moduli to radio galaxies are presented in section 4 .",
    "the main results and conclusions of the paper are summarized in section 5 .",
    "powerful radio sources are a cosmological population which can be observed out to very high redshifts , reaching beyond the practical limits of supernova studies .",
    "this makes them in principle a very interesting cosmological probe , provided that some distance - dependent quantity such as physical size can be standardized . in section 2 , we describe how the maximum size that a radio source will reach during its lifetime , @xmath7 , can be determined from radio observations .",
    "there are many different types of radio sources such as compact and extended radio sources , and radio galaxies and radio loud quasars .",
    "the use of radio sources for cosmological studies has a long and distinguished history including the works of rowan - robinson ( 1967 ) , longair & pooley ( 1969 ) , hoyle & burbidge ( 1970 ) , kellerman ( 1972 , 1993 ) , fanaroff & longair ( 1972 ) , kapahi ( 1972 , 1985 ) , rees ( 1972 ) , readhead & longair ( 1975 ) , longair ( 1976 ) , wall , pearson , & longair ( 1980 ) , laing , riley , & longair ( 1983 ) , condon ( 1984a , b ) , gopal - krishna & wiita ( 1987 ) , pelletier & roland ( 1989 ) , dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) , singal ( 1993 ) , daly ( 1994 ) , kayser ( 1995 ) , buchalter et al .",

    ", very powerful radio galaxies are used as a modified standard yardstick for cosmological studies .",
    "radio galaxies rather than radio loud quasars are selected for study so as to minimize projection effects ; in the standard unified model for radio galaxies and radio loud quasars , the sources are intrinsically the same , but radio galaxies lie close to the plane of the sky , and radio loud quasars are oriented along the line of sight to the observer .    the subset of classical double radio galaxies that are very powerful form a very homogeneous population . the source properties and structure",
    "are well described by the standard `` twin jet '' model ( e.g. blandford and rees 1974 ; scheuer 1974 ; begelman , blandford , and rees 1984 ; begelman & cioffi 1989 ; daly 1990 ; leahy 1991 ) .",

    "particles are re - accelerated to relativistic energies and produce synchrotron radiation in the presence of a local magnetic field .",
    "relativistic plasma flows from the radio hot spots , and , as time goes on , the location of the radio hot spot moves further from the central black hole leaving behind a `` radio bridge '' or `` radio lobe '' of relativistic material .",
    "the erg method considered here was proposed by daly ( 1994 ) , and explored and applied by guerra & daly ( 1998 ) , guerra , daly , & wan ( 2000 ) , daly & guerra ( 2002 ) , and podariu et al .",
    "it is described in detail in these papers , and is summarized briefly here .",
    "the method is based upon the following observations .",
    "( 1 ) the most powerful extended classical double radio galaxies , those with 178 mhz radio powers greater than about @xmath8 , have very regular radio bridge structure and shape ( e.g. leahy , muxlow , & stephens 1989 ) .",
    "this indicates that the sources are growing at a rate that is well into the supersonic regime , and that there is minimal backflow of material within the radio bridge ( leahy & williams 1984 ; alexander 1987 ; alexander & leahy 1987 ; leahy , muxlow , & stephens 1989 ) .",
    "thus , strong shock physics , which is clean and simple , can be applied to these systems .",
    "it also indicates that the velocity deduced by studying a source represents the average rate of growth of the source , that is , corrections for backflow of material within the bridge are negligible .",
    "( 2 ) the average size of this special class of powerful classical double radio galaxies at a given redshift @xmath9 has a small dispersion independent of the cosmological model , as illustrated in figure 8 of guerra , daly , & wan ( 2000 ) .",
    "this means that @xmath10 provides a measure of the maximum size that a given source at that redshift will reach during its lifetime .",
    "the parent population of radio galaxies considered for this study are from the complete sample of 3crr radio galaxies with 178 mhz radio powers greater than about @xmath8 .",
    "this leads to a sample of 70 radio galaxies ( guerra & daly 1998 ) .",
    "this parent population is used to define @xmath9 in several redshift bins , as described by gd98 .",
    "this measure of the mean or maximum size of a given source at similar redshift depends upon the cosmological model through the coordinate distance @xmath11 , since the size of a given source is @xmath12 .",
    "individual sources from this parent population are studied in detail to arrive at an independent measure of the average size of an individual source , @xmath13 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath14 , where @xmath2 is a model parameter to be determined . the ratio @xmath15 is approximately given by @xmath16 , so requiring that this ratio remain constant allows a determination of both @xmath2 and the cosmological parameters that determine @xmath11 to a particular source at redshift z. when the fits are run , the full dependence of each factor that enters into the ratio @xmath17 is , of course , included .",
    "the full equation for @xmath13 and the way that it was derived is described below ( see also daly 1990 , 1994 ; gd98 ; gdw00 ; dg02 ) .    each side of a source grows with an average velocity @xmath18 for a total time @xmath19 ,",
    "so a particular source will have an average size @xmath13 at the end of it s lifetime : @xmath20 .",
    "( note that the source velocities are independent of source size , suggesting that the velocity of a given source is roughly constant over the lifetime of that source , as described in detail by odea et al .",
    "the fact that the source sizes have a small dispersion at a given redshift suggests a cancelation between that factors that determine @xmath18 and those that determine @xmath19 .",
    "the equations of strong shock physics indicate that the overall velocity @xmath18 with which the source lengthens is @xmath21^{1/3}$ ] ( e.g. rawlings & saunders 1991 ; daly 1990 ) , where @xmath22 is the ambient gas density and @xmath23 is the radius of the cross sectional area perpendicular to the direction of growth of the source .",
    "thus , the average source size depends both of the intrinsic properties , @xmath3 and @xmath19 , of the agn that powers the outflow , and those that are extrinsic to the agn , @xmath22 and @xmath24 . separating the intrinsic from the extrinsic factors we have @xmath25 .",
    "as shown by daly ( 1994 ) , the extrinsic factors described by the second term have a very weak dependence on the coordinate distance @xmath11 to the source , and go approximately as @xmath26 .",
    "this parameter can be determined from observations by noting that @xmath27 ( e.g. de young 2002 ) , so @xmath28 ; here @xmath29 is the postshock pressure in the radio bridge @xmath30 and the parameter @xmath31 allows for offsets of the magnetic field strength @xmath32 from minimum energy conditions @xmath33 .",
    "re - arranging terms , we have @xmath34 to maintain the observed small dispersion in average source size @xmath9 , there must be a cancelation between the factors intrinsic to the agn that affect the source size , @xmath3 and @xmath19 .",
    "thus , it is proposed that the total lifetime of the outflow @xmath19 be written as a power - law in the beam power @xmath35 then , the average size a given source would have if it were observed over its entire lifetime is @xmath36 , or @xmath37 .",
    "thus , @xmath13 can be determined for an individual source ; it has one model parameter , @xmath2 , and depends upon the cosmological model through its depedence on @xmath11 .",
    "this parameterization of the total time the agn produces jets @xmath38 includes as a special case the relationship expected if the outflow is eddington limited . for an eddington limited system ,",
    "the lifetime is independent of the beam power , so a value of @xmath39 is expected , and we will be able to test whether the outflows are eddington limited .",
    "the implications of the value of @xmath2 for physics quite close to the agn are described by daly & guerra ( 2002 ) , and are discussed in more detail here in section 3.1 .",
    "the relationship @xmath38 fits quite nicely in standard magnetic braking models to power the outflows from agn ( e.g. blandford 1990 ; see section 3.1 ) .",
    "to write @xmath13 in terms of empirically determined quantities @xmath23 , @xmath18 , and @xmath29 , we note that @xmath40 and @xmath41 , so @xmath42 the dependence of @xmath13 on cosmological parameters enters through the dependence of each of the empirically determined quantities , @xmath23 , @xmath29 , and @xmath18 , on the coordinate distance , and is approximately given by @xmath14 daly ( 1994 ) .",
    "of course , when the full computation requiring that the ratio @xmath43 remain constant is carried out , the full dependence of each quantity @xmath23 , @xmath29 , and @xmath18 on the coordinate distance is included .",
    "here , we consider three standard models : a quintessence model in a spatially flat universe ; a lambda model that allows for non - zero space curvature , non - relativistic matter , and a cosmological constant ; and a rolling scalar field model in a spatially flat universe .",
    "the supernovae samples considered here are the 192 supernovae from davis et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , the 182 supernovae sample of riess et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and the 115 supernovae sample of astier et al .",
    "there is significant overlap between these samples ; for example , the davis et al .",
    "( 2007 ) sample includes the essence data of wood - vasey ( 2007 ) and the high redshift data of riess et al .",
    "different samples are studied to be able to compare results obtained with each .",
    "in addition , the model parameters determined for each sample can be applied to that sample to solve for the dimensionless coordinate distances to the supernovae in that sample .",
    "the 30 radio galaxies studied here include the eleven new radio galaxies presented by kharb et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , with details on individual source properties given by odea et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and the nineteen radio galaxies previously studied by guerra , daly , & wan ( 2000 ) and guerra & daly ( 2002 ) with the source 3c427.1 removed , as discussed by podariu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "the best fit parameters obtained in these models are listed shown in tables 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "the fits are done in the standard way for radio galaxies and supernovae separately . for the radio galaxies , we use the relationship @xmath44 where the cosmological model enters through the determination of the dimensionless coordinate distance @xmath45 to each source , which is simply related to the coordinate distance @xmath11 , @xmath46 , and we have the standard equations @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the expansion rate of the universe at a given redshift , and @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are observed quantities ( see daly & djorgovski 2003 and the appendix of guerra & daly 2002 ) .",
    "we minimize the difference between @xmath53 and a constant , @xmath54 , as described in detail by guerra & daly ( 1998 ) , to obtain the best fit values of @xmath2 , @xmath54 , and cosmological parameters .",
    "the ratio @xmath43 obtained for the best fit values of cosmological parameters and @xmath2 , and normalized to unity using the best fit value of @xmath54 is shown in figure 1 for the quintessence model .",
    "as in daly & guerra ( 2002 ) , an offset from minimum energy conditions of @xmath55 has been adopted , and the results are insensitive to the value of @xmath31 assumed ; similar results are obtained for @xmath56 . for the supernovae , we use the relationship @xmath57,\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is a constant to be fitted for each of the supernvae samples , and , as above , @xmath45 is the dimensionless coordinate distance , @xmath46 .",
    "we minimize the difference between the observed and predicted values of @xmath59 to obtain the best fit values for cosmological parameters and the constant @xmath58 .",
    "the parameter @xmath58 can be related to the effective hubble constant adopted by the supernovae group to obtain their values of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is in units of km / s / mpc , and c is in units of km / s .",
    "for example , a value of @xmath62 translates to a value of @xmath58 of about 43.15 .",
    "this approach is convenient since effective values of @xmath61 adopted and used in supernovae studies are often not included in publications and are often otherwise unavailable for the supernovae samples ; the approach used here by - passes the need to know the specific value of @xmath61 adopted and applied to a particular supernovae sample .",
    "the exception is the supernovae sample of astier et al .",
    "( 2006 ) who adopted a value of @xmath62 , corresponding to a value of @xmath63 ; the values we recover here ( see tables 1 , 2 , and 3 ) are consistent with the input value of astier et al . (",
    "once the best fit value of @xmath58 has been determined for a particular data set , this value and the observed value of @xmath59 can be substituted into equation ( 5 ) to solve for the dimensionless coordinate distance to the sources in that sample ; the values thus obtained are listed in daly et al .",
    "similarly , once the best fit values of the constants @xmath54 and @xmath2 have been obtained , equation ( 4 ) can be used to solve for the dimensionless coordinate distance y to each radio galaxy .",
    "then , equation ( 5 ) can be used to define an effective distance modulus @xmath59 to each radio galaxy so that the radio galaxies can be added to and analyzed with the supernovae samples .",
    "of course , in doing this , the best fit value of @xmath58 obtained for a particular supernovae sample is used to obtain values of @xmath59 for the radio galaxies that are to be added to that sample .    to obtain the best fit parameters for the joint fits ,",
    "the chi - square for each set of cosmological parameter and model parameter values is obtained by adding the chi - square obtained for the radio galaxies and supernovae , and finding the minimum chi - square of the joint fit .",
    "that is , we require that a single set of cosmological parameters and model parameters @xmath2 , @xmath54 , and @xmath58 describe both the radio galaxy and supernovae data sets simultaneously , and find the best fit values of parameters that minimizes this total chi - square . this is quite helpful in constraining the model parameter @xmath2 , as discussed below .",
    "each of the radio galaxy fits involve four parameters , two cosmological parameters and two model parameters ( @xmath54 and @xmath2 ) , or 26 degrees of freedom for 30 radio galaxies .",
    "the supernovae fits involve three parameters , two cosmological parameters and one model parameter ( @xmath58 ) , since the supernovae model parameter that relates the rate of decline of the light curve to the peak supernovae brightness is obtained separately .",
    "the joint supernovae and radio galaxy fits involve five parameters , two cosmological parameters and three model parameters ( @xmath58 , @xmath54 , and @xmath2 ) .",
    "the reduced @xmath64 for the best fit parameters is of order unity for radio galaxy sample alone , for most of the supernovae samples alone , and for the joint supernovae and radio galaxy fits , indicating that the model provides a good description of the data for the best fit parameters listed , though the reduced @xmath64 obtained for the 182 supernovae is a bit low .",
    "values of cosmological parameters obtained here are consistent with those obtained and published by each of the supernovae groups .",
    "in addition to the best fit values of cosmological parameters , we also list the best fit values of the model parameters , @xmath58 , @xmath54 , and @xmath2 , which are needed to solve for the dimensionless coordinate distance to each source .",
    "it is also interesting to compare best fit parameter values obtained with radio galaxies alone , supernovae alone , and the combined radio galaxy and supernovae samples .",
    "values of @xmath13 and the ratio @xmath43 are shown in fig .",
    "[ dstar ] for the best fit parameters obtained with the 30 radio galaxies alone in the quintessence model ( see table 2 ) , normalized using the best fit value of @xmath54 to have a value of unity .",

    "the ratio @xmath43 is independent of redshift , as predicted in the model .",
    "results obtained in a quintessence model assuming a spatially flat universe are shown in figures [ q30rgommw ] to [ q192snp30rgbw ] .",
    "results obtained with radio galaxies alone are overlayed on those obtained with the combined sample of supernovae and radio galaxies , which are quite similar to those obtained with supernovae alone .",
    "the radio galaxy results are consistent with but weaker than those obtained with supernovae alone ; radio galaxies alone indicate that the universe is accelerating today with about 90% confidence .",
    "the fact that consistent results are obtained with two completely independent methods applied to sources with similar redshifts suggests that systematic errors are not a major problem for either method .",
    "the value of @xmath65 obtained with radio galaxies alone is slightly larger than @xmath66 , the best fit values for the supernovae samples are slightly less than @xmath66 , and the best fit values for the combined samples are slightly larger than @xmath66 ; apparently the radio galaxies tend to pull the supernovae samples to slightly larger values of @xmath65 .",
    "again , the radio galaxy parameter @xmath2 has no covariance with cosmological parameters .",
    "results obtained in a lambda model with space curvature are shown in figures [ krgsnprgommoml ] to [ k192snp30rgbomk ] .",

    "( 2006 ) , wright ( 2006 ) , and wang & mukherjee ( 2007 ) , it is only by combining constraints obtained with different methods that tight constraints can be placed on space curvature ; as seen here , supernovae alone and radio galaxies plus supernovae , do not place tight constraints on space curvature .",
    "constraints on the radio galaxy model parameter @xmath2 obtained with with radio galaxies alone are overlayed on these figures , and are consistent with , though weaker than , those obtained with the full sample or with supernovae alone , suggesting that neither method is plagued by systematic errors at this level of accuracy .",
    "there is no covariance between the model parameter @xmath2 and cosmological parameters , confirming the results of daly & guerra ( 2002 ) .",
    "the implications of these constraints on @xmath2 are discussed in section 2.2 .",
    "results obtained in the rolling scalar field model of peebles & ratra ( 1988 ) are shown in figure [ a30rgp192snommalpha ] .",
    "these results are significantly tighter than those reported by samushia , chen , & ratra ( 2007 ) .",
    "the results obtained with the joint sample are strong , and suggest that @xmath1 is close to zero , that is , a cosmological constant provides a good description of the data .",
    "constraints on the radio galaxy model parameter @xmath2 indicate that there is little covariance between @xmath2 and cosmological parameters , and the value of @xmath2 is insensitive to the cosmological model . by combining the radio galaxy and supernovae data ,",
    "@xmath2 can be more tightly constrained .",
    "it is very interesting indeed that for the joint fits @xmath69 .",
    "this is a very special value of @xmath2 , as discussed by daly & guerra ( 2002 ) , and may explain why these sources provide such an accurate cosmology tool .",
    "the equations of blandford ( 1990 ) , @xmath70 for the beam power and @xmath71 , where @xmath32 is the magnetic field strength , @xmath72 is the spin angular momentum per unit mass , m is the gravitational radius , and m is the mass of the black hole that powers the outflow with beam power @xmath3 and total energy @xmath73 . these are combined with the empirically derived relationship @xmath74 suggested by daly ( 1994 ) to obtain the magnetic field strength @xmath75 ( daly & guerra 2002 ) .",
    "when @xmath68 , this simplifies to @xmath76 , so the magnetic field strength depends only upon the spin angular momentum per unit mass and the gravitational radius of the black hole , and is independent of the black hole mass @xmath77 .",
    "the fact that our empirically determined value of @xmath2 is very close to this special value is intriguing , and may suggest that some physical process is driving the magnetic field strength to some maximum or limiting value set by @xmath78 .",
    "when the field strength reaches this value , the energy is released in the form of the jets with beam power @xmath3 that remains roughly constant over the outflow lifetime @xmath19 releasing a total energy @xmath73 through the directed jets .",
    "a value of @xmath2 of 1.5 not only implies that @xmath76 ; this , in turn , implies that , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , or @xmath81 .",
    "the last three relationships follow directly from the definition of @xmath2 , @xmath38 and the relationship @xmath82 .",
    "a value of @xmath2 of 1.5 also implies that @xmath83 or @xmath84 .",
    "the relationship naively expected for an eddington limited system is @xmath85 , so @xmath86 , which only depends upon an efficiency factor when @xmath87 .",
    "thus , for an eddington limited system , @xmath19 is does not depend explicitly on @xmath3 , and would require a value of @xmath2 of zero , which is quite clearly ruled out for these systems .",
    "given that the most likely source of energy for these systems is spin energy of a rapidly rotating black hole , which could originate from the orbital energy of two black holes that merge , perhaps it is not surprising that the outflows have little to do with the eddington luminosity ( e.g. blandford 1990 ) .",
    "studies have shown a close relationship between the radio luminosity ( jet power ) and optical emission line luminosity ( agn ionizing luminosity ) ( baum & heckman 1989 ; rawlings & saunders 1991 ; xu , livio & baum 1999 ; willott et al 1999 ) .",
    "this may suggest a relationship between the jet lifetime of the source and the lifetime of the optically bright agn .",
    "it is possible that both the jet lifetime and the lifetime of the optically bright agn are not eddington - limited , but have a power - law relationship to the total energy and beam power .",
    "there are several ways to obtain the dimensionless coordinate distance @xmath45 to each source . for supernovae , one way to is apply the best fit value of the constant @xmath58 obtained for the sample , and apply it to the relation @xmath88 , with the uncertainty of @xmath45 given by @xmath89/5 $ ] , where @xmath90 is the uncertainty in the distance modulus @xmath59 to the source , which follows from equation ( 5 ) .",

    "the values of y listed in table 4 for 30 radio galaxies are obtained using the best fit values of @xmath54 and @xmath2 from the joint fits of 192 supernovae and 30 radio galaxies , where the average of the best fit values from tables 1 , 2 , and 3 for the relevant samples were used .",

    "there are two alternate ways to obtain the dimensionless coordinate distances to the supernovae and radio galaxies that do not require the use of the best fit model parameters @xmath58 , @xmath54 , and @xmath2 .",
    "these methods yield results very similar to those obtained using the best fit parameters .",
    "the alternate methods start with the values of @xmath59 for supernovae and @xmath43 for radio galaxies , obtain the luminosity distance or the coordinate distance @xmath97 to each source , which is in units of mpc , and then solve for the dimensionless coordinate distance using the equation @xmath98 by finding a way to determine @xmath61 that is appropriate for that sample , which often is not stated in the data papers .",
    "this value of @xmath61 that was input needs to be removed , and can be obtained by fitting the low redshift data to the hubble law , or by requiring that at zero redshift the function @xmath48 , described by daly & djorgovski ( 2003 ) ( see also daly et al .",

    "although the radio galaxy and supernovae methods are very different , there is good agreement between the dimensionless coordinate distances to sources at similar redshift .",
    "the supernovae distances rely on optical observations for rather short lived events , whereas the the radio galaxy distances rely on radio observations for sources that have lifetimes on the order of millions of years .",
    "the methods rely upon measurements of entirely different quantities that are then applied using completely different astrophysical arguments .",
    "thus , any systematic effects are likely to be quite different for the two types of sources .",

    "three supernovae samples are considered both separately and jointly with the radio galaxy sample and are analyzed in the context of three standard cosmological models ( see tables 1 , 2 , and 3 ) to determine cosmological parameters and the model parameter @xmath58 .",

    "the facts that the cosmological parameters obtained in specific models are consistent , and that the coordinate distances to sources at similar redshift are consistent suggests that systematic errors are not playing a major role in either method .    since nearly identical values of @xmath58 , @xmath54 , and @xmath2 are obtained in each cosmological model , they can be used to solve for the dimensionless coordinate distance to each source , @xmath45 .",

    "new constraints were obtained on the model parameter @xmath1 in the rolling scalar field model of peebles & ratra ( 1988 ) .",
    "these constraints are rather strong and indicate that @xmath1 is close to zero for reasonable values of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , a cosmological constant provides a good description of the data , and there is no indication that the energy density of the dark energy is changing with redshift .",
    "new constraints were obtained on the radio galaxy model parameter @xmath2 , suggesting values of @xmath2 close to 1.5 .",
    "this is interpreted in the context of a standard magnetic braking model of energy extraction from a rotating black hole ( e.g. blandford 1990 ) .",
    "this is a very special value of @xmath2 for which the braking magnetic field strength depends only upon the spin angular momentum per unit mass and the gravitational radius of the black hole .",
    "this suggests that when the magnetic field strength reaches this maximum or limiting value , the relativistic outflow is triggered . the fact that the magnetic field strength does not depend explicitly on the black hole mass for",
    "this special value of @xmath2 may explain why it is that this paricular type of radio source is able to provide a modified standard yardstick for cosmological studies .",
    "we have provided further evidence that radio galaxies can be used to determine coordinate distances to sources , and thus cosmological parameters through a standard angular diameter test .",
    "our comparative study shows that values of cosmological parameters obtained with radio galaxies are consistent with those obtained with supernovae .",
    "supernovae alone and radio galaxies alone both indicate that the universe is accelerating at the current epoch when these data are analyzed in specific models such as a a quintessence model in spatially flat universe , a lambda model in universe that allows for non - zero space curvature , and a rolling scalar field model in a spatially flat universe .",
    "all of these models rely upon the equations of general relativity , and the results obtained in these models would not be correct if general relativity is not the correct theory of gravity .",
    "these data are analyzed in a model - independent way that does not rely upon general relativity by daly et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who show that the supernovae data alone and the radio galaxy data alone indicate that the universe is accelerating at the current epoch independent of whether general relativity is the correct theory of gravity .",
