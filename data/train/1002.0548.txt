    "the microscopic mechanism that generates high temperature superconductivity in the cuprates continues to be controversial .",
    "one set of proposals is based on the analogy with heavy fermion metals where a superconducting dome is observed surrounding the quantum critical point ( qcp ) that arises as antiferromagnetism is suppressed by an external parameter such as pressure.@xcite in this case the pairing glue arises from the exchange of the soft longitudinal antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the vicinity of the qcp . in the cuprates doping plays the role of the external parameter and there are several proposals for the nature of the qcp that appears near optimal doping involving fluctuations in various order parameters e.g. nematic,@xcite d - density wave@xcite and orbital currents@xcite in addition to antiferromagnetism.@xcite a second set goes back to anderson s very early proposal that the strong singlet nearest neighbor correlations in the 2-dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnet generates pairing when doped holes are introduced .",
    "the advocates of this resonant valence bond ( rvb ) mechanism point to the strong asymmetry in the cuprate phase diagram between the physical behavior on the under- and overdoped sides of optimal doping and the qcp .",
    "this contrasts strongly with the symmetric dome observed in heavy fermions .",
    "further the highly anomalous physical properties that characterize the pseudogap phase at underdoping are associated with a short range spin liquid in the cleanest cuprate materials , e.g. yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 and hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath3 .",
    "nonetheless strong correlations and the absence of a broken translational symmetry in the pseudogap phase have proved to be formidable obstacles to constructing a comprehensive microscopic rvb theory for underdoped cuprates . for more details",
    "see several recent reviews.@xcite    several years ago we proposed a 2-dimensional array of weak coupled 2-leg hubbard ladders as an example of a model where occurs a truncation of the full fermi surface to pockets associated with hole or electron doping in a system without broken symmetry.@xcite subsequently this model led to a phenomenological ansatz for the propagator in underdoped cuprates starting from a renormalized mean field description of an undoped rvb spin liquid insulator.@xcite this phenomenological propagator has been recently used successfully to fit a range of experiments covering many anomalous properties of the pseudogap phase.@xcite in this paper we extend our earlier analysis to the case of an array of lightly doped 4-leg hubbard ladders with an onsite weak interaction .",
    "our goal is to construct a tractable 2-dimensional model with a partially truncated fermi surface in which d - wave pairing arises on the residual fermi surface through scattering in the cooper channel .",
    "earlier numerical renormalization group studies on the 2-dimensional hubbard model were interpreted as pointing towards a similar pairing mechanism.@xcite a key feature of the present model is the presence of a finite energy cooperon resonance in the pseudogap which is generated in association with the partial truncation of the fermi surface .",
    "d - wave pairing follows on the remnant fermi surface through the coupling to the cooperon .",
    "the properties of a single 4-leg hubbard ladder with open boundaries have been studied extensively in both the weak and strong coupling limits .",
    "we consider here the former with equal nearest neighbor hopping @xmath4 , along the legs and rungs . in this case",
    "the 4 bands split into two band pairs . the inner pair , @xmath5 , are standing waves on the rungs with wavevectors @xmath6 . at half filling the corresponding fermi wavevectors are @xmath7 and @xmath8 leading to a common fermi velocity , @xmath9 .",
    "the outer band pair , @xmath10 , have fermi wavevectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 and a smaller fermi velocity , @xmath13 .",
    "we obtain a band structure of four bands with energies @xmath14 where @xmath15 represents the dispersion along the ladder .",
    "the annihilation ( creation ) operators of electrons of the outer and inner bands , denoted as @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively , are @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the corresponding annihilation operator of an electron on the n - th leg of the ladder .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the excitations",
    "are then given by the locations of the poles in @xmath20 .",
    "these poles then imply that the excitations have the dispersion relation @xmath21 for sufficiently large @xmath22 a fermi surface forms ( found by solving @xmath23 ) consisting of electron and hole pockets .",
    "the type of pocket is determined by the sign of the effective hopping @xmath24 in our conventions a positive chemical potential favors hole pocket formation while disfavoring electron pockets .",
    "as @xmath25 grows beyond this minimal value , the pockets grow in size .",
    "we take the hopping such that @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the small parameter guaranteeing that the rpa is a good approximation .",
    "the dispersion relations of the quasi - particles near the hole pockets are @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .    in figure 3 are plotted the expected fermi pockets . on the l.h.s .",
    "of figure 3 are plotted the pockets found at zero chemical potential while on the r.h.s .",
    "are plotted the pockets for a chemical potential such that @xmath34 .",
    "for such a condition one obtains only hole pockets .",
    "we see that hole pockets occur in the vicinity of @xmath35 .",
    "the luttinger sum rule ( lsr ) for the single particle green s functions at the particle hole symmetric point takes the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the electron density .",
    "the corresponding luttinger surface of @xmath38 is defined as the loci of points in @xmath39-space where @xmath40 changes sign .",
    "these sign changes occur both at the poles and the zeros of @xmath41 . in order to apply the luttinger sum rule , we must take @xmath38 to be one of @xmath42 , i.e. we must apply the lsr to each band separately ( see eqn .",
    "( [ eiiiiii ] ) for the definition of @xmath42 ) .",
    "( we only apply the lsr to the electrons in the a - bands  the lsr also holds separately for electrons in the b - bands . )    at the particle - hole symmetric point , zeros are present in @xmath43 along the lines @xmath44 . in the absence of pockets",
    "the lsr is satisfied @xmath45 because of these zeros . and",
    "when @xmath22 becomes strong enough so that pockets form , the appearance of equally size electron and hole pockets on either side of @xmath46 ensure that the luttinger sum rule continues to hold .    introducing a finite chemical potential ( with @xmath47 )",
    "leaves the lsr violated as expressed in eqn .",
    "( [ eiiix ] ) .",
    "however it continues to hold in a modified form .",
    "because in a finite chemical potential , the ladder greens functions are given by @xmath48 , the lsr holds if we consider the sign changes the green s function undergoes not at @xmath49 but at @xmath50 .",
    "the residual interactions between the fermi pockets and the cooperons will lead to instabilities in the rpa solutions as temperature goes to zero .",

    "if we suppose that @xmath86 and @xmath22 are such that we only have hole pockets , the density of dopants is equal to @xmath87 if we denote the critical doping as @xmath88 where the a - cooperon becomes soft , we see that the transition temperature behaves as @xmath89 as @xmath90 approaches @xmath91 , that is to say , the transition temperature has a strong dependence on doping .",
    "it should be emphasized that this critical doping @xmath91 as defined above does not coincide with the optimal doping as typically understood .",
    "optimal doping can be thought of as the doping level associated with a change in the fermi surface topology .",
    "however in this understanding our model always remains in the underdoped regime since the quasiparticle fermi surfaces remain small as far as the interladder tunneling remains much smaller than the gap of the outer ( b ) band pair .",
    "we now consider the second scenario where @xmath92 .",
    "because @xmath93 is much larger than @xmath94 but smaller than @xmath95 , the effects of the interactions are wiped out in the a - bands while preserved in the b - bands . in particular",
    "a gapful cooperon still exists on the b - bands while the coupled a - bands appear as an anisotropic two dimensional fermi liquid .",
    "we can distinguish two parameter ranges in this scenario . at small dopings @xmath96 ,",
    "the b - cooperons remain gapped .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the two dimensional fermi liquid in the a - bands and the cooperons in the b - bands appears as @xmath97 where @xmath98 is given in eqn .",

    "( [ eiiixv ] ) .    as we no longer have pockets as in scenario 1 , but instead have an anisotropic 2d fermi liquid whose fermi surface consists of slightly deformed lines ( see figure 4 ) , the divergent with temperature behaviour of @xmath101 now takes the form @xmath102 because the a - quasi - particles are already gapless , a finite @xmath86 dopes the a - bands with doping @xmath103 . thus @xmath104 .",
    "if we denote the critical doping , @xmath105 , as the doping when the b - cooperon becomes soft ( i.e. @xmath106 ) and @xmath107 the corresponding doping of the a - bands , we can rewrite the form of the b - cooperon propagator , @xmath108 , as @xmath109 again we emphasize that the critical doping @xmath110 as defined above does not coincide with optimal doping  in this model we are always in the underdoped regime . for this range of doping",

    "the o(8 ) gross - neveu model governing the b - bands undergoes a crossover into a @xmath113 gross - neveu model .",
    "the b - cooperon propagator at @xmath114 becomes more singular . at the same time",
    "the velocity of the phase fluctuations becomes small and these fluctuations can be treated as slow modes .",
    "integrating over the nodal fermions one obtains the effective lagrangian for the phase fluctuations : @xmath115 where @xmath37 is a sum over ladders . as we have already noted the parameter @xmath116 is renormalized by the coulomb interaction to be slightly less than 1 .",
    "@xmath117 is more dramatically affected , taking the form @xmath118 so that it vanishes at @xmath119 ( or equivalently @xmath120 . as a side remark",
    "we note that there is an alternative way of presenting the effective hamiltonian . the above lagrangian ( eqn .",

    "the model presented above is a model of anisotropic spin-1/2 magnet on a 2d lattice with a staggered ( @xmath126 ) and uniform magnetic fields ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "this form of the hamiltonian has been proven to be very convenient for numerical calculations yielding promising results for the transport.@xcite    we again estimate the transition temperature using an rpa argument . at @xmath128 the doping of the entire system ( both the a and the b bands )",
    "is @xmath129 where @xmath130 is a constant and @xmath131 the detailed form of the cooperon propagator for a single chain at t=0 can be extracted from ref .",
    "however to obtain an estimate for @xmath132 , it is enough to use the finite temperature luttinger liquid expression for the cooperon propagator : @xmath133 where @xmath134 is a numerical constant . thus @xmath135 substituting the latter expression into rpa expressions for the pairing susceptibilities ( eqns .",
    "[ eiiixx ] ) we obtain an estimate for the critical temperature upon doping as follows : @xmath136 this dependence on the doping is much weaker than ( eqn .",
    "[ eiiixxvii ] ) .",
    "it holds in the region where phase fluctuations are already strong .",
    "thus we have obtained two regimes with different doping dependence of @xmath132 .",
    "the first one is the bcs - like with @xmath132 given by eqn .",
    "( [ eiiixxiii ] ) .",
    "it corresponds to lowest doping levels . the other regime , which in our model still describes a situation an anisotropic 1d - like fermi surface , is the regime with strong phase fluctuations .",
    "the mean field transition temperature in this regime is given by eqn .",
    "( [ eiiixxix ] ) . a further increase of doping presumably will lead to a change in the fermi surface topology and is not considered in this paper .",
    "phenomenological models based on coupled fermions and bosons similar to that derived here , have been proposed much earlier refs .",
    "( ) to describe the high temperature superconductors .",
    "the closest similarity are to the models proposed by geshkenbein , ioffe and larkin@xcite and by chubukov and tsvelik.@xcite both these phenomenological models examined fermi arcs centered on the nodal directions , coupled in the d - wave channel to cooperons associated with the antinodal regions . the model studied in ref .",
    "( ) had dispersionless cooperons which provided bcs - style coupling for the nodal quasiparticles .",
    "the result was a superconducting transition with weak fluctuations , similar to our @xmath137 case . in the model considered in ref .",
    "the cooperons possessed a one - dimensional dispersion which resulted in strong fluctuations as takes place in our case for @xmath112 .",
    "the authors of refs . considered the fluctuation regime above t@xmath138 when the cooperon energy is close to the chemical potential and drew comparisons to experiments in several underdoped cuprates .",
    "the key ingredients controlling superconductivity in the array of 4-leg hubbard ladders that we have considered in this letter , are a small residual fermi surface ( either pockets as in scenario i or arcs as in scenario ii ) , which is coupled in the d - wave cooper channel to a finite energy cooperon associated with the pseudogap responsible for the partial truncation of the fermi surface .",
    "the properties of a weak coupling 4-leg hubbard ladder near to half - filling are used to obtain these key ingredients .",
    "our goal is to derive a tractable model containing the important features that are relevant to high temperature superconductivity in the cuprates . in order to assess the relevance of our model to this goal ,",
    "clearly one must examine whether these key ingredients are present in a two dimensional hubbard model on a square lattice near half - filling .",
    "as we mentioned above , earlier numerical renormalization group studies on the 2-dimensional hubbard model were interpreted as pointing towards a similar pairing mechanism arising from enhanced pairing correlations present in a condensate that truncates the fermi surface in the antinodal regions .",
    "there are of course two reservations in these earlier works .",
    "firstly , the one loop approximation in the numerical renormalization group studies limits them to at most moderately strong onsite repulsive interactions .",
    "secondly , the renormalization group studies per se break down when the scattering vertices flow to strong coupling and the nature of the resulting low energy or low temperature effective action is a difficult problem which could only be surmised rather than explicitly derived .",
    "these two weaknesses make it imperative to examine the question whether these key ingredients are present also for strong coupling .",
    "the most reliable strong coupling calculations are exact diagonalization studies of strong coupling hamiltonians .",
    "the only limitation is the finite cluster size which currently is limited to small clusters containing up to 32 sites and 1,2 and 4 holes .",
    "leung and his collaborators refs . have reported a series of calculations for these clusters using the strong coupling t - j model and its extensions to include longer range hopping and interactions .",
    "we begin with a recap of the main conclusions of these calculations .",
    "the allowed set of * k*-points in a 32-site cluster with periodic boundary conditions contain both the four nodal ( @xmath139 ) and two antinodal points ( @xmath140 ) and ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "a single hole enters at a nodal point . for two holes",
    "there are two different states that are possible groundstates depending on the parameter values .",
    "for the plain t - j model with only nearest neighbour hopping a 2-hole bound pair state with d(@xmath142 ) symmetry is the groundstate on the 32-site cluster for j / t @xmath143 0.28 .",
    "the binding energy is quite small at j / t = 0.3 but grows with increasing j / t .",
    "an extrapolation from finite size clusters to the infinite lattice however suggests that the pair state is no longer the groundstate at j / t = 0.3 , but an excited state with an energy of approximately 0.17t.@xcite the inclusion of longer range interactions and hopping in the t - j model increases the energy of the pair state further and confirms the conclusion that for parameter values relevant to cuprates the groundstate of the cluster has two unbound holes in the nodal states.@xcite extending the calculations to the 32-site clusters with 4 holes , which corresponds to a doping of 1/8 , shows all 4 holes entering into nodal states with no signs of pairing correlations.@xcite in view of the prominent bound pair excited state for 2 holes , a low energy excited state with two of the holes in a bound state may also be expected here . however at present there is no information on this question to the best of our knowledge .",
    "leung and collaborators@xcite concluded from these calculations that at low densities holes entered the nodal regions , possibly in pockets , and as a result there was no evidence for d - wave pairing correlations in the groundstate for realistic values of the parameters in t - j models .",
    "however the analysis presented here suggests a more optimistic conclusion .",
    "first we note that the nodal points in the 32-site cluster are very special , because exactly at these points the coupling in a cooper channel to a d - wave cooperon vanishes by symmetry .",
    "thus if we interpret the d - wave pair excited state as evidence for a finite energy cooperon in the t - j model and its extensions , then as the occupied holes at finite doping move out from the exact nodal points , a d - wave pairing attraction is generated through the coupling to this cooperon , similar to the scenarios we discussed earlier .",
    "note an earlier study for two holes on smaller clusters by poilblanc and collaborators@xcite concluded in favor of the interpretation of the 2-hole bound state as a quasiparticle with charge 2e and spin 0 , which would be an actual carrier of charge under an applied electric field .",
    "in other words they concluded that a cooperon is present in the strong coupling t - j model at low doping .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the origin of the pairing in this state was published recently by maier et al.@xcite note the hole density in the case of 2 holes in a 32-site cluster is very low so that the superconducting order we are postulating should coexist with long range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "there is considerable evidence both numerical , in variational monte carlo calculations , and experimental , in favor of such coexistence , as discussed in the recent review by ogata and fukuyama.@xcite    we conclude that there is strong evidence that the pairing mechanism in the present model is not confined to weak coupling and ladder lattices , but will also operate in the strong coupling t - j model on a square lattice at low doping .",

    "<S> starting from an array of four - leg hubbard ladders weakly doped away from half - filling and weakly coupled by inter - ladder tunneling , we derive an effective low energy model which contains a partially truncated fermi surface and a well defined cooperon excitation formed by a bound pair of holes . </S>",
    "<S> an attractive interaction in the cooper channel is generated on the fermi surface through virtual scattering into the cooperon state . </S>",
    "<S> although the model is derived in the weak coupling limit of a four - leg ladder array , an examination of exact results on finite clusters for the strong coupling t - j model suggests the essential features are also present for a strong coupling hubbard model on a square lattice near half - filling . </S>"
