    "quantum entanglement is at the heart of quantum information theory and plays a key role in quantum information such as quantum teleportation @xcite , superdense coding @xcite , quantum key distribution @xcite , and telecoloning @xcite .",

    "the entangled coherent state ( ecs ) @xcite , or multipartite superposition of coherent states @xcite , is the most well  known example of entangled nonorthogonal states , along with the related entangled squeezed states @xcite and entangled su(2 ) and su(1,1 ) coherent states @xcite",

    "poissonian statistics , two - mode squeezing and violations of the cauchy  schwarz inequalities",
    "@xcite , as well as violating bell s inequality @xcite .",
    "although most attention has been devoted to the bipartite ecs , the multipartite case has been studied as well @xcite , but not to the extent we undertake here , namely generating such states , discussing their potential realization in ion traps and quantifying the degree of entanglement .",
    "such studies of the ecs are of interest beyond obtaining a fundamental understanding of nonorthogonal entangled states : such states can be employed in quantum information theory , and in quantum computing applications in particular @xcite .",
    "this particular application is relevant to our discussion of the multipartite entangled coherent state ( mecs ) , as it considers qubits encoded as two  dimensional center  of  mass ( com ) vibrational motion of two ions in an ion trap .",
    "these qubits are measured by swapping entanglement from the vibrational to the internal states of the ion @xcite .",
    "our analysis of the mecs could enable generalizations of such qubits to large entangled systems .    here",
    "we discuss the mecs and propose a scheme to generate such states via entanglement swapping , and we calculate the degree of entanglement by employing concurrence @xcite .",
    "we also compute the @xmath0-tangle @xcite to characterize the multipartite entanglement of the tripartite and even  number mecs .",
    "we consider a set of @xmath0 ions in a linear trap coupled together via the coulomb interaction .",
    "the collective motion of the ions is described by the dynamics of the normal modes , with  @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) the annihilation ( creation ) operator for the @xmath3 mode and @xmath4 the angular frequency of the @xmath3 mode , @xmath5 .",
    "the fundamental mode ( @xmath6 ) is the com mode with frequency @xmath7 , and the @xmath8 mode is the breathing mode with angular frequency @xmath9 .",
    "frequencies for higher - order normal modes can be calculated  @xcite .",
    "we propose a method for generating entangled coherent states of the normal phonon modes for the trapped ions .",
    "the ions behave as effective two - level systems , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 being the lower and upper states .",
    "unitary transformations that create superpositions of these two states are generated by the pauli raising and lowering operators @xmath12 and the inversion operator  @xmath13 . in @xmath14be@xmath15 ,",
    "the states @xmath10 and @xmath11 exist as two hyperfine sublevels with superpositions created via stimulated raman transitions  @xcite .",
    "the driving frequency between states @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be modified to excite one of the normal modes of oscillation .",
    "the normal mode can be excited by driving any one of the atoms , and , for a given atom @xmath16 , an effective interaction hamiltonian between the @xmath3 phonon mode and the @xmath17 ion is  @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the coupling constant . by choosing the duration , strength and frequency of the raman pulse appropriately , the coupling strength can be set to the same magnitude .",
    "thus we can consider a fixed coupling strength @xmath20 .",
    "this means that any ion can be coupled to any of the normal modes of oscillation , with the choice of mode and coupling strength determined by experimental parameters .",

    "although challenging , this coupling between ions and normal mode oscillations is possible .",
    "a judicious choice of initial state will lead , by hamiltonian evolution , to the mecs .",
    "we begin with the coherent state of the vibrational collective mode .",
    "if the phonon mode is initially in the ground state , the driving field is first configured to impart a displacement to the chosen normal mode .",
    "we can therefore assume that the @xmath3 normal mode has been prepared in a coherent state  @xmath22 , and the ion @xmath23 can be prepared in a superposition of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the initial state for the @xmath3 ion and the @xmath3 normal mode is prepared as @xmath26 .",
    "this state undergoes the hamiltonian evolution @xmath27  ( [ interaction ] ) to yield the time ",
    "dependent state ( in the interaction picture ) @xmath28 with @xmath29 a normalized unit of time , scaled to the coupling strength  @xmath20 .",
    "state  ( [ tau ] ) involves just one degree of freedom for the vibrational mode .",
    "we can consider two identical ions , ions  1 and  2 , each prepared in the superposition state @xmath10 and @xmath30 .",
    "let us also assume that the com mode and the breating mode have been prepared in identical coherent states , that is , with the same amplitude and phase ; the two - mode coherent state for these two normal modes oscillation is @xmath31 .",
    "we then couple ion  1 to the fundamental mode and ion  2 to the breathing mode by adjusting the appropriate parameters of the two raman beams , with beam  1 directed at ion  1 and beam  2 directed at ion  2 .",
    "moreover , the coupling strength  @xmath20 between ion  1 and the com mode is equal to the coupling strength between ion  2 and the breathing mode , with both interactions occurring simultaneously ; i.e. , the interaction hamiltonian is @xmath32 then the hamiltonian  ( [ interaction ] ) applies to the coupling between ion  1 and normal mode  1 and the coupling between ion  2 and normal mode  2 simultaneously . after a time  @xmath33 ,",

    "multipartite entanglement continues to be an important topic , and here we choose to study entanglement by certain well  accepted measures , which suffice for the mecs .    whereas we have shown how to generate the special case of even and odd mecss , in this section we consider the generalized balanced mecs for studying entanglement . by ` balanced '",
