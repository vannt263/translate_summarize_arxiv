    "enhanced mixing and transport are some of the most important properties of turbulent flows .",
    "these properties , sometimes characterized by a turbulent diffusivity , result in rapid homogenization of any mixture of different fluids , are used for many applications @xcite , and are also relevant in many atmospheric and oceanic flows @xcite . in",
    "many of these flows rotation is important , and it is widely accepted that turbulent mixing is affected by the presence of rotation @xcite .",
    "several studies consider the effect of rotation in the energy cascade . while the energy still undergoes a direct cascade , there is evidence that at moderate rotation rates a fraction of the energy can also undergo an inverse energy cascade , resulting in accumulation of energy at scales larger than the energy injection scale @xcite . nowadays",
    ", it is also known that the presence of rotation sets a preferential direction for the transfer of energy in spectral space , with the energy going towards modes with small parallel wavenumber ( where parallel is defined relative to the rotation axis ) , and resulting in a quasi - bidimensionalization of the flow @xcite .",
    "the energy flux is also reduced ( when compared with the homogeneous and isotropic case ) per virtue of the extra resonance ( or quasi - resonance ) condition that triads must fulfil for the coupling between modes to be effective @xcite .",
    "this results in a steeper energy spectrum than the one expected from kolmogorov phenomenology .",
    "the effect of helicity in rotating turbulence has received less attention , although it is known that helicity is relevant in many atmospheric processes , such as convective thunderstorms @xcite , and it is also known to be important in flows in blood vessels @xcite . for this latter case , results in @xcite indicate that helicity affects the energy transfer to smaller scales , making the energy spectrum even steeper than in the rotating non - helical case .",
    "a paradigmatical way to study turbulent mixing is to consider the advection and diffusion of a passive scalar by a turbulent velocity field .",
    "when the flow is turbulent , mixing and transport of a scalar quantity ( such as density of pollutants or aerosols ) is greatly enhanced .",
    "the turbulent diffusion of a passive scalar in two - point closures is related to the amplitude of the velocity turbulent fluctuations @xcite , and therefore it can be expected that changes in the scaling law followed by the energy spectrum should affect the dynamics of the passive scalar .",
    "the scaling ( including intermittency ) of passive scalars in isotropic and homogeneous turbulent flows was studied in @xcite , and later in @xcite .",
    "the kraichnan model @xcite allowed computation of all scaling exponents of the passive scalar for a random , delta - correlated in time velocity field .",
    "the predictions are in good agreement in results from numerical simulations @xcite , which obtained a joint cascade of energy and passive scalar variance following the same scaling law given by the kolmogorov spectrum @xcite , except for intermittency corrections .",
    "passive scalars in rotating turbulence have also been studied in numerical simulations , showing that the transport is affected by rotation and anisotropy @xcite .",
    "recent numerical studies or rotating turbulence @xcite show that passive scalar variance is transferred preferentially toward modes with small parallel wavenumbers ( i.e. , quasi - bidimensional modes ) , following an inertial range scaling consistent with the bidimentionalization of the flow .",
    "furthermore , the results show that perpendicular structure functions of the passive scalar have anomalous scaling consistent with the kraichnan model in a two dimensional ( 2d ) space , again indicating strong anisotropic mixing and transport of scalar quantities in rotating flows .",
    "experimental evidence of anomalous scaling of passive scalar structure functions in rotating flows was also observed in @xcite .",
    "stochastic models and two - point closures indicate that two - particle dispersion in rotating turbulent flows is highly anisotropic , with different dispersion in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the rotation axis @xcite , which can be related to the diffusion of passive scalars .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite also found that the turbulent diffusivity becomes anisotropic with rotation , reducing horizontal transport to a much lesser extend than vertical transport .",
    "as for the case of the effect of helicity in the transport and mixing of passive scalars , it was showed in @xcite that helicity affects passive scalar diffusivity in a turbulent flow .",
    "for isotropic and homogeneous turbulence , it is argued that the lack of reflectional symmetry ( related with a non zero value of the helicity ) produces a turbulent skew - diffusion perpendicular to the local mean scalar gradient .",
    "later , it was shown in @xcite using renormalization groups that while anomalous scaling of the passive scalar is not affected by helicity , the turbulent diffusion is . however , the effect of helicity in the transport of scalar quantities in rotating helical flows has not been considered .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study how helicity affects the spectrum of a passive scalar in a rotating turbulent flow .",
    "the spectrum and flux are studied in numerical simulations of turbulent flows with or without rotation , and with or without injection of helicity , to identify spectral indices in the inertial range of the direct energy and passive scalar cascades .",
    "the simulations are done with a parallel pseudospectral code with periodic boundary conditions @xcite , using a spatial resolution of @xmath0 grid points . forcing used for all fields",
    "is a superposition of random modes , delta - correlated in time , with controllable helicity injection , which in the simulations presented here is either zero or maximal .    scaling laws for energy and passive scalar spectra in the direction perpendicular to the rotation axis",
    "differ in rotating helical flows from the ones found in the non - helical case .",
    "a phenomenological argument that links the effects of helicity on the energy spectrum with the passive scalar spectrum is also presented .",
    "the data analized in the following section is obtained from direct numerical simulations of the incompressible navier - stokes equations for the velocity field @xmath1 together with the equation for the passive scalar @xmath2 , given by @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the pressure divided by the ( uniform ) mass density , @xmath7 is the kinematic viscosity , and @xmath8 is the scalar diffusivity . here",
    ", @xmath9 is an external force that drives the turbulence , @xmath10 is the source of the scalar field , and @xmath11 is the rotation .    the numerical code used to solve eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ns])-([eq : theta ] ) in a three dimensional domain of size @xmath12 with periodic boundary conditions is a second - order in time pseudospectral code , parallelized using the message passing interface ( mpi ) library and openmp @xcite . to solve the pressure , we take the divergence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ns ] ) , use the incompressibility condition ( [ eq : incompressible ] ) , and solve the resulting poisson equation . to evolve in time a runge - kutta method with low storage is used .",
    "the code uses the @xmath13-rule for dealiasing , and as a result the maximum resolved wave number is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the linear resolution .",
    "all simulations presented are well resolved , in the sense that the dissipation wave numbers @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( respectively for the kinetic energy and for the passive scalar ) are smaller than the maximum wave number @xmath18 at all times .",
    "dimensionless parameters used to control the simulations are the reynolds @xmath19 , the peclet @xmath20 , and the rossby @xmath21 numbers , respectively given by @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the root mean square velocity , and @xmath26 is the flow forcing scale defined as @xmath27 with @xmath28 the forcing wave number . for most of the simulations shown in the following section @xmath29 , and all runs have @xmath30 ( i.e. , @xmath31 ) .",
    "the forcing used for the velocity field as well as for the passive scalar is a superposition of fourier modes with random phases , delta - correlated in time , and the amount of helicity injected is controlled by correlating the velocity field components and the phases between fourier modes using the method described in @xcite .",
    "both the kinetic energy and the passive scalar variance were injected at the same wave number @xmath28 .",
    "one set of runs ( set a ) has external forcing applied at @xmath32 $ ] ( therefore @xmath33 , and the simulations have the largest possible separation of scales between the forcing wavenumber and the largest resolved wavenumber ) .",
    "another set of runs ( set b ) has forcing at @xmath34 $ ] ( then @xmath35 ) .",
    "finally , a third set of runs is forced at @xmath36 ( set c ) .",
    "for the last set of runs , the choice of @xmath36 results in a small separation of scales between the box size and the forcing scale , allowing for some of the energy to be transferred to larger scales in the presence of rotation ( although the separation of scales is not large enough to study the inverse cascade ) .",
    "this reduces the reynolds number and results in a narrower direct cascade inertial range , since the separation between the forcing and the dissipation scale is reduced .",
    "however , the incipient inverse transfer of energy that develops is important for the development of a dominant direct cascade of helicity when helicity is injected in the presence of rotation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the three sets of runs allow us to compare runs with similar rossby numbers ( albeit with different reynolds numbers ) while varying the amount of helicity .",
    "while the flows in set b are helical , the flows in sets a and c are non - helical ( more details of the runs in sets a and c can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "the simulations were performed as follows : first a simulation of the navier - stokes equation with @xmath37 was done , until a turbulent steady state was reached ( this requires an integration for approximately ten turnover times ) .",
    "then the passive scalar was injected , and the run was continued for other ten turnover times until a steady state for the passive scalar was reached ( these runs correspond to runs a1 , b1 , and c1 ) .",
    "finally , rotation was turned on .",
    "different values of @xmath38 were considered to have similar rossby numbers in all the runs with @xmath39 .",
    "all the runs with rotation in each set were started using as initial conditions for the velocity and the passive scalar the latest output of the runs without rotation in the same set ( runs a1 , b1 , or c1 respectivelly ) .",
    "each of the runs with rotation was continued for over twenty turnover times .",
    "parameters for all runs are listed in table  @xmath40 .",
    "parameters used in the simulations : @xmath28 is the forcing wavenumber , @xmath38 is the rotation angular velocity , @xmath21 is the rossby number , @xmath7 the kinematic viscosity , @xmath19 the reynolds number , @xmath25 the r.m.s . velocity in the turbulent steady state , and @xmath41 is the total helicity ( averaged in time ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as can be seen in table  @xmath42 , in all runs a substantial fraction of the energy , the passive scalar variance , and ( to a lesser extent ) the helicity , is in two - dimensional modes .",
    "helicity does not seem to affect the large - scale anisotropy .",
    "independently of the helicity in the flow the energy is more anisotropic at large scales than the passive scalar , as already found for non - helical rotating flows in @xcite .    to characterize small scale anisotropy ,",
    "the shebalin angles can be used @xcite . for the velocity field ,",
    "the shebalin angle is defined as @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the second order longitudinal structure functions of the velocity , respectively with spatial increments in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the axis of rotation .",
    "the angle @xmath46 gives a global measure of small scale anisotropy , with a value of @xmath47 corresponding to an isotropic flow , and larger values corresponding to more anisotropic flows .",
    "the definition is easily extended to the cases of the passive scalar and the helicity .",
    "table  2 shows the square tangent of the shebalin angles for the velocity field ( @xmath48 ) , for the passive scalar ( @xmath49 ) , and for the helicity ( @xmath50 ) . at the small scales ,",
    "the flows with helicity seem to develop stronger anisotropies for the passive scalar .",
    "these quantities give information only on the global anisotropy of the velocity field and of the passive scalar .",
    "there are other ways to quantify spectral anisotropy , that give detailed information of the distribution of energy in spectral space , and of the degree of anisotropy at different scales , as the axisymmetric spectrum @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of spectral anisotropy is left for future work .",
    "we presented preliminary results of numerical simulations of passive scalar advection and diffusion in rotating turbulent flows with and without helicity , in grids of @xmath52 points .    while in isotropic and homogeneous turbulence at moderate reynolds number the energy and the passive scalar variance follow kolmogorov scaling @xmath53 except for intermittency corrections , in the presence of rotation non - helical flows display a reduced perpendicular energy spectrum @xmath54 and a shallower reduced perpendicular spectrum @xmath55 for the passive scalar .    in the absence of rotation",
    ", the scaling of the energy and of the passive scalar remains the same independently of the level of helicity in the flow .",
    "in helical rotating flows , our simulations display a steeper energy spectrum compatible with @xmath56 , and a shallower passive scalar spectrum compatible with @xmath57 .",
    "these numerical results are consistent with a simple phenomenological model that predicts that if the energy spectrum has an inertial range of the form @xmath58 , then the passive scalar spectrum follows a power law @xmath59 with spectral index @xmath60",
    ".    finally , analysis of global measures of anisotropy indicate that the distribution of the passive scalar at small scales becomes more anisotropic in helical rotating flows ( in comparison with the results in non - helical rotating flows ) but it is largely unaffected at large scales .",
    "the results open new questions that will be addressed in future works .",
    "in particular , and as the spectral scaling of the passive scalar in rotating flows seems to be affected by helicity , one may ask : is intermittency and anomalous scaling of the passive scalar changed by helicity ? and",
    "how is the transport and mixing of the passive scalar affected ? while the former question can be answered by computing scaling exponents for rotating flows with and without helicity , the latter may require quantification of the turbulent transport in directions parallel and perpendicular to the axis of rotation .",
