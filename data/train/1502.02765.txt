    "we also give a different representation of the action with @xmath9 fixed points and no fixed lines found in al tabbaa et al .",
    "this allows us to show explicitly that both their action and our action can be distinct factorizations of a same non - symplectic automorphism of order @xmath10 .    to facilitate a diagonal reading of this article",

    "in  @xcite , it is shown that if a k3 surface of picard rank @xmath0 admits a non - symplectic automorphism @xmath4 of order @xmath1 with a fixed locus consisting of @xmath7 isolated points and @xmath8 fixed rational curve , then the picard lattice of the surface is isomorphic to @xmath6 . moreover , to illustrate another type of action ( see section  [ sec : appendix ] ) , the authors provide a model of such a surface : + define @xmath11 as the reducible planar sextic of equation @xmath12 the sextic consists of a line @xmath13 of equation @xmath14 and a quintic @xmath15 described by remaining factor in the above equation .",
    "the surface with picard lattice @xmath6 is the resolution of the double cover of the plane branched along @xmath11 .",
    "given the picard lattice , one can rebuild the incidence graph of smooth rational curves on a k3 surface .",

    "we represent this graph in figure  [ fig : resolution ] .",
    "part of the rational curves on the above surface are the exceptional curves that appear when blowing up the two @xmath16 and the @xmath17 singularities which lie at the intersection of @xmath13 and @xmath15 . given that these three configurations are disjoint",
    ", we can identify them unambiguously on the above graph ",
    "the vertices corresponding to these curves are colored in grey on the graph .",
    "furthermore , we can now identify @xmath13 on the graph : it is the lone curve which intersects all three singular configurations :    .,height=75 ]    our argument will rely heavily on the above graph .",
    "before we move on , remark that , as in figure  [ fig : fibrations ] , we can decompose the graph in different ways .",

    "* lemma 8.1 ) :    the action of a non - symplectic group on a configuration of rational curves is essentially determined by the action at a single point .    more concretely , the action at two transverse rational curves is constrained by the action on the volume form , and the action at two fixed points on a given curve is constrained by the nature of automorphisms of @xmath19 .",
    "in particular , for a primitive non - symplectic automorphism of order @xmath1 , in a chain of transverse rational curves , we get the action described in figure  [ fig : chain_lines ] .",
    "the annotation @xmath20 means that along that rational curve , around the point of intersection , the action looks locally like @xmath21 . in accordance with the legend in the introduction , we stylise this action as in figure  [",
    "fig : chain ] .",
    "note that we do not mark the local action at the intersection points .",
    "this can be obtained in a trice from the observation that along the fixed curve , marked in grey , the associated action is @xmath22 . + let us now analyze the situation when the fixed locus consists of @xmath18 rational curve and @xmath2 isolated points .",
    "[ lem : action ] there is , up to isometry , a unique order @xmath1 action on the @xmath23 configuration of rational curves that fixes @xmath18 rational curve and @xmath2 points .",

    "+ the automorphism either permutes or stabilizes the upper and lower part of the graph . since we need @xmath2 fixed points , the only possibility is that the upper and the lower branch are stable . from the symmetry of the graph , the curve coming from the resolution of the @xmath24 singularity is also stable .",
    "we have thus @xmath25 fixed points on @xmath13 , which means that the action is trivial on @xmath13 . using our rigidity philosophy",
    ", we can deduce the action on the whole graph .",
    "in particular , on the rational curve corresponding to the vertices of degree @xmath26 , the action has the form @xmath27 , i.e. it is of order @xmath28 .",
    "this implies that @xmath28 of the pairs of rational curves are permuted and @xmath18 is stable .",
    "we are now ready to describe an explicit model of the sought after automorphism .      from lemma  [ lem : action ]",
    "we see that the action preserves the @xmath29 @xmath30 fiber and hence the fibration described in figure  [ fig : sub3 ] .",
    "we also see that the action on the sections is of order @xmath28 , whence it is of the same order on the base .",
    "given that the fibration has a singular fiber of type @xmath29 and five fibers of type @xmath31 , we can use the discriminantal vanishing criteria , as found in miranda  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table iv.3.1 ) , to write down the associated model :    @xmath32    one sees directly that the action is primitive ( that is the induced action on @xmath33 is also of order @xmath1 ) from the explicit equation of the volume form : @xmath34 .",

    "one recognizes in the action on the fibers the composition of the map @xmath38 and of the affine representation of the translation by the @xmath39 torsion section @xmath40 : @xmath41 . since the two torsion section is fixed by the automorphism of order @xmath28 , these two actions commute .",
    "al tabbaa et al . , showed in their work how the fixed locus of @xmath42 and @xmath43 are of the same type ( i.e. @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) .",
    "what the weierstrass models above show is that it is possible for the two automorphisms to be different factorizations of the same automorphism of order @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath46 .    finally , let us make the following observation . through composition of @xmath4 and @xmath47",
    ", we obtain a nikulin involution ( i.e. a symplectic involution ) : @xmath48 and as we can see from our rigidity principle - by adding the weights of the respective actions at the germs around the fixed points - the action of @xmath49 fixes @xmath10 points ( see figure  [ fig : sym ] ) which is exactly the number predicted in v. nikulin s work ( see  @xcite ) ."
