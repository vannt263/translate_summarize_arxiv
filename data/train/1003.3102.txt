    "especially , the  momentum charge \"- to - mass ratio is restricted to @xmath188 . its geometry takes the form of a naked singularity , a black string with a null singularity , and a wormhole according to the value of @xmath189 .",
    "the geodesic motion are obtained by solving the hamilton - jacobi equation to get the radial equation of motion .",
    "we analyzed the effective potential and showed that the geodesic motion may have many qualitatively different behaviors from those of spacetimes without  momentum charge \" . especially , any geodesic can not arrive at @xmath47 . in order to arrive there , a particle needs to follow non - geodesic trajectory .",
    "in addition , there are stable circular ( or spiral ) null geodesics which are absent for schwarzschild geometry . the asymptotic region is allowed to particles with energy larger than @xmath190 .",
    "the existence condition is crucially dependent on @xmath70 .",
    "we explicitly presented some geodesic trajectories numerically . in this work",
    ", we divided the timelike geodesics into two groups in terms of the value of momentum charge .",
    "the particles move in three different geometries , spacetime with the naked singularity , with the black string , or with the wormhole geometry . in the analysis of the geodesic motions",
    ", one can usually read off the behaviors of the radial motions from the shape of the effective potential .",
    "we also study the lightlike geodesics ( @xmath74 ) for non - zero momentum along the @xmath18-direction .",
    "there exist stable circular motions , elliptic motions , hyperbolic motions , and the unusual behavior of a light ray bouncing off the potential barrier .",
    "in addition , we illustrated the orbit precession .",
    "the precession angle @xmath175 is @xmath176 at @xmath177 as expected .",
    "the numerical results show that it can be classified three groups in terms of the range of @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , it is indicated that we can identify the near horizon ( or singularity ) @xmath191 property of the solution by analyzing the angular momentum dependence of the precession angle since the precession angle shows distinct features for each geometry . in the case of a naked singularity , as the angular momentum increases ,",
    "the precession angle has a sharp peak which moves to the left as the  momentum charge \" increases . in the case of a black string",
    ", it has a smooth peak which moves to the right . in the case of a wormhole geometry",
    ", there is no peak and the angle continually increases and approaches to zero .    we would like to thank gungwon kang and hee il kim for their kind comments .",
