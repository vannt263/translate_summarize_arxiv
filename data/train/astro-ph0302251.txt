    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) consists of several phases .",

    "gas at slightly cooler temperatures ( @xmath12k ) is best traced by , which has a strong resonance doublet at 1032/1038 .",
    "the ion is generally assumed to trace collisionally - ionized gas , because photoionization by hot stars can not easily create such high ionization states in the diffuse ism ( e.g. , martin & bowyer 1990 ) .",
    "possible scenarios for the production of include the cooling of gas originally heated by supernova shocks and turbulent mixing of hot and cold gas at the surfaces of infalling high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) as they pass through the galactic corona .    to date , galactic @xmath101032 has been observed in emission along six sight lines with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _",
    "( dixon et al . 2001 ; shelton et al . 2001 ; shelton 2002a ; welsh et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the location of the emitting gas along these sight lines is generally unknown .",
    "@xcite note the narrow range of the observed intensities and suggest that the emission originates in the boundary of the local bubble .",
    "absorption - line measurements along about 100 sight lines @xcite reveal only a poor correlation of with other tracers of the ism , such as neutral and ionized hydrogen or soft x - ray ( sxr ) emission .",
    "@xcite conclude that the observed absorption is best explained by a patchy , absorbing disk with a scale height of about 2.3kpc .",
    "this thick disk corotates with the galactic plane and shows signs of outflow along about 20% of the observed sight lines .",
    "we have observed emission along two sight lines , only one of which allows reliable measurements using line profile fitting .",
    "we compare the physical parameters of the emission lines along this sight line with gaseous features observed at other wavelengths representing different phases of the ism to determine the location of the emitting gas and to investigate possible processes leading to the observed emission .",
    "our data sets ( program ids s4054801 and s4056101 , hereafter sl5 and sl6 , respectively ) were obtained with _",
    "fuse _ as background observations recorded in time - tag mode on 2002 january 1922 .",
    "our data are the first observations taken after the recovery of the satellite from a reaction wheel failure in december 2001 @xcite .",
    "we used the data obtained through the low - resolution ( lwrs ) aperture ( @xmath13 ) on detecter segment lif1a ( see @xcite and @xcite for a complete description of _ fuse _ and its on - orbit performance ) .",
    "the total exposure time of the 55 exposures of sl5 was 217ksec , with 95ksec recorded during orbital night .",
    "the eight exposures of sl6 yielded a total exposure time of 32ksec , with 13ksec during orbital night . during these observations ,",
    "the satellite was pointed near the orbital pole ( see table [ obs ] for observational data ) .",
    "the data were processed using the calfuse pipeline version 2.0.5 . only the first steps of the pipeline were executed , i.e. the data were screened for pulse height ( using limits 415 ) and corrected for doppler effects of the satellite s motion .",
    "bursts were also removed , but no walk or drift correction was applied .",
    "then the data were combined using the program ttag_combine .",
    "nearby airglow lines were used to determine the constant height of the extraction window .",
    "the wavelength calibration was derived from the position of the airglow lines .",
    "the resulting spectra for sight line sl5 are shown in figure [ spec ] .",
    "lines of @xmath21032,1038 and @xmath141037 are clearly seen in the sl5 data . due to the lower signal - to - noise ratio in the sl6 spectra",
    ", we will focus on the sl5 measurements in our analysis and refer only briefly to the sl6 data in section [ sl6 ] .",
    "we followed the arguments of @xcite to exclude terrestrial airglow , solar emission , and scattered light inside the satellite as other possible explanations for the observed emission lines",
    ". possible contamination ( 1@xmath15 upper limit ) of @xmath101032 by fluorescing h@xmath16 is less than 200lu ( lu = photonss@xmath5@xmath6sr@xmath5 ) for sl5 .",
    "an unknown feature appears in the day - plus - night spectra on the blue side of @xmath101032 but is absent in the night - only data .",
    "this feature is assumed to be airglow and has been seen in other data sets ( e.g. , shelton et al .",
    "2001 ) . due to its proximity to the @xmath101032 line",
    ", reliable measurements for could be obtained only from orbital night - time data .",
    "we measured the line fluxes for sl5 in two ways . in the photon - counting method",
    ", we summed the counts in the wavelength region occupied by the emission line and subtracted a constant continuum derived from the surrounding spectrum .",
    "one - sigma uncertainties were derived assuming gaussian statistics . in the second method",
    ", we used a line fitting algorithm , which determined the minimum @xmath17 for a range of synthetic line profiles using three free parameters for each line : central wavelength , line width ( fwhm ) , and peak intensity .",
    "the background was fitted by a straight line .",
    "we assumed that the emission line profiles were a convolution of a gaussian with the instrumental line spread function , which for filled lwrs slit emission is a 106kms@xmath5 wide flat - top profile .",
    "one - sigma uncertainties for each parameter were derived by varying the parameter and optimizing @xmath17 with the other parameters until the newly calculated @xmath17 had increased by 1 relative to the optimal solution @xcite .",
    "the results of both methods are given in table [ meas ] for the sl5 data .",
    "@xmath18 is the integrated intensity of the emission line , fwhm is the intrinsic line width , and @xmath19 is the central wavelength of the line .",
    "the derived velocity was converted to the local standard of rest ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the large uncertainties of @xmath18 for @xmath101038 and @xmath211037 in the @xmath17 method reflect the close proximity of these features : reducing the strength of one line was compensated by increasing the strength of the other , allowing a larger parameter space with only slow changes in @xmath17 .",
    "the extinction toward sl5 is approximately @xmath22 ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) , corresponding to an attenuation in the intensity of @xmath23% , if all of the reddening occurs in front of the emitting gas and the extinction parameterization of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) is assumed .",
    "the line ratio @xmath101032/@xmath101038 would approach 2 in optically thin gas , whereas in an optically thick medium the line ratio would approach 1 due to self - absorption .",
    "we derived a line ratio of @xmath24 ; the large uncertainty makes it impossible to constrain the optical depth of the emitting gas .",
    "our second sight line , sl6 , lies near sl5 and shows @xmath101032 emission in the day - plus - night spectrum .",
    "however , the emission line is only marginally detected in the night - only data and does not allow reliable measurements .",
    "the day - plus - night spectrum suggests an @xmath101032 intensity and velocity comparable to those measured in the sl5 data .",
    "figure [ 3d ] shows a schematic picture of the milky way .",
    "the positions of the four major spiral arms are adopted from @xcite .",
    "the model of hvc complex c is based on contours @xcite assuming a roughly constant thickness and @xmath25 height for complex c. no assumptions for the depth of complex c are made .",
    "all emission sight lines observed with _ fuse _ are shown . while the other sight lines have galactic latitudes of about 60@xmath26 or more ( except for sight line 2 , hereafter sl2 ) , sl5 has a latitude of only about 40@xmath26 , thus probing a different part of the milky way .",
    "sl5 intersects hvc complex c at its southern boundary . due to the large extinction of complex c , it is unlikely that the observed emission originates in gas beyond these hvcs , i.e.",
    "the location of complex c can be considered an upper limit on the distance to the emitting gas .",
    "a ( weak ) lower limit on the distance to complex c at @xmath27 is 6kpc @xcite .",
    "if the source of the emission were the surface of infalling clouds , we could expect emission at the same high velocities as measured in the leiden - dwingeloo survey in this direction .",
    "the hvc component is observed at @xmath28kms@xmath5 ( b. wakker 2002 , private communication ) .",
    "the sl5 data show no counterpart at this velocity .",
    "the 1@xmath15 upper limit for hvc is 300lu .",
    "we conclude that the observed emission does not come from infalling hvcs .",
    "the sl5 sight line passes @xmath293kpc above the perseus arm ( fig .",
    "the velocity of the perseus arm in the direction of sl5 ( @xmath0 ) is @xmath30kms@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "assuming corotation of associated gas at higher altitudes , the perseus arm velocity projected onto sight line sl5 at @xmath1 is @xmath31kms@xmath5 .",
    "this is consistent with the velocities observed in the sl5 spectrum and implies that the emitting gas has no velocity component perpendicular to the disk .",
    "figure [ wham ] shows a map of h@xmath3 emission from the wisconsin h - alpha mapper ( wham ) survey ( courtesy of m. haffner & g. madsen ) .",
    "a group of strong h@xmath3 filaments extends between @xmath32 and @xmath33 from the disk into the halo indicating an outflow of gas .",
    "sight line sl5 intersects an h@xmath3 filament above this region of strongest h@xmath3 emission .",
    "the wham spectra closest to our sl5 pointing show h@xmath3 emission at velocities ranging from @xmath34 to @xmath35kms@xmath5 ( m. haffner 2002 , private communication ) .",
    "the h@xmath3 filaments are most pronounced in the velocity range from @xmath36 to @xmath37kms@xmath5 at higher latitudes and @xmath37 to 0kms@xmath5 closer to the disk .",
    "this suggests that the outflow velocity decreases with @xmath25 in h@xmath3 .",
    "a simple galactic rotation model ( a corotating halo with @xmath38kms@xmath5 ) places gas with the observed velocity at @xmath39kpc and at a distance of @xmath40kpc from the sun along sight line sl5 in the neighborhood of the perseus arm h@xmath3 filaments . the similar velocities of these filaments , the perseus arm , and the emitting gas suggest that these three components are associated with each other : the shock - heated gas ejected by supernova explosions in the perseus arm and observed in sxr emission @xcite is cooling down or mixing with cooler gas and emitting the photons that we see .",
    "the emitting gas is on the verge of falling back to the disk , while the underlying outflow supplies new , hot gas .",
    "the measured intensities in the sl5 data ( @xmath4lu at 1032  and @xmath7lu at 1038 ) are lower than all previously measured emission line intensities ( 20003300 and 11002000lu , respectively ) .",
    "all the previous sight lines point toward high galactic latitudes inside what @xcite call the local interstellar chimney .",
    "only sl2 and sl5 ( both at @xmath41 ) appear to intersect the walls of the local bubble and the chimney ( see sfeir et al .",
    "1999 for contours ) . a new study by @xcite yields 2@xmath15 upper limits of 420lu ( 1032 ) and 540lu ( 1038 ) for emission originating in the local bubble , intensities much lower than any of the detections .",
    "this suggests that a significant fraction of the observed emission along sl2 and sl5 originates beyond the local bubble .",
    "the lower intensities in the sl5 data can be explained by more extinction due to the larger distance to the emitting region , if it in fact lies above the perseus arm as suggested above .",
    "although the intensities differ by a factor of about 2 between sl2 and sl5 , the sxr fluxes are similar ( @xmath42 and @xmath43countss@xmath5arcmin@xmath44 , respectively ; snowden et al .",
    "it is not clear whether most of the observed sxr emission comes from the same region as the emission .",
    "the correlations among the velocities of spiral arms , h@xmath3 filaments , and emitting gas that we find for sl5 are not present for any of the previously - observed emission sight lines .",
    "for example , the spiral arm and velocities along sl2 are consistent only if the emitting gas has an outflow velocity of @xmath45kms@xmath5 at @xmath46kpc .",
    "no h@xmath3 filaments or other signs of outflows were found near the previously - observed sight lines .",
    "( note : sl2 points toward a region not observed by the wham survey . )",
    "the corotating halo model would place the emitting gas @xmath47kpc above the plane ( sight lines 2 , 4a , 4b ) or even higher ( @xmath48kpc and @xmath49kpc for sight lines 1a and 1b ) ; sight line 3 yields positive velocities , whereas the model requires negative velocities .",
    "we therefore conclude that sl5 is the only sight line for which a reasonable and consistent explanation of the emission and its parameters can be found , and that sl5 and possibly sl6 probe halo gas that originated in the underlying spiral arm .",
    "we have observed galactic emission along two low - latitude sight lines , only one of which yields reliable measurements .",
    "based on the observed velocities of the emitting gas , the h@xmath3 filaments , and the underlying spiral arm , we conclude that the emission seen along sight line sl5 ( and probably sl6 ) originates in the halo about @xmath50kpc above the perseus arm .",
    "our observations are consistent with a galactic fountain scenario in which gas is heated and ejected by supernova explosions in the spiral arms , becomes boyant in the colder disk gas , and rises into the halo where it cools down and sooner or later falls back to the disk .",
    "we find no counterpart to the hvc component observed in .",
