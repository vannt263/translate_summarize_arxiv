    "the cargo transport by single cytoplasmic molecular motor has been widely studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "cargoes _ in vivo _ , however , are typically transported by several motors @xcite and sometimes even by different kinds motors @xcite . by far little",
    "has been known about the cooperativity of multiple motors during cargo transport , and it is still an important and open research subject . especially , cargo transport by multiple processive motors attracts much attention , since these motors can transport cargoes over long distances without unbinding from the track , which is convenient for experimental studies .",
    "actually , experimental and theoretical studies on such systems have been carried out in the last decade .",
    "these works investigated systems of fluid - like cargoes @xcite , or rigid or elastic cargoes @xcite , in the existence of external load force . in the cases of rigid or elastic cargo ,",
    "the cargo can induce strong coupling between motors , which is the focus of this article .",
    "recently , klumpp _",
    "proposed a transition rate model to study the cooperative cargo transport by processive motors @xcite . in their model ,",
    "motors are supposed to share the load force equally and have no other mutual interactions . by this treatment",
    ", the author concluded that the velocity of the cargo increases with the increasing motor number .",
    "theoretical analysis based on ratchet models also give the same results @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , experiments have shown that the cargo velocity is approximately independent of the number of motors pulling the cargo @xcite . very recently , shubeita _ et al .",
    "_ s experiment showed that increase of kinesin number leads to slightly reduced cargo velocity @xcite .",
    "this result is out of expectation and contradicts some theoretical results @xcite , but is supported by the simulation results @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical studies mentioned above fall into special cases since they are dependent on the modeling of single motor stepping . in this article",
    "we want to generally investigate the dependence of the velocity of multi - motor system on the number of motors pulling the cargo . for convenience ,",
    "we suppose the motors can not detach from the track .",
    "we proposed a steady state transition model of transporting cargo by @xmath0 motors .",
    "our calculation shows that the velocity of @xmath0 motors transport depends on the single motor s force - velocity(f - v ) relation , and especially in the case of low load , the velocity of multi - motor system may decrease with increasing motor number .",
    "this result provides a new explanation to ref .",
    "@xcite , and our work predicts a general behavior of multi - motor transport .",
    "( color online ) a cargo is transported by two motors a and b.,width=207 ]",
    "we first consider the situation of two motors ( a and b in fig .",
    "1 ) transporting a cargo . the equilibrium distance between a and b",
    "is denoted as @xmath1 .",
    "if motor a takes a forward step , the distance between a and b increases to produce a traction interaction between them @xcite , and the cargo is assumed to step forward with a distance @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the step size of the motor .",
    "this assumption is quite reasonable , e.g. , it has been shown experimentally that in the case of two kinesins transporting a microtube , the step size of cargo is 4 nm which is half of a single motor s step size @xcite .",
    "when motor b takes a forward step , resulting a repulsion interaction between the two motors , and the cargo also take a forward step of @xmath2 . here",
    "we focus mainly on the cases that the single motor performs unidirected stepping , since it s a good enough description of processive motors like kinesin",
    ".    states of the two - motor system can be specified by the `` effective distances '' @xmath4 , @xmath5 the real distance between the two motors .",
    "so each state of the system can be denoted by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 are integers . when motor a takes a forward step , the system transits from state @xmath8 to state @xmath9 . while motor b takes a forward step , the system transits from state @xmath6 to state @xmath10 .",
    "since the time for either motor performing the stepping motions is much shorter than the dwell time(e.g . , the 8-nm stepping motion of kinesin occurs on the microsecond timescale while the dwell time is always larger than millisecond @xcite .",
    "the 36-nm stepping motion of myosin - v occurs within a few millisecond , far less than the dwell timescale of second @xcite . ) , the two motors can never step forward simultaneously .",
    "therefore , the transitions between states can be expressed as @xmath11 the minus represents the distance between the two motors smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "the transition rates @xmath12 between states depend on the external load force and the cargo - mediated force between the two motors which will be discussed below .",
    "when stall force is reached on either motor , the system gets into the extremity states , @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "the cargo - mediated force exerted on either motor is quite intuitive , i.e. , when @xmath15 , motor b exerts a resistance force @xmath16 on motor a through the cargo , while motor a exerts an assistance force @xmath17 on motor b ; and it is contrary when @xmath18 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath16 is determined by the distance of the two motors and the stiffness of motor linkage which connects the motor heads to the cargo as shown in fig .",
    "1 . for different kinds of motor and cargo ,",
    "the stiffness of linkage are different . here",
    "we take kinesin as an example , and the methods can be extended to myosin - v directly , but it does not apply to dynein because of their complexity and unclear stepping behaviors @xcite .",
    "the linkage of kinesin exhibited an adequately linear behavior @xcite .",
    "in such cases , the internal force between the two motors can be easily expressed as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the linkage stiffness , and @xmath21 times @xmath3 is the effective distance between the two motors and each motor shares one half of the distance . when an external load @xmath22 is taken into account",
    ", the total force borne by each motor should be @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "since the force - velocity relation @xmath25 for single motor transport has been widely studied both experimentally and theoretically , one can easily know the step rates @xmath26 for either motor of the system .",
    "then we can get the transition rates @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , @xmath27    now we turn to the mean velocity of the two - motor system . denoting by @xmath28 the probability that the system is in state @xmath29 . here",
    "we are concerning the steady - state velocity of the system .",

    "so the average velocity of the cargo is then given by @xmath34}{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    defining @xmath35 .",
    "it s obvious that @xmath36 rigorously holds if the single motor f - v curve is purely concave , which is followed by two facts : ( 1 ) @xmath37 when the load @xmath22 is near zero , i.e , two - motor transport is slower than single motor transport at low load .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath38 when @xmath22 is large , i.e. , the two - motor transport is generally faster . while single motor f - v curve is purely convex , then @xmath39 rigorously holds , and two - motor transport is faster than single motor transport in the whole range of @xmath22",
    "most real single motor f - v curves , however , are usually a mixture of concave and convex regions , so one ca nt intuitively know the characteristics of the 2-motor f - v curve from the single motor f - v curve , but can still get some insight of @xmath40 when @xmath22 is near zero .",
    "roughly speaking , we have two typical categories of single motor f - v curve .",
    "_ category a _ : the single motor velocity is more sensitive to resisting load than to assisting load ( i.e. , the f - v region of assisting load is concave and much flatter than the region of mediate resisting load , as illustrated by fig . 2a . )",
    ", @xmath41 may usually hold .",
    "_ category b _ : the single motor velocity is more sensitive to assisting load than to resisting load ( as illustrated by fig .",
    "2b ) , @xmath42 holds .",
    "therefore , for real single motor f - v curves , we can obtain similar results as for purely concave and convex curves .",

    "noticing that the average velocity of the cargo is equal to the average velocity of either motor in the long time limit , so the cargo velocity can be expressed as @xmath46 where the transition rates are @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the internal force between motors for state @xmath49 .",
    "the last term of eq .",

    "transitions between states for n - motor system .",
    ", width=302 ]      for a general n - motor system , we can regard this system as the combination of a single motor and a ( @xmath57)-motor subsystem . in order to conveniently describe the model",
    ", we call this very single motor as motor a , and the ( @xmath57)-motor subsystem as `` motor '' b. in the case of linear - spring motor linkage , if one of the @xmath0 motors take a forward step , the n - motor system will progress @xmath58",
    ". so the step size of motor a is @xmath3 , while the step size of `` motor '' b is @xmath59 .",
    "similar to the two - motor system , we can express the states of the n - motor system by the effective distance between motor a and `` motor '' b. each state denoted as @xmath6 , where @xmath21 is the value of the effective distance between motor a and `` motor '' b divided by @xmath59 , i.e. @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the effective distance between motor a and `` motor '' b. when motor a takes a forward step , the n - motor system will transit from state @xmath6 to @xmath62 , while `` motor '' b takes a forward step , the system will convert from state @xmath6 to @xmath63 .",
    "transitions between the states are shown in fig .",
    "the minus states represent that the effective distance between a and b smaller than the equilibrium distance .",
    "if the effective distance between a and b is @xmath61 , then this distance shared by motor a is @xmath64 and shared by `` motor '' b is @xmath65 , so the internal force between a and b is @xmath66 .",
    "then the transition rates between the states can be given as @xmath67 where the definition @xmath68 is used .",
    "the steady state solution of the transition model shown in fig .",
    "3 can be obtained if @xmath25 is given and @xmath69 is known by the recursion of eq .",
    "( 9 ) and eq .",
    "( 10 - 11 ) given below .",
    "any one of the motors taking a forward step will make the system step forward @xmath58 .",
    "the average velocity of the n - motor system is then given by @xmath70 according to the network structure of fig .",
    "3 , we can get @xmath71 , the eq . ( 10 ) can also be expressed as @xmath72    if the number of motors @xmath0 is even , the above description can be greatly simplified . dividing these motors into two groups ,",
    "each group contain the same number of motors , @xmath73",
    ". then this n - motor system can be regarded as a two - big - motor system .",
    "if the f - v curve of the ( n/2)-motor system has already been known , we can easily obtain the f - v curve for the n - motor system by the same method of two - motor system .",
    "for convenience , we calculate the f - v curves for this situation and show the results in fig .",
    "2 .    fig .",
    "2a displays the f - v curves of multi - motor transport , as well as the single motor f - v curve of _ category a _ which is the most common case in many previous experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "the calculation shows the velocity of multi - motor system decreases with increasing motor number in the case of low load .",
    "this offers a possible explanation to a recent experimental observation @xcite .",
    "we also notice that some experiments conclude that the increase of motor number doest affect the transport velocity of cargoes @xcite .",
    "this may be a consequence of the fact that some f - v curves of single motor are not far from linear , so all @xmath74 are almost equal , i.e. , multi - motor transport is not significantly slower than single motor transport at low load .",
    "one can also consider the consequence of motor detachment .",
    "suppose @xmath75 motors adhering on a cargo . the number @xmath0 of binding motors is no longer constant but varies with time between zero and @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , the mean effective velocity of cargo transported by these @xmath75 motors can be expressed as weighted average of @xmath76 ( e.g , eq.(6 ) in @xcite ) , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the force - dependent equilibrium binding probability of @xmath0 motors .",
    "one can easily show that @xmath79 holds at low load if @xmath80 , by noticing that @xmath81 decreases with @xmath0 at low load as shown in fig .",
    "in this paper the f - v curve for cargo transport by multiple motors has been discussed .",
    "we focused on the linear - spring motor linkage case without considering the motor s backward steps .",
    "the results show that the f - v curves of multi - motor system depend on the f - v curve of single motor .",
    "novel insights are gained through our calculation , i.e. , at low load , the velocity of the multi - motor transport decreases with the increasing motor number if the single motor f - v curve belongs to _ category a _ , and increases if the single motor f - v curve belongs to _ category b_. our linear - spring motor linkage model can be extended to the nonlinear - spring motor linkage case and also the case of existence of backward steps .",
    "results of both the latter models are qualitatively consistent with the result of the former model .",
    "our results contradict to earlier results which predict multi - motor transport is faster than single motor transport @xcite .",
    "but the very recent experiment supports our results , which shows that increasing of motor number causes slight decrease of cargo velocity @xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite attributes the decreasing of cargo velocity to the detachment of motors from filament . from our results , even without motor detachment , the cargo velocity can still decrease with increasing motor number .",
    "in fact , the fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite also shows a slight decrease of cargo velocity with the increasing of motor numbers .",
    "there is another difference between our results and the results of ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the simulation results show that the multi - motor transport is slower than single motor transport in low load case , but if the motor number is larger than two , the cargo velocity will increase with the increasing of motor number .",
    "therefore , further experimental tests are needed , for example , hopefully by the method of ref . @xcite .",
