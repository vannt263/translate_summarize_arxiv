    "<S> @xcite . ]    in this letter we wish to point out two conclusions we have come to recently , apropos to the discussion above . </S>",
    "<S> first , similar to the effects found in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite-@xcite we have found that expected non - renormalizable gauge - kinetic operators in the gut theory can redeem minimal @xmath0 without requiring unnaturally large coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> second , we have computed the imprint of this effect on the gaugino masses , and found the resulting magnitudes of their relative shifts at the gut scale to be within the sensitivities of future and planned colliders .    </S>",
    "<S> minimal @xmath0 as a purely renormalizable supersymmetric theory was never viable because unification of down - quark yukawa couplings with lepton yukawa couplings does not work for the first two generations . </S>",
    "<S> it has been understood for a very long time now that non - trivial non - renormalizable operators ( nros ) are needed . </S>",
    "<S> this is no extraordinary burden on the theory , however , as the planck scale is not far from the gut scale and nros induced by supergravity are expected and of sufficient size to implement the flavor gymnastics required to reproduce the masses and mixings of the quarks and leptons .    </S>",
    "<S> it has also been known for some time that nros can dramatically affect gauge coupling unification and gaugino masses  @xcite-@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these operators should not necessarily be viewed as sources of gut - scale obfuscation , but rather as potential saviors for a theory that struggles to survive without them . </S>",
    "<S> minimal @xmath0 is one such theory .    </S>",
    "<S> we can write the gauge - kinetic function of minimal @xmath0 as d^2[gkf ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 contains the effective singlet supersymmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 gauge coupling is @xmath15 and the universal contribution to the masses of all gauginos is @xmath16 .    this second term of eq .  </S>",

    "<S> . not only is the operator expected , but it is guaranteed to contribute to the gauge coupling corrections because the adjoint higgs must get a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the form = v _ diag ( , , , -1,-1 ) to break @xmath0 to @xmath17 at the gut scale . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical value of @xmath18 depends on details of the couplings but should be around the gut scale of @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> the relationships between the gut scale gauge coupling @xmath15 and the low - scale gauge couplings @xmath20 of the mssm effective theory are = + ^g_i(q)+c_i[gcc ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the gauge groups @xmath23 respectively . here </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the gut normalized @xmath24 gauge coupling @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath26 functions are the threshold corrections due to heavy gut states ; @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are @xmath30 function coefficient of a heavy particle and its mass , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> we will be working with this equation near the gut scale , @xmath31 , and so the couplings @xmath20 are assumed to be those that have been measured at the weak scale , renormalized by weak - scale supersymmetric particle threshold corrections and run up to the high scale @xmath32 using two - loop renormalization group evolution  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our equations are always in the @xmath33 scheme .    </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see how the triplet higgsino mass is severely constrained by unification requirements . </S>",
    "<S> let s consider the @xmath34 case for a moment . </S>",
    "<S> there exists a linear combination of @xmath35 that depends only on @xmath36 and not on the other unknown gut scale states  @xcite : -+- = . </S>",
    "<S> [ gi combo ] this equation is true for any scale @xmath32 at the one - loop level , but it is most instructive to evaluate it at the unification scale @xmath37 , which we define to be the place where @xmath38 , - = . </S>",
    "<S> [ gu combo ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath37 depends mildly on the low - scale superpartner masses , but it is always within the range 110 ^ 16.7ex_u.7ex210 ^ 16for superpartner masses at the tev scale and below .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well known  @xcite that @xmath39 , albeit by less than 1% . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , this implies that the lhs of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gu combo ] ) is necessarily negative . </S>",
    "<S> we see that @xmath40 is required for the rhs to be negative and successful gauge coupling unification to occur . </S>",
    "<S> but this is in conflict with the proton decay requirement that @xmath41 .    </S>",
    "<S> however , non - zero @xmath42 can easily and naturally enable a large @xmath36 . because of an interesting and non - trivial relation between @xmath43 and a @xmath30-function coefficients @xmath44 of @xmath11 ( @xmath45 ) , an inclusion of non - zero @xmath46 only affects the unified gauge coupling and color - triplet higgsino mass @xmath36 as can be seen from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gcc ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , if we define the effective colored higgsino mass to be @xmath47 , the above constraints discussion in the case with @xmath34 applies to @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , even though the effective colored higgsino mass @xmath48 is severely constrained by gauge coupling unification ( eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mhc_gcc_limit ] ) ) , the real colored higgsino mass @xmath49 can be large enough to satisfy the proton decay limit eq .  </S>",

    "<S> we remark also that the unified coupling governing dimension six proton decay operators is reduced by @xmath51 , thus increasing the proton lifetime .    </S>",

    "<S> [ mc ] , where the relationship between @xmath46 and @xmath36 for exact unification is established . </S>",
    "<S> each band is for a given assumed superpartner spectrum , and the width of the band is primarily due to the current uncertainty in @xmath52 which we take to be @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> we see from the numerical results ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mc ] ) that if we ignore the adjoint - higgs nro correction ( @xmath34 ) the triplet higgsino mass needed for unification is less than about @xmath19 , even for all superpartner masses up to @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> however , if @xmath55 we find that @xmath36 can be comfortably greater than @xmath56 , thus enabling precision gauge coupling unification and a sufficiently long - lived proton . </S>",
    "<S> this successful region of parameter space requires @xmath57 , which is consistent with the expectation @xmath58 . </S>",

    "<S> here we define @xmath60 ( universal scalar mass ) and @xmath61 ( universal gaugino mass ) at the gut scale , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 at the weak scale without imposing a radiative electro - weak symmetry breaking condition . </S>",
    "<S> one expects @xmath64 , and thus @xmath65 can be naturally achieved as is required by proton decay constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the width of each band is primarily due to the current uncertainty in @xmath52.,width=491 ]    at present there is no known way to experimentally verify minimal @xmath0 , or any other gut for that matter . </S>",

    "<S> it may appear unlikely that any shifting around of @xmath46 and @xmath36 at the high - scale to obtain compatibility with low - scale gauge coupling measurements would have any discernible experimental implications . </S>",
    "<S> however , precision gaugino mass measurements do provide a interesting probe of the framework .    </S>",
    "<S> one crucial realization is that the @xmath9 representation vev is not just a scalar vev , but a vev in superspace when we take into account the entire chiral superfield , ( v_+f_^2 ) diag ( , , , -1,-1 ) just as the @xmath66 and @xmath67 higgs superfields of the mssm pick up auxiliary field vevs when their scalar components condense , the @xmath68 superfield obtains a superspace vev .    </S>",

    "<S> [ d12_d32 ] we use @xmath74 and @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> these numerical values change slightly with the superpartner masses , but the qualitative features of the results stay the same . furthermore , as we shall emphasize , these quantities are unambiguously calculable given knowledge of the low - energy superpartner spectrum .    the overall scale of the gaugino masses can not be predicted ; however , there are some interesting correlations among ratios of the gauginos . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to define the quantities _ 1 - 2=  and   _ 3 - 2=. the @xmath76 s are defined at the @xmath77 unification scale @xmath37 , and are unambiguously measurable given knowledge of the superpartner spectrum at the low scale and of course the beta functions of the mssm up to the @xmath37 scale . </S>",
    "<S> uncertainties in the extracted @xmath76 s from measurements would spring from uncertainties in superpartner masses and couplings , uncertainties in the all - orders beta functions in the renormalization group evolution , and uncertainties in the measured gauge couplings , most especially @xmath78 .    </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 extracted from measurement will have discriminating power in the gut scale parameter space of minimal supersymmetric @xmath0 . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> , we are testing the theory . </S>",
    "<S> there are four parameters of the gut theory that are affecting the ratios of the gaugino mass values at @xmath37 , ,   a_/ ,   b_/ ,   b_5/. fitting four parameters to the two @xmath76 observables does not sound particularly enlightening , but there are a few interesting observations one can make about the underlying gut model and the @xmath76 values .    </S>",
    "<S> for example , in minimal @xmath0 there is a relationship between @xmath81 terms and @xmath82 terms that must be satisfied in order to solve the doublet - triplet splitting problem , a_- b_=a_-b_5 . </S>",
    "<S> [ ab terms ] one solution to realize this relationship is the hypothesis of universal @xmath81-terms @xmath83 and @xmath82-terms @xmath84 . under this hypothesis , </S>",
    "<S> possible regions of @xmath79 and @xmath80 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ d12_d32 ] with @xmath85 and @xmath86 assuming @xmath87 and @xmath88 . as one can see from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ d12_d32 ] , a relative sign between @xmath79 and @xmath80 tends toward negative in the @xmath34 case , and toward positive in the non - zero @xmath46 cases . </S>",
    "<S> also the @xmath76 corrections can be larger as @xmath46 gets larger . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there is an interesting opportunity to unveil a crucial role of the non - zero @xmath46 effect if we achieve precise enough determinations of gaugino masses at @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath46 effect on gaugino masses is an important one . without it , the corrections to the gaugino mass ratios at the high scale fall along the rather narrow @xmath89 band in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ d12_d32 ] . </S>",
    "<S> non - zero @xmath46 means , for example , that both @xmath79 and @xmath80 can be large and negative which is otherwise impossible .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two interesting limits to consider to illustrate how patterns of fundamental parameters can alter expectations of gaugino masses . </S>",
    "<S> one limit is when @xmath90 and the only corrections to the gaugino masses come from @xmath91 corrections . in that case , both @xmath79 and @xmath80 are approximately @xmath92 , a negative but small mismatch of gaugino masses at the high scale . measuring these parameters to the sub - percent level </S>",
    "<S> is challenging even for a linear collider . </S>",
    "<S> we will outline measurement prospects below . in any event </S>",
    "<S> , it would perhaps be easier to rule out @xmath93 than confirm it by experiment . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if both @xmath76 s are positive or one has a magnitude much bigger than @xmath94 , we will know that minimal @xmath0 with negligible @xmath81 and @xmath82 terms is not supported by the data .    </S>",
    "<S> the other interesting limit that eliminates the @xmath46 effect on the gaugino mass ratios is when @xmath95 , but @xmath81 and @xmath82 are non - zero . since the @xmath46 contribution always is prefactored by @xmath96 , the @xmath46 value has no effect on the gaugino mass ratios in this case . </S>",
    "<S> thus , variations of @xmath97 over its full range yields a line going through the origin that connects the two multi - line intersections in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ d12_d32 ] . </S>",
    "<S> that range is characterized by -4% .7ex_1 - 2.7ex2%  and   -6% .7ex_2 - 3.7ex3% . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , any deviations beyond 10% would be firm evidence against this scenario , and even @xmath98 effects that deviate from the @xmath99 line would disaffirm the hypothesis .     </S>",

    "<S> very precise measurements of all superpartner masses and couplings are crucial </S>",
    "<S> . given precise measurements of these quantities at the low scale , the scale @xmath37 can be derived unambiguously . </S>",
    "<S> the two - loop evaluation of the gaugino masses up to this scale is a well - defined prescription  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> blair _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have shown that a high - energy linear collider is capable of measuring gaugino masses well enough at the low - scale that a @xmath79 measurements at even the percent level can be discerned . </S>",
    "<S> measuring @xmath80 down to this accuracy is not as easy , but it appears possible that even @xmath103 few percent could be established given careful analysis of lhc and linear collider data . </S>",
    "<S> the studies of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite are very encouraging in that we believe they show that a linear collider along with the lhc could make a significant impact on our ability to draw interesting distinctions between gut scale theories .    in conclusion , we have seen that no analysis of gut gauge coupling unification can be complete without taking into account nro corrections to the gauge kinetic function , and the expected size of these corrections from naive dimensional analysis suggests that they can play a decisive role in whether or not a theory is even viable . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case for minimal supersymmetric @xmath0 , where the adjoint - higgs nro corrections can save the theory . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have shown that there are experimental consequences at the low scale , and have illustrated how careful measurements of the gaugino mass spectrum can discern ideas , such as whether minimal @xmath0 with the universal @xmath81-term and @xmath82-term is viable . </S>",
    "<S> further theoretical and experimental ideas would then be required to more definitively establish the theory or falsify it . </S>"
