    "finding the highest redshift objects is placing constraints on the theory of baryonic physics to form luminous objects in the universe .",
    "the latest survey with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) has provided a number of candidates of @xmath6 galaxies by the so - called drop - out technique ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . however , the redshifts of these lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) are not yet confirmed through spectroscopy .",
    "since the rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) continuum of the lbgs are too faint ( @xmath7 ab ) to be detected with current spectrograph , it was often assumed that ly@xmath8 emission is the best tool to confirm the redshift .",
    "yet , attempts to detect ly@xmath8 for @xmath0 lbgs failed @xcite , indicating that ly@xmath8 was substantially weakened by the intergalactic neutral hydrogen before the completion of the cosmic reionization .",
    "otherwise the lbgs were just interlopers @xcite .",
    "if ly@xmath8 emission at @xmath0 is so weakened that we can not detect , we should consider other emission lines to confirm their redshift .",
    "considering the superb ability of the atacama large millimeter / sub - millimeter array ( alma ) , the rest - frame far - infrared ( fir ) emission lines may be attractive . for example , the [ c ii ] 158 @xmath1 m line is very luminous and often detected from high-@xmath2 sources including @xmath9 qsos @xcite .",
    "however , the line is not detected from @xmath9 ly@xmath8 emitters @xcite , suggesting a different situation of the interstellar medium in these high-@xmath2 low - metallicity galaxies .",
    "in addition , the [ c ii ] line at @xmath10 , where the highest-@xmath2 lbgs reside , is redshifted into the alma band 5 not available soon .",
    "the fir [ o iii ] lines at 52 and 88 @xmath1 m are known as prominent lines from h ii regions since 1970s @xcite , while the lines have been rarely discussed in the high-@xmath2 context so far because of the lack of suitable instruments .",
    "the first fir [ o iii ] detection from cosmologically distant sources is reported by @xcite from two @xmath11 and 4 gravitationally lensed dusty agn / starburst galaxies . in the local universe , the infrared space observatory ( iso ) and the japanese infrared satellite akari detected the lines from galactic h ii regions @xcite , from a giant h ii region , 30 doradus , in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) @xcite , and from many nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "interestingly , recent _ herschel _ observations have revealed that the [ o iii ] 88 @xmath1 m line is often stronger than the [ c ii ] line in low - metallicity nearby dwarf galaxies ( figure  5 of madden et al .",

    "last but not least , the [ o iii ] 88 @xmath1 m line at @xmath12 falls into the alma band 7 in operation .    in section 2 , we construct a fir nebular emission model in high-@xmath2 universe based on our cosmological simulation and the photoionization code cloudy , followed by the expected fir line fluxes presented in section 3 . finally , we discuss the feasibility for detecting the lines from @xmath0 galaxies with alma in section 4 .    throughout this letter",

    "given that the same lyc also ionizes the metal atoms , the similar assumption for metal forbidden lines as equation ( 1 ) would be reasonable .",

    "we avoid modelling photodissociation regions and molecular clouds surrounding h ii regions because it requires more complex physical and chemical processes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and may cause a large uncertainty , although it enables us to predict some strong fir lines such as [ c ii ] 158 @xmath1 m and [ o i ] 63 @xmath1 m .",

    "this is wide enough to probe the redshift range expected by photometry .",
    "another caveat is that we have only a single line even if we detect .",
    "thus , we have to rely on a photometric redshift method to conclude the detected line to be the [ o iii ] 88 @xmath1 m line .",
    "fortunately , we can go to detect other weaker lines such as [ o iii ] 52 @xmath1 m and [ n iii ] 57 @xmath1 m as well as [ o i ] 63 @xmath1 m and [ c ii ] 158 @xmath1 m because we already know the exact redshift and can invest much time for one integration . the ratios of these fir lines are very useful for diagnostics of the chemical evolution and ionizing sources in highest-@xmath2 galaxies .",
