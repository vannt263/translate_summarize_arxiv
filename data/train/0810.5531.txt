    "the theoretical description of multilayer adsorption is a long - standing important problem in surface science that does not have a general solution . @xcite",
    "mainly this is due to the fact that the structure of the different layers differs from that in contact with the solid surface ( first layer ) . at high coverage ( multilayer region )",
    ", it is expected that the adsorption process is well described by the slab theory of frenkel , halsey and hill .",
    "@xcite in this approach it is assumed that the higher layers retain the structure of the bulk liquid , and only its free energy changes gradually as one goes away from the solid surface . on the other hand , at low coverage , it is more appropriate to use the brunauer - emmet - teller s ( bet ) isotherm , @xcite where the crystal - like structure of the surface is considered . in the bet theory",
    "it is assumed that the molecules are localized in sites and that the adsorption in the first layer is different from the remaining ones .",
    "the bet equation is one of the most widely used isotherms .",
    "the approach discards such things as the polyatomic character of the adsorbate , the interaction between the admolecules and the surface heterogeneities .",
    "then , with the purpose of including a more complex situation , numerous generalizations of the bet theory have been proposed .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , the simplicity of the bet isotherm has made it very popular for practical purposes .",
    "in fact , by fitting an experimental isotherm with the bet equation , in many cases it is possible to predict the monolayer volume ( or monolayer capacity ) of the solid surface with an error not bigger than the @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite this surprising result is attributed to compensation effects arisen as consequence of having carried out many approximations .",
    "@xcite    by means of numerical experiments , walker and zettlemoyer @xcite have shown that the conventional bet theory predicts a monolayer volume smaller than the real value , when heterogeneous adsorption isotherms are analyzed .",
    "a similar result was obtained by corts and araya , @xcite when considering a gaussian distribution of adsorption energies .",
    "the authors showed that the estimated values of the monolayer volume from the bet equation diminishes with increasing degree of surface heterogeneity ( the width of the distribution of adsorption energies ) .",
    "more recently , nikitas @xcite has arrived to similar conclusions by considering both , surface heterogeneity and polyatomic character of the adsorbate . in ref",
    "@xcite , by using an extension of the flory - huggins polymer solution theory , @xcite the multilayer adsorption of polyatomic species was studied over a random heterogeneous surface . by particular cases analysis",
    ", the author concludes that one can obtain an underestimation of the true monolayer capacity of the order of @xmath2 , when the adsorbate occupies more than one lattice site .",
    "this underestimation is bigger , if an heterogeneous surface is considered .    in this work ,",
    "we study how the monolayer volume predicted by bet equation differs from its real value when considering both the adsorbate size and the surface topography , i. e. the space distribution of the adsorption energies over the solid surface .",
    "in particular , we consider the multilayer adsorption of polyatomic species on one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) homogeneous and heterogeneous bivariate surfaces . in each case , approximate analytic isotherms are built and validated by comparing with monte carlo simulation .",
    "then , we estimate the monolayer volume , by analyzing these isotherms with the conventional bet theory .    the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the lattice - gas model .",
    "next , in sections 3 and 4 , the multilayer adsorption isotherms for homogeneous and heterogeneous surfaces are obtained .",
    "the dependence of the monolayer volume on the surface topography and the adsorbate size is presented in section 5 .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section 6 .",
    "a simple lattice - gas model to describe the multilayer adsorption of polyatomic molecules on homogeneous surface has been recently proposed .",
    "@xcite the surface is modeled by a regular lattice of @xmath3 sites , all with the same adsorption energy @xmath4 , and the adsorbate is represented by @xmath5-mers ( linear particles that have @xmath5 identical units ) .",
    "a @xmath5-mer adsorbed on the surface occupies @xmath5 sites of the lattice with an energy @xmath6 and can arrange in many configurations .",
    "this property is called adsorption with multisite occupancy . on the other hand , for higher layers ,",
    "the adsorption of a @xmath5-mer is exactly onto an already absorbed one , with an adsorption energy of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the monolayer structure reproduces in the remaining layers .",
    "this phenomenon is called _ pseudomorphism _ and , for example , is observed experimentally in the adsorption of straight chain saturated hydrocarbon molecules .",
    "@xcite finally , following the spirit of the bet theory , no lateral interactions are considered and only interactions among the layers are introduced .",
    "figure 1 in ref  @xcite shows a snapshot representing this lattice - gas model .",
    "we modify the model to consider the adsorption on a heterogeneous substrate : now the adsorption energy @xmath8 depends on each site @xmath9 of the surface .",
    "then , the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the total number of @xmath5-mers , @xmath12 the occupation variable which can take the values 0 if the corresponding site is empty or 1 if the site is occupied , and @xmath13 is the number of @xmath5-mers on the surface ( monolayer ) , @xmath14 the hamiltonian in eq  ( [ ham1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath15 in the following sections , we will look for analytic solutions of the model in 1d and 2d , for homogeneous and heterogeneous surfaces .",
    "for the previous model , a simple analytic expression of the multilayer adsorption isotherm can be obtained in few particular cases . if the surface is homogeneous ( @xmath16 for all @xmath9 ) and @xmath17 , it is easy to demonstrate @xcite that @xmath18}. \\label{bet}\\ ] ] here , @xmath19 is the total coverage , @xmath20 is the pressure , @xmath21 is the saturation pressure of the bulk liquid and @xmath22 is a constant defined as @xmath23 , \\label{c}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the inverse temperature ( being @xmath25 the boltzmann constant and @xmath26 the absolute temperature ) .",
    "eq  ( [ bet ] ) is the well - known bet isotherm @xcite and can be applied to systems in any dimension .    in the case of @xmath27 , it is only possible to obtain an exact solution in 1d @xcite @xmath28^{1/2 } \\right\\}. \\label{dimer}\\ ] ] equation  ( [ dimer ] ) is the exact dimer isotherm for the multilayer adsorption on 1d homogeneous surface .",
    "as it has been previously shown , @xcite the values of the monolayer volume predicted by eqs  ( [ bet ] ) and ( [ dimer ] ) are different : if a dimer isotherm is analyzed , the value of the monolayer capacity arising from using bet characterization is smaller than the real one .    in general , the multilayer isotherm corresponding to the model of eq  ( [ ham2 ] ) can not be expressed by one equation only . to describe the isotherm ,",
    "it is necessary to give two functions .",
    "@xcite let us assume that an analytical expression of the monolayer adsorption isotherm is known , @xmath29 , being @xmath30 the chemical potential and @xmath31 ( the fugacity ) a function of the monolayer coverage @xmath32 .",
    "then , the following equations can be deduced @xcite : @xmath33 and @xmath34 equations  ( [ pre ] ) and ( [ cub ] ) constitute the multilayer adsorption isotherm . by using the surface coverage ( @xmath35 ) as a parameter , we can calculate the relative pressure from eq  ( [ pre ] ) .",

    "in fact , eqs  ( [ pre ] ) and ( [ cub ] ) still hold if the particles in the monolayer interact among them and with the solid surface .",
    "although we could use this formalism to determine the multilayer adsorption isotherm for a given surface heterogeneity ( for which it would be necessary to have an appropriate monolayer isotherm ) , we have chosen to use a different strategy .",

    "it should be noticed that eq  ( [ integral ] ) is strictly and generally valid only for noninteracting monomers ( @xmath17 ) , which is a quite unrealistic case .",
    "if adsorbed particles occupy more than one site ( multisite occupancy ) or interact with each other , then the local coverage at a point with a given adsorptive energy depends on the local coverage on neighbor points with different adsorptive energies and , in general , eq  ( [ integral ] ) should be replaced by a much more complex expression .",

    ", we will study the multilayer adsorption on 1d and 2d heterogeneous surfaces . as local isotherm",
    ", we will use eqs  ( [ cub ] ) and ( [ pre2d ] ) .",
    "then , we will compare the multilayer adsorption isotherm obtained by using eq  ( [ isoh ] ) and the calculated with mc simulation .      as we said in the introduction",
    ", the heterogeneity is modeled by two kinds of sites ( bivariate surface ) : _ strong _ sites with adsorption energy @xmath62 and _ weak _ sites with adsorption energy @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) . in 1d , where the surface is represented by a chain of sites with periodic boundary conditions , these sites form patches of size @xmath65 @xmath66 , which are spatially distributed ( topography ) in a deterministic alternate way .    the number of possible configurations of a single @xmath5-mer in an empty lattice is @xmath3 .",
    "however , due to periodicity , eq  ( [ isoh ] ) has only @xmath67 terms ( with many of them having the same adsorption energy ) .",
